FT  06 SEP 93 / Japanese agree to further cut in cars for EC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission and Japanese officials have agreed on a limit of
980,000 cars entering the EC this year from Japan, some 17.6 per cent below
last year's level.
The deal, reached in Tokyo after two days of intense talks, goes much
further than an earlier agreement to curb exports by 9.4 per cent to 1.09m
units.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic affairs commissioner, said it would
'ease pressure on European manufacturers at a difficult time'.
Japan, however, won agreement that the level of Japanese car exports can be
adjusted in mid-year, not only if EC market conditions deteriorate
substantially from initial forecasts, but also if they improve.
Exports to the UK are maintained under the new agreement at 202,800 on the
grounds that market conditions are improving there. Exports to France are to
fall to 69,000 from an initially agreed 77,300, while those to Italy drop to
38,800 from 42,900, Spain to 29,300 from 34,200 and Portugal to 39,000 from
41,500.
Under a monitoring arrangement aimed at gradually opening up the EC market,
Japan limits its car exports to the EC to a mutually agreed level. This is
due to end in 1999.
The earlier reduction agreement reached last April was based on a Commission
forecast that the EC car market would fall 6.5 per cent this year to 13m
units. However, demand fell 18.5 per cent in the first seven months,
prompting Brussels to ask for further cuts. The latest accord is based on
mutual recognition that EC car demand will reach some 11.7m units in 1993.
The Japanese car industry, which has been under severe pressure from weak
demand in its home market and fierce competition in the US in the wake of a
higher yen, expressed a mixture of concern and resignation. 'The EC market
is very weak and there has been a feeling that a deep cut cannot be avoided.
But any cut of more than 10 per cent is going to present us with a very
difficult situation,' a representative of Mazda said.
Japanese car exports to the EC were already down 16 per cent in the first
half and fell 32 per cent in July alone.

<TEXT>
PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian head of state, may be reinstated as king
under a constitution to be adopted next week. After a weekend of confusion,
palace officials yesterday released a faxed letter from Prince Sihanouk to
his son suggesting he might be persuaded to ascend the throne.
Prince Sihanouk yesterday also abruptly reversed a decision made only hours
earlier to sever ties with the United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac).
UN officials and western diplomats are not only exasperated by his frequent
changes of direction, but concerned that the new constitution being drafted
by parliament after UN-organised elections in May will not do enough to
uphold democracy and human rights.
Before his overthrow in a coup d'etat in 1970, Prince Sihanouk was known for
his paternalism and cavalier treatment of democratic institutions. His
friendships with the leaders of North Korea and China, where he spends much
time, have not improved his international reputation.
He is now in Beijing, and has invited the Untac chief, Mr Yasushi Akashi, to
meet him there on Friday.

Ms Jennifer Hillman, of the US trade representative's office, said on

FT  06 SEP 93 / Japan set to lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan is on the verge of reducing official interest rates in an
attempt to stimulate an ailing economy and restore consumer and corporate
confidence.
After an apparent leak from the central bank, Japanese media widely reported
yesterday that the official discount rate (ODR) would this month be cut from
2.5 per cent to 2 per cent, a post-war low.
The bank is scheduled to release its quarterly survey of business, the
tankan, this week, and bank officials are concerned that a lack of
confidence in the economy is prompting companies to cut capital investment
targets.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor, is known to be reluctant to set a new
ODR low, but the recent appreciation of the yen has further undermined
corporate confidence and delayed a recovery.
Japan's new coalition government has been urged by business groups to cut
income taxes or the ODR to stimulate the economy, but the finance ministry
has resisted a tax cut, arguing that revenues have fallen sharply in the
past year.
The seven coalition parties are divided over interest rate policy. Some
members of the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party,
argue that a fall in rates will hurt old people dependent on savings for
income.
There has also been concern in the government that another rate cut, the
seventh in two years, would lead to a surge in asset prices and unfairly
benefit banks, which are likely to profit from the rate spread.
But the government is under pressure from trading partners to prove that it
is attempting to rekindle growth. The current account surplus has expanded
for 28 consecutive months, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, would
like to take along a rate cut or some other initiative when he visits the US
late this month.
The lack of consumer confidence highlighted by falling retail sales was also
reflected in a survey released yesterday by the prime minister's office.
Only 4.8 per cent of 10,000 people surveyed thought their life had improved
over the past year, down from 7.3 per cent.
While the weakening economy has undermined consumer confidence, the annual
survey found that an accompanying reduction in overtime led to a fall from
39.9 per cent to 37.9 per cent in respondents who felt that they had no
spare time.

FT  06 SEP 93 / US Iraq arms probe will go on despite trial move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is moving ahead with a broadened investigation of
the US role in Iraq's arms procurement network and has not ruled out the
possibility of naming a special prosecutor, a senior Justice Department
official said at the weekend.
Mr John Hogan, a special assistant to Miss Janet Reno, the US
attorney-general, said that last week's decision to cancel the Iraqi loans
trial involving the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
(BNL) should not be seen as ending US efforts to probe arms-to-Iraq charges.
'My investigation is an on-going one dealing with the Iraqi procurement
network and concerning anyone involved, whether in goverment or out, whether
a current or former official,' he said. Mr Hogan, who also heads the Clinton
administration's inter-agency BNL task force, stressed that recent US media
reports suggesting a special prosecutor had been ruled out were wrong. He
said: 'No determination has been made yet.'
Democratic members of Congress last year demanded the naming of a special
prosecutor to examine allegations that Bush administration officials had
been involved in criminal wrong-doing in connection with US policies towards
Iraq. The Bush administration rejected the idea shortly before leaving
office, but President Bill Clinton promised that Miss Reno would re-evaluate
the charges.
Last Thursday, an agreement was reached allowing Mr Christopher Drogoul, the
former BNL Atlanta manager, to plead guilty to only three of the original
347 charges against him.
Mr Drogoul, who made Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) of loans that helped to
finance Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, had been due to
stand trial this week.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Clinton goes campaigning on all fronts: President is trying
to make up for time lost on the budget battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's first 100 days in office bogged down disastrously
in the struggle to pass his budget. Now he has set himself an ambitious
autumn agenda to make up for lost time, and even his most resolute
supporters are wondering if he has the capacity to carry it out.
Congress returns to Washington this week to wrap up the unfinished business
of its last session - the confirmation of Dr Joycelyn Elders to be surgeon
general, and a new national service programme - and already Mr Clinton is
preparing to put more indigestible meat on its plate.
Tomorrow, Vice-President Al Gore will unveil the results of his review of
the federal government's managements structures and procurement processes, a
report dubbed 'Reinventing Government' which is expected to produce
substantial savings as well as civil service job cuts.
Next week, the White House is expected to submit to congress legislation
implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico,
raising the curtain on a battle that has already bitterly divided the
Democratic party.
Just one week later, probably on September 22, Mr Clinton will announce the
outlines of his proposals for reforming the US health care system - a
massive undertaking that many politicians believe would on its own amply
occupy a whole presidential term.
And foreign affairs may demand Mr Clinton's attention, with the possibility
of a Middle East peace agreement, the likelihood of continued grief in
Bosnia, and the challenge of his first speech to the United Nations general
assembly.
Mr Clinton on Saturday defended his determination to advance on all fronts
at once.
'Health security, expanded trade and reinventing government really aren't
separate goals. They are part of a comprehensive strategy to promote
long-term growth, increased incomes, more jobs and a stronger American
community,' he said in his weekly radio speech. 'These pieces must all fit
together.'
But critics say that by trying to play too many tunes at once, Mr Clinton
may be ignoring a lesson most Americans learn before they are six from
'Sesame Street', the educational television programme: you've got to put
down the ducky if you want to play the saxophone.
The Gore report offers the best prospects of immediate dividends. White
House officials say around two-thirds of Mr Gore's proposals can be
implemented by executive order, without going through Congress.
But elements which would require legislation - such as a proposal to move
the federal government to budgeting over two years rather than one, as 21
states already do - are unlikely to make any headway in Congress.
Perhaps the greatest danger of the Gore report is excessive expectations.
The Washington Post reported yesterday that Mr Gore would aim for savings of
Dollars 108bn over five years, including Dollars 22bn from simplification of
government purchasing rules. It also said 252,000 civil service jobs would
be eliminated, with 'buy-out' incentives offered to encourage voluntary
departures.
Some administration officials say, however, that Mr Gore wants to avoid
overreaching and will claim much smaller savings, as well as warning that it
will take years to implement all of his proposals.
The review is expected to recommend halving middle management, aiming for a
ratio of one supervisor to every 15 workers, instead of the current ratio of
one to seven.
Nafta is a much more controversial element of Mr Clinton's autumn agenda.
Many of his fellow Democrats hotly oppose the treaty, which they believe
will lead to the transfer of US jobs to Mexico.
Even those who support Nafta in the abstract wonder why Mr Clinton should
waste political capital fighting for a treaty negotiated by his predecessor,
alienating in the process important Democratic constituencies such as the
trade unions.
Mr Robert Matsui, the leading Democratic cheerleader for Nafta in the House
of Representatives, complains that even his wife, who heads White House
efforts to rally grass-roots support for the treaty, will not say Nafta is
her number one priority. That number one priority for most Democrats,
including the White House, is healthcare.
The reform may be controversial. Many Democrats still favour a national
system like Canada's rather than the managed competition espoused by Mr
Clinton, under which employers would be encouraged to group themselves in
purchasing co-operatives in the hope that they will be able to negotiate
cheaper and more comprehensive insurance.
Elements of the plan are likely to face fierce opposition from businesses,
trade unions and industry lobbies, but health care reform is absolutely
essential to Mr Clinton's programme - the country demands it - and he should
receive support in Congress not just from the core of his fellow Democrats
but from many Republicans.
The biggest doubt about Mr Clinton's ability to reach these separate goals
stems from the political style he displayed in his first six months. His
willingness to compromise if opposed has encouraged most members of Congress
 -not just political heavyweights like Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia but
novices like Senator Patty Murray of Washington - to believe they can safely
humiliate the president in any trial of political wills.
That belief may now be impossible to dispel, and will handicap Mr Clinton
when the time comes to fight for his proposals.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Missing the unemployment-deregulation link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE about how to tackle high unemployment has taken a peculiar turn
in recent months. The British government, with the help of the European
Commission, has appeared able to characterise persistent unemployment as a
peculiarly continental European problem; a product of sclerotic and
over-regulated labour markets. The US and the UK are thus absolved from
continuing blame. Yes, unemployment in these countries was higher in the
1980s than in previous decades. But by embracing an agenda of labour market
deregulation, or 'flexibility', they claim to have found the solution.
This is certainly the approach that the UK plans to take both in Europe and
in the run-up to President Bill Clinton's autumn unemployment summit. Its
recent submission to the EC's review on competitiveness in Europe stated:
'There has been an upward trend in EC unemployment from cycle to cycle since
the late 1960s and an increasing proportion of long-term unemployed people.
This is evidence of inflexibility in, and over-regulation of, labour
markets. These factors deter employers from taking on new employees and
damage job creation.'
But the reality of the Anglo-Saxon labour market performance in the 1980s is
different from this rhetoric. First, while the record of the US economy in
terms of creating jobs has been superior to that of continental Europe, the
UK's record has been less impressive. Over the period 1982-90, UK employment
grew by an average 1.5 per cent a year, ahead of 0.9 per cent in the EC as a
whole, although behind the US rate of 2.1 per cent a year.
But Britain's peculiarly turbulent recent history has destroyed the
employment gains that deregulation might have delivered, as the charts show.
Both the US and French economies have steadily been adding new jobs since
1978, although at a much slower pace in France. The UK, by contrast, has
experienced an employment rollercoaster: between 1979 and 1983, employment
fell by 1.4m; the Lawson boom then replaced these lost jobs and added a net
1.9m more; but since 1990, the subsequent recession has removed the bulk of
the gains, leaving a net addition since 1978 of less than 500,000: 200,000
fewer than France. Over the period 1979-92, US employment grew by 19 per
cent, French employment by 3 per cent and UK employment by 0.4 per cent.
More important, this employment growth has co-existed with persistently
lower male employment in both Anglo-Saxon countries. On average over the
period 1982-90, and thus excluding the effects of either British recession,
9.7 per cent of British workers were unemployed according to the OECD,
higher than in both the US and France. But rising unemployment is only part
of the story. Male labour force participation in the US and UK has dropped
sharply over the past two decades as many have shifted from being
'unemployed' to 'economically inactive'. The common characteristic of these
two groups is that they do not have jobs; all can be classified as
'non-employed'. On average in the 1980s, 12 per cent of US males aged 25-54,
and 14.9 per cent of UK prime-age males were out of work compared to only
9.1 per cent in France.
The Anglo-Saxon economies have achieved one notable success: by encouraging
the creation of relatively low-wage service sector jobs which the male
non-employed have shunned, they have delivered many more employment
opportunities for women who want to enter the labour market. Over the period
1983-90, female employment in Britain grew by 22 per cent compared to 8 per
cent in France. The proportion of women of working age who have jobs rose to
nearly 60 per cent in both Britain and the US on average in the 1980s,
compared with less than 50 per cent in France and Germany.
But neither the US nor the UK experience suggests that a deregulated, more
'flexible', labour market means lower male non-employment. So the British
government's willingness to sing the praises of Anglo-Saxon style labour
market deregulation seems misplaced.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Arafat steps up drive to win Arab backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAMIS ANDONI, MARK NICHOLSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN, LONDON, ABU DHABI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASSIR Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, is
intensifying efforts to win Arab support for his outline deal with Israel,
and to reach an accommodation with Palestinian opposition to the plan,
before he signs the historic accord.
Mr Arafat at the weekend secured backing from the leaders of the mainstream
Fatah faction in the PLO and won full public support from King Hussein, the
Jordanian ruler, who had demurred at the pact, largely in anger at having
been left out of its formulation.
Less clearcut support came from the Syrian leader, President Hafez al-Assad,
yesterday when the PLO leader held several hours of talks in Damascus, on
the most important leg of his tour of Arab capitals.
Mr Assad said it was up to the Palestinian people and their institutions to
approve what they deemed fit.
Presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said Mr Arafat explained the deal 'and
circumstances surrounding it'. Mr Assad in turn 'affirmed Syria's attitude
in consolidating the rights of the brethren Palestinian people and that it
is up to this people and its institutions. . . to approve what it considers
fit'.
The Syrian leader has always sought to exercise strong influence over the
pace and course of the Arab partners' negotiations with Israel, and the
surprise announcement of a separate PLO deal with Israel will have come as a
severe shock.
But Mr Assad's approval could also be vital to softening resistance within
the 10 Damascus-based Palestinian opposition groups to the deal - something
which in turn would ease Mr Arafat's task of pushing the deal through the
PLO's broader decision-making bodies.
Broadening Palestinian backing is particularly important since Mr Arafat's
own Fatah faction stipulated, after three days of talks last week, that the
PLO-Israel deal must be ratified by the PLO central council, the 100-strong
body which represents most strands of the Palestinian movement.
Mr Arafat still has to contend with intense debate within the PLO over how
to accommodate Israeli demands without undermining the credibility and
legitimacy of the organisation among the Palestinian people.
Some PLO officials argue that to meet Israel's terms would require
modification of the 1968 PLO charter, articles of which in essence call for
the destruction of Israel. But Mr Arafat is likely to try to avoid this,
since any such amendments would require convening the 400-member Palestine
National Council, the movement's parliament-in-exile, which would provide a
potent forum for opposition to the outline deal with Israel.
Instead, Mr Arafat is working on a draft statement which would trigger
Israeli recognition of the PLO, basing this on the argument that the charter
has been superseded by events and by previous Palestinian resolutions
accepting the existence of Israel.
The United Arab Emirates yesterday voiced support for the PLO-Israeli deal,
Reuter reports from Abu Dhabi.
'We support this agreement,' said UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan
al-Nahayan. 'What satisfies Palestinians statisfies us and they are more
aware of their interests and the appropriate decision for them,' the
official UAE news agency WAM quoted him as saying.

<TEXT>
A WAVE of public sector strikes has brought ministries, hospitals and
airports to a standstill in Malawi. Post office and telecommunications
workers are threatening to join the dispute this week, writes Nicholas Young
in Lilongwe.
Civil servants demanding wage rises of more than 100 per cent have been on
strike since Thursday, and Lilongwe airport remains closed after action by
traffic controllers.
The government claims to have a settlement with health workers, but clinical
officers at Blantyre's Queen Elizabeth Hospital say they are treating only
emergency cases, and hospital administrators are in dispute with management.
Popular expectations have been raised by the result of the referendum in
June on Malawi's constitutional future. A majority voted in favour of a
multi-party system of government. President Hastings Banda's Malawi Congress
party, power for 28 years, is negotiating with opposition groups a general
election timetable.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Debt rescheduling 'urgent' for Algeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mourad Benhachenhou, a strong believer in the need to reschedule
Algeria's Dollars 26bn (Pounds 17bn) foreign debt, was appointed at the
weekend as finance minister in the Algerian government of Mr Redha Malek,
named prime minister two weeks ago.
Mr Benhachenhou was Finance Ministry secretary-general in the 1970s and
Algerian representative at the World Bank. After eight years there, he was
sacked in the spring of 1991 and conducted a vitiolic campaign in the
Algerian press against the team which, around Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, then
prime minister, had launched radical reforms in 1989-1991 aimed at freeing
the management of the country's economy.
The new minister recently wrote: 'Rescheduling becomes urgent, of little
cost if you compare it to the alternative of total economic collapse
threatening our country if the self-imposed policy of strangulation
continues.'
Talk of rescheduling the country's foreign debt has long been a taboo in
Algeria. Seeking an accommodation with the International Monetary Fund and
leading creditors such as France is the most urgent task confronting the new
government - annual repayment of principal and interest payments absorb
three quarters of Algeria oil and gas export income.
Mr Benhachenhou is one of two key appointees to the new government after the
sacking of Mr Belaid Abdessalam as prime minister. Colonel Selim Saadi, a
respected former military commander and agriculture minister, takes on the
interior portfolio. He is a close political friend of Mr Malek.
General Lamine Zeroual retains the defence portfolio. The new minister of
energy is the former deputy finance minister, Mr Ahmed Ben Bitour, while the
foreign portfolio goes to Mr Mohamed Salah Dembri, a diplomat and former
professor of French literature.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Milk, honey, razor wire: Julian Ozanne and Andrew Gowers in
an unlikely Promised Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and ANDREW GOWERS

<DATELINE>
   IT TAKES imagination to conceive of the Gaza Strip
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
360 square kilometres of desert dotted with squalid Palestinian refugee
camps and shanty towns - as the Promised Land. But that is what it has
become for 5,000 Jewish settlers who live there in red-tiled homes
surrounded by well-tended lawns.
Mediterranean waves break on deserted beaches, and fields full of ripening
vegetables and high-tech glasshouses sprout from the parched sand dunes. A
horse ranch offers pony-trekking for tourists, and Jewish settlers say they
never lock their homes and caravans. The Palm Beach Hotel, which caters for
ultra-orthodox Jews, even has a coffee shop called Milk and Honey.
The seeming idyllic life enjoyed by Jewish pioneers who have settled beyond
the 'Green Line' dividing Jews and Arabs is slightly surreal, however. The
coils of razor-wire and electrified fences, and the revolvers on the hips of
many settlers, serve as reminders of how tenuous life has been in the
settlement of Gush Katif, surrounded by 800,000 Palestinians.
Now, under a plan for Palestinian self-rule agreed in principle by Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the settlers of Gaza face an
uncertain future. Many see history repeating itself. They predict that they
will be sacrificed in the end by the government - just as the settlers in
the Egyptian Sinai desert were when Israel, in 1978, handed back the land it
had captured in 1967. (At least 70 of the families who made a last stand of
civil disobedience at the Yamit settlement in the Sinai, before being
forcibly evacuated by Israeli troops, now live in Gush Katif.)
'Morale could drop and people will leave, so the government hopes it will
have less of a problem down the road getting the rest of the Jews out,' said
Mr Yosef Shomron, an American who settled in Gush Katif nine months ago, for
a mixture of ideological and economic reasons.
'We are very angry and upset by the plan. There will be resistance to
leaving, like in Yamit, and one or two guys might go and shoot - but Jews
won't fight against other Jews, There will be no cult of violence,' he said,
sitting outside his prefabricated home.
Mr Shomron supports the Kach movement, which wants to transfer all the 1.9m
Palestinians out of the occupied territories. Others oppose the self-rule
plan for religious reasons. They believe that Gaza, Judea and Samaria
(otherwise called the West Bank) are part of the biblical Eretz Yisrael
(land of Israel).
'There will be no peace. Arab will kill Arab and they will turn their
violence against the Jewish state,' said Mrs Roberta Bienenfeld, a
translator who has lived here for 12 years. 'God is taking his revenge
against the state of Israel and all its unbelievers. We hope the plan won't
go through so we can keep our land that God gave us.'
Some settlers are more pragmatic. Mr Michael Goldschmidt, an immigrant from
South Africa and one of the founders of Gush Katif, has invested more than
Shk1m over 16 years in an agricultural business growing cherry tomatoes and
flower bulbs in greenhouses for export to the US and Europe. He said he
would be prepared to leave if the agreement with Palestinians delivered
'real peace to Israel'. 'We are very happy here but we will have to give up
one day,' he said, watching a group of Palestinian workers wash his flower
bulbs.
But even more moderate settlers, such as Mr Goldschmidt, are bewildered by
the agreement: 'We built everything here out of sand. It was nothing before
we came. Why do we have to give it up? We fought for it and captured it.
Israel is a small country - there is no gold here, so why do the Arabs want
our land? We have nowhere else to go. But we have to give it back because we
are weak and we are Jews.'

SEVEN Nigerian peace-keeping troops with the UN and at least 15 Somalis,
some of them women and children, were killed yesterday when a patrol tried
to shoot its way free of gunmen loyal to the Somali warlord General Mohamed
Farah Aideed, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
Somali gunmen also captured two Nigerian peace-keepers in the worst attack
on the 25,000-strong UN army in Somalia since August 8, when four US troops
were killed in an ambush.
The Nigerians, who had been surrounded by angry Somalis along a city road,
were killed before they could retreat, residents said. Nearby Italian other
UN troops were reported as having been prevented from helping them by
burning barricades and mobs.
The latest attack raised the UN death toll to 46 since June 5, when Gen
Aideed's supporters killed 24 Pakistani UN troops at the start of a campaign
against UN control of Somalia's rehabilitation.

OPPOSITION is growing to Ukraine's agreement to sell its half of the Black
Sea Fleet, and to return its nuclear warheads, to Russia.
The agreement, announced by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin after talks on Friday, was denounced by a Ukrainian
minister, Mr Valery Shmarov.
It was described by a deputy premier as 'nothing short of a disaster' and by
Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the nationalist opposition party Rukh, as
'high treason'.
Mr Kravchuk himself partly defended, partly denied, his alleged agreement to
the deal. General Konstantin Morozov, defence minister, said yesterday that
no agreement on the sale of the Ukrainian fleet had yet been concluded. Mr
Kravchuk stressed that details of both the sale of the fleet and the
transfer of the warheads had to be worked out by joint commissions.
Mr Yeltsin said after the meeting that the cost of the fleet would be set
against an estimated Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) which Kiev owes to Moscow
for oil and gas supplies.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Lira fall boosts Italian exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCREASED competitiveness of Italian exports, as a result of last
September's lira devaluation, has been confirmed by statistics just
published on trade for the first six months of 1993.
In this period, Italy's total exports rose 19 per cent. Within the EC, the
increase was lower, at 11 per cent. This reflected both the depressed state
of most European economies and fierce competition from other exporters, such
as the UK, which have also seen currencies depreciate sharply.
Even so, with the EC absorbing almost 60 per cent of Italian exports, the
impact on Italy's terms of trade was significant. More exports, combined
with its recession-hit economy, ensured a sharp turnround in trade balance.
Istat, the national statistics institute, said Italy recorded a half-year
overall surplus of L8,611bn (Pounds 3.6bn), against a L13,647bn deficit for
the 1992 first half. The rise is reflected in an improved performance in all
product sectors.
On a country basis, the most spectacular change has been in Italian-German
trade, as a result of a 30 per cent devaluation of the lira against the
D-mark. In the first half Italy recorded a surplus of L2,734bn with Germany,
its main trading partner, compared to a deficit of L3,995bn during the
equivalent period in 1992. Also, given a strong depreciation against the
French franc, Italian exports moved from a L1,689bn deficit to a L970bn
surplus.
In the case of the UK, the increase was substantial, but lower than those of
Germany and France. The trade balance with the UK increased from a L238bn
surplus to L1,453bn. The UK is Italy's third largest partner in the EC.

GREECE'S year-on-year inflation rate dropped to 14.6 per cent last month,
from 15.7 per cent in July, raising hopes that the government's target of 12
per cent by December can be achieved.
Although the inflation rate has gradually declined from a peak of 16.4 per
cent in March, it is still more than four times the European Community
average.
Progress in reducing inflation has been slower than expected, partly because
of the effects of price liberalisation in the services sector.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development points out, in a
new report on the Greek economy, that 'inflation expectations remain
strong', despite a marked decline in both the public sector borrowing
requirement and the current account deficit.
The report said exchange rate policy should be reformed by announcing in
advance the depreciation rate of the drachma against other European
currencies, so as to 'reinforce confidence in the government's
anti-inflation posture.'
The report forecast that Greece's gross national product would grow by about
1 per cent this year, down from 1.25 per cent in 1992 but ahead of the
European average.
However, it warned that the government could not afford to relax its
stabilisation policy before an election due by next spring.
Revenues for the first eight months of 1993 fell well short of the budget
target, despite the Finance Ministry's efforts to curb tax evasion and speed
collection of tax arrears.
According to the national accounting office, revenues rose by 13.4 per cent
against a budget forecast of 26.4 per cent.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Ericsson set to win Polish telecoms deal

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications company is expected to win a
Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) defence telecommunications contract from Poland.
It is the country's first such contract to be awarded to a supplier outside
the former Warsaw Pact.
Mr Roman Czerwinski, a deputy industry and trade minister, said at the
weekend at an arms exhibition in Kielce that the government would be taking
the decision this week.
Under the contract Ericsson, which was competing with Marconi and Racal of
the UK, would produce mobile radio network equipment under a joint venture
with the Unimor factory in Gdansk. Deliveries are to be spread out until the
year 2000.
Ericsson has so far failed to win big contracts to supply civilian
telecommunications equipment to Poland. Under the country's World
Bank-financed programme most of the telephone systems in the longer term are
to come from three suppliers, of whom two, Alcatel of France and AT&amp;T, the
US group, have already been chosen. Siemens of Germany and Northern Telecom,
the Canadian company, are competing to become the third supplier.
Unimor, which makes TV sets, would control two thirds of the equity in the
proposed joint venture with Ericsson, involving a Dollars 25m investment in
new technology.
Meanwhile Bofors, another Swedish company, is renewing pre-war links with
Huta Stalowa Wola, a large defence works in south eastern Poland which has
for over a year been selling components for production of Bofors' 40mm gun
system.
Talks are under way on a co-operation agreement to produce entire turrets
for an armoured combat vehicle at the Polish works.
Bofors is also looking to the Mesko arms works to provide parts for its Bill
anti-tank missile. Mesko already has a barter agreement with Thomson- CSF,
the French arms group which is delivering artillery fuses to the plant and
is also interested in co-operating in production of rockets and rocket
systems.
The Kielce arms fair is the first of its kind in an area where around
four-fifths of Poland's arms industry is located. The industry is suffering
from a dearth of orders from the Polish army as well as a collapse of former
Soviet bloc markets. However, British and US arms producers were conspicuous
at Kielce by their absence.

FT  06 SEP 93 / France may veto farm trade accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday revived its threat to veto the European Community's draft
farm trade accord with the US unless substantial changes are made to the
agreement.
Over the weekend, a senior French official warned that France would tell its
EC partners at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on September 20 that
France would refuse to sign the Blair House accord unless agricultural
discussions with the US were reopened.
'Unless it is now reopened,' the official said, 'there will be a crisis in
September rather than December' - the target date for finishing the Uruguay
Round of global trade liberalisation talks.
France in the next few weeks will step up its campaign to persuade the rest
of the Community of the need to water down the restraints on European farm
exports agreed last November.
France wants to secure the support of a majority of member states at the
Council of Ministers meeting. But the prospect of Paris using its veto on
the issue marks a toughening of the rhetoric of the Balladur government. In
its five months in office, it has sought to negotiate itself out of its
isolation on agriculture, rather than publicly brandish its veto.
'If the Commission does not budge,' said the official yesterday, 'we will
invoke the Luxembourg compromise (the convention by which a veto may be used
in defence of a vital national interest).
'And if it does not budge, the Commission, which is charged with the
solidarity of the Community, will be responsible for its breaking up.'
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's new director-general, is due in Paris on
Wednesday to see Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, and is expected to
warn him that re-opening the Blair House accord would be counterproductive
for Europe in terms of winning new US concessions, and would cause the
Uruguay Round to miss its December 15 negotiating deadline.
In Bonn yesterday, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, indicated he
hoped France would settle for a reinterpretation of the agreement rather
than renegotiation.
While Germany has made sympathetic noises over the French position, it has
made clear it does not want to reopen the accord.
'We have had a delegation of experts in Paris,' Mr Kinkel told German radio.
'Perhaps we will come to a point through interpretations where a change in
the Blair House accord will not be necessary.' He added that a solution
might be found before the September 20 meeting of EC ministers.
However, Mr Kinkel said he understood France's opposition to the accord,
which entails a 21 per cent reduction in subsidised farm exports.
France, which has sought in particular to ensure the agreement is compatible
with the EC's own farm reform, is likely to deny the need for haste on
agriculture when many non-farm aspects of the Gatt negotiations are behind
schedule. It will try to secure new concessions by putting the onus on other
member states more anxious than France about the December deadline.
Meanwhile, French farmers, who are planning mass demonstrations on September
15, are now accusing the government of duplicity, of showing a softer face
on Gatt to France's partners than to its farmers.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Paris seeks pact on flexible working hours: Labour minister
proposes measures to combat France's record unemployment rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JULIA PASCAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Mr Edouard Balladur is to invite France's employers and
trade unions to strike an historic bargain on the flexible working of
shorter hours, in an attempt to reduce the country's record 11.7 per cent
unemployment rate.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Michel Giraud, France's labour
minister, confirmed he would make the proposal when he and Mr Balladur meet
employers and union leaders today to get their final views on the
government's planned five-year labour pact. The bill is shortly to go before
parliament.
The conservative government has responded to employers' demands for more
flexible labour patterns by setting an annual, rather than weekly, cap on
working hours. But in a shift from last spring's election campaign, in which
it mocked Socialist calls for shorter hours, the government is now inviting
employers to join unions in negotiating a reduction in the 39-hour maximum
work week.
'I know that many unions are much more positive about the 'annualisation' of
working hours if there is the prospect of reducing these hours overall,'
said Mr Giraud. 'If companies which want the flexibility of annualised work
limits are ready to make an effort in reducing the length of work, why not?'
This suggested trade-off is part of Mr Giraud's attempt to reverse France's
structural tendency to shed jobs faster and to create employment more slowly
than most other leading industrial countries. By July, there were 3.21m
unemployed, with the loss of jobs in the second half of the year still
officially forecast to outstrip the disappearance of 175,000 jobs in the
first half.
The labour minister described the priority the government was giving to
unemployment as 'obsessional', reflecting society's widespread fears about
the problem. He cited a recent survey showing that eight in every 10 French
schoolchildren feared they would end up in the dole queue.
But in contrast to the piecemeal approach of the Socialist government which
produced six labour laws in five years, Mr Giraud claims his catch-all
programme for the next five years will tackle France's fundamental problems
of high labour costs, inadequate training, and rigid practices, many dating
back to the Socialist-led Popular Front of the 1930s and before.
Measures include a progressive shift of family allowance charges from the
salaries of lower-paid workers to the central state budget, a five-year
freeze on new welfare charges on payrolls, and tax breaks for job-creating
companies, as well as deregulation.
At the rhetorical level, France's new centre-right government insists on the
need for the European Community, even the Gatt world trade organisation, to
have social policies. But Mr Giraud says: 'I am a liberal, and we don't want
to put social policy handcuffs on ourselves, or others.'
In domestic political terms, Mr Giraud, a member of the RPR Gaullist party,
insists he is in no way attacking France's 'essential social achievements'.
Indeed, he says he would like stronger unions in France, and in the priority
which he and Mr Balladur have given to 'social dialogue', the unions 'have a
chance to reinforce themselves'. He does not, for instance, like to alarm
the unions by using the word 'flexibility' too much.
But he clearly approves of the concept. In May he proposed the government
should step in to help compensate workers who took pay cuts to avoid
redundancies. He had to withdraw the idea when some companies were believed
to be making false threats of job cuts to get the state to pay part of their
pay cheques. However, his five-year plan contains a clever modification of
something even more sensitive - France's minimum wage, the Smic, which many
experts feel has helped price low-skilled workers out of the job market.
'We are not touching the structure of the Smic,' says Mr Giraud. 'To do that
would needlessly stir up a confrontation.' But the new law would let
companies pay young workers below the Smic rate, if they devote most of the
saving to training the lower-paid young. Another move would be to start
schoolchildren on 'pre-apprenticeships' at 14, instead of delaying all
vocational/manual training until they leave school at 16.
France still has no fewer than 72 labour laws dating from 1936-37, and many
of these need updating, says Mr Giraud. One of these is a 1937 law which,
for bank employees, still decrees two consecutive days of rest.
Another anomaly, common to all European countries, which Mr Giraud hopes he
can settle is Sunday trading. The Virgin Megastore on the Champs Elysees has
brought this issue to a head by defying the 1906 law against Sunday opening.
Essentially, Mr Giraud is passing this buck to local prefectures, but with
the clear indication that they should let shops in tourist spots open on
Sundays.
'Against clandestine employment, I am totally inflexible,' says Mr Giraud,
complaining that companies which fail to give their workers proper pay and
social protection 'distort competition' against law-abiding companies.
A subtle way of discouraging travail noir is the draft law's new experiment
of 'ticket-service'. The idea is to encourage people into the provision of
part-time services, such as running errands for the elderly, and being paid
for these services in tickets bought at post offices. 'There's nothing wrong
with services,' insists Mr Giraud, seeking to reverse his countrymen's
tendency to think that only production counts.
A big demonstration was planned in Jeumont, near the Belgian border, today
in protest at 476 sackings at Jeumont Industrie, Julia Pascal writes. The
company was an electrical components subsidiary of Schneider before being
taken over this year by nuclear parts group Framatome.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Report predicts further rises for D-Mark: James Blitz on the
likely effects of repaying Bundesbank for intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc, Danish krone and Belgian franc have weakened in recent
weeks against the D-Mark, as currency dealers take the view that their
central banks need to reduce short-term interest rates to stimulate economic
growth.
But foreign exchange analysts believe these currencies could come under more
pressure in the next few months as a result of their central banks' reserve
management operations, in the wake of the recent crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
In a report published today, Idea, the market intelligence group, says
reserve management should strengthen the D-Mark over the next few months.
The central banks of France, Denmark and Belgium need to buy D-Marks from
the foreign exchange market to repay the Bundesbank for supporting their
currencies through intervention during last month's ERM crisis.
Under ERM rules, the Bundesbank would need to be repaid within three months
of the intervention, giving these central banks a repayment deadline of
mid-November.
The central banks also need to build up their foreign exchange reserves if
they are to regain control over short-term movements in their currencies'
exchange rates. In France's case, these reserves were heavily depleted at
the height of the crisis.
As they buy D-Marks and sell their own currencies, central banks will tend
to have an impact on short-term movements in exchange rates. Foreign
exchange dealers, therefore, have been wondering what impact this will have.
Idea calculates that there are likely to be some DM75bn (Pounds 30bn) of
D-Mark purchases by European central banks over the next six months. 'To
place these flows in perspective, central banks are likely to effectively
finance more than two years worth of German current account deficits in the
next six months,' says Mr Alan Ruskin, the report's author.
The report suggests that these operations put a cap on the value of the
dollar against the D-Mark. But their impact on European currencies will
depend on exactly how the central banks manage their reserve building
operations.
Idea's report says the Bundesbank and the Bank of France could, between
them, buy DM91bn of the German currency and sell FFr320bn (Pounds 36.6bn) of
the French currency, in a move that would greatly strengthen the D-Mark's
rate against the French franc.
But both central banks could diversify the operations, using other
currencies to cap the rise in the D-Mark. Instead of buying DM91bn, they
could, for example, buy Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) of the US currency and
DM76bn of the German. 'The net effect is still very D-Mark positive,' says
Idea.
The report suggests the scope for central banks to recoup reserves without
hurting their currencies will be far more limited than in previous crises.
In the old ERM system, there was a propensity for the newly devalued
currencies to move towards the top of their ERM bands after a realignment,
on the expectation that the new bands would last. This time, the widening of
the ERM bands and the expectation of interest rate cuts means the value of
these currencies will weaken in any event.
The reserve transactions of the central banks could also be difficult to
interpret if the French authorities take advantage of provisions to roll
forward borrowings under the EC's very short-term financing facility.

FT  06 SEP 93 / VW starts inquiry into surging loss at Seat subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has ordered an examination of the
books at Seat, following a rapid and unexpected surge in losses at the
German car group's Spanish subsidiary.
He is believed to have commissioned a special audit after receiving reports
of a looming deficit at Seat this year of DM800m (Pounds 320m) or more, and
requests for an urgent DM1bn cash injection to save the company from
collapse.
The subsidiary, which was taken over in 1986 and operates some of the most
modern and low-cost manufacturing sites in the group, lost DM180m last year
on sales of DM10bn.
The need for an investigation adds to the burdens of Mr Piech, who is
already weighed down by a bitter clash with General Motors of the US over
allegations of industrial espionage.
At the same time, he is battling to restore his personal credibility after
having had to back away from earlier promises that the struggling VW
automotive group would return to profit this year.
Mr Piech, VW chairman since January 1, last Friday took on extra
responsibilities - for auditing and government relations - after discussions
with the group's supervisory board on measures to save Seat.
No rescue decisions were taken, and a statement issued after the sitting
referred only to 'cause for concern' at Seat and in North American and
Asian-Pacific markets.
Whatever the findings of the audit, which will be reported directly to Mr
Piech, VW appears to have little alternative but to step in with a salvage
operation which could wreck the chairman's hopes of a successful first
financial year at the group.
VW lost DM1.6bn in the first half, although the supervisory board said on
Friday that it expected a positive result in the third quarter for the
German parent and the group as a whole.
The most likely source of cash for Seat is an intra-group transfer of DM1bn
in return for which the parent would take control of the Spanish
subsidiary's Pamplona plant, currently used to manufacture VW-marque Polo
cars.
The sale had already been planned and now it seemed advisable to bring it
forward, Seat said at the weekend.
The company blamed its troubles on the motor industry slump and the
devaluation of the peseta, which had pushed up the cost of imported parts.
It made no reference to the relative advantages for selling prices of the
peseta's loss of value.
In the first half of this year, while VW group vehicle production fell 19
per cent, output of Seat cars tumbled 34 per cent.
VW has invested more than DM4bn in its Spanish business in the past two
years, spending mainly on a new lean production factory at Martorell, and
updating other sites. Pamplona has also been fully upgraded.
In July, Seat scrapped a joint venture with Suzuki of Japan to build 150,000
mini-cars a year in Barcelona.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Israel says peace deal on track: Palestinian officials warn
internal PLO agreement may take weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL said yesterday that it was on course to conclude deals by next week
on recognising the Palestine Liberation Organisation and on Palestinian
self-rule, despite continuing haggling over the terms governing recognition.
Israeli ministers were united after yesterday's cabinet meeting in
proclaiming that the sole remaining obstacles to signing the two agreements
were matters of wording, not principle - in particular the wording of a
statement to be issued by the PLO dissociating itself from terrorism and
disavowing significant parts of its founding charter.
As a measure of mounting confidence within Israel over the prospects of a
real peace breakthrough, stock prices on the Tel Aviv exchange rose to a
record high yesterday, with the Mishtanim share index rising 10 points to
close at 226.76.
However, Palestinian officials in Washington cautioned that it could take
weeks for the PLO to push the outline agreement through its internal
decision-making bodies. 'The (PLO) executive committee is meeting Thursday,
after that the central council. It is going to take some time,' said one
official.
The agreement drew guarded support yesterday from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, a key figure in the Middle East as leader of Israel's chief enemy.
The deal had been sharply criticised in official Syrian press, but in his
first statement on the subject, Mr Assad said it was up to Palestinians to
decide what they deem fit on a negotiated offer from Israel of interim
self-rule in occupied territories.
This was less than the public support sought by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman, who visited Damascus yesterday, and threw the ball back in the
Palestinian court.
Israeli and US officials have both expressed the hope that the 'declaration
of principles' governing early autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho and
covering Palestinian empowerment elsewhere in the West Bank could be signed
in Washington on September 13, at the end of the present round of peace
talks.
Both sides are determined to sustain momentum behind the breakthrough
agreement on limited self-rule for the Palestinians, unveiled more than a
week ago after secret talks in Oslo.
Mr Arafat is also seeking to accommodate internal Palestinian opposition to
the agreement, partly to expedite its approval by PLO decision-making
bodies, and has sought a meeting with Mr George Habash, leader of the
hard-line Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
He is then expected to visit the Gulf, where he is likely to seek political
and financial backing for the agreement. Gulf foreign ministers convened in
Riyadh yesterday to discuss the deal.
The Israeli government is equally determined not to see momentum lost. 'No
one has an alternative. It is impossible to go back. There is no going
back,' Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, told Israel radio, echoing a
statement made by Mr Arafat in his first-ever Israeli television interview
on Saturday.
Israel has signalled it would be happy to sign only the self-rule agreement
in a week's time in Washington, but the PLO is holding out for a
simultaneous deal on recognition. Mr Peres has said both agreements stand on
their own feet and are not dependent on each other.
The Palestinians, however, believe recognition is vital and should be
accorded before the final signing of the outline agreement in Washington,
partly to help the PLO muster broader support for the deal among its Arab
and Palestinian opponents.
Meanwhile, supporters and opponents of the peace proposals in Israel are
beginning to gather their forces in public demonstrations.
At least 40,000 people chanted their backing for the government in a rally
organised by the Peace Now movement in Tel Aviv on Saturday. Israeli
settlers and other rightwingers hostile to the deal plan to respond tomorrow
with a mass demonstration.
Israeli police minister Moshe Shahal said yesterday that civil guard units
would police Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, in an apparent
bid to calm Jewish settlers' anger over the Palestinian self-rule pact.

FT  06 SEP 93 / US investors turn from UK to continental Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INVESTORS who helped drive the London stock market to new peaks in the
last days of August are turning their attention to other European bourses,
threatening to undermine the UK equity market's recent rally.
Concern over US investment diverting to other European markets, particularly
France, Spain and Italy, may cast a shadow over the UK market this week
after contributing to a 1.4 per cent fall last week.
Some US funds have doubled their rate of investment in European equities
since the widening of ERM currency bands at the beginning of August.
The ensuing falls in French and German interest rates have reduced the
relative advantages of UK equities, according to London and New York
analysts with leading US investment banks.
US securities analysts and fund managers in New York, Boston and London said
they are now attracted to continental European markets after their recent
buying spree in London.
Mr Marcus Grub, of Salomon Brothers International in London, said he
favoured France, Spain, Italy and Germany over the UK. Goldman Sachs
International, is advising US investors to be 'overweight Europe', but puts
the focus on France and Spain rather than the UK.
US-based analysts are cooling on UK stocks. Mr Kevin McCarey, who runs a
Dollars 150m (Pounds 99m) pension fund that invests in European equities for
the Boston-based Fidelity group, says he has been shifting some money out of
the UK recently.
Mr McCarey is hoping to find bargains in continental Europe, especially
Italy, Spain and Germany. He explained: 'Interest rates are the highest in
Spain and Italy; therefore they have the most room to come down.'
Mr Heydon Traub, a fund manager with State Street Global Advisers in Boston
who runs a Dollars 2bn global equity fund that is 50 per cent invested in
Europe, and 10 per cent in the UK, has not taken any money out of the London
market recently because the fund has been underweight in UK stocks for a
long time.
Mr Traub said: 'The UK went through some tough economic times over the last
couple of years, and the market did not go down very much to reflect that,
so from our point of view it has been overvalued for a year or two. Given
that, we don't expect it to be a strong performer.'
Mr Traub said that in spite of strong earnings this year UK shares would
still not be as attractive as other European stocks: 'We expect UK earnings
growth to be really strong, but the price you have to pay for that is pretty
high now. You don't have to pay up as much in other markets like France.'
London has been the main beneficiary of recent US investment in Europe,
which is by far the most favoured destination for US stock investment.
Europe accounts for about 72 per cent of US investment portfolio overseas.

FT  06 SEP 93 / Whitehall battle looms over move to cut Youth Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department for Education is to call for Youth Training, the Pounds
850m-a-year work-based training programme, to be cut to the bone in favour
of a rapid expansion of further education.
The department wants to divert the bulk of the Department of Employment's
Youth Training budget to help fund its plans to expand college-based
training.
The proposal, to be submitted to the Treasury in the next few days, will set
the scene for a fierce Whitehall battle over the programme which is the
centre piece of the government's training effort. It would mark a sharp
shift in policy away from work-based training for young people.
The plan will antagonise business leaders who have been encouraged by the
government to run the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils, which have been
developed in the past two years.
The DFE's initiative, which is being led by Mr Tim Boswell, the further
education minister, would be strongly resisted by Mr David Hunt, the
employment secretary. It is likely to be a major cause of controversy during
the current public spending round.
The government guarantees a place on YT to all 16 to 19-year-olds. It offers
them a combination of work and college-based training.
About 220,000 young people are on the scheme, down from about 300,000 a year
ago, largely because the numbers staying in full-time education have risen
sharply.
Youth Training is the largest single programme run by the Tecs. The
government allows the councils to use surpluses made from YT to fund other
activities, particularly the promotion of better training of people in work
and the creation of new jobs. Youth Training is the first step in their plan
to develop programmes for 'lifetime learning.'
The Confederation of British Industry last month endorsed a letter, written
by Tecs' representatives, to Mr Hunt.
The letter, published today in Tec Agenda, the regular bulletin for
directors of Tecs, said they believed work-based training was essential for
large numbers of young people who, it said, would enter dead-end,
low-skilled jobs rather than go to college.

FT  04 SEP 93 / German recycling scheme credits extended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN municipalities and waste management companies yesterday agreed to
extend credits to save the national recycling scheme from bankruptcy.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, said his controversial recycling
scheme still offered a viable solution for disposing of household waste.
More funds are expected from industry to meet the scheme's DM860m deficit.
Critics said yesterday's decision was a temporary rescue which would not
cure the system's structural problems.

FT  04 SEP 93 / As they say in Europe: Red wine equals red-blooded rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READING newspapers on holiday is often a disappointing experience. La
Montagne, in the Auvergne, made one look hard for the Paris papers to find
something that did not read like a freesheet, yet cost almost as much as the
FT. Luckily, south of the Loire, there is that great consolation, Midi
Olympique.
This is not the first time I have been entranced by MO, the greatest
sporting weekly in the world. Its sole concern is rugby union and so,
naturally, it is published in Toulouse. Its appearance is unusual: a large
broadsheet of hugely unattractive yellow paper. The masthead is unchanged
from the day of its foundation in 1919. It represents an aspect of popular
French (and, therefore, European) civilisation that has been ignored for too
long.
My first holiday edition of MO splashed the headline: 'Un Week-end tres
muscle.' The story revelled in the sendings-off, injuries and spectacular
examples of dirty play that had characterised the first round of friendly
matches that precede the official opening of the French season this weekend.
Midi Olympique adopts a vigorous, macho approach that makes John Wayne seem
like Woody Allen. To followers of the game in other nations, the fascination
of French rugby is its beauty-and-the-beast quality. Brilliant ball skills
are, somehow, allied to devil-may-care brutality.
The only other nation to have produced a similar combination is South
Africa, which might help to explain why the resumption of sporting contacts
between the cockerel and the springbok has had such a devastating effect on
relations between the two countries.
The edition of MO which prompted such musings answered other questions rugby
fans have pondered for years. How, for example, did the game come to
flourish in southern France, between the Alps and the Atlantic, particularly
in the deep south-west? Why is its social infrastructure so different from
the country from which it was imported?
Midi Olympique published extracts from a survey of the 'political geography
of rugby' in which one authority observed: 'Often aristocratic, but almost
always bourgeois or university-led in Scotland, England and Ireland, working
class in Wales, rugby in France remains essentially local and the worthy
offspring.'
Geographically, French rugby coincides with strongholds of the left, with
the Langue d'Oc, as opposed to the offical French of the north. It is
republican and often peasant. The great player of years ago, Amedee
Domenech, proclaimed: 'Rugby votes left.' Hence the gulf between French and
English players and fans, bridged only when the occasional Englishman goes
off to run a bar in the shadow of the Pyrenees.
In its urban manifestations, French rugby coincides with one-industry towns
where the club becomes another centre of local cohesion. The report quoted
in MO said the backbone of any team is found in 'teachers, farmers,
municipal officials and barmen, where intellectuals, like the bourgeois,
have only a modest role (as distinct from the Anglo-Saxon countries.) If the
British monarchy formed its officers with the help of the strict education
provided by rugby, the republic filled its strongholds of the south-west
with the great grandsons of the Third Estate of 1789 and the studious pupils
of the 'black hussars of the Republic'.' In other words, republican
teachers.
Anybody who finds this hard to grasp has only to turn to a column of local
news: 'Marriage at Narbonne-Corbieres club.' The story runs: 'On Saturday
August 4 at 4pm, there were joined together at the church of Marcorignan the
scrum-half Michel Barbaste (the new Narbonne manager) and Nathalie Belzons,
daughter of the former Narbonne player Andre Belzons who runs, with his wife
Nadine, the Narbonne clubhouse and bar at the Cassayet ground. The bride's
brother is the present Narbonne number eight, Gilles Belzons, who follows in
his father's footsteps.' Even a Welsh newspaper might have offered a
sympathetic gesture to the bride.
The last edition of MO to appear during my holiday revealed more evidence of
the roots of French rugby. An official had drawn up a regional league table
which showed where the best rugby was played. At the top was Midi-Pyrenees,
at the bottom Brittany and Normandy.
A thought which must have struck others suddenly struck me: the league table
reflected the relative importance of red and white wine. The less red, the
lower the quality of the rugby. No wine means no rugby, except in Paris.
English rugby runs on beer, of course. And everyone knows the grape and the
grain do not mix.

FT  04 SEP 93 / The dissident who reckons there's nothing to be done: John
Lloyd is confronted with a bleak view of Russia's future when he meets
intellectual Vladimir Bukovsky, a Soviet exile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF VLADIMIR Bukovsky cannot be president of Russia, he will have no more to
do with it. It is the last straw. 'After all', he says, 'even in the country
which I have made my home and which owes me nothing (Britain) I can be
anything I want except the king of it.'
Bukovsky is one of the handful of dissidents, expelled from the Soviet Union
in the early 1970s, whose prominence grew in exile (in Cambridge, as a don)
and who have returned when the power which threw him out collapsed. He has
tried to take an active part in the new politics but, in Moscow recently, he
told a round table of intellectuals and politicians that 'the more I return
here, the less hope I have of its reform.'
Bukovsky earned the right to speak the hard way: arrested and given a
12-year sentence in prisons, camps and mental hospitals in 1961 for
attending the reading of a poem on Mayakovsky's suicide 30 years earlier.
The poet, among the greatest of the literary enthusiasts for Soviet power,
committed suicide when he could no longer fit his Bolshevik idealism to the
tortuous path being taken by Stalin towards complete power.
In his memoirs, published in English as To Build a Castle, Bukovsky speaks
of his generation (or that tiny idealist part of it) reacting to the
invasion of Hungary in 1956 with a feeling of betrayal: 'We no longer
believed anyone. Our parents turned out to have been agents and informers,
our military leaders were butchers.'
He still believes in no-one in the former Soviet Union. Professing a
complete lack of illusion in the reform process, he sketches out an
impoverishing, disintegrating and dangerous future for the country of his
birth. The objection that he cannot be president - because of a clause in
the draft constitution (78) which denies that right to anyone who has not
resided in Russia for the past 10 years - is less an indication of
presidential ambition than a view that the current authorities are almost as
scared of those with a moral position as the old ones.
'They are the old apparatchiks in new clothes, after all. They cannot really
change. I have said many times here - to undo the effects of the revolution
you need a revolution, and there has not been one.'
Another sign of the times: 'Oleg Kalugin (a former KGB general turned
publicist) wrote in the Mail on Sunday that he had been instrumental in
developing the poison and the method of killing (Georgy) Markov (the
Bulgarian dissident in exile in London). It was tested on a horse and the
horse died. It was tested on a prisoner and the prisoner did not die.
(Apparently Soviet prisoners are stronger than horses, which did not
surprise me). Now - not a word of regret.
'We are seeing a reaction already, a sluggish reaction at every level of
power as the bureaucrats extend their authority. And the people round
Yeltsin are usually not competent, and terribly provincial. They know
nothing outside of their specialism or their district, nothing.'
He sees salvation nowhere. Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister and now
one of the leaders of the liberal-conservative wing of Russian politics,
achieved little in the way of economic reform because 'he followed shock
therapy, the Polish model of liberating prices, which was all right for
Poland where there was already a large private sector. But (in Russia) it
meant the enterprises simply put up their prices and cut production and
no-one could stop them. They should have been privatised first - so
obvious.'
Yet for the economist and politician (and self-announced contender for the
presidency) whose strategy this is - Grigory Yavlinsky - Bukovsky expresses
more contempt than for 'clever but too bookish' Gaidar. 'Yavlinsky is
nothing but a self-publicist who uses his talent for getting known.' And for
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the main foreign influence on economic reform, the
same strictures.
'All these people were brought up in the old system. They may have read good
things but it would be better had they simply lived in England and had to
pay taxes and buy food and pay the rent. Then they would have felt what a
free market was like.' Bukovsky thinks Boris Fyodorov, the new finance
minister, who spent almost two years in London at the European Bank, may,
for that reason, have a little better grasp, if not much better chance.
Bukovsky, a neurophysicist by training, now makes his money by advising
governments and companies in the former Soviet Union. His advice grows
darker and darker, though he retains energy and wit and has acquired English
self-irony ('the more gloomy the report you write for them the more they pay
you'). His view, stripped down, is that the same fate will befall Russia as
befell the USSR: it will disintegrate, messily, perhaps bloodily, perilously
for the world.
'Look, you must understand that what is happening here is not democracy. It
is the coming to power of the bureaucrat. The dream of the bureaucrat in the
Soviet system was to tell his boss to go to hell. Now he can. Now it is
happening at every level.
'If Moscow cannot control and pay, then the regions and the republics will
break away. Imagine the leaders of the Far Eastern Military District sitting
around one day. One says: 'Are they paying you anything?' The other says:
'No, nothing.' So they say: 'OK, who needs them (in Moscow)?' And so, with
the political leaders, they make a republic. For the people in the far east
it would be very attractive: they could give the Japanese back these four
stupid islands they want (the Kuriles) and get a lot of Japanese help.
'The fact that they are all Russians won't be enough in the face of economic
necessity. This inflation makes it more the case. So you will get them
printing their own money to try to stop the inflation. And if you print your
own money it is only a step to having your own central bank, your own
government, your own country. And if you had a country which bordered on
Yakutia (now called the Republic of Sakwa), which is fabulously wealthy in
diamonds, it would be too much temptation not to send some soldiers in there
and get some of the diamonds for yourself.
'Soon there will be no national services or culture: they will not pay for
them. Even now they cannot pay for communications, railways, roads, and do
you think the rest of the country will continue to support the Bolshoi
(Theatre)?
'Yeltsin cannot keep it together. People think he is strong and decisive
because he acts well in a crisis and he looks tough: actually he cannot take
decisions and compromises all the time. When people were burning their party
cards in the streets it took him months to decide to leave the party.
'Look how he hesitates to take the initiative against the parliament] He has
a fear of being blamed for acting in an authoritarian manner - because of
his past, when he was part of such a system. But no leader from outside that
system would have paused for a moment to do what has to be done.'
He repeats himself. 'This is not a democracy. Norris McWhirter (publisher of
The Guinness Book of Records) once told me what it was. He said there is a
word for Russia. It is a kleptocracy. Everyone steals everything. In a paper
I did for a company, I was hunting for a parallel state to Russia and I
found it: it is Nigeria. All the business is concentrated in the capital,
and it is fantastically corrupt. Yet you cannot say it is not a democracy
sometimes: you cannot say it is not a market economy.'
Bukovsky worked for some part of last year in the archives of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party - opened then to scholars and the curious,
now closed once more. There he found sustenance for his long-held belief
that the CP and the KGB had, especially in the era of detente, gone a long
way to suborning the liberal and left parties of the west.
'It was the old story: the Menshiviks and the Bolsheviks. The Menshiviks
always believed that you could bring them back into the fold, convince them
you don't have to use these terrible methods. These illusions persist.'
The contemporary illusion against which Bukovsky still attempts to tilt is
the western belief that its fear of an imploding Russia can be exorcised by
throwing money at it. 'If there is one thing you should say, it is: don't
give them the money] Don't do it] The west gave billions to Gorbachev and it
is impossible to find a single dollar of it. Where did it go? And this will
go the same way. It will just disappear.'
What is to be done? 'Nothing. Nothing to be done. Maybe in some years the
country will come together again, the various parts will federate. Maybe.
But to stop what is now happening - nothing to be done.'

<TEXT>
I HAD MY final chess lesson yesterday in preparation for the world chess
championship tussle between Britain's Nigel Short and Russia's Garry
Kasparov which starts in London next week. As usual, the lesson was
conducted by Nigel himself, and once again I was accompanied by two friends:
Queen Elizabeth II, head of the House of Windsor, and John Major, prime
minister (just) of Britain.
During these lessons the Queen has emerged as a superb chess strategist who
moves with airy grace through the upper mental atmosphere inhabited by
grandmasters of Nigel's calibre.
But John Major cannot hack it. The man cannot concentrate. He is
superficially competitive, but that is not sufficient. He is easily
befuddled. His play is laborious. He attacks the wrong pieces. Just throws
the game away. We have been most disappointed. But we have endeavoured to be
kind to him because his struggles in the real world - the crises and the
cock-ups, the way people laugh at him - have wrecked his confidence and made
him look haunted.
Yesterday we discussed the finer points of Nigel's own preparation for the
match.
'One has read, Nigel, about your work-outs with your trainer, Mr Kavalek,'
said the Queen, 'and your tireless search for weaknesses in your opponent's
game. So what can we look forward to - what secret moves and stratagems will
you use to slay Kasparov the Barbarian? One is counting on you, Nigel, to
restore some credibility, plus a soupcon of glamour, to one's slightly rocky
reign. One despairs of one's children. One is putting one's faith in you.
You deserve to win, Nigel. And always remember: le fruit du travail est le
plus doux plaisir.'
'Oh, right,' said Nigel. 'Absolutely, yeah. It's really a matter of style,
you know, of trying to steer the game towards a style that suits me, or
steering it towards a style that is uncomfortable for him. Or both at once,
preferably. It's actually quite tricky. But life is treating me good right
now. I am extremely well and happy. I am resisting all distractions. And I
want to kill Kasparov. I really really hate him. He's nothing but a monkey -
those horrible dangling arms and all that revolting chest-hair. He works out
with dumbbells. He can lift his own bodyweight, 80 flipping kilos. God, how
I hate him.'
The Queen rattled with laughter. Her tiara twinkled and shone. But John
Major started to tremble. Greyness suffused his face.
He said: 'I am not sure, Nigel, if you shouldn't try to restrain yourself
and downplay any natural antipathy you might feel towards your opponent. In
my experience most people are perfectly decent sorts once you get to know
them, and there are considerable advantages to be gained from not making
enemies.'
'But he is my enemy,' said Nigel. 'Top-level chess is all about hatred. The
moves are incidental. It's about pulverising your opponent. Stamping on his
face. Making him scream in agony. Watching him twist and squirm and cry out
for mercy as you destroy all his brain cells and smash all his teeth and
chop both his arms off. I'm going to kill that monkey.'
'Nigel,' I murmured. 'You should drop this monkey business. Find some other
insults. The reason I say this is that there is a move afoot in scientific
circles to reclassify the great apes - chimpanzees, orang-utans, gorillas -
as people. People with basic rights. This is because of their extreme
biological closeness to humans and their sophisticated mental abilities.
'They can communicate, you know. Tell a trained female chimpanzee in sign
language that her baby is dead and she will cry, Nigel. Very soon jokes
about apes will be as tasteless as jokes about slavery or' - I searched for
something topical - 'Rupert Murdoch. A few years ago Murdoch looked washed
up. He was teetering on the brink. Now he's OK, though. He's being called a
visionary because of his success in satellite TV.'
The Queen pursed her lips. She abhors the Dirty Digger. John Major was
terrified. He lives in mortal fear of him. But Nigel looked thoughtful. It
is The Times, after all, one of Murdoch's rags, that has raised Pounds 1.7m
in prizemoney for his match against Kasparov.
'All right,' said Nigel grudgingly. 'I'll drop the monkey jokes. But I'm
still going to murder him, the flipping little git.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: The factory Bacchae - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST thing to say about the new Opera Factory version of Euripides'
Bacchae is that it is a 'play with music', just as billed. In the wake of
Henze's Bassarids (libretto by Auden &amp; Kallman) and John Buller's BAKXAI
(mostly in the 'original' ancient Greek - however that may have sounded,
which nobody really knows) at the Coliseum, you might have expected another
opera: not so.
Though the modern Greek architect - mathematician-composer Xenakis has
supplied music for the extensive choruses (in Greek) and some eruptive
orchestral punctuation, David Freeman's show is basically words-and-sights.
The English text, in the poet C K Williams' translation, is crisp and
modern, delivered with brio by the actor-principals. The sights - well, that
is where Freeman's plan becomes problematic.
His programme-note declares The Bacchae 'one of the most savage plays ever
written'. So it is, in a sense, but it is no Titus Andronicus: in ancient
Greek tragedy the visible action is always of the plainest, and violent acts
occur strictly offstage - to be reported later, of course, in scarifying
verbal detail. The reason why the original play is much more discussed now
than performed, despite its appalling, fascinating, suggestively ambiguous
story, is that in practice it is all choral singing and talk.
There are fraught dialogues between Pentheus, the severe young King of
Thebes, and the disguised god Dionysus who comes to draw Theban women
(including the King's mother Agave) away to nameless Bacchic rites on Mount
Kythaeron; and later a fine, agonised scena for Agave, upon learning that
she herself led the frenzied dismembering of her son when he spied upon
their rites in female garb. Yet the guts of the action - rather literally -
remain in decent obscurity. Freeman's solution is to have them vividly
enacted, even while the ghastly facts are narrated.
Partly that works, partly not. Sometimes it marginalises Euripides'
story-telling, which is potent enough on its own; on the other hand, what we
see is inevitably milder than what we're told. Thus, the Bacchantes'
hauling-down of Pentheus from his pine-top vantage is strikingly represented
 -but in desperate flight all his limbs are visibly hale, when we know
already that an arm has been torn from his body.
Gory Grand Guignol would be quite wrong, but the mismatch is distracting
amid Freeman's relentless insistence on raw physical involvement. Again,
when he understandably wanted the trophy that poor, dazed Agave cradles in
her arms - she thinks it a lion's head: it is her son's - to be more than a
papier-mache bust a la Strauss's Salome, he had his Bacchantes bury the rest
of Pentheus's naked, supine body under huge stones first. Balsa-wood they
might be, but among the audience (at least the male half) that operation
probably induced more gut-dismay than Agave's dreadful recognition later.
Still, Veronica Duffy's Agave is brilliantly taut-to-breaking-point, and as
Pentheus Peter Sullivan has all the right youthfully haughty, truculent,
self-righteous vulnerability. Grandfather Cadmus and ancient, near-gaga
Tiresias are sharply captured by Derek Smith and Jerome Willis, with David
Hobbs a staunch Messenger. The variety of Xenakis's choruses, attentive to
Euripides' prosody, is somewhat diminished by unvaried accompaniments -
ritualised, very high and low winds, asymmetrical bursts of percussion,
though the Premiere Ensemble under Nicholas Kok drives them cleanly home.
Dionysus is the dark, towering, muscular Joe Dixon: charismatic, yes, but
hardly the teasingly androgynous ephebe of the play - nor the Stranger of
the King Roger it inspired from Szymanowski, nor of the Henze and Buller
operas. Nevertheless Freeman's production has a rare strength: he gives
equal, dispassionate weight to all the other factors in this extraordinary
piece.
For a 20th-century audience, it ought to have some implicit moral: about the
repression of women, or the impotence of moral authoritarianism, or the
allure of losing oneself in the divinely pre-rational. Every such tidy
thesis is undermined and controverted by the text itself; by the end
everyone loses horribly but Dionysus, who has by then come to seem a
monster. Yet what happens here is simply what happens; if we find it
uncannily disturbing, we have to decide for ourselves why it should be so.
That is a salutary experience.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: Violence for every taste - Videos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCREEN violence, especially for video viewers, has still not gone away even
this late in the year. Is the world winding itself up, we wonder, for the
last years of the century? 1998, one notes with alarm, is the Devil's number
(666) times three; 1999 contains the Devil's number upside down; and 2000
marks a new millennium, with all the devilish apocalypses that that
traditionally entails.
We who have been brought up on Gothic movies are sensitive to such matters.
We look at a video month boasting Bram Stoker's Dracula, Fritz Lang's
reissued M, Leonard Kastle's reissued cult murder film The Honeymoon Killers
and two new but already notorious movies in Man Bites Dog and One False Move
and we sense a pattern. The main motif is a fascination with murder as
compulsion.
Director Francis Coppola in his visually spectacular Bram Stoker's Dracula
(20:20 Vision) gives us the grand old Gothic forebear himself. The Count is
played by Gary Oldman as a helpless predator given to Protean shape-changes,
from an old man in a beetling wig to a young seducer in frockcoat and
Victorian Ray-Bans. This is the killer as chameleon, as much a victim of
nature and cosmic determinism as the lizard that in one guise he
gigantically resembles.
The killers in M (Redemption) and The Honeymoon Killers (Tartan), both in
black-and-white, are more mundane, de-romanticised. Lang's 1931 masterpiece,
based on the story of a true mass murderer, pushes its humdrum psychopath
(Peter Lorre) through a mazy, dim-lit Germany almost palpable with
foreboding. This human insect seems as much a creature of his time as the
banal, deranged suburban couple in The Honeymoon Killers who murder
lonelyheart victims in a sickly America (1969) trapped between the
sentimentality of the Flower Power era and the nightmare of Vietnam.
Today's modern-dress movies of violence are neither romantic a la
Coppola-Stoker nor psycho-sociological like Lang or Kastle. In One False
Move (20:20) the drug-dealing crooks who viciously murder a group of guests
at a party before escaping to cue the film's chase story are self-made
psychos as driven and reasonless as Shakespeare's Iago. And Man Bites Dog
(Tartan) does not finger 'society' as the corrupter of its young anti-hero:
only the man himself as he bounds from one 'snuff' murder to the next,
showing off for his camcorder-wielding friends. Made by Belgian students on
half a shoestring, the film is funny and horrific in equal measure. Even
this year's Hollywood Oscar-sweeper contributes to the 1993 violence
symposium. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (Warner) takes the Western, hangs it
up and thwacks it with a carpet-beater until all the elegiac fluff flies
out. There are no balletic deaths here, no chess-game gunfights. The film
shows how the West was really won. When men die, they do so slowly,
agonizingly, uncomprehendingly. The more bullets the 'hero' spits the more
we see him turn into a grey, implacable, inhuman automaton.
But take comfort: even in Bloody September there are gore-free videos.
Especially recommended: two golden-oldie comedies and one sparkling modern
bio-pic. This last is Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein (Connoisseur): absurdist,
playful, witty in its account of the philosopher and his social and cerebral
frolickings with the Bloomsbury crowd (B. Russell, JM Keynes). The oldies
are both from director Howard Hawks. Only Angels Have Wings (Columbia
TriStar) is Cary Grant, Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth doing what a man (and
two women) gotta do in the tropics while mail aircraft fly and hearts are
broken. And Twentieth Century (Columbia TriStar) has glorious Carole Lombard
and more glorious John Barrymore boarding the titular express to cross
swords and wits for two hours of high - no, highest - Hollywood comedy.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: Old masters in Venice - Nigel Andrews hails films by
Allen, Altman and Scorsese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE all approached the 50th Mostra Del Cinema with mixed feelings. There it
was, shimmering into view, a toast to half a century's conjugal bliss
between art and commerce since Benito Mussolini, that famed benefactor,
founded the world's first film festival in the 1930s.
This year all was not well between Mammon and the Muse. Italy's recent
clean-up has helped to clean out the nation's culture coffers. The Golden
Jubilee was more like a pauper's wedding. Four nights' paid hospitality
maximum for all visitors. No Barbra Streisand on the jury: she wanted too
many first-class air tickets. And such cash as remained, set aside for a
last-week Directors' Symposium involving Scorsese, Spielberg, Altman,
Wenders and other cine-VIPs who do not come cheap.
But nothing more consoles a film critic than fulsome film fare. Thanks
mainly to three films from Hollywood, we have had that. Woody Allen's
Manhattan Murder Mystery is a throwback to the funny Allen of long ago: a
champagne comedy thriller with Woody and Diane Keaton as the New York
married couple sleuthing after a neighbour suspected of wife-murder. The
one-liners are a wonder; the comic pace is near-Olympic; and in spite of
some signs of strain in Allen's own performance - a year of
trial-by-tabloids leaves its mark - a fairminded Venice audience laughed
itself silly. Britain gets the film in the new year.
It gets Robert Altman's Short Cuts and Martin Scorsese's The Age Of
Innocence as soon or sooner. The first is Altman's best since Nashville.
Another fresco of fragments, here adapted from Raymond Carver's astringent
stories of life on the Western seaboard, it finds a prismatic coherence in
the jumble of different stories and emotional colours. Love, murder,
ambition, cookery, sex, fishing, parenthood: Altman creates a majestic,
unforced statement on the passion of little lives trying to tune in to
bigger truths.
Short Cuts boasts the kind of cast few but Altman can assemble, snapping his
fingers like a modern Prospero calling his sprites: Jack Lemmon, Andie
McDowell, Tim Robbins, Lily Tomlin, Robert Downey Jr, Matthew Modine.
Every name still left in the casting directory has been snapped up by
another Grand Old Mage. Martin Scorsese scatters his adaptation of Edith
Wharton's The Age Of Innocence with luminaries from today's movie costume
genre. In 1890s New York Daniel Day-Lewis meets Michelle Pfeiffer and this
new passion tests his betrothal to Winona Ryder.
Wags have called The Age Of Innocence Scorsese's first James Ivory film. You
do wonder at first what the maker of Raging Bull is doing amid this
china-shop decor. (How long before De Niro and Pesci burst through the
French windows with barking machine-guns?) But Scorsese's pictorial flair
brings dazzling new perspectives to period-movie tradition: the overhead
shot that turns a ball into a scorpion dance choreographed by Busby
Berkeley, the card-shuffle of impressionistic images seen through opera
binoculars, the airborne camera-arabesques around banquets or tea parties.
There are still, for me, reservations. The film seems at times an awkward
marriage of kinetic visuals with choked-back performances. Every star is
genteelly strangled with a mid-Atlantic accent; and every star trails clouds
of Pavlovian association with past period-pieces. Many of my colleagues
raved, but until a second viewing I prefer to keep a Whartonesque distance.
An even greater distance is required - positively Jamesian - between the
sane critic and some of the rubbish we have seen at Venice. Liliana Cavani's
Where Are You? I Am Here? is a romance of the aurally challenged: involving
a deaf boy, a deaf girl and a movie audience deafened by sentimental special
pleading. In Carlos Saura's Shoot] a brutally raped circus sharpshooter
fills her assailants full of lead and then spends the remaining story dying
slowly, much like the melodrama-raped film. And in Bertrand Blier's 'comedy'
Un Deux Trois Soleil, the hills above Marseilles are alive - though barely -
with the usual job-lot of wacky outrages and reversals this French director
specialises in: including parent-swapping, group rape and bewildered guest
stars (here Marcello Mastroianni) looking for an exit route.
Though this is a festival where America is trouncing the opposition, one
French film has impressed and one US film has taken a pratfall. Aline
Isserman's L'Ombre Du Doute is a delicately ambiguous story of child abuse,
set as much in the heroine's fantasy-prone mind as in her acidly-etched
family and social milieu. And the American clinker is Even Cowgirls Get The
Blues from Gus Van Sant, the gifted director of My Own Private Idaho. A
bunch of Sapphic cowgirls chewing on 1960s dialogue in a no-address,
no-narrative prairieland holds less charm than the earlier three-way pile-up
of Shakespeare, gay rights and existential comedy.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE ROCK and roll was the medium through which teenagers shocked their
strait-laced parents. But a wasted youth cannot compete in the image market
with the two wasted decades that are part of the legend of Alex Chilton, who
turned up alive on stage in Clapham last week.
Chilton's one brush with popular success came when his band the Box Tops had
a hit with 'The Letter'. Chilton left the Box Tops in the middle of a show.
Back in his home town, Memphis, he joined Big Star.
Big Star are the blueprint cult band: split by internal disputes, alleged
victims of record-company incompetence. Chris Bell, the founder, left after
the first album No 1 Record but may have contributed uncredited to the
second Radio City. Bell's death in a car crash only strengthened the legend.
After the ragged Third, recorded in 1974, released in 1978, Chilton more or
less disappeared. The simplest version of the legend is that he spend two
decades drinking. A talent so hugely squandered, runs rock logic, must be a
huge talent.
The reformed Big Star consists of Chilton, Jody Stephens, the original
drummer, and Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow, members of Seattle band the
Posies, on bass and guitar.
The two Posies looked more like early-70s escapees than Chilton. While he
stood chain-smoking at the side of the stage, they bounced enthusiastically,
tossing their long hair back, a powerful advertisement for regular washing
and conditioning. Chilton readily shared the murky blue and red spotlights.
The two youngsters sung the songs Bell sang. The band displayed all the
virtues of a good American bar band: the playing was tight, enthusiastic and
proficient. Chilton's warm guitar solos were few and brief.
At the root of the Chilton legend is the idea that he is a songwriting
genius. Here were all the fans' favourites. Pop songs with the maddeningly
familiar sound of the hits they never were: 'The Ballad of El Goodo',
'Thirteen' and 'September Gurls' (covered by the Bangles). At its best, the
band played the strongest tunes with muscular conviction, at its worst it
descended into chugging boogie.
The cover versions were revealing (no doubt self-consciously). 'You're
Strange', one of the more obscure works in the T Rex canon, 'Slut' from Todd
Rundgren, master of pop artifice, and a clunking cover of 'Kansas City' from
the rich ersatz rhythm and blues songbook of Lieber and Stoller.
Lou Reed and Iggy Pop can fight over the titles 'godfather of punk' and
'grandfather of grunge', but Chilton, emerging as if from a time warp,
champions a tradition that has largely withered: the clean-cut pop rock of
the Beatles imitators. At times Chilton, the pop singer with a rock and roll
lifestyle, adds a darker shading, a touch of chaos and dissolution colours
his best songs. There were moments in Clapham when the material did justice
to the myth.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: The sun shines on Edinburgh - Edinburgh Festival / Off
the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY festival has its crisis points but perhaps the worst for Brian
MacMaster, supremo at the Edinburgh Festival, was last Tuesday; the sun
shone remorselessly for the first time in months. Looking down on the vast
booking hall at the Festival HQ, where just one punter was buying tickets,
you saw his problem.
Fortunately it would take a heat wave of Saharan proportions to scupper the
financial success of this year's Festival, which ends tonight. The box
office has already taken over Pounds 1.5m, and although its target is Pounds
220,000 higher than last year, it seems certain MacMaster will bring this,
his second Festival as director, safely home within budget.
This is a great achievement. On the international stage Edinburgh is only
matched by Salzburg. It mounts the same number of productions, 170 this
year, and must sell the same number of tickets, 200,000: but Edinburgh lasts
just three weeks, rather than Salzburg's five, and operates on a much
smaller budget of Pounds 4.5m.
Apart from the sudden sunshine the Festival has not been without its other
problems. The mysterious fire which allegedly damaged the back stage at the
Playhouse Theatre undoubtedly hurt the ticket sales of the Canadian Opera,
the only big visitors not to achieve their box office target: which was
ironic since their double bill of Bluebeard's Castle and Erwartung, directed
by Robert Lepage, was perhaps the greatest artistic success of the Festival.
There was also the little matter of three conductors and a leading soprano
crying off at the last moment, and the stranding of the 250 strong cast of
Julius Ceasar in a foreign airport overnight. Then there were the critics,
but MacMaster thinks that productions such as Peter Sellar's The Persians,
which split critics and audiences down the middle, achieved exactly what was
needed by causing controversy. There was less dispute that the Festival's
opening concert, and James MacMillan's new opera Tourist Variations, were
dead in the water, but the dance troupes scored with the audiences.
MacMaster, who gives the impression that if he worries about anything, he
worries internally, has already shifted much of his attention to the 1994
Festival. The only certainties are that Mark Morris will be bringing his
dance company back again to present his ambitiously huge work L'Allegro;
that, after the appearance of Peter Stein's Salzburg Festival production of
Julius Ceasar this year, there will be another joint venture with Salzburg;
and that Scottish Opera will continue to feature in the Festival's plans.
Much still awaits selection. MacMaster was forced to pull a planned opera
from the 1993 lineup just before the programme went to press because its
opening night in Paris was an artistic disaster (which accounts for the
shortage of opera), and in an era when foreign governments can no longer
afford to subsidise visits by their artistic elites a festival director
operates on a much shorter time scale and devotes more time to joint
productions and local talent.
MacMaster faces a daunting new challenge in devising the 1994 Festival. The
completion, at last, of Edinburgh's 'opera house', the Festival Theatre,
next spring, brings problems, along with the largest stage in the UK. It
adds another 1,800 seats to fill nightly, boosting the size of the Festival
by almost 20 per cent. With the Festival's major paymasters, the local and
regional councils, the Scottish Arts Council, and sponsors, unlikely to have
more cash available next year, the hunt is on for new sources of revenue and
ways of boosting ticket sales.
The solution, long mooted, is a co-ordinated international marketing push,
pointing out that for anyone with artistic pretentions, Edinburgh in August
is the only place to be. The Festival, the Fringe, the Television, Film,
Jazz and Book Festivals will all co-operate and help to finance the drive.
MacMaster is also seeking a corporate sponsor to provide cash for the
campaign. Sixty per cent of tickets are sold to outsiders, who bring more
than Pounds 80m into the city.
For too long the mass of artistic events which make the city so exciting for
at least three weeks in the year have worked together in a haphazard way. By
next year such perennial fantasies as one, co-ordinated, marketing
headquarters, even a joint ticket office, or maybe a Festivals Club (the
Palladian building abandoned by the Royal Bank of Scotland in George Street
would be perfect) might have become a reality.
And Edinburgh may gain one more festival. MacMaster denies that he is
antipathetic to the visual arts, but he has resolutely repelled attempts by
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, to get his
marvellous exhibitions, (which this year were devoted to Holbein and Russian
art), attached to the Festival programme. He wants Clifford to organise with
the other visual arts venues to create an autonomous festival to join the
throng. Something needs to be done. The visual arts were particularly strong
this year in Edinburgh. Their contribution should be integrated more
handsomely into this feast of festivals.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: Teuton with a light touch - Edinburgh Festival /
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EDINBURGH Festival has preserved its best theatrical performance for the
end. Heinrich von Kleist's Der Zerbrochne Krug (The Broken Jug) may not be
quite a masterpiece, but it is given a masterly showing by the Deutsches
Theater, Berlin, directed by Thomas Langhoff. The production contains some
of the best light comedy acting I have seen.
Like Jakob Lenz, the other German dramatist featured at the Festival, Kleist
came to a sticky end. He belonged to an old officer family, disliked the
army, left it for the civil service which he liked no better, was spurned by
Goethe, finally ran out of money and entered into a suicide pact with the
wife of an official in Berlin in 1811 when he was only 34.
Most of his life was spent writing: plays, literary theory and journalism.
He was the founder of the first German daily newspaper, the Berliner
Abendblatter.
Of his wit and erudition there can be no doubt. The Broken Jug brings the
two together. On one level it can be seen as a simple comedy about the
wayward course of justice in a village in the Netherlands around the
beginning of the 19th century. Yet, just as pleasing, there are other
dimensions. Two of the principal characters are called Adam and Eve. For the
play is also about the fall from grace and how to get back to it. Moreover,
Adam, the local judge, is based on Falstaff. There is a touch of Dogberry in
the court scenes. Moliere never seems far away and you could say The Broken
Jug is one long Canterbury Tale.
Yet if Kleist drew heavily on past writers, future central European writers
certainly drew on Kleist. If you see The Broken Jug, you will recognise
Kafka as a disciple. There is also plenty of Kleist's legacy in the lighter
side of Brecht.
The truly wonderful aspect of the play and the production, is the lightness
of touch. Yesterday I criticised Peter Stein's production of Julius Caesar
for its Teutonic heaviness. Today it gives me great pleasure to report what
I always knew: namely, that the Germans are not always like that.
The play is good without being exceptionally so, though it does have some
clever twists, especially at the end when it becomes clear that the search
for justice over who broke the jug will go on to a higher court. But if
there is skill in the storytelling, the great virtue is in writing parts for
actors. Even the smallest characters have their moments, and know how to
take them. There are maids almost without speaking parts: Langhoff lets them
shine as they pass through with an axe to cut the logs, or sometimes with
chicken feathers in their hair.
Of the larger parts, watch (it is impossible not to) Gudrun Ritter as Frau
Martha, the woman whose jug was broken and persists in her complaint. You
will be riveted by the others as well, but the crowning triumph belongs to
Langhoff who resists the temptation to turn the visiting magistrate into an
over-heavy bureaucrat. Other German directors would have made him an
incipient Nazi. Here, as played by Klaus Piontek, he is ultimately a kindly
figure who mellows when offered wine, recognises the origin and the vintage
and never loses a sense of fairness. This is a very humane play.

EVERYTHING about this story is true, and all of it is quintessentially
Fringe.
You go to a lunchtime show on Monday at the Assembly Rooms. It turns out not
to be happening that day, because its cast has the day off on Monday. So you
squat on some steps and use the time to work out your itinerary. Two eager
guys from Alaska stop and ask your advice about what to see. A fatigued
Scottish journalist comes up and urges you to see a show which is closing
tomorrow. He does not know if he likes it or not, but he thinks it is kind
of interesting, and he wants to know what you think. It is called Soiree, it
is at the Demarco Gallery (where you have never been), he tells you that the
'phone number listed in the official brochure is wrong.
You ring the number he gives you. it is wrong, you use directory enquiries,
you get the right number, the Demarco people tell you when the show is on.
You rearrange your itinerary some more, you ring the Demarco, you ask for a
seat for the lunchtime show tomorrow. Mr Demarco himself (for it is he)
tells you that he will endeavour to squeeze you in.
The next day, you arrive at the Demarco three minutes late, because you have
been held up by an overlong morning concert. The guy at the box office tells
you that you might just be in time. This actually means that everything is
running 15 minutes late and you have to wait 10 minutes in a chilly
corridor. People pass the time by talking about Susan Sontag choosing to
direct Waiting for Godot in Sarajevo. The woman who joins the queue after
you looks radiant and cries 'This place must have the best food in
Edinburgh]' You do not have time for food. No-one near you knows anything
about Soiree. By the time you get in there are no programmes, if there ever
were any.
Soiree turns out to be one of those sick-soul-of-Europe studies in
decadence, but it is also an unusual piece of wordless dance / movement
theatre. It lasts just over an hour, it has three performers, and what makes
it amazing is the first woman to appear. Strange, attractive, and kooky, she
enters, with her back to us, sideways, slowly (like the Dying Swan). Dressed
in an 18th-century gown, barefoot, she shuffles along in a series of varied
tiny steps, a kind of baroque boogie that sends ripples upwards through her
thighs and her crinoline.
When she turns round, it is as if the little sister from Chandler's The Big
Sleep had wandered into Les Liaisons Dangereuses. She has long fair hair,
bee-stung cherry lips, and smoky blue eyes (with heavily charcoaled lashes)
that look tear-laden and seldom focus on anything you can identify. Her neck
droops, her spine droops in a swan-like S-bend, she might be sleepwalking,
or drugged, or a nymphomaniac, and everything she does is utterly riveting.
Soiree seems really to be about the horrid, voluptuous masochism of decadent
petty souls. The three performers waste time elegantly and pointlessly, they
indulge themselves idly, they build up obsessions and tensions over no good
cause. It is the fair-haired girl who makes all this important. Towards the
end of the work, she advances towards the male performer she plants an
extended foot on his neck and then, calmly, she falls slowly backwards on to
the floor; where she opens her legs, and then starts to pound his chest with
her feet. Soiree is slightly longer than it needs to be, its taped score
(made up of repetitious mini-cycles of sound) is faintly maddening, nothing
about its choreography is radically original, but its best features are
haunting.
Afterwards, a dozen of you ask for programmes. You are asked to wait five
minutes. Mr Demarco leads you all into his office. He tells you all that
Soiree is the best thing at the '93 festival, that he only presents truly
original work, that he would not present Mark Morris doing the same old
thing, that Soiree should have won a Fringe First (here you agree), and that
he wants to present it in Sarajevo. Impressed though you were by Soiree, you
think that Sarajevo needs it even less than it needs Sontag. You ask Mr
Demarco just what he thinks Morris's 'same old thing' is. He does not reply.
He says he is also presenting Medea at 9 pm in the open air that night.
When he is not talking, you find some information that says Soiree was
presented by the Yvette Bosnik Company from Hungary. You wonder if Bosnik
was the fair one. At this point, the fair one and the other female performer
enter Demarco's office. There are five men in their dressing room, they say,
who will not leave; they will not change until the five men are evicted.
Demarco hastens to sort out this crisis, and you beat it before they call
the police.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: A worthy Falstaff - Edinburgh Festival / Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL big offering of this year's musical and operatic programme at
Edinburgh provides one of the undoubted climaxes of an otherwise not
especially climax-notable festival season. It is Falstaff, the last Verdi
opera, which therefore supplies a peculiarly appropriate 'last movement' to
a festival that had Verdi as one of its thematic strands, and that earlier
had billed (in concert form) the very first Verdi opera, Oberto.
Since Falstaff arrives at the Playhouse in a revival of the 1988 production
that Peter Stein made for Welsh National Opera, there is an added thematic
appropriateness to the offering. Stein has figured as one of the four
international-heavyweight theatre directors to be spotlighted here this year
(Malcolm Rutherford wrote in yesterday's paper of his Salzburg staging of
Julius Caesar in its Edinburgh transplantation).
This response to Verdi's 'miracle of grace, generosity, confidence, fine
working, and marvellous invention' (Andrew Porter's phrase in an Edinburgh
programme-book essay) has all those qualities: it explains why Stein is
worth the fuss people have the past two decades been making over his work.
There should perhaps be one caveat. Although the revival comes up unstaled,
its working is not always fine without qualification: pauses for
scene-change take too long, and the relative clumsiness of the Windsor
Forest setting is still unimproved.
But the ensemble exuberance and ripe physicality of characterisation remain
irresistible. Above all, this refers to Donald Maxwell's Falstaff, who
glories in his girth with animal spirits even more untamed than five years
ago; but it also concerns the sheer 'go' of WNO's female quartet. This opera
treats many themes in its survey of human affections; one of them is the
eternal stupidity of men and the no-less-eternal forgivingness of women, a
theme handled by Stein with sharper point than in any other Falstaff I know.
The leader of the quartet, as in 1988, is Suzanne Murphy, witty, plucky and
altogether adorable as Alice Ford in spite of an announced cold. Other
well-remembered performances include Nuccia Focile's spicy Nannetta, and the
Caius, Bardolph and Pistol of Peter Bronder, John Harris and Geoffrey Moses.
The newcomers lend fresh lustre: Claire Powell's unusually youthful,
sensuous Quickly, Paul Charles Clarke's sweet-toned Fention, above all Bryn
Terfel as a Ford of dark magnificence.
In this (for Falstaff) huge theatre the shine tends to rub off the
orchestral sound. That said, the conducting of Richard Armstrong, WNO's
former chief, displays mastery still more substantial than in 1988: the
opera is taken steadily, with care for verbal clarity and meaning but with
no sacrifice of comic zest. Only one more Edinburgh Falstaff (tonight), then
the revival forms part of WNO's autumn repertory, and can thus be more
widely enjoyed.
An interesting point of comparison was suggested by the Edinburgh Verdi
conducting of Armstrong's WNO successor, Carlo Rizzi. In an Usher Hall
Requiem last weekend, given by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the
Edinburgh Festival Chorus (solid, well-schooled, strangely un-thrilling),
Rizzi's italianate vitality was sometimes exhilarating, and sometimes
hotheadedly immature in effect. Of the soloists it was the mezzo, Olga
Borodina, who with grave richness of tone most consistently sustained
'festival standard'; Jane Eaglen, the soprano, was splendidly powerful in
loud phrases, a shade below pitch in soft.
Falstaff is sponsored by Bank of Scotland, Requiem by Scottish Power

FT  04 SEP 93 / Collecting: In the Cotswolds, the buying is easy - An area
of rare charm where antique hunters can find almost anything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUICK foray recently into this most bucolic of regions to test the
temperature of the antique trade produced a fairly consistent response. Most
dealers are happier with business than they were a year ago, when trade was
negligible, but there is no consistency to the revival.
A few excellent weeks can be followed by a dead period. One day, that almost
extinct species, the American dealer, turns up and walks out with Pounds
10,000 worth of goods; then, for the rest of the week, the only visitors are
coach parties of OAPs sheltering from the rain. One dealer reports that
turnover is up by 50 per cent in the first half of the year while another
struggles on, taking Pounds 100 a week on a shop that costs Pounds 1,000 a
week to keep open.
At least most of the serious dealers have survived. Few have thrown in the
towel in the past year and most agree that, while sales are increasing only
slowly, there has been a considerable rise in enquiries. Experience suggests
that many of those potential buyers, ruminating over a photograph of a
Georgian dresser or a Victorian desk, will eventually take the purchasing
plunge.
The Cotswolds offers the biggest concentration of antique dealers outside
London. Within a few pleasant miles, well over 100 present antiques which
often approach the best of the capital in quality - and, equally, often seem
to carry lower price tags.
This could be because Cotswold dealers operate on lower overheads and have
not such a commercial approach to the game. They enjoy living in the area,
and trading in antiques offers a wonderful excuse for an attractive life
style.
Not that they are unprofessional. Traditionally, the Cotswolds was the great
clearing house of the British antiques world, the place where runners -
those sharp-nosed individuals who grab a living buying antiques cheaply at
obscure auctions or from small dealers, and then pass them up through the
trade - called in regularly to sell, while the London, American and
continental dealers made frequent visits to acquire stock.
Today, the Cotswold dealers sell much less to the trade, which is suffering
badly from recession - and the restraints of bank managers - and is not in a
buying mood. Instead, private collectors have become the main customers.
They are also becoming more demanding. To make a sale these days, dealers
must ensure that their goods are repaired and polished to perfect condition.
They must also be prepared to let the customer try out the item in their
home; offer payments by instalment; consider taking antiques in part
exchange; provide free delivery; and often guarantee to take the object back
any time in the future at the sale price.
All these services - added to the fact that prices have, at best, held
steady over the past year and, for lower quality antiques, have actually
fallen - mean it is an excellent time to buy. Some dealers are becoming more
like interior decorators, working for a group of regular clients with a home
to furnish, or a hotel to refurbish, seeking out a specific type of antique
to fit a specific slot.
One dealer gets by with half a dozen loyal private customers; another works
mainly with American interior decorators. A great deal of business is now
done through sending photographs of choice items to buyers who might be
interested. This saves both time and money.
It is one of the ironies of the Cotswold life that while August sees the
small, picturesque towns like Stow, Cirencester, Broadway and Burford awash
with tourists, it is the quietest selling month of the year. Very
occasionally, a tourist, usually from the Continent, makes a big purchase,
but most of the passing trade is looking, at most, for a holiday memento
costing Pounds 100 or less.
With business at base relatively quiet, the Cotswold dealers are more likely
to be found at fairs. One leading dealer, Duncan Baggott of Stow, tried his
first-ever fair, the BADA at the Duke of York's, in May and, like many
fair-goers, found the main benefit was in later enquiries back at the shop.
John Noot of Broadway is the epitome of the modern dealer in concentrating
on fairs and giving up his prime retail site. He reckons he can take space
in 10 good fairs for the annual cost of his former high street outlet's
overheads, and do more business. He has kept a small space in the town but
his main stock of decorative paintings is on show at his new home, a manor
house on the outskirts of Broadway.
Like all dealers, Noot says the main problem at the moment is a scarcity of
good objects to buy. Only in extremis are owners disposing of worth-while
antiques at this time of low prices: they are waiting for an upturn. Even
the cash flow problems of Lloyd's Names have failed to unleash many fine
objects; and although some Cotswold dealers have lost the custom of
beleagured Names, Lloyd's has not yet proved a major obstacle to recovery.
If the house market, and the opportunities for refurbishing, continue to
improve; if the rising stock exchange index increases disposable incomes;
if, above all, the antique buying classes feel more confident about the
economic future - then, the tentative recovery of the past six months will
turn into a firmly based revival.
No one should be shy of entering the shop of a Cotswold dealer; in a
concentrated area, there is a wealth of choice. Most carry some low priced
items and most will be prepared to consider an offer below the labelled
price (although some consider this boorish behaviour on the part of a
customer at a time when profit margins can be as low as 20 per cent). In the
Cotswolds, you can choose between dozens of 18th century tables; Regency
bookcases; Gothic chests; country dressers; and decorative clocks, pots, and
pewter. Yet, there is individuality within the variety.
Take Stow, which has more than 30 dealers of varying importance. Baggott has
one of the largest stocks in the region, with more than 5,000 items for
sale, the great majority priced below Pounds 20,000. He used to concentrate
on supplying the trade but now the public is his best customer. They want
useful objects, like chairs and chests, preferably costing less than Pounds
10,000.
Baggott stocks everything in his two Stow retail outlets, from Chippendale
bookcases, to a Gillow desk of 1884, to a board showing the rules for the
servants' hall at Woburn in 1793, to glass walking sticks.
Next door on one side is Huntington Antiques, which has one of the best
stocks of early - up to Queen Anne - furniture in the UK. This is the place
for an early-16th century Flemish pulpit, once in the Cloisters Museum in
New York; or a 13th century Limoges enamel book cover priced at Pounds
75,000; or a Charles II tester bed.
On the other side is John Davies, one of the few specialist picture dealers
trading in the Cotswolds. They have been hit hardest by the recession
(wrongly or rightly, buyers feel they can live without more pictures while
still needing tables and chairs), but Davies has responded by moving into
the 20th century, and modern, period.
Across the way, Antony Preston tried trading from the King's Road in London
recently but he prefers Stow for his distinctive Regency and First Empire
furniture and decorative objects. And around the corner is Christopher
Clarke, who always carries eclectic rarities like 18th century fire screens,
Venetian busts, and 19th century American door-stops in the shape of a boot.
The great rival to Stow in terms of shops is Burford. Once again, the
variety is astonishing. Manfred Schotten is one of the few Cotswolds
specialists, being a leading dealer in sporting antiques. Here, you can buy
an early 20th century golf club for Pounds 20 or an acclaimed Tom Morris
club of the mid-19th century for Pounds 3,000; an old croquet set for Pounds
400; and an Eton boater of the 1890s for Pounds 220. Anyone bored with 18th
century brown furniture will be refreshed by the Schotten stock.
Actually, one of the attractions of the Cotswolds is that it is not
over-burdened with sedate, refined, Georgian pieces. Swan Antiques deals in
early country furniture, and proprietor Dominic Pratt seems positively to
enjoy bargaining over his modestly priced stock.
Here, you might buy a William and Mary Bible Box for Pounds 700; a 1790s'
bidet with its original, decorated receptacle, for Pounds 500; a Queen Anne
dresser for around Pounds 4,500; and a 10 ft-long late-Georgian table for
just over Pounds 4,000. Pratt likes to turn over his stock quickly, and
still gets calls from the families of Irish tinkers who roam the land
smelling out antiques of variable quality.
Down the way from Swan, David Pickup sells an unusual range of items, from
late-19th century arts and crafts furniture, preferably by named makers, to
early-19th century items like an 1822 table, one of the first to be created
in the Elizabethan revival style (Pounds 16,000).
Across Burford High Street is Robin Shield. Among the many off-beat items in
his stock is a large refractory glass on a bronze stand, dating from around
1730. It is the largest of its kind to surface and probably was used for
scientific experiments. Now, it will delight interior decorators.
On the edge of Burford is Gateway Antiques, a great barn of a place with a
bewildering stock of modestly priced antiques. The owners, Paul Brown and
Michael Ford, spend much of their time on the road acquiring hundreds of
pieces which they aim to turn over quickly at a modest profit. Prices rarely
exceed Pounds 5,000. The choice is vast, and it is not just Victorian repro
chests or Georgian commmodes. Gateway culls 15 auctions a week for
interesting stock.
A few miles away, Witney Antiques is a complete contast. In the upstairs
gallery at Gateway, you can buy 1950s' tables for Pounds 200 or less. At
Witney, you get classic Georgian furniture of Bond Street quality. The
prices bring you down to earth, but every piece is presented meticulously
and shouts class.
In stock at present is an ivory-veneered bureau bookcase with silver mounts
made in India late in the 18th century for the likes of Robert Clive; a
cabinet completed in China and priced at Pounds 10,000; and any number of
gleaming Georgian bureaux and chairs. Witney Antiques has long considered
moving to London but it has prospered for almost 30 years at the entrance to
the Cotswolds and is a regular first stop for overseas dealers and serious
collectors.
Twenty miles away, on the northern edge of the Cotswolds, is Broadway. Here,
perhaps the longest established dealer operates from a row of Tudor mansions
in the High Street.
In its day, HW Keil was a regular port of call for the rich Americans who
disembarked from their transatlantic liner at Southampton in the 1930s and
arrived in London via the Cotswolds. The Queen Mother, when Duchess of York,
was a Keil customer.
Some of the items in the vast stock carry a silver star, which means they
are not for sale because they could no longer be replaced. They include a
15th century food cabinet, although you can buy a sedan chair. Keil is a
step back into the past, with antiques ranging from Georgian to the oldest
and rarest.
A bonus from antique hunting in the Cotswolds is that you get to visit some
attractive towns and villages. Cirencester might not get the coach parties
that throng Broadway and Stow, but it has a composed charm. It also has some
good antique shops, notably William Stokes, yet another dealer trading in
early furniture who is adept at stocking a 16th century farm house or a 17th
century manor house with period furniture.
Along the way, too, is Rankin Taylor, which specialises in rarities as well
as antiques that strike the fancy of its proprietor, Leslie Taylor. At
present, these include some late-17th century sculpted heads, created in the
fledgling New England, to some 19th century port bottles which convert into
excellent decanters.
Some of the Cotswold towns, notably Stow and Burford, seem to be given over
entirely to antique shops. But there are also important stopping places in
smaller villages like Winchcombe, Taddington, Tetbury and Fairford, where
Richard and Scilla Chester-Master go in for His and Her shops, His features
traditional Georgian mahogany; Hers has French country furniture and
faience. Alongside each other, they sum up the range and charm of what the
Cotswolds can offer.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Arts: Enjoy an opera or ballet for only Pounds 10 - The new
ROH season's programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUR NAME has come up and you are guaranteed the best available seat, (at
the time you are contacted), at Covent Garden for just Pounds 10 - how great
a bargain is it, and are you likely to have an exhilarating experience?
Yes and Yes. Most of the seats up for offer under the scheme are likely to
be good ones, often the orchestra stalls which for opera can go for up to
Pounds 100, or more. So there is little doubt that they represent remarkable
value for the money.
But you are also likely to enjoy yourself immensely. Not only is the Royal
Opera House one of the grandest and most awesome theatres in the land, but
Covent Garden is currently enjoying an artistic renaissance. Last season it
swept the board in the prize-giving ceremonies for the best opera and ballet
performances in London, and the programme devised by general director Jeremy
Isaacs for 1993-94 is particularly exciting, especially for opera.
The opera schedule is a mixture of popular favourites, designed to ensure a
good box office take in difficult economic times, and intriguing new
productions. There are seven new productions, which seem destined to get the
critics scribbling furiously.
The first to enter the programme, on October 8, is the first new Covent
Garden production in decades of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg,
with its intense personal dramas and rousing choruses. It promises to be a
stylish show, set firmly in the Germany of the late medieval period and with
popular local favourite Thomas Allen, and perhaps the world's leading
Wagnerian bass baritone John Tomlinson, in leading roles. Covent Garden's
music director Bernard Haitink conducts the work for the first time. The
Mastersinger, Wagner's celebration of the power of music, should be a
highlight.
The new Die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute) is very colourful, with many fresh
young singers, and was well received when first seen in Glasgow last year.
If this is one of the most popular and frequently performed of operas, the
next new production, Cherubin, by the late 19th century composer Massenet,
is a great rarity. It tells what happened to the lovesick Cherubino after he
was sent to the wars in Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. It is light and
charming and has a young cast under the baton of the Russian conductor
Gennady Rozhdestvensky, a rare visitor to Covent Garden. The new Katya
Kabanova is directed by Trevor Nunn, conducted by Haitink, and has an
undoubted star, Elena Prokina, singing the title role. This is dramatic,
compelling opera by Janacek which has become popular in recent years. In
contrast Giordano's Fedora is almost unknown and was last staged at Covent
Garden in 1925. It is a tragic love story and has a suitably romantic
leading tenor in Jose Carreras.
The other two new opera productions are by Italian masters, Rossini's Mose
in Egitto, a rare dramatic opera by this most melodic of composers, and
Verdi's ever-popular Aida. Amazingly, Aida has not been performed at Covent
Garden since 1984 and we are promised a spectacular and undoubtedly rousing
production.
While the new productions grab the headlines, there are plenty of delights
in the revivals. There is a return of the elegant 1950s production of
Puccini's Madama Butterfly, with Diana Soviero making her debut in the role
at Covent Garden as the tragic Cio-Cio-San. There is a lively, colourful,
L'Italiana in Algeri, with firm favourite Marilyn Horne making perhaps her
last Covent Garden appearance in the title role. There is a speedy revival
for Mozart's Mitridate, Re di Ponto, which he wrote when he was only 14, and
which won the 1992 Olivier Award for the Most Outstanding Achievement of the
Year in Opera. There is Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, which opened last
season to mixed reviews for the production but which is promised another
outstanding cast. There are those old standbys, Tosca, Rigoletto and Carmen,
which can hardly fail, a dramatic Elektra, and Un ballo in maschera which
brings back to Covent Garden the popular conductor Daniel Gatti. The only
contemporary work in the canon is Harrison Birtwistle's Gawain, which was
either loved or loathed on its 1991 unveiling. It has been shortened, but
contains many dazzling effects, not least the beheading of the mysterious
Green Knight.
Many will take up our special offer just for the outside chance of seeing
one of the greatest tenors of our generation for a tenner. Placido Domingo
will appear as Don Jose for four performances in Carmen, and there is the
most outside of outside chances that you may get a ticket. If you miss
Domingo you might be watching one of his successors in Le Nozze di Figaro
(The Marriage of Figaro), which stars Bryn Terfel, the highly acclaimed
young Welsh baritone, making his Covent Garden debut as the scheming Figaro.
Throw in the lush Manon, Gwyneth Jones in La fanciulla del west, and a visit
from Opera North with that oddball, Benjamin Britten's Gloriana, composed
for the Queen's Coronation in 1953, and you have in prospect one of the most
intriguing Covent Garden seasons in recent years.
It is hard to pretend that the 1993-94 dance season at the Royal Opera House
offers such potential excitements. The Royal Ballet is building up its
strength and its only new full-length production this season opens in
Washington. But there are many intriguing performances in prospect. The
opening programme offers four short ballets (two of which are world
premieres) and finds The Royal Ballet dancing in contemporary style but on
points. Two of the new works are choreographed by Matthew Hart and William
Tuckett, both dancers with The Royal Ballet.
Then comes the quintessential ballet, Romeo and Juliet, with Darcey Bussell
expected to make her debut in the role as one of the three Juliets on offer.
The run up to Christmas brings back two popular seasonal favourites. Tales
of Beatrix Potter charmed many last season (if not all the critics), and
there is a welcome long run of Nutcrackers. This is followed by another
great dramatic ballet, Kenneth MacMillan's Mayerling. The only other
full-length ballet in the season is Don Quixote, which the public loved and
the critics gave the thumbs down to. Once again Darcy Bussell is pledged to
appear, along with Sylvie Guillem and Viviana Durante.
At the end of the season The Birmingham Royal Ballet makes its annual
appearance at Covent Garden with the London premiere of David Bintley's new
work, Sylvia, and then an intriguing triple bill of Balanchine's Serenade; a
new production, Fall River Legend, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, and the
ever-popular Elite Syncopations.
It is hard to believe that anyone receiving a ticket for any of these
occasions will consider that their tenner has been squandered.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Books: The King recalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY CAME SUDDENLY by Francis King
Constable Pounds 16.95, 336 pages
FRANCIS KING wrote To The Dark Tower when he was 23. Now, at 70 not out and
30 or so novels later, he is hard at work on a new one. In between there
have one or two books of short stories, hundreds of reviews, and the odd
biography. A 'prolific writer' is what King calls himself in this book of
memoirs, Yesterday Came Suddenly, and that seems absolutely right. Like
Justice Shallow, whom he resembles in no other respect, King is 'an early
stirrer'. He tells us that it is his custom to rise at 5 or 6am whatever the
time of year and write for a couple of hours before breakfast, and then
perhaps four more during the day.
His industry is legendary. Before she took up the law, the late Anita Ryan
QC was a colleague of King's at the British Council in Florence. She had an
abiding memory of King in the half-hour break between classes repairing to
the staff common-room, brushing aside offers of coffee, impervious to
chatting groups, as he sat apart at a table to work at his next novel before
resuming work for the Council.
The story of this entertaining book is that, industrious as he was, writing
novels could not in King's case become a full-time job until recently. It
had to be combined with such chores as running the Council office in Kyoto,
a seven-year stint as drama critic of the Sunday Telegraph, and the honorary
occupation of presiding over International PEN.
He also describes himself as being very sociable, and here again one cannot
quarrel with his choice of epithet. No-one can have made more friends and
kept more of them; many were fellow-writers, people such as Ivy
Compton-Burnett, Olivia Manning, J R Ackerley, Robert Liddell, Elizabeth
Taylor. King has had lasting friendships with all of these as he has with
many less eminent authors. He has a revealing anecdote or two about them
all, never outrightly malicious but usually wildly indiscreet (eg Ackerley
peeing on the sheets and the dog getting blamed). There are many other
friends in different walks of life who throng these pages about whom King
has witty, tender and insightful things to say .
I confess that I too have been a friend of King's for almost 50 years; ever
since we met at Oxford just after the war. Why then are you reviewing his
book? you may ask. Well, partly because I could not resist reviewing it and
partly because King is not a man who pulls any punches about his friends'
work; nor would he wish me to pull any punches when reviewing his.
The book reproduces the author's conversational manner, his riveting way of
describing those extraordinary occurrences or coincidences that are
constantly befalling him. Its weakness is that though it follows a
chronological path from childhood in India to middle age and third age in
Kensington, it lacks a firm structure and tends to rattle on until you
become almost sated with anecdotes. But to anyone who has read his novels it
fills many gaps in one's knowledge of the author.
His regular readers know, for instance, that he was born in Switzerland and
partly brought up in India, where his father was a British officer in the
police; India under the Raj was the setting for his novel Acts of Darkness.
Now we have the full account of his uncle's murder and his father's death
from the then incurable TB, the family's desolation, King's life in England
as a 'remittance child", his relations with his remarkable mother, who lived
to be more than 100 and who inspired his novel The Widow (the one book of
his she disliked), his schoolboy career at Shrewsbury where he was happy in
spite of brutalities, his time at Oxford broken by the war, not in his case
by military service but by farm-work. (He was a conscientious objector; he
gives his past reasoning and present views).
As a post-war undergraduate, with one novel published and poetry in The
Listener, King, I recall, was aloof from undergraduate society. He seemed
glad to go down and delighted to be appointed to a British Council job,
first in Italy, then in Greece, Finland, Egypt and Japan. He was one of
several writers employed at that time by the Council - Louis Macneice,
Ronald Bottrall, D J Enright, James Kirkup - all of whom King remembers.
Other colleagues included Francis Toye, the musicologist, and Roger Hinks,
the diarist. King was a diligent worker for the Council and rose to become a
director. He reveals that this was combined with a very full private life.
His accounts of his and other peoples' mainly homosexual amours are a
hilarious replacement for the usual descriptive and cultural digressions in
a book about countries where the author lived in happy, working exile. King
took early retirement and resided for many years in Brighton - see The
Brighton Belle and other stories - before coming back to London. It was in
Brighton that he found himself involved in a prolonged and costly libel
action started by a neighbour (see The Action) and Brighton where he met the
love of his life, a man he first encountered through putting an
advertisement in the local paper, requesting information about the work of a
deck-chair attendant, for the purposes of a novel.
The last chapter describes how after their many years of happiness as a
couple his lover died of Aids, and King himself afterwards underwent an
operation for cancer. The mood changes here to molto adagio after the long
joyous allegro of the middle section.
'I have often said' - King concludes - 'that I am never happier than when I
am writing. That is true. But it might have been better for me and for those
close to me if it had not been so.' Where is the writer who could not
similarly reproach him or herself? But none, surely, with less justice.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Books: Critical outsider who thrived on support - A fine
biography highlights the still unresolved contradictions of a brilliant
political theorist

HAROLD LASKI: A LIFE ON THE LEFT by Isaac Kramnick and Barry Sheerman Hamish
Hamilton Pounds 25
HAROLD LASKI'S life is fascinating and instructive. He found it so
fascinating that he was given to telling stories, sometimes tall stories,
about his relations with the famous and powerful. We know that Francis
Galton, the eugenicist, found him brilliant, as did Oliver Wendell Holmes,
who treated him like a son and whose friend and confidant he became. He was
close to Justices Frankfurter and Brandeis and to countless other left and
liberal luminaries on both sides of the Atlantic, and also in Europe (the
authors tell us too little about his relations with these). In Britain he
moved to centre stage as Chairman of the Labour Party after the war, by
which time he seemed to know almost everybody.
One of the subsidiary pleasures of this superb biography is the detective
work the authors have done in sifting fact from fiction. He did, from his
childhood in Manchester, know Churchill, whom his wealthy businessman father
had supported in his resolute stand against anti-semitism. He did, as an
Oxford student, have a blazing row with Lloyd George about women's suffrage.
And he was a frequent correspondent with Franklin Roosevelt, who enjoyed his
company. The authors have unearthed a story Laski was careful never to tell:
his abortive attempt, while at Oxford, to blow up Oxted railway station in
support of the suffragettes.
They conclude in his favour: his romancing was only an exaggeration of an
extraordinarily successful strategy, pursued throughout his life, of being
the critical outsider while 'thriving on the company, support and applause
of the very people one has mocked, satirized and sought to topple'. They
plausibly suggest that the marginality and alienation of his status as a
radical Jewish intellectual in Britain lent that strategy its peculiar
intensity.
What is fascinating is how to account for its exceptional success. For he
did not only impress the Establishment. He became 'a mass preacher and
public teacher, one of the most widely read and listened-to public
intellectuals of this century  .. more interested in teaching people about
and ushering in socialism than in his scholarly or political reputation.'
He was, on all accounts, 'brilliant': articulate, witty, knowledgeable, with
a sense of fun and an easy accessibility. He was an outstanding, magnetic
teacher, whose influence radiated from the LSE throughout the Third World. A
political theorist with an early taste for pluralism and syndicalism, who
became a statist Fabian and eventually a Marxist of sorts, it was not,
however, because of his ideas that he made friends and influenced so many
people.
On the contrary: he was not an originator but rather an indefatigable
synthesiser on the hoof of prevailing grand ideas that seemed to provide
justifications and scenarios of radical change while protecting the
intellectual freedom that made his style of radicalism possible. Hence his
extraordinary eclecticism that leads the authors, rather kindly, to suggest
that his thought had many 'layers'.
In fact, it was riddled with contradictions. He believed that capitalism was
outmoded and doomed but that the ruling class could be won over by reason,
and that revolution by violence could be averted through revolution by
consent. He also believed the powerful would resist the advent of a militant
socialism whose absence he never ceased to lament.
He thought the State was irredeemably partisan and potentially neutral and
that the Labour Party was a force for socialist transformation and
hopelessly reformist and trade union-dominated. He was 'fiercely egalitarian
and yet an intellectual prone to elitism and cultural snobbery'. He was
ambivalent about the United States, loving it and fiercely criticising it,
and, more seriously, about Soviet Russia, acutely attacking the Webbs'
adulation of it, but subsequently seeing in it the harbinger of a new
civilisation.
He was 'a cosmopolitan rationalist and a cultural, ultimately Zionist, Jew'.
Perhaps one key to his extraordinary appeal in his day was the prospect that
so well-informed and brilliant a mind could find a way to resolve the
contradictions he so clearly exhibited.
Yet the story is not only absorbing. It is also revelatory of what a 'life
on the left' can no longer be. Laski's life is, in a way, a parable of what
we have irretrievably lost. For the contradictions it so amply contained no
longer excite the optimism that they can be overcome. Above all, we we have
lost the possibility of assuming that 'socialism' names a socio-economic and
political order that is feasible and viable and more efficient than and
morally superior to capitalism.
Without that assumption, a life on the left today must face questions that
Laski's style of thought always avoided: how to make capitalism work for the
benefit of the least advantaged, the vulnerable and the excluded; how to
tame the destructive effects of markets; how to attain more social justice
in face of the declining reach of the state.

   By ZARA STEINER

<TEXT>
CODEBREAKERS edited by F H Hinsley and Alan Stripp Oxford Pounds 17.95, 321
pages
ULTRA was the British success story of the Second World War. The ability of
British codebreakers to read and interpret enemy signals gave the Allies a
decisive advantage that shortened the European war. The story has been told
in the magisterial multi-volume account produced earlier by FH Hinsley and
his team, an essential and unique source book for every war student, writes
Zara Steiner.
This collection of recollections by the men and women who worked at
Bletchley Park, an ugly Edwardian mansion with its adjacent 'huts' which was
the centre of Britain's wartime codebreaking activities, is a more informal
effort to recall and recreate the atmosphere of the times and to give an
authentic picture of the work done by an unusual assortment of individuals,
many recruited through the 'old boys' network at Cambridge and Oxford and
some straight from school. Among the first contingent of 30 recruits who
joined the small group of regular intelligence officers were mathematicians,
classicists, historians and linguists, most strangers to the arcane
mysteries of code and cipher-breaking and knowing nothing about the services
they came to serve.
For many readers, the most interesting parts of these individual memoirs are
the accounts of recruitment - mathematicians calling on old friends and
fellow scholars, a brief interview with a tutor or professor, 'probing my
interest in the three Cs - classics, chess and crosswords' - and the
evocations of the wartime atmosphere at Bletchley Park. Only one essayist
speaks of positive vetting: there was little time or need for such
investigations. Even when the Bletchley Park group grew from under 100 in
1939 to more than 4,000 in 1944, the secret was kept, as it was for some 30
years after the war ended. The British success was predicated on the
Germans' conviction that their signals could not be read and that their
Enigma machines were entirely secure.
Those of us who suffer from varying degrees of mathematical illiteracy will
find the technical chapters describing the actual functioning of the
cryptographic machines and the methods used to encipher and decipher the
signals difficult, if not impossible, to follow, despite the excellent
diagrams and pictures. There are also the problems of trying to reproduce
the esprit de corps of the past, particularly for those of the
'professor-type' trained in the more austere disciplines of their craft.
Some sense of the camaraderie emerges; there are fascinating vignettes of
some of the key figures of the day, including the 20-year-old Harry Hensley
whose uncanny ability to interpret the German naval decrypts convinced the
Admiralty to treat the young man with the greatest respect.
For some, particularly those working on the production of Ultra
intelligence, the time at BP was clearly one of the high points of their
lives. For the 2,000 Wrens engaged on the painstaking work of maintaining
the 'bombes', the machines used for discovering the wheel-setting for Enigma
machines, life was as monotonous as it was stressful, and not made any
easier by their inability to say anything about their wartime activities.

<TEXT>
THE GREAT APE PROJECT by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer Fourth Estate
Pounds 9.99, 312 pages
LET US admit our fellow Great Apes - the chimpanzees, gorillas and
orang-utans - to the same moral community as ourselves, thereby according
them rights to life, to liberty, and to protection against torture -
especially the kind of torture inflicted in the name of scientific research.
Such, in sum, is the message of this important and spectacularly fascinating
collection of essays. Written by some of the world's foremost scientists and
philosophers, it launches the 'Great Ape Project', a campaign to bring our
fellow apes within the sphere of ethical concern at present reserved for
humans alone. And it does so in a highly readable and educative manner,
crammed with wide-ranging discussions of apes' use of language, the
evolution of the ape family, ape learning and behaviour, and lucidly written
accounts of the project's philosophical and legal implications.
All the Great Apes are so closely related that there is a mere 1.6 per cent
difference in the genetic constitution of humans and chimpanzees. The family
trees of today's humans and chimpanzees stem from the same ancestors less
than 7m years ago. Go back only another 2 or 3m years, and the human-chimp
branch of the clan shares common ancestors with today's gorillas. Ten
million years is a brief span in the history of life on earth. Yet we do not
need to contemplate this tiny evolutionary divergence, or the genetic
proximity between members of the Great Ape family, to recognise their
kinship: it was obvious long before scientists measured it.
It is indeed because of this very genetic closeness that some of the Great
Apes - chiefly, chimpanzees - are kept in captivity and subjected to medical
experiments for the benefit of other Great Apes - namely, humans. Imagine
this: a group of humans embarks on a colonial adventure, in the course of
which they capture specimens of other humans from other continents, and
exhibit them in their zoos - or, suitably stuffed and mounted, in their
museums; they breed them in research laboratories for experimental purposes;
they even hunt them for sport. Would there be much difference between this
and the way we treat our fellow apes? Humans have done - and sometimes still
do - these things to other humans, but we condemn their behaviour. The
eloquent argument of this book is that subjecting our fellow apes to this
treatment is equally wrong.
Chimpanzees do not have larynxes like humans, and therefore cannot vocalise
as humans do. But they can use language. Several essays describe the
acquisition of sign or code languages by chimpanzees, up to a developed
competence similar to that of a two-and-a-half year old human child. This
language-possession is genuine; it is not merely an elaborate mastery of
tricks, such as a circus dog might display. Chimpanzees formulate novel
sentences with which to communicate ideas and emotions, and they do so in
the course of their relations with their human companions in an entirely
natural way. This fact alone demands of us a radical shift in our attitudes
to them: how can we speak to them and yet still expropriate their forest
homes, lock them up in zoos, and inject fatal viruses into them?
Non-human apes, especially gorillas, were until recently demonised in film
and literature. Their similarity to us was used not as proof of kindred but
as a means of symbolising the supposed bestiality within us. When Dr Jekyll
drank his potion he exposed a mythologized savage inheritance; in some
depictions, his hands grow hairy, his brow beetles, his teeth enlarge: he
becomes a horrifying gorilla-man.
In the popular imagination, if it is not violence then it is stupidity which
marks the ape, betokened by tree-swinging, armpit-scratching and gibbering.
One way to insult someone is to call him an ape. Yet our fellow apes are
intelligent, inquisitive, affectionate and sociable creatures, with
capacities for suffering and grief that match our own, and with a grave
beauty and dignity to which many of these essays testify.
If you can think of arguments against treating non-human apes just as we
treat human apes - if, in particular, you think they should be accorded
fewer rights than humans - you will be sure to find powerful
counter-arguments to your view somewhere in this rich spread of essays. The
editors have performed splendidly in choosing and monitoring contributions
in such a way that every essay is a model of lucidity, informativeness, and
substance. Together the essays present an overwhelming case for a revision
in our treatment of our fellow apes. The editors and contributors press for
immediate acceptance of a 'Declaration' which demands for all Great Apes the
rights of life, liberty, and security from torture and experimentation.
Their essays powerfully show why we should agree.

MISS SMILLA'S FEELING FOR SNOW by Peter Hoeg Harvill Pounds 15.99/Pounds
9.99, 410 pages
WHITE BUTTERFLY by Walter Mosley Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99, 272 pages
SPY'S HONOUR by Gavin Lyall Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 383 pages
DECIDER by Dick Francis Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 278 pages
IT'S GOING to be a wonderful autumn for thrillers. Pile the logs on the
fire, take down the whisky bottle, and send the wife to bed. (Correction
where need be: send the husband to bed ..)
Miss Smilla's Feeling For Snow is a remarkable and not-to-be-missed
demonstration of the potential power of this genre. It's a novel, of course,
not a 'thriller' - but that has to be said of all good thrillers, because
the word, so inappropriate to the boring bulk of them, devalues the
exceptions.
Peter Hoeg is a young Danish writer and he has imagined the most fascinating
protagonist - a 37-year-old half-Eskimo woman, living alone in Copenhagen,
who realises, thanks to her 'feeling for snow', that there is something
wrong about a Greenlander child's apparently accidental death.
Miss Smilla pursues the mystery with the passion of the outsider and the
expertise of her northern upbringing, loving the snow and understanding it
as 'a symbol of the light of truth'. The finely detailed descriptions of her
investigation, which takes her deep into the Arctic, triumphantly creates a
world that is new to us, shocking, moving. The first half of the tale, set
in Copenhagen in winter, can scarcely be faulted: the second half, involving
a buried meteorite, Lovelock's Gaia Hypothesis, Nazi expeditions, parasitic
tapeworms, becomes more conventional, over-extended, a bit of a
disappointment. But Miss Smilla is a character you never met before.
I spotted Walter Mosley's first - Devil in a Blue Dress - on these pages a
couple of years ago and I insist again that he's a big talent. Here, after A
Red Death (just out in Pan) is the third of his chronological sequence of
the adventures of Easy Rawlins, the black private eye in post-war Los
Angeles, who operates in mean streets where not even Philip Marlowe dared to
go.
Raymond Chandler, you remember, wrote in a famous essay about those same
streets that his hero would have to be 'the best man in the world'. (Note
what must have been a deliberate reference in John le Carre's latest
best-seller to his villain being 'the worst man in the world'.) Easy Rawlins
is a splendid, lazy, cowardly, trouble-evading black man who loves children
and booze and is amassing a secret fortune in real estate, and yet he is
unmistakeably a moral figure -you can believe that he actually is 'the best
man in the world'.
Here, in White Butterfly, Easy has reached 1956 in Watts and is dragged in
to help track down a serial killer. His best friend is still the villainous
Moose, and Easy is still a family man, tending his garden, but this time
he's a bit too deep into the bottle and his marriage is on the skids, so
it's a darker story than before.
Years ago Gavin Lyall wrote superior, laconic thrillers about battered
freelance pilots flying battered small planes out of remote and battered
airstrips. He then got into a conventional Whitehall/spook series about a
not-very-interesting Major Maxim. His new idea, in Spy's Honour, is to go
back to the earliest days of the Secret Service, before the First War. This
1913 yarn of bumbling amateur spies in a pre-Sarajevo drama deserves to work
better. My notes read, in order -'Promising' - 'Preposterous' - 'Too long' -
'Confusing' - 'Boring' ..
There is nothing either helpful or positive to be said about the new Dick
Francis. Decider is his thirtysomethingth racing thriller, though this time
it doesn't have much about horses. The subject is a family drama about
ownership of a racecourse. The prose is as clumsy as ever, the characters as
stereotyped. His fans will not object.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Gardening: Strictly no secateurs in Hackney - Marilyn
Bentley strolls around the transformed plot of land adjoining the Geffrye
Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARILYN BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPT IN an alphabetical index, Hackney and horticulture are not obvious
bedfellows. But 300 years ago, the area east of the City of London was a
notable centre for nurseries, gardens and gardeners. That tradition inspired
Christine Lalumia, of the Geffrye Museum of the British Domestic Interior,
to turn the derelict plot of land adjoining the museum into a herb garden.
Opened in 1992, the garden was the first flowering of the Geffrye's new
status as a charitable trust. The construction of the outside 'room' was a
new departure for the museum. English Heritage consent was needed for the
proposed alterations, which included letting doors into two 'listed' walls
using a specially crafted oak lintel, and building a third wall of used
London bricks to replace the corrugated iron boundary fence.
The plan of the 50ft square garden is derived from monastic designs:
geometric paths and intersecting beds, with space for a wellhead in the
centre. The beds are stocked with 170 varieties of herb. Climbing plants,
such as roses, clematis, and jasmine, have been introduced to colonise the
trellises and the three arbours, adding aesthetic interest and colour.
The garden has developed almost like a tapestry in the course of planting
and growth. Rather than following any chronology, the plants are arranged
according to function: household; medicinal; cosmetic; and so on, creating a
living exposition of the uses to which herbs have been put in the past.
In a bed devoted to plant dyes you can find woad, used by the Anglo Saxons
for cloth and for warpaint. There are culinary herbs such as chives, sage,
sorrel and bay, and for the Elizabethan salad, which might include 50
different ingredients, parsley, chicory, rocket, primrose flower and
nasturtium.
Among the medicinal herbs are wound wort, the herba militaris of legend,
which Achilles used in the siege of Troy to stop his soldiers' wounds.
Feverfew was used to ease migraine, and St John's wort as a sedative.
In another bed is growing proof that herbal cosmetics did not start with
Body Shop. Skin cleansers were made with wild strawberry and lupin seed,
freckles lightened with ladies' mantle, hair tinted yellow with calendula.
Among the household herbs is soapwort, once used by the Romans for cleansing
delicate fabrics.
As well as its obvious function as an educational resource, Lalumia's
project encompasses the traditional ideal of a herb garden as a place of
tranquillity and repose. There is little enough opportunity for either among
the dreary council flats and derelict warehouses which dominate the area,
but visitors are encouraged to enjoy the garden as a 'hands-on' experience,
touching and smelling the aromatic plants which grow beside the seats.
She also sees the garden as an inspiration to aspiring gardeners, although
'I live in fear of ladies with secateurs,' she confesses. 'I hope people
will respect the garden enough not to take cuttings]' Herb seeds are sold in
the newly expanded shop, and in the future she hopes that cuttings from
garden stock will be available.
Access to the garden is via a spiral staircase leading from the museum's
discreetly expanded entrance foyer, the first phase of a series of projected
developments culminating in a new building intended to house a collection
illustrating the 20th century interior. Meanwhile, the herb garden
flourishes as a living museum which - like the best of furnishings - is both
functional and decorative.
The Geffrye Museum Herb Garden, Kingsland Road, London E2 8EA. Open April to
October 10am to 5pm, 2pm - 5pm Sundays and Bank Holidays. Closed Mondays.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Gardening: Erratic but worthwhile favours from Madonna -
Robin Lane Fox considers the lilies and how they grow and urges you to fix
your attention on a marvel of midsummer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT evenings have been perfect for garden watchers; the ground is too
hard to allow weeds to be pulled out and, instead, we can all trowel in the
coolness, enjoying the late phases of a wonderful gardening year. Thus, I
hate to disturb your peace; but, during the next week, there are
opportunities for up-grading which might slip your notice.
The most obvious, of course, is the ordering of next year's bulbs. Be warned
that it becomes ever harder to plant the early varieties in rough ground
because the autumns are now dry and the earth is baked firmly.
As I try to ram a bulb-planter into rough grass and fit a daffodil
underneath, I am reminded of those Israelites in Egypt making bricks with
useless materials. If you want an exodus, or way out, choose bulbs which you
can plant in the softer surface of flower beds.
My Top Six start with the wonderfully blue little iris, Histrioides Major,
which will resist the worst weather, and narcissus February Gold, which
seldom flowers in February and is not gold, either, but a bearable yellow at
a manageable height of 1ft. I prefer the small-flowered crocusses, of which
chrysanthus Blue Pearl and Cream Beauty are simply the best and will last
for ages.
Among the smaller tulips, I prefer Batalinii Bronze Charm because its colour
is unique and its stamina exceptional at a height of about 6in. Of the later
bedding tulips, I pick Sweet Harmony, in a lily-shaped yellow, and Queen of
Bartigons, in a tolerable pink, which I owe to the sharp eye of the late
Lanning Roper. Anemone blanda, either in mixed or single colours, runs off
the list at ground level wherever the soil is light and sunny so that the
flowers open fully.
The Top Six does not mean that there is not another Top 50, but a short-list
helps to concentrate disagreement. I have found that none of these bulbs
does the usual tulip trick of disappearing after one good year. I also find
that a few bulbs, spaced out in clumps, make much more of an impression than
those great sweeps by the hundred which are the neurotic reaction of those
who believe they can buy gardening, rather than think it through.
Bulb ordering directs our minds to spring, but the less obvious jobs direct
us to winter and mid-summer. Just now, you have a rare chance to bag some
winter irises. These are the forms with rushy leaves and exquisitely blue
flowers which are at home in Algeria and are sold in the UK at varying
prices as Unguicuilaris.
Most of the experts believe these plants will transplant or divide most
happily in September: in my long experience, they seem to be right. If you
can find an owner of an established clump, you are in with an excellent
chance.
At present, these winter irises look scruffy after a dry spell, and anyone
could be persuaded that they would be improved by gentle division. Claim a
piece for yourself, confident that you are doing no harm: my favourite, if
you can find it, is the darker blue form called Mary Barnard.
These irises are heaven-sent from early February onwards, perhaps even
earlier. Their natural companions are the Lenten roses or forms of
helleborus Orientalis.
The basic commandment of hellebore fanciers is that they fancy somebody
else's variety. Now is the time to strike here, too: during the next week,
you can still divide old groups of these plants into pieces of a single stem
and pot-up the divisions without harm.
I learnt this late tip from a great grower, the late EB Anderson. By the
time I knew him, he already had six gardens and 60 years' experience behind
him, and I have found that his advice is usually the best.
Further into the future, fix your mind on Madonna lilies, those white
marvels of mid-June which might seem thoroughly out of the news this month.
Not at all: now is the moment for ordering and planting them, a chance which
is often missed because they need earlier attention than other lilies in the
trade.
Madonna lilies are unpredictable in their favours: either they like your
garden or they do not, and surveys suggest there is no connection between
their favour and virginal habits of their owners. The important thing is to
plant them this month, a few inches deep and preferably in soil which is
full of lime and quite stony. If you are wondering which lily is a Madonna,
it is the one which has confronted you on Tuscan holidays in Italian
paintings of the Annunciation.
For a nativity at Christmas, a Madonna lily has always struck me as a
pre-natal anachronism: how could Gabriel have found one in full flower in
March, assuming that the unusual pregnancy was of the usual duration?
Angels, no doubt, do not place bulb orders; still, this painterly muddle of
the seasons at least reminds us to act when we might otherwise forget and
order and plant this superb lily now.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Property: Thailand beckons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU VIEW Florida as too dangerous and Tuscany as yesterday's scene, then
Thailand could be the place for your holiday home. So says a British agency
which can arrange for you to have a house built there by a company* with a
British managing director. It has sites for two developments of six to eight
houses on the Thai island of Phuket. One, at Kamala Bay, is close to a
palm-fringed beach which is largely undeveloped and sweeps in an arc for
nearly a mile.
The design of the detached guideline house will be a modern adaptation of
Thai style with a steeply pitched roof, concrete frame, rendering or
plasterwork, ceramic tiling and a lot of teak. There will be three bedrooms
and balconies, living and dining rooms, a maid's room and a garden.
Specifications can be amended for individuals.
A foreigner cannot own land freehold in Thailand but he can lease it, and
any building on leased land can be sold separately. Leases can be up to 90
years (30 years plus two pre-paid 30-year extensions).
The total price of a house on Phuket, including 90-year lease and purchase
costs, is likely to be from Pounds 140,000 up and there is an annual lease
administration fee of about Pounds 400. To offset the costs, however, there
is a lot of foreign demand for renting.
Land prices in Thailand are low compared with other countries, says Jeremy
Adler of Villas Abroad (Properties) which is handling the Phuket project.
You can build at any time within three years after signing up.
Thailand (once Siam) is a constitutional monarchy about the size of France.
Phuket, about 30 miles long, is off a peninsula on the west coast near the
Malaysian border and is reached by a causeway. Apart from Patong, which is
lively and colourful, most of its resorts are small, but it does have its
own airport.
Many might see the 14 hours' flying time from London (including transfer at
Bangkok) as a deterrent, and return air fares can be anything from Pounds
500 to Pounds 1,500. But long-haul destinations have become popular with
some holiday-makers bored with resorts close to home and full of
fellow-Britons.
*The development company offering these properties is Phuket Land and its
British managing director is William Pinsent. Villas Abroad (Properties) can
be telephoned on 081-891 5444. Information about land-buying in Thailand can
also be obtained from the country's information service, tel. 071-584 5421.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Property: Not impossible - just difficult - Foreign buyers
still face a host of obstacles in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW factor in the already immensely complicated process of trying to
purchase Swiss vacation property is altitude. With the recent trend to
milder winters in central Europe, many formerly popular resorts no longer
have secure supplies of snow and, consequently, it seems that their
attraction to the foreign buyer is waning.
Take, for example, Crans Montana and Villars. Crans Montana, a resort in
Valais with a lot of skiing over 2,500 metres, has sold out its 1993 quota
for foreigners already. Villars, a resort above Montreux that has long
welcomed foreigners, is having a tougher time and, recently, pleaded with
the authorities to ease the buying restrictions on them. Among other well
known resorts that have little or no skiing above 2,500 meters are
Grindelwald, Arosa, Morgins and Gstaad, although most of them have other
attractions to compensate. That is just as well, because hopes last year
that the panoply of restrictions on foreign buyers would be lifted in the
near future have been dashed.
The plan was that Switzerland would join the European Economic Area (EEA),
the proposed expanded free trade zone among the 12 countries of the European
Community and the seven members of the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA). Under the EEA treaty, Switzerland would have had to accept the EC's
so-called four freedoms, including the right of any citizen of the area to
own property anywhere within it.
Both Switzerland and Austria, which foresaw hordes of Germans descending on
their choicest alpine valleys, managed to negotiate the maximum five-year
transition period before their property markets would have to open. The most
threatened communities would probably have passed by-laws putting severe
limits on all property transactions (acceptable to Brussels because they
were non-discriminatory).
On December 6, however, a majority of Swiss voters rejected the EEA treaty.
So, for the moment, the situation in Switzerland remains, if not totally
impossible, quite difficult. The federal Lex Friedrich simply prohibits
investments in property by foreigners. In fact, there are exceptions, which
is obvious to anyone who thinks of the procession of famous people - from
conductor Sir Georg Solti to golfer Nick Faldo  - who have retreats in the
country. A foreigner who has a permanent resident's permit, for example, can
buy anything he wishes. A foreigner who has to work in Switzerland can buy
his principal residence there.
Foreigners also can buy vacation homes in the most popular alpine cantons -
Graubunden, Ticino, Valais, Vaud and the Bernese Oberland - but only subject
to a maze of limitations. First, there is an overall national annual quota
on sales to foreigners which is split among these cantons. But individual
communities retain the right not to participate. Several of the most famous
ones, such as Zermatt, St Moritz, Saas Fee and Davos have stopped allowing
foreigners to buy chalets and apartments. Some are even indulging in ethnic
cleansing, insisting that, when a foreigner sells, only a native can buy.
Then, there is a limit on the number of properties in any given development
that can be offered to foreigners (usually about 30 per cent) and a limit on
the size of property a foreigner may buy (100 square meters of living space
and 1,000 square meters on the total property). But these space limits apply
only on developments authorised after 1986, so older properties may be
larger.
To discourage speculation, the authorities insist that a foreigner must not
re-sell his property within given periods - for five years if to a Swiss, or
10 years to another foreigner. And, finally, in the typically thorough Swiss
way, purchases by foreigners must be vetted by the police and approved by
both local and national governments. 'Many people are put off by these laws,
but people do still buy,' says Jean Pierre Bernini, an agent with Revac in
Geneva. 'The motivation is perhaps less a holiday home as such but more the
fact that it is a safe country with a strong currency and completely
independent of an uncertain European scenario.'
David de Lara, of David de Lara &amp; Partners, a London agency specialising in
Swiss vacation property, also emphasises the investment angle. 'At the very
worst, you will get the price you paid for a property. Look at the people
who bought in France and Spain. Now, they are stuck.'
Of course, safety, stability and independence do not come cheaply, and the
recent round of currency devaluations in many European countries has made
Swiss property even dearer for the foreign buyer. And while Swiss urban
property prices have declined sharply in the past three years, vacation
properties have held up reasonably well. Prices for properties available to
foreigners have held up even better, mainly because of the quotas.
An 80 sq metre, two-bedroom flat in Villars is still going to cost at least
SFr300,000; (Pounds 136,370) in more trendy Gstaad, perhaps three times as
much. That charming, traditional, fully detached chalet with a garden on an
alp costs rather more - unless you are willing to be in a less popular area.
De Lara offers chalets from Pounds 180,000 in places such as Champery and
Auxere.
Potential purchasers should be aware that the quotas also apply to re-sale.
In other words, if and when you come to sell your chalet or flat to another
foreigner, that transaction would have to be authorised from within the
annual quota for the locality. And, naturally, the authorities give priority
to applications for new developments when allocating their quota. So, there
may be a delay of some months before the sale can be made.
Following the defeat of the EEA treaty, the Swiss federal government has
adopted a policy of implementing as much EC compatible legislation as
possible. Thus, it is planning to review its policy on foreign property
ownership in the autumn, with a prospect of less restrictive legislation
being introduced next year. But the word in Bern is: don't hold your breath.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSH into the recreational on-off/road 4 x 4 market has seen the Land
Rover and Daihatsu Fourtrak (photographed right) put up a stout fight
against gentrification. The Land Rover Defender, although equipped some
years ago with the Range Rover's more civilised underpinnings, remains a
working vehicle.
Some might say it is now the smartest 4 x 4 of all in which to be seen
because it implies, first, that you have broad acres and, second, that you
suffer its discomforts gladly because you - or your men - must be able to
drive to the furthest, muddiest parts of your estate loaded with straw bales
or Fortnum's hampers.
Capable though they are off road, most of the Shoguns and Troopers,
Discoveries and Mavericks, Cherokees and Fronteras, Land Cruisers and
Vitaras are seen on school runs and in supermarket car parks, not axle deep
in mire. As Glass's Guide, the car trade's bible, noted the other day, these
life-style on-off/roaders bucked the recession and sales are reaching new
heights. They are bought by seekers after individuality, many of whom had
found their beloved hot hatchbacks no longer insurable at sensible cost.
The Daihatsu Fourtrak never really fitted the recreational mould, though. It
was a worker, with simple leaf springs and a beefy diesel engine. Farmers
love Fourtraks. You see a lot of them, battered and long suffering, hauling
sheep trailers in the wilder parts of Britain.
The life-style market is, however, too big to be ignored and Daihatsu wants
a larger slice of it. So, the latest Fourtrak has independent front
suspension, a coil sprung back axle, wheel arch extensions to accommodate
fatter tyres, and a wider track. The car-like interior seats five, or seven
if you sacrifice all luggage space.
It still feels rugged, and it banged about resiliently on moorland tracks on
the Isle of Man where I drove one recently. The on-road ride and handling
are much better than before although, as the wheelbase is still fairly
short, it is more inclined to pitch on minor roads than, say, a long
wheelbase Shogun, Maverick or Frontera.
One is more aware of its 2.8-litre, 100 horsepower turbo-diesel than in an
ultra-refined, Nissan-built Ford Maverick or Terrano II. Not that this is
likely to trouble the traditional kind of buyer who pulls a two-horse
trailer; a Fourtrak tows up to 3,500 kg. Prices are Pounds 15,650 for a TDL,
Pounds 16,895 for the better equipped TDX.

FT  04 SEP 93 / A paean of praise to capitalism: Lord Lawson expands on his
personal view of the free market as an economic philosophy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Free markets work well, but so does the law of the jungle. Therefore even
some Tories worry about the unacceptable face of capitalism. This week at
the British Association's annual conference, Lord Lawson, former
Conservative Chancellor and leading thinker of the Thatcher era, offered a
robust defence of capitalism, as not only the most efficient economic
system, but as one which may claim moral superiority. Here we print an
edited version of his talk
THROUGHOUT the western world, and notably since the coming into office of
the Thatcher government in the UK in 1979 and the Reagan Administration in
the US in 1981, capitalism has appeared to be in the ascendant and socialism
in retreat. During the 1980s much of the developing world, too, came
belatedly to recognise the benefits, and adopt the policies, of the market
economy.
In eastern Europe, the collapse of Communism and the command economy has
revealed a landscape of economic failure, poverty, and environmental
degradation on a scale that few had believed possible. The most passionate
supporters of the capitalist market economy today are to be found among the
ablest of the new leaders of these countries.
It is not surprising that people give of their best in a climate of freedom,
within a legal and institutional framework of order and justice. Nor is it
in any way surprising that the rational decisions needed to make a modern
economy even halfway efficient can be taken only by a multiplicity of
decision-makers armed with the knowledge provided by a myriad of market
prices.
Yet, while its practical success, and its demonstrable superiority over all
known alternative economic systems, is no longer open to question,
capitalism is still widely seen as morally suspect.
Why should this be so, given its unrivalled and proven ability to improve
living standards and eliminate large-scale poverty, and its unique harmony
with the political virtues of freedom and democracy? In part, the
explanation lies in sloppy thinking. There is a frequent tendency to
contrast, consciously or subconsciously, the market capitalism we know, with
all the faults and flaws we see around us, with some ideal economic order
which would, almost by definition, be free of these imperfections. But in an
imperfect world, the only valid comparison is with other systems which
actually exist.
Similarly there is a parochial predilection to blame the moral failings of
man on the nature of the politico-economic system in place where the critic
happens to reside.
But in the case of the alleged moral failings of capitalism, it has to be
conceded that there is rather more to it than that.
Morality, as most people see it, is a matter partly of motivation and partly
of outcomes. And market capitalism is widely seen as defective in both
respects So far as motivation is concerned, it is seen as a system based on
self interest, the very antithesis of morality. For what is the essence of a
moral code if it is not the curbing of selfishness and self-gratification?
As for the outcome, while the population as a whole might benefit from
capitalism, that benefit is shared to an unequal extent that many feel ipso
facto immoral.
It is these two characteristics, self-interest and inequality, that largely
explain the alleged moral deficiencies of capitalism. Let me take them each
in turn.
A regard for one's self-interest is a prominent feature in the make-up of
almost all mankind. It is not the only feature, but it is a uniquely
powerful one. Moreover, it is hard to see how, without it, a large-scale
free society could possibly be governable. A socialist or statist
government, besides its apparatus of restrictions and controls, creates,
through the tax system and grants of one kind and another, inducements
designed to encourage those forms of economic behaviour it believes to be
desirable. But unless people sought to advance their self-interest, these
inducements would clearly be ineffective.
The characteristic of market capitalism is not that it alone is based on the
idea of channelling self-interest for the greater good - not that there is
anything wrong with that. It is rather that it is a unique mechanism for
doing so directly, with the least interposition of government.
Why, then, is market capitalism alone thought to be based on the allegedly
morally disreputable concept of the pursuit of self-interest? Partly,
perhaps, because Adam Smith, more than 200 years ago, was so disarmingly
honest about it. Those who seek to commend a politico-economic system are
expected to be decently hypocritical, and to flatter their audience in
loftier tones.
But it is also partly because, whereas capitalism is customarily discussed
in terms of the motives of the governed, socialism is usually considered in
terms of the motives of those in government. Even that, however, is very
much a distinction without a difference.
There is little practical evidence that politicians and bureaucrats are
wholly altruistic beings, on a higher moral plane than vulgar businessmen -
as that admirable television documentary, 'Yes, Prime Minister', has well
illustrated.
It is true that in a country such as ours, where pecuniary corruption is
rare, there is the distinction that, whereas businessmen seek financial
reward, politicians seek votes.
But that is no basis for according moral superiority to a system in which
more decisions are taken by politicians and bureaucrats, and fewer by
businessmen and ordinary people.
Moreover, there are important positive moral arguments in favour of market
capitalism, quite apart from the freedom and liberty on which it is based,
and the beneficent results to which it has led.
In the first place, to the extent to which it gives greater freedom than
other systems - albeit still within strict limits, set by the rule of law
for the peaceful pursuit of self-interest - in practice that means the
natural desire of men and women to benefit not merely themselves but also
their family and their children.
To my mind this is a vitally important extension, not to be dismissed as
genetic selfishness. When parents neglect their children (or worse), as in
recent well-publicised 'home alone' cases and the like, we do not regard
this as a lack of genetic selfishness, but with horror as morally
unacceptable behaviour. Subordinating one's own personal interest to that of
one's family is not the beginning and end of altruism, to be sure; but it is
the beginning.
The family, which looms large in the scheme of market capitalism, is not
only the foundation of a stable society, but an important bulwark against
tyranny - as, of course, is the institution of private property, the more
widely spread the better. Hence the infallible rule that tyrannies always
seek to weaken if not destroy the family.
Another key feature of market capitalism is the private sector,
nonmonopolistic, firm. Capitalism is sometimes portrayed either as
monopolistic exploitation or an unattractive competitive jungle, where the
values of co-operation are lost in a free-for-all. What this overlooks is
that the private sector firm itself provides a model of effective
co-operation.
These two institutions, the family and the firm, come together, of course,
in that much-derided corporate entity, the family business.
While more important at earlier stages of development than later stages, and
in some cultures than in others, I suspect that the value of the family
business and the culture it represents has been insufficiently recognised.
But while the misguided moral critique of market capitalism as irredeemably
selfish has been allowed to acquire considerable resonance, an even more
powerful ground for moral disfavour has been the inequality to which it
leads.
Yet in these terms, the closer the charge is examined the less impressive it
appears. There is clearly no principle of equality that has any conceivable
merit. Equality in misery is of no value to anyone. Nor is it clear whether
equality should be considered within the context of the nation and society
in which we live or in the wider context of the world as a whole. Even in
the narrower context, it is doubtful if there can be more than a tiny
minority of eccentrics who wish to see a society in which absolute equality
is the rule. Yet once it is accepted that there must be inequality, the
principle of equality (if there ever was one) has been abandoned, and we are
left not with morality but with something that looks rather like an amalgam
of aesthetics and envy.
Not that absolute equality, or anything approaching it, is possible anyway
(which is one good reason why it has never existed anywhere, at any time).
For one thing, there is more than one dimension of equality: it is not
simply a matter of income and wealth. In particular, the closer to pecuniary
equality a government seeks to move, the greater the coercive powers needed
to achieve this, and the greater the inequality of power between government
and governed.
Moreover, absolute equality, even in the sense in which it is theoretically
attainable, must of necessity lead to misery. If there is to be no greater
reward for work or saving or effort of any kind than is meted out to those
who decline to work or save or make any effort, then remarkably little work,
saving or effort will be undertaken. This is not simply an elementary
economic proposition. It is also intimately connected with a more robust
moral sentiment: that associated with equity and desert. If two people are
working at the same job, with equal skill, and one chooses to work overtime
while the other does not, failure to pay the former more would be seen as
not merely self-defeating but grossly inequitable.
It is true that large disparities in rates of pay can give rise,
particularly when hyped up by the populist press, to storms of apparent
moral outrage. But this has nothing to do with attachment to any principle
of equality. People do not expect some third division nonentity to be paid
the same as Eric Cantona, nor me the same as Pavarotti, should I inflict my
singing on you.
For all these reasons, the egalitarian argument is usually couched in terms
of more equality. However, once the legitimacy of egalitarianism is
accepted, however much equality there is, the cry will always be for more of
it.
It is, moreover, the combination of the insatiability of egalitarianism with
the impossibility of achieving equality that causes the elevation of
equality into the touchstone of political morality to be a recipe for
maximising discontent. In a sense, indeed, it is positively immoral.
However, although market capitalism is the best system ever devised for the
avoidance of large-scale poverty and for enabling the poor to improve their
lot, it manifestly does not ensure the elimination of poverty altogether.
That is why voters rightly expect any government to operate a social
security system for the relief of poverty, and why all governments, however
wedded to market capitalism, in practice do so.
There are obviously a number of practical questions involved in this. It is
not merely a case of how poverty is to be defined, but also whether relief
should be targeted or part of some universal benefit (overwhelmingly the
former, I believe), whether other dimensions such as age should be taken
into account whether relief for the unemployed poor should be linked to some
form of workfare (I believe it should), and so on.
But the key point is this. So far from making a case against market
capitalism, the existence of an underclass is a challenge to find a means of
minimising its size and saving those in it from degradation without in any
way undermining market capitalism or detracting from the benefits that
system has proved itself to be uniquely capable of providing.
Just as the sensible successful businessman who seeks to help those less
fortunate will do so not by changing the way he runs his business but by
applying part of his personal wealth to philanthropy, so the wise government
will best help the poor not by interfering with the market but by creating a
well-designed social security safety net alongside it.
Throughout modern history, market capitalism has sought to rest its case on
its practical success - a relative success which, over the past five years,
events in central and eastern Europe have shown in a particularly telling
light. Socialism, by contrast, has been forced by practical failure onto the
high ground of morality.
Perhaps we could leave it there. Perhaps we should adapt the description of
the Roundheads and Cavaliers in 1066 And All That and accept that capitalism
is right but repulsive, whereas socialism is wrong but romantic. But I would
not feel comfortable in doing so. Success, which is inevitably incomplete
anyway, will sooner or later always be taken for granted, and then the moral
assault, if unanswered, will gain ground.
At the very least, if we are to live within a market capitalist system, it
is unsatisfactory that we should have doubts about its moral foundations.
One or two recent speeches even by some members of the present government
betray a worrying insecurity in this context.
In seeking to repudiate the moral critique of capitalism, and to suggest
that it should not be held responsible for the moral imperfection of man, I
do not need to win my case. For even a stand-off in the moral dimension is
enough to allow market capitalism's undoubted superiority in the world of
practical achievement to win the day.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Sport: Putting the fun back into racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Bank Holiday Monday, nearly 20,000 people crammed into Thruxton, a rather
basic and unassuming circuit near Andover in Hampshire, for the latest round
of the British Touring Car Championship.
This is about the same number of people that insiders claim attended the
European Grand Prix at Donington Park in April. It is a far cry from the few
hundred devotees that will attend the average Thruxton club meeting.
The success of the BTCC comes when motor racing is feeling the pinch after
the heady days of the 1980s. The most publicised case is Formula One, motor
racing's flagship, where crowds have been sharply down at many grand prix
and dull racing has provoked something of an existential crisis.
Move outside the exotic world of Formula One and motor racing is in a
parlous state.
The international sports car championship collapsed because of lack of
interest from manufacturers and the public. Formula 3000 and Formula 3, the
two major single-seater series which act as the breeding ground for Formula
One, attract pitiful attendances.
Against this depressing backdrop, the BTCC is regularly attracting crowds in
excess of 20,000 in this season's 17-race series, not only at the showcase
circuits like Silverstone and Brands Hatch, but also the more obscure ones.
Of course, saloon car racing has always had what might be described as a
certain basic appeal.
I remember as a little boy going to my first race meetings in the 1950s and
watching the big Jags wallowing like small boats through the corners, their
thin tyres screeching for grip.
But the present extraordinary popularity of touring car racing is a recent
phenomenon. The key moment was the decision in 1990 to confine the cars to a
single class of two litres followed, in 1991, by the ceding of control over
the series to the Touring Car Association (TOCA).
A new and coherent philosophy came to inform the series. The single class
promised close racing. The decision to ban gizmos like traction control and
ABS had a similar effect, while also helping to restrict costs.
The emphasis was entertainment rather than technology. The drivers are
paraded round the circuit before the race. Unlike in Formula One, where the
numbers on the cars are now so small that one is reduced to identifying the
drivers by the design of their crash helmets, the name of the driver is
clearly emblazoned on the side window.
There is a conscious effort to give motor racing a family appeal. Each race
is promoted on television and in the press. Races are shown on BBC
Grandstand. As Alan Gow, the managing director of TOCA, said: 'If we didn't
have television, BTCC wouldn't be where it is'.
The package has attracted manufacturers in droves. There are now eight works
teams - Vauxhall, Ford, BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Renault, Mazda and Peugeot -
with several, including Mercedes, Audi and Alfa Romeo, reputedly waiting in
the wings.
Manufacturer involvement in Formula One looks puny in comparison.
The attraction is obvious. The costs are reasonable: in the region of Pounds
1.2m per season for a two-car team. The promotional value is considerable.
And, with the racing close and unpredictable, there are many winners and few
losers over the course of a season. The BTCC has hit upon a successful
formula, with crowds, TV, sponsors and manufacturers seemingly forming a
virtuous circle.
The message of BTCC coincides with that of Nicola Foulston, proprietor of
Brands Hatch, who threatens to become the enfant terrible of the motor
racing establishment - a status owing not a little to the fact that she is a
26-year- old woman operating in a man's world.
Foulston is critical of 'the old blazers and cravats' who have long
dominated the domestic scene and she is not afraid to make some pungent and
apposite remarks about Fisa, the governing body of motor sport.
She asks many of the right questions: how can motor racing reach out to a
new public; what should it do for the spectator (who is taken for granted in
a manner which has led to much soul-searching in other sports such as
soccer); how can it create new and successful formulae (not least in view of
Fisa's failure in this area), and how can it compete in the entertainment
industry?
Toca's Alan Gow has a similar refrain: 'Motor racing has to broaden its
appeal from the enthusiast to the casual spectator. It is competing for
their disposable income. The Oulton Park circuit is in the same market as
Alton Towers.'
The immediate inspiration for the BTCC series comes from the German touring
car championship, which is attracting crowds of more than 70,000, rather
larger than most grand prix. But Gow's eyes are set west. He believes the
American experience is the most instructive.
There is growing recognition that Indycar racing has much to teach Formula
One, with the latter grudgingly admitting as much this season by enrolling
in a crash course to try and learn the lessons.
But Indycar is by no means the most successful American series. That honour
belongs to NASCAR, the American oval saloon car race series. Gow is
emphatic: 'We take our lead from NASCAR and drag racing'.
The success of the BTCC could be a straw in the wind for a sport which is
crying out for new thinking. It looks outwards in contrast to the old club
mentality which set its sights firmly inwards. It believes in the spectator,
where Formula One has only had eyes for the television cameras.
Finally, perhaps the BTCC is telling us something else. Could we be moving
into an era in which touring car racing replaces single-seaters as motor
racing's biggest draw?

FT  04 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Three market leaders from Tuscany - An instant
success story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS rare indeed for a high-quality, high-price wine to become within its
field an international market leader almost on its launch; least of all an
Italian one. Yet this has happened to three: Tignanello, Sassicaia and now
Ornelleia.
Tignanello is the vineyard name of part of the St Cristine Chianti vineyard
of the historic Florentine firm of Antinori, owned today by Marchese Piero
Antinori. Eighty per cent Sangiovese and 20 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon, it
did not follow the official DOC Chianti grape formula and was launched in
1971 as just a vino da tavola with almost instant success. It combined the
rich fruitiness of old-vine Sangiovese with the elegant bouquet and flavour
of the Bordeaux grape. Production now varies between 15,000 and 25,000 cases
per year.
Sassicaia began differently. It had long been the tradition of rich Italian
families to import wines from France but, in 1944, the Marchese Mario Incisa
planted on his San Guido estate, at Bolgheri on the Tuscan coast, half a
hectare with 85 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon and 15 per cent Cabernet France,
to yield 2,000 bottles a year for his family consumption.
His wife was the sister of Marchese Piero Antinori's mother and, in 1971/72,
he put on the market the 1968 vintage under the vineyard name of Sassicaia.
A quick sell-out led to gradual extension of the vineyard, which now covers
30 ha and annually yields about 10,000 cases.
Ornelleia is the brain-child of Piero Antinori's brother, Lodovico.
At the end of the 1970s, he decided to establish a winery on the Bolgheri
family estate.
The first vines - 80 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon, 15 per cent Merlot and 5
per cent Cabernet Franc - were planted in 1980, and the first vintage of
15,000 bottles came in 1985. The vineyard has been steadily increased, and
separate ones started to produce Merlot and Sauvignon wines, and less
expensive blends. The first Ornellaia released on the international market
was the 1989, now followed by the 1990 with 6,250 cases, but more than 8,000
of the '91 and nearly 12,000 of the '92 will be available; and a maximum of
more than 20,000 cases is planned; more than double the neighbouring
Sassicaia's settled total.
On a recent visit, I was fortunate to have vertical testings of all three
wines on their estates. All are made in new oak barriques.
Tignanello '89 - generally, not a good vintage in Tuscany and this lacked
body and was short, but an agreeable, easy-drinking wine. '86 - elegant and
mature with real Cabernet flavour, but to be drunk. '85 - big colour, rich
nose and concentrated flavour. The finest wine of the tasting and Tignanello
at its best. '81 - full colour, line, mature old bouquet, elegant taste, a
classic wine of its kind. '77 - brownish colour, with a chocolate nose, some
dryness on the palate, but a sweet finish. A complete wine. '71 - the wine
of the original vintage had an old claret appearance and flavour, but no
decay. Not only did Tignanello start the fashion for high-quality vino da
tavola, but it has never been rivalled in demand or excelled in quality.
Sassicaia '92 - a barrique sample, with very good colour, elegant nose and
line balance. '91 - also from a barrique, but a lighter wine with an
oak-scented nose. '90 - still closed bouquet and flavour, but full-coloured
and well-structured; should turn out very well. '88 - much more developed,
with full colour but perhaps less roundness and richness. '85 - a supple
wine, ready to drink, but not all that distinguished. '82 - brown-tinged,
but with a rich nose and full, sweet flavour; an exceptional wine at its
peak. '81 showing some age, but elegant and sweet. '78 - exceptional colour
for its age, with a sort, engaging bouquet and light body.
Ornelleia '91 - good colour, but typically light on nose and taste for the
year; short. '90 - very rich wine, with big colour, very rich, oaky nose and
a taste of prunes. Still closed; less concentrated than Sassicaia. '89 - an
easy-drinking, fairly light wine as the vintage mostly dictated. '88 - very
big colour, and concentrated bouquet and flavour. A strong wine, still
tannic and to be kept. '87 - fair colour but lacked fruit on nose, with some
dryness on palate. A moderate-only year, yet still fair drinking.
The Marchese Lodovico clearly has wider ambitions than his neighbour, cousin
and fellow Ornelleia director, Marchese Nicolo Incisa. Yet the latter has
one important advantage. His wines have an average age of 25 years, whereas
Ornelleia's are much younger. Sassicaia is also kept longer in cask. None of
these wines is for early drinking. Style, and quality as well as price,
demand definite if variable maturing times for all three.
Winecellars, London, SW18 (Tel: 081-871-2668) lists Sassicaia '89, Ornelleia
'90 at Pounds 23.85, and Lay &amp; Wheeler (0206-764446), of Colchester, Essex,
has Tignanello 1988 at Pounds 21.80.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Lo's life and times - A critical look at four
new food books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE restaurateur and cookery book writer Kenneth Lo is 80 this month and
September also sees the publication of his autobiography: The Feast of My
Life (Doubleday, Pounds 16.99, 216 pages).
I was surprised to learn that Lo had had such a varied career before he
turned to the kitchen stove: scholar, tennis player and consular official.
This book contains some choice episodes from his life.
In particular I enjoyed his brief appearance at the Berlin Olympics in 1936
when he stayed at a Chinese restaurant in the Kanststrasse; the years of
poverty in Cambridge, where he learned to eat cheese, and the destruction of
the city's only Chinese restaurant by a direct hit from a German bomb; and
his work with Chinese sailors in Liverpool where he was able to quell a race
riot by sitting the local West Indians down to a Chinese meal. The passage
which touched me most, however, concerned Lo's return to China after 54
years to find his patrician family reduced to poverty by the cultural
revolution.
Lo has been poorly served by his editor. This book contains an intolerable
number of spelling mistakes and some nasty English.
Presentation is one of the strong points in Nigel Buxton's Walking in the
Wine Country (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 20, 250 pages). The book is
filled with some ravishing photography by Glyn Williams and Buxton's writing
is often a joy.
For me it was more a book about walking than it was about wine: Buxton is a
hesitant wine writer and generally contents himself with citing his
favourite authorities on each area, rather like some medieval theologian
invoking the Fathers of the Church. He also falls into a French-sprung trap
about Alsace. Alsatian is not a French dialect as implied here, but a German
one, similar to Swiss German. Nor was Alsace annexed by 'the Prussians' in
1871, it became a Reichsland, ie part of the new German Empire.
I most enjoyed Buxton's descriptions of meals and, by the end, I had an
abiding vision of a man either relaxing beside a hotel fire with a large
glass of cognac in his hand, after a long hike, or sitting at the top of
some hill with a picnic lunch and a bottle of wine.
My complaint about this book is that it is misleading. I lived in France for
seven years and I think I know the people. The French do not understand
eccentricity and the sight of a lone man walking across private property
with a bottle in his hand is more likely to make them suspicious than to
excite feelings of hospitality.
If, on the other hand, you are a journalist with a story or even a book to
write, a French winemaker's attitude can be wonderfully expansive. The dogs
seem to speak the true voice of France in this book: 'hideous, unrestrained'
 -the Dobermann in Chagny. They never fail to bark and snarl at his
approach. So far as Buxton's sugar-sweet, French people are concerned: he
has either been unbelievably lucky or he is pulling our legs.
Antony Worrall Thompson is something of a walking publicity machine, so it
might come as a surprise that it has taken him so long to want to squash his
wisdom into covers hard or soft.
Now, with Malcolm Gluck of The Guardian newspaper, he has produced Supernosh
(Faber &amp; Faber, Pounds 7.99, 221 pages), a collection of his favourite
dishes with notes on what wines to serve with them.
I must confess that I am not over-impressed by Worrall Thompson. I have
eaten a number of meals which he has cooked and even more which were served
in his restaurants. One of his signature dishes is a plate of lamb shanks
with mashed potatoes. At Bistrot 190 I had to send this back as I was unable
to get a fork into the lamb. Out of interest I tried the same concoction in
his newer, Del Ugo restaurant some time later and found the lamb equally
unappetising; but that was nothing to the mash, which had been liquidised
and had the consistency of glue.
I mentioned this second bad meal to his personal assistant who insisted I
come back; that the problem had been caused by staff problems etc. I had the
same dish and the PA was forced to admit that it suffered from identical
faults. I was obliged to console myself with one of Worrall Thompson's
'one-pot' dinners.
This book might have been excusable if it contained recipes, but it does
not. It is a collection of jottings containing advice on how to prepare the
sort of pseudo-Mediterranean food advocated by Worrall Thompson. In a number
of instances he implies that the dish is too difficult for readers to make
at home and that they should therefore simply go to one of his restaurants
and eat it there. Hmm: need I say more? Nor can I say I am wholly convinced
by the wine matches. There are a few useful rules about what wines to serve
with food and Gluck simply abandons them.
On the other hand, if you are buying wine at the supermarket some of Gluck's
recommendations will be of interest, for this is the field he has made his
own. In this case I suggest you buy his book Superplonk (also Faber).
In contrast to Supernosh, Good Pub Food by Susan Nowak (Camra Books, Pounds
9.95, 439 pages) is a really useful book. I was grateful to the author on a
recent visit to touristy Broadway in Worcestershire, for through her
guidance I found the Crown and Trumpet with its wholesome food, good beers
and friendly service. Anyone who gets out to the English countryside should
possess a copy.

<TEXT>
THIS has been a disaster year in our garden. The courgettes curled up and
died. The white currants refused to fruit. The runner beans failed to run. I
began to despair of enjoying any home-grown produce.
But gardeners are kind-hearted and generous people, well versed in the
charitable practice of visiting the sick and the dying. Word of our
predicament spread and we have received a stream of commiserations, many
from visitors who bring a harvest of offerings from their own gardens.
There have been bunches of the sweetest-ever young carrots, beetroots
ranging in size from ping-pong to tennis ball, the newest of new potatoes,
courgettes, runner beans (yellow-podded as well as green), squeaky-fresh
spinach, armfuls of flat leaf parsley, green coriander and rocket, lettuces
of various shapes and hues, and cucumbers and tomatoes of unparalleled
flavour. Special thanks to Edna and Alex Cross, Louise Mollo, Phoebe
Wickham, Carl Telemacque and, most of all, to Doris and Bob Bennett. As a
result of their kindness, here is a trio of salads we have enjoyed.
ROCKET WITH SWEET PEPPERS AND PARMESAN
Use whatever quantities and whatever ratio of ingredients you like for this
robustly flavoured salad, which makes an admirable appetiser. If you do not
have gardening friends to help with providing fresh ingredients, or if time
is short, a jar of roasted and skinned red peppers preserved in olive oil
can be used instead of peppers prepared freshly at home.
Grill two or three red peppers until the skin is blistered and black all
over and the flesh feels soft underneath. Strip off the papery skins as soon
as cool enough to handle. Discard stalks, seeds and pith and cut the flesh
into strips.
Dress them with fruity olive oil, sea salt and black pepper. Add a dash of
lemon juice, also a smidgeon of very finely-chopped garlic if liked. Toss
and leave to marinate for at least one hour. Overnight is better.
To serve, lay the peppers on a bed of rocket leaves and scatter another
handful of rocket over them. Drizzle the marinade juices over the leaves and
scatter with thinly-shaved curls of Parmesan cheese.
POTATO, TOMATO AND WATERCRESS SALAD
Adapted slightly from Dorothy Hartley's Food In England, this makes a
delicious and useful light lunch dish.
Skin and slice 1lb or so of well ripened and richly flavoured tomatoes. Lay
them in a shallow dish. Season lightly with salt and pepper and sprinkle
generously with chopped mint and chives.
Steam or boil an equal weight of thickly sliced La Ratte or Charlotte
potatoes. Drain well and dress them with a few spoonfuls of well seasoned
single cream (or with a dollop of home-made mayonnaise thinned with milk to
the consistency of single cream).
Lay the potatoes, as soon as cool, over the tomatoes. Scatter a few stoned
and halved black olives here and there, cover with a close carpet of
watercress sprigs, and drizzle a soupcon of olive oil and vinegar over the
whole lot. Two to three parts oil to one part vinegar works well here, and
balsamic vinegar is to be recommended.
MANGO WITH PRAWNS, CORIANDER AND LIME
The essential ingredient here is that elusive commodity, a well ripened
mango. Not, alas, something my gardening neighbours can supply, but easier
to buy (and often cheaper) at this season than at other times of the year.
Allow a handful of North Atlantic prawns per person and one perfectly ripe
mango between four people for a first course.
Shell the prawns, saving the heads and other debris for soup. Season the
shellfish with sea salt, black pepper and freshly squeezed lime juice. Toss
and set aside while you peel the mango and cut its flesh into crescent moon
slices.
Both the scent and the taste of the fruit should be lusciously rich. If it
smells as though wiped with a turpentine rag, abandon it and use a couple of
nectarines instead.
Mix the mango gently with the seafood and its juices, scatter with a little
chopped green coriander, and garnish with wedges of lime.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A charge card with a difference - A pioneering
approach to restaurants and their customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A low-key press release that may have enormous benefits for chefs,
restaurateurs and restaurant-goers throughout Europe, Transmedia Network,
based in north Miami, Florida, announced its first overseas licensing
agreement and the opening of Transmedia Europe's office in London's West
End.
The office will be opened on Monday by Edward Guinan III who spent the first
half of this year raising capital to buy the franchise and to establish the
company in the UK. During meetings with merchant banks in Manhattan and
London which have raised more than Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.60m) for this
venture, Guinan told me my articles on 'Lunch for a Fiver' had been in his
briefcase and helped convince potential investors that British restaurants
may be ready for Transmedia.
He provides this additional custom through a scheme which enables regular
diners to obtain a 25 per cent discount at restaurants which join his
scheme. The incentive for the restaurants is an offer of interest free
loans. These are repaid, not in cash, but from the extra revenue generated
by the diners on Transmedia's list.
The company was conceived by its chairman, Melvin Chasen, as a media barter
business in New York in 1984. After years in the restaurant trade, he
realised that although restaurants can be busy, popular and profitable, they
face difficulties raising money from the more usual lending sources, such as
banks. Even in a recession restaurants can secure initial funding in the way
short-lived musicals attract 'angels'; but many restaurateurs can offer
little security for capital to buy equipment, to redecorate or to advertise.
Transmedia's way of ensuring that its loans are repaid with profit is to
exchange its cash for food and beverage credits (called rights to receive)
of double the value of the amount advanced. These credits are repaid by the
diners on Transmedia's list who are persuaded to go to the restaurant by the
discount.
Suppose for example that the Happy Trout restaurant received Pounds 50,000
interest free for kitchen improvements. It would exchange this for Pounds
100,000 worth of food and beverage credits which Transmedia would sell to
its customers, each of which is issued with a special card.
These food and beverage credits are used up and repaid by Transmedia
cardholders. Having advanced Pounds 50,000 to the ABC restaurant, Transmedia
receives, via the credit card payments, Pounds 75,000 (Pounds 100,000 less
25 per cent), ensuring for the company a gross profit of Pounds 25,000, a
highly respectable gross margin of 33 per cent and a 50 per cent return on
invested capital. For the cardholder, the saving is 25 per cent on
restaurant bills.
Transmedia then becomes an advertising medium for the restaurant, adding the
restaurant's name, address and telephone number to those already on its
books.
There are nearly 2,000 restaurants listed in New York, Boston, Florida and
Philadelphia and franchised areas in New Jersey, Chicago, Washington DC and
California.
In America, the minimum advance to a restaurant is Dollars 2,000, the
largest so far has been Dollars 600,000. It will not advance cash for
restaurant openings but its staff evaluate applicant's risk factors:
location, capacity, pricing and style of cooking.
The company's own charge card (called The Restaurant Card) costs
dinersDollars 50 a year. There are no restrictions on how often the card can
be used and the net amount is billed to the diner's Visa, MasterCard or
Discover Card.
The only restriction on the card's use is on reservations for tables of six
or more, which have to be booked via Transmedia.
Back at HQ, a small staff monitors the sophisticated computer software which
handles up to 70,000 credit card transactions, tips and tax rebates a month.
It also monitors how quickly each restaurant is repaying its loan via
reclaimed food and beverage credits.
Once signed on, the restaurateur must remain with Transmedia for a minimum
of a year even if the credits are repaid earlier. After that the
restaurateurs can choose to take out another loan, and therefore stay on
Transmedia's restaurant list which now goes out to more than 170,000
cardmembers.
Transmedia's success hinges on timing - it received a huge burst of
applications after 1988 when the recession began to affect the restaurant
trade. The originality of the concept and the substantial discount it can
offer card members who supply its revenue (it has only begun to tap the
corporate market, signing up 5,000 Chemical Bank executives) have also been
crucial factors.
The real strength of Transmedia's operation lies in Chasen's understanding
of the restaurant business and his ability to buy extremely competitively
but still leave his suppliers, the restaurants, with a small profit. Most
restaurants aim to operate on a food and beverage cost of 40 per cent or
less. His aggressive buying still therefore leaves the restaurateurs with a
reduced profit to repay the company's advance. The extra business The
Restaurant Card brings sweetens the pill and Transmedia's newest ventures
into marketing links with airlines and a division that will combine its
participants' food purchases to obtain savings and group insurance should
ensure the restaurants' loyalty.
After eight years Chasen and Transmedia are an 'overnight success' and the
darling of various stock market analysts in America (the company has been
listed in BusinessWeek's top 100 Hot Growth Companies for the third
consecutive year). He met strong opposition at first and I fear that British
restaurateurs will react similarly. But this is one American marketing
concept that I hope becomes a success in the UK.

IT IS not every day that a new malt whisky distillery is set up in Scotland.
Indeed, one sees far more of them being mothballed or even demolished. It is
therefore particularly brave of Harold Currie, former managing director of
Chivas Regal, to want to set up new stills on the Isle of Arran, a Hebridean
island between the Mull of Kintyre and the Scottish mainland. There will be
no malt bottled before the year 2001, but for anyone interested, bonds' may
be bought at a cost of Pounds 450 each. These entitle you to a case of
Lochranza blended whisky 1998 (containing whisky from the new distillery on
Arran) and a case of the real thing in 2001. Inquiries to Isle of Arran
Distillers. Tel: 0290-52282. Fax: 0290-50177.

MICHAELMAS goose is back on British menus. Last year, a fair number of
Weekend FT readers were tempted to savour the pleasures of autumn goose,
considered traditionally to be even finer than goose at Christmas.
This year Goodman's Geese is rearing 400 birds which should be ready for the
table in late September and October. What is more, Mrs Goodman has agreed
once again, if so requested by Weekend FT readers, to cut the necks of the
birds in a manner suitable for making goose neck pudding. But this offer
applies only to advance orders for Michaelmas birds to be collected from the
farm or despatched by overnight delivery in September and October. Later in
the year, she will be too busy coping with Christmas orders to prepare goose
necks in this way.
For a copy of my recipe for goose neck pudding, write (enclosing sae) to
Louise Gordon-Foxwell at the Weekend FT. Inquiries and orders to Goodman's
Geese, Walsgrove Farm, Great Witley, Worcester WR6 6JJ. Tel. 0299-896272.

IT ALL BEGAN in my house with Gala, Gala Royal and Braeburn from New
Zealand. All three eat well and are useful for tiding apple addicts over
between one British apple season and the next. My objection is the sticky
name-tapes worn by each and every fruit. It is a nuisance far worse than
refrigerator magnets. Magnets may multiply overnight but at least they know
their place. Apple stickers get everywhere.
Now, the French, Germans and South Africans are at it and British growers
plan to join in this autumn - at the insistence, apparently, of supermarkets
which are reluctant to sell loose apples without individual identification.
The litter problem looks set to grow.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Fashion: The easy way of shopping
</HEADLINE>

WHEN THE catalogues start falling on the mat like autumn leaves it must be .
. . well, nearly autumn. Fatter and faster they are coming as mail order
goes booming on.
Those who enjoy shopping by mail, and ordering their entire autumn wardrobe
in one fell swoop, might find the new Next Directory just the job.
Whether you are looking for a pair of silvery earrings, some striped socks,
a casual shirt or a charcoal grey sweater, the Next Directory will have it.
In size and initial look it is rather like the bumper catalogues of old  -
fat, comprehensive and not all that discriminating. As it has increased in
size, it seems to have lost its strong identity - here is something for
everyone rather than a collection aimed specifically at Next man or woman.
Nevertheless, most of the essentials of the winter wardrobe are there: from
pinafore dresses to crepe fishtail skirts and sweetly-fitted cardigans - the
delicately knitted version at Pounds 39.99 looking to be a winner. Baby Next
is coming along nicely, too, with all manner of cute items for the toddler
set.
All the catalogue basics, from socks to bodies, seem excellently priced.
Ring 0345-100500 for details. If your tastes run to smaller, more edited
catalogues, then look out for Kingshill.
Launched earlier this year with a small collection of British designer
labels (Caroline Charles, Paul Costelloe and Amanda Wakeley) two new names
have been added for autumn - Georgina von Etzdorf (every fashion editor
surely has a von Etzdorf scarf) and Belville Sassoon (for evening wear).
For a copy of Kingshill, The British Designers Collection, tel: 0494-890555
or fax: 0494-866003. The cover price of Pounds 4.50 is refunded against the
first order placed. Be warned, though, that designer labelprices are
altogether different from those at Next.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Fashion: Making a late splash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST BACK from the costa or the plage with the feeling that this year your
swimwear lacked a certain je ne sais quoi? Somehow it didn't convey quite
what a splendid fellow you really are? Somewhere along the line it seemed to
miss?
It is hard for those who spend most of the year in offices and bundled up
against the weather to get it right for the few glorious weeks when the sun
shines and limbs are bared.
But swimming these days is more than just a holiday pastime, for some it is
an all-year-round means of keepng fit. Here Christopher S. Brown helps to
make sure you get it right . . .
SOME BATHE, others swim. Bathing requires little effort, is purely
pleasurable and often takes place on holiday in hot places in saline
solution. Swimming is different. It usually takes place in pools, can be a
year-round activity and is one of the best forms of exercise for overall
fitness.
Sometimes in pools, there are clashes between serious swimmers and
pleasure-seeking bathers, who often mistakenly believe they are swimming.
To enjoy either aquatic pastime you do not need to spend a great deal of
money. Unless you are going to a nudist beach or are joining a swimming club
all you need is a one item of clothing.
The choice is simple - it lies between trunks or shorts. Trunks give the
wearer the 'I know how to swim look' while shorts seem to say 'I'm out for
fun.'
When buying, chose a pair designed for swimming rather than sun bathing and
avoid some of the paler colours which may become transparent when wet.
Trunks are available in so many jewel-like colours that you are bound to
find a colour that suits you. If you swim regularly it is important to
remember to rinse your trunks each time, otherwise chlorine will eventually
perish the fabric.
Look out for the tell-tale white threads, a warning signal that it is time
to buy a new pair.
Most specialist sport shops now stock swimwear throughout the year -
Olympus, First Sport, Lillywhites and Sports Locker are worth visiting. All
stock Speedo products (perhaps the best-known swimwear company of all).
Sports Locker sells a variety of names that are less well-known in this
country including Gazelle, a New York brand, and LASC, unique to Sports
Locker, which produces excellent cotton/lycra mix trunks, more expensive
than Speedo but certainly worth the extra.
Shorts do have one real advantage over trunks - they are kinder to those
whose figures are in dire need of exercise and will give the wearer more
confidence when the time comes to take the plunge.
Although it is now early September, and many of the fashion shorts have sold
out, more and more shops are realising that swimwear is year-round business.
Winter holidays in the Caribbean and the Far East and the popularity of
cruises mean that swimwear departments no longer automatically shut when the
summer hols are over.
If you are looking for swimwear now your first stop should be Paul Smith,
which is still selling 100 per cent, black, cotton shorts in bermuda and
beach lengths and in beautiful photo-print designs.
Next might be a visit to the sports shops. Sports Locker has its own brand
shorts in nine bright colours and Olympus sells shorts in which the Speedo
logo appears only when the shorts become wet.
An even greater surprise, however, is at Asda, where the George Davies
collection includes strips, stars, stripes and spots at reasonable prices.
If you do start swimming regularly then both your eyes and hair will need
protection. Goggles will save your eyes looking as though they have
permanent conjunctivitis and a swimming cap and the use of a shampoo such as
Ultra Swim will stop your hair feeling like straw.

FT  04 SEP 93 / How to Spend It: Fashion at first-hand - Lucia van der Post
knows how to find fresh, unsullied design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE OF us who are privileged to see the work that many of our young
fashion designers produce are accustomed to the praise, the accolades, the
excitement that surrounds their college shows but are inured to the fact
that what we have seen on the catwalk seldom sees the light of day.
Somewhere along the line the ideas are watered down, the manufacturers fail
to follow up the fine words with solid orders and the students in question
usually disappear into foreign workshops or the large industrial combines.
If you have ever wanted to buy fresh, unsullied designs, straight from a
student's portfolio, now is your chance. Simpson of Piccadilly, which starts
a Best of British promotion on Monday, until September 25, will be showing
(and selling) the work of four young graduate designers throughout the
promotion.
In February Simpson invited colleges all over the country to submit the work
of their best students. A panel of fashion experts then sifted through the
entries looking for collections that would interest, inspire and, of course,
be wearable and thus sell.
The four students eventually chosen were overwhelmingly the most popular
choice. Two came from the Royal College of Art - Pearl Walton, with a
wonderfully romantic collection for women in velvet and suede, and Tim
Voegele with a chunkily masculine collection of tweeds and checks for men.
Karen Heverin studied at Ravensbourne College where and created a Red Indian
inspired collection for women - all lean,long lines in brown, navy blue,
rust and white.
Hema Mandalia studied at Nottingham Trent University and has produced a
collection of soft, tailored menswear in (mainly) gentle neutral shades,
although if there are any men out there who have been longing for a winter
coat in powder blue now is their chance - Hema Mandalia has made one.
Sifting through portfolios is relatively easy. Getting the clothes to the
shop-floor quite another. Simpson had to organise the manufacturing and the
students remained involved with manufacturers.
The results are there to be seen in Simpson and very colourful and desirable
they are, too. Pearl Walton's collection has been built around the theme of
the 'Butterfly Ball' - the 'Butterfly' design appearing on velour bodies,
silk shirts, scarves, suede jean and some marvellously sassy high-heeled
ankle boots. Pearl Walton's father, Steve Walton, an expert in photograph
printing, photographed peacock feathers and butterflies which were then
screen printed on to fabric. The result is a rich and colourful collection.
The men's collections are well worth a serious look. Tim Voegele has
mastered that difficult art of making men's clothes that are interesting and
innovative and yet are indubitably for real men. They exude a highly
attractive chunky masculinity.
While it is well worth visiting Simpson for the fashion alone, there will be
lots more to see. In conjunction with Country Living magazine there is a
range of British craftwork to look at - rocking horses, hand-knitted
jumpers, hand-painted furniture and the like - while on the ground floor
there will be designers and craftsmen from The Princes Youth Business Trust
selling and showing their wares.

FT  04 SEP 93 / How to Spend It: US mix to tempt the British palate - Lucia
van der Post enthuses over a new furnishing store
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT comes to home furnishings shops, Jeremy Sacher, chairman and chief
executive of Jerry's Home Store which opens on London's Fulham Road on
Monday, believes that size and proportion matter deeply.
'Too large and it is hard to retain a sense of identity and personality; too
small and you cannot give people enough choice. After much thought I have
come to the conclusion that the 5,500 sq ft we have here is just about
right.'
So there it is, 5,500 sq ft of brand new home furnishings, all on the site
of the old Paperchase shop which stood on the corner of the Fulham Road and
Pond Place.
Loosely based on US ideas and informality, Jeremy Sacher, who had spent
years working in the family business - Marks &amp; Spencer, in case you wondered
 -had come to the conclusion that no-one in Britain had quite the mix that
stores such as the American operation, Crate &amp; Barrel, were offering.
Anyone who has ever drooled over its products, as I did in its Houston
branch, and marvelled that so many simple, clean, well-designed goods could
be offered at such attractive prices, has to agree.
'What impressed me about Crate &amp; Barrel,' says Jeremy Sacher, 'is its wide
appeal. Strolling through the aisles, filling up their baskets, you see some
of the best-heeled and some of the less well-heeled people in town.' In
other words they are united by an approach to life more than by income.
Not that Jerry's Home Store is another Crate &amp; Barrel. 'What we have tried
to do is to choose things which will fit in existing homes. We are not
trying to do another Habitat.
'Habitat is still fundamentally about furniture whereas we are the reverse -
we will mainly be selling home furnishings, glass, tableware, accessories
and cookware along with some furniture.
'We aim to be moderately priced where we can be - and I believe in our
glassware and tableware our prices are second to none - but where we have to
be more expensive, as in the furniture, we prefer to charge more and sell
quality, rather than lower our standards.'
The result is a store with a clean, airy slightly transatlantic feel -
'Nantucket, rather than West Coast' - and a mass of really attractive
merchandise that ought to appeal not just to first-time home owners
(although it will, I think) but also to those whose homes and tables need a
little freshening up.
The glassware is outstanding - tumblers at Pounds 1.95 each, champagne
flutes at Pounds 5.95 which look like versions selling at Pounds 25 a time
elsewhere, blue tumblers at Pounds 3.95 each, large white wine ones at
Pounds 11.95 each. Tableware ranges from the fine East Hampton porcelain
photographed here to inexpensive sponge-ware at Pounds 2.95 a plate and even
less expensive earthenware at Pounds 1.95 a plate.
A 20-piece set of a particularly charming blue and white vine and grape
design sells for just Pounds 35. The cutlery, for those whose families have
failed to supply them with heirloom silver, is charming - ivory-coloured
resinated plastic handles and soft, rounded shapes and at just Pounds 4.50 a
time for the main pieces, Pounds 3.50 a time for the teaspoons.
The kitchen section is outstanding - really sturdy sieves and colanders, a
small but beautifully chosen range of saucepans, a collection of maple wood
products from Vermont (carving boards, bread-boards, salad bowls) and some
enticing foods.
Look out for pots of dipping chocolate (white or dark), for Running Deer
Ranch marmalade, for Sarabeth's preserves, for dips from Texas, for
Kousmichoff's of Paris fragrant teas and for the Williams-Sonoma range of
cookbooks on a theme (pasta, chicken, pizza etc).
Then there is the furniture. Here, it has to be admitted the prices do not
bring such a lift to the heart, but on the other hand the quality and
desirability levels are high.
The huge, squashy, slightly over-sized furniture exudes exactly the air of
inviting comfort that upholstered furniture should. They come covered in a
selection of Waverly Fabrics which range from the sweet prettiness of gentle
chintzes and toile de jouy to cool checks and stripes. Sofas range from
Pounds 875 to Pounds 1,350 (without the covering fabric), chairs from Pounds
525.
The rest of the furniture consists of two main collections. There are some
simple maple wood pieces - a sturdy rectangular table, either for the
kitchen or dining-room, some good chairs and side tables.
Adding charm and a touch of nostalgia to the whole is a sweetly traditional
range of French pieces from Provence - here are the buffet deux corps
(because it comes in two parts), the armoires de Luberon, the vaiselliers,
the chairs and tables and side-boards which grace the homes of the
bourgeoisie with breeding and taste.
h The furniture is stained in a range of gentle colours - soft green, grey,
blue and terracotta - and can only be bought to order. Prices it has to be
said are high, but then these are really craft pieces. All are beautifully
finished and the length finishing process involves four different
treatments. The vaisellier is Pounds 1,250, the armoire Luberon, Pounds
1,450, the buffet deux corps, Pounds 1,895.
The overall look of the store is eclectic and undidactic. Things have been
chosen because they please the buyer's eye and have a use and a place in the
modern home, not to fit some given design ethic.
There are things that are cool, streamlined and unaggressively modern but
then too there is the old-fashioned charm of the stained French furniture
and the easy comfort of the over-sized upholstery.
Somewhere in there is something for almost everybody. Only the most
determined traditionalist or aggressively fetishist design groupie would
come away from a visit empty-handed.
Jerry's Home Store opens on Monday at 163-167 Fulham Road, London SW3.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Travel: Romantic inspiration in Somerset - Christian Tyler
heads west and discovers what influenced Wordsworth and Coleridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRY, YOU tireless travellers, to define what is meant by 'a sense of place.'
Is it a view, a sound, a smell, a state of mind? Poets describe it,
musicians too - and, of course, painters who work out of doors.
In a walled garden in the west of England, with a wooded slope of the
Quantock hills behind him and the Bristol Channel invisible below, the
painter David Imms is as attached to bits of the English terrain as any
Aborigine to his song-line.
He was born in the near north and lives in the east Midlands. But it is to
the south-west that he goes to paint: bodies in the landscape, bodies as
part of the landscape, bodies fertilising the earth. After a week on the
millstone grit of Yorkshire he is grinding his teeth. 'I think I am happier
on chalk soil', he said in the matter-of-fact way of one stating a
preference for, say, Bournemouth over Bridlington.
And he is right about travelling west. There is some primitive urge which is
satisfied by following the path of the sun. As you race down the motorway
the grease and smoke of London are sloughed off, the sky expands, the light
and the air turn softer, the colours richer. The sea is perceptible long
before it becomes visible, and at sunset the clouds pile dramatically above
it to compose the mythical land across the water: Tir-na-Og.
In this walled garden in the west, part of the Alfoxton Park estate at
Holford in north Somerset, the sense of place is overpowering. It is a warm
enclosure of reddish earth and brick, quartered by box hedges and planted to
bursting with vegetables, flowers and fruit. It is alive with flying and
crawling creatures not seen since the pre-chemical age. 'Organic' is the
word they use, but the word is too sterile.
The Mad Hatter of Alice in Wonderland protested that to see what you eat is
not to eat what you see. In this instance the Hatter's logic is faulty: you
may see (or paint) your cabbage in the morning and eat it that night. Around
the garden live other attendants of the dinner table: the Large Black pigs
(Pavarotti and Domingo) behind the barn, chickens in the run, goats beside
the driveway and sheep grazing among the deer in the bracken above.
The landscape of Alfoxton Park inspired the early Romantic poets. Wordsworth
lived there in 1797-1798 with his sister Dorothy. At the same time Coleridge
occupied a cottage in Nether Stowey, three miles away, with his wife and
children. Their ghosts have in turn become imprinted on the place.
According to Dorothy, it was on one of their night walks that the Rime of
the Ancient Mariner was conceived and it was in one of the panelled rooms at
Alfoxton that Coleridge five months later recited the finished work to his
friends. Here, too, the poets collaborated to produce Lyrical Ballads.
Dorothy was an indefatigable diarist of Nature's effects in this corner of
England. Her words, as well as suggesting images to the two poets, convey
their own innocently uncontrived sense of place:
'April 2: A very high wind', she wrote. 'Coleridge came to avoid the smoke
(she means, presumably, of poor Sara's cramped kitchen); stayed all night.
We walked in the wood, and sat under the trees. The half of the wood
perfectly still while the wind was making a loud noise behind us. The still
trees only gently bowed their heads, as if listening to the wind. The
hollies in the thick wood unshaken by the blast; only, when it came with a
greater force, shaken by the rain drops falling from the bare oaks above.'
Rebuilt in 1710 on much older foundations, the house is now a hotel of
creaking floorboards, modest comfort and somewhat shambly decor; but it is
privately run, has an unfussily family feel to it - and wonderful English
cooking.
A sense of place can be learned by walking. But, as Dorothy says, it has
also to be learned by sitting and looking. This seaward slope of the
Quantocks handsomely repays a week-end's reflection.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Travel: Hopping about in the sun - A sophisticate's guide to
inter-island Caribbean travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS A bouncy landing. A difficult one, granted, but bouncy, and in a
19-seater that can be a bit alarming. Still, if the aircraft and passengers
shuddered a little, the pilot was unfazed. Applying reverse thrust with a
flourish, he piped up on the intercom with an almost audible smirk: 'Ladies
and gentlemen, we have just landed . . . for the third time . . . on
Mustique. Please remain seated, etc. I hope you enjoy your stay and take the
opportunity of flying with us again.'
Island-hopping is one of the great pleasures of the Caribbean.
Each island has a different, distinctive feel. You might be lucky and find
one that captivates you for ever - often this is a thing you know
instinctively, almost the moment you put your foot on the wharf or the
airport tarmac. It is easy to get from one island to the next now, and
combining islands can make a more satisfying Caribbean stay.
An hour on a yacht can take you from a busy city waterfront to a deserted
strip of sand and palms while a short air-hop can link tropical France,
replete with chic restaurants, with a slumberstruck cay. If you style
yourself a traveller, getting from one place to the next in tiny aircraft
and leaky local boats can be part of the fun.
Islands are really best approached by sea. You get the measure of them, as
they grow from a grey stain on the horizon to a steep-sided, forested
colossus looming over a tiny settlement. And there is a time-honoured feel
in cruising into a busy wharfside, so rarely experienced now because of air
travel. The Grenadines, of which Mustique is probably the best known, are
particularly good for island-hopping by boat because there is a large number
of islands within such a short distance of one another.
You may choose to travel by gin palace, but there is a lot to be said for
taking the local mail-boat, the MV Snapper, named after a Caribbean fish
rather than the over-large island mosquitos. The Snapper, an old Norwegian
ferry, works its way along the island chain twice a week, carrying
provisions, building materials, soft drinks, livestock and - presumably -
mail. I arrived at dawn and boarding was in process. The scene was of
theatrical and demonstrative West Indian chaos.
I made for an empty seat and found myself next to a goat wrapped in a sack;
only its head protruded. It cocked its eyes at me occasionally, appealing to
me in its bemusement and panic.
It is an hour's ride to Beguia, where you put into a charming waterfront in
Admiralty Bay. Beguia is perhaps the perfect pretty Caribbean island - all
the prettiness of a coastal Cornwall village transported to the tropics.
Past the T-shirt sentry, with her wares slung between the trees as though it
were washing day, you come to a waterfront path where lazy bars in old (some
new) wooden houses are hidden among the frangipani.
But this time I headed on for tiny Mayreau, where there is lazy island life
of a more West Indian kind. Life is hard for the 180-odd islanders, who are
fishermen or work for the government, but they are easy-going and extremely
welcoming. Mayreau is so small and isolated that electricity has not yet
reached it, but you can play dominoes by gas-light, or sit on Dennis's
wooden veranda while he plays the guitar.
Arrival in Mayreau is a novelty in itself because there is no pier big
enough even to take the Snapper, so I had to clamber down into a
coracle-sized lighter along with crates of Coke and the poor old goat in his
sack. He was lucky, though; travelling cattle are simply driven off the
side.
The Grenadine islanders have long been ship-builders. The master-builders
were from Carriacou, an island to the south of Mayreau. Getting there took a
ride in a puttering outboard with a studiedly silent lobster fisherman and
then a hop by local sailboat, but it was worth it. Carriacou has an
enchanting, sedated air, with superb coves and a string of easy-going bars.
Here you can try out the local rum, jackiron. It is extremely strong and has
the curious quality of making ice sink.
The ship-building industry has declined now, though there are still a few
hulls taking shape on the water's edge. As well as boat-builders, the
Grenadine islanders have long been smugglers. Boats from Carriacou travel as
far north as Sint Maarten in the Leeward islands, where they pick up goods
imported directly from Europe: wines, export beers, washing machines and
other white goods.
Carriacou has an easy airstrip in that it is straight and flat, but
occasionally you will find that the pilots make a pass before coming in to
land, in order to buzz cattle that are wandering on the strip. You might be
surprised to see cars beetling across it too - the island's road borrows the
tarmac for a while.
The little island-hopping aircraft, many of them Twin Otters, are jokingly
known as the island bus service. You cannot quite hitch a ride, but you will
find that if there is nobody to pick up or set down at a particular stop,
the aircraft simply flies on by. Certainly you should not expect a direct
flight; en route to your destination you might touch down at five or six
airstrips, each of them a different country.
Flying in this manner has an intimacy with the elements that you don't
experience in a Jumbo. Taking off is entertaining. Landing is another
matter. There is a pecking order of airstrips around the islands (Mustique
rates in the top 10). The second most hair-raising landing strip is on chic
St Barts, in an area aptly named the Plaine de la Tourmente. The problem
here is that there are hills exactly where you would hope the pilot would
make his approach - at both ends. The result is best described as a banana
run-in, close enough one end to pick the flowers and the other to read the
car-drivers' T-shirts.
But most fearsome of all is Saba, a tiny forested pimple in the Leeward
Islands. The airstrip is set on Flat Point (hardly flat, but the nearest
thing Saba has to it). It is 400 yards long - shorter than most
self-respecting aircraft carriers - and there is a 100ft drop into the sea
at either end. It makes Heathrow seem quite boring.

FT  04 SEP 93 / An insider looking out: Elon Salmon, a refugee from London,
adjusts to country life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELON SALMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COTHERSTONE is one of those villages in the north of England that postcard
photographers favour, and guidebooks tend to describe as 'quintessentially
English.' The fast-flowing River Tees marks the village's northern boundary.
To the south and west there are the moors - wild, vast and dotted with
isolated farmsteads. Barely five miles to the east is Barnard Castle, a
charming market town.
A refugee from London, I came to Cotherstone three years ago. I liked it so
much that I made a vow: no more wandering. From here it is straight to the
crematorium, when the time comes. I re-affirm the vow on my frequent walks,
when I am moved by the rural beauty.
A friend had warned me that villages were clannish and gossipy. To my
relief, I found Cotherstone to be neither. From early time the village has
provided a point of contact for the hill sheep farmers of the dales,
artisans, traders and professional people who have migrated there in
increasing numbers. As a result, evolving social heterogeneity probably
accounts for Cotherstone's welcoming character.
My own roots have been pulled out as many times as there are decades in my
life. Yet here I feel at home as much as I am capable of feeling at home
anywhere. It pleases me that a letter, however imperfectly addressed, would
reach me so long as 'Cotherstone' was legible on the envelope. I enjoy being
greeted with familiarity as I walk through the village. My ego is pleasantly
massaged by the thought that I am on chatting terms with farmers on the
village's outskirts.
On a summer evening the village looks its best: hay-stacks in the fields,
children playing, a mare grazing with her foal in a meadow. In the near
distance, the spire of St Cuthbert's church pokes the sky.
I see a neighbour approaching with his dog, someone I had assumed was a
native villager. But no, he tells me he is an incomer. 'I've lived here for
over 20 years and I'm still considered an outsider,' he says. I recall an
earlier chat with a woman who could boast of local antecedence from the
beginning of recorded time. She had made a point of distinguishing herself
from 'outsiders.' Were they trying to tell me something?
The question of identity has become blurred at village level, no less than
nationally. 'Quintessentially English' is now more evocative than
descriptive. Like Britain as a whole, villages have changed; in many,
outsiders often outnumber insiders.
My own credentials are modest but sound: I came down to the village from the
high fell of Baldersdale where I lived through two annual cycles of sheep
farming. I made friends among the farmers of the dale. Such credit as I have
earned filtered ahead of my arrival in the village.
The late William Golding, to my mind the greatest and most English novelist
of our time, wrote in an essay about Wiltshire: 'To be English  - and more
specifically, Wiltshire - is to speak English and be used to English ways,
nothing more.'
English ways? A very amiable gentleman-farmer whom I have befriended once
took me for an afternoon of rough shooting on his land. I missed a rabbit.
Fortunately, so did he. A ferret he brought along wandered off, heading for
the brush. 'Elon', he called, 'get that ferret, will you.' The nasty
creature lunged, missing my hand by a whisker.
The farmer invited me to a dinner party. I parked my X-registration banger
where I should not have; I brought a bottle of wine, an unstylish, misplaced
gesture (not the right wine at that); I wore an unsuitable suit because it
was the only one I had; and, after afters, I nearly tailed off with the
ladies when I was meant to stay behind with the men to smoke and discuss the
state of the world.
Not so long ago, the wisdom of the countryside had it that if you saw BMW,
Mercedes or Jaguar cars lining the village green, it meant that the true
village character was dying. Like many villages in the area, Cotherstone can
field a modest motley of luxury vehicles. But, far from malignant, the
phenomenon simply underscores the on-going change in British rural life.
I keep wondering by whom would my outsider neighbour of 20 years' probation,
who presumably owns an up-market car, be considered an incomer when a good
many of Cotherstone's present inhabitants have not lived here for nearly
that long.
By what authority are the boundaries of the 'outside' determined? Who will
measure the pupation period it takes for an outsider to become an insider?
In so far as these questions have significance, they surely touch upon the
complex and universal business of assimilation - which, as Golding suggests,
comes down to a voluntary act of will and individual temperament. In this
spirit I would happily submit to learning Cotherstone's ways; some of them,
anyway.

FT  04 SEP 93 / The unsung king of soap opera: Never heard of Reg Grundy? Oh
yes you have
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REG GRUNDY, an Australian with a neat grey moustache who has just celebrated
his 70th birthday, would not stand out in a crowd. He last did a newspaper
interview 11 years ago and hardly ever appears on television these days if
he can avoid it.
His name, however, is hardly ever off television screens around the world.
It should be well known to anyone who ever watches soaps, game shows and
mini-drama series - as long as their attention span includes the rolling
credits which end with the large initials 'RG.'
Reg Grundy is remarkable for his ordinariness - except for his collection of
Australian art, his enormous ocean-going yacht, his house in Bermuda, his
flat overlooking London's Hyde Park and the fact that he is the man behind
soaps (serial dramas, as he prefers to call them), like Neighbours and Cell
Block H, and game-shows such as Going For Gold or Celebrity Squares.
Then there is the sharp business brain that has created one of the largest
independent production empires in the world. In fact Grundy was an
independent producer decades before anyone thought of the term.
'In 35 years in Australian television there never has been a moment when you
couldn't see Grundy shows', says Reg, who long ago broke out of the
Australian market and invaded New Zealand, Hong Kong and the UK, and is
entrenched in France and Germany.
He has taken 'coals to Newcastle' by updating old American game-shows such
as Sale Of The Century and selling them back to NBC. Now Reg is taking on a
similar challenge by trying to export novellas to South America.
Grundy Worldwide, the master company based in Bermuda, controls 16 Grundy
production companies around the world and makes between 40 and 50 hours of
television a week. Rather than just licensing the formats, Grundy usually
remakes programmes using the nationals of the country involved - 'taking the
kangaroos and kookaburras out' is how he puts it.
But ask Reg what the revenues of Grundy Worldwide are, or how much he is
worth, and the answer is the equivalent of a game-show format he owns, I Got
A Secret. Given the number of hours of television that Grundy produces it is
likely that annual turnover is more than Pounds 100m, and as Reg owns 85 per
cent of the private company it is clear that not all the glittering prizes
are given away to the game-show contestants.
'He's a businessman who makes television by the yard,' says William G
Stewart, an admirer who produces and presents his own game-show on Channel
4, Fifteen To One.
Reg Grundy's first steps towards being a multi-millionaire were taken in
Sydney where, in pre-television days, he desperately wanted to get into
radio. He succeeded, and in 1947 covered the cattle and pig prices at the
Royal Easter Show for Radio 2GZ. Then he became a sports commentator for
Radio 2SM; he covered rugby league games, even though he barely knew the
rules, and reported boxing matches, including a world title fight with the
help of a How To Box book.
His breakthrough came as a result of a radio quiz programme he presented 20
hours a week called The Wheel of Fortune, a game not related to the present
television show. He operated the wheel and had to relay the replies of the
contestants himself because in those days broadcasting the other end of the
conversation was forbidden in case someone said something untoward live on
air.
Reg resigned - '15 seconds before I was fired' - for offering unsought
advice to the owners on how their radio station should really be run.
Unemployed, he approached Ken G Hall, an early power-broker of Australian
television, and suggested turning the quiz into a TV programme.
'I was the producer, the host, wrote the questions, got the prizes and
brought them in a station wagon. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't
know I was packaging programmes as an independent,' says Reg. He became a
businessman when he offered a second show to Australian television and found
someone else to present it.
One of the greatest influences on Reg Grundy was another Reg - Reg Watson, a
fellow Australian who had written British soaps such as Crossroads. 'His
contribution to my company cannot be measured,' says Reg. Watson had the
idea that you could make a drama out of ordinary people's lives; if there
was a villain, it was life itself. In July they shot the 2,000th episode of
Neighbours.
'It started slowly but it sent out an invisible signal to people out there
to come and watch me and they did,' says Reg who believes that one of the
reasons why it is such a success with teenagers is that children and parents
talk to each other in Neighbours and work out their difficulties and
misunderstandings together.
'Happy endings are important, aren't they?' says Reg. Reg Watson also
created Cell Block H about life in an Australian women's prison. No less
than 684 hours ran in prime-time in Australia and elsewhere.
The Grundy method of producing soaps or serial drama - he believes soaps are
slow-moving whereas serial dramas are much sharper, with higher scene counts
and more humour - involves almost industrial-scale production. Enormous
pre-planning and long runs means that five half-hours a week can be turned
out at Pounds 40,000 a time.
Ask Reg Grundy why the BBC's latest turkey, Eldorado, failed and he points
to basic flaws. It should never have been called that in the first place and
there had to be real doubts whether viewers would be interested in the lives
of expatriates in Spain.
'Neighbours, Coronation Street - these people have to earn their living
every day. I can understand the BBC not staying with Eldorado. I don't think
the whole concept was appealing to the audience,' says Reg.
He talks warmly about popular drama but gets animated about the arcane art
of devising game-shows that work and appeal to the audience. 'To create a
game-show with enduring qualities is the hardest thing I know in the
business. It's not that hard really to create a drama.'
Altogether Grundy says he has produced more than 90 games around the world;
some of them, more than 10 years old, are being recycled on American cable.
Grundy is not a clown desperate to play Hamlet: he intends to stick firmly
to the sort of television he knows best.
A gently-mannered man, Grundy come closest to passion when talking about
broadcasters who try to impose their taste on the public and by implication
look down their noses at the sort of programmes he offers. 'Life's tough
enough for most people. They don't need being told what they should watch
and what they should do,' says Reg.
He controls his empire from his base in Bermuda. Apart from the tax
advantages it is only 100 minutes by air to New York. In Bermuda he has his
own beach. He lives there with his second wife, who is much more famous than
him. As Joy Chambers Grundy she appears from time-to-time in Neighbours as
the character Rosemary Daniels. She has just published her first novel,
Mayfield.
For Reg Grundy, creator of serial dramas and game-shows and recently feted
in Australia for his services to television, it all sounds suspiciously like
a happy ending. 'I hope I haven't come to the ending yet,' says Reg, who
plans to take his programmes to lots more countries where long runs,
cost-effective production and ratings are important.
In recent years the bankers have started offering Reg his own pot of gold
for Grundy Worldwide. Maybe one day he will sell, he says, reaching a little
self-consciously for the title of another famous game show, not one of his
own: 'If the price is right.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / A very British ordeal: Summer Rites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS better to marry than to burn, as St Paul says. But it is worse to
marry and roast at the same time. At my own wedding, of fairly recent
memory, temperatures outside the morning suits were spectacularly high.
Perspiration levels inside the morning suits were downright unsightly.
Those of us who had crafted long and witty speeches watched helpless as many
in the audience melted away and threw themselves into a nearby
swimming-pool. Later my wife, wringing out her sodden raw silk drapery,
assured me that all was as it should be. According to her, the ceremony had
to have something of the fiery ordeal about it: a test of body and spirit,
from which we should emerge stronger.
She is right. Marriage as an institution may be getting statistically
evanescent, but weddings are still taken seriously. And by choosing to pitch
the ceremony at the height of summer, couples are compounding the chances of
making it a serious test.
I have noted various strategies for building unpleasantness into the
structure of a wedding. The first and most obvious is to hire a professional
photographer. Usually a slovenly chap in shirt-sleeves, for no extra charge
he will load his pockets with keys and small change so that he makes a
substantial jangle as he bustles about at the altar, dictating proceedings
far more authoritatively than the Book of Prayer.
He will do everything possible to embody that truism which Susan Sontag so
neatly states in her essay, On Photography: 'Having an experience becomes
identical with taking a photograph of it.'
As the cameras click and click, the coronation chicken nestles patiently at
the reception. l am not sure for whose coronation this odious sauce of
curried mayonnaise was created, but l wish it had abdicated from the realm
of the British buffet. There must be an 80 per cent chance of having it at a
summer wedding - along with a glass of some frothy potation stinking of the
hedgerow. Drink it to the dregs. It is part of the test.
The most subtle contribution to a difficult rite of passage comes from the
church itself. Many couples fondly suppose that they can fix up a
picturesque ceremony in the same little village church - Saxon tower, yew
trees, a lych-gate embroidered with roses - where the bride's mother took
communion one Easter in the late 1950s.
They can, of course. But the local vicar knows transient custom when he sees
it, and knows that God is not mocked by the photo opportunities of a
florally enhanced lych-gate. So he exacts a sort of vengeance.
He may arrange for bells to peal during the vows. He may pause
over-significantly when he asks if anyone knows why these two may not be
legally joined together. He may lengthen his usual homily on the sanctity of
human relationships into a tirade against the prevailing rates of divorce
and fornication.
The finest clerical revenge I ever witnessed, however, came from a Jersey
priest. He had evidently decided that if he was going to surrender a
pleasant summer's Saturday, he would do it in a grand way. He turned up
staggeringly drunk, and so garbled the institution of marriage that most of
the congregation came away doubtful if the couple at the front were indeed
bound by wedlock.
A final note. Just in case anyone has managed to get through the ceremony
lightly, and is licking his lips at the prospect of champagne not made out
of elderflowers, there is a niggling hurdle to be raised. Make all the
guests queue up to shake hands with the bridal contingent. If prolonged,
this can generate a really effective, utterly unforgettable experience of
pain and peevishness.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Despatches: A dictator's legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES GEARY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST things that catch the visitor's eye during the 45-minute drive
from Albania's Rinas Airport to Tirana, the capital, are the countless
pillboxes scattered haphazardly across the countryside.
Intended to defend Albania against invasion from the west, these domed
concrete bunkers now serve as children's playgrounds. Strewn everywhere, the
bunkers represent one of the perverse legacies of Albania's former dictator,
Enver Hohxa.
The communist party exercised absolute control over every aspect of life and
backed its policies with the clout of the Sigurimi, the secret police. Hohxa
ruthlessly cut his country off from all contact with the outside world. As a
result, Albania retreated to the furthermost corner of Europe's collective
unconscious - where it has remained.
Just 50 miles across the Adriatic Sea from Italy, Albania is, after Norway,
Europe's most mountainous country. Its landscape is stark, imposing, raw,
uncanny. The rugged coastline that fringes the Adriatic, from Durres in the
north to Vlora in the south, is breathtakingly beautiful. Still largely wild
and undeveloped, Albania supports a population of some 3.3m, almost
two-thirds of whom live in remote mountain villages where blood feuds and
bartered brides are still the norm.
With the economy a shambles and war still raging next door in former
Yugoslavia, Albania is unlikely to become a popular tourist spot any time
soon, despite its natural splendour. Roaming the broad, dusty avenues of
downtown Tirana, it was easy to see why.
Everywhere, I was confronted by graphic reminders of how Albania has fallen
into disuse. Without exception, all the city's buildings are dilapidated;
electricity and water supplies are interrupted daily, and donkey carts are
still as numerous as cars on Tirana's streets. I was told of one rural
hospital that had only a single light bulb, passed around as necessary, for
a total of eight rooms.
Armed with an Albanian-English-German phrase book, I ventured into one of
Tirana's nondescript book shops, keen to discover what foreign literature
had infiltrated the country since democratisation. Two of the authors whose
names were legible to me included Stefan Zweig and Graham Greene. Dashiell
Hammett was also generously represented.
However, all these books had been printed before the country's Quiet
Revolution in 1991, so that each bore the imprint of the censor. Out of
curiosity, I asked the girl behind the counter for a translation of James
Joyce's Ulysses. In a mixture of Albanian and broken English, she told me
that a translation of Ulysses did not yet exist and that, formerly, even
mentioning Joyce's name was liable to incur a minimum sentence of three
years' clink.
She then ducked into a back room and reappeared waving a book with 'Enver
Hohxa' embossed in gold on the cover. 'Hohxa, Hohxa,' she sneered, then
tossed the book onto a pile of old newspapers in disgust.
The next day I hired a driver to take me to Elbasan, about 90 minutes south
of Tirana over treacherous mountain roads. As we negotiated astounding
curves with seeming unconcern, I tried to focus on the gorgeous panorama: a
phalanx of jagged peaks stretching to the distance. As we descended the
mountain, I saw the city of Elbasan sprawled below.
Elbasan seemed to have tumbled down the mountainside and come to rest
randomly. Its main thoroughfare, deeply worn and rutted, was flanked by a
string of ramshackle huts from which everything from ice-cream cones to
panty hose was sold. This part of Albania was once its industrial heartland.
But, like everything else, the mining industry had slowly ground to a halt
because of lack of equipment and materials. All that remains is the vast,
decrepit hulk of an abandoned factory and a few cows grazing among the
ruins.
Back in Tirana, I heard of another aspect of Albanian patriotism. Over
several glasses of raki, Marion Sahatci, my host in the city, told me how
every Albanian was forced to become a master electrician. 'Before 1991, it
was strictly forbidden to receive foreign television broadcasts,' he said,
proudly displaying the confused jumble of wires that enabled him to receive,
illegally, Italian TV transmissions. 'But television was our only contact
with the outside world. We watched communism fall in Romania on Italian TV
and knew that the same thing was going to happen here. We just didn't know
when.'
After all religious institutions were closed in 1967, Hohxa often boasted
that he had created the first true atheistic state. But on the afternoon of
my departure I heard the muezzin's call to prayer resounding once again from
Tirana's mosque.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Computing: When figures count - Some better ways to monitor
price movements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY Saturday morning, I spend 10 or 15 minutes typing between 50 and 60
share prices and Financial Times indices into the computer program which
monitors our stock market portfolio. On quiet Saturdays, another five or 10
minutes are then devoted to looking at graphs and charts and ordering the
portfolio in various ways. It is time spent pleasantly and, I think,
usefully. I regard it as the investor's equivalent of talking to one's
plants.
Undoubtedly, though, I am under-using the power of both the computer and the
program. If I wanted to keep a daily record of price movements, or to
monitor a greater number of shares, or to subject the graphs to the process
known as technical analysis, typing the data would be too slow. There are
other ways of doing the job.
Getting prices in to a portfolio program other than by typing is a two-stage
process. First, you must get the prices from the outside world into your
computer. After that, you must spoon them into your portfolio program.
If you know your way around computers, you might be able to do the spooning
yourself. If, on the other hand, you would rather try translating Plato into
Chinese without loss of nuance than write batch files or configuring data,
you must use the links provided by your own particular portfolio management
program.
The necessary software to connect the program to the data source could prove
to be an extra expense in what is going to be a fairly pricey business,
anyway. And not all portfolio programs can accept automatic price updates.
So, if you have not yet put your portfolio on computer, and you think you
might want to go automatic one day, ask sharp questions before you buy a
program.
This whole subject, in fact, is one that calls for sharp questions. If
things are going to go wrong in computing, the frontiers where information
is passed from machine to machine, or from program to program, are the most
likely trouble spots. Be sure you know exactly what you are signing up for,
and what the supplier will do if things do not work as you expect.
For automatic price updates there are, essentially, three roads you might go
down, each with advantages and disadvantages. You could connect your
computer to the telephone lines via a modem and dial up the prices you want.
Or you could instal a card enabling your computer to receive teletext. Or
you could subscribe to a data service which will send you a disk, weekly or
less often.
The professionals use a telephone connection. The cost is usually high, as
much as several hundred pounds a quarter, but the information is
correspondingly good. The high cost is not due entirely to the rapacity of
the suppliers of price data: the stock exchange holds the copyright on share
prices and levies charges on anyone who distributes them.
To use the telephone lines, you need first to equip your computer with a
modem. In a few years, every personal computer will come with a
facsimile/modem. For now, it is an optional extra.
A modem might take the form either of a card to be inserted in the entrails
of your computer, or a small box which sits beside it. In either case, it
plugs into a telephone socket.
Once you have a modem, you will need to pay a subscription to the company
which provides your share price data and, of course, pay for the use of the
telephone line just as if you had made a voice call or sent a fax.
The Rolls-Royce solution is a subscription to British Telecom's CitiService
(BT claims that the majority of subscribers are private investors). I saw
this service demonstrated and it is wonderful. It opens the door to the full
Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system (SEAQ) for equities, gilts, and
London-listed overseas securities; and to Extel Financial, for unit trusts
and insurance funds. You can also have futures and options, exchange rates
and financial news.
You can sit there and watch your screen while it all happens, just like the
movies. You can use the Portfolio Manager feature to have your own portfolio
updated continuously, showing percentage gains or losses for everything in
it. You can even deal directly from your computer, via ShareLink. (And you
might be reassured to know that the first thing the ShareLink computer does
when it receives your order is to print it out on good, old-fashioned
paper).
The great advantage of a CitiService subscription is that it covers the
entire stock exchange. If you do not pile on the optional extras and can
restrict your use of the system to three or four minutes a day, the cost
could be less than Pounds 200 a quarter. If I were a college bursar or
trustee of a wealthy charity, I would insist on nothing less.
As another option, there are several companies, including CitiService again
and the FT's own Finstat, which allow users to make one brief daily call via
a modem to down-load (as we say) information. These services are cheaper,
but they are still out of the reach of many private investors.
I list several suppliers at the end of this article: if you are interested,
compare prices carefully. The deciding factor could prove to be the shares
which constitute the 'package' you are offered.
The other possibilities for automatic price updates, teletext and data
disks, are cheaper still and, on the whole, simpler. They are popular with
many investors. I will return to the subject in another article.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Signs of the tee-times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ENTREPRENEUR might harbour a sparkling idea for a new venture but good
timing is indispensable if he seeks an easy ride into company ownership. Ask
Chris Boxall. 'We think we have got the product right,' he says, 'but what
has gone wrong is the time it has taken to get everything organised and the
fact that it was a terrible time to set up such a business.'
Boxall, a 29-year-old chartered accountant with no interest in remaining a
professional bean counter, nurtured one of those ideas which spawns a little
niche enterprise. Since setting up CB Designs less than three years ago, he
has supplied more than 50 golf clubs with aluminium and stone signs, from
big entrance notices to individual tee markers which note the hole number,
par, yardage and recommended difficulty (stroke index). The little company
based in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, has just secured its largest contract
 -Pounds 30,000 for a series of granite boulders, on which maps of each hole
are etched, for the championship course at Valderrama, Spain.
On the face of it, CB Designs teed-off smoothly, raising sales from Pounds
30,000 in its first year (to April 1992) to Pounds 100,000 last year and
Pounds 91,000 in the first four months of this year. But Boxall found more
hazards than he expected and admits: 'I've learnt a lot of lessons.'
The company had difficulties with agents and distributors who either took no
interest in selling the signs or tried to snatch his ideas and set up in
competition. It took longer than expected to get the right quality of
designs while the recession also wrecked this year's performance projections
 -which bunkered the company's aim to shift most of its sales and profits
this year from direct marketing of signs to 'sponsorship.' This involves
offering signs to golf clubs at a very low cost but then taking all the
revenue from the advertising on these sponsored plaques. Fortunately, direct
sales, expected to be Pounds 100,000 for all of this year, are totalling
Pounds 77,000 in the first third.
Profits are hard to come by in the early years of a small business. CB lost
Pounds 15,000 in its first year and barely broke even last year. Boxall says
it will generate profit this year and he will be able to extract his first
salary.
He was working in France late in the late 1980s when the germ of an idea for
golf signs struck him. 'I thought it was a very good market served by some
very shoddy products,' he says. He tried taking a shot in France but failed.
'I found a distributor who already sold golf equipment. I think the guy
somehow took it up to keep me out of the market. He didn't do anything to
sell the signs.'
Deciding the UK, with its large potential market of 2,500 golf clubs, was a
better prospect, Boxall raised Pounds 20,000 from his family and set up in
Hertfordshire. He has since added an overdraft facility of Pounds 40,000
from a bank.
From the start, the company was handicapped by failing to offer competitive
signs. Switching sub-contractors cured this, Boxall says. More than 70 per
cent of sales are generated from aluminium plaques. The clubs send details
of its holes and crests and an outside pattern-maker produces a wooden
mock-up from which a mould is taken. A local foundry produces the castings
and painting is done by hand. Stone signs are etched by sand-blasting.
Large aluminium signs sell for about Pounds 200 and stones run from Pounds
85 to about Pounds 1,000. 'The ideal is to get an order for a large sign at
each hole and for smaller plaques for each of the three tees at each hole -
for competition, men and women,' Boxall says. Direct manufacturing accounts
for about 50 per cent of total business costs.
The company's information bible is the Royal and Ancient Golfer's Handbook,
which contains details of all the UK's golf clubs. This information has been
fed into CB's own computer base and Boxall claims that direct approaches by
letter, advertising in golf and greenkeepers' magazines (at a cost of Pounds
4,500 last year) and exhibitions (Pounds 4,000) ensures that someone in
authority at every golf club knows of its designs. 'Japanese-owned courses
have been particularly good for us,' he adds. 'They have the money and they
appreciate quality.' Courses with CB signs include the East Sussex National,
St Andrews, the Oxfordshire, Forest of Arden, and the Emirates club in
Dubai.
Market penetration, though, amounts to only 5 per cent of golf clubs. Boxall
blames this partly on competition from other sign-makers, golf club
conservatism and the recession, which sliced into club incomes. He concedes,
though, that he has occasionally found himself in the rough through faulty
stroke play.
A family friend, made an agent for Scotland, attempted to go into
competition using CB's own sign styles. Then, Boxall employed an extra
salesman who cost more than he generated. A system of agents set up to
locate companies willing to advertise on sponsored signs proved difficult to
run. And the contract for sponsored signs was drafted incompetently.
'We supplied some clubs with signs without getting sponsorship. For the
Cosby course in Leicestershire, only two of the 18 signs attracted
sponsorship. We've had to write-off the cost of that.' Indeed, the company
has recorded a loss of Pounds 7,000 on sponsored signs so far this year but
Boxall says the aim is to make a gross profit of 40 per cent and 12 per cent
net.
CB Designs offers signs for homes, too, and Boxall hopes contacts made on
the golf course will generate other commercial work. So far, the company has
pitched for just one of these, securing a contract to supply an insurance
company.
Boxall has his fingers crossed that a new idea will bear fruit. St Andrews
is thinking of selling, in its club shop, miniature tee plaques of the Old
Course holes. CB Designs would be able to supply the hardware for such
mantlepiece nostalgia.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Just forget the llamas . . . -
The image of Bolivian sweaters has been turned upside down by a venture
employing all the latest techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THINK OF Bolivian sweaters and you probably picture scratchy,
oatmeal-coloured creations with little brown llamas jumping across - the
kind of street market garment favoured by students and hippies in the belief
they are helping to keep Andean peasants off the breadline. But an American
couple has found that combining soft alpaca wool, ethnic designs and
techniques with modern colour dyes, styles and general know-how can result
in highly individual products sold profitably in boutiques and leading
stores world-wide.
Laurie Adelson, a specialist in Tibetan weaving, and Arthur Tracht, a Latin
American historian, met in Bolivia while researching weaving techniques of
the Aymara Indians - one of the few pre-Columbian native art forms to have
survived almost intact the 16th century Spanish invasion and which, to this
day, can be seen on the streets of La Paz. After writing a book for the
Smithsonian Institute, they decided to do something 'contemporary and
productive' with their amassed knowledge.
The result was Millma, an up-market alpaca knitwear company specialising in
ethnic design with not a llama or snowflake in sight. In 1983, they joined
with two friends - neither of whom had any business experience - to buy a
shop in a La Paz hotel for Dollars 24,000. They then began contracting out
work to local knitters and weavers. Ten years on, annual sales surpass
Dollars 1.3m.
It has not been easy doing business in South America's poorest country,
though. In their second year, inflation hit 24,000 per cent - which meant
money to pay bills and salaries had to be carried in suitcases or
wheelbarrows - and frequent transport strikes held up deliveries. Moreover,
order dates have little meaning in this part of the world. 'If something is
ordered for June 5 and it arrives in July, that's considered good service,'
says Adelson, ruefully.
Although labour costs were low, so was quality. After a year of getting
sweaters with one arm longer than the other or one shoulder higher, they
decided the only answer was to keep a constant eye on the work force. Tracht
and Adelson bought out their partners and rented space in an old colonial
house where they installed three hand looms and three manual knitting
machines, sharing a desk because there was no more money.
For the first year, they contracted a specialist in knitwear construction to
show them how to make sweaters. Then, they hired a New York designer to
translate their ideas into knitwear. Tracht explains: 'There were a lot of
sweaters in the market and we couldn't compete on price. We had to offer
something different in terms of design and quality and, for that, we needed
professional help.'
Initially, they dyed their wool using plant, insect and mineral dyes such as
cochineal and indigo. But, as sales began to take off, they were unable to
get sufficient supplies, while customers were not willing to pay the extra
cost. So, they turned to chemical dyes, which offer a far wider range for
their bold, geometric designs.
From the start, there was a lot of interest in Millma sweaters, but
expansion was hindered by the need to train staff and the difficulties of
raising finance in Bolivia. Tracht says: 'We had no contacts and had to beg
banks to get a one-year loan at 30 per cent interest with 90 days to pay, so
we decided to be self-financing and grow at a natural rate.'
They have now acquired a factory - formerly a plant for making light bulbs -
which illustrates the combination of first and third world which
characterises Millma. Adelson and Tracht work upstairs from offices of
stripped pine and comfortable white sofas with a large window overlooking
the shop floor.
Down below, row upon row of women - in traditional dress of multi-layered
skirts, brightly embroidered shawls and bowler hats - beaver over knitting
machines, stopping every few rows to manipulate the shape, colours or
pattern.
Each sweater consist of many pieces which are ironed, measured and then sewn
together, stitch by stitch, so there are no unsightly lumps or seams. The
remaining jumble of loose threads is then sewn in.
Millma's work force is almost entirely female, even the security guard. This
is unusual in Bolivia, where labour laws require that women work fewer hours
per week than men for the same wage. But Adelson says: 'We find they are
better workers and they really need the work.' The company now has 170 women
and 15 men on site and another 150 working from home.
The production process is complicated; each sweater takes up to 24
man-hours. And, at more than Dollars 100 a time, the retail price is not
cheap. But output has risen from 500 in the initial years to 18,000.
Around 90 per cent of production is exported - about half to Europe, where
the sweaters sell in the French Facconable chain and the German Pro-idee
catalogue, and half to the US, where a major client is the Nordstrom
department store group. They are also starting to break into Canada and
Japan.
Tracht believes the key to their success is the hands-on nature of the
business and the focus on design. 'We are constantly evolving and
incorporating new ideas from paintings, wallpapers and Bauhaus textiles, and
we don't look at the bottom line too much.'
While Millma's production is small compared with better known knitwear
companies, returns are good and sales are expected to top Dollars 1.5m this
year. 'We've found our niche,' says Adelson, adding: 'We never envisaged
anything like this. We just wanted to communicate our love of textiles.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Briefcase Special: Why dividends may prove taxing - A more
complex system of taxing dividends is explained by Maurice Parry-Wingfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE PARRY-WINGFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAXATION of dividends was radically altered by Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, in his last Budget. For private investors in particular, the new
system is much more difficult to understand than the one it replaced.
Unsurprisingly, the Weekend FT's Q &amp; A Briefcase section has received a lot
of questions on this topic in the last few months, including the rather
strange interaction of income and capital gains tax. In this article, I try
to explain the new provisions in basic terms so that readers will be able to
work out their own situation from the principles involved.
Let us start by reminding ourselves of the basic tax rules. The first slice
of income is covered by personal allowances (eg a single person's allowance
of Pounds 3,445) and reliefs (eg for BES investment); the first taxable
slice of Pounds 2,500 is taxed at the lower rate of 20 per cent; the next
slice between Pounds 2,501 and Pounds 23,700 is taxed at the basic rate of
25 per cent; and anything over this is taxed at the higher rate of 40 per
cent.
Capital gains add a certain amount of complication. In principle, however,
once the gains of the year, net of losses, exceed the annual exemption of
Pounds 5,800, they are taxed as though they were a top slice of income.
Consequently, if your net gains, after deducting your annual exemption, come
to Pounds 5,000 and your income, after deducting personal allowances and
reliefs, comes to Pounds 20,000, then the first Pounds 3,700 of your gains
are taxed at 25 per cent and the remaining Pounds 1,300 at 40 per cent.
After the Budget, however, the position is considerably more complicated. I
will start with those of you who - perhaps as a spouse of a breadwinner - do
not pay any tax or whose marginal tax rate is at the lower rate, and then
move on to those who are basic rate and higher rate taxpayers. I will
concentrate mainly on UK dividends as part of income.
I will also deal with the effect of realising capital gains (meaning, for
simplicity, gains arrived at after deducting the annual exemption). It will
be seen that the treatment of UK company dividends, together with the
treatment of capital gains where there is insufficient non-dividend income
to absorb the lower rate band, produces quirks.
The basic point is that a dividend from a UK company now carries a tax
credit of 20/80. This means that a dividend of Pounds 80 from a UK company
is grossed up to Pounds 100 and a credit of Pounds 20 is available for
offset against the tax liability or, where appropriate, to be repaid.
(Previously the rate of tax credit was 25/75 so that a dividend of Pounds 80
would be grossed up to about Pounds 107 and carry a tax credit of Pounds
27).
Non-taxpayers
If your income is fully covered by allowances and reliefs, an additional
dividend of Pounds 80 will use up a further Pounds 100 of those allowances
and reliefs and entitle you to a tax repayment of Pounds 20. Capital gains
(ie, as mentioned, gains in excess of the annual exemption) will be taxed at
20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per cent, depending upon the amount.
Lower rate taxpayers
If you fall within this category, an additional dividend of Pounds 80,
grossed up to Pounds 100, will be taxable at 20 per cent but fully covered
by the tax credit of Pounds 20, so there will be no tax payable or
repayable. Capital gains will be taxed at 20 per cent, and then at 25 per
cent and 40 per cent if they are high enough.
Basic and higher rate taxpayers
The fun starts where dividends, when added to other income, fall within the
basic rate band. Here you might think that a dividend of Pounds 80,
producing gross income of Pounds 100, would give you a net tax liability of
Pounds 5 - ie tax at 25 per cent less a credit at 20 per cent. In fact you
will have no liability because the legislation provides that, within the
basic rate band, the rate of tax applying to dividends is only 20 per cent,
not 25 per cent.
No doubt it was felt that the policy of reducing Revenue manpower would not
be helped by making inspectors collect trivial liabilities on dividends.
This treatment, once understood, is not particularly difficult to apply in
calculating your income tax liability. The real problem comes when capital
gains are taken into account. The draftsman of the new tax rules had to
decide at what rate to tax gains where dividends are taxed at the new
'dividend rate' of 20 per cent. His solution is best explained by looking at
the following four examples.
These show that dividends are taxed after other income, but where that other
income falls short of the Pounds 2,500 lower rate limit, gains take up the
remainder of the lower rate band so far as possible. This is a departure
from the principle that gains are always taxed as though they are a top
slice of income.
Example 1
You have enough income other than from dividends to absorb your lower rate
band of Pounds 2,500. Here your dividends are taxed as the next slice, at
the 20 per cent 'dividend rate' or at 40 per cent as appropriate; and your
gains are then taxed as the top slice, at the basic rate of 25 per cent or
at 40 per cent as appropriate.
Example 2
Your income consists entirely of dividends. Here your income and gains are
taxed in the sequence shown in the table.
This is illustrated in columns 1 and 2 of diagram A, which shows how your
income and gains are apportioned between the three rate bands in two
situations. (In this and all other examples, it is assumed that you already
have sufficient other income to absorb your personal allowances and
reliefs).
Example 3
You have non-dividend income but it falls short of the lower rate limit.
Here the position is the same as in example 2, except that the non-dividend
income uses up the bottom slice of the lower rate band, so that more of your
dividends and gains will be pushed into the other rate bands. This is
illustrated in columns 1 and 2 of diagram B, which are identical to those of
diagram A except that interest of Pounds 1,500 has been added.
Example 4
Your non-dividend income exceeds the lower rate limit. Here a different
approach is taken. Your income and gains take you through the rate bands in
the following sequence: non-dividend income, then dividend income, then
gains. This is shown in columns 1 and 2 of diagram C.
For the technically minded, I should mention that the legislation which
allocates income and gains to the rate bands provides that, for income tax
purposes, the basic rate limit is reduced from Pounds 23,700 to the extent
that capital gains use up any part of the lower rate bands. Since this does
no more than ensure that gains taxed at the lower rate are included within
the full basic rate limit, I have ignored it to be able to explain the new
system clearly. Foreign dividends
Finally, we have to consider the impact of foreign dividends. These are
treated in much the same way as UK dividends - including the 20 per cent
dividend rate where they fall within the basic rate band - subject to two
exceptions.
The first is that there will normally be overseas withholding tax to credit
against your UK tax, resulting in a reduction or even elimination of your UK
liability. The second relates to those of you who are not domiciled in the
UK. Your foreign dividends are taxed in the UK on the 'remittance' basis,
and accordingly the 20 per cent dividend rate does not apply - though it
does, surprisingly, for Irish dividends.
Conclusions
These issues are important, for two reasons in particular. First, the tax
treatment of dividends and gains is yet another example of the regrettable
trend away from the Lawsonian simplification of the tax system of the late
1980s.
Anything which makes it more difficult for you to work out your own tax
liability is retrograde. It causes unnecessary time and cost for you, your
advisers and the Revenue.
Equally important, if you do not know your marginal rate of tax, you are not
in a position to make informed investment decisions. Either you will make
the wrong decisions, or you will play safe and put your funds into a bank or
building society account.

GENERAL Portfolio Life Insurance has launched a Protected Equity Fund which
will be available across its product range, including life insurance and
pensions.
As with other guaranteed products, the fund will invest in cash and in
options on the FT-SE 100 Index. The cash is designed to ensure that after
three months, the unit price will have fallen by no more than 2.4 per cent;
the options will capture, on past experience, around 72.4 per cent of the
FT-SE 100 Index's rise. The FT-SE 100 Index does not account for dividend
income from the underlying shares.
Charges will vary depending on the product to which the fund is attached.
John Govett, which is managing the fund, takes 10 per cent per annum of any
increase in the underlying assets.
A guaranteed product is also on offer from the National &amp; Provincial
Building Society. Guaranteed Equity Reserve IV allows the investor two
options. Option A is 100 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over
five years (for basic rate taxpayers) or your money back. Top rate taxpayers
will get 80 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE; non-taxpayers 133.33 per
cent.
Option B gives the basic rate taxpayer 75 per cent of the Footsie's rise
with a guaranteed minimum gain of 25 per cent. Top rate taxpayers will get
60 per cent of the index rise; non-taxpayers 100 per cent. In neither case,
does the investor give any credit for the dividend yield on the index.
The minimum investment is Pounds 500. There are restrictions on withdrawals.
Abbey National is offering a range of fixed rate mortgages for house buyers.
The longest deal is a fix of 7.99 per cent (APR 8.4 per cent) until the end
of January 2000. There is a booking fee of Pounds 300 and a penalty of 210
days interest for early redemptions or capital repayments. The maximum loan
is 95 per cent of the value of the house up to Pounds 125,000; 90 per cent
over Pounds 125,000.
First time buyers can get 6.15 per cent (APR 6.5 per cent) until January 31,
1996, or 7.35 per cent (APR 7.9 per cent) until January 31, 1998. The
booking fee is Pounds 90 in both cases; there is a 90-day interest
redemption penalty on the shorter-term loan and an 150-day penalty on the
longer term loan.
The Leeds has also launched a range of deals. Existing Leeds borrowers
moving home can opt for a 6.99 per cent fix (APR 7.2 per cent) until
November 1, 1996. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195 and redemption premiums
are on a sliding scale from three months' to one month's interest.
Alternatively, existing borrowers can opt for a 1.75 per cent discount off
the variable rate (on loans of up to 90 per cent).
There is also a 'lifetime' fixed-rate mortgage at 8.99 per cent (APR 9.7 per
cent), which can range from between 10-25 years. The arrangement fee is 2
per cent of the loan, and there is a three month's early redemption premium.
First time buyers can opt for a 2 per cent discount off the variable rate in
year one, or a two-year deal, at 5.99 per cent in year one, and 6.99 per
cent in year two (APR 7.2 per cent).

SCHRODERS HAS become the latest unit trust company to launch an emerging
markets fund. The fund management group cites its worldwide network - it has
offices in eight of the emerging markets - as giving it an edge in this
increasingly fashionable area, writes Philip Coggan.
Emerging markets are found in Asia, Latin America and parts of Europe. They
are attracting investor interest as their economies are growing faster than
those of the developed world and they are starting to deregulate and to
welcome foreign investors.
Fund manager Giles Neville says that the fund will use a combination of a
'top down' and 'bottom up' investment approach.
'In newly emerging markets, it's picking the country that counts' he says
'but as the markets get more developed, stock picking becomes more
important.'
Schroders set up an offshore emerging markets fund in May 1992 and this was
19th (out of 167) funds in the international equity sector during the year
to August 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright.
The initial charge will be 5.25 per cent and the annual charge 1.5 per cent.
Investors who pre-register with Schroders will receive a 1 per cent
discount. The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000.
The popularity of emerging markets funds was illustrated this week when
Mercury announced it had raised Pounds 40m in three weeks for its new unit
trust, compared with its target of Pounds 20m. A 2 per cent discount is
still on offer until September 17; the normal initial charge is 5.75 per
cent and the annual charge 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000, or Pounds 50 per month.
Kleinwort has attached a savings scheme to its emerging markets investment
trust. The minimum investment will be Pounds 25 a month, Pounds 100 a
quarter, or Pounds 250 a year; the dealing charge will be 0.5 per cent. The
Kleinwort fund follows a strategy by which holdings in countries are reduced
after markets have enjoyed substantial rises; and increased if they have
suffered falls. Potential investors should note, however, that the trust
shares stand at a small premium to net assets.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Insurers under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPANIES involved in the home insurance market came under attack from
two directions this week.
A report in the Consumers' Association magazine Which? accused insurance
companies of making consumers pay for their own past mistakes, while Direct
Line, the telephone-based insurer, hit out at the huge amounts of commission
earned by building societies for selling home insurance to their customers.
The Consumers' Association said increases in claim rates for theft had
slowed, and subsidence claims had almost halved since 1991, but premiums
continued to soar.
'The insurers' return to profit should benefit consumers and not the
industry alone,' the association said.
Its figures, based on premiums from five of the biggest insurers, show
contents premiums more than doubling, and buildings insurance rising by
about 60 per cent since 1987.
Figures from the Association of British Insurers also show substantial
increases for buildings insurance, rising from an average of Pounds 108 in
1987 to Pounds 195 in 1993, while contents rose from an average of Pounds 71
to Pounds 114.
These statistics are from the government's family expenditure survey, which
records how much families spend on insurance, including if they have swapped
insurers or reduced the level of cover, rather than how much the price of
identical policies has gone up.
Direct Line, which aims to increase its share of the household insurance
market, attacked building societies for the amounts of commission they made
from selling home contents and buildings insurance policies, and argued for
legislation to protect the consumer.
'The status quo in this market is maintained by protective and punitive
action taken by building societies and by a lack of competitive information
from the industry,' the company said.
According to its submission to the Office of Fair Trading, the average
consumer will pay Pounds 3,000 in commission over the period he or she holds
household insurance policies.
Most are unaware of how much money goes to the intermediary as commission.
Up to 30 per cent of buildings premiums can be commission. Consumers are
easy targets, preoccupied with moving house, Direct Line said. It called for
disclosure of commission levels.
The report pointed out that while insurers had made consumers pay for rising
claim levels, they had not seen the benefit of falling costs, such as house
rebuilding costs, which have dropped 10 per cent during the last 18 months.
The company also criticised the building societies' practice of making
mortgage offers conditional on customers buying household insurance from
them, and discouraging them from changing insurers later by charging a fee.
The Building Societies Association's 1989 code of practice does not allow
mortgages to be tied to the sale of insurance products, except for special
packages, such as fixed rate or first time buyer mortgages.
The sale of such packages has taken off recently and now accounts for more
than half of new lending. Most packages oblige borrowers to buy insurance
products.
Some home insurance providers now use the quirks of the market as a sales
ploy, offering new customers who were previously insured through their
mortgage lenders a first year discount of about Pounds 25, equivalent to the
'administration fee' charged for switching insurers by many building
societies.
Direct Line said that existing legislation could remedy problems of
commission disclosure and compulsory tie-ins, but it had not been
implemented.
The Association of British Insurers dismissed Direct Line's submission as
publicity seeking, seeing no need for legislation.
'It is perfectly acceptable for lenders to offer package deals to consumers;
normally lenders are willing to do non-package deals as well  - it is up to
the consumer to choose.'
The obligation to buy insurance as part of a package was generally made
clear, the association said. Administration charges for switching buildings
insurance were justified as lenders had a lot at risk, and had to check
cover was adequate.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Newton reaps the PEP benefits - Unit
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT SHELTON says he manages the Newton Income trust in a very
conservative fashion. But that has not stopped the fund from being one of
the best performing Personal Equity Plans on the market.
About half the fund's near Pounds 180m under management has come from Pep
investors, and during the past year the trust's popularity with private
investors has enabled it to treble in size.
The long term record of Newton Income is certainly impressive. The trust is
top of the UK equity income sector over both the five and seven years to
August 1 with growth of 105.4 per cent and 273.1 per cent respectively
(offer-to-bid with income reinvested, source Hardwick Stafford Wright).
Over the three year period, it is 5th out of 106 funds and over two years,
it is 7th out of 107.
In October 1992, this kind of consistent performance earned Newton Income a
top AAA rating from Fund Research, the independent group which monitors unit
and investment trusts.
Ironically, in view of the praise and the new money that has flowed into the
trust, during the past year Newton Income has slipped down the relative
rankings.
The trust is placed 65th out of 111 equity income funds over the year to
August 1, although investors have still enjoyed growth of 27.1 per cent.
Shelton, who has run the fund since March 1986 (apart from a one year
secondment to Newton's finance department), says that the trust was caught
out by Black Wednesday, when sterling departed from the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism.
'Over one 24 hour period' he says 'we lost eight percentage points relative
to the market.' The Income fund, following its conservative precepts, was
not invested in the highly cyclical stocks that benefited most from the post
Black Wednesday rally.
The fund has remained cautious over the past year with a high weighting in
bonds (which have performed very well over the last year, as inflation and
interest rates have fallen).
Shelton says that the fund will generally outperform a static or falling
market, but that it will tend to underperform a rapidly rising market.
The objective is to outperform the All-Share over a rolling three year
period.
Newton follows a highly structured investment management style, with a
strategy committee chaired by founder Stewart Newton, deciding on the
important themes that the group will try to exploit.
Added to this 'top down' view are the 'bottom up' stock selections of the
company's 20 or so in-house analysts.
These views are condensed into three model portfolios, which are designed
for Newton's pension fund clients.
Robert Shelton then selects from the portfolios those stocks which most
closely meet the income fund's requirements.
However, he also buys other stocks which can exploit the 'themes'
highlighted by Newton's strategy committee; given the rapidly rising size of
the fund, the portfolio now holds 100-120 stocks.
The Newton investment 'themes' can be very general. The group has been
concentrating on monitoring corporate cashflow during the recession, which
has helped it avoid many of the problem stocks that have damaged the
performance of other income funds.
A high weighting in utilities has also provided a boost to performance.
'We have been heavily invested in water and electricity stocks, although we
have moved out of water in recent months' says Shelton. The fund has also
taken advantage of its ability to hold a portion of its assets overseas and
has, for example, a stake in the Italian telephone companies SIP/STET.
The 10 largest holdings in the portfolio at the moment are: gilts and bonds;
Nat West; East Midlands Electricity; Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank; BAT;
Unilever; TSB; Shell; BT; and British Gas.
Although the fund is in the equity income sector, Shelton says that yield is
not the over-riding consideration when picking stocks.
'At no time will we sacrifice capital for income' he says, stressing that
the ultimate aim is total return.
Another of Newton's investment themes is 'communications' and Shelton
accordingly owns a low-yielding stock such as Vodafone in the fund.
'We can balance the low yields on some of our stocks against the high yields
we get on bonds' he explains.
The fund's distribution, which is paid quarterly, was cut in 1991, but this
was due to the effect of the management charge being taken out of income,
rather than capital. The current yield on the trust, after charges, is only
3.5 per cent. That is below the yield on the All-Share, although equity
income funds are required to produce a yield which is 110 per cent of the
index.
That has been a common problem with income funds since equity yields fell
substantially and managements have taken their charges out of income. In
theory, Newton Income would need to be reclassified unless its yield
increases but the sector definition may yet be changed, given the widespread
nature of the problem.
The Newton income is not really designed for those who want a high running
yield. But most of its Pep investors currently reinvest their income and
should, in theory, not worry whether their return comes in the form of
income or capital gain, since both are tax-free.
They certainly ought to be satisfied with its long term growth so far.
Charges. The initial charge is 6 per cent (at the higher end of the unit
trust charging scale); the annual charge is 1.25 per cent.
The current bid-offer spread is 6 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000 or Pounds 100 per month via the savings scheme.
For the Personal Equity Plan, a monthly investor must put in a lump sum of
Pounds 1,000 as well as the Pounds 100 per month.

GLAXO, reporting full year results on Thursday, might sound more cheerful
about its prospects in the US following President Clinton's more
conciliatory message about health care reforms this week.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended June are forecast at around Pounds 1.65bn
against Pounds 1.43bn a year earlier. Underlying sales growth will be in the
low teens but sales of new drugs might be somewhat disappointing. A final
dividend of 13p is likely making 20p for the year (17p a year ago).
Cadbury Schweppes is expected to deliver results in line with management's
bullish assessments of trading in recent months when it reports first-half
figures on Thursday. Many analysts forecast pre-tax profits of at least
Pounds 160m, up from Pounds 126m last time.
Forecasts for Prudential, reporting on Wednesday, vary widely from Pounds
218m-280m pre-tax against Pounds 249m a year earlier. an increase in
dividend to about 4.5p from 4.1p is also forecast. Better life insurance
performance will be over-shadowed by further heavy losses on re-insurance.
George Wimpey, reports on the same day. Some analysts forecast a small
interim pre-tax profit, others a small loss, against a loss of Pounds 7.2m a
year ago.
Blue Circle should report on Thursday interim pre-tax profits slightly ahead
with the dividend unchanged. AMEC's interim pre-tax profits are likely to be
slightly lower than last year's Pounds 10.6m.
Following a recent trading statement, Hillsdown Holdings' results on Tuesday
will be carefully scrutinised. It said it would achieve operating profits of
not less than Pounds 80m but it has its work cut out to improve the
profitability of its diverse food businesses. Coats Viyella on Thursday is
forecast to report a moderate rise in interim pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 54m from Pounds 46.5m a year earlier.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: BES tax warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST UNDER 1,000 investors in Bulldog Premium Growth I and II loan-back
business expansion schemes, stand to lose tax relief following a warning
from the Inland Revenue.
The investors have been told by Charterhouse Tilney, the sponsors, that on
August 25 the Inland Revenue had taken 'the provisional view' that the
companies' shares were not issued before midnight March 15. The abolition of
loan-back BES companies was announced in the Budget.
The 960 investors in the Bulldog Companies have therefore been warned by
Charterhouse Tilney that they may get back only 75p for every 100p invested,
if they take the loan from Barclays bank. The deadline for take up of the
loan facility has been extended beyond the original September 15 date until
after the result of the Revenue's appeal against two other BES loan-back
schemes.
The Revenue is appealing against a High Court judgment reversing the
Revenue's decision that National Westminster bank's Homeshare scheme and
BZW's Gracechurch companies are ineligible for tax relief. The hearing is
not expected until October.
There has been a rash of new issues this week. Sponsors Capital Ventures has
launched three BES schemes. Cambridge Collegiate II seeks to raise Pounds
29.85m for Fitzwilliam, New Hall, Robinson and St Catherine's colleges. The
cash-backed contracted exit price is 122.5p, equivalent to an annual return
after five years of 14.3 per cent.
Queens' College Tenancies and Lady Margaret Options are both FT-SE
100-linked schemes. The first seeks to raise Pounds 17m for Queens' College,
Cambridge. The contracted exit price is 121p or investors can choose a
variable geared return of a minimum of 60p after five years plus 2.5p for
every 1 per cent increase in the FT-SE to a maximum of 40 per cent growth in
the index. There is a lock-in facility once the index rises by 25 per cent.
Lady Margaret Options aims to raise Pounds 17m this time to buy properties
from St John's College or Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge and is for those
with a more bullish view of the FT-SE. The fixed exit option is 121p or
investors can choose a 60p return plus 2p for every 1 per cent increase in
the index limited to a 70 per cent rise. The lock-in is at 35 per cent
growth.
The minimum investment in all three Capital Ventures schemes is Pounds
2,000.
Hodgson Martin is launching the University of Oxford Accommodation
Companies, the first BES offer by the university itself. The aim is to raise
Pounds 15m for accommodation to let to graduate students on an assured
tenancy basis. The exit price is 123p and the minimum investment is Pounds
3,000 (Pounds 2,000 for Oxford graduates, benefactors and staff).
Hodgson Martin is co-sponsoring an issue with Allied Dunbar to raise Pounds
17.5m for accommodation for St Catherine's Jesus and St Hilda's Colleges,
Oxford. Allied Dunbar Stockmarket BES takes a different approach to the
FT-SE linked schemes to date by promising to lock in 72 per cent of any
annual growth in the index and locking out subsequent losses. The minimum
return is 75p per 100p invested.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Hard choice for trust investors -
Differing yield calculations make it impossible to compare competing funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT TRUST investors are being forced to choose funds based on
vastly-differing yield calculations which, in many cases, make it impossible
to compare competing funds on a like-for-like basis even though the
underlying portfolios can be very similar.
This dilemma is now all the more acute for investors who have seen returns
from building societies plummet as interest rates have fallen since sterling
left the exchange rate mechanism.
Unit trusts investing in shares and fixed interest securities can now
provide higher levels of income than building society deposit accounts. But
because yields on unit trusts are calculated using such variable criteria,
investors have no way of knowing if a quoted yield will equate to the yield
actually received by them.
Ken Emery, technical director of Save &amp; Prosper, one of the country's
largest unit trust companies with Pounds 2.7bn under management, says:
'There are various permutations, which is why there's a problem. There is
definitely a need to standardise yield calculations. It's interesting how
unit trusts have similar portfolios but have different yields.'
With this in mind, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation
(Lautro) is investigating ways to impose a standard method of calculating
yields. It has asked the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds
(Autif) to provide proposed yield calculations for equity funds, cash funds
and bond funds.
The different methods unit trust companies can use at present to massage
yield figures include:
Calculating on an historic or an anticipated yield basis. Philip Warland,
director of Autif and chairman of the working party to examine yield
calculations, says: 'You can get substantial differences because companies
are using past yields, especially if they think future yields will fall. If
yields are going up, they can use future yields.'
Allied Dunbar says it calculates its yield by taking the estimated future
dividend payments over the next 12 months divided by the cash value of the
assets.
Boosting yields on equity income funds by placing assets in cash instead of
equities at different times.
This means unit trusts can quote yields for short periods which are higher
than yields on trusts with very similar objectives but with smaller
short-term cash holdings.
Yields will differ from trust to trust depending on which price is used to
calculate the yield. A fund manager can express a yield either as a
percentage of the value of the fund on an offer price basis or on a bid
price basis. The former will give a lower yield than the latter.
No rules exist to govern the stage at which a fund manager calculates a
yield. This means a yield can be expressed either before or after charges.
If after, the manager can decide which charges to be taken out of capital
and which should be taken out of income, again affecting the final yield
figure.
Graham Large, an independent financial adviser who publishes Income Fund
Analysis, a specialist survey of UK income funds, says: 'A standard method
of quoting gross yields is long overdue. If the numbers are to have any
value to prospective investors and their professional advisers, they must be
comparable, like with like.'
Large suggests that a common sense approach would be for every unit trust
company to quote a yield on an historical basis. This would involve the last
complete year's distributions, after expenses but before tax, as a straight
percentage of the present offer price.
The yield would fall as the unit price increased. As each new distribution
was declared and the last declaration fell out of the calculation, the yield
would be re-calculated up or down.
Large adds: 'Even this basis is not conclusive. But what has actually been
paid out for the most recent year is probably the most reliable guide we can
have, perhaps with the flexibility for the managers to publish a lower yield
if they know the forecast income is going to be lower in the year ahead.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Breaking down the costs of divorce -
The financial effects and legal implications of the decision to end a
marriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO in five marriages today end in divorce. One in five women and one in
eight men are divorced by the age of 33, according to a survey released this
week by the Economic and Social Research Council.
Those facing a marriage breakdown have to cope not only with the emotional
distress but also with financial disruption and increased costs.
One of the hard tasks facing a couple on the verge of divorce is the
division of assets and, in situations where one is financially dependent on
the other, deciding how much maintenance should be paid.
The Legal Position
Going to court can be a lengthy and expensive business but if an amicable
settlement cannot be worked out some people may feel there is no
alternative.
Unlike some American states and several countries, the law in England and
Wales does not stipulate precise redistribution of assets but is
discretionary.
'The law used to be that the parties had to be put back in the position they
were before marriage,' said Douglas Alexiou, senior partner and head of
family law at Gordon Dadds solicitors, which specialises in divorce cases.
'But that was impractical and now, the function of a court is not to punish
or to compensate but to redistribute fairly.'
The court will decide on apportioning the assets according to the length of
the marriage, the earning power of the husband and wife and the needs of the
parties. If a couple have children under 18, the court's main concern will
be with their welfare but it no longer decides on levels of child
maintenance.
The couple has to provide detailed information about their income and
assets, backed if necessary by documentation. Although wealthier spouses may
be tempted to shift their assets to a relative or friend in order to
disguise how much they own, Alexiou warns that this is not a good idea. If
the lawyers find out, the court will disregard the transfer and treat the
asset as the spouse's own.
Couples who have a pre-nuptial agreement are probably aware that these are
not enforceable legally.
Child maintenance
Levels of child maintenance used to be decided by the courts, but varied
widely as there were no standards to follow. Since April, a new system has
been operated by the Child Support Agency. It is designed for separated
parents claiming state benefits, but parents at all income levels can come
under its jurisdiction.
The agency uses a formula to work out how much the absent parent should pay
as a contribution to the child or children's upkeep, depending on both
parents' incomes and essential living expenses. The figure should be more
consistent than formerly. High-earning absent parents can still be taken to
court for maintenance above the agency's maximum assessment, to cope with
expenses such as school fees.
The child maintenance formula automatically includes an amount of money for
the carer. That could mean that even when a couple has made a 'clean break'
agreement, the spouse looking after the children could claim some
maintenance.
So far the agency is only taking on new cases, where there is no existing
child maintenance arrangement, but it will gradually take responsibility for
existing cases during the next few years. The agency is entitled to trace
missing parents using national insurance and Inland Revenue records, and
have maintenance payments deducted from their salaries if they will not pay
voluntarily. It can charge for its assessment and collection services. Legal
Aid
There are two main types of assistance for people seeking a divorce in
England and Wales: Legal Advice, also known as the green form scheme, which
provides what its name suggests, and Civil Legal Aid, for those preparing to
go to court. If your disposable income is Pounds 6,800 or less and your
disposable capital is Pounds 6,750 or less, you qualify for Legal Aid on
financial grounds but you must also show that you have reasonable grounds
for taking or defending a court action. The financial qualifying limits for
Legal Advice are lower.
The most common misconception about Legal Aid, according to Lyn Graham of
the Legal Aid Board, is that it is a gift when in fact it is a loan. If your
disposable income is more than Pounds 2,294, you will pay monthly
contributions towards the cost of your claim. If you are awarded money or
property as a result of the divorce, but your ex-spouse does not pay your
costs in full, you will have to pay what is known as the statutory charge -
an amount determined by the Legal Aid office to cover your costs.
If a home is recovered, payment of the statutory charge can be postponed but
it will incur simple interest, currently of 8 per cent per annum. If you
lose, the court will take into account your financial means in deciding the
level of costs awarded against you.
Financial planning
If you anticipate being worse off after the divorce, you should try to
assess your income needs. In most cases, it is the woman who is likely to
find it harder to adjust if she has been financially dependent on her
husband.
Fiona Price of Fiona Price &amp; Partners, London-based independent financial
advisers, says it is all too common for women to underestimate how much they
will need to live on.
'One woman was being paid Pounds 150 a month by her ex-husband with no
provision for inflation and though she had Pounds 60,000-70,000 in the
building society and felt well-off, she was spending more than she was
earning in interest. She had settled for something which she thought was
reasonable without realising that it was not enough.'
Price advises writing down how much you spend and what you spend it on in
order to be able to make a realistic claim and to make informed investment
decisions.
You should also close as quickly as possible joint accounts and destroy
joint credit cards, if you suspect your spouse may make use of them.
However, Price advises maintaining insurance policies until a settlement has
been agreed.
If you are covered for medical expenses or life insurance as part of your
spouse's employees benefits, you will lose these on divorce and will need to
take out policies under your own name.
A wife loses rights to any benefits from her husband's pension scheme on
divorce.
The courts in England and Wales have no power to transfer pensions rights
from husbands to wives but in Scotland pensions are regarded as part of
'matrimonial property' which should be shared fairly on divorce.
The Pensions Management Institute has recommended that courts divide pension
rights between a divorcing couple but the government has yet to respond to
its recommendations. Until it does, women should try to make savings
arrangements of their own during the marriage and try to get a divorce
settlement adequate to provide for their old age.

<TEXT>
DIVORCE is bound to affect both individuals' tax positions, and tax
considerations may also affect the division of assets in any settlement.
Some tax aspects should be borne in mind in the early parts of the divorce
process, as once certain key stages have passed, tax advantages may be lost.
This particularly applies to capital gains tax.
Paul Knox, a senior tax manager at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says
you should plan for CGT in the tax year of separation. Transfers of assets
between spouses living together can be made on a no gain/no loss basis, so
no tax charge is incurred. This relief is lost at the end of the tax year in
which separation took place.
Between separation and the decree absolute, husband and wife are still
classified as 'connected parties' for CGT purposes. This can cause
difficulty if there is any transfer of assets between spouses during this
period which would give rise to a capital loss. In these circumstances, the
donor can only offset losses from disposals made to the separated spouse
against other disposals to the same person, which can mean, in practice,
that the losses are wasted.
The matrimonial home is the focus for other tax considerations. Transfer of
ownership from one spouse to another should not cause any capital gains tax
problems, even after separation, because of the principal private residence
exemption, available for up to 36 months after the person making the
transfer has stopped living there. Even after 36 months there are some
concessions.
Liability for stamp duty is limited to 50p for transfers made in connection
with divorce.
Knox says one type of arrangement for the former husband and wife's home is
best avoided. This is where the divorced couple continues to own the
property in agreed shares, with one spouse and the children being allowed to
live there long-term, often until the youngest child reaches the age of 18.
When the property is eventually disposed of, the non-resident partner will
be faced with a CGT liability for the gain arising while he was not
occupying the property.
If one spouse carries on living in the home after divorce, but the other is
paying the mortgage, he will also lose his entitlement to mortgage interest
relief, which is only available on one's main residence. John Battersby,
personal tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, says that one more tax-efficient
way around this is for the mortgage to be taken over by the person living in
the house, who could then claim mortgage interest relief; maintenance
payments from the non-resident spouse could be increased to cover the
mortgage payments.
If the divorcing couple are older, potential inheritance tax liabilities may
become a concern. There is an exemption for transfers made between husband
and wife up to the date of the decree absolute. Restrictions may apply when
the spouse transferring the asset is not resident in the UK. Transfers made
after the divorce because of a court order are not seen as voluntary gifts,
and are exempt from inheritance tax, but transfers under voluntary
agreements are not.
Maintenance payments used to attract generous income tax relief for the
payer, but since the 1988 budget this has ceased to be the case. The bulk of
the maintenance has to be paid out of net income. However, the recipient of
maintenance payments, made under most orders or agreements since March 1988,
does not pay tax on them.
The spouse looking after the children is entitled to the single parent's
allowance of Pounds 1,720 in addition to the personal allowance. If the
children spend time with each parent in turn, they can split the additional
allowance. If each parent looks after at least one child of the marriage,
both will be entitled to the full allowance.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Markets: When August ended, so did the market's summer
holiday - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first three days of September, the stock market gave up a good
proportion of the gains it had made in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the last
day of the month, the FT-SE 100 index reached a new intra-day peak of
3115.1. Then the retreat set in: the index closed that afternoon at 3100.0
and had dropped by Friday to 3057.3.
It was as if investors had become aware that the market's performance in the
past month had led them perilously close to complacency.
There was a lot to be complacent about. During August, the total return  -
capital appreciation plus dividends - on the FT-SE 100 was 6 1/2 per cent.
In one month, investors had earned half as much again in equities as their
money would have earned in a year in an ordinary building society account.
That comparison was one of the self-reinforcing factors behind the market's
rise. Individual investors started to realise, says Paul Walton of James
Capel, that the years of high interest rates are over, making equities much
more attractive. This explained the Pounds 1bn a month inflow into unit
trusts.
Such investors were not the only people to whom UK equities have looked
attractive. Traders continue to report strong buying interest from abroad,
particularly from the US. Indeed, the day-by-day fluctuations of demand from
US investors had a marked influence this week.
On Wednesday, for example, weak transatlantic demand was one of the factors
pushing share prices down. On Thursday, US purchases of shares in the big UK
pharmaceutical companies, based on growing optimism that drug price controls
would not be part of Hillary Clinton's health-care package, helped slow the
market's slide.
Another important factor at work has been the summer's striking fall in
long-term interest rates. The yield on ten year gilts dropped again this
week, ending Friday at 6.81 per cent, down a fraction on last week and just
over half a point lower than at the end of July.
Even very long-term gilts are down to exceptionally low yields: they are now
just over 7 per cent, a level not seen since the Summer of Love in 1967. If
the real interest rate is 3 per cent or so (the level indicated by the
index-linked gilt market), investors are expecting long-run inflation of
about 4 per cent.
Is that a realistic expectation? The government would say it is too
pessimistic: 4 per cent is the upper end of its short-term target band for
inflation, and the medium-term ceiling is 2 per cent. Once the markets come
to terms with the 2 per cent figure, there is scope, on this argument, for a
further 2 percentage-point fall in long-term interest rates.
If gilts continue to yield twice as much income as ordinary shares, that
implies a one percentage point fall in the dividend yield on equities. Since
shares are currently yielding 3 1/2 per cent, such a move would require a
further 25 per cent rise in the equity market, giving scope for the FT-SE
100 to come close to 3,900.
Not surprisingly, not even the optimists among equity strategists are
mentioning such a number. After all, even 4 per cent inflation has rarely
been achieved since the 1960s; and few people still active in the City can
remember a sustained period when prices rose by 2 per cent price a year or
less.
Still, the working of this arithmetic explains why, despite this week's
setbacks, most analysts remain confident. The counter-argument, of course,
is that measured in terms of earnings the stock market looks expensive. Only
a handful of All-Share sectors have price/earnings ratios below 20. For
smaller companies, which have been the most spectacular beneficiaries of the
past year's rally, the ratio is well over 30.
Not surprisingly, these stretched earnings valuations make the market jumpy
whenever it looks as though profits are not making the recovery necessary to
justify such numbers. As Maggie Urry explains below, just such a frisson
occurred on Wednesday, the day of a profits warning from Tate &amp; Lyle, a loss
at Simon Engineering, and lower profits at Courtaulds Textiles. Those
analysts who believe the market ran ahead of itself this summer - like SG
Warburg's George Hodgson - are afraid that more bad news from companies
reporting interim results this autumn will push share prices down further.
Particularly vulnerable, say the Warburg analysts, are sectors such as the
banks, insurers, and cyclical industrial companies where underlying economic
trends do not appear to justify the expectations of profits recovery
currently priced into their shares.
Such unpleasantnesses aside, the next few months are likely to be dominated
by the party conferences and the Budget, events which until this year have
been kept apart by the cordon sanitaire of the Christmas holidays.
Now that they come in disconcertingly close proximity, investors are likely
to worry about the government's ability to contain its internal disputes;
and about the way those rows will affect the difficult decisions that must
be made about curbing public-sector borrowing. Kenneth Clarke is, after all,
the most political chancellor of the exchequer in recent memory.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Markets: Bottom fishers: avoid the dregs - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-standing investment theory is that it is far better to buy the worst
performing fund in a sector than the best performer.
A swift look at the UK Equity Growth sector seems to bear out the
hypothesis. At the start of September 1992, Guinness Flight Recovery was
bottom of the 146 funds in the sector, having lost its investors an
impressive 41.2 per cent over the previous year. Over the year to September
1993, the same fund was top of the sector, with a gain (offer-to-bid, with
net income reinvested) of 83.26 per cent.
Looking further down the tables, we find that Exeter Capital Growth is
third, having been 140th over the year to September 1992. And Brown Shipley
Recovery is 4th in the sector, a heady rebound from its previous position of
139th.
Conversely, if you take the funds that were in the top 10 in September 1992,
you find that two of them were among the worst 10 performers over the
following year.
But before you all race off to buy the worst performing fund in the sector
at the moment, (PC CAM British Growth) a note of caution. Doing the same
exercise over the 1991-92 period produced different results. Of the bottom
10 funds in September 1991, six were in the fourth quartile (lowest 25 per
cent) of funds over the following year. One of those was Brown Shipley
Recovery, 147th in 1990-91, 139th in 1991-92.
A more fundamental factor has caused the tables to reverse themselves over
the past year - Black Wednesday. Sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, and the subsequent falls in interest rates, have boosted those
cyclical stocks which tend to be held by recovery funds. The top 10 funds in
the UK equity growth sector over the past year include six with 'recovery'
and three with 'special situations' in the title.
In contrast, the year that followed September 1991, was similar to the year
that preceded it. Economic growth was still sluggish, interest rates were
still relatively high. Recovery stocks were stuck in the mire.
There are some good reasons why badly performing funds will eventually
rebound. One is that the fund management company will take action to revive
the fund, perhaps by appointing a new manager; an example might be Guinness
Flight Recovery, where Michael Beggs took charge in the summer of 1992.
A second, is that luck plays a fair part in fund management. It is not
unusual for someone tossing a coin to record three heads in a row; but if
they toss a sufficient number of coins, the result will eventually tend
towards an equal number of heads and tails. Similarly, fund managers may
'regress towards the mean'.
But the trick in 'bottom-fishing' is not a purely mechanical one. For year
after year in the 1980s, the worst performing funds were in the gold sector;
anyone who picked one in the hope of recovery was disappointed. Only in
1992-93 has a revival occurred with gold funds topping the one year tables.
All this has proved, however, is the volatility of gold investment; Mercury
Gold &amp; General is the best performing unit trust over one year and the worst
over one month.
Investors should also be aware that there are reasons why poor performance
might continue for a long time. One is that a fund manager might simply be
incompetent; another is that it is becomes progressively harder to manage a
poorly performing unit trust. As investors notice the poor performance, they
sell their holdings; the manager then has to raise cash to meet redemptions;
quality stocks (no-one will want to buy his poor-quality stocks). Thus, the
manager gradually gets left with the real dregs of his portfolio.
Bottom-fishing will only work if two conditions are fulfilled; the area is
sufficiently volatile, and the investor's timing is virtually perfect. The
consequence is that it is a highly risky strategy.
of bottom-fishing. However, since it involves individual shares rather than
collective funds, and limits itself to the blue chip end of the stock
market, it avoids some of the flaws described above.
As adapted for the UK, Michael O'Higgins's theory involves finding the 10
stocks in the FT-30 with the highest yields and then ticking off the five
with the lowest nominal share prices. In January, it selected Blue Circle,
British Gas, Forte, Hanson and Lucas.
Since we are two-thirds through the year, and the market has been reaching
all-time highs, I thought I would update readers on the progress of the
theory. Blue Circle is up 34.2 per cent, British Gas has risen 13.9 per
cent, Forte is 29.8 per cent higher, Hanson has increased 8.4 per cent and
Lucas is up 23.5 per cent. The average rise is thus just under 22 per cent,
compared with a 11.8 per cent increase in the FT-A All-Share Index over the
same period. And that understates the outperformance, because the stocks
provide a higher yield than average.
Of course, good contrarians will realise that, just because the theory has
worked in the past, does not mean it will work in the future and the same
five stocks would not necessarily be picked if the exercise was done today.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Markets: Medicine starts working for drug houses - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US drug stocks managed a half-hearted cheer on Thursday on news that
President Clinton wasn't about to impose price controls as part of his
planned health care reforms. After the battering they have taken over the
past 18 months, though, few expect US pharmaceutical and other health-care
stocks to rebound further soon.
Thursday's advance came as welcome relief after the unremitting gloom of
recent months: the healthcare component of the S&amp;P Composite index has
halved in value relative to the index as a whole since the beginning of
1992. News that the reform plan, details of which are due to be unveiled in
less than three weeks, would not peg prices in the industry helped to nudge
the leading drugs stocks up by as much as 5 per cent. Merck, the largest,
gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 , while the share prices of Pfizer
and Schering-Plough each rose by more than 3 per cent. Most drugs stocks
held on to their gains yesterday, though Merck lost Dollars  1/4 in early
trading.
However, drugs companies' earnings are not likely to see any early benefit
from the stance in Washington. While political control of drugs prices has
been only a theoretical threat, the companies have faced far more immediate
commercial pressures to hold down prices. Christina Heuer, an analyst at
Smith Barney Shearson, says: 'The problem is not Clinton, Washington or
politics at all. The problem is the market.'
Most leading groups have announced voluntary price restraints in recent
months, in part as a public relations exercise to head off the threat of
Washington-imposed regulation of prices. But such moves have also been a
tacit admission that the biggest buyers of drugs - particularly those who
buy through health management organisations to gain the clout that comes
with bulk purchasing - are demanding cuts in their health care bills. A
combination of political and commercial pressures could yet force drugs
prices lower.
The threat comes from the growth of discounting. Around a third of all drug
sales in the US are estimated to be made at a discount to bulk buyers, with
discounts regularly reaching 25 per cent and in some cases climbing as high
as 40 per cent. Washington's plans could eventually force drugs companies to
extend these discounts to all buyers. Health alliances, the name given to
the big cooperatives the Clinton administration plans to assemble to wrestle
lower prices from providers, will add to the pressures on prices.
Politicians are already asking: If discounts of up to 40 per cent are
available to some buyers, why shouldn't they be available to all?
Significantly, Washington made clear it that it would keep an eye out for
what it termed 'profiteering' in the health care industry. A politician's
definition of profiteering is usually very different from a businessman's or
a shareholder's, particularly if the industry concerned has few political
friends to spring to its defence.
Drug companies are also bracing themselves for a price war in the wake of
Merck's Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco Containment Services, the US's biggest
mail-order distributor of drugs, announced in July but yet to be completed.
Merck has made it clear that it will use the distributor to gain a greater
share of prescription drug sales, a process that will involve undercutting
competitors' prices.
Against this uncertain background, at least two other troubling factors have
hung over drug stocks. One is the slashing of tax breaks for manufacturing
operations based in Puerto Rico, confirmed in the Clinton budget package.
The move prompted Smith Barney to cut its estimates of net earnings in 1994
by 5 per cent, along with other analysts.
A second factor that overhangs share prices is the expiry in the near future
of a raft of US patents on prescription drugs. Tagamet, an ulcer drug
produced by SmithKline Beecham, loses patent protection next May, while
Glaxo's Zantac, the market leader, is currently embroiled in a legal action
over whether its patent should expire in 1995 or not until 2002.
The effects of expiring patents are not easy to predict, says Viren Mehta,
of Mehta &amp; Islay in New York. Patent expiry on Tagamet, whose US sales have
already flagged in competition with Zantac, could hit Glaxo's sales in the
US far harder, since it has more to lose. Also, the question of whether
prescription drugs are able to make a transition to over-the-counter
treatments - a move planned for Naprosyn, an arthritis drug produced by
Syntex, whose patent runs out this year - will have a big influence on
future income.

First Direct, the telephone banking arm of Midland bank, has introduced a
staggered interest rate charge for authorised overdrafts. Until August 31,
the authorised rate was 16.2 per cent (17.4 EAR); the change means that
those overdrawn pay 15 per cent per annum (16 EAR) up to Pounds 250 and 18
per cent (19.5 EAR) on borrowings above this amount. The unauthorised

Abbey National is launching a five-year fixed-return bond which guarantees a
return of 40 per cent gross or 30 per cent net after five years. This is
equivalent to 6.63 per cent gross per annum, or 5.14 per cent net. The bond
is aimed at people approaching retirement or anyone else expecting to become
a non-tax payer within the next five years, as they will be able to receive
the interest gross when the bond matures. The minimum investment is Pounds

<TEXT>
The Nikkei stock index closed up four days out of five this week, and hit a
new high for the year on Friday. Other markets in the region are hitting
all-time highs, but Tokyo's closing high of 21,116 yesterday is still a very
long way off the all-time high of nearly 39,000 in late 1989. The Nikkei's
most recent low point of about 14,300 was reached in August 1992.
The Tokyo market's sentiment was buoyant this week on expectations of a cut
in the official discount rate, which has so far failed to materialise, but
investors still hope for an easing of monetary policy with the release of a
Bank of Japan report on business sentiment next week.

House prices last month rose by 0.8 per cent according to
seasonally-adjusted figures released by Halifax, the largest lender.
Nationwide building society, which does not make seasonal adjustments to its

that prices were still lower - by more than 2 per cent - last month compared
with August 1992.
Halifax said that house prices have generally stopped falling but did not
rule out some month-on-month falls during the year. Nationwide also expects
house prices to have shown a 'modest' increase by the end of the year

FT  04 SEP 93 / Markets: Paradise is not quite here - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE interim results reporting season gets under way, stockbroking
analysts have their pens poised to adjust profit forecasts for this year and
next.
A serious reduction in earnings forecasts for the market as a whole could
put pressure on share prices, while a more optimistic outlook would underpin
the recent run up in the Footsie index.
The past week has seen a number of corporate results and statements, some of
which have been poor, while company chairman are reaching for adjectives
such as 'fragile', 'patchy' and 'fitful' to describe their view of the
economic outlook. There appears to be a dichotomy between corporate
statements and those from politicians and economists who talk of recovery.
A profit warning from Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, on
Wednesday, led to analysts cutting forecasts from around Pounds 235m to
Pounds 220m for the year to end September. Also on Wednesday, Simon
Engineering slumped into a first half loss of Pounds 52.6m and passed its
dividend, while Courtaulds Textiles' interim profits fell 16.5 per cent.
On Thursday Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, reported
sharply higher profits but the chairman said orders were slackening and
'confidence remains fragile'. Ladbroke profits were lower.
While this sort of news was coming out, the Footsie was retreating from its
3100-plus level reached the week before.
But it may be too simplistic to say that poor trading statements have led to
a fall in the market, although individual share price falls such as Tate's
drop of 25p to 375p on Wednesday and Bowater's 21p fall to 494p on Thursday
are included in the Footsie.
Mixed with the bad news were some encouraging signs. Vickers, the
engineering group, and Sun Alliance, the insurance company, returned to
profits, while others such as Cookson, Senior Engineering, Burmah and Rolls
Royce, Reckitt &amp; Colman, as well as Bowater, lifted profits. Even Courtaulds
Textiles chairman said 'we are basically bullish about the British recovery'
blaming the profit fall largely on continental Europe.
Rather than concentrating on earnings, many market commentators believe the
fall has more to do with receding hopes of early interest rate cuts.
Michael Hughes, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, says 'the
market is much more interest rate sensitive than earnings sensitive'. Nick
Knight, of Nomura Research Institute, concurs, saying, 'the market is 1 per
cent about earnings, and 99 per cent about the US long bond'.
Neither is cutting his forecast of earnings growth from the market as a
whole for 1993 and 1994. Hughes is forecasting a 15 per cent rise in
industrial group earnings in 1993, and has increased his forecast for 1994
from 15 to 17 per cent.
However, he says there has been a slight tendency by BZW's sector analysts
to mark estimates down a bit. BZW tracks the proportion of downgrades out of
total changes in forecasts for large companies. Since 1989, more than half
the changes had been reductions until May this year when upgrades exceeded
downgrades. Recently the trend has headed slightly lower again with
downgrades over 50 per cent again in August.
A contrary view is taken by Bob Semple, strategist at NatWest Markets.
Although not changing his earnings forecasts after this week's news, he is
warning that the market may start getting worried about earnings prospects.
He points out that companies can no longer guide analysts' profit forecasts,
leaving a greater margin for error.
Knight of Nomura is expecting 30 per cent growth over the two years, without
being specific over the split between 1993 and 1994. He says that the
benefits of sterling leaving the ERM last September, and the interest rate
cuts which have followed, were bound to take time to work through to
companies. 'This reporting season was the very first opportunity to see any
improvement in earnings. If there is a six month delay it is not out of line
with the logic. It is just paradise postponed.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / The censors who are fighting a losing battle: Sex has paled
into relative insignificance besides violence in the public view. Either
way, the tide could be unstoppable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER else 1993 has been, in the cinema it has been the Year of Violence.
It began with shock horror: Reservoir Dogs and Man Bites Dog leading a pack
of films that startled audiences with new levels of brutality. It moved on
to news reports of video game atrocities and sadistic computer pornography.
It took in a telethon on the future of censorship. And now the British
censor's annual report lies before us - large, exhaustive, and all but
bleeding into the carpet.
Do we live in a new media climate? Or is it just the old one, dressed up
anew? Thirty years ago, we had the Lady Chatterley trial; 10 years ago, the
video nasties. Today it is the violence of the real (helped by a horror year
of newspaper stories) side by side with porn from outer space.
Ever since the first fig tree was raided to cover our sense of shame, humans
have rushed to protect themselves from real or imaginary moral evils. In
1912, British cinema planted its own fig tree and named it the British Board
of Film Classification. Today that board no longer watches over movies
alone. It sits in the heart of London - Soho Square, the un-sunny side -
monitoring videos and video games and designing new fig leaves for things
once unimaginable: from down-the-telephone-to-your-computer erotica to
satellite delivery movies of sex or sensation.
Even sex, though, long the great bete noire of British fuddy-duddyism, has
paled this year before the blood and thunder debate. In a recent survey, the
British viewing public put sex (along with nudity and blasphemy) way below
violence (along with drug use and bad language) as a cause for concern. And
the Red Hot Dutch satellite porn furore now seems like a side-show in that
carnival of carnage many perceive as being 1993.
James Ferman is Britain's censor, and I sought him out after reading his new
report. Forty pages of measured prose in the face of the immeasurable, it
resembles King Canute's Report on British Tidal Erosion. But is there really
more screen violence than before? Is it bad for us? If so, can it - should
it - be stopped?
To the first question, Ferman says yes and no. He dismisses the handful of
movies that gave us that blood-dimmed New Year: quasi-underground oddities,
he says, including an Australian low-budgeter (Romper Stomper) and a student
film from Belgium (Man Bites Dog). He is more concerned about rising tides
of violence in two other kinds of film: those that everyone watches,
mainstream Hollywood fare like Cliffhanger (brutal kicking scene scissored
to secure a '15' certificate) or Jurassic Park (passed for parental guidance
after much thought); and those that young offenders most seem to watch:
movies where violence is ritualised.
'Kids who are violent are violent because they want power and control, if
only for that moment in which they commit their crimes, and kung fu and
martial arts film are ideal for copy-catting, for teaching a repertoire of
violence,' says Ferman. He tells of a convicted murderer he met at this
year's televised forum on censorship who said he had seen Enter The Dragon
28 times.
'He'd made all the weapons, all the flails, and he and his gang went out and
practised everything Bruce Lee did.' Not surprisingly, Ferman and the BBFC
have set up a Home Office-sanctioned enquiry, the first such in 25 years,
into the viewing habits of young offenders.
Ferman agrees there is still no decisive proof that films cause violence:
'Social science is an inexact discipline and human behaviour is too
multi-factorial. It's nature, nurture; it's what happened to us this
morning; it's how much we've had to drink.'
He claims, however, that there is evidence that films and television shape
violence. Example: the rash of incidents in which young victims were taken
to hospital with damaged eardrums after children had copied the seemingly
harmless 'double ear-clap' shown on a television soft drink commercial
(later withdrawn). Ferman himself insisted that such an ear-clap be cut when
it appeared in a mainstream Hollywood film seeking a '15' certificate, Kevin
Costner's The Bodyguard.
Decisions like that may seem the simple ones for a censor. You do not hand a
lighted match to a pyromaniac; ergo, you do not wave lessons in heedless
violence at young children. But do all of us need to be protected? Isn't the
clamour about children's vulnerability - deafening since the video nasties
furore of the early 1980s - sometimes used merely to shore up the censorship
system for everyone?
Britain itself is more censorship-prone than almost any other western
democracy. The BBFC's own report admits that the board is 'one of the few
classification bodies anywhere in the world that continues to cut violent
material for adult audiences.' Ferman is ready to defend this case by case.
To the objection that Japan is soft on screen violence, yet has a violent
crime rate roughly one-tenth of Britain's: 'Japan has a totally different
means of control. They use shame, not criminal law. In Japan, people don't
break the rules because it lets the side down.' And shame, he argues, is a
factor in the low rate of reported sex crime in France, renowned for its
laissez faire attitude to screen sex and violence. 'French women don't
report rape because rape is a shameful thing. Women in France are supposed
to be able to cope with sex and be mature in handling it.'
The US, by contrast, could be seen as God's gift to the censorship
lobbyists: they need only point at America's crime figures (astronomical)
and, in the same gesture, at America's appetite for screen violence (ditto).
Early this year, US film critic Michael Medved rode through London
publicising his book, Hollywood vs America, in which film and TV are blamed
for their influence on everything from drugs to delinquency, blasphemy to
bad parenting.
To enter this argument is to step into the jungle of words like 'deprave'
and 'corrupt' and 'desensitise.' On Medved's side, Ferman tells of a Chicago
professor he met at a conference shortly after the murder in Liverpool
earlier this year of three-year-old Jamie Bulger. When Ferman told him of
the headline-hogging furore there had been in Britain, the American said:
'You people should hold on to that reaction. It means you care. Here, there
are children killed every day and it never makes the newspapers.'
Urban America, we know, is a violent, de-sensitised place. But is it so
because of too many Arnold Schwarzenegger films? And how much less violent
was the US, rural or urban, in the pre-movie days of Wyatt Earp and Billy
the Kid and the Indian wars?
Some US commentators believe that graphic screen violence, far from numbing
or brutalising, can actually sensitise: that it sensitised the entire
American nation, for example, to the Vietnam war and brought it to an end.
Film-maker Wes Craven, creator of the gory Nightmare On Elm Street series,
claims that screen violence can be a way of understanding real violence and
of working it through psychologically.
'We're living in a world that's becoming increasingly visual and
revelationary,' he says. 'From the 1960s on, through the media, I was
witness to increasing amounts of explicit violence. In Vietnam, we were
brought pictures of things that had happened just 10 hours before: pictures
from My Lai, pictures from a napalmed village. Later, there were pictures
from the car bomb in Beirut, pictures of Bobby Kennedy lying on the
Ambassador Hotel floor, blood streaming from his head. We were deluged with
violent reality.
'The audience for horror films and films of violence is often young and
filled with all sorts of questions about what it's going to be like to be
adult, to be accountable in this mad world they're exposed to. They have a
need and a right to have that violence processed in a way that is formed and
entertaining and, to the extent that it's fiction, is 'safe'.'
But what of the potential criminal or psychotic for whom movies are not a
cure but a catalyst? 'There are people out there who will respond to
anything. They might react to a horror film or they might react to a woman
taking off her shoes in a bus. They might react to the smell of a McDonald's
hamburger. For the unstable person who's ready to go over the edge, the mere
breath of anything will do it and the responsibility lies with that
individual, however demented, or with the little sub-culture that created
him: his family, his community.'
Craven pinpoints here another area of the censorship debate. Why do we allow
censors and media authorities to sit in judgment on cultural consumption
habits that should be the responsibility of parents, if we are young, or of
ourselves, if we are adult? 'The children we're protecting,' responds
Ferman, 'are the very ones who don't have good parenting or a strong
community around them. It is the root of their problem.'
To the outsider, though, the solution looks just as suspect. Why look to
censors as substitute parents? These are people who, if we believe their
arguments about depravity and corruption, have been exposed to more
vitiating material than anyone else in the country. Are they morally
armour-plated?
Ferman: 'If one has critical viewing skills, one has a layer of defence
already. We at the board watch films armed with comparables from other films
we've seen; we take notes throughout the viewings. We don't watch coldly
like technicians because you can't: one of the things we're assessing is how
a film or video acts on the viewer, not just intellectually but viscerally.
But we also assess our own viewing experience in the light of the age group
for whom the film is intended.'
This sounds like an attempt to make a pseudo-science seem a science. It
leads to the question: what are the laboratory criteria for judging if a
film is harmful? Wilf Stevenson, head of the British Film Institute, another
body that watches over our screen culture (albeit more liberally), says BBFC
is almost alone among media watchdogs in the UK in having no published code
of practice.
'In broadcasting, you can't get out of the door these days for the volumes
of codes and criteria about what is or isn't acceptable. The board has
nothing of this kind. It says it wants to be free to respond to changing
climates of opinion. But if a decision-making body doesn't have
clearly-delineated criteria, it's impossible to discuss the issues with
them.'
From another viewpoint, as Stevenson himself adds, such discussions may be
obsolete, anyway, in a year or two. The technology of media delivery  - by
satellite to your TV, by telephone to your computer - is leaping so far
ahead of the resources of media monitoring that the BBFC might well be
readying itself now to hang up its scissors and red pencils.
Ferman nods in stoical recognition of the reality. 'What do we do if Death
Wish 2 or Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer is pumped in uncut from
somewhere over the Atlantic? Do we prosecute BT for carrying the signal down
its cable wires?'
If the BBFC is, finally, defeated by technology, are there resources left
elsewhere to fight corruption? Ferman joins Stevenson in championing the
role of media studies as a way of building critical defence mechanisms into
the viewer himself. 'I think it's the only hope,' Ferman says. 'You have to
create a society in which our schoolchildren can survive in a
media-saturated world, where there's less and less chance for intervention.'
For Stevenson: 'It's the key to a lot of worries. The more you understand
the mechanisms and the way people create movie images, the more you can
regard them as just another communication system.'
The danger with media studies, of course, is that the power to censor
changes to the power to censure, and that power is put in the hands of
another unpredictable bunch of opinion-formers: school teachers. Some
sceptics about censorship think today's real threat to screen freedom and
artistic self-responsibility comes not from the sex and violence arena but
from the storm-troopers of political correctness.
Says Paul Schrader, whose movies as writer or director have been lightning
rods for controversy, from Taxi Driver to The Last Temptation Of Christ: 'We
live in an age when people tend to whine and take a grievance and blame
somebody else for their problems. We have this heightened sensitivity that
people's 'rights' are being violated and you've got to be fair to every
party or minority. It's as if everyone has shed their thick skins as some
kind of evolutionary stage. The old censorship war was sex and violence
versus moral authoritarianism. Today, I think more and more, it's individual
freedom versus group dogma.'
New times, new scares. The only certain thing about censorship is that deep
down many people, including liberals, would hate it to go away. For what is
self-expression without the battle to self-express? Schrader again:
'Free-spirited people are always in the minority. That's the way it should
be. I'd hate to live in a world where they were in the majority. What gives
freedom its value is the fight to gain and to define that freedom.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / The Long View: Strength of the bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JUST short of three years the London stock market has risen by 60 per
cent, which amounts to a major bull market by any reckoning. One leg
reflected the lifting of the Gulf War threat, the next was triggered by the
UK's ERM exit. In between came a sharp setback, afterwards a period of
stagnation.
Now the market has entered its third and most dangerous leg as it seeks to
adjust to lower interest rates and the tantalising prospect of economic
recovery. The economic news is indeed promising, but share prices are no
longer fundamentally cheap as they were three years ago, when the yield on
the All-Share Index touched 5.85 per cent and the price-earnings ratio on
industrials was 9.7. They are relatively expensive, on a yield of 3.6 per
cent and a p/e of over 20 (possibly 17 1/2 on prospective 1993 earnings).
They might, nevertheless, become still more expensive in the coming months.
These normal fundamentals, however, do not count for a great deal at
present. True, company profits are recovering, and the half-year results
season now getting under way will give a hard indication of whether the
expectations of earnings growth of 15 per cent or so are realistic (so far
the picture has been rather patchy). But dividends remain in the doldrums,
having tumbled by 5 1/2 per cent over the past twelve months in aggregate
and, historically, the descent of the yield below 4 per cent has represented
a reliable sell signal, at least on a one-year view.
The reason why these numbers do not matter much, at least for the time
being, is that the stock market has been riding piggy-back on an even bigger
bull market in bonds. The total return on the All-Share Index after eight
months of the year has been some 15 per cent, but long gilts have done much
better, returning upwards of 20 per cent in combined capital gains and
income as the yield has tumbled by 1 1/2 percentage points to about 7 1/4
per cent.
This bonds bonanza is a global phenomenon, led by the US Treasury long bond
on which the yield has fallen from 7.3 to 6.1 per cent since January 1.
Strangely, US equities have benefited comparatively little from this
adjustment. Although the Dow Jones Average of market leaders has climbed by
10 per cent this year, on a broader basis (as measured, for instance, by the
US index in the FT-Actuaries World Index series) Wall Street share prices
have risen only by about 5 per cent. Instead of pushing up their domestic
stocks US investors have been seeking cheaper opportunities overseas, buying
Dollars 8.4bn worth of foreign equities in the first quarter, for instance.
Such statistics take a long time to emerge but the flood of dollars into
European equities has certainly persisted in recent months, serving to drive
UK share valuations close to those on Wall Street and generating a freak
surge in share prices in declining continental economies.
When international money sloshes about like this the dangers of valuation
errors can become acute. On the one hand, there is a tremendous opportunity
for companies to raise new equity capital even though their circumstances
may be inauspicious, as we saw with Rolls-Royce this week. On the other, the
prospects for attractive future returns to shareholders are correspondingly
poor.
Although valuation measures such as dividend yields and price-earnings
ratios are looking stretched in the London market, investors have been able
to draw comfort from the ratio of long gilt to equity yields, which at about
2.0 remains comfortably close to the middle of the normal range for the past
20 years.
Falling gilt yields have neatly offset the drop in dividends and the effect
of higher share prices. The alarm bells of 1987, when pre-crash the ratio
briefly topped 3, are not ringing in the same way.
But the yield ratio is an unreliable indicator at times of economic upheaval
because it depends upon particular circumstances of inflation, economic
growth and payout ratios. It is at quite different levels in other
countries: in Germany it has been more like 3 and in Japan usually between 5
and 10. It has also been very different in the UK in past time periods.
In the 1930s, for instance, the yield ratio was typically about 0.7, because
in non-inflationary conditions, when growth expectations were low, risky
equities were required to yield more than safe gilts. During the early to
mid 1960s, when there was more optimism about growth, but complacency about
inflation, the ratio was about 1.2.
Then, in the late 1960s, the gilt yield rose above 7 1/2 per cent and the
yield ratio climbed to just over 2. That was the period of the 'cult of the
equity' which led to an overvaluation of equities lasting several years, in
due course corrected by the disastrous mid-1970s bear market.
Now, a quarter of a century later, the gilt yield has fallen back below 7
1/2 per cent but the yield ratio shows no sign of retreating to 1.2. Once
again it seems that the capital market is finding it hard to handle a major
shift in inflationary expectations: global bond investors are seeing it
differently from global equity investors, and one group or the other will
surely be eventually be forced into a sharp adjustment.
Debt deflation would normally be expected to be associated with subdued
economic activity and with downwards pressure on prices (and profits).
Recent capital market trends appear, however, to assume an improbably benign
combination of low inflation and reasonably rapid economic growth. But I do
not want to be too gloomy.
The positive way of looking at all this is to say that conditions are now
favouring an unsustainably high valuation of equities, which could be
further exaggerated when European short-term interest rates follow long
rates down.
Investors should enjoy the party while it lasts. But finance directors may
enjoy it even more.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Designer materials offer new solutions to industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW AGE of designer materials is about to dawn. The materials behave in
startling ways - one form gets thicker as it stretches; another changes to a
particular shape at a given temperature.
Professor Colin Humphreys, of the Department of Materials Science at
Cambridge University, unveiled the 'Age of New Materials' at the British
Association meeting in Keele yesterday.
He said purpose-designed materials with special properties would dominate
the manufacturing industry and health care in the next century.
The plastic which thickens when pulled was developed by Mr Ken Evans, a
member of the engineering department at Liverpool University. It has the
same chemical composition as Teflon, better known as the non-stick coating
on frying pans.
Uses for the material could range from bullet proof vests that expand to
deflect incoming bullets to waterproof sealant using plastic that could be
pulled into shape and expand to create a leak-free joint.
Prof Humphreys said ICI, the UK chemicals company, has expressed an interest
in the material. 'Shape memory' metals which change form at different
temperatures could be applied as replacement tooth roots to expand firmly
into the jaw when they react to body temperature.
More prosaic applications could include windows for greenhouses that open
and close when the temperature rises or falls.
Other new materials have a range of medical applications. Artificial bone,
developed by Professor Bill Bonfield, of Queen Mary and Westfield College in
London, is now being tested in clinical trials to replace the cheek bones of
accident victims.
If successful, artificial bone could also replace metals in hip
replacements, avoiding the annual spending of up to Pounds 30m for the
thousands of replacement operations carried out in the UK each year.
Implants fail when the patient's bone shrinks away from the harder metal of
the replacement and the joint becomes loose.
A new plastic has been designed to create artificial arteries. It is
kink-resistant, micro-porous like a real artery and compatible with the
human body. 'A fundamental reversal in the relationship between human beings
and materials is taking place,' according to Prof Humphreys.
'Historically humans have adapted natural materials, for example extracting
iron from iron ore,' he said. 'Now it is possible to start with a need and
then develop a material to meet it.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Thomas Cook to end holiday discounts war: Truce declared
after 10% cut lifts bookings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK, the travel agents chain that last month threatened a price war,
is today to declare a truce by ending its 10 per cent discount on all
holidays.
Thomas Cook said yesterday that although it would still offer some
discounts, the 10 per cent cut on all holidays had served its purpose. The
chain said its bookings for summer 1994 were 700 per cent up on last year,
although it would not provide any figures.
Thomas Cook's 10 per cent discounts were followed by similar offers from
rival chains Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel. Lunn Poly said yesterday that
its 10 per cent offer was due to continue for another week, after which it
would be reviewed.
Mr Hugh Collinson, managing director of Airtours, which owns Pickfords,
would not say whether the chain would continue to offer 10 per cent cuts,
but added: 'We were not the ones who started this.'
The travel agents' cuts have been accompanied by keen price competition
among tour operators, who have also tempted holidaymakers with offers of
free places for children.
Thomson, the largest tour operator, said it had already sold 400,000
holidays for summer 1994. Last year, the company took until Christmas to
sell the same number of holidays.
Thomson attributes this year's strong start only partly to lower prices,
with holidays in Spain costing 10 per cent less than last year. Other
factors, it said, were rising consumer confidence and the UK's poor summer,
which had prompted many to book next year's holidays early.
Mr Collinson, however, said he regarded the price flurries of the past month
as a phoney war. He said that early bookers tended to be those with
children. Couples tended to book during the Christmas and new year period.
Although another price-cutting campaign is possible later in the year, most
of the large operators believe the rush of early bookings so far will enable
them to maintain prices until next summer. The large operators say they have
become more skilled at matching holiday capacity with demand.
The absence of a late price war for summer 1993 holidays has meant fewer and
smaller discounts for the large numbers of late bookers.
The purchase of travel agents' chains by the leading operators over the
years has given the largest companies greater control of the market,
allowing them to exclude smaller rivals.
Thomson has owned Lunn Poly for two decades, Airtours recently acquired
Pickfords and Hogg Robinson, and Thomas Cook has financial links with Owners
Abroad. Small operators have complained that their brochures are
increasingly excluded from retail chains' shelves.

FT  04 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a curious contrast between Schroders and HSBC, the company which it
advised in its successful bid for Midland Bank last year. HSBC's interim
statement on Tuesday ran to 36 pages; Schroders yesterday delivered three
sentences. No public company should treat its shareholders with such
contempt that it refuses a figure for pre-tax profits at the half-way stage.
The omission is worse when that company is worth Pounds 1.3bn and on the
verge of joining the FT-SE 100. Schroders' lame excuse is that it plans to
change all this next year when EC rules will anyway oblige it to reveal its
hidden reserves. By then, it promises to deliver profit figures with some
sectoral break-down even at the interim stage. But while Footsie membership
would bring no formal additional reporting requirements and the stock
exchange is apparently happy with its long tradition of secretiveness, there
is no reason why the bank could not already disclose figures which it has
readily to hand.
The truth is that Schroders is being dragged kicking and screaming into the
modern world of shareholder communications. A position on the lower rungs of
the Footsie is a dubious privilege for a company in a cyclical business like
investment banking. Institutions will add to their holdings when the company
enters the index, only to cut them again if markets turn and the company
drops out. The implication is a volatile share price, made worse in
Schroders' case by the large proportion of the company in firm family hands.
But having grown so large, Schroders may simply have to accept membership of
the club, and the glare of publicity which that entails. It should not be so
bashful when it has little except its strength to hide.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's decision to shed his interest in the South China Morning
Post looks pragmatic rather than part of a grand design. With the Post's
shares trading at a record high and the handover of Hong Kong to China
looming, the opportunity to take a handsome profit was too good to miss. The
prospect of running a daily newspaper after 1997 is evidently not to the
free-wheeling media mogul's liking. That will do nothing for frayed nerves
elsewhere in the colony.
True, cutting links with the Post might also get round political objections
to his involvement in TVB, the Hong Kong television company in which News
Corporation tried to buy a stake in June. But with control of satellite
broadcaster Star TV secured in the meantime, terrestrial television seems of
lesser importance. Although feeding TVB's library of Chinese language
programmes through Star TV makes perfect sense, that might easily be
achieved without an equity stake.
With so many deals struck in such a short space of time, Mr Murdoch is
making up for time lost in the straight-jacket imposed by the banks. If he
can resist the unnecessary deal along the way, so much the better.

FT  04 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's news on US employment will have done little to encourage those
looking for a sharp second-half rebound in the economy. The hope had been
that as consumers had run down savings towards the end of 1992, the weaker
growth earlier this year would prove merely a pause for breath. Domestic
demand has been reasonably robust, and the disappointing overall growth
figures are due in part to weaker economies elsewhere, which have resulted
in higher US imports and weak exports. Yet since the US economy is on a
slower upward trend than in previous recoveries, temporary setbacks can make
it look wrongly as though the upturn is stalling altogther.
If the Federal Reserve thus has little reason to raise interest rates, the
recovery is not yet faltering badly enough to provoke a further easing. With
monetary policy stable, equities are in a benign area. Earnings gains may be
low but that is preferable to higher growth with resurgent inflation and the
risk of Fed tightening. Rallying bond markets and the flow of funds from the
money markets may also drive the market higher despite the historically
stretched valuations.
Whether such fortunate circumstances will persist is another question. High
equity prices increase the risk of a sharp correction if growth stalls or
inflation resurfaces. In that context, the upward revision of growth figures
through the recession is interesting. It implies that the US output gap is
not as wide as thought, and capacity constraints may emerge. Other markets
have more room to expand, and more flexibility to ease monetary policy.

FT  04 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Halifax gets the habit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By severing its tie with Standard Life and stepping into the ring as a life
insurer, Halifax is treading a well-worn path. The links between life
companies and building societies are eroding steadily. With the outlook for
the housing market dull and deposit rates low, building societies have a
clear incentive to capture long-term savings for themselves. Since banks are
thinking the same, though, the market is starting to look crowded.
That points to a squeeze, although which of the life insurers will suffer
most remains unclear. Halifax Life will inherit 12m potential customers and
a strong brand image from its parent. Natwest's new life operation has made
a strong start this year for similar reasons. But while Natwest has farmed
out investment management to an experienced manager, Halifax remains coy
about its plans in this regard. Unless it can show a decent investment
record, the benefits of low-cost distribution through its branch network
will not work to the advantage of customers.
If the investment side can be cracked, Halifax and other high street
purveyors of life assurance have a strong hand. Full disclosure of
commissions and administrative expenses demanded by government may
strengthen it further. While Standard Life will sorely miss the business
sold through Halifax, it is well entrenched among independent financial
advisers. It is also large enough to develop a brand image of its own.
Smaller mutuals look more vulnerable. Among recent converts to
bancassurance, only Abbey National has thought it worth buying a mutual as a
way into the market.

FT  04 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond market finally pays off
for Dow

Wall Street
US equities resisted pressure from unexpectedly weak employment figures and
turned broadly higher yesterday, driven by new record-low yields in the bond
market, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 at 3,633.93,
though it remained down 7.30 on the week. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 was just 0.02 higher at 461.33, while the Amex composite was up
0.29 at 461.57, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.06 higher at 749.71. Trading
volume on the NYSE was extremely light, as investors drifted out of the
market ahead of the Labor Day long weekend.
Bond prices soared on the back of weak economic data early in the day. The
Treasury's benchmark 30-year long bond jumped 1 3/8 to 104 9/32 for a record
low yield of 5.94 per cent, following the publication of non-farm payroll
data for August showing that employment had dropped by 39,000.
Tumbling bond yields helped lift equities, which turned broadly higher after
posting mild morning losses.
Advanced Micro Devices fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 after the
company said that its engineers had been influenced by Intel's 386 microcode
while developing Advanced Micro's Am486SX microcode. Intel and AMD have been
involved in litigation concerning AMD's right to clone Intel chips for some
years. A California Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to review a ruling
granting cloning rights to AMD. Shares in Intel slipped Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 62 3/4 .
Another stock to fall heavily was Tootsie Roll, which dropped Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 65, a 12-month low. The company said that it knew of no reason
for the shares to fall so precipitately. Volume was 24,200 shares, four
times higher than the average in the thinly-traded stock.
Drug and healthcare stocks were among the most actively traded for the
second day in succession. The sector gave up some of its gains made on
Thursday, which had followed reports that President Bill Clinton had decided
against mandatory price controls on drugs as part of his health care reform
package.
Shares in Merck, which had advanced Dollars 1 5/8 on Thursday, eased Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 33. Other actives included Glaxo Holdings ADRs, down Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 18 5/8 , and Schering-Plough, Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars
62 1/4 . Bristol-Myers Squibb bucked the trend, adding to its gains on
Thursday by rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 3/8 before settling back to
Dollars 57 1/8 . United Healthcare fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended slightly lower in relatively light trading, ahead
of the Labor Day holiday weekend.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index fell 11.50 points to
4,125.59, for a loss on the week of about eight points. Advances led
declines 371 to 336, volume fell to 49.820m shares from 60.281m shares on
Thursday, and trading value dropped to CDollars 488.3m from CDollars 709.7m.
Nine of the 14 sub-groups ended lower, with golds off 1.88 per cent on index
despite a small rebound in the gold price. Mining, industrial products,
financial services and consumer products were little changed, while energy
issues were moderately higher.

FT  04 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Paris takes breather after scaling new
heights - The recent rally in equities has been driven by hopes of lower
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After scaling record heights in late August, French equities started
September by having a breather, and taking profits. Having gone over the
2,200 level earlier in the week, the CAC-40 index closed yesterday at
2,156.09, a week's fall of 1.3 per cent.
This may be just as well. If the market continued dizzily upwards, the
government of Mr Edouard Balladur might over-price its forthcoming
privatisation offers.
One of these is Rhone-Poulenc, whose president, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, said
last week that, given the economy's bad state, he could not understand what
was driving the market so high.
Certainly, the boom has been particularly spectacular since the end of July.
On the last day of that month, when the monetary crisis coincided with
settlement deadlines, a record FFr12bn (Dollars 2bn) worth of shares was
traded in just one session. The previous record had been FFr8bn on March 26,
just before Mr Balladur's conservatives swept into government.
During August, some FFr90bn worth of shares were traded, or three times the
level a year earlier. The CAC-40 index put on nearly 5 per cent in the last
week of August.
To the professed puzzlement of Mr Fourtou, the bourse seems to be reading
any worsening of the macro-economic news as simply accelerating a reduction
in interest rates. But the surge on the market has also been part of a
general boom on European exchanges, reflecting expectations that the
continental recession is now bottoming out and that, with the corset of the
European exchange rate system at last loosened, interest rates in Germany's
partner countries can be sharply reduced.
'The French authorities now have flexibility in their monetary policy,' says
Mr Piers Butler of Baring Securities in Paris. 'They have not used it yet.
But it is only a matter of time before prevailing economic conditions,
unemployment which is still rising and consumption which is still stagnating
obliges them to do so.'
Only a month after it emptied its reserves in a vain attempt to maintain the
franc's parity within an unchanged exchange rate mechanism, the Bank of
France is still trying to restock its coffers with D-marks at a reasonably
strong exchange rate in terms of francs.
But one minister particularly close to Mr Balladur says that the
government's new watchword in monetary policy is 'pragmatism', and hints
that once the central bank has replenished its reserves, it may well start
slicing official interest rates. One institution, the Caisse d'Epargne in
the Paris region, has already gambled on this by slashing three percentage
points off consumer credit charges to its clients last week.
Interest rate cuts would not only help equities directly by boosting the
share-issuing companies, but also indirectly by reducing the attractiveness
of competing investments, such as Sicav money market funds and bonds.
The Balladur bond issue brought in FFr110bn to help finance public works and
housing and to give the government bridging finance before it gets the
receipts from its privatisation programme.
Not only did 'Ballabond' subscribers finance their investment by moving as
much as FFr80bn out of Sicav funds, but much of the bond issue may end up in
equities because of the special provisions encouraging holders to convert
bonds into shares of privatised companies.
Some FFr1,000bn still remains in Sicav money funds. If only 10 per cent of
this were to move into equities, it would have 'a very considerable effect'
on the relatively small proportion of shares regularly traded, says Mr Marc
Loneux, head of research at Bacot Allain Warburg.
The summer boom pushed the bourse's market capitalisation to FFr2,335bn by
the end of August, according to Mr Herve de Laitre of the Societe des
Bourses Francaises (SBF) which runs the Paris market. But Mr Loneux reckons
that only about half of these shares, just over FFr1,000bn, 'float freely',
with the rest held long-term.
The Paris market has also drawn fresh interest from abroad, particularly the
US, in spite of the fact that foreigners already own a third of all French
shares. 'The British moved in heavily a year ago', says Mr Butler, 'but we
have recently seen more money arrive from the US where a number of
institutions are underweight in foreign, especially European equities'.
There is thus plenty of liquidity at the moment. With the government aiming
to get around FFr40bn for the sale of its stakes in Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) and of Rhone-Poulenc, 'privatisation will only soak up a part of
this liquidity this autumn', says Mr Loneux.
Whether the market will be able eventually to absorb smoothly all 21
companies on the privatisation list, worth a possible FFr300bn, is another
matter.
But if privatisation is an overall success, it would add 13 per cent to
bourse capitalisation, says Mr de Laitre, compared to the 5.3 per cent
increase created by the conservatives' last privatisation programme in
1986-7.
It should also swell the number of individual domestic investors, which fell
from 6m to 4.5m in the last year as people took advantage of high interest
rates attached to Sicavs.
The government has stepped in to help and has exempted investors from the
bourse tax on transactions of less than FFr50,000 and put a maximum ceiling
of FFr4,000 on this tax.
'It is another blow to this tax, which we hope one day will die altogether',
says Mr de Laitre.

register new highs

<TEXT>
THE Nikkei index hit a new high for the year as the second section debut of
DDI, the telecom company, encouraged sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
Buying by foreign investors and index-linked purchases took the Nikkei up
133.01 to 21,116.21; it opened at the day's low of 20,984.50 and advanced to
a high of 21,281.03 in the afternoon session.
Volume jumped from 364m shares to 480m, topping 400m for the first time
since August 13. Advances led declines by 576 to 448 with 169 unchanged and
the Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 4.69 to 1,698.67, a new
high for the year. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.07 to 1,305.07.
DDI saw strong buying interest and the stock fetched an initial price of
Y5.5m, sharply higher than its public offering price of Y3.7m. Its strong
growth prospects, compared to those of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
encouraged investors and the issue closed at Y5.41m.
Rumours that Yamaichi Securities would incur losses, because of irregular
sales of US mortgage funds, dampened sentiment in the afternoon. However,
strong buying supported blue chips and the overall index managed to sustain
its gains.
In spite of the popularity of DDI, NTT closed down Y14,000 to Y955,000 on
profit-taking. Yamaichi plunged Y19 to Y824. After the market closed the
broker said that it would pay up to Y10bn in damages to customers who
suffered losses due to misinformation by Yamaichi's sales staff. However,
other brokers were higher, with Nomura Securities up Y30 to Y2,200 and Nikko
Securities gaining Y30 to Y1,370.
Large capital stocks were lower on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y11 to
Y364 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y7 to Y683.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 75.68 to 23,035.67 in volume of 66.2m
shares. The index rose above the 23,000 level for the first time since June
11.
Roundup
THE region produced three new highs.
SINGAPORE registered its third consecutive peak, the Straits Times
Industrial index ending 19.80 higher at 2,041.67, 1.7 per cent higher on the
week.
Volume was 384.24m shares against 369.94m, reflecting further institutional
buying.
KUALA LUMPUR just maintained its winning sequence after Thursday's 3.7 per
cent leap, an afternoon rebound in core stocks lifting the KLSE composite
index by a mere 0.25 to a new high of 851.43, up 5.3 per cent on the week.
Activity was focused on second-liners, led by Idris which rose 44 cents to
MDollars 3.52 in volume of 89.9m shares.
MANILA, once again, saw Wall Street strength in PLDT and followed it through
to a new high, the composite index gaining 35.03 at 1,877.75, up 3.5 per
cent on the week.
PLDT rose by Dollars 4 to Dollars 49 3/8 in New York, but hit profit-taking
at home where it settled 55 pesos higher at 1,360.
HONG KONG survived profit-taking to close with the Hang Seng index 18.68
higher at 7,512.13, 1.2 per cent better on the week.
Demand focused on defensive stocks like China Gas, which rose 20 cents to
HKDollars 14.80 and China Light, up 25 cents to HKDollars 43.25.
TAIWAN dropped 1.2 per cent to a six-month low in thin turnover, the
weighted index closing 45.58 down at 3,817.12, 2.6 per cent lower on the
week on poor corporate earnings prospects.
AUSTRALIA was hit by the slide in the Australian dollar and bullion prices,
the All Ordinaries index closing 16.4 down at 1,952.0, up a fraction on the
week.
News Corp stood out in the weak market, soaring 40 cents to ADollars 10.20
on reports that it was selling the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.
However, the golds index tumbled 85.6 to 2,030.3.

FT  04 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Devaluation talk lifts
Brussels out of the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE phenomenon of the day was the leap in Belgian equities, after a so-so
week and a poor late August, writes Our Markets Staff.
BRUSSELS took hold of the view that a devaluation of the Belgian franc was
imminent, and the Bel-20 index rose 35.14 to 1,350.64, a rise both on the
day and the week of 2.6 per cent. Turnover was heavy at BFr3.3bn.
Mr Sebastian Scotney, Belgian specialist at Dillon Read, said that with the
sharp rise in domestic interest rates in recent days and a fundamentally
weak currency, it was a question of how long the authorities could continue
to hold out against the pressure for devaluation.
Other factors contributing to the gains, Mr Scotney added, on what was also
the start of the new account, included the fact the market had
underperformed the rest of continental Europe by some 7 per cent since the
middle of August and was attractive to foreign institutions.
Cyclicals showed the strongest rises, with CMB, the shipping group, up BFr45
to BFr2,090 in heavy volume while Societe Generale de Belgique added BFr165
or 6.6 per cent to BFr2,680.
AMSTERDAM saw a sharp decline late in the session as a weaker dollar weighed
on the market. Profit-taking was also much in evidence as the view took hold
that a correction from recent high levels was desirable. The CBS Tendency
index closed off 1.8 or 1.4 per cent at 127.7, barely changed on the week.
Chemical groups lost ground, with Akzo down Fl 4.20 to FL 172.00 and DSM Fl
2.00 at Fl 93.20; elsewhere, Royal Dutch fell Fl 2.70 to Fl 184.20 and
Unilever Fl 3.80 to Fl 198.00.
Nedlloyd surprised with one of the few gains on the day, up Fl 1.20 to Fl
48.50, with traders unable to suggest an explanation, particularly in view
of the shipping and road haulage group's recently disappointing interim
results.
FRANKFURT ended flat as the big three chemicals stocks looked at the weaker
dollar, and decided that Thursday's gains were going to be short-lived. The
DAX index eased 0.46 to 1,925.16, 1.1 per cent higher on the week, as BASF
and Hoechst fell by DM4 to DM254 and DM274.50, and Bayer by DM3.40 to
DM303.60.
Turnover rose from DM7.9bn to DM8.6bn. On chemicals, brokers said that the
market had also returned to consideration of their recession-hit, second
quarter figures, issued last week and on Monday. Something similar seemed to
happen to Linde, the engineer, down DM11 to DM794 on the day, and by DM46 on
the week after a fall in profits on Tuesday.
There were bright spots. Porsche, the sports car maker, rose DM14 to DM644
after it said that it was reorganising its marketing structure and using
more aggressive sales methods. Still in the transport field, hopes of a
cooperation accord with a US partner and of a successful conclusion to talks
on a US/German aviation agreement boosted Lufthansa, which closed DM4.90
higher at DM158.70.
ZURICH extended Thursday's profit taking in banks, and spread it into
chemicals as the dollar began to weaken. UBS bearers topped the active list
and fell SFr22 to SFr1,155, SBC came along with a fall of SFr11 to SFr462
and the SMI index lost 25.0 at 2,438.8.
The loss at Adia left the employment agency group SFr15, or 8.7 per cent
lower at SFr157 while Schindler, the engineer, finished SFr100 higher at
SFr5,750 on its growth prospects for 1993.
ISTANBUL lost 4.6 per cent as investors reacted nervously to news of Iranian
and Turkish military movements near the Azeri border. The composite index
fell 568.2 to 11,655.2, a week's decline of 3 per cent. Turnover slipped
slightly to TL1,100bn from Thursday's record TL1,400bn.

<TEXT>
Profit-taking in Footsie futures marked the last day of the equity account
in the derivatives sector following heavy buying in the preceding 3 weeks,
writes Joel Kibazo.
A poor start was followed by sporadic buying of the September contract on
the FT-SE 100, which saw it reach the day's high of 3,087 in the first hour.
It managed to hold its ground for the rest of the morning before the
afternoon sell-off that was led by local traders.
However, the contract managed to maintain its premium to cash throughout the
session and having fallen to a low of 3,066, September ended the session at
3,068, down 18 on its previous close, and about 4 points ahead of its fair
value premium to cash of about 7. Volume was thin, reaching 7,275 contracts.
The traded options once again had an active session though total turnover at
30,610 was down on Thursday's 38,684 lots. Some 7,218 contracts were dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,985 in the Euro FT-SE 100. Amstrad was the
most active stock option at 2,961 lots.

FT  04 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gen Accident firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that the Halifax building society is setting up its own life assurance
business after cutting its ties with Standard Life, and has also negotiated
a service agreement with General Accident, helped the latter's shares
stabilise and recoup some of the substantial ground they lost earlier in the
week. The shares settled 12 higher at 669p after turnover of 1.1m.
Along with other composite insurance shares, GenAcc have been among the
market's best performers since the middle of the year. Since the end of May,
GenAcc shares have risen from 557p to a peak 699p, a gain of almost 22 per
cent.
This week, however, saw the emergence of some determined selling pressure in
the composites, as the big institutions shifted funds out of what some
analysts see as an overbought sector. The Halifax link was viewed as some
much needed good news for a sector that has been given a rough ride in the
last few sessions, analysts said.
Marketmakers were not surprised at the emergence of profit-taking in both
classes of Schroders shares after the merchant bank announced an increased
interim dividend and said profits for the first half were higher than in the
same period of 1992.
Schroders shares have spiralled upwards, notably during the past couple of
weeks, as the market anticipated good trading news. Yesterday saw the
non-voters dip 10 to 1295p and the ordinaries 20 to 1303p. 'After the
excellent profits news from the likes of BZW, Kleinwort Benson, Smith New
Court, NatWest Markets and others, it would have been a major shock if
Schroders had adopted a bearish line on their interims,' said a banks
specialist.
Hambros was the pick of the merchant banks, surging 15 to 368p, after 371p.
SG Warburg put on 4 to 812p.
A Smith New Court buy recommendation was responsible for the strength in
Royal Bank of Scotland, which advanced 11 to 288p on heavy turnover of 7.3m.
London Scottish Bank jumped 7 1/2 to 111 1/2 p, after 113 1/2 p, after the
company confirmed it had received an approach which could led to a bid for
the company. Names put forward as potential bidders included Provident
Financial and Cattles Holdings.
Profit-takers moved into the drugs sector following Thursday's strong rises.
Yesterday, Glaxo lost 18 to 618p, Wellcome 6 to 749p and Zeneca 4 to 756p.
They had risen on the back of speculation that US healthcare reforms, due
within the next two months, would not demand mandatory price controls on
prescription drugs.
Sparkling results from Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, saw the
shares put on 6 to 519p.
Turnover in WPP reached 105m as the advertising group converted 51.47m
preference shares into 58m ordinary shares. Company broker SG Warburg was
believed to have placed 47m shares in the market at 93 pence per share. WPP
closed 7 up at 102p.
Comment on the BSkyB satellite television expansion helped Granada Group,
ahead 7 at 440p. Thorn EMI gained 2 to 1004p.
News that Dr Pepper, the giant US soft drinks group, is to put in place a
'poison pill' to discourage a full takeover attempt by Cadbury Schweppes,
hit shares in the UK company. They closed 10 down at 474, although turnover
was below average. Last week, Cadbury raised its holding in Dr Pepper to
25.9 per cent. Dr Pepper has since approved a plan whereby all shareholders
other then Cadbury would be allowed to buy one new share at half price for
every share already owned, should Cadbury raise its holding further.
Asda finally responded to this week's positive sentiment on the stock, which
included a NatWest buy note and visit from Cazenove. The shares finished 2
1/2 up at 67p. J Sainsbury also recovered slightly, up 2 at 501p, although
Tesco was again undermined by renewed price war fears, closing 2 down at
224p.
Good news about current trading is expected at Siebe's annual meeting on
Monday and the shares finished 18 better at 532p. Negative sentiment
following Thursday's figures and rights issue led to heavy trading in
Rolls-Royce. Volume soared to 12m as the shares lost another 4 to 148 1/2 p.
Reports that August car sales figures, due out today, will show a 16 per
cent increase on a year ago boosted several motor stocks. These included Lex
Service, up 9 at 417p, T Cowie which also finished 9 ahead at 262p, and Reg
Vardy which put on 10 to 174p.

FT  04 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC weak on cautious comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAUTIOUS statement on trading conditions by Lord Prior, GEC's chairman, at
the company's annual meeting yesterday, triggered a flurry of selling
pressure in the shares.
Already weakened in the past few sessions by a Kleinwort Benson
recommendation that clients 'take profits', GEC tumbled from 347p to 342p in
fairly heavy trading before stabilising and edging off the bottom to close a
net 5 down at 344p. Turnover in the stock reached 5.1m shares.
Analysts were surprised by the caution expressed by Lord Prior, who told the
meeting that profits in the first half would be lower than for the same
period last year.
'It was essentially a bearish message from the company,' said one
specialist, who added that GEC's annual meetings are generally low key
affairs. 'There are worries about the performance of the telecoms and power
systems businesses, a deterioration in Austria and Switzerland and the fact
that there is no pick up in the company's early-cycle businesses, such as
washing machines. The only positive was news that overall orders are
slightly above those of last year and that interest income is higher,' the
analyst said.

FT  04 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Widespread falls as account closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADING account in the UK equity market came to a decidedly weak close
last night, when the FT-SE Index showed a fall of a further 15.3 points, and
trading for the new account opened without much sign of buying interest.
Weakness in the US dollar depressed blue chip equities towards the close but
British government bonds remained firm against a background of renewed
pressure within the European exchange rate currency network and a cut in key
interest rates in Spain.
The FT-SE Index fell 15.3 to a final reading of 3,057.3, virtually the low
of the session. The three-week trading account in equities, extended to
cover the UK August bank holiday, has seen share prices rise very sharply on
economic optimism, only to lose a significant portion of their gains over
the past four trading sessions.
At last night's close, the Footsie was still 1.6 per cent up over the
trading account but showing a loss of 43.3 points, or about 1.4 per cent,
over the week.
The picture was much the same in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 10.9 off at
3,478.9 yesterday, but 0.61 per cent up over the account.
UK stocks, already discouraged by a relative absence of US buyers, have
become apprehensive ahead of next week's heavy calendar of UK company
results, which, traders fear, could also bring further rights issue calls.
Uncertainty over the trading progress among UK companies has hurt share
prices this week. There was a cautious market response yesterday to the
trading statement from the chairman of GEC, the blue chip electronics group.
Indications that profit-taking has gathered pace were borne out by a jump in
Seaq trading volume to 727.4m shares from 674.3m in the previous session; on
Thursday, when the Footsie fell by 12.5 points, retail, or genuine customer
activity, reached Pounds 1.73bn, one of the highest daily figures recorded
this year.
Equity strategists were taking a cautious view of prospects for next week.
SG Warburg, still holding to its Footsie 2,900 forecast for the year-end,
warned that 'the risks are growing' in a market on strong share earnings
ratings and Strauss Turnbull urged 'a watchful eye on earnings.'
The long end of the gilt-edged market closed around 1/4 higher but the short
dates were little changed by the August MO money supply data.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weakens on payroll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW questions were raised about the direction of the dollar/D-Mark exchange
rate yesterday after the US non-farm payroll figure for August turned out to
be a great deal worse than the market had expected, writes James Blitz.
The market had been anticipating a net rise in the payroll figure by 144,000
in August, but it turned out to be a drop of 39,000 on the month. There were
a few silver linings in the report, with an upward revision to the July
payroll increase from 162,000 to 211,000.
But the overall impact of the data could not fail to push the dollar down,
especially since they are seen as a precursor to the figures for the US
economy that will come out later this month.
Having been at DM1.6518 against the German currency at the start of the day,
the dollar dropped to a low of DM1.6175 and later closed at DM1.6225.
Against the yen, the dollar also weakened, closing at Y105.00 from a
previous Y105.85.
Mr Marc Hendriks, head of international interest rate research at Swiss Bank
Corporation, believes that the dollar is heading downwards.
He believes that pressure on the dollar will come from the fact that
institutional investors' portfolios are heavily overweight in dollars -
perhaps to the tune of 10 per cent.
Late last month, Mr Michael R, Rosenberg, Managing Director of International
Fixed Income Research at Merrill Lynch, gave a presentation in London at
which he claimed that global investors had a net exposure of 66.75 to the
dollar on his index, up from 48.50 in November 1991. A reading of 50.00
would be neutral, and anything above that suggests an overweight position.
In Europe, the focus of attention was again on heavy selling of the Belgian
franc, despite another round of sustained intervention from the central bank
of Belgium. Again, the market perceived flaws in a high interest rate policy
to defend the currency, and this weakened the franc.
The Belgian currency fell from a close of BFr21.49 against the D-Mark on
Thursday night to as low as BFr21.83 yesterday. It later closed at BFr21.77.
The currency slid sharply in the exchange rate mechanism grid. On Thursday
evening, some 4.01 percentage points had separated it from the weakest
currency, the Danish krone. Last night, that differential amounted to only
2.73 percentage points.
The French franc was one of several European currencies which weakened. It
closed at FFr3.525 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.522. Sterling closed
at DM2.4775 from a previous DM2.4750.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Belgian futures recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN interest rate futures rallied sharply in yesterday's late European
trading as the central bank of Belgium looked increasingly as though it was
losing the battle to maintain its currency's link with the D-Mark, writes
James Blitz.
In the morning, the September Belgian franc contract dropped another 10
basis points after crashing on Thursday in the wake of the rise in the
country's official interest rates.
But, later on, all the contracts rallied as the Belgian franc fell below the
BFr21.70 level against the D-Mark and the currency slipped in the exchange
rate mechanism's grid. Dealers appeared to be taking the view that, as the
franc floated more freely against the D-Mark, there would be renewed
incentive for Belgium to cut rates.
The September contract closed up 20 basis points on the day at 88.00, and
the December contract was up 40 basis points at 92.10.
As on Thursday, the sentiment in the Belgian market affected the outlook for
French interest rates, with dealers taking the view that prospective cuts in
Belgian rates would make it easier for the French to do the same.
The December contract therefore rose 7 basis points to close at 93.99,
pricing 3 month month money at around 6 per cent by the end of the year, a
drop of around 140 basis points from the current cash level.
With the D-Mark performing strongly against European currencies and the
dollar, dealers also felt there was a greater chance of official interest
rate cuts in Germany later this month.
One dealer recalled that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-elect,
had said last month that a strong D-Mark would not be good for German
exports. The December Euromark contract was therefore up 4 basis points at
94.06 at the close.
The sterling market was a great deal calmer after a tumultuous week which
has seen the overnight rate at anything from 2 per cent to 8 per cent.
There was a comparatively small shortage of Pounds 700m, most of which was
removed by lunchtime, bringing the overnight rate to 5 per cent. Three month
money was about  1/16 per cent easier with a very narrow spread around 5 7/8
per cent. The December short sterling contract was up 3 basis points at
94.47.

FT  04 SEP 93 / International Company News: Yamaichi Securities to
compensate its clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YAMAICHI Securities, one of Japan's Big Four stockbrokers, is to reimburse
investors who blamed improper sales techniques by the broker for losses on
investments in mortgage-linked funds.
Yamaichi will repay up to Y10bn (Dollars 94.33m) to clients, who claim to
have not received information on the risks concerning the investment
product.
Mr Ryuji Shirai, senior managing director, said there was a 'high
possibility' that sales staff had breached industry regulations, which
require brokers to warn investors of risks involved in investment products.
Nomura Securities last year paid out over Y20bn compensation to investors
who made similar claims over foreign property-backed securities.
Yamaichi sold Y290bn worth of 'Mortgage Jumbo' investment trust funds in
1991, of which Y170bn fell short of their principal value.
Japan's ailing securities industry was hit with further problems yesterday
as the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the securities
watchdog, recommended that the government punish Yamaichi Securities, Kyosei
Securities, and Universal Securities, for manipulating the stock price of
Nihon Unisys in 1990 and 1991.
Meanwhile, the Japan Securities Dealers' Association ordered Cosmo
Securities to pay a Y40m penalty for tobashi deals, or manipulation of
investors' accounts to hide unrealised losses.
Cosmo has been bailed out by Daiwa Bank due to extraordinary losses of
Y69.8bn from the tobashi deals.
The association also fined Daiwa Securities Y25bn for a fraud scandal
involving a former manager of a branch in suburban Tokyo.
The Japanese finance ministry has given the go-ahead to subsidiaries owned
100 per cent by Japan's Big Four brokerages and Bank of Tokyo to start
ordinary banking and trust business next month.
They are: Nomura Trust and Banking, a subsidiary of Nomura Securities; Daiwa
International Trust Bank, a subsidiary of Daiwa Securities; Nikko Trust and
Banking Corp and Yamaichi Trust and Bank Ltd, subsidiaries of Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities respectively; and Tokyo Trust Bank, a
Bank of Tokyo subsidiary.

cement producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIAM Cement (SCC), Thailand's largest cement producer, blames fierce
competition and aggressive depreciation of its new plant for a 41 per cent
fall in first-half net profits.
Group net profit tumbled to Bt1.55bn (Dollars 61.6m) in the six months from
Bt2.62bn in the same period last year.
Sales rose to Bt20.8bn from Bt17.03bn.
Analysts said the profits had been hit by foreign exchange losses, the cost
of increased dealer discounts and promotions and rapid depreciation of new
plant, including an estimated Bt500m charge for the new Khao Wong cement
plant.
SCC said consolidated results were affected by the cost of establishing new
companies in the group such as Siam Guardian Glass and Tilecera.
However, second-quarter consolidated earnings rose 23 per cent to Bt856m
over the first quarter, while unconsolidated earnings rose 55 per cent to
Bt926m over the quarter, suggesting some recovery from a low point earlier
this year.
'I'm becoming less pessimistic than I was six months ago about the
possibility of a major price war,' said Mr George Morgan, country manager
for HG Asia in Thailand, 'and becoming more bullish on SCC as a result.'

JAPAN'S prolonged slump in consumer spending has hit Marui and Tokyu
Department Stores, two leading department stores, which reported sharp falls
in mid-term sales and profits yesterday.
Marui, a retailer popular among younger customers, posted a 29.9 per cent
fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to July to
Y15.4bn (Dollars 145.28m) on a 7.2 per cent fall in sales to Y249.1bn.
After-tax profits declined 29.5 per cent to Y8.4bn.
Tokyu Department Store saw non-consolidated half-year pre-tax profits plunge
44.9 per cent to Y2.1bn on a 10.9 per cent fall in sales to Y170.8bn and a
38.5 per cent fall in after-tax profits to Y1bn.
Department stores have been hit hard by the current economic slump as
Japanese consumers have tightened their belts and have turned to discount
retailers and cheaper specialty stores.
The bad summer weather has also affected sales of clothing and electric
appliances, adding to the profit decline.
Last week, Mitsukoshi warned it would post a pre-tax loss for the current
business year.
For the full year to next January, Marui projects a 14.2 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y30bn on a 3.5 per cent decline in sales to Y520bn.
Tokyu Department Store expects a 40.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y4bn on a 8.1 per cent decline in sales to Y348bn.

FT  04 SEP 93 / International Company News: Attitude the key to colony's
destiny - How Hong Kong's taipans are preparing for 1997
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS still four years to go before Hong Kong leaves the British Empire, but
the colony's influential British-style trading companies - or 'hongs' - have
already carved out their destiny under the future sovereign, China.
Of the four major hongs - Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine Matheson, Swire Pacific
and Wharf/Wheelock Marden - only the Princely house of Jardine has failed to
draw up favourable alliances with the future sovereign power.
For the hongs, which thrive on government land grants and infra-structural
franchises, politics is of key importance and the potential implications of
the China relationships can be seen already.
Wharf's Cable Television franchise gained rapid Chinese approval, while
opposition continues against a new Container Terminal 'franchise", to be
part owned by Jardine - the Hong Kong government had awarded the contract,
claiming that no approval was needed.
The British corporate grip on Hong Kong has been declining for some time.
The so-called 'colonial amateurs', who ran many of the old hongs, could not
survive the more competitive and volatile atmosphere of the 1970s and 1980s;
their businesses were bought up by the newly-rich Chinese property and
shipping magnates.
Mr Li Ka-shing purchased the restructured Hutchison Group in 1979, the year
in which the late Sir YK Pao bought into the Wharf group, which he later
expanded through the acquisition of Wheelock Marden, in 1985.
The changes have accelerated since Deng Xiaoping visited southern China in
1991, sparking off a surge in investment across the border.
This partly reflected the economic domination of the colony by China, and
the need to expand beyond the limited confines of Hong Kong. But it also
reveals an attitude that to continue to play a significant role in Hong
Kong, companies must show commitment to China. The expatriate is at a
definite disadvantage in developing either political or business links.
Last Tuesday, Mr Simon Murray, one of the last of Hong Kong's taipans - the
traditional British managing directors of the trading companies - was
replaced by a Hong Kong Chinese co-director, Canning Fok, symbolising the
end of expatriate influence for another of the colony's major conglomerates.
Mr Murray, was instrumental in Hutchison's expansion outside Asia, but he
admitted he would have had a lesser role to play in the group's investment
push into China.
Hutchison has already started to develop container terminals, power
stations, property projects and a retail network; and it has been the
chairman Li Ka-shing who is at the forefront of negotiations.
Wharf's chairman Peter Woo, has also made great strides in building on the
Beijing contacts of his influential late father-in-law Sir YK Pao. He signed
up agreements for Wharf to transform the city of Wuhan, into a major
containerisation centre for central China, with infra-structural links to
Hong Kong's container port.
In recognition of their efforts, Peter Woo was appointed an adviser on Hong
Kong affairs to China, while Mr Li is a member of the Preliminary Working
Committee, China's new body on Hong Kong affairs.
If anything, this has increased their influence in Hong Kong, where Mr Woo
and the eldest son of Mr Li are also on the 18-member business panel
selected by Governor Christopher Patten.
For the British-owned houses, with their cultural and linguistic
differences, the barriers are great; but they have tackled the potential
problem in a totally different manner.
Sir Adrian Swire - whose family controls 27 per cent of Hong Kong-based
Swire Pacific - has for years been a regular visitor to Beijing, and the
company is regarded in China as being a committed long-term investor in Hong
Kong.
In 1987, it cemented this relationship by selling a 12.5 per cent stake in
its airline Cathay Pacific to the mainland-controlled Citic group.
Subsequently, China Travel Service and China National Aviation Corporation
have both been brought in as 5 per cent shareholders, leaving the airline
with three extremely influential backers.
The symbolic removal of the Union Jack from the tailplane of Cathay's fleet
has already begun, and the China links were further cemented last year, when
Swire jointly purchased a HKDollars 2.85bn (USDollars 36.8m) property site
with Citic Pacific.
The extent of the contrast with the experience of Jardine, controlled by the
Keswick family, was shown last year, when a Chinese official launched a
tirade against its opium trading past. Jardine's difficulties stem from
China's sensitivity to the concepts of sincerity and trust.
During the 1980s, Jardine shared widespread concerns over the possibility of
post-1997 political change in Hong Kong. But it was alone in stridently
voicing those concerns through its move of domicile to Bermuda and its push
for a primary listing in London. In international terms, this could be
deemed prudent; but in China, it could prove unforgivable.
Jardine director Sir Charles Powell has been on diplomatic missions to
Beijing to improve relationships, but as a former political adviser to Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, this has done little to erase the view that Jardine is a
British, rather than Hong Kong, company.
However, Hong Kong has always had a preponderence of cozy business cartels,
which contrast starkly with its laissez-faire reputation; and it appears the
primary requirement for membership of any post-1997 'club' will be Chinese
attitude, if not Chinese race. The realignment of the hongs suggests that
membership will definitely have its privileges.

ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding, one of the largest financial groups in
Portugal, yesterday reported a 52.3 per cent rise in first-half consolidated
income to Dollars 19.5m.
The group said the increase was due to a higher percentage of ownership in
Banco Espirito Santo, higher non-interest income from banking and related
activities, improved insurance results, as well as the effects of a strict
cost control programme.
At the same time, growth of net income was adversely affected by the
strength of the US dollar against European countries.

FT  04 SEP 93 / International Company News: BNP and Rhone-Poulenc line up
long-term investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris and Rhone-Poulenc, the companies that will launch
France's privatisation programme this autumn, are lining up long term
investors to replace the government on their share registers.
The formation of core shareholding groups is being done in conjunction with
the privatisation commission, a body established by the government to value
the companies and which must also approve the participation of principal
shareholders.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals concern, says
he is confident of securing a group of stable investors which will take
between 25 and 34 per cent of the company's shares after the state sells its
43 per cent stake.
This core shareholding, says Mr Fourtou, should include Assurances Generales
de France, the insurance group, and Credit Lyonnais, one of France's largest
banks. Both are state-controlled and already hold stakes in Rhone-Poulenc.
AGF has 7.7 per cent and Credit Lyonnais 8.6 per cent.
Other core investors could include foreign institutions and French
industrial companies. But Mr Fourtou admits that most French industrial
groups might find it difficult to raise the necessary capital to take a
significant stake.
BNP, which will be the first company to be privatised, has given fewer
indications about the size and composition it desires for a core
shareholding. Its task may also be more difficult since the state holds 73
per cent of its shares, a much larger proportion than it holds in
Rhone-Poulenc.
One of its principal shareholders, however, seems certain to be Union des
Assurances de Paris, the state-controlled insurance group which currently
holds a 10 per cent stake in BNP.
Les Echos, the French financial daily, reported yesterday that this stake
will be increased to 15 per cent at the time of privatisation. BNP declined
to comment on the report. But banking analysts in Paris said that such an
increase was possible given that BNP is itself due to increase its stake in
UAP from 10 to 20 per cent by buying the state's 49.9 per cent stake in
Financiere BNP.
Another potential core shareholder in BNP is Dresdner Bank. The French and
German banks have a joint agreement, which has led to an exchange of board
members, and have expressed their intention to exchange shareholdings of
about 10 per cent.
But official sources in Paris said that size of the cross-shareholding had
not been finalised and that Dresdner may wait until after privatisation
before taking a stake in BNP.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): LME copper market crisis
deferred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market survived a crisis this week, but
remained in a critical condition.
Despite an undeniably bearish fundamental situation - underlined yesterday
by the announcement a further 72,50-tonne rise in exchange warehouse stocks
to 524,500 tonnes - the market had been propped up for some months by a
developing supply 'squeeze', centred on the September delivery period.
The crunch was supposed to come this Wednesday, declaration day for
September options.
In event the day passed quietly, but traders suggested that the crisis had
only been deferred, with the bulk of the options being rolled forward to the
October/December period. 'There is still the potential for mayhem in the
market,' commented Mr Wictor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, part of
the Deutsche Bank group. 'These situations tend not to unwind themselves
without doing some damage to some players.'
At the end of July the LME management attempted to avoid that damage by
issuing a warning that it would use its draconian powers to cool the
situation if the supposed manipulators did not loosen their grip on the
market.
In 1991 it responded to a similar squeeze by imposing a Pounds 25 limit on
the daily 'backwardation' (premium for immediate delivery). The latest
squeeze has not yet become so serious as to provoke a repeat of that action,
but it has persisted for an uncomfortably long period. And in the five weeks
since Mr David King, the LME chief executive, issued his warning the
technical tightness appears to have become worse.
By that time that cash price discount to the three months delivery price,
which would be regarded as normal when supplies are adequate, had
disappeared. But since then the cash/three months spread, far from returning
to normal, has moved to a premium of as much as Dollars 42 a tonne - it
ended yesterday at Dollars 39.75.
The three-months price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,954.75 a tonne, up
Dollars 23.25 on the week, after being supported by what dealers described
as 'influential' cash buying.
There was little buying, whether influential or otherwise to support the LME
tin market, which continued to wilt under pressure from Chinese exports. The
three months delivery price closed yesterday at a 20-year low of Dollars
4,642.50 a tonne, down Dollars 95 on the week.
The LME nickel market resumed trading after the bank holiday weekend in a
less bearish mood and by Wednesday's close the three months position had
rallied Dollars 60.50 from Friday's 6-year low. The rise continued in early
trading on Thursday, but then it ran into merchant selling and profit-taking
and by yesterday's close it was at a fresh low of Dollars 4,517.50 a tonne,
down Dollars 27.50 on the week.
Dealers noted that a further hefty increase of 1,176 tonnes in LME stocks to
a record 107,436 tonnes added to the downward pressure.
A big stocks rise also undermined a tentative rally in the aluminium market,
which had recovered modest losses sustained in the first half of the week.
News of a 71,475-tonne stocks rise to a new record of 2,113,175 tonnes was
not unexpected and was initially shrugged off. Dealers explained that the
apparent influx largely reflected the placing on warrant South American
metal that was already in the warehouses. Nevertheless the market's defiance
eventually gave way and the three months price closed at Dollars 1,162.25 a
tonne, Dollars down Dollars 8.25 on the day and Dollars 7.25 on the week.
For the gold market this was a week of contrasts. It began with the London
bullion market price pushing back above the Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce support
level that gave way late last week, reaching Dollars 371.35 an ounce at
Tuesday's close. But the speculative sellers were quickly back in the game
and they scored a notable success when they forced the December futures
position in New York down through Dollars 370 on Thursday. That prompted a
wave of selling that took the London price to Dollars 361.50 at one stage
and left it at Dollars 364.25 at yesterday's close, down Dollars 4.75 on the
week.
Gold's breakdown in New York was closely linked to a bout of technical
selling in the silver market, which pushed the London price to Dollars 4.35
at one time - the two metals are often interlinked in investment fund
computer programmes. Unlike gold, however, silver continued Thursday's late
rally yesterday and ended yesterday at Dollars 4.57 1/2 an ounce, down 12
cents on the week.
At the London Commodity Exchange the robusta coffee market yesterday
suffered the technical sell-off that many dealers had been expecting
following the dramatic rise of recent weeks. The November futures position,
which had risen Dollars 180 in two weeks, ended the day Dollars 36 lower at
Dollars 1,228 a tonne, down Dollars 53 on the week.
The LCE cocoa market had also shed some of its recent gains, but a Pounds 6
rally yesterday left only Pounds 5 down on balance at Pounds 826 a tonne.
The LCE announced yesterday that its board had agreed to the launch of a new
raw sugar contract, to replace the one that was scrapped in April after
failing to make the transition back from screen to floor trading.
Support for listing raw sugar futures has increased following a dispute in
the New York market over a decision to allow the delivery of Brazilian
crystal sugar as raws, much against the wishes of many traders. The new
contract will be designed to trade at a premium over New York raws.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Schroders rises in first half and increases
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHRODERS, the international merchant and investment banking group, said
yesterday that profits for the first half of 1993 were higher than for the
same period last year.
The group which currently does not disclose detailed interim figures, said
net profits for the whole of 1992 were Pounds 67m (Pounds 56.1m).
From next year the group will be required under the EC Bank Accounting
Directive to change the way its accounts are presented, to disclose its
inner reserves and charge loan losses in full in the year in which they are
recognised.
In a brief announcement to the Stock Exchange yesterday, Schroders said it
was increasing its interim dividend to 4p from 3p a year earlier.
Mr George Mallinckrodt, chairman, said that all functional and geographic
areas of the group had performed well. 'It was across the board. 'The first
half has been kind to us because the environment has been a good one.'
The 'star performer' in the first half had been the global investment
management business bolstered by rising markets, he added.
Schroders is believed to have between Pounds 42bn and Pounds 43bn in funds
under management.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pearson advances 34% to Pounds 46m - Strong
performances by investment banking and newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group that owns the
Financial Times, yesterday reported a 34 per cent increase in first-half
pre-tax profits, mainly reflecting the strong performance of its investment
banking and newspaper interests.
Profits increased from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 46.3m in the period to June
30, including a Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 11.6m) surplus on the sale of fixed
assets.
Sales from continuing operations rose 19 per cent to Pounds 824.4m (Pounds
694.8m) with currency movements accounting for Pounds 77m of the gain.
Currency changes added Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits and had an impact on net
interest costs, which rose to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 7.3m) despite net debt
falling to Pounds 170m (Pounds 185m).
Earnings per share rose by 41 per cent to 6.2p (4.4p) and the interim
dividend is maintained at 5.375p.
Mr Guy Lamming, a media analyst at James Capel, said the results were
'better than had been expected' and indicated that the group's recently
announced plans to focus on its media and entertainment businesses were
correct. Pearson's share price, which has risen sharply over the past year,
gained a further 6p to close at 519p.
As part of the new strategy, Pearson plans to spin-off its Royal Doulton
fine china division later this year and sell a majority stake in Camco, the
US oilfield equipment and services division, through a public offering in
New York.
Commenting on the results Lord Blakenham, chairman, said they reflected 'a
substantial improvement in underlying performance'.
They showed the benefits of three years of cost-cutting. 'We have become
more profitable in indifferent trading conditions and are making the most of
the patchy recovery we have seen in some of our markets. The outlook
continues promising.'
Operating profits jumped by 70 per cent to Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 30.3m) with
all the main divisions, except books and fine china, achieving gains.
Investment banking interests, including the 50 per cent stake in Lazard
Brothers in London, benefited from the improved market climate and more than
doubled their profit contribution to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 7m).
Newspapers operating profits rose to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 15.1m) despite
continuing flat advertising volumes. Within that, the FT Group, including
the newspaper, business information services, and Les Echos, the French
business paper, contributed Pounds 18m (Pounds 13.2m) and Westminster Press
Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 1.9m).
In contrast, the books division, which generally makes its profits in the
second half, saw its contribution fall to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.4m). Higher
losses at Addison-Wesley, the US-based educational publisher, offset gains
at Penguin and Longman.
Profits from entertainment increased to Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 1.6m) boosted by
substantially more visitors to the attractions, particularly the Tussauds
group. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, said visitor numbers
were 13 per cent higher at 3.8m in the first half.
Mr Barlow added that a new television division would be set up for the 17.5
per cent interest in BSkyB, the satellite venture, the 14 per cent stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and the recently acquired Thames Television production
company.
He also said Pearson was seeking to expand its television interests in
continental Europe and Asia as regulations constrain its growth in the US
and UK television markets. No deal was imminent, but he said: 'Watch this
space.'
Oil services achieved a sharp improvement but that was masked by other
factors. As a result operating profits were up to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 7.4m)
on turnover of Pounds 182m (Pounds 128m).

CHINA and Eastern Fund, the first closed-end fund to focus on China,
reported a rise in net profits from Dollars 462,834 to Dollars 1.35m (Pounds
890,000) for the year to July.
Net assets rose 8 per cent to Dollars 53.8m, representing Dollars 2.64
(Dollars 2.43)per share.
The fund was launched on the Stock Exchange in 1985 to invest in listed and
unlisted investments which would benefit from the opening up of the Chinese
economy.
The company had a mixed performance from its direct investments, and as a
result of the development of China's own stock markets and the growth in
listed Chinese companies in Hong Kong, it is now focusing on listed
companies.
During the past financial year, its investment valuations were hit by
falling B share prices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, set
against strong performances from Hong Kong-listed China stocks.
Lord Marsh, chairman, said he was confident of an increasing interest in
Chinese investment. 'If you take a long-term view, the likelihood is that
China will become a major player in Asia and it understands the need to
adapt its business practices to an internationally-recognised capitalist
system,' he said.
China and Eastern has also broadened its focus to include other Asian-listed
companies with substantial business in China and has investments in the
Korean, Malaysian and Singaporean stock markets.
The recommended final dividend goes up to 6 cents (2 cents).

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson sells bullion house to
Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank, is buying Sharps Pixley, the bullion
and metals business.
Sharps can trace its origins back to the 1740s and is one of the five
members of the committee which fixes the gold price daily in London.
Lord Rockley, chairman of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant banking group which
owns Sharps, said the bullion house 'has been a good investment over the
years but today a commercial bank is a better place for it to realise its
potential'. He admitted that Sharps had not been a great contributor to
group profits.
The price, which would be related to Sharps' net assets plus a figure for
goodwill, has still to be agreed but it would not result in any charge to
Kleinwort's accounts. Sharps employees would be transferred with the
business.
Deutsche said the acquisition should be seen as a strategic move designed to
expand its precious metals trading activities.
The bank is active in gold and silver markets around the world. It is one of
the three largest traders of South African gold, has a 50 per cent share of
the German gold trading market and is an important company in the the
Australian nugget market. It aims to become a marketmaker in London where at
present it only trades precious metals.
Sharps is also one of the three companies operating the London Silver Fixing
and became a ring dealing member of the London Metal Exchange in 1979.
Through its New York operations it is a member of the New York Commodity
Exchange.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dalgety expands via purchase of two Unigate
subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALGETY, the food and agriculture group, is buying two businesses from
Unigate, the food and distribution group which is still in the process of
reshaping its activities.
Dalgety is paying Pounds 15.7m cash for Oldacre, which has eight animal feed
mills, mainly in southern England. The business has assets of Pounds 10m and
made operating profits of Pounds 2m on sales of Pounds 78.5m in the year to
March 1993.
In addition, Dalgety is paying Pounds 9m for Morton Foods, which supplies
batter and crumb coatings to the food industry. It has net assets of Pounds
4m and last year made an operating profit of Pounds 330,000 on sales of
Pounds 7m.
Mr Richard Clothier, Dalgety chief executive, said yesterday that Oldacre
would lift Dalgety from 17 per cent to 21 per cent of the 10m-tonne UK
animal feed market, bringing it level with Harrison &amp; Crosfield's BOCM
Pauls, the market leader.
Morton, which has a modern crumb plant in Oxfordshire, would bring
high-value capacity to Dalgety's existing range of food coatings, he said.
Mr John Worby, Unigate finance director, said the disposal of the two
companies fitted in with the group's plan to concentrate its business on the
core food and distribution areas.
Morton had been acquired in April along with Clifford Foods, a dairy and
juice company, and was being sold because Unigate had no other ingredient
businesses.
The sale of the two businesses, along with other recent disposals and
acquisitions, would leave Unigate with pro forma gearing in the low to
mid-30s, he said.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Float boost for Pittencrieff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOTATION in the US of a large part of its mobile communications
subsidiary boosted first-half pre-tax profits at Pittencrieff, the natural
resources and communications company, from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 15.2m.
The flotation of Pittencrieff Communications, in which the parent retains 54
per cent, raised Dollars 68m (Pounds 45m) net of expenses. After taking a
loss on the sale of its oil field service businesses, Pittencrieff booked a
net gain on disposals of Pounds 12.9m. Excluding that, pre-tax profits for
the half year to June 30 were ahead 28 per cent at Pounds 2.3m (Pounds
1.8m).
Including disposals, earnings per share advanced from 9.4p to 53.04p.
Excluding such items earnings fell from 7.35p to 5.83p because of an
increase in the number of shares in issue and an anticipated higher tax
charge. The interim dividend is raised from 3p to 3.25p.
The group now has cash deposits net of borrowings of Pounds 30m, compared
with net borrowing at the end of last year of Pounds 5m.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said the company was now in a
transition period and was cash rich.
Mr Michael Munro, chairman, said the group balance sheet had been 'immensely
strengthened' by the flotation.
In May the group succeeded in a hostile bid for Aberdeen Petroleum for
Pounds 9.2m. This boosted its proved oil and gas reserves by 6.5m barrels of
oil equivalent - or about 90 per cent.
Turnover doubled to Pounds 14m, including Pounds 1.3m from discontinued
operations.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Prowting acquires Galliford for Pounds
22.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROWTING, the lossmaking housebuilder, is buying Galliford Homes Group, a
south of England housebuilder and former Sears offshoot, from its management
for Pounds 22.6m.
The consideration is being satisfied by the issue of 14.4m shares and Pounds
5.3m cash. Of the shares, 9.95m have been firmly placed and 2.68m placed
subject to a 1-for-5 open offer at 120p a share.
Mr Terry Roydon, managing director, said the deal would expand Prowting's
equity by 23 per cent but immediately increase its output from 350 to 900
housing units. The company believed the acquisition would enhance earnings
per share. He said: 'We are combining a long land bank company with
relatively low annual sales with a company that has high sales relative to
its land bank. This will make a company with good volume and a reasonable
land bank and not one which is out of proportion as ours is at the moment.
Make the land bank sweat.'
Galliford reported operating losses in the year to January 1993 of Pounds
430,000 (profits Pounds 924,000) before provisions on its land bank of
Pounds 6.39m (Pounds 9.9m). Turnover was Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 52.2m).
In 1992-93 provisions against land holdings pushed Prowting into pre-tax
losses for the second consecutive year. After a Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 22.4m)
provision, pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.87m (Pounds 17.7m) for the year to
February 28, on turnover down by 4 per cent from Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 35m.
Galliford was founded in 1964 and acquired by Sears in 1975. In 1990 Sears
withdrew from housebuilding and the business was then run on the basis of
using up its land bank.
In April this year, management, supported by funds advised by Schroder
Ventures Advisers, Sumit Equity Ventures and North of England Ventures,
bought the business.
Galliford's development sites are all in southern England.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Peter Black steps out with rise to Pounds
9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER BLACK, the shoes and cosmetics company which supplies Marks and
Spencer, is recommending a 26 per cent lift in its dividend on the back of a
40 per cent surge in pre-tax profits for the year to June 5.
Turnover rose to Pounds 114.9m (Pounds 106.2m) and operating margins to 8.4
per cent (7.7 per cent). The pre-tax profit was Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 6.47m).
According to Mr Stephen Lister, finance director, the results reflected a
strong second half as well as the benefits of recent closures and
cost-cutting: 'We've always said the earnings would come through when that
was completed.'
Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said the group was now favourably
positioned, with growth in overall demand for products and in main
customers' share of the market.'
Cosmetics contributed Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 38.2m) to sales and Pounds 4.4m
(Pounds 3.2m) to pre-tax profits; footwear and accessories turned over
Pounds 60.6m (Pounds 55.9m) and made Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 2.5m).
The small, cash generative distribution and leisure businesses contributed
Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 12.1m) to turnover and Pounds 1m (Pounds 800,000) to
profits.
Borrowings fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 5.5m) giving gearing of 2 per cent (15
per cent). Interest costs fell to Pounds 614,000 (Pounds 1.73m).
A final dividend of 2.77p makes a 3.7p (2.94p) total. Earnings rose to
11.18p (7.92p) per share.
COMMENT
Gordon Black thinks his shoes and cosmetics are recession-proof. Certainly,
that is the case when Marks and Spencer, which buys 65 per cent of Black's
turnover, is the customer. M&amp;S has increased its market share in shoes over
the last five years. Black is now trying to make the same headway in
continental Europe during a consumer recession, relying on a wider customer
base than at home. With most of the impact of cost cutting already reflected
in profits, growth this year will be more modest. Pre-tax profits are likely
only to match 1990's peak of Pounds 10.3m. Earnings of under 13p give a
multiple of almost 16 which is a fair rating until bigger Continental
profits are proven.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Banks cash in on their WPP conversion
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS immediately sold most of the ordinary shares in WPP Group they
received yesterday by converting preference shares in the market services
company.
SG Warburg, the stockbroker, bought 46.9m shares at 93p and placed them at
94p with 60 institutions in the UK, US and Europe. WPP's shares closed 7p
higher at 102p.
WPP said later it had obtained a listing for 57.76m new ordinary shares in
the company to satisfy conversion rights. The shares placed yesterday
represent 8 per cent of the group's diluted share capital.
This was the first opportunity for banks who supported WPP's debt-for-equity
swap last year to book a profit on some of their preference shares.
Shares in WPP have more than doubled this year as hopes of recovery have
improved. However, the group last month remained cautious about an upturn in
its markets.

Cray Electronics Holdings, the data communications and software systems
group which has launched a recommended all-share offer for P-E
International, has purchased an 8.02 per cent stake in its target.
The group revealed in its offer document posted to shareholders that it had
acquired 1.76m P-E shares. In addition it has irrevocable undertakings,
involving 5.28m P-E shares, from shareholders to accept the offer which,
together with share purchases, represents 24.11 per cent of the equity.
The offer document also notes that Cray's board 'anticipates an improving
performance from the P-E group in the future, although the acquisition is
not expected to have any material effect on Cray's earnings per share in the
current year.'
Cray is offering one new share for every two P-E shares valuing the group at
74 1/4 p per share.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Molynx returns to black with Pounds 21,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Molynx Holdings returned to profit in the first half of 1993 but the result
continued to be disappointing, according to Mr Eric Walters, chairman.
Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 21,000. Although less than half of the
comparative Pounds 45,000, it compared with a loss of Pounds 531,000 in the
second half of 1992.
Mr Walters said the closed circuit television and security division
performed significantly better than in 1992. However, the recovery had so
far eluded the markets in which the building energy management division
operated.
CCTV sales rose to Pounds 6.18m (Pounds 4.9m) and trading profit to Pounds
698,000 (Pounds 221,000). There was recovery in the UK and strong growth in
Norway, but recession in other European markets dampened the outcome.
At BEMS, turnover increased to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 6.2m) but the loss jumped
to Pounds 438,000 (Pounds 24,000). In the UK sales moved up 23 per cent with
Synchronised Systems having the benefit of the good order book from three
contracts started in 1992.
Mr Walters said 'unacceptably high' operating losses continued in Germany
and the US. Sales in Germany slumped 62 per cent and a return to profit was
not expected until 1994. It was hoped to be in the black in the US by the
year end.
Earnings per share were nil (0.2p). There is no interim dividend, against
1.3p, the total for 1992.

Reuters Holdings, the international news and information group, is intending
to buy a further 9.46 per cent of the shares offered above the 5.84 per cent
it originally sought under its Pounds 350m share buy-back offer.
Anyone tendering up to 5.84 per cent of their holding will have them
accepted in full. Of any excess 9.46 per cent will be accepted.
An error by one investor accepting for 11m shares rather than the intended
1m lay behind a revision in the acceptance figures for the offer.
The group yesterday said that acceptances had been received for shares
representing 36.19 per cent of its equity against the 38.65 per cent
previously announced.
The offer is being made as a way of returning its cash mountain - Pounds
710m at the end of 1992 - to shareholders.

Burford Holdings, the property investor and trader, returned pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.93m for the six months to end-June, a near-40 per cent
improvement over last time's Pounds 1.38m.
Turnover of Pounds 5.1m compared with Pounds 4.6m. Earnings emerged at 1.27p
(0.68p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 0.65p (0.5p).
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the figures did not incorporate any
contribution from the Pounds 68m property portfolio acquired from Provident
Mutual or from the recent Pounds 41.9m rights issue launched to help fund
the purchase. He said the benefits of these transactions would be seen in
the second half.
It was anticipated that by the year end the rent roll should be annualising
at about Pounds 17m.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Beauford puts Dale into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beauford has requested a receiver be appointed at Dale Group, its mining
equipment subsidiary. The remaining companies in the Beauford group are not
affected.
The decision had become inevitable, said Beauford, as 60 per cent of Dale's
sales were with British Coal.
The deteriorating economic climate there and the real threat of accelerated
pit closures had made it necessary to concentrate financial resources in
stable or expanding markets.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Euromoney expands operations in US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Euromoney Publications is extending its training activities through the
acquisition of US interests for Dollars 1.01m (Pounds 680,000) cash.
It is buying 25 per cent of the outstanding stock of MIS Training Institute,
a Massachusetts-based corporation, and 25 per cent of the partnership
interests of MIS Partners. The remaining interest is held by Mr Michael
Sobol, president of MIS.
Euromoney will lift its stake in MIS to 50 per cent in three stages based on
profits for the three years ending 1996. The remaining 50 per cent is
subject to a put and call option at a value based on profits for the next
three years.
The directors estimate that, based on the expected results of MIS, total
future consideration will be some Dollars 4m. In 1992 it made a pre-tax
profit of Dollars 195,000 and had net assets of Dollars 619,000.

FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Isotron rise puts 20p on share price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED sales in all markets helped Isotron, the Swindon-based
sterilisation company, report a 14 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for
the year to June. The shares rose 20p to 270p.
On turnover ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 7.31m (Pounds 6.51m), profits were
up from Pounds 2.74m to Pounds 3.11m. Earnings per share were 17.3p (14.8p)
and a final dividend of 2.83p is proposed for an increased total of 4.34p
(3.94p).
The cash balance increased over the year to Pounds 4.5m despite paying for
substantial cobalt purchases in the second half and the capital cost of a
new gas sterilisation plant in the Irish Republic.
On prospects Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said that interest income would be
lower because of capital spending in Ireland. However, the year had started
well and with the UK economy showing signs of improvement he said operating
profits should continue to progress.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Few prizes from the politicians: Robert Peston questions
former ministers' value to business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party this week made its ritualised complaints when Mr Norman
Lamont, former chancellor of the exchequer, joined merchant bank NM
Rothschild, following the well-trodden path taken by former ministers to the
private sector.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, wants former ministers banned from
private sector jobs for at least two years after leaving office. The
implication is that companies derive an unfair benefit from the expertise
and contacts of former ministers.
However, hard evidence that former ministers boost profits of the companies
they join is patchy, prompting one headhunter to remark, only half in jest:
'If Labour remained committed to the overthrow of capitalism, it should be
encouraging companies to employ ex-politicians.'
Another headhunter, Mr Nicholas Cobbold, of Knight Wendling, concurs: 'I can
hardly remember a politician making a success of business. . . I can't tell
you how many of them ring me up for help (in getting jobs).'
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, who controls the bank Mr Lamont is joining, says
the benefits the former chancellor brings include his knowledge of interest
rate movements.
But those comments did not assuage the fears of one Rothschild executive
worried about Mr Lamont's record in office.
Nonetheless, so many ex-ministers have been taken on by companies and City
firms, that some must be of value to their new employers. Many of those who
succeed seem to do so in large part despite - rather than because of - their
ministerial experience.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive Smith New Court, the securities house,
says that Lord Walker, who served in the 1980's as secretary of state for
energy and later for Wales, has been a tremendous help to his firm as a
non-executive director.
But he says it is Lord Walker's business expertise, not his government
experience, which has been most valuable. 'He started Slater Walker (and
left that banking group before it collapsed in 1974),' says Mr Marks.
'He knows how to make a profit.'
Lord Walker showed his commercial acumen when he had a last minute change of
heart in mid 1991 about becoming chairman of Maxwell Communications
Corporation, only month's before MCC's founder Mr Robert Maxwell died and
his business empire collaps-ed.
Lord Young, who as chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications
group, has more executive responsibilities than most other
politicians-turned-businessmen, says the four years he spent as employment
secretary and then as trade and industry secretary taught him nothing about
how to run a company. He regards his period in office as a brief interlude
in his long-running business career - he used to be a property developer.
Mr Dick Taverne, one of a handful of former Labour ministers to have picked
up directorships (for the past 18 years he has been a director of industrial
group BOC and of insurer Equity &amp; Law) says ministerial experience is not in
the least bit relevant to taking an executive post: 'Ministers do not run
their departments,' he says. 'Their permanent secretaries do that.'
Politicians who cross over into commerce fall into two broad groups: those
like Lord Tebbit, Sir Norman Fowler (who resigned this week as a director of
security company Group 4) and Lord Walker who have each accumulated a hatful
of non-executive directorships and a small group, including Sir John Nott
and Lords Young, Younger and Prior who take on greater responsibilities as
chairmen of big companies.
The main role of any non-executive director is to monitor the performance of
executives on behalf of shareholders. Mr Taverne says: 'Politicians can be
good monitors, but the best monitors are more likely to be former merchant
bankers, or management consultants.'
On the other hand, non-executives can sometimes be poor overseers, no matter
what their background. The non-executive directors of Barclays, who include
Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor, and also some of the UK's most powerful
businessmen, such as Sir Denys Henderson, the ICI chairman, have been widely
criticised for the clumsy way in which they managed the process of finding a
replacement for Barclays' former chairman, Sir John Quinton, over the past
year.
Ministerial experience may, however, be appropriate training for chairmen.
Lord Younger, former defence secretary and now chairman of Royal Bank of
Scotland, has 'a remarkable ability to defuse difficult situations',
according to Dr George Mathewson, RBS's chief executive.
What the Labour Party gets exercised about is the notion that former
ministers exploit their political friendships to win valuable state
business. There is evidence that companies with international interests can
benefit from a former minister's contacts.
Lord Prior has been helpful to GEC, where he is chairman, in opening doors
outside the UK.
'In certain parts of the world he is very useful,' says a GEC adviser.
'When I go to Egypt and Pakistan, they (the officials and ministers) know me
from my time in government,' Lord Young says. 'It is helpful if you are
dealing with issues such as getting an overseas licence.'
He says that Mr Francis Maude, former financial secretary, is the best
example of a politician profiting from his ability to deal directly with
senior foreign politicians. Mr Maude is paid an estimated Pounds 500,000 a
year to head up the team at US investment bank Morgan Stanley working on
international privatisations.
Lord Young is adamant, however, that there is nothing sinister about using
business contacts in that way. 'It is quite legitimate', he says.
Closer to the UK, Smith New Court has won Welsh clients as a result of the
connections Lord Walker made as Welsh Secretary.
The Labour party is most outraged when former ministers join the boards of
companies they may have regulated or privatised as ministers (examples
include Lord Walker at British Gas, Lord Tebbit at British Telecom, and Lord
Young at Cable &amp; Wireless).
But a company's relationship with UK officials and ministers can be strained
by having a former minister as a director. Lord Young says: 'Civil servants
get very nervous when an ex-minister comes in.' He says they are so keen not
to show favour to a former minister that they may discriminate against him
and his com-pany.
Lazard Brothers, the UK merchant bank, was acutely aware of this danger when
Sir John Nott, the former defence minister, was its chairman, and he rarely
tried to exploit his contacts.
Similarly Salomon Brothers insisted that Lord Young, who is a director of
the US investment bank, should stay as far away as possible from its attempt
to secure a role in the government's sales of BT shares in the spring. The
sad truth for shareholders in companies which employ ex ministers is that
Labour's conspiracy theories are not watertight.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Earth Mother Exec seeks New Man: Feminism and
thirtysomethings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've come a long way, baby, boasted the Virginia Slims cigarette
advertisements in the 1970s, as author Shirley Conran, aka Superwoman,
revealed that life was too short to stuff a mushroom.
But the myth that today's woman can have it all after 100 years of feminism
and 20 of the equal opportunities industry was exploded this week.
A national survey of 11,000 men and women of all backgrounds born in 1958
suggests feminism has failed Britain's female thirtysomethings. The survey,
funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, found most women were
caring for the children, many as lone parents; moreover, they were doing the
bulk of the housework and earning less than men.
Women's average full-time hourly pay, at Pounds 4.40, was 85 per cent of
their male counterparts'; women working part-time earned just Pounds 3 an
hour on average; and affordable childcare facilities and company creches
were 'virtually non-existent'.
Do these findings strike a chord with professional women in their 30s?
Rosa Monckton, managing director of Tiffany, the jeweller, has an
eight-month-old daughter, mortgage and busy husband. She is typical of women
who have found the combination of work and motherhood more demanding than
anticipated.
'We want too much and expect too much,' she says, even though she has been
able to juggle her hours to see more of her daughter, Savannah. 'You can
combine motherhood with a job, but it's bloody. I feel particularly sorry
for single mothers who have to work.' She has rearranged her day so that she
leaves the office at 4.30pm to be home in time to give the baby supper.
Nina Harris, 36, set up her own estate agency, which she runs from her home
in Notting Hill, London, two and a half years ago. This has made her recent
return to work after her son's birth less traumatic.
'I've tailored my life down now, taking over from the nanny at 4pm on the
dot. If I had to do menial tasks I'd be sent over the edge. But I am
responsible for laundry and shopping,' she says, echoing the ESRC survey's
finding that only one in five men shared household chores.
For a woman working in more male-dominated environments, the careful
management of time to combine career and motherhood is more difficult.
Jill Shankleman works for the consultancy Environmental Resources
Management's Oxford office, and supports two teenagers. She believes that,
in order to cope with the pressures on them, women have had to 'grow up',
whereas 'men haven't'. Women, she says, 'work it all out, develop
compromises and present solutions'.
In common with women working in the City, she detests the 'unnecessarily
macho' 1980s attitude to work which means getting in very early and staying
very late as proof of commitment.
'We should follow the Germans who regard it a sign of inefficiency to stay
late,' she suggests.
For married gilder and artist Clare Mosley, today is the fourth day that she
has been back at home in Camberwell with her toddler, Augustus, her first
child, since packing up her studio in Battersea.
'I'm climbing the walls but he's loving it,' she says. 'It's mind-numbing
but I thought I would try to do one thing at a time.'
Different generations of women have, she believes, have different attitudes.
'My mother was brought up to have a husband; her expectations were very low.
Ours are so high. We have to have the husband, the job, the children and the
right colour kitchen.'
She worries that, having temporarily stopped working, she will be confined
to the social ghetto sometimes inhabited by mothers who do not work. 'Men
lean across you at dinner parties to talk to each other,' she remarks.
Praise for feminism is more likely from professional women without children.
Brigid Larmour, 33, artistic director of Contact Theatre in Manchester,
believes 'every politically conscious feminist is making things easier for
the next generation'.
Even so, she believes that having it all - high-powered job, children, home
and professionally satisfied husband - is not possible. 'The state is no
help whatsoever, employers expect unreasonable hours, and the extended
family's not there.'
It seems, ultimately, that Executive Earth Mother cannot exist without
domesticated New Man, and he has failed to materialise.
But men pay a price too. 'They have no flexibility at all,' says Alison
Coburn of Common Purpose, an educational charity.
Feminism may not have solved the problems of today's female
thirtysomethings. But it has not liberated men from their bondage either.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Credit management best solution to
debt problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELAINE JENKING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While the Forum of Private Business cannot be faulted on its efforts to
obtain a statutory right to charge interest on overdue debts ('MPs back
right to levy interest on late debts', August 19), I wonder whether its
energy is correctly directed? We already have a right to charge interest on
overdue debts and any experienced credit manager will be able to obtain this
without the need for parliamentary intervention (Interest on Debt Bill).
May I suggest that if the FPB has sums available to pursue this matter, they
be directed towards the training of suitable candidates to become effective
managers of credit.
Credit management is a relatively new profession which has emerged over the
past few years. A good credit manager can make all the difference between
the success or failure of a business. Whether we have a statutory right to
charge interest on the late payment of debts or not, the problem will still
be the collection of this money - all businesses will end up with is a
bigger financial problem unless they have the right people to collect their
debts in the first place.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No quick fix, but a benefit to UK
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GEOFFREY BROAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent letters have highlighted the polarised opinions on the success,
or otherwise, of working practices in Japanese subsidiaries in the UK (July
19, and August 28/29). Both positions may, in fact, be accurate.
There is now general agreement that Japanese, like other foreign
multinationals, select strategies and methods to manage successfully the
interface between local human resources and production technology set in the
context of a changing international business environment. There are,
however, variations in the responses of local managers, workers and trade
unions to the application and adaptation of Japanese-style management. Why
then do 'traditional' low trust and adversarial attitudes appear evident in
some plants and not apparently in others?
We know that Japanese manufacturers undergo phases of organisational
development which may, in part, account for the variable performance and
employee attitudes. None of them can therefore expect to be completely
immune from some industrial relations problems associated with the
introduction of high employee participation systems which increasingly link
remuneration with close appraisal and team working. Such 'prototypes' have
important implications, not only for shop floor relations, but also in terms
of the propensity of local managers and supervisors to work with their
Japanese colleagues in participative modes.
'Japanisation' can never be simply a quick fix to the problems of British
industry. However, we need to explore further the dynamics of change in
these plants and more Japanese firms should assist by opening up research
access to allow detailed empirical investigations to take place.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Corruption now high on the ethical
agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LAURENCE COCKCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'How economics is linked to ethics'
(September 2), strangely omitted to deal with corruption in this context.
Strange, because this year has seen at least four major or significant
governments (Japan, Italy, Brazil and Kenya) shaken to their foundations or
overturned on the issue of corruption at the interface of business and
government. Elsewhere, corruption at this interface gnaws ever more deeply
into the social fabric, an effect which is at least partly an (unintended)
by-product of large-scale privatisation.
The issue is now clearly a major one on the global agenda. Its effects are
particularly disastrous where they lead to the chronic misallocation of
resources in the developing world, and so directly foster impoverishment.
The ethical questions are also complex: at first sight the securing of an
award for a major power plant in a country of the south may sustain several
hundred jobs in the UK for a period of months. That is unquestionably good
news. It is less good if the contract has been awarded because a bribe has
been paid and a more cost-efficient, environmentally friendly power plant
should have been installed. The UK or EC taxpayer may have helped sustain
employment through schemes such as the Trade and Aid facility, but have
contributed to a negative effect in the south.
There are many involved in the exporting world who are concerned about this
dilemma. In the US an exporting company can pay fines of up to Dollars 2m
and a responsible director or company official can go to jail for up to five
years for transgressing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Yet most EC countries and the UK allow bribes paid in pursuit of overseas
business as a tax deductible expense if appropriately 'buried' in the
accounts.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Crime and punishment: Are the Tories losing the initiative
on law and order?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across Britain, a new spirit of vigilantism is taking root as people despair
of the rising tide of crime.
Recent examples include:
The Norfolk village that united to protest at five-year gaol sentences for
two men convicted of kidnapping a 16-year-old wrongly suspected of being
behind a local crime wave.
The gang of vigilantes in Newtown, Powys, calling themselves the 'twelve
just men', who administered rough justice on local hooligans by inserting a
ferret into their trousers.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons Group, the UK's largest electrical
retailing chain, who said in June that shopkeepers were forced to adopt
vigilante tactics to stem the rising tide of property crime.
This week, a Gallup opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph found that
three-quarters of those questioned thought that vigilante actions such as
these could sometimes be justified.
The reason? Nearly half those questioned had little or no confidence in the
police. Only 9 per cent saw justice being done in trial sentencing and 77
per cent thought sentences were too light.
This will make worrying reading for Mr Michael Howard, home secretary since
May, as he approaches this year's Conservative party conference. The
conference has often been an uncomfortable occasion for Tory home
secretaries. The assembled representatives regard a tough line on law and
order as one of the party's core values. Many would like to see a return of
hanging, some of flogging.
They will want to be reassured that he can reverse the rising tide of crime,
which has doubled the number of annual recorded offences in England and
Wales from 2.5m in 1979 to 5.6m in 1992.
He will not find it easy. Crimes affecting the everyday life of ordinary
people have reached record proportions. Domestic burglaries totalled 708,200
in 1992, thefts of vehicles 587,900 and thefts from vehicles 954,200. There
were 902,500 offences of criminal damage, including vandalism, which
provides an all-to-visible reminder of rising crime.
The growth has been enormous. Domestic burglary has almost trebled since
1979, thefts from vehicles are up 243 per cent and criminal damage has risen
180 per cent. Growth rates in most crimes have accelerated since 1989.
Some of the rise reflects greater reporting by victims, who increasingly
have insurance cover and need a police report to make a claim. But the
British Crime Survey - which is based on asking people about their
experience of crime - suggests the recorded figures seriously underestimate
the crime rate.
Actual crime levels for the offences that can be surveyed by this means may
be three times the recorded crime figures. The 1992 survey found that twice
as many domestic burglaries were committed as recorded, three times as many
thefts from vehicles and seven times as many offences of vandalism.
Most crimes go unreported, says the survey, because the victims either
regard the offences as trivial or feel that the police would be unable to
take any effective action.
On the latter point, the popular wisdom may be right. Though crime rates
have risen, clear-up rates have declined. In 1979, over 42 per cent of
notifiable offences were cleared up: by 1992, the figure had fallen to 26
per cent.
More than three-quarters of serious offences, such as violence against
people and sexual offences, are cleared up. But fewer than one in five
domestic burglaries, vehicle crimes and criminal damage offences are solved.
Adding to the government's discomfort over these figures is the fact that
some of the biggest rises have been recorded in the Tory heartlands.
Gloucestershire, for example, has seen home burglaries rise by 552 per cent
since 1979 while car crime is up 489 per cent. Leicestershire, Avon and
Somerset, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk are all at the top of the
league tables for growth in crime.
This rising tide of crime has been skilfully exploited by Mr Tony Blair, the
shadow Home Secretary and one of the most adroit strategists on Labour's
front bench. He recognised that previous attempts to capitalise on the
government's crime record had failed because Labour was seen as 'soft' on
criminals. He has therefore placed himself at the forefront of attacks
against the government for failing to be tough on crime, wrong-footing
Conservatives who see this as their constituency.
Mr Blair has linked this with an older Labour refrain on the importance of
tackling the underlying causes of crime, including youth unemployment,
absence of training opportunities, poor housing and falling standards of
living among the lowest-income households.
This perspective has received unexpected backing from Home Office research
published in 1990 that provided evidence of a link between the state of the
economy and crime levels. The study showed that levels of crimes against
property grow faster when the economy is in recession and more slowly when
the economy is growing.
If Mr Howard hopes to reduce the crime level without waiting for the
recovery, he will have to find ways of improving the clear-up rate.
'A 1 per cent increase in the clear-up rate would, on average, reduce the
number of burglaries by 1.6 per cent,' according to Dr David Pyle, an
economist at Leicester University.
Certainty of punishment is more important in deterring crime than its
severity, says Dr Pyle. However, increasing the severity of punishment by
imposing more and longer prison sentences appears to be cheaper than
increases in police manpower.
The government has already chosen the more cost-effective route. Prison
numbers are again rising following the decision to revoke elements of the
1991 Criminal Justice Act designed to reduce Britain's high prison
population. This week's announcements on increasing private sector
involvement in Britain's prisons should allow the Prison Service to increase
capacity without a leap in its budget. By contrast, police numbers are
unlikely to rise. The priority will be implementing Sir Patrick Sheehy's
report as part of the package of reforms to the police service. Additional
funds for police resources are unlikely with a public sector borrowing
requirement of Pounds 50bn.
For Mr Howard, therefore, the options are relatively limited as he works on
his speech for the October conference. He cannot offer the delegates more
police officers, though he may encourage further use of unpaid special
constables. He can also try to legitimise vigilantism volunteer schemes,
such as the 'parish wardens' pioneered this week in three Herefordshire
villages.
But the home secretary will promise more custodial sentences for convicted
criminals and fewer cautions. He will also say that sentences will be
longer, as courts regain the right to consider previous convictions when
sentencing. And he will curdle the constituency representatives' blood with
pledges to make prison regimes less comfortable.
Whether this will satisfy the 'twelve just men' and their avenging ferret
remains to be seen. But it is all Mr Howard can offer in present
circumstances.

The Mousetrap
</HEADLINE>

   From Mr PETER COTES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It gives me no pleasure to contradict such an authority as Lord
Goodman, but this I am compelled to do in view of your Observer story,
'Sound advice' (August 19).
The facts rather than the 'fancies' of what has become a highly charged
matter are detailed in my recent autobiography 'Thinking aloud'. I was not,
as Lord Goodman suggests in his memoirs, 'impoverished' when Peter Saunders
asked me to direct The Mousetrap. I had three successful productions in
being at the time. It was not on Arnold Goodman's advice that I took a
royalty on the production as payment; I had already been offered 1 per cent
and his role was limited to drafting a letter for my agent to send to
Saunders suggesting 1.5 per cent.
While not as humorous as my old friend's book of anecdotes (how could it
be?), my own work is without doubt more accurate in dealing with 'Goodie's'
amusing encounters with theatricals.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Men in the News: The Middle East's odd couple - Arafat and
Rabin / Hands of friendship across the desert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cairo, January 1994. A small, pudgy Arab in well-pressed khaki fatigues
strides up the steps of the palace, salutes the presidential guard and
stands before an unsmiling Israeli with white, dishevelled hair. Hesitantly,
the two elderly men shake hands and look each other in the eye. Peace is
declared in a conflict that has shaken the Middle East since well before the
Jewish state was founded in 1948.
A summit meeting between Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, and Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of Israel - lifetime enemies
who still cordially detest one another - is, of course, still a fantasy.
But it is a measure of the current momentous events that it no longer seems
unthinkable. A week ago, hardly anyone would have expected to see the
Israeli government negotiating with the PLO, or hear both sides hailing
unprecedented draft peace accords allowing for mutual recognition and for
Palestinian self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
Now it seems only a matter of days before agreements of this kind emerge -
possibly triggering a sharp acceleration of the Middle East peace process,
and the signing of similar accords between Israel and all its Arab
neighbours. Provided that nothing bloody or unforeseen occurs in this most
unpredictable of regions, it may not be too long before the world watches a
sight that few expected to see: Yassir Arafat staging a triumphal ride
through the sleepy Jordan valley town of Jericho.
That such events have moved from fiction to possible fact is, in significant
part, due to Rabin and Arafat.
Although the draft accords - due to be voted on by the PLO's central council
in Tunis and the Israeli Knesset in Jerusalem next week - were negotiated
for Israel by foreign minister and Labour party rival Shimon Peres, it is
Rabin's political imprimatur, and the trust in which he is held as a
guarantor of Israeli security, that has won them popular support in Israel.
On the Palestinian side, the accords are almost exclusively of Arafat's
making: a desperate last throw by a weakened leader to secure a part of
Palestine before all is lost. Whether he can make the agreements stick, or
how they will work in practice, must remain open questions. But there is no
doubt that he has staked his political life - and maybe his physical life as
well - on making them do so.
What makes this week's events vibrate with significance is the fact that the
principal personalities have featured on opposite sides of the Middle East's
most traumatic political divide for so long.
The life story of Rabin, a gravel-voiced, chain-smoking 71-year-old, reads
almost like a history of the state of Israel: a commander with the Palmach
guerrillas during the 1948 war of independence (in which Arafat claims to
have fought onm the Arab side), he has served as prime minister twice; first
time round in 1974 he was the first native-born Israeli to occupy the job.
He was chief of army staff during the 1967 Six Day War, Israel's most
stunning military success, and ambassador to Washington during the early
1970s as Israel fought the Arabs again and forged its strategic partnership
with the US.
Now, having conquered the West Bank, Gaza and Golan Heights 26 years ago, he
may find himself able to hand parts of them back.
To many Israelis, Rabin personifies the mixture of toughness and
plain-dealing they like to see in themselves. It has long been the
soldier-turned-politician's view that peace with the Arabs is necessary, but
that it should never be granted at the expense of Israel's security. As
defence minister in the 1980s he was behind the bombing of PLO headquarters
in Tunis, the assassination of Arafat's number two, Khalil-al Wazir, and the
policy of 'might, force and beatings' adopted to suppress the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories.
And it was as strong man prepared to negotiate from strength that he was
elected last year to a second term as premier after a bruising leadership
battle with Peres. Since then he has shown no let-up, deporting 400 Islamic
fundamentalists, sealing off the territories after a wave of stabbings and
launching a devastating bombardment against Lebanese civilians in
retaliation for guerrilla attacks against Israel.
Yet such actions have consistently been combined with calls for a negotiated
peace with Arabs.
Ever since his troops stormed through the West Bank in 1967, he has known
that Israel could not rule over their Palestinian inhabitants for ever and
remain a predominantly Jewish democracy. He has frequently pointed to the
dangers of weapons proliferation and increasing Islamic extremism in the
Arab world as arguments for Israel to exploit every opportunity to make a
deal - on its own terms.
That such an opportunity has now presented itself is largely thanks to the
PLO's Arafat, a man whose stubbly face and chequered keffiyeh have been
synonymous with the Palestinian struggle for more than 25 years. It was he
who decided, after 22 months of fruitless on-off negotiations between Israel
and a Palestinian delegation in Washington, to propose that Israel withdraw
its forces first from Gaza, a squalid sliver of land on the Mediterranean
where Arafat's parents were born, and from an area round Jericho in the West
Bank. Palestinians there would be granted self-rule - initially under PLO
authority - as part of a phased, interim programme for autonomy in the
occupied territories. Their final status would be settled later.
From Israel's point of view the deal is a dream: it leaves Jewish
settlements in the territories intact, preserves full Israeli control over
its security and borders, does not broach the thorny subject of Jerusalem
(claimed by Israel as its 'eternal, indivisible capital'), and does not
concede a Palestinian state. Instead it allows the two sides five years to
discover whether they can cohabit in something resembling harmony before
further steps have to be taken.
For the Palestinians, the fruits are more bittersweet. They have refused
countless better offers. stretching right back to the 1920s. On every
occasion they could advance good arguments for holding out for more. The
danger, as they discovered through hard experience, was that - like Bosnia's
Moslems - they would get nothing.
The hyperactive, obsessive Arafat has long been conscious of the need to
compromise. He confides to friends that he is haunted by the spectre of
failed Palestinian leaders in the past - men, as he puts it, who 'were
always right and ended up with nothing'. Since 1974, he has urged his
fractious cohorts to adopt more flexible approaches to their struggle for
statehood, culminating in 1988 in the PLO's decision to recognise Israel and
accept the partition that the Palestinians refused in the 1940s. Now he
appears to be going further, accepting arangements for autonomy he had
previously likened scornfully to South Africa's Bantustans.
Several factors have conspired to galvanise the PLO leader into his
desperate last throw. First, he is all too conscious of the weakness of his
organisation in faraway Tunis: bereft of money and powerful friends after
his disastrous alignment with Saddam Hussein in the Gulf war, and riven by
internal dissension. Second, he was deeply worried by the advance of Islamic
militancy - represented by the fundamentalist group Hamas - in the occupied
territories, Third, he may well have been rattled by the apparent emergence
of an alternative Palestinian leadership there in the person of his
long-time comrade Feisal al-Husseini. If there is one thing that Arafat has
single-mindedly striven to preserve in his 24 years as PLO chairman, it is
his own position in the limelight as representative of the Palestinian
cause.
Thus it is that the guerrilla leader of old is preparing to return and take
direct responsibility for the Palestinians under occupation, and that Israel
and the PLO find themselves - like F W de Klerk and Nelson Mandela in South
Africa - in the bizarre position of contemplating joining forces against the
extremists.
Even assuming he can force the mutual recognition and autonomy deals through
his organisation's inner councils in the next few days, he faces a challenge
keeping violent opponents within the territories in check. In Gaza at least,
where militants are particularly strong, something not far short of a
Palestinian civil war may be in prospect.
Arafat's hope must be that his return as figurehead of Palestinian
nationalism - coupled with the deployment of large amounts of international
aid money - will give such a strong boost to Palestinian morale that the
Islamic or other radicals will melt away. The alternative - that his deal
with the Israelis has come too late, and that the territories are now beyond
redemption through economic development or autocratic rule - is too awful to
contemplate.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Media mogul with the mostest: Rupert Murdoch's reach is
global, prompting criticism that he has too much power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The older he gets, the faster he seems to move and the more radical and
global his business vision becomes. At 62, Rupert Murdoch is, depending on
who you believe, entering the sinister endgame of a plot to dominate the
media world with his evil empire, leaping over outdated regulatory barriers
and offering unrivalled choice to consumers everywhere, or finally
succumbing to the archetypal media mogul's disease - megalomania.
Even by Murdoch's standards, this has been an extraordinary week. Apart from
the theatricals of the launch of Sky Television's new subscription package,
which by next year will include 20 channels, he pulled the following rabbits
out of his hat: a 24-hour cable channel in the US; a second Sky Sports
channel in the UK; a link with BT to investigate the 'super' communication
highways of the future; and tie-ups with two other significant media players
 -Mr Emilio Azcarra Milmo, of the Televisa empire in Mexico, and Mr Leo
Kirch in Germany, who owns extensive rights to show Hollywood films there.
In addition, there was a venture with National Transcommunications of the
UK, and Comstream of the US, to produce a digital satellite system which
could lead the way to hundreds of television channels in both Europe and
Asia; the Dollars 12m purchase of Delphi, a Boston-based company, looking at
electronic newspapers, a deal seen by Murdoch as an investment in research
and development; and, in the real newspaper world, the decision to cut the
price of his flagship UK daily, The Times, from 45p to 30p.
Just as the flurry of activity seemed to be dying down and Murdoch left
London to head home to Los Angeles for his daughter's wedding next week,
another big development was under way in Hong Kong yesterday.
The chairman of News Corporation was negotiating the sale of a majority
stake in the Hong Kong daily he controls, The South China Morning Post.
Murdoch was clearly increasingly nervous about the difficulties of running a
daily newspaper once Hong Kong reverted to China's control in 1997 and was
happy to take his profits. The long-planned sale was delayed by negotiations
to get into the Hong Kong television market - talks that led to the Dollars
525m purchase in July of a majority stake in Star TV, the Hong Kong-based
satellite television company that broadcasts five channels to 38 Asian
countries.
For Murdoch, Star TV is obviously the 'big one'. He can scarcely restrain
his enthusiasm about the potential of the Asian market, although he is also
keenly aware of the risks he has taken on.
'It's a global dream that you never quite dared have, and suddenly its
there,' he said in an interview before announcing the 'new age' of satellite
TV in the UK.
'India is a huge market. I see Star being split into at least two companies
 -one for India and one for China. They are totally different cultures.' He
added that eventually he foresaw a separate Star service for the 200m people
of Indonesia. In countries such as China the hope would be to run several
joint channels with local broadcasters.
The global gleam in Murdoch's eye is that soon he will own channels that
circle the globe.
'We will now take Sky Sports around the world. We will take Sky News around
the world. There will be a parallel international service and Sky News as we
know it today will be for Britain and Europe,' he said, adding that he
planned to work with local partners for the international service in
different parts of the world.
Such a sweeping vision makes it inevitable that Murdoch will challenge both
the BBC World Service Television - although the BBC's 10-year contract to be
carried on the Star system will be honoured - and, more particularly, Mr Ted
Turner's Cable News Network.
'I don't want to say any more about that (Sky News) because it looks as if
I've got a war with Ted Turner which is what it means. He has said all along
'I know where my competition is coming from; it's Rupert',' Murdoch said.
The risks in Asia are great. Problems range from the difficulty of producing
satellite dishes cheap enough for Asia's mass market, to allegations of
cultural imperialism, and the difficulty of persuading the Chinese
authorities to allow direct satellite broadcasts rather than waiting for
cable networks to be built. Cable would give the authorities more control
over what is viewed. If, for any political reason, Star was no longer
welcome in Hong Kong, Murdoch believes it could be broadcast from Los
Angeles - 'certainly Australia'.
Because of these uncertainties, News Corporation has financed the Star deal
through equity rather than debt. Murdoch has become more wary of taking on
debt since News Corporation came within hours of collapsing three years ago.
The company's borrowings had ballooned to more than Dollars 7bn following a
series of acquisitions, including TV Guide in the US.
The origins of this long march into Asia and his growing ambitions lie in
London, and the creation of a satellite system broadcasting to more than 3m
homes in just over four years.
'There is no question we have shown here (the UK) that first in gets the
market,' Murdoch said. Sky Television was first into the UK satellite
market, followed limply by British Satellite Broadcasting. By the time the
two merged into BSkyB in November 1990, Sky was in the driving seat.
(Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in BSkyB
and News Corporation owns half.)
The satellite company is now trying to learn another important lesson: how
to create what is virtually a subscription-only service and persuade people
to pay for at least one channel, Sky One, that until now has been 'free'.
Rather surprisingly, the plan to sugar the pill with an array of new
channels, most from the US - covering everything from country music, family
entertainment, women's features, to children's programmes, a shopping and a
documentaries channel - seems on track.
The growing financial muscle that should flow from BSkyB's subscription
revenues, combined with News Corporation's ownership of five national
newspapers in the UK, from The Times to the News of the World, is leading to
more intensive calls for government action to combat Murdoch's media
hegemony.
Under the headline 'Sky Trek: The Next Degeneration', Labour's shadow
national heritage secretary, Ms Ann Clwyd, issued a statement this week,
arguing that the 'unregulated growth of Mr Murdoch's empire is an affront to
a democratic society'. She called for an urgent Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation. Yesterday, Labour formally called on the Office of
Fair Trading, the consumer watchdog, to intervene.
Part of News Corporation's growing power lies in the technology it has
developed for subscription television. Almost all the channels in the Sky
Multi-Channel package are 'scrambled' so that only those who pay can view.
The channels are 'unlocked' by a 'smart card' like a telephone card. The
system is called VideoCrypt. Murdoch plans to take VideoCrypt to Germany in
a joint venture with the German broadcaster Pro-7, which is associated with
the Kirch organisation.
'It looks as if we will get VideoCrypt as the standard,' Murdoch said,
adding he intended to expand into Germany, where there are already 5m
dishes, and carry several Sky channels in English.
'We hope it will become a bigger partnership with Kirch - pay-per-view
(paying for individual programmes or events) and a movie channel. We will
co-operate with anyone who can clear German rights for their programmes,'
Murdoch said.
The German alliance is coming at a time when Murdoch's proposed partnership
wiith Canal Plus, Europe's leading pay television group, is crumbling. 'That
partnership has fallen apart. We are trying to put it together again but the
French are very difficult,' he said.
Murdoch is just as interested in the studios of Televisa in Mexico City,
which specialises in the production of popular romantic soap operas. Under a
joint venture with Fox Broadcasting, Murdoch's US network, more than 500
hours a year will be produced of soaps and events. The first event will be a
search for the best young opera singer in the world.
The multilingual soaps will break new ground in production economies. There
will be a chief executive, a single script and single set, but two
directors. The Spanish-speaking director will work the first eight-hour
shift with Spanish-speaking actors. In the next eight-hour shift, the same
episode will be produced, using American actors.
'This will get out costs down and provide prime-time broadcasting for our
new channel in America,' said Murdoch, who hopes to sell them around the
world.
'We can now go to Procter &amp; Gamble and say: 'Do you want to sponsor this
soap opera around the whole world'?' Murdoch said.
He has got to such a commanding position for two principal reasons. He has
assiduously monitored new technology - always a few paces behind the
visionaries but a step or two ahead of most corporate giants. He has been
prepared to follow hunches in creating markets rather than waiting for
others.
But Murdoch is still restless, looking to see where technology is going
next. This characteristic is highlighted by the joint venture with BT and
the purchase of Delphi. With BT, the trick will be to combine, on an
experimental basis, satellite, cellular and ordinary telephones to provide
information and entertainment direct to 500 homes.
With Delphi, the prospect will be of an interactive electronic newspaper
where subscribers can call up stories, say from The Times on small portable
screens.
But that will not be the end of the story. On Wednesday night, at a
Whitehall banquet to mark the launch of the new Sky package, Murdoch
interviewed by satellite Arthur C. Clarke, the man who first set out the
concept of satellite television more than 50 years ago.
In the conversation, Clarke referred to a device, perhaps like a watch, that
would give instant voice and visual contact with anywhere in the world or
call up information from anywhere in the world.
Murdoch, who claimed this week that technology was undermining the
traditional power of the media mogul, was all ears.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD ECONOMIC recovery looks like being painfully slow. Ironically, the
upturn is being hampered by a legacy that derives in equal measure from
opposite sides of old ideological divides. The high tide of interventionism
and welfarism may have ebbed, but the public deficits remain to inhibit
fiscal policy, regardless of the political stripe of incumbent governments.
At the same time, an accumulation of private debt prompted by financial
liberalisation has severely limited the usefulness of monetary policy in
putting the economic show back on the road. The result is that economic
recovery looks like being an unduly protracted affair. Is there anything
that governments can do to reassert control over the business cycle?
Undoubtedly there is; but if the industrialised countries are to accelerate
the growth process, they will have to learn some new tricks. For another
striking feature of the world economy at present is that many of the
traditional escape routes from recession are blocked.
The weakness of the US external account means that the world's largest
economy will not embark on another experiment in global Keynesianism of the
kind initiated by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The Germans, who
traditionally rely on an upturn in exports to pull themselves out of
recovery, suffer from an unaccustomed lack of competitiveness, which will
prevent them enjoying an adequate external boost. Domestic demand is
constrained by the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy, while the federal
government is being forced to confront the fiscal laxity that followed
German unification.
Joyless time
Japan has some room for fiscal manoeuvre and modest scope for further
monetary loosening. But there are doubts about how far a new and wobbly
coalition government will be willing or able to go. With the world's big
three economies thus constrained, the other participants at the party are
condemned to a fairly joyless time - especially if they impose on themselves
excessive real rates of interest, as the French persist in doing. The few
bright spots are to be found mainly among the devaluationists like Britain,
Italy and Spain; and even their pleasure will be severely diminished if the
French response to the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism involves
throwing an eleventh-hour spanner into the works of the Uruguay round of
trade talks.
Against that background, governments have rightly perceived that the way to
re-establish control over domestic demand is to combine fiscal retrenchment
with reforms to the supply side of the economy. Yet this is easier said than
done. The verdict on President Bill Clinton's budgetary package must await
the full details of his healthcare reforms; but his much-trumpeted,
narrowly-won deal with Congress was notably soft in tackling the structural
element of the deficit. Similarly in the UK the jury will have to wait until
November, when an untried chancellor will unveil the first budget combining
revenue and expenditure proposals.
Productivity advantage
The more interesting experiments are being carried out in the two miracle
economies of the post-war world, Germany and Japan, where a consensual
approach to economic management has been combined with heavy-handed
regulation that has favoured producers over consumers. This week Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, the German economics minister, shocked people with a government
discussion paper which suggested that Germans, were overpaid, over-regulated
and over-subsidised.
In effect he was acknowledging that in a world without capital controls the
comparative productivity advantage of Germany and other developed countries
is being rapidly eroded and that a structural loss of employment to the
developing world calls for some hard thinking about federal, state and local
government benefits and subsidies that now exceed 50 per cent of gross
domestic product.
For its part, the new seven-party coalition in Japan has announced a list of
60 deregulatory measures designed to loosen up the notoriously inefficient
distribution system and reduce the prices of many goods to the consumer.
In economies that traditionally move by consensus, these are big changes.
Paradoxically Japan, which is usually regarded as the most rigid of the
Group of Seven countries in matters economic, may be better placed than
Germany to change gear. Even if the present coalition collapses, a
generational change is firmly under way in the Liberal Democratic party.
Taken together with the attempt to reform corrupt money politics, it could
imply that the country is close to one of those turning points in its
history when the formation of a new consensus leads to very rapid political
and economic change.
The impact of rapid economic growth in Asia will be painful for the older
industries of the developed world. But in the long run trade remains a
positive sum game in which all will ultimately benefit from the dynamism of
these new entrants to the market system.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Court plea on Thorp tests fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENPEACE, the environmental group, yesterday failed in its second attempt
to stop uranium testing at British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant
in Cumbria.
The Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 majority decision, rejected the plea for an
order stopping the tests before the High Court examines their legality on
September 14.
Greenpeace is arguing that the tests, which will contaminate part of the
Pounds 2.8bn plant with radioactivity, prejudice the government's decision
on whether to give the plant a licence to start operation. The government
has already said it is 'minded' to grant a licence, but will decide finally
after the public consultation ends on October 4.
Yesterday's ruling on the testing still leaves Greenpeace free to challenge
the eventual decision on the licence.
Lord Justice Glidewell and Lord Justice Scott agreed there was nothing in
the fresh evidence before the court to invalidate the ruling of Mr Justice
Brooke on Wednesday that BNF should be allowed to begin the tests before
September 14.
Lord Justice Evans said the new evidence showed that although the first
phase of testing had started on Thursday, contaminating uranium would not be
introduced 'into the machinery' until the second phase began in about a
week.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Brown attacks tax relief for share options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should abolish tax relief on executive share options, Mr
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday, launching a fresh
Labour assault on boardroom perks and remuneration.
Speaking just three days after Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor,
rejoined NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the merchant bank, as a non-executive
director, Mr Brown also called for a 'decent interval' to elapse before
former cabinet ministers were allowed to accept private-sector
directorships.
Mr Brown said ministers had not spoken out against boardroom 'excesses'
because so many former members of cabinet were themselves among the
beneficiaries.
'This new and cosy City cabinet - many privatising industries or awarding
privatisation contracts from the cabinet room one day and then involved in
running them from the boardroom a little later - cannot command confidence
or credibility,' he said.
Former ministers singled out by Mr Brown for 'walking straight from the
cabinet room into the boardroom' included: Lord Tebbit, the former trade and
industry secretary; Lord Walker, the former energy secretary; Lord Lawson,
the former chancellor; and Sir Norman Fowler, the former transport
secretary.
Earlier this week it was announced that Sir Norman, now Tory party chairman,
was to resign as non-executive director of Group 4 Securitas, the
international group of security businesses, from next month.
Group 4 - and Sir Norman's involvement with the company - hit the headlines
in April when four men escaped or were wrongly released within days of Group
4 starting work as the first private-sector company to run services
escorting prisoners between prisons and courts.
The company, which won the contract to run the Wolds remand prison on
Humberside, is likely to be among the bidders for new business arising from
the government's decision to contract out the management of a further 10
prisons to the private sector.
Referring to a Labour survey of directors' pay increases, Mr Brown said
boardroom remuneration in leading companies had gone up by 90 per cent more
than average wages in the last five years.
Speaking in Wolverhampton, he highlighted share options held by senior
executives in the electricity industry which he said could yield a 'Pounds
45m handout'.
Tax relief on executive share options was likely to cost the exchequer about
Pounds 250m over the next five years, he predicted.
Mr Brown added: 'But, more than legislation, it will require the pressure of
public opinion that values fairness and dislikes unfairness that will
eventually tame these boardroom excesses.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Rise in M0 dashes hope of rate cut: Cheaper credit unlikely
by Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINGERING HOPES for an early cut in interest rates were suppressed yesterday
by the news that the amount of money in circulation increased again in
August.
Bank of England figures showed that M0, mainly notes and coins in
circulation, grew a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent last month, to give a
year-on-year growth rate of 5.2 per cent.
This was the highest annual growth rate since July 1990 and compares with
4.8 per cent in July and 4.4 per cent in June.
The figure will be taken as a further sign of economic recovery because M0
has acted as a fairly reliable guide to levels of activity in the retail
sector since the end of the recession last year. Mr George Magnus, economist
at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'These figures suggest that the recovery is
going to continue at a reasonable pace.'
The rate of narrow money growth is now 1.2 percentage points above the
ceiling of the government's zero to 4 per cent monitor range for M0. Its
buoyancy indicates a steady recovery in retail spending.
However, economists said that the particularly sharp rise in the
year-on-year growth rate was partly due to a large increase in the annual
rate of bankers' operational deposits which make up a small proportion of
M0. These deposits are more influenced by conditions in the money markets
than by economic activity.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'The large
annual rise in M0 is due mainly to bankers' balances. The underlying trend
remains pretty flat.'
If bankers' balances are stripped out of the figures, notes and coins grew
by 4.8 per cent in the year to August, compared with 5.2 per cent in the
year to July.
Nonetheless, the resilience of M0 will reduce pressure on the government to
ease monetary policy in the near future.
There is some expectation for another base rate cut at the beginning of
October when the three political parties hold their annual conferences, but
many analysts do not expect to see lower rates at least until the Budget at
the end of November.
The Bank also announced no revision to broad M4 money. M4, M0 plus bank and
building society deposits, grew by 0.9 per cent on a seasonally-adjusted
basis in July to give an annual rise of 3.6 per cent.
The Treasury has set a 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range for broad
M4 money growth. This has remained weak throughout this year.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Channel train prepares for test run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROSTAR, Britain's first Channel tunnel express train, has been rolled
out for engineering tests before making its debut run, Tim Burt writes.
Once checks have been completed operating tests will start amid some secrecy
in late-night runs between Aston and Lichfield in the Midlands.
The first train, of which 10 carriages are ready, is being prepared in
Birmingham by Metro-Cammell, a subsidiary of Anglo-French engineering group
GEC Alsthom.
Workers at the plant are assembling 14 further trains for the Channel tunnel
fleet, ordered by British Rail, SNCF of France and SNCB of Belgium at a cost
of Pounds 24m each.
After the tunnel's opening next summer 38 Eurostar trains will link European
cities at speeds of up to 180mph. Services to London, however, will operate
at lower speeds until the delayed Channel rail link is completed.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Curbs on invalidity benefit closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday appeared closer to a decision to tighten doctors'
guidelines on whether patients should receive invalidity benefit.
Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, said the first of a series of
government-commissioned surveys on the subject confirmed anecdotal evidence
that doctors were 'finding it difficult to adhere to the criteria'. The
survey said doctors were including some people that they should not, he
added.
Invalidity benefit is one of the areas earmarked for possible savings in the
government's long-term review of social security spending.
Ministers have argued for scrutiny of the area partly because invalidity
payments are one of the fastest-growing benefits at a time when the nation's
overall health has been improving.
In the past 10 years the number of people receiving the benefit has risen
from 700,000 to 1.5m. Expenditure has more than doubled in real terms over
the same period to Pounds 6bn a year and is likely to reach Pounds 8bn by
1995-96.
All five commissioned studies of the benefit are expected to be completed in
the next two months, paving the way for a final decision about the time of
the November Budget.
The government may also decide in November to impose tax on the benefit. Mr
Burt said yesterday: 'There is no secret it has always been intended to tax
invalidity benefit. It is a matter for the chancellor at what stage he
brings it into tax.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, accused the government of
a ploy to 'soften the public up for an autumn hatchet job on benefits to the
most vulnerable'.
The benefit - which is more than unemployment benefit - is typically paid to
men in their 50s who have lost their jobs and are seen by social security
officials as unfit for work.

FT  04 SEP 93 / PM tries to keep a sunny disposition: John Major returns
from holiday on Tuesday. Kevin Brown reports on the pitfalls awaiting him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNUG IN his borrowed Portuguese holiday villa, Mr John Major has had two
uncluttered weeks to reflect on the outlook for the coming year. It will not
have been a relaxing experience.
In the prime minister's absence Downing Street aides are claiming that the
end of the Maastricht tussle will allow a line to be drawn under the
divisions and disasters of last year.
Add in an accelerating economic recovery, say the siren voices, and a
reunited Conservative party would soon be back on course for a fifth
successive election victory.
Mr Major, who returns to Downing Street on Tuesday, will be hoping that the
optimists are right. But he will be painfully aware of the long list of
banana skins lying in wait for a misplaced government foot.
Ironically, after a year in which most of the prime minister's energy has
been directed to overcoming parliamentary rebellions, the Commons may be the
least of the government's problems.
At this early stage of the parliamentary year the only immediate legislative
problem appears to be the British Rail privatisation bill, which the Lords
did their noble best to wreck in the dying days of the last session.
It has become clear during the summer recess that a large number of
Conservative MPs, mainly in the south-east commuter belt, are sympathetic to
the Lords amendment, suggesting that reversing it in the Commons may be
difficult.
Even more worrying for Mr Major, the potential rebels are drawn largely from
loyalists who have refused to join previous rebellions against the
government.
At least Mr Major can console himself with the hope that the loyalists can
be won back if a sufficiently ingenious compromise can be found.
But the hard-core rebels - a shifting coalition of a dozen or so
Euro-sceptics and embittered Thatcherites - remain on the alert for any
opportunity to embarrass the government.
Their best chance may come in December when the European Council meets in
Brussels to plan the future of the European Community in the wake of the
Maastricht treaty and the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Major will be walking a tightrope. He must appear sufficiently
communautaire to avoid backtracking on his vision of Britain 'at the heart
of Europe' while sounding sufficiently sceptical to avoid a renewed eruption
from the back benches.
He must also be dreading the publication of Baroness Thatcher's memoirs, due
next month. Inevitably attention will focus on his part in her downfall.
From Mr Major's point of view the timing could hardly be worse. The party is
already riven by an acrimonious debate on the possibility of tax increases
in the November Budget as part of the government's drive to bring its Pounds
50bn budget deficit under control.
Rightwingers such as Mr John Townend, chairman of the party's finance
committee, have forecast an irretrievable split if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, decides that higher taxes are essential.
Usually changes in tax rates are a matter for the chancellor after
discussion with the prime minister and agreement on public spending totals
in the cabinet's EDX committee, which starts work in earnest next week.
This year it will be at least as much a matter for Mr Richard Ryder, the
chief whip, who will have to estimate how much indigestion the right can be
made to stomach.
In spite of the problems Mr Major is not entirely a prisoner of events. For
example, the Queen's speech is likely to concentrate on issues designed to
rally the party, such as removing regulatory burdens from industry.
The prime minister is also giving discreet support to candidates on the
centre-left of the party for the chairmanships of the party's influential
backbench committees. The right over-reached itself in winning the majority
of chairmanships last year, but a failure by the centre-left to dislodge
most of the sitting rightwingers would look like a government setback.
Mr Major has other personnel problems too: what to do about Mr John Patten,
the education secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
Mr Patten's return after illness has stifled immediate talk of a reshuffle,
but it is still not clear whether Mr Heseltine has fully recovered from a
heart attack in June.
Mr Heseltine is expected to return to the fray at the party conference next
month. But if he is less than fully fit Mr Major may be forced to move him,
perhaps to replace Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman.
However he chooses to approach the choppy waters ahead, Mr Major knows that
his main problem is to demonstrate that he has a firm hand on the tiller.
That is not yet beyond him, but the thought may have spoilt his holiday.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Ofgas clarifies stance on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFGAS, THE gas industry regulator, has no intention of dictating to British
Gas how to deploy its profits, Sir James McKinnon, the director-general,
said yesterday.
But he stressed that the company would not be allowed to raise prices for UK
domestic consumers to make good losses incurred in overseas expansion.
'That's a non-starter,' he said.
Sir James issued a statement after a report in yesterday's FT that Ofgas was
keen to 'ring fence' British Gas's Pounds 1.2bn domestic profits to protect
them from costs associated with high-risk overseas projects.
Mr Greg McGregor, the director of competition and tariffs, indicated that
draft proposals were being presented to the company. The proposals would be
part of the restructuring which British Gas is expected to undergo following
last month's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report recommending a
break-up of the company.
Sir James said Ofgas's stance would not prevent the company deploying
domestic profits to finance foreign activities if it wanted to.
British Gas said the MMC report had found no evidence that it had
underinvested in the UK or that the gas supply business had been adversely
affected by the growth of its overseas interests.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Hunt may address TUC next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, is likely to break with political
tradition and address the Trades Union Congress - but not until next year,
according to senior TUC officials.
Mr Hunt, who has gone out of his way to make conciliatory gestures to the
unions, informally sounded out the TUC about addressing this year's
congress, which starts on Monday.
Officials said that his advance was politely rejected but they also made
clear that an invitation for next year was probable.
Mr John Monks, who takes over as the new general-secretary of the TUC next
week, is very keen to distance the union movement from the Labour party and
turn the TUC into a more apolitical organisation.
Mr Monks himself would probably have favoured a signal-setting invitation to
the minister this year but several senior trade union leaders would have
been less keen.
One TUC official said: 'It is a bit premature this year, especially given
that the minister has just steered through an employment law abolishing
wages councils.'
But many union leaders are impressed by Mr Hunt's record of working with
unions in his three years as Welsh secretary and believe he is sincere about
wanting regular contact.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday withdrew plans to publish
school-by-school league tables of truancy rates in primary schools.
He provoked opposition from teachers' unions by confirming, however, that
truancy league tables for secondary schools will be published in November.
Data at primary school level will be made available for each local education
authority.
The secondary-school tables will show the percentage of pupils missing one
or more sessions - a morning or an afternoon - without authorisation, while
tables comparing local education authorities will include figures on the
percentage of pupils absent at least once without permission, and the total
number of sessions missed. All state and independent schools that accept day
pupils must submit the information to the Department for Education.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'What the government now needs to do is to apply the logic
of this decision in the primary sector to secondary schools and thereby
complete the U-turn it has half performed.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Subtle franchise bid displaced LBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON RADIO News, which will replace LBC as operator of two of London's
commercial radio stations next year, was the dark horse of the latest radio
franchising round.
Although LBC's franchise was known to be at risk, most believed the stiffest
challenge would come from a consortium which included Reuters, the news and
information group, Independent Television News and Associated Newspapers,
publishers of the Evening Standard and Daily Mail.
London Radio News, which draws on the expertise of former senior LBC
employees, felt that a low-key approach would be more effective. Bidders pay
the same nominal amount for licences, so were judged solely on the quality
and range of their proposed programmes, plus financial support.
Although admitting that they had been working on this bid 'for some time',
the successful team concentrated resources on quietly preparing as strong a
submission as possible to the Radio Authority. It did not publicise its coup
in landing Mr John Tusa, former managing director of the BBC World Service,
as chairman.
A consortium of pension funds and insurance companies, organised by Guinness
Mahon, the merchant bank, will invest Pounds 4m in London Radio News. The
biggest investor in the private company is Hachette, the French media group,
with a 20 per cent stake.
Mr Peter Thornton, former managing director of LBC, is editor-in-chief of
LRN. He wants to position the two stations so they compete effectively with
the BBC, whether or not the corporation starts its all-day news service.
Mr Thornton said the FM station would be the public's first choice for
instant news with a 20-minute segment being constantly updated. There will
also be sport and City and financial news at the same intervals. He said
this concept worked well in big cities such as New York. The AM service,
London Forum Radio, would offer phone-ins and discussion programmes.
London Radio News will employ about 160 people, compared with LBC's present
staff of about 120. Mr Thornton said: 'We will not rely so much on
personalities, although we will still have some big names.'
The new company might take space in the City Road offices of The
Independent, but there will be no financial or journalistic links between
the two organisations.
Mr Bruce Fireman, a director of Guinness Mahon, is deputy chairman of London
Radio News and sits on the board of The Independent.
Mr Fireman said London Radio News would next year bid for the third national
independent radio franchise, which is to be speech-dominated, but said the
company would be viable if the bid did not succeed.
Advertising in London is forecast to grow at 7 per cent a year - higher than
the national average. London Radio News believes it can reach about 20 per
cent of its potential audience of 10m people and take a similar share of
advertising. It is projecting annual revenue of about Pounds 10m.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Unions strongest in Merseyside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEYSIDE is the only region where trade unionists make up the largest part
of the employed workforce, figures compiled by the GMB general union from
the government's latest labour force survey show.
Three years ago four other regions had workforces with more than 50 per cent
trade unionists: Tyne and Wear, the rest of the north-east, South Yorkshire,
and central Clydeside.
But since 1989 the proportion of the workforce in unions in Tyne and Wear
has fallen from 54 per cent to 47.4 per cent and in South Yorkshire from 50
per cent to 49.1 per cent. In inner London less than a third of the
workforce are in unions (32.2 per cent), about the same figure as four years
ago.

THE FINAL report by the Local Government Commission on its proposals for
reorganising Derbyshire County Council has been postponed for seven weeks,
the Department of the Environment said yesterday.
Its provisional recommendation to create two unitary authorities, one for
Derby and the other covering the remainder of the county, was strongly
criticised by local MPs and employers when it was announced in May. The
commission's final decision, following formal responses from the local
community, will not now be published until November 7. It was scheduled to
be released on September 19, just before the Conservative party conference.
Decisions on reorganisation for Durham and Cleveland have been brought
forward by two weeks, and will now also be announced on November 7.

FT  04 SEP 93 / OFT urged to probe Times cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading is considering a request from the Labour party to
investigate Mr Rupert Murdoch's decision to cut the weekday price of The
Times from 45p to 30p, a move which The Independent fears will drive it out
of business, write Ian Hargreaves and David Owen.
The OFT said yesterday that Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair
trading, was 'monitoring developments and would give serious consideration
to any representation on the matter'.
Later it said it had received a submission from Mr Robin Cook, Labour's
trade and industry spokesman.
Mr Cook's letter - also signed by Ms Ann Clwyd, Labour's national heritage
spokeswoman - asked the OFT to instigate a monopoly reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on 'whether the dominant position of News
Corporation and its subsidiary companies . . . is resulting in unfair
competition.'
Noting that The Times was 'already loss-making', the letter expressed
concern that the price cut 'could well lead to other competitors without
external financial subsidies being forced out of the market'.
It said: 'An investigation is required to establish whether this constitutes
an anti-competitive practice under the Competition Act.'

FT  04 SEP 93 / Thousands 'at risk' from drug-resistant TB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS OF THOUSANDS of people in Britain could be at risk from drug-resistant
strains of tuberculosis, a leading TB specialist warned the British
Association meeting at Keele University.
Dr Tim Peto of Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine
said some patients in the US could not be treated effectively with any known
antibiotic. The UK has TB strains that are resistant to the best 'frontline'
drugs but they do succumb to 'secondline' antibiotics.
'The impact of multi-drug resistant strains of TB in Britain would be
immense,' Dr Peto said. 'The total cost of managing a major TB outbreak
would be huge.'
Infectious patients with resistant strains might need to be isolated for
long periods.
'Intensive health care would be needed to ensure that patients complied with
complicated drug regimens for many months in order to check the infection,'
Dr Peto said.
'In recent years we have seen the impact of HIV disease on public awareness
of the impact of sexual behaviour. It is difficult to predict what the
effect on society would be if a serious infectious disease emerged which is
spread simply by coughing, sneezing or talking.'
He blamed 'the inequality of health care in the US' for the emergence of
multi-resistant TB there. Those at risk in the UK - likely to be tens of
thousands - would be those who did not have regular access to NHS
facilities. The homeless were especially vulnerable.
A number of once-vanquished microbes that are now making a comeback, the
conference heard. Professor Michael Levin of St Mary's Hospital Medical
School, London said: 'In the past 20 years we have witnessed a dramatic and
frightening re-emergence of infectious diseases as major forces against
which mankind must struggle for survival.'
He said many old diseases had returned and a host of new infectious
diseases, which were not dreamed of 15 years ago, had appeared.

FT  04 SEP 93 / New car sales soar above highest estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR SALES in August have exceeded the most optimistic motor industry
forecasts and are expected to reach around 440,000, the third highest-ever
August sales total.
The figures, which will be released today, are expected to show an increase
of close to 18 per cent from the 373,804 achieved in August last year, when
the industry was still struggling to emerge from three years of recession.
The industry had previously forecast an increase of around 11 per cent.
August is the most hectic period of the year for the retail motor industry
with sales stimulated by the change of the registration letter.
The month is a key test of the state of demand and has accounted for 23 per
cent of annual new car sales in each of the last two years.
New car sales were showing an increase of around 12 per cent after the first
20 days of August, but the industry has been surprised by a late surge in
registrations - in particular by Ford and the PSA Peugeot-Citroen group.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the industry had handled
'unprecedented sales over the last few days of the month'.
The highest level of new car sales in one month was achieved in August 1989
at 500,112.
For the full year Vauxhall yesterday forecast a rise in new car
registrations of around 9 per cent to 1.73m-1.74m from the 1.59m achieved
last year, which would still leave the industry well below the peak sales
year of 1989 at 2.3m.
The UK is presently the only car market in west Europe which is showing any
growth.
Sales across Europe fell by close to 18 per cent in the first seven months
of the year, and this steep decline is forcing some UK manufacturers to cut
production as export orders fall.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said that a high level of
visits to dealer showrooms had been sustained throughout the month of
August. 'Maybe customers are using their savings to buy cars now, because
interest rates have come down so far on their savings.'
He said that sales to company fleets had been particularly strong which
suggested that companies were beginning to lift earlier constraints on car
replacements. August was a record month for fleet sales.
Land Rover announced yesterday that it is to introduce a night shift at its
Solihull assembly plant in order to increase output of its successful
Discovery four-wheel drive vehicle.
It has recruited an additional 300 workers during the summer raising its
workforce to 8,400 in order to increase production from 700 to 900 a week.

ahead with the next reviews in the programme, Cumbria and Lancashire, and

FT  04 SEP 93 / Theory put on Aids mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW THEORY to explain one of the great mysteries of Aids was presented to
the British Association meeting in Keele yesterday.
Professor Robert May, a well-known mathematical biologist from Oxford
University, sought to explain why there is such a long and variable interval
 -often as long as 10 years - between first infection with HIV (the virus
that causes the disease) and the onset of life-threatening symptoms.
He based his theory on a combination of computer modelling and clinical
observations.
It suggests that HIV eventually overwhelms the immune system by its
extraordinary mutation rate, which is greater than that of any other known
virus. Over a period of years dozens of different HIV strains evolve in the
patient, and the immune cells cannot cope with such diversity.
'Each new strain requires a largely-specialised immune response. On the
other hand, any strain of HIV can kill or impair the function of any of the
immune cells,' Prof May said. 'Mathematical studies of this peculiar system
show that there can be a 'diversity threshold' beyond which the immune
system can no longer control the virus.'
The theory suggests that chance plays an important role in the time taken to
develop Aids, depending on the rate at which random mutations arise in the
stages soon after infection.
Prof May says the theory, which he developed with Dr Martin Nowak, 'puts the
virus itself centre stage'. In contrast, many others focus on different
factors for triggering the collapse of the immune system. Although much
available evidence supports the theory, more experiments will be needed to
confirm it.
If Prof May is right, sufferers should in theory take anti-HIV drugs as soon
as possible after infection to suppress replication of the virus and the
emergence of new mutants. But he says the drugs currently available, such as
AZT, have too many toxic side effects for him to give such advice with
confidence.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Smith faces tough fight on union votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRENGTH of opposition to plans by the Labour party leadership to end
trade union participation in the selection of parliamentary candidates was
underlined yesterday.
The agenda for next month's party conference includes nine pages of motions
and amendments on the reform of its constitution, most of which are hostile
to the proposals.
The depth of hostility will disappoint Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who
won an important victory in July when the party's national executive
committee approved a deal hammered out in talks with the unions.
Mr Smith is unlikely to be surprised, however. Several big unions, including
the TGWU general union, have made clear that they oppose the deal, which
focuses on one-member-one-vote elections.
Most of the critical motions have been submitted by leftwing constituency
parties although their members would benefit most from a reduction in trade
union participation.
Many constituency parties complain that any weakening of Labour's links with
the unions would risk transforming the party into 'another Liberal
Democratic party' or worse, a mark two Social Democrat party.
Several unions and constituency parties have submitted motions giving full
or partial support to the leadership. These include the Fire Brigades Union
and the AEEU engineering and electrical union.
The most substantial opposition comes from unions such as the GMB general
union and Nupe, the public services union. Both have submitted motions
seeking to undermine the leadership's proposals.
Such an electoral system would be restricted to union members who paid the
political levy which helps to finance the Labour party, but would break the
link between constituency party members and MPs which the leadership wants
to strengthen.
Mr Smith's first public opportunity to win over union critics will come when
he addresses the Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
He is expected to avoid any direct reference to the issue, however, to avoid
charges of attempting to hijack the conference agenda.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Standard Life's battle to maintain sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD LIFE must have seen the writing on the wall. Late last year it
unveiled a new logo designed to promote brand-name identity and has recently
ventured into image advertising on television.
It will need more than a stronger image to prosper in future, for like
increasing numbers of leading life insurers, Standard Life is about to find
itself frozen out of the high street.
Standard Life had the presence of mind in 1989 to 'tie' itself to the UK's
largest building society, the Halifax. That outlet provided 18 per cent of
all its new business in the UK last year.
Yesterday the Halifax said that from the end of 1994 it will sever the
arrangement under which it sold Standard Life insurance and pensions
products exclusively, and will only sell those of a new company it plans to
form itself.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Securities, said:
'To Joe Public who doesn't read the newspapers, Halifax Life is a better
brand than Standard Life. It has no public presence although its a cracking
good company.'
Mr Tom King, general manager (marketing) at Standard Life, said the company
would quickly recoup the lost business by selling more through the
independent financial advisers which account for 70 per cent of its sales,
and by expanding its direct salesforce.
But industry analysts are doubtful. Mr Mike Wadsworth, partner in the
insurance practice at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co, said: 'Clearly
in the area of mortgage-related business it is difficult to see how the
shortfall can be made up quickly.'
A number of the nation's largest banks and building societies have abandoned
ties with outside insurance com-panies in favour of self-owned operations.
Only two leading building societies, Nationwide with Guardian Royal
Exchange, and Alliance and Leicester with Scottish Amicable, remain firmly
tied to large insurance companies - and that may not last.
Nationwide said: 'Our tie doesn't come up for renewal until the end of 1994.
We are now looking at all our options.'
Five years ago the Financial Services Act determined that retailers of
financial services must either sell the products of one producer
exclusively, or must sell the best product of a broad range of producers.
Most banks and building societies saw exclusive arrangements as more
profitable. But inevitably, Mr Wadsworth said, frustrations set in. 'Its
hard for a major insurer to give the attention that the retailer thinks his
customer needs,' he explained.
In short, insurance companies do not tailor products for the building
society market.
Mr Michael Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, in explaining why the tie had
to be abandoned, said:
'It's to do with control over the manufacturing process. We are particularly
concerned that our competitors have more flexibility than we do.'
Until recently the Halifax had been privately urging the Securities and
Investments Board to consider allowing 'multi-tying', which would have
enabled it to have different exclusive arrangements for different products.
Mr Blackburn declined to speculate about whether the Halifax would have
preferred multi-tying to starting its own insurance company, saying there
was no prospect of rule changes in any event.
But Mr Wriglesworth said there was little doubt about the Halifax's
prefer-ence.
'I don't think this would have happened if they could have had ties with
several providers,' he said.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Insurance ties of the top 10 societies
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Halifax: tied to Standard Life but, from late 1994 it will sell only
  products from its own subsidiary, Halifax Life
 -Nationwide: tied to Guardian Royal Exchange
 -Leeds Permanent (to be formed by merger between Leeds and National
  and Provincial): Leeds will sever its tie to Norwich Union next
  spring. The combined society will sell products of a wholly-owned
  insurance subsidiary
 -Woolwich: tied to own subsidiary, Woolwich Life
 -Alliance and Leicester: tied to Scottish Amicable
 -Cheltenham and Gloucester: tied to Legal and General but from November
  it will offer no retail financial services at all

FT  04 SEP 93 / Tractor makers gain benefits of ERM departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRACTOR manufacturers are enjoying an increasing share of the windfall for
UK farmers' incomes provided by the exit of sterling from the European
Community's exchange rate mechanism last autumn.
Figures published yesterday by the Agricultural Engineers' Association show
that UK registrations of tractors above 40hp totalled 2,741 units in August,
up 40.6 per cent from the same month last year, taking the total for the
year so far to 11,983 units, up 24 per cent.
Mr Chris Evans, the association's economist, said the sharp rise had to be
viewed against the background of extremely depressed sales in preceding
years as farmers' incomes slumped to historic lows in real terms. Last year
UK tractor sales were the lowest on record, he said.
Reform of the EC's common agricultural policy had already brightened the
outlook for farmers before sterling left the ERM and the 'green pound' - the
artificial exchange rate at which EC-guaranteed farm prices are translated
into sterling - was devalued by 20 per cent, Mr Evans said. Although
subsequent revaluation of the green pound had reduced farmers' gains, many
still found themselves with money to invest in machinery for the first time
in years.
The rise in spending on machinery was exaggerated by the fact that much
machinery was overdue for replacement, Mr Evans said, while some purchases
might have been brought forward to benefit from a 40 per cent tax allowance
on farm equipment, which is being reduced to 25 per cent from the end of
October. He thought strong demand for tractors would continue at least until
then.
The National Farmers' Union agreed that the financial position of UK farmers
was better than for some time. It cautioned, however, that investment plans
should be considered 'with great care' in view of the uncertainties
associated with the progress of agricultural policy reform and the impact on
farm incomes of any eventual settlement in the general agreement on tariffs
and trade.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Peres joins direct talks with PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, yesterday held talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation aimed at finalising the wording of a PLO
statement paving the way to mutual recognition.
Israeli and PLO officials said Mr Peres and his aides, assisted by three
Norwegian mediators led by Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the foreign minister,
were talking to the PLO directly in Paris and by telephone to PLO
headquarters in Tunis. There was speculation that Mr Peres and the
Norwegians, who were staying in the same hotel, were in contact with Mr
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the PLO moderate who initialled last week's draft
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement in Norway.
In Jerusalem Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, stopping short of
publicly uttering the words 'PLO', said he was ready to make 'painful
compromises' for peace with the former revolutionary organisation.
'In general peace is not made with friends. Peace is made with enemies, some
of whom - and I won't name names - I loathe very much.'
But in Tunis Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, was battling against stiff
opposition to convince his colleagues to accept the wording of a statement
in which the PLO would suspend its charter, renounce violence and recognise
Israel's right to exist.
PLO officials said Mr Arafat was delaying approval of the peace agreement on
interim self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
until he gets mutual recognition so he can deflect mounting criticism within
Palestinian ranks. Mr Arafat hopes Israeli-PLO recognition will be followed
shortly afterwards by US recognition of the PLO. Palestinian extremists both
inside and outside the occupied territories have denounced Mr Arafat's plan.
Hamas, the fundamentalist group which rejects negotiations with Israel,
admitted shooting an Israeli soldier near Hebron on Thursday. Hamas said the
attack was part of a campaign against Israel and the US which it accused of
'trying to humiliate and intimidate our people' and 'liquidate our cause'.
In southern Lebanon hundreds of Palestinian refugees demonstrated,
describing Mr Arafat's acceptance of the deal as 'treason, humiliation and
shame'.
Israeli troops shot and wounded four Arabs in the occupied Gaza Strip
yesterday, three of them at a Moslem fundamentalist rally. Soldiers in the
Jabalya refugee camp fired on an Islamic Jihad procession of more than 1,000
demonstrators chanting, 'Death to Israel, death to America'. Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, yesterday offered to send
peacekeeping troops to the Gaza Strip and Jericho following an Israeli
military withdrawal under the peace agreement.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Chancellor's ally hits at Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria and a key ally of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, yesterday urged Mr Kohl to abandon support for a fast-track
European integration under the Maastricht treaty because it risked
alienating voters.
In a letter to the chancellor published in the conservative newspaper die
Welt, Mr Stoiber warned that 'the majority of voters could no longer be won
by assuming their general creed towards Europe'.
The letter comes as his Christian Social Union launches into open battle
with rival far-right Republicans. There are municipal elections in Bavaria
this month and state elections next spring.
The Republicans, who are strongest in Germany's southern states, believe
they will enter the federal parliament next year by tapping into growing
anti-Maastricht feelings.
In his letter, Mr Stoiber wrote: 'I believe the development of Europe as a
state parallel to or above European states, which you are pushing for, is
the wrong way and could destroy the process of European integration rather
than cement it.'
He welcomed the chancellor's suggestion that European monetary union could
be delayed 'by a year or two' as a result of the crisis in the exchange rate
mechanism.
The Bavarian premier said he opposed a single European currency as 'much too
ambitious'.
He urged Germany to open a debate at the October EC summit on reforming EC
institutions to make them more transparent and accountable.

FT  04 SEP 93 / How the secret deal was hatched: Only Peres' private coterie
knew of talks with PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE clandestine Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organisation dialogue which
hatched the draft peace agreement in Norway was kept so secret that even
Israel's leading negotiator with the Palestinians was in the dark.
Mr Elyarkim Rubenstein, Israel's hawkish cabinet secretary and chief
negotiator with the Palestinians, was yesterday still considering his
resignation. He said he was outraged at being frozen out of the
negotiations.
Foreign ministry officials in Jerusalem have said that only a tiny bunch of
officials loyal to Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, were in on the
talks. Known in Jerusalem as 'The Blazers' because of their penchant for
dark blue jackets, they include Mr Yossi Beilin, the dovish deputy foreign
minister, Mr Uri Savir, the director-general of the ministry and Mr Yoel
Singer, the ministry's legal adviser who was brought in to the talks three
weeks ago to help in the delicate drafting of a peace agreement.
Mr Nimrod Novic, a special personal adviser to Mr Peres was also involved.
All of them have long been closely associated with the 'Peres Camp' and one
senior official described them yesterday as 'an exclusive club of people'.
Israeli officials say the critical input from the PLO was provided by Mr
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) head of the PLO's pan-Arab and international
section, a key moderate and a close adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman. Another vital PLO official involved was Mr Abu Ala, head of the
PLO economics section, an Arafat loyalist and designer of a huge investment
plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip after peace.
The Israelis and Palestinians were assisted by a five-strong Norwegian team
led by Mr Johan Joergan Holst, foreign minister. In all 14 meetings took
place on Norwegian farms and in private homes between January and August and
the Norwegians played a critical role travelling to PLO headquarters in
Tunis to meet Mr Arafat. According to Israeli officials Mr Peres only
stepped into the talks when a document was all but ready to be initialled
last week.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was aware of the secret dialogue
but his government continued to deny it was happening. Prime ministerial
aides said Mr Rabin believed the dialogue was worth pursuing but he did not
expect it to yield results and continued pressing forward with talks with
Palestinian negotiators from the occupied territories who, like their
Israeli counterparts, were kept in the dark.
A turning point came after the collapse of the tenth round of talks in June.
Mr Rabin, aides said, began to realise that the negotiators from the PLO in
Tunis might be more moderate and willing to strike a deal than the
negotiators from the territories. Mr Rabin, however, continued to keep the
talks under cover in case they failed and were exposed so that he could
plausibly deny any involvement.

<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINES' economy, mostly stagnant since 1990, registered growth of
1.8 per cent in the first half of the year, according to government data
released yesterday.
The first-half growth, reported by the National Statistical Co-ordination
Board, dispels fears of prolonged stagnation resulting from severe power
cuts in Manila and the main Luzon island since October 1992.
The growth rate was boosted by a sustained inflow of remittances from
Filipino workers abroad. Without the workers' remittances, gross domestic
product grew by only 0.7 per cent, although that was still an improvement
over the first-half economic performance of the past two years. In the first
half of 1992, for instance, GDP declined by 0.13 per cent.
The best performer was the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector, which
posted a 2.5 per cent expansion. The industrial sector, however, declined
1.5 per cent in the half year mainly because of the power shortage.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Australian dollar plunges amid budget wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian dollar plunged to its lowest levels for six and a half years
yesterday amid vicious political wrangling over the Keating goverment's
budget proposals, announced earlier this month, and a strike by 20,000 coal
miners.
Overseas investors and speculators drove the currency down to USDollars
0.6550 in overnight trading on Thursday, and the Australian dollar then
closed in Sydney at USDollars 0.6528 yesterday - the lowest level seen since
1987.
The dollar's fall came despite intervention by the Reserve Bank of
Australia, which started around the Dollars 0.6635 mark and continued down
to Dollars 0.6560. The fall was attributed partly to a slide in the bullion
price and generally weaker commodity prices.
However, uncertainty over of the final shape of the government's budget
strategy and the failure of the coalminers to return to workalso contributed
to the nervousness surrounding the currency.
The budget plan has stalled in the face of opposition in the Australian
senate, where it needs support from the minority Democrat and Green Party
senators to pass. Earlier this week, the government announced modifications
including an increased tax rebate for low income earners and a reduced
differential between leaded and unleaded petrol - which won qualified
support from the Democrats.
Meanwhile, coal miners in New South Wales and Queensland, who began a
five-day strike on Wednesday night to protest against price-cutting by
exporting companies, continued their industrial action yesterday despite
calls from the Coal Industry Tribunal to return to work.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Yield on benchmark US bond falls to 16-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE yield on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell to 5.97 per cent in
trading yesterday, the first time in its 16-year history it had broken
through the psychologically significant 6 per cent barrier, after weaker
than expected employment figures pointed to continuing sluggish growth.
The yield was 8.6 per cent as recently as 1990 but has since fallen steadily
as recession and sluggish economic growth led to a downward revision of
long-term inflation expectations. The trend to lower long-term yields gained
further momentum late last year as it became clear that the Clinton
administration intended to pass deficit-cutting fiscal legislation.
The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment fell 39,000 to 110.3m
last month, a sign that economic growth is likely to remain moderate.
Analysts had expected a gain in payroll employment of about 150,000.
Separately, the Commerce Department said the index of leading economic
indicators - a guide to future economic activity - fell 0.1 per cent in
July, reversing a 0.1 per cent gain in June.
The official unemployment rate, however, fell from 6.8 per cent to 6.7 per
cent in August, the lowest level in two years. The jobless rate is based on
a survey of household employment that is more erratic than payroll jobs
data; the household measure of employment rose 409,000 last month. The
apparent weakness of payroll employment last month was partly offset by
revisions to data for July showing a gain of 211,000 rather than the 162,000
initially reported. Payroll employment has risen substantially since
Christmas and is more than 2m above the trough reached in February 1992.
Manufacturing employment fell 42,000 to 17.7m last month the lowest level
since 1965. Manufacturers have shed 240,000 jobs in the past six months.
Service industries such as health care continued to create jobs but at a
slower pace than in recent months.
The decline in leading indicators continued a choppy path for the index this
year. Seven of 11 components pointed to economic contraction; four to
economic expansion. Recent movements of the index are consistent with
sluggish growth.

FT  04 SEP 93 / US funds descend on China

REPRESENTATIVES of American pension funds with portfolios worth Dollars
500bn will converge on the Chinese capital Beijing next week in search of
new investment opportunities in what is regarded as one of the world's more
challenging 'emerging markets.'
Mr Philip Schaefer, organiser of the conference, said yesterday that now
American pension funds were permitted to invest 10 per cent of their
portfolios internationally there was growing demand for fresh investment
possibilities in countries like China.
The vogue for foreign investment in China has outstripped the growth of the
market. Far from lacking an inflow of foreign capital, China's nascent
markets are finding it hard to accommodate demand.
Some 100 representatives of pension funds, whose portfolios amount to about
an eighth of all pension fund money in the US, will discuss such issues as
China's regulatory environment, and development strategies with senior
Chinese officials from state banks and from key policy agencies.
As in other emerging markets, a raft of specialist country funds were set
up, following the creation of B shares for foreign investors 18 months ago.
Because of the complexities of the market, most institutional fund managers
prefer to use specialist country-fund managers.
'Six months ago, the total market value of funds available to invest in B
shares was twice the market capitalisation of B shares,' said Mr Kenneth
King, head of international investment at Kleinwort Investment Management in
London. This means that few funds are fully invested in China, with many
using Hong Kong shares as proxies.
In addition, some investors have been deterred by the volatility of the
market in B shares which has 'doubled and halved twice in less than two
years of life,' he said.
There has also been growing interest in investing in Chinese debt. The
People's Republic of China is preparing to return to the Eurobond market
with a Y30bn (Pounds 188m) offering via Nomura.
Some US major institutions remain wary. Mr De Witt Bowman, chief investment
officer of the California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest
public pension fund in the US, said it was not investing in China 'because
we don't feel the public markets are well enough developed, and the private
markets are very much insiders' markets' for those with the contacts.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Japan's surplus rises by 24.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus rose 24.9 per cent to Dollars 11.8bn in
July, the 28th consecutive month of year-on-year increases, highlighting the
pressure on the new coalition government to stimulate domestic demand in the
hope of reducing the surplus.
The continuing expansion of the surplus comes as the Bank of Japan is
apparently considering a reduction in the official discount rate (ODR) from
the present 2.5 per cent, if only to bolster the confidence of consumers and
Japanese companies, which are cutting capital investment this year.
Rumours of an ODR cut next week circulated in financial markets yesterday,
following a comment by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, that a
rate reduction was not needed to halt yen appreciation. Some brokers
interpreted his choice of words as a sign that a cut may be needed to
stimulate the economy.
In July, the surplus in Japan's trade account rose 22.3 per cent to Dollars
13.89bn (Pounds 9.10bn), and the finance ministry blamed the increase on the
yen's strength during the month. Seasonally adjusted, the current account
surplus rose from Dollars 8.9bn in June to Dollars 11.2bn in July.
The long-term capital account showed a deficit of Dollars 4.4bn, compared to
a surplus of Dollars 260m in the same month last year, while the overall
balance of payments had a surplus of Dollars 5.2bn, against a surplus of
Dollars 8.5bn a year earlier.
Japanese investors were net purchasers of Dollars 1.38bn in foreign shares,
compared to Dollars 1.24bn in the previous month, while they were sellers of
Dollars 692m in foreign bonds, compared to net sales of Dollars 3.04bn in
June.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday appealed for public support for his
government's plan to reform the German economy and improve its
competitiveness as the August unemployment rate stayed for a second month at
its highest level this year.
Mr Kohl urged Germans to change their values and endorse a far-ranging
government paper which proposes to privatise and deregulate the economy and
reform the country's social security system. The 96-page document, drafted
by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, received cabinet backing on
Thursday night. It will form the basis of new laws to be presented to
parliament this autumn and next spring.
'We are calling above all on each and every one for a change in their
attitudes and thinking. Well-established habits must be checked and new
priorities must be set,' Mr Kohl said.
Spelling out why reforms of the country's generous social security system
were needed, Mr Kohl said: 'With so much studying, careers beginning at 30
and people retiring at 60, the bill just doesn't add up when life expectancy
is 80,' Mr Kohl said. 'You cannot expect the system, ladies and gentlemen,
to function for ever,' he said.
His comments were made as figures were released showing West Germany's
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate last month stood unchanged against
July at 7.5 per cent. The number of people out of work in both the western
and eastern parts of the country remained at 3.5m.
While unemployment fell marginally in the west, with 10,600 people finding
work, the jobless rate in the east climbed to 15.4 per cent against 15.3 per
cent in July.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Aspin blueprint marks shift in national security strategy:
Why the 'Bottom-Up' review of the US forces may exceed expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Bill Clinton picked Mr Les Aspin to be defence secretary,
many doubted that he would have the managerial skills to run an organisation
as byzantine, as ossified and as resistant to change as the Pentagon.
A rumpled academic with degrees from Yale, Oxford and the Massachussetts
Institute of Technology, and 22 years in Congress, Mr Aspin this week laid
out a blueprint for the US armed forces which suggests that he may exceed
expectations. His Bottom-Up Review, replete with charts so incomprehensible
they could only come from the Pentagon, draws on all the number-crunching
power at the disposal of military planners. Yet it carries Mr Aspin's
professorial stamp in its echoes of a slim discussion paper on force options
he produced a year ago when he was chairman of the House of Representatives
Armed Services committee.
The review has already been challenged both as too timid in its effort to
reduce the country's cold war armed forces and as too harsh and likely to
leave the forces demoralised and debilitated.
But it has also been hailed as the most thorough intellectual analysis to
date of what tasks the US needs to prepare its armed forces for.
The intellectual underpinning of the review represents a dramatic shift away
from the national security strategy produced under former President George
Bush in August 1991 - when Desert Storm was just concluded and the Soviet
Union still existed - which has guided military planners until now.
'The size and orientation of Soviet military forces must therefore remain
critical concerns to the United States and the overall health of the
European system will still require a counterweight to Soviet military
strength,' the White House national strategy statement declared. Two years
later, the Bottom-Up Review bases its assessment of force needs on the
principle that the US should be able to win two nearly simultaneous major
regional conflicts - a radical redefinition of the threats facing the
country.
Mr Aspin adds proliferation of nuclear weapons, an eventual undermining of
US economic strength, and the possible failure of reform in the former
Soviet bloc to his list of threats, but says regional dangers are the most
crucial in determining the size and shape of future US forces.
'This one is the most important in terms of deciding the size of the defence
budget,' he said.
To be able to win a single big regional conflict, the Pentagon calculates
that it would need eight active army divisions, along with six reserve
divisions; eight carrier battlegroups; five active marine brigades; and 10
active fighter wings, together with six reserve wings.
To win one such conflict while containing another until forces could be
diverted from the first - a strategy known as 'win-hold-win' which had the
favour of some budget planners at the White House - would require two more
army divisions, two more carrier groups and three more fighter wings.
Mr Aspin's choice of winning in two nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts adds only one more carrier group and another reserve carrier, but
it requires significant changes in the type of forces and weaponry that can
be brought to bear.
These 'enhancements' to the type of forces include elements such as
improving the navy's F-14 Tomcats to allow them to carry out ground attacks;
adding more smart weapons to the arsenal; and radically overhauling the way
army reserves are organised so that they can be made ready for combat much
more quickly than proved possible in the Gulf War.
The review also reflects some of Mr Aspin's position papers from his days in
Congress in its approach to the defence industry: it proposes the
construction of a third Seawolf submarine not because it is needed, but to
preserve at least one nuclear submarine yard, and to proceed with the
upgrading of about 200 M-1 tanks over the next three years to keep open the
only tank manufacturing plant in the country.
Mr Aspin's review was supposed to be conducted from the bottom up, rather
than as an exercise in trimming the force structure to fit an already
determined budget number, and he has declined to give any overall budget
figure until next week. But the plan risks criticism from both wings of
Congress, where budget numbers are the most important currency.
It has already been derided by some as cutting only a couple of army
divisions and one aircraft carrier group from the force designed under Mr
Bush in 1991, and attacked by others as accelerating a ruinous round of
defence cuts that has impaired morale and left US troops stretched too
thinly. Between the two, it has been criticised as unaffordable within the
Dollars 1,280bn Mr Clinton has budgeted for defence over the next five
years.
Perhaps the harshest criticism, however, is that the Bottom-Up Review is
just a theoretical construct with little chance of being implemented in
detail against the resistance of Pentagon bureaucrats and of Mr Aspin's
former colleagues in Congress, who will be sure to pick away at every
element of it.
If the implementation of the Bottom-Up Review can live up to its
intellectual promise, then Mr Aspin will truly have made the jump from the
senior common room.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Romania struggles to secure IMF standby agreement:
Unemployment and strikes are continuing to plague the government's flagging
reform efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROMANIAN delegation leaves for Washingon this weekend in a last-ditch
attempt to secure a 1993 standby agreement with the International Monetary
Fund and restore confidence in the country's flagging reform efforts.
A successful outcome to the talks would unlock some Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn)
in badly-needed foreign credits and boost the fragile minority government of
Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, which is coming under increasing attack from opposition
parties, trade unions and its own political supporters.
Opposition parties have stepped up their criticism of the government
following last weekend's cabinet reshuffle which saw the removal of four
ministers including Mr Misu Negritoiu, who was considered the government's
key reformer.
Opposition leaders say the reshuffle will do nothing to improve the
cabinet's ability to govern and have lodged a parliamentary motion demanding
the removal of the finance and interior ministers and the goverment's chief
of staff, who have all been named in a corruption scandal sparked off by the
dismissal of the head of the Financial Guard.
Nationalist parties, on whom the ruling party, the recently renamed Social
Democracy party of Romania (SDPR), relies to stay in power, have been
angered at their failure to secure a cabinet post and are threatening to
withdraw their support. Mr Gheorghe Funar, the fiery nationalist mayor of
Cluj in the north-west, has also threatened to seek the impeachment of
President Ion Iliescu if bilingual signs are introduced in ethnically mixed
areas such as Transylvania. But Romania's application for imminent
membership of the Council of Europe has been tied to improved treatment of
the country's ethnic minorities.
The government also faces increased labour militancy in the wake of two
significant strikes last month. The industry ministry says more stoppages
are inevitable. 'Workers will only feel the full effect of this summer's
price hikes when they receive their winter heat and food bills,' an official
said. Recent price liberalisation has added to triple digit inflation and
the biggest price rises since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in 1989.
If the government, under pressure from the IMF and World Bank, restructures
state enterprises, workers will soon also face mass unemployment for the
first time. Until now only a quarter of the 1m unemployed, 9 per cent of the
workforce, have lost their jobs through forced redundancy, according to the
unions.
Politically the SDPR, which won last year's elections by promising slower
and less painful reforms, has not prepared the country for the hard times
which lie ahead. A privatisation official said: 'In May, the government
falsely said it could cover subsidy cuts '100 per cent' through pay
increases. Then, it helped provoke both the recent miners' and train
drivers' strikes by promising pay awards which it later realised it could
not afford.'
The train drivers' strike collapsed last month after its union's telephone
lines were cut and state radio and television broadcast government
statements saying that workers at most depots had returned to work.
Witnesses later said this was false.
Mr Miron Mitrea, joint president of the pro-reform CNSLR-Fratia
confederation which, with 3.7m members, represents more than a third of the
workforce, says: 'The government was not in close contact with the train
drivers. It thought it could stop the strike by declaring it illegal, as it
does with all strikes.' The government also repeatedy misrepresented the
miners' demands during the recent coal miners' strike.
That strike ended after the state owned Jiu Valley coal company, which
includes a representative of the ministry of industry, partially caved in to
the miners' pay demands. Rather than acknowledging this the prime minister
said the strike had achived nothing and that the miners had been forced to
go ack to work on the govenment's terms.
Once details of the settlement were known, the minister of industry declared
the RAH's agreement with the union void. Mr Miron Cosma, the miners' leader,
has now begun legal proceedings to have the minister's decision reversed. He
is also threatening to launch a new strike.

CRIMINAL investigators probing the suspected theft of General Motors'
industrial secrets by Volkswagen executives plan to question Mr Ferdinand
Piech, group chairman.
He and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the company's production director
at the centre of the investigation, would be interrogated 'as sure as they
say 'amen' in church,' the Darmstadt prosecutors' office said yesterday.
But legal officials would first have to complete their examination of a haul
of documents and computerised information seized from the vehicle group's
Wolfsburg headquarters in a raid on August 26.
The office recently suggested Mr Piech would not be called because, a
spokesman said, 'he is not a suspect'.
An interim report on a private probe within VW, presented to the group's
supervisory board yesterday, contained 'no findings to warrant industrial
espionage accusations,' the company said in a statement last night.
Officials said after an all-day meeting of the board that Mr Piech and Mr
Lopez would not be leaving.
The investigations involving Mr Lopez and three associates, who left the
General Motors group in March, are primarily concerned with suspicions of
the systematic theft of secrets from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
The supervisory board, which appoints and oversees the work of executive
directors, was also told yesterday that group profits in 1993 could be
adversely affected by poor performances at the Seat subsidiary in Spain and
in north American and Asian-Pacific markets. However, the German parent and
the group would show a profit in the third quarter after a DM1.6bn (Pounds
646m) loss in the first half.
The statement issued after the board session once again showed signs of a
retreat from earlier declarations that the company would break even or
return to profit this year, and that Mr Lopez would remain until he had been
found guilty.
The supervisory board also reinstated Mr Ulrich Seiffert as main board
research and development director with immediate effect. He was removed in
mid-March on the same day Mr Lopez was appointed.
The VW supervisory board, which appointed auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand on
August 13 to carry out an independent probe, said yesterday it expected a
full report by the end of October.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Balladur's popularity rises despite economic problems
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S unemployment rate is at 11.7 per cent and rising. Two of the
government's principal policies - a strong franc and European union - have
been undermined by the crisis within Europe's exchange rate mechanism. But
polls released this week show Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is
more popular than ever.
A survey to be published today in Le Point, the weekly magazine, finds that
Mr Balladur is the only conservative politician who would beat left-wing
rivals in presidential elections scheduled for 1995.
According to the poll, Mr Balladur would beat Mr Jacques Delors, the
socialist European Commission president by 67 per cent to 33 per cent in an
election.
He would defeat Mr Michel Rocard, the probable socialist candidate, by 69
per cent to 31 per cent.
Equally significantly, a Louis Harris poll published in the Globe Hebdo
magazine earlier this week, showed Mr Balladur was much more popular than Mr
Jacques Chirac, leader of the prime minister's Gaullist RPR party.
According to the poll, 67 per cent believed Mr Balladur had a better chance
of being elected president in 1995 and 62 per cent thought he would do a
better job than Mr Chirac.
Most political analysts believe the explanation for the prime minister's
popularity is a result of his competent image and his unflappable nature in
the face of problems ranging from the European currency crisis to the
recession-hit French economy.
They also point to the peaceful 'cohabitation' between Mr Balladur and
France's socialist president Francois Mitterrand.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday rejected President Boris Yeltsin's decree
suspending Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi from his functions and referred
the move to the constitutional court, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
If found to be unconstitutional, the controversial presidential decree could
open the way for the Congress of People's Deputies, or full parliament, to
impeach Mr Yeltsin under a 'poison pill' amendment which is supposed to be
triggered by any presidential act violating the constitution.
The parliament's response, an inevitable and predictable escalation of the
political struggle in Moscow, must have been expected by the president when
he issued his decree on Wednesday.
Although Mr Yeltsin insisted yesterday that he had done nothing to violate
the constitution, it is probable that the president is past caring as he
struggles to deal a final blow to parliament and to his vice-president. Mr
Rutskoi, who has been the standard-bearer of the opposition, said yesterday
he was starting a 'pre-campaign' for presidential elections.
Mr Oleg Lobov, a first deputy prime minister who is particularly close to
the president, said that Mr Yeltsin plans to use a new Federation Council to
bypass parliament in order to obtain a new constitution and new elections.
He proposes to abolish the vice-presidential post by making no provision for
it in the new constitution.
The Council, for which the legal documents were now being drawn up, would
act as a 'weighty state organ to approve major legislation on the way Russia
is run,' he told a news conference yesterday.
Also predictably, the parliament left intact that part of the presidential
decree which suspended Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister
who like the vice-president has been accused of profiting from state imports
of baby food. Mr Yeltsin said he was suspending both men temporarily until
the allegations were sorted out.
But the growing breach within the Russian cabinet over economic reform was
amply illustrated by Mr Lobov's public demand for big changes in the
government's mass privatisation programme. He said Russia should cut the
amount of state property to be given away for privatisation vouchers and
sell more for cash to raise budget revenues and provide more state funds for
industrial investment. Under amendments it passed yesterday in defiance of a
presidential veto, the Russian parliament gave itself and local parliaments
the right to supervise media programmes.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has opened a full inquiry into the proposed
acquisition of Societa Italiana Vetro, Italian state glass company, by
Pilkington, UK glass group, and Techint Finanziaria, its Italian-Argentine
partner, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The L210bn (Pounds 87m) deal will be suspended for up to four months, while
the Commission's merger control task force assesses its impact on
competition in the EC. The buyers provided for regulatory delays when
drawing up the purchase contract.
If the Commission decides the takeover is anti-competitive it could ask for
changes to the deal or block it outright. Brussels has only outlawed one
proposed merger in the three years since the EC merger regulation took
effect.
The Brussels authorities did not explain their initial doubts about the
deal. Following a month-long preliminary investigation, the Commission said
the merger would cut the number of 'major Community (flat glass) suppliers'
to five, and give Pilkington a position very close to the market leader,
Saint Gobain of France.
The sale of SIV is the first large disposal in the liquidation of Efim, the
Italian state holding company. It would raise Pilkington's profile in Italy
and Spain and strengthen its position in automotive glass. SIV is the
biggest European producer of car glass.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Hungary reburies its wartime leader: The mixed emotions
raised by the return of Miklos Horthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY in eastern Europe has a disturbing tendency to rise up from the
grave to haunt the living. Hungary's deceased leaders make a particular
habit of it.
The latest is Miklos Horthy, disinterred from his resting place in
Portuguese exile, who is to be grandly reburied today in the family tomb at
Kenderes in the great plain of Hungary.
While generally one of the more forward-looking of the new democracies,
Hungary has a rather morbid practice of digging up and then reburying
long-dead leaders.
The reburial of nationalist communist Laszlo Rajk marked the end of
Stalinist terror. That of Imre Nagy, prime minister during the failed 1956
uprising against Soviet occupation, signalled the bankruptcy of communist
rule in Hungary in 1989.
There is also a touch of the comic to the figure of Horthy, the sailor on a
white horse, admiral of a country without a sea, and regent of a kingdom
without a king. Nevertheless, nearly 40 years after his death, Horthy
remains a powerful and controversial symbol.
Anti-semite, war criminal, Nazi ally, revisionist and moral coward to some
Hungarians, he was above all a tragic hero, noble anti-communist and patriot
to others, including the governing conservatives.
Critics of Horthy say he allied with Nazi Germany; his defenders counter
that he preserved Hungary's tattered sovereignty - and the lives of many
Jewish refugees - for as long as he could.
Horthy stood by as German occupation forces in 1944 transported hundreds of
thousands of rural Jews to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps; but he
blocked the deportation of Budapest's Jews.
'I consider Miklos Horthy a Hungarian patriot ..he should be placed into the
continuity of the nation and the awareness of the people,' says Mr Jozsef
Antall, Hungary's prime minister.
Today's ceremony in Kenderes is not an official state funeral. But many
ministers will attend nevertheless and state television plans live coverage.
The state mint has even issued coins to commemorate the event.
But liberal and Jewish groups are outraged at the public homage to a ruler
they say acquiesced in persecution of Hungary's Jews.
For the Horthy reburial has touched nerves already frayed by the recent
formation of the far-right Hungarian Justice Party by anti-semitic writer
Istvan Csurka. Jewish organisations protested yesterday against the 'revival
of the spirit of the inter-war years' outside the ghetto memorial to the
600,000 Hungarian victims of the Holocaust.
At the same time the Democratic Charter, a liberal group led by some of
Hungary's prominent intellectuals, bade a 'final farewell' to the Horthy
system.
Horthy's attitude towards Hungary's Jews may have been ambiguous. There is
less room, however, to interpret the Regent's singleminded campaign to
reverse the Trianon peace settlement which took away two-thirds of Hungarian
territory after defeat in the First World War.
The Regent's alliance with Hitler allowed him to regain territories from
Slovakia, Romania and then Yugoslavia between 1938 and 1941.
Hungary is in its neighbours' eyes, therefore, honouring the arch
'revisionist' and underlining its current reluctance to enshrine existing
borders in bilateral treaties.
'It feeds suspicion about what Hungary's real aims are,' says Miklos
Haraszti, MP of the opposition liberal Free Democrats.
Suspicion is all it is, say conservatives, who deny any territorial
ambitions and reject charges that the reburial of Horthy is insensitive.
'We must be allowed some patriotic feelings: we can't ask every day what the
reactions of Romanians, Slovaks and Yugoslavs are going to be,' says Istvan
Bethlen, MP of the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum.
For supporters of the public reburial of Horthy, the last line of defence is
that the Regent was part of Hungary's past. 'It is something that had to be
done,' says state secretary Tamas Katona. 'We are paying homage to a quarter
of a century of Hungarian history.' Some would prefer to forget.

THE BELGIAN central bank again intervened on the currency markets yesterday
to support the Belgian franc, but failed to prevent a further slide in its
value against the D-Mark, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The currency closed at BFr21.77 against the D-Mark yesterday compared with
BFr21.455 on Thursday evening. A spokeswoman for the central bank said no
special announcements were planned for the weekend.
Some foreign exchange dealers were suggesting yesterday that the authorities
might announce abandonment of the strong link between the franc and the
D-Mark before trading reopened on Monday. The bank said a weekend
devaluation was 'impossible'.
Mr Yves Mersch, director of the Luxembourg treasury, said yesterday there
was 'absolutely no reason' for a devaluation. The Luxembourg and Belgian
franc are part of a currency union.
On Thursday, the Belgian bank threw its full weight behind the 'franc fort'
policy by raising official interest rates by one percentage point and
intervening on the currency markets. The bank has blamed misleading press
reports for making the Belgian franc an attractive target for speculation.

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Diego Curto, one of the most senior judges in the Milan judicial system,
was yesterday arrested on charges of corruption linked to the 'Enimont'
affair.
His arrest followed well-publicised leaks from Milan investigating
magistrates that he had allegedly accepted a bribe of L320m (Pounds 133,000)
as a result of his role in the complex judicial proceedings surrounding the
reorganisation of the chemicals industry in 1990.
It is the first time a leading judicial figure in northern Italy has been
arrested since the corruption scandals came to light 16 months ago. One of
the most disturbing features of the allegations is that he was purportedly
receiving money as late as July this year.
The arrest sheds further light on the murky events surrounding the end of
Enimont, the chemicals' venture between the Ferruzzi group's Montedison and
ENI, the state oil concern.
Mr Curto, a Sicilian-born judge who has written seven novels, has been under
investigation since the beginning of August. His arrest follows the reported
confession of Mr Vincenzo Palladino, former deputy chairman of the major
state commercial bank, Comit.
Mr Palladino, a political appointee at Comit of the Socialist Party, was
arrested on charges of corruption on July 29 and released by Milan
magistrates from jail to house arrest on Wednesday. Mr Palladino played a
crucial role in the battle for control of Enimont when Mr Raul Gardini, the
former head of Montedison, sought to obtain a controlling stake through
friendly third party shareholders.
Mr Gardini's move was blocked by the Milan courts on the orders of Mr Curto,
who froze dealings in the shares in November 1990. The shares were then
placed under the tutelage of Mr Palladino for 22 days.
During this period a deal was worked out between Mr Gardini on the one hand
and ENI and its political masters on the other. This allowed ENI to purchase
Montedison's 40 per cent stake for an inflated L2,800bn and that of the
third parties for L1,400bn. Out of the inflated price Mr Gardini is alleged
to have paid at least L120bn in bribes, mainly to the Socialists and
Christian Democrats.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Spain cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut its key intervention rate by half a point to
10 per cent, signalling its confidence that the government will persuade
unions to limit wage rises and that the recession could have bottomed out.
The decision also reflected a strong performance by the peseta that has
given the monetary authorities considerable room to manoeuvre.
Boosted by foreign purchases of Spanish debt and equities, the currency has
risen by almost 4 per cent against the D-Mark in the past few weeks and is
within its old exchange rate band before the European Monetary System
crisis.
The cut prompted most private banks to bring down lending to prime borrowers
by between 25 and 50 basis points to between 10 and 11 per cent. Lending
rates are now at their cheapest since the early 1980s.
The key factor in the cut appeared to be the expectation of a three-year
'social pact' wage agreement. Negotiations with the unions opened this week
and are expected to be completed in time for the government to present a
restrictive budget to parliament at the end of the month.
A second cause is likely to have been the Bank of Spain's guarded belief
that recovery could be close. The Bank's first-half report noted that
certain indicators suggested the recession had touched bottom.
Some analysts were, however, surprised by the boldness of the rate cut.
Arguing that wage restraint was not yet in place, that government borrowing
requirements were high and that inflation remained stubbornly above 4.5 per
cent, Mr Frederick Artessani, director of equities at Madrid securities
house Benito y Monjardin, said the central bank 'might have had its arm
twisted by the government.'

THE United Nations yesterday warned that almost 3m people would need shelter
in Bosnia this winter if the warring sides failed to reach a peace
settlement to end the 17-month war.
There are now 1m more displaced refugees and affected people in Bosnia than
this time last year, Mr Santiago Romero Perez, UN High Commissioner for
Refugees spokesman said yesterday.
Although 2.28m people in Bosnia are now dependent on food aid, the UNHCR
only managed to deliver 53 per cent of requirements during the first seven
months this year, he added.
His comments come as UN officials warned there could be an upsurge in
fighting in Bosnia following the collapse on Wednesday of the latest round
of Geneva peace talks. But as the three sides in the conflict pondered their
next moves yesterday, the UN protection force in Zagreb reported that Bosnia
remained relatively quiet.
With the international mediators insisting the three sides had been very
close to a settlement, hopes remain that the parties will eventually be
persuaded to return to talks.
One US official yesterday said: 'If you look at the details they are much
closer than they have been before - these are quite small bits of land they
are talking about.'
Since the talks broke down, western governments, led by the US, have stepped
up pressure on Serb and Croat leaders to give in to Moslem demands for
further territory.
The key sticking points are the Moslem demands for a sea outlet to the
Adriatic at Neum, an enlargement of the northern Moslem enclave of Bihac,
and a land link between Sarajevo and the eastern Moslem enclaves.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is anxious to reach a settlement to win
the lifting of sanctions imposed 15 months ago to punish Serbia for its
violent division of Bosnia. However Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, yesterday brushed aside a US warning that Nato could intervene with
air strikes if fighting escalated.
US and British officials have threatened to impose sanctions on Croatia for
Bosnia's partition. But Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatian president, on Thursday
appeared intransigent when his Council for Defence and National Security
rejected the Moslem demand for access through the Croat mini-state to Neum,
a fishing village on Bosnia's patch of Adriatic coast.

CRIMINAL investigators probing the suspected theft of General Motors'
industrial secrets by Volkswagen executives plan to question Mr Ferdinand
Piech, group chairman.
He and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the company's production director
at the centre of the investigation, would be interrogated 'as sure as they
say 'amen' in church,' the Darmstadt prosecutors' office said yesterday.
But legal officials would first have to complete their examination of a haul
of documents and computerised information seized from the vehicle group's
Wolfsburg headquarters in a raid on August 26.
The office recently suggested Mr Piech would not be called because, a
spokesman said, 'he is not a suspect'.
An interim report on a private probe within VW, presented to the group's
supervisory board yesterday, contained 'no findings to warrant industrial
espionage accusations,' the company said in a statement last night.
Officials said after an all-day meeting of the board that Mr Piech and Mr
Lopez would not be leaving.
The investigations involving Mr Lopez and three associates, who left the
General Motors group in March, are primarily concerned with suspicions of
the systematic theft of secrets from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
The supervisory board, which appoints and oversees the work of executive
directors, was also told yesterday that group profits in 1993 could be
adversely affected by poor performances at the Seat subsidiary in Spain and
in north American and Asian-Pacific markets.
However, the German parent and the group would show a profit in the third
quarter after a DM1.6bn (Pounds 646m) loss in the first half.
The statement issued after the board session once again showed signs of a
retreat from earlier declarations that the company would break even or
return to profit this year, and that Mr Lopez would remain until he had been
found guilty.
The supervisory board also reinstated Mr Ulrich Seiffert as main board
research and development director with immediate effect. He was removed in
mid-March on the same day Mr Lopez was appointed.
The criminal investigation, under way since mid-May, shows no signs of an
early conclusion.
The VW supervisory board, which appointed auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand on
August 13 to carry out an independent probe, said yesterday it expected a
full report by the end of October.
However, KPMG will have no access to the 30 computers and quantities of
documents and diskettes seized recently by the legal authorities.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Porter pledges to fight withdrawal of LBC licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAME Shirley Porter, chairman of the London Broadcasting Company, yesterday
vowed to fight to reverse a decision to withdraw the company's two
broadcasting licences after more than 20 years.
The Radio Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio in the UK,
gave LBC's FM and AM frequencies to London News Radio.
Two new AM licences went to London Country Radio, a country music station,
and Sunrise Radio, an Asian station.
A total of 48 groups applied for eight radio licences - six of them held by
existing broadcasters.
Melody Radio, Kiss FM, the dance music station, Jazz FM and Spectrum
International Radio, the multi-ethnic station, all retained their
franchises.
Applications for business and sports radio were rejected on the grounds they
would not provide a rich mixture 24 hours a day.
LNR, chaired by Mr John Tusa, former managing director of the BBC World
Service, and bringing together many former LBC staff, is backed by Guinness
Mahon, the merchant bank, and Hachette, the French international media
group.
Dame Shirley, former leader of the Tory-controlled Westminster Council,
yesterday demanded an explanation from Lord Chalfont, Radio Authority
chairman, and launched a campaign to save the station under the slogan 'You
Can't Gag The Voice of London'.
A petition is being taken up and listeners are being invited on air to
support the campaign.
LBC which runs two radio services for the UK capital - Newstalk and Talkback
Radio - said thousands of callers ringing in to express their anger at the
decision had jammed the switchboard.
The authority appears unlikely to reverse its decision unless LBC can
demonstrate to the High Court that it had operated improperly.
Almost all of Thursday's Radio Authority meeting was taken up with LBC.
Taking away one of LBC's licences was considered and rejected because the
LNR concept - of a rolling news service and a more discursive service - was
seen as indivisable.
The key issue was programme quality and the judgment that LNR might offer
something better and more clearly differentiated.
The recent financial crisis at LBC's parent, Crown Communications, was not
seen as an issue following the injection of new money by Dame Shirely and
her family interests.
'Too loose, too light despite warnings,' said one of those involved in the
decision.
Others thought the presence of Mr Andrew Neil, as a presenter while being
editor of The Sunday Times, controversial.
LNR will take over from LBC in October 1994 for an eight year period with Mr
Peter Thornton, a former LBC editor, as editor in chief.
Losers will have another chance next year when Capital Radio's two licences
come up for renewal and two further FM frequencies for London may be
offered.

FT  04 SEP 93 / You've bought the knife, now ride the mountain bike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'Swiss Army' which immortalised the pen knife may be about to do the
same for the mountain bike.
A small business in the Jura mountains hopes to capitalise on the same
cachet with a new weapon-carrying, heavy duty bicycle it is beginning to
supply to the Swiss army.
The 'Swiss Army Bike' includes fittings for heavy machine guns, bazookas and
60mm mortar launchers, and a body paint which is invisible to someone using
infrared binoculars.
Like most things Swiss, it does not come cheap. At SFr3,280 (Pounds 1,490),
only the most devoted cyclists will want to buy one. Its weight  - 25kg -
may also count against it, as may the choice of just seven gears.
Top of the range mountain bikes weigh less than 15kg, have at least 21 gears
and cost around Pounds 1,250 - with the luxury of suspension.
The Swiss army has long been famous for its bicycle corps, a group of 5,000
amazingly fit soldiers who crank up and down the Alps with something like
100kg of kit and weapons on board.
Until now, they have accomplished these feats on a machine designed in 1905
 -pure heavy clog iron, no gears, conventional handlebars. Joining this
corps is not the soft option that recruits might have imagined.
But from next week, they will start receiving a brand new model developed at
a cost of SFr500,000 in the late 1980s by a small Swiss cycle maker, Condor,
in co-operation with the Swiss defence ministry. Condor has a SFr17m
contract to produce 5,500 new bikes for the Swiss army, but it believes
there is also a civilian market.
Mr William Affolter, Condor's chief executive, says it might be useful for
professionals, such as photographers or postmen, who have to carry heavy
loads and need a durable bike. This new version bears little resemblance to
its forebear.
Even the frame has been enlarged by two centimetres to 56cm in recognition
of the growth of the average Swiss soldier over the past 90 years.
'The saddle is the only thing that has not changed,' Mr Affolter says. It is
still a sprung type, using pure Swiss cowhide. Everything in the bike is
designed to endure heavy loads and severe weather conditions.
Although the bike is not light, it is 2kg lighter than the old one. Field
tests showed a soldier could gain about three hours on a 200km course using
the new bike.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Murdoch in talks to sell HK news group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is negotiating to sell its 50 per cent
stake in Hong Kong's leading newspaper group, the South China Morning Post,
for a price believed to be about Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m).
The move comes at the end of a hectic week for the company, during which it
unveiled wide-scale expansion plans, including a German television deal, an
'open university' in Asia and the launch of a multi-channel satellite TV
package in the UK. It also launched a broadsheet newspaper price war in the
UK by cutting the price of its flagship, The Times, by a third.
The stake in the Hong Kong paper carries a stock market value of HKDollars
4bn (Pounds 344m). Based on the current share price, Mr Murdoch should reap
a total profit of more than HKDollars 5bn, or more than 200 per cent, on his
six-year investment in the newspaper, including previous disposals.
The talks are taking place six weeks after Mr Murdoch launched his push into
pan-Asian satellite broadcasting through the purchase of 64 per cent of Hong
Kong-based Star TV.
The buyer of the South China Morning Post is believed to be a consortium led
by Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok, one of south east Asia's most powerful
businessmen. Mr Kuok owns interests in the Shangri-La hotel group and a 33
per cent stake in Hong Kong's most profitable television broadcaster TVB.
Although there has been speculation that the newspaper sale is connected
with Mr Murdoch's satellite ambitions, it is believed that he has simply
decided he does not want to face the possible political difficulties of
running a newspaper in Hong Kong when the Chinese take over in 1997.
Mr Murdoch's experience with the SCMP has been short, but extremely sweet.
He purchased the entire company in early 1987 for HKDollars 2.4bn and
subsequently stripped out a number of its publishing investments. It was
already one of the world's most profitable newspapers, but earnings have
soared since the purchase and Mr Murdoch has received around HKDollars 1.3bn
in dividend income. He raised a further HKDollars 2.3bn from the company's
flotation in 1990.
In recent months, Mr Murdoch has voiced his aim to expand into media in the
world's largest consumer market, China.
It was expected that SCMP would be the vehicle for this expansion, and the
group made an initial push into Chinese language media through the purchase
of the loss-making newspaper Wah Kiu Yat Pao. The latest announcement
therefore came as a surprise. However, it may enable him to improve his
links with the mainland by cementing a business relationship with Mr Kuok.
SCMP shares were suspended yesterday, but will resume trading on Monday. The
company advised investors to 'exercise extreme caution when dealing in
(SCMP) shares'.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Ukraine set to surrender its nuclear arsenal: Russia offers
debt deal on fleet and warheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE appeared ready yesterday to surrender its status as a nuclear power
when it agreed in principle to transfer all its nuclear warheads to Russia
for dismantling.
It is also to sell the Ukrainian share of the jointly-controlled Black Sea
fleet to Russia, which will rent the port of Sevastopol, the main Black Sea
base.
In return, Moscow will write off a substantial amount of Ukrainian debt to
Russia and supply uranium for its power stations.
The surprise agreement came at talks in the Crimea between Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. It must still be
ratified by the two countries' parliaments, where it will face opposition
from nationalist deputies, especially in Ukraine.
If implemented, the agreement will come as a relief to the US and its
allies, which have become increasingly concerned about the potential
emergence of Ukraine as a nuclear-weapon state.
Anxiety over the future of the weapons stationed in Ukraine was increased by
recent reports that the Ukrainians were trying to gain operational control
over the missiles.
The strategic arsenal on Ukrainian territory consists of 176
intercontinental ballistic missiles with a total of 1,240 warheads, and at
least 30 bombers and their nuclear armaments. It has been feared that
Ukraine might seek to retain at least the more modern of the missiles, 46
SS-24s, each carrying 10 warheads.
Ukraine's delay in ratifying the 1991 US-Soviet Start 1 arms agreement and
joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has held up implementation of
both Start 1 and the follow-up Start 2, which the US signed with Russia in
January this year.
The deal, if ratified, also removes the largest sources of enmity between
the two states - and appears to cede to Russia the senior role in a future
relationship.
The 300-ship fleet, which the two presidents had agreed to split at a summit
meeting last year, has remained a political football, as the mainly Russian
officer corps protested against the division.
Both agreements appear to have been dictated by the rapidly worsening
economic position of Ukraine, where inflation has risen to around 40 per
cent a month and all attempts at reforms have stalled.
Russia will set its payment for the Ukrainian half of the fleet - to be
worked out by a joint commission in the coming months - against an estimated
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) Ukrainian debt to Russia, mainly for oil and
gas. 'If the balance is in Ukraine's favour, then Russia will pay,' Mr
Yeltsin said after the three-hour talks.
Mr Kravchuk, speaking after the talks which were described by members of his
delegation as 'tense', said that the previously adopted decision on
splitting the fleet 'no longer corresponded to the real situation'.
If confirmed, the deal could pave the way for closer economic union between
the two states - a strategy to which Mr Kravchuk was once resolutely
hostile, but which he now appears to support under pressure from his own
industrial lobby.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Halifax plans insurance arm to take on life groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, is to set up its own insurance
company which will sell exclusively to its customers.
The move poses a challenge to the traditional life industry as well as banks
and building societies which have entered this increasingly competitive
market.
Starting in late 1994, the Halifax will sever its existing ties with
Standard Life, the UK's largest mutually owned life insurance company, for
whom it acts as exclusive sales agent. The decision represents a blow to
Standard Life, which sold 18 per cent of all its new UK business through
Halifax offices in 1992.
It is not clear whether Halifax customers will be able to buy insurance and
investment products more cheaply than they do now or whether they will earn
better investment returns.
Standard Life said yesterday that it had been paying higher commission to
Halifax agents than to any other sales agent but policies sold this way
benefited from other savings.
Industry analysts said that the process of selling policies through banks
and building societies, known as bancassurers, could offer advantages to
customers once new rules requiring sellers to disclose charges and penalties
on policies take effect next year. This is because their lower cost base
will allow them to compete on price without impairing profit margins.
Traditional insurance companies have come under attack for failing to reveal
to customers cost details and charges. The Treasury has just ruled that,
from next year, more information must be given.
'I am sure that Halifax Life will be a successful operation,' said Mr Tom
King, general manager of marketing at Standard Life.
'But I would have said there are already too many companies in the
marketplace and I don't think the marketplace is big enough to support all
the companies which are out there.'
Industry observers said the trend is likely to hasten the shakeout of small
to mid-sized insurance companies, particularly mutuals which are owned by
their policyholders and have no ready access to fresh capital for expansion.
'These retailers think they can displace existing, less efficient providers.
It's not really a matter of adding capacity,' said Mr Michael Wadsworth,
partner in the insurance practice at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co.
Mr King said the Halifax had made it clear earlier this year that it wanted
a life insurance venture of its own and the two companies discussed a joint
venture. 'But we thought it was best to use our resources to expand our
product range,' he said.
Mr Michael Blackburn, chief executive of the Halifax, said: 'We want the
flexibility that control gives you over time.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber producers may pull out

THE WORLD'S biggest rubber producing nations began a meeting here yesterday
to discuss the possibility of pulling out of the International Natural
Rubber Agreement in protest at the failure of consuming country members to
renegotiate the pact, Reuter reports from Bangkok.
Members of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries, said their
threat to quit the agreement stemmed from delay by consumers to agree on
amending its terms for shoring up chronically weak rubber prices.
The six-member ANRPC, led by Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, has tried for
two years to negotiate a new pact to replace the current six-year agreement,
which is due to lapse in December.
Producers said earlier that they would block an automatic two-year extension
of the pact at the next council meeting of the International Natural Rubber
Organisation in November persisted in impeding efforts by exporters to raise
prices.
Inro, which administers the current agreement, groups producers in ANRPC and
more than 20 consumers led by the US, the European Community and Japan.
Leading ANRPC members have said they may launch their own price support
efforts if the current United Nations-sponsored pact is not improved in
favour of producers.
Rubber prices have declined to 30-year lows in real terms.
Producers, led by Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, have been in deadlock
with consumers since March on whether to cut Inra's reference price,
currently 207.2 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram, the median point of a
range outside which market intervention is triggered.
The price must be cut by 5 per cent if the average daily Inro market
indicator price is below the group's 'may-buy' level of 175 cents in the six
months before the review.
A Thai official said producers had offered to accept a price cut at the last
Inro meeting in Kuala Lumpur in May on condition that consumers commited
themselves to working on a new agreement.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian tin industry wilts as
market slumps
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRE PREDICTIONS are being made about the future of Malaysia's tin industry
following this weeks price plunge to fresh lows this week on the Kuala
Lumpur Tin Market. Tin was trading at around MDollars 11.60 (Dollars 4.50) a
kilogram mark on the KLTM - the first time prices had dropped below the
MDollars 12 level.
'Over the last two years a record number of Malaysia's tin mines have closed
down,' said a tin trader. 'With these kind of prices it can't be long before
the whole industry collapses.'
Malaysia was once the world's biggest tin producer. But production of tin in
concentrates fell to 14,339 tonnes last year compared with 20,710 in 1991.
Traders are predicting that Malaysia's output will fall below 10,000 tonnes
this year.
The Association of Tin Producing Countries is due to meet in Kuala Lumpur at
the end of October to discuss ways to reduce global tin stockpiles and
improve prices. 'The market is really going crazy and this spells trouble
for the industry,' said Mr Redzwan Sumun, the ATPC's executive secretary.
The association groups Malaysia, Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Thailand,
Nigeria and Zaire, which together account for about 60 per cent of world tin
production. Malaysia's tin producers want the ATPC to abandon its export
quota system, saying it has done nothing to improve prices.
Non-ATPC countries such as China and Brazil are blamed for increasing their
tin exports, frustrating attempts by the association to reduce a global tin
stockpile now estimated at 40,000 tonnes. Traders say recent large sales of
tin by the US Defence Logistics Agency have also led to a market glut and
low prices.
Malaysia, a relatively high cost producer, has been particularly badly hit
by the prevailing low market prices. Foreign buyers are also reported to be
staying away from the Kuala Lumpur market because of the continued strength
of the Malaysian dollar against the US currency.

<TEXT>
Japan's silk industry organisation plans to cut production and build up
stocks to help support prices, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Nihon Kikai Seishi Kougyou Kumiai, the Japan silk manufacturers'
co-operative, decided at a directors' meeting to cut more than five working
days a month for at least three months. This will cut silk output by a total
of 4,000 bales (60kg each).
It also decided to build up 1,000 bales of stocks by the end of September
and to set up a committee to consider scrapping some production facilities.
The silk manufacturers will ask the agriculture ministry to continue selling
imported silk from its stocks while buying the same amount of domestic raw
silk in return. The operation supports raw silk futures prices as imported
silk is not deliverable on futures exchanges here.
Spot silk prices have dropped below the government-set standard silk price
of Y10,712 (Pounds 68) a kilogram since last month. When prices fall below
the standard price, the semi-official Silk Agency may buy silk to stabilise
prices.
The spot silk price in Yokohama stood at Y8,310 a kilogram on Wednesday,
against Y8,500 on Tuesday.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India tries to smooth out silk
trade problems - Chinese imports are being blamed for depressed domestic
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN silk trade, which has a powerful lobby in New Delhi, wants the
government to impose further restrictions on imports of Chinese silk, which
it blames for the depressed prices of indigenous silk that are damaging the
livelihoods of nearly 1m growers.
Exporters of silk goods, who mostly use the Chinese silk yarn because of its
superior quality, have warned, however, that exports will fall sharply if
any more restrictions are placed on the import of raw silk.
At present only the exporters are allowed to import silk yarn, on condition
that they add 150 per cent to its value value in producing goods for export.
Last year, India exported silk goods worth Rs7.34bn (Pounds 155m).
To placate the growers the federal government has reintroduced the
pre-inspection of export shipments of silk goods to ensure that the imported
yarn has been properly used. There may have been some diversion of imported
silk into the market during the one year period when there was no
pre-inspection, admits Mr S. Shah, spokesman for the Silk Association of
India. 'But this certainly did not call for checking silk export cargoes.
'The system breeds corruption. The inspectors' prime concern is to collect
money from the exporters (rather) than to ensure that the goods are in
order.'
India is the second largest producer of silk after China. But the domestic
demand, particularly in the form of women's sarees, is so strong that only
about 15 per cent of the indigenous silk production of about 13,000 tonnes
is available for weaving silk fabrics and carpets for export. Moreover, as
Mr PSS Thomas, secretary of the Central Silk Board, admits, Indian silk yarn
is not strong enough for use in high speed weaving machines.
India must depend on imported yarn for the production of high-value,
flawless silk for the export market. Nevertheless, there is an overseas
market for silk fabrics produced by hand loom units using Indian raw
material.
India officially imports nearly 3,000 tonnes of silk from China. 'There is
very little evidence that the Chinese silk is also smuggled into India,'
says Mr Thomas. The incentive to smuggle in Chinese silk remains, however,
as it is at least 30 per cent cheaper than the Indian silk. Some imports
also come from South Korea.
The Central Silk Board, says Mr Thomas, favours the discontinuance of the
import of ungraded Chinese silk.
China, with a production of over 55,000 tonnes, controls 90 per cent of the
world trade in silk. But, more than the imports from China, it is the
continuous increase in domestic production since 1986-87 that has depressed
Indian silk prices. Even so, Indian prices remain the highest in the world.
Mr Thomas says the farmers will have to seek better returns by way of
productivity improvement. India produces less than 40kg of raw silk per
hectare (2.471 acres), compared with 80kg in China and 120kg in Japan.
The twin problems of low productivity and inferior quality are being tackled
through the World Bank and Swiss Development Corporation funded Rs5.5bn
National Sericulture Project. The seven-year project, now in its fifth year,
is bringing about an improvement in silk growing practices by making
available to the farmers high-yielding mulberry saplings (on which silk
works feed), quality silk worm eggs and scientific methods of silk worm
rearing.
The project is designed to strengthen the sericulture infrastructure in the
traditional silk growing states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,
West Bengal and Jammu &amp; Kashmir and promote silk growing in 12 other states.
Mr Thomas says that it has already resulted in an additional 64,000 hectares
of land being brought under mulberry cultivation, beating the target of
56,000 hectares. The project will raise silk production by 6,000 tonnes and
create employment for another 1m people.
Under another sericulture programme funded by Japan, attempts are being made
to develop bivoltine, a superior quality of silk worm, for the Indian
tropical climate. And a breakthrough is confidently expected.
India is also hoping for getting technical know-how from China in the near
future. Mr Thomas thinks it will facilitate the production of 'a good
quantity of high quality silk in India if private corporations are involved
in sericulture'. The corporations can get into the business either by
acquiring land or by entering into some kind of arrangement with the
farmers. Among the more important Indian business houses, which are looking
into sericulture seriously are the Kirloskars, the Thapars, RPG Enterprises
and SPIC, Mr Thomas says.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computers spark price plunge
for gold and silver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD AND silver prices plunged in late trading yesterday as the computers
programmed by some New York investment funds sent out 'sell' signals. Silver
led the way and lost nearly 10 per cent of its value in a few minutes of
hectic activity and touched Dollars 4.35 a troy ounce before closing in
London at Dollars 4.49, down 32 cents.
This provided a catalyst for the funds to start selling gold - many of them
link their computerised precious metals investment programmes. The gold
price at the London bullion market touched Dollars 361.50 an ounce at one
point before recovering to close at Dollars 364.50, down Dollars 5.25.
Only one month ago, on August 2, gold reached Dollars 406.70 an ounce, its
highest level since the outbreak of the Gulf war in January 1991. 'The froth
in the market is being blown away,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the
Union Bank of Switzerland.
He pointed out that some New York investors were squaring their market
positions ahead of the long Labour Day weekend (the Labour Day holiday in
the US is on September 6).
Physical demand for gold in the Far East and the Middle East remained weak
and the market might even be over-supplied at present. The best hope for the
gold bulls was that there would be a seasonal pick-up in demand for physical
gold so that the market would be stabilised.
Mr Smith was sticking to his forecast, first made in July, that gold would
average Dollars 350 an ounce in the last three months of 1993.
Mr James Leahy, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, suggested a range of
between Dollars 375 and Dollars 380 an ounce was more likely in the last
part of this year, with the price perhaps ending 1993 at about Dollars 400.
He pointed out that yesterday's sell-off took place in a seasonally very
quiet market when 'a little selling goes a long way'.
However, if gold's closing price on the New York Commodity Exchange today
was below Dollars 365, 'it would be worrying for gold bulls'. If gold was
above that level, 'all is not lost'.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wheat crop forecast
raised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Forecasters consultancy has raised its forecast for the
Australian wheat crop to 15m tonnes for the year ending March 31 1994, up
from last month's prediction of 14.9m tonnes but still below last year's
actual crop of 15.33m tonnes.
AWF put the area sown to wheat at 9.75m hectares in 1993/94 compared with
last month's forecast of 9.9m and 9.07m last year.
It said the development of the Western Australian wheat crop had been the
most significant event over the past month, with regular rain and early
sowing suggesting that the state should produce wheats of higher than
average protein levels.

A TEAM of senior Pakistani agricultural officials, accompanied by UN
specialists, visited the city of Rahim Yar Khan in Southern Punjab this
week, amid growing concerns over a potential locust attack.
The large cotton crop is considered to be faced with the greatest risk,
followed by sugar-cane, senior officials say.
The sense of urgency has pushed both India and Pakistan - South Asia's two
main rivals - to co-operate in launching a large-scale locust emergency
operation on both sides of their borders in Punjab and along the Pakistani
province of Sindh.
Plant protection officials from the two sides are reported to have
maintained daily radio contact during the past week.
Mr Zahid Saeed, Pakistan's acting foreign secretary said earlier this week
in response to questions on Indo-Pakistani co-operation: 'This is a common
problem, we'll have to face it together close to border areas.
'Locusts don't need passports or visas to travel.'
'They can ruin crops on either side of the border,' added a senior Western
diplomat in Islamabad.
Some senior officials say that military commanders from both countries have
also been in touch, to avoid fire on spraying aircrafts and helicopters.
'We have to avoid any accidents because as you know, there are troops on
both sides,' one official said.
Some officials say that they are pressed for time and money. The next week
is considered to be the crucial period for stepping up spraying operations,
before the locusts start flying to areas with large crop lands.
The spraying operations on the Pakistani side are estimated to cost Dollars
1.3m. So far, only Dollars 300,000 dollars has been committed in aid by
bilateral donors and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.

stake in Tofas, the local Fiat subsidiary, in what would be the largest
international listing of a leading Turkish company, writes John Murray Brown
in Ankara.
The banks were yesterday in negotiations in Ankara with the Public
Participation Administration (PPA), the government agency handling state
sales to the public. A decision on the sale is expected shortly.
The PPA is considering plans for either a share listing on the New York
Stock Exchange or a direct placement to US institutions.
The issue would be worth Dollars 600m at current prices, and would give a
buyer a stake in Turkey's largest car business. The government hopes to
conclude the deal this year.

PROCORDIA is to change its name to Pharmacia after the Swedish group splits
into separate pharmaceutical and consumer products units later this year,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
Mr Jan Ekberg, head of Procordia, will be Pharmacia's chief executive.
Procordia is being split following an agreement in June between its two main
owners, the Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck maker. Volvo
will gain a 74 per cent stake in the group's consumer products operations,
and a 25 per cent holding in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses
to be grouped within Pharmacia.
The government will be the majority owner in Pharmacia, although it is
likely to sell its stake next year. Pharmacia includes 51 per cent of
Erbamont, the Italian drugs company which Procordia bought from Montedison
in May.

The group, one of Luxembourg's biggest banks, said it had benefited from a
strong increase in interest, commission and trading income. Its balance
sheet at June 30 totalled LFr688bn, up 6.2 per cent on the end of last year.
Banque Generale customer deposits were also up LFr53.5bn to LFr493bn at June
30, a rise of nearly 11 per cent.
The company said the economic slowdown had led to increased use of existing
credit lines and advances by private and corporate customers, but new loan
applications had dropped.

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Turkey-Libya oil-for-debt swap

<TEXT>
TURKEY and Libya have agreed an oil-for-debts swap to settle the Dollars
600m owed to Turkish contractors. The deal, signed after joint talks in
Ankara, ends more than three years of negotiations on Libyan payment
defaults to 35 Turkish companies.
The debts relate to business won in the early 1980s when Turkish contractors
concluded deals worth around Dollars 10bn building infrastructure for the
Libyan oil industry.
The oil-for-debts accord envisages delivery of 30,000 barrels a day, which
at current prices would settle the Dollars 200m of debts agreed with the
Libyan Treasury, in around 12 months. An additional Dollars 250m is owed to
companies, but not yet agreed with the Libyans. Turkish companies will also
receive 40 per cent of the project value in local Libyan currency.
Mr Barlas Turan, head of the contractors' union, said it would be a boost to
Libyan trade where Turkish contractors still have around Dollars 1.5bn of
continuing business. There was an undertaking to consider increasing the
shipments after 12 months.
The oil will be delivered to Tupras, Turkey's state-owned refinery at Izmit.

REBEL leaders in western Georgia yesterday called on ousted president Zviad
Gamsakhurdia to return from exile, saying they would fight to restore him to
power, Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
The 60-strong rebel parliament voted to bring the exiled leader back to his
home region of Mingrelia in western Georgia. Armed supporters, controlling
much of the region, say they are strong enough to put him back in power.
Earlier yesterday Georgian media relayed a government statement which said
Mr Gamsakhurdia had told his supporters, partially surrounding the Black Sea
port of Poti, to blockade the town.
But the exiled leader, living in the Chechen capital Grozny since early 1992
after being ousted from power in Georgia, denied he had ordered the blockade
in preparation for his return, Itar-Tass news agency said.
He told Tass that the railway lines from Poti to Tbilisi had been blockaded
by Mkhedrioni pro-government forces.
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze flew to Poti yesterday and then to the
towns of Samtredia and Kutaisi.
The government says it is ready to send in troops against the rebels, who
have seized a chunk of western Georgia.

FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aero-engines and industrial power group Rolls-Royce recorded one of the
day's sharpest falls in percentage terms after it surprised the market with
a rights issue and reported figures just below market forecasts.
Half-time profits came in at Pounds 31m, against estimates of around the
Pounds 35m mark, and were accompanied by an announcement of a one-for-four
rights issue at 130p, to raise Pounds 307m.
Market watchers were unconvinced by the company's reasons for the cash call,
pointing out that it would dilute 'the earnings recovery picture'. One
researcher said: 'They have simply failed to explain the reasons for the
rights issue now. It is opportunistic.' Analysts were also alarmed by the
continued R&amp;D expenditure, leading some to suggest that there may be
problems with the Trent engine programme.
Dealers rushed to sell the shares, which tumbled 11 to 152 1/2 p in heavy
trading of 14m as brokers moved to downgrade full year profits forecasts.
NatWest Securities weighed in with a sharp downgrade, reducing its full year
estimate by Pounds 17m to Pounds 73m, while Charterhouse Tilney moved from
Pounds 85m to Pounds 68m.
London Scottish Bank, the financial services, consumer credit, debt
collection and reinsurance group, attracted a wave of takeover speculation
that drove the shares up to a record 105 1/2 p before closing at 104p,
leaving a net gain of 15. Turnover was a much higher than usual 296,000
shares. Provident Financial, 4 easier at 448p, was one name put forward as a
potential bidder for the group.
There was a further fresh burst of buying interest in the life assurance
sector, where Refuge Group, which holds a 14.9 per cent stake in London
Scottish, rose 13 to 1028p. Britannic added 8 at 478p and United Friendly
extended its recent strong performance to close 30 higher at 688p.
Sun Alliance's poor performance affected other composites, General Accident
weakening 16 to 657p, Commercial Union 10 to 593p and Guardian Royal
Exchange 7 to 210p. Traders reported big two-way trading in Royal Insurance,
2 off at 309p on turnover of 5m.
Renewed switching oper-ations out of HSBC and into Standard Chartered drove
the former down 9 1/2 more to 717p and sustained the latter, which edged up
3 to 941p.
Talk that Next will shortly be expanding into the US, albeit in only a small
number of outlets, depressed the shares. They finished 7 1/2 cheaper at
193p.
Reports of a downgrade by a US broker on Xerox Corp in the US impacted on
Rank Organisation shares, which retreated 22 to 763p.
A deal between Chrysalis and Fujisankei in which the latter will buy a share
in Chrysalis's fledgling record label for Dollars 17.5m sent the stock
surging 37 to 116p.
Suggestions that next month's figures from Lucas Industries will be
accompanied by an enhanced scrip dividend alternative boosted the shares,
which ended 4 ahead at 163p.

FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurer disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst individual performance from any of the FT-SE 100 stocks came from
Sun Alliance, the composite insurance company, which closed 20, or 5.2 per
cent, down at 367p, having touched 361p at one point, after the group
announced a disappointing net asset value figure for the half year along
with its interim results.
Sun Alliance shares approached their all-time high of 398p, reached in March
1991, last week, shrugging aside recent market rumours that the insurer's
interims could be accompanied by a sizeable rights issue.
However, dealers said the slide in the share price was not accompanied by
any great volume of selling pressure. Turnover in Sun Alliance was 3.1m.
The company's profits figures were above most market expectations, but
dealers expressed concern about the reduction in the group's solvency ratio,
from 54 per cent to 50 per cent. The proposed Pounds 300m preference share
issue 'removes the threat of a big cash call on shareholders', said an
analyst.

FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, were well received in
spite of being at the bottom end of market forecasts and the shares advanced
8 to 210p in very heavy turnover of 23m. A leisure specialist described the
interims as a 'fresh start' for the group, which saw senior management
changes following the retirement of Mr Cyril Stein as chairman.
There were signs of such a change late yesterday as two previously negative
houses were preparing to turn buyers of the stock. Analysts said the new
management's willingness to reconsider the group's dividend payment - some
in the market are forecasting a cut for the finals - was taken as a positive
sign. And the need for fresh capital through disposals or a rights issue was
also said to be on the management's agenda. Brokers' profits forecasts for
the finals came down to a range of Pounds 140m to Pounds 155m.
The group's Texas DIY chain was the worst performer and dragged down most
other DIY-related stocks. Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, fell 12 to 666p. Do It
All owners Boots and WH Smith lost 5 to 485p and a penny to 463p
respectively. By contrast, MFI gained 3 at 146p in very busy trade of 12m as
dealers reported a big buyer in the market.
A good performance from Ladbroke's hotel division helped Forte climb 8 to
244p.
Interim figures at the top end of expectations and an enhanced scrip
dividend alternative triggered a flurry of buying in Burmah Castrol, which
raced to an all-time high of 820p. The shares came off the top later in the
session to close a net 15 up at 813p.
Regarding the enhanced scrip dividend alternative, one of the oil sector's
leading analysts said: 'This is a clever and positive development and offers
a solution to the company's unrelieved ACT problems. It enhances earnings
per share.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs sector in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS FROM the US that the Clinton administration's health care reforms
will not impose mandatory price increases on prescription drugs sent
pharmaceutical shares in London sharply forward in hefty turnover.
Speculation over the US health care issue has dogged pharmaceutical stocks
on both sides of the Atlantic for several months now, and investors, taking
their cue from yesterday's report, cast off their doubts and went on a
buying spree. By the London close, Zeneca had surged 33 to 760p with 8.7m
traded, Glaxo was up 22 at 636p on turnover of 13m, and Wellcome had climbed
26 to 755p with 3.9m dealt. SmithKline Beecham added 20 at 457p.
However, health care analysts were somewhat cautious. Dr Jonathan Gelles at
US broker Wertheim Schroder warned: 'Investors are running away with the
idea that no mandatory price increases will lead to higher profits for the
industry. However, the fundamental problems of the industry remain and drugs
companies will continue to incur below par operating profits for some years
to come. We continue to be selective in our recommendations.'
Other specialists said that in spite of the press reports they believed that
the Clinton reforms would include voluntary price restraints which would
have much the same effect as mandatory ones.
Meanwhile, fears that President Clinton will turn to the tobacco and drinks
industry in order to help fund his reforms knocked several related stocks in
the London market. Among these, Allied-Lyons tumbled 16 to 610p, Grand
Metropolitan 10 to 445p, Rothmans 19 to 697p and Guinness 16 to 493p.
Dealers said Guinness was also affected by a French press report suggesting
that the group was considering increasing its holding in LVMH, the luxury
goods group, to 35 per cent. The two companies already have a 24.6 per cent
cross-shareholding.

FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Selling pressure in equities
increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM clouds were gathering over the London stock market yesterday and US
support for the drug stocks finally proved unable to counterbalance downward
pressures across the wider range of equities. Weakness in UK government
bonds, another round of unsettling company trading statements, and the first
of the feared rights issues, combined to fuel profit-taking selling
pressure.
Traders were divided between those who hoped that the easier trends of the
past two sessions were only to be expected in view of the close tonight of
the extended three week equity trading account, and those who believe that
the market may face a more fundamental correction. However, the big
investment institutions remained unwilling to sell stocks and confidence in
year-end predictions remained sound.
The setback was the more significant in view of strong gains in the
international drug stocks which were heavily bought from across the Atlantic
at first on reports from Washington that President Clinton has dropped the
idea of short term price controls on the healthcare industry . The sector
led the London market ahead to a gain of 8.9 in early trading but buying
support was soon lacking.
Losses in UK bonds, finally extending to around half a point in the longer
dates, cut into equity gains. The market took a further tumble when a slow
start on Wall Street appeared to leave London without the US support that
has been significant in recent sessions.
The final reading on the FT-SE Index showed a fall of 12.5 to 3,072.6, just
above the day's low. But gains in the drug sector, notably Glaxo, SmithKline
Beecham, Wellcome and Zeneca, were worth plus nine points on the Footsie,
indicating the depth of underlying weakness in the domestic stocks.
This raised concerns about predictions in the market that a shakeout was
likely in the near term. Confidence sounded uncertain last night as market
traders watched the bond market and the company reporting list with some
degree of apprehension.
The Pounds 307m rights issue call from Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group,
was slightly smaller than feared, while a maintained dividend at Ladbroke,
the leisure group, was welcomed. However, worries over impending company
results came into sharper focus in late dealings when Bowater fell sharply
despite good profits news after upsetting the stock market with a cautious
interim statement.
The reaction to the Bowater statement appeared to underline the current
nervousness on the company front, which in turn reflects its need for
confirmation of recovery in the domestic economy.
Once again, trading volume increased as the Footsie fell away, and the final
total of 674.3m shares traded through Seaq compared with 612.2m on the
previous day. More significantly, retail, or customer business rose to
Pounds 1.45bn on Wednesday when the equity market began to turn lower.
The UK corporate reporting diary is light today but equity strategists will
scan the domestic money supply data for signs of further recovery in the UK
economy, and the leading US economic indicators for similar evidence from
across the Atlantic.

<TEXT>
EARLY strength in stock index futures that was underpinned by heavy demand
for drug issues faded as dealers turned to focus on the weakening gilts
sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened in line with the previous day's close at 3,093, the September
contract on the FT-SE 100 moved steadily forward, with the market as a whole
supported by the demand in the pharmaceuticals. The session's high of 3,102
was reached around 9.30am, after which the contract drifted gently lower.
The downward direction gathered pace as the mood in UK bonds turned
negative, as did that in short sterling.
Further weakness in the afternoon saw September ease to the day's low of
3,081 before steadying to finish at 3,086.
A significant amount of basket trading was reported, most of it early in the
session, and for most of the time the contract traded in a range of 3,085 to
3,095. Volume at the close was 8,496 contracts in September and 1,641 lots
in the December contract.
A large single deal in the Euro FT-SE 100 in the traded options, together
with heavy dealings in Glaxo options, boosted total turnover to 38,684 lots,
against a previous 21,661. Volume in the Euro FT-SE contract was 9,565 lots
and that in the FT-SE 100 option 9,409. Among stock options, strong demand
in the pharmaceuticals saw 6,260 contracts dealt in Glaxo.

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Healthcare issues rise as Dow
declines again

Wall Street
IN SPITE of heavy demand for health-related issues, blue chips mainly
weakened in subdued trading yesterday as more investors deserted the equity
markets ahead of the long US holiday weekend, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19 points at
3,626.10. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.85 easier at 461.30.
Secondary stocks fared better, with the American SE composite gaining 2.31
at 461.28 and the Nasdaq composite adding 2.50 at 748.65, both record highs.
Trading volume on the New York SE was 259.9m shares.
Once again, the markets struggled to find a clear direction, in spite of
another big gain in bond prices. Normally, rising bond prices (which sent
long yields down to new record lows) would provide sustenance for stocks;
but so many market participants were on holiday ahead of the Labor Day
weekend that the bond rally had little impact.
Economic news also left traders and investors unmoved: jobless claims fell
7,000 in the final full week of August, while factory orders were down a
larger than expected 2.1 per cent in July. Little attention was paid to the
data because the market was speculating instead on what might be revealed in
today's August employment report. Wall Street economists are forecasting
that non-farm payrolls rose about 150,000 last month.
In afternoon trading, sell programs, concentrated mostly in blue chips, hit
the market.
The brightest feature of the day was the drug and healthcare sector, which
rose sharply on a newspaper report that President Bill Clinton had abandoned
his plan to impose mandatory price controls on drug companies and health
service providers as part of his reform of health care.
Among leading issues, Merck advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 ,
Pfizer Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 , Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 57, Schering-Plough Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 63 and Glaxo Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 . In the healthcare group, United HealthCare forged
ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 62 1/8 and US Healthcare, traded on the Nasdaq
market, rose Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 .
The gains in drug issues were offset by declines in cyclicals. Aluminum
Company of America fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 73, Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 107 7/8 , Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 80 3/4 and International Paper Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 62 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO slipped moderately from its record high as gold shares weighed down
the overall market.
The TSE 300 index ended 6.6 off at 4,137.1 and declines led rises by 375 to
367. Volume rose to 60.3m shares valued at CDollars 709.7m. The golds index
dropped 2.9 per cent as the New York bullion price fell USDollars 6.50 an
ounce to USDollars 363.75.

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Drug stocks provide measure of
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN pharmaceutical stocks were given a boost by reports from the US
that price controls on drug products were to be postponed, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT recovered slightly after an early tumble on the weaker US dollar.
It got some lift from Volkswagen, and the big three chemical stocks as the
DAX index rose 7.04 to 1,925.62. Turnover eased from DM8.5bn to DM7.9bn.
VW denied rumours that its management board chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech,
and its embattled production chief, Mr Ignacio Lopez, would be replaced at
today's supervisory board meeting. However, the shares rose DM11.90 to
DM379.50 and held on to their gains in the post bourse.
BASF, Bayer and Hoechst rose by DM3.10 to DM258, DM7.40 to DM307 and DM3.40
to DM278.50 respectively, turnover in Bayer rising from DM305m to DM489m in
the process. Mr Charles Brown at Goldman Sachs said that the sector had been
soft earlier in the week, but that the shares were cheaper than those of,
say, ICI in the UK. He added that Bayer had started on its cost production
programme earlier than BASF or Hoechst, its earnings are less volatile, and
it is on a 1993 p/e of only 14 compared with 33 for ICI.
PARIS continued to drift lower, the CAC-40 index closing down 6.81 at 2,185.
Elf Aquitaine remained on investors' minds, the shares down another FFr7.70
at FFr428.00. Since the oil group's interims were released on Tuesday the
shares have fallen by 4.6 per cent.
James Capel in London has downgraded the stock to hold, although the broker
notes that, excluding the one-off write down in its North Sea oil and gas
reserves, 'the operating results were broadly in line with expectations
 .and the share price is now reflecting expectations of earnings recovery in
1994 and 1995'.
Reports that the US would postpone a decision to impose price controls on
pharmaceutical stocks lifted Elf Sanofi, which went against the market trend
with a rise of FFr18 to FFr1,014.
Rhone-Poulenc fell back FFr3.50 to FFr158 on slightly disappointing results,
while Axa went the other way, up FFr20 to FFr1,630 after a jump in first
half turnover.
AMSTERDAM saw a sharp fall in VNU, the publishing group, on disappointment
over interim figures, the shares losing Fl 5.90 or 4 per cent to Fl 135.50.
The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.6 at 129.5.
The fall in VNU hit the publishing sector, with Elsevier declining Fl 1.70
to Fl 145.10 and Wolters Kluwer down Fl 1.00 at Fl 102.10.
ING was one of the few stocks to show a rise on the day after satisfactory
interims, the shares ending 70 cents higher at Fl 73.80. Meanwhile, Heineken
dropped Fl 2.00 to Fl 185.60 in reaction to its half year figures.
ZURICH's chemicals gained on a Washington Post report that President Bill
Clinton had dropped the idea of imposing short-term price controls in the US
health industry. Roche certificates were the most active stock as they rose
SFr40 to SFr5,115, and Sandoz certificates added SFr40 to SFr3,270.
However, there was profit-taking in banks where SBC bearers fell SFr13 to
SFr473 after good results. Overall, the SMI index lost 6.6 at 2,463.8.
MADRID's fears of an accelerating downtrend after Wednesday's 2.6 per cent
fall turned out to be groundless as the general index closed 1.22 higher at
296.31, reflecting cuts in Spanish bond yields.
Volume eased to an estimated Pta27.5bn, from Pta32bn.
STOCKHOLM was driven higher by the performance of Astra, which gained in
line with other European pharmaceutical stocks. It rose SKr14 to SKr172 as
the sector sub-index advanced nearly 6 per cent.
The Affarsvarlden general index put on 11.80 to 1,273.90 in turnover of
SKr2bn.
HELSINKI fell sharply, the Hex index losing 40.61 or almost 3 per cent at
1,375.37, as a weaker currency and worries over impending wage talks weighed
on sentiment - there are suggestions that employees may demand wage
increases, after two years of pay freezes. The banking and financial
sub-index dropped by 5 per cent.
MILAN saw activity in a few major issues, although the overall tone of the
market was quiet. The Comit index closed down 4.79 at 620.88.
Rumours of possible stake building in Ferruzzi helped to lift the shares
L27.50 to to L307.50, while strong buying was noted in Olivetti, up L111 at
L1,966 and Pirelli, up L96 at L1,966. WARSAW rebounded from a two-day slump,
the WIG index climbing by 585.9 or 9.3 per cent to 6,893.8 as 18 out of 19
stocks rose by their 10 per cent daily limits in turnover of 728bn zlotys.

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Further hopes for Oslo after a recovery
in 1993 - Karen Fossli on prospects for Norwegian equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a recent market setback, several domestic and foreign analysts
believe that Oslo equities have some way to go before they become fully
priced.
They say that the fundamentals augur well for Oslo. Interest rates are low,
the economy is strong, oil prices and the dollar are relatively firm at high
levels and corporate earnings are growing.
Even the dark shadow cast over the market by Norway's six-year bank crisis
has been blown away by strong first-half results from the sector; there are
some signs that confidence in the banks is being restored.
Rebounding strongly from a dismal performance during 1991 and 1992, Oslo's
all-share index has surged ahead by 52 per cent this year to become one of
Europe's top performers; last year it was among the worst in the world, with
the all-share down 10 per cent.
The driving force has been the sharp decline in domestic interest rates,
which have plunged this year to their lowest level in more than a decade.
One-month money market rates are currently hovering around 6.5 per cent,
while the 12-month rate has been relatively stable at around 6.1 per cent.
Analysts believe that interest rates have yet to bottom out. They could fall
to between 5.5 to 5.7 per cent this year, and support a further rise in the
market of between 10 and 18 per cent before the turn of the year.
However, since attaining a year's high of 591.08 on August 13 in record
turnover of NKr1.44bn, the market has relinquished some 4 1/2 per cent.
Analysts say that the decline should be viewed as a short-term technical
correction, rather than as an indication of how Oslo may perform during the
remainder of the year. 'Oslo could go up by another 10 per cent,' forecasts
Mr Tage Haug, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
Mr Haug notes that there has been a distinct lack of share issues in 1993;
but he sees activity picking up during the second half, due to excess
liquidity in the market arising from low interest rates and helped by the
strong performance of share prices already this year.
According to Mr Kjell Skjevesland, director of the Oslo-based Norse
Securities, last week's retreat in Norwegian equities was due mainly to
disappointment over the Bundesbank's refusal to cut interest rates.
He believes that the market could advance by 15 per cent before next year
and estimates that foreign investors have been behind about 60 per cent of
Oslo's trading volume.
Other positive factors behind the bourse's upbeat performance include the
strong dollar - currently at a near four-year high of NKr7.30 - and stable
oil prices, hovering around Dollars 17 a barrel, which are nothing but good
news for Norway's oil-dependent economy.
The US-based investment house Merrill Lynch believes that the dollar will
rise by 13 per cent against European currencies over the next 12 months and
that oil prices will strengthen over the same period.
Good earnings momentum in corporate blue chips, together with the strength
of the Norwegian economy, is also expected to enhance market sentiment.
Merrill Lynch expects earnings growth of 130 per cent in 1993 and 180 per
cent in 1994 - after an 89 per cent drop last year from the 1989 peak.
Norway's annual rate of inflation, at 2.3 per cent, is currently among the
lowest in Europe, and the country's lowest in three decades. The Bank of
Norway expects the economy to expand by 1.2 per cent in 1993 and 2.3 per
cent in 1994. Again, this is among the strongest projected growth rates in
Europe.
In relation to European markets, Oslo will stand up quite well and will
continue to be one of the best performers. Most European markets have
reached earlier peaks but Oslo could go another 15 to 20 per cent,' believes
Mr Klas Andersson of Goldman Sachs.

SHARE prices closed marginally higher after fluctuating in a narrow range on
arbitrage buying and profit-taking by institutional investors, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 29.90 at 20,983.20 after a day's high of 21,045.90
and low of 20,921.29. Foreign investors, individuals and dealers supported
the index against profit-taking by investment trusts and life insurers.
Volume was 350m shares, against 365m, remaining above 300m shares for the
third consecutive day. Advances led declines by 540 to 470, with 173 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 4.57 up at
1,693.09, a new high for this year. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
1.56 firmer at 1,298.22.
Hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate continued to support
sentiment, in spite of comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the
Bank of Japan, ruling out an early rate reduction. Many investors expect the
Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy next week, when the tankan, its
quarterly report on business sentiment, is due to be released.
Retail shares gained ground on reports that Mr Isao Nakauchi, chairman of
the supermarket chain Daiei, had presented Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime
minister, with a report on the deregulation of the retail sector. Daiei rose
Y110 to Y1,340, while Ito-Yokado gained Y210 at Y5,040 and Seiyu Y50 at
Y1,470.
The fall in the yen supported some consumer electronics makers. Matsushita
Electric Industrial moved ahead Y50 to Y1,480, TDK Y80 to Y3,990 and Victor
Y30 to Y1,050.
Yamaichi Securities lost Y10 to Y843 on rumours of undisclosed tobashi
deals, where brokers shift clients' accounts to hide unrealised profits.
Nomura Securities shed Y30 to Y2,170 but Daiwa Securities rose Y10 to
Y1,480.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 79.91 at 22,959.99 in volume of 80.3m
shares. Roundup
ANOTHER clutch of record highs enlivened trading in the region yesterday.
Pakistan was closed due to a strike at the exchange.
MANILA reached another all-time peak, led again by strength in Philippine
Long Distance Telephone, up 35 pesos at 1,305 pesos. The composite index
added 15.52 at 1,842.72 as turnover slipped from 789m pesos to 624m.
Foreign investors were active buyers of 'B' shares in Manila Electric, up 5
pesos at 241 pesos, and San Miguel, 10 higher at 143 pesos.
SINGAPORE built on Wednesday's gains, the Straits Times Industrial index
adding 9.09 at 2,021.87, for its second consecutive record high.
Brokers said US buying was supporting the market, while second line stocks
again featured heavily in trading.
KUALA LUMPUR also set a new high on institutional buying of blue chips. The
composite index finished 30.12, or 3.7 per cent, up at 851.16.
The market's rise was led by Genting, up MDollars 1.90 at MDollars 25, while
Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia saw respective gains of MDollars 1 and
70 cents to MDollars 11.80 and MDollars 17.70.
NEW ZEALAND, helped by a 12-cent advance in Telecom to NZDollars 3.94,
closed above the 2,000 index level for the first time in two weeks. The
NZSE-40 capital index rose 32.42, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,016.45 in turnover
of NZDollars 45m.
HONG KONG retreated further as profit-taking took hold, and the Hang Seng
index fell 48.74 to 7,493.45 in turnover of some HKDollars 3.2bn.
The banking sector continued to weaken, with HSBC Holdings down 50 cents at
HKDollars 83, but above the day's low of HKDollars 82.
The utilities sector was weaker after recent gains, with Hong Kong Telecom
losing 20 cents to HKDollars 12.40, China Light 50 cents to HKDollars 43 and
HK Electric 10 cents to HKDollars 20.50.
SEOUL was modestly higher, with interest mainly concentrated on small and
medium-sized companies. The composite index added 3.17 at 678.03 in turnover
of Won284bn.
AUSTRALIA fell back from early highs on some profit-taking in News Corp,
which saw an intraday peak of ADollars 10.38 after the group announced new
satellite ventures, before closing a net 20 cents down at ADollars 9.80. The
All Ordinaries index finished 8.7 off at 1,968.4 in turnover of ADollars
544.7m.
Among other major issues, BHP fell 14 cents to ADollars 15.98 and National
Australia Bank 20 cents to ADollars 11.54

FT  03 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Belgian futures crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN interest rate futures contracts crashed yesterday after the
country's central bank surprised dealers by raising all of its major
short-term interest rates to defend its currency, writes James Blitz.
The Belgian authorities yesterday lifted their emergency rate from 13 per
cent to 14 per cent and their discount rate from 6 per cent to 7 per cent.
Although dealers had anticipated a slow policy of rate cutting, few had
expected an immediate rise in the country's interest rates.
The impact was felt sharply in the September Belgian franc contract, which
dropped 156 basis points to finish at 87.80 as dealers revised their
expectations.
The December contract was down 80 basis points at a closing 91.70. However,
over-night rates in the cash market responded more modestly, peaking at 15
per cent.
The Belgian interest rate futures market is small, but yesterday's events
rebounded on France, where dealers wondered whether the author-ities would
also adopt a very tight policy on rates.
The Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at its regular
Thursday inter-vention. But with the French franc coming under pressure
against the D-Mark on currency markets, dealers wondered whether the
authorities had missed the chance to ease policy. The September contract was
down 10 basis points at 92.74.
In the sterling cash market, there was deep dismay among some dealers about
the volatility in the overnight rate in recent days.
Yesterday, a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn was mostly removed in the early round
of trading, with banks selling a repo worth Pounds 1.7bn. The overnight rate
therefore tumbled from 7 per cent to 2 per cent in the morning. Three-month
cash eased to 5 7/8 per cent.
This was an extraordinary contrast with Wednesday's events, when most of a
Pounds 1.7bn shortage was not removed and the overnight rate touched 8 per
cent.
Two bank dealers regarded this as one of the most stark examples yet of how
sterling cash markets are dominated by one or two clearing banks for the
purposes of their own liquidity management. 'All the discount houses
together could not remove a shortage like today's,' said one discount house
dealer. 'It makes a mockery of London as a financial centre.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark rampant in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark performed power-fully against most currencies yesterday, sending
the dollar down to a new low and pushing currencies in Europe's exchange
rate mechanism to new levels of divergence, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, the D-Mark has moved up across the board, partly because of
a perception that central banks need to buy the currency to help balance
their reserves after the Bundesbank's ERM intervention last month.
New worries about the strength of the US economy have also forced the dollar
down below the 1992 peak for the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate.
When European trading opened yesterday, the D-Mark was already performing
strongly against the Japanese yen, starting an assault on the currency that
was to take it from Y63.64 to Y64.24 at the close.
Belgium's decision to raise its short-term interest rates by a full
percentage point later triggered a new attack on European currencies.
Several dealers said Belgium's tight monetary policy in support of its
currency was literally incredible, coming on a day when it reported a rise
in unemployment from July's 13.5 per cent to 14.1 per cent in August.
The Belgian franc dropped from a close on Wednesday night of BFr21.49
against the D-Mark to a low of BFr21.55. It later rallied to end at
BFr21.49. The Belgian authorities intervened to support the currency, saying
they had spent BFr3bn. A London dealer said his own dealing room has seen
three times that much.
Mr Mark Austin, currency strategist at Midland Global Markets, said
Belgium's attempts to peg the Belgian franc to the D-Mark were folly and
could exacerbate the downward pressure on the currency in the near term.
'Belgium could be doing a Sweden,' he added, recalling the large devaluation
of the Swedish krona last year after the country pushed short-term rates up
to very high levels.
Yesterday's events triggered a sharp depreciation in most European
currencies against the D-Mark. The French franc dropped from FFr3.507 to
close at FFr3.522, the Danish krone fell from DKr4.11 to DKr4.14 and
sterling was down from DM2.5025 to DM2.4750.
The dollar also came under strong pressure against the D-Mark, undermined
again by more poor US data. Factory goods orders for July fell 2.1 per cent,
worse than the market's already pessimistic forecast of a 1.7 per cent drop.
The US currency ended at DM1.6490 from a previous DM1.6595. Dealers
continued to focus on today's non-farm payroll figure as the most important
indicator of where the dollar is going in the short term. Expectations are
for a rise of 144,000 in the headline figure for August, but some analysts
wondered last night whether recent data hinted at a lower number. In New
York the dollar finished around DM1.6450.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather worries soya traders
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ONLY a few weeks to go until the start of the US soyabean harvest,
Chicago commodity futures traders are keeping open telephone lines to
private weather forecasters.
The weather men have the rapt attention of the market at the moment because
late-planted crops and surplus moisture have delayed soyabean plant
development. The lateness of the crop makes it vulnerable to early frost,
while prolonged periods of fine weather will increase yields and produce a
larger harvest.
A 'weather market' is characteristically volatile, and Chicago soyabean
prices this week have certainly been that.
Talk of an early frost abated on Monday when the National Weather Service
forecast normal temperatures in the maize and soyabean belt for the coming
week. The long-term 30-day forecast predicted normal to below normal
temperatures, but contained no indication of a late September frost.
Futures prices for soyabeans to be delivered in November, just after
harvest, dropped by more than 10 cents a bushel on Tuesday at the Chicago
Board of Trade in response to the forecast and by a similar amount on
Wednesday, ending at Dollars 6.54 3/4 a bushel.
Private forecasters, traders said, had confirmed the government's weather
predictions.
Yesterday morning, however, soyabean futures steadied as managed futures
funds bought back short positions taken out earlier in the week and the
November price bounced to Dollars 6.62 1/2 a bushel. In late trading the
price had settled back to Dollars 6.57 a bushel, up 2 1/4 cents on the day,
but that was still well below the summertime high of Dollars 7.57 1/2 a
bushel.
Mr Gerry Gidel, crop analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago, says that
the only predictable feature in the soyabean market until harvest time will
be uncertainty.
'People are still trying to determine yields. We get weekly crop progress
numbers, and we can tell the crop is maturing.'
However, he said, it was difficult to determine how productive the plants
were.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers optimistic as cereal
yield falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FARMERS could be reaping 5 per cent less cereal in this year's harvest
compared to last year but their optimism is undented after an improvement in
incomes for the first time in four years.
Returns to UK farmers are expected to be higher this year in spite of a
slightly worse harvest than expected, according to Dalgety Agriculture,
because the lower value of the pound has made crops more competitive
overseas.
Sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and the consequent
fall in the value of the pound meant an additional Pounds 135m in European
Community support payments for UK farmers in the final quarter of last year.
'There's a mood of general relief that we've bottomed out of the downward
spiral, said Mr Rad Thomas who has a 400-acre farm in Leicestershire.
'Before anyone starts saying farmers are seeing a big rise in income, you've
got to remember that we've come from the lowest base since the 1930s
depression and if we hadn't had this increase, a lot of farms would have
gone under.'
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the
devaluation of sterling had given farmers a short breathing space. 'Most
sectors have the opportunity to be profitable this year and these were in
deep trouble last year.'
But farmers are under pressure to cut costs and many are still giving up -
the NFU estimates that about 20 people leave the land each day.
Mr Adrian Peck, who employs two men on his 1,000-acre arable farm in
Cambridgeshire, does not look forward to cutting costs any further. 'If I
have to cut back on machinery and labour costs, I've just got to make my
fields bigger and that's a prospect that horrifies me. I'd become a
prairie-farmer because that's the only way to cut manpower costs.'
Nevertheless, Mr Peck is looking to buy a new tractor this year following
three years when he did not invest in any machinery. Many farmers are
planning equipment purchases with tractor sales up 20 per cent in the first
half of the year according to the Agricultural Engineers' Association.
Dalgety, which surveys 800 farms, suggests that in some parts of the country
wheat yields will be affected by heavy rainfall at the beginning of the
harvest season.

The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market was stuck in a weaker trend
throughout the afternoon, with the December position closing Pounds 2 above
the day's low at Pounds 820 a tonne, Pounds 9 down on the day. Dealers said
prices were being allowed to slip back in the absence of manufacturer
buying. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices built on early gains and
the three months position closed Dollars 17.50 higher at Dollars 1,953 a
tonne, despite a slight narrowing in the cash premium. Dealers said heavy
buying from quarters influential in supporting the market recently ensured
that there was to be no price collapse. Early firmness in the NICKEL market
was not maintained, with European merchant selling and profit-taking eating
into gains. The three months delivery price, which had touched Dollars
4,700, closed at Dollars 4,596.50 a tonne, down Dollars 32. Further losses
were registered in after hours trading. TIN prices mounted a small rally
from fresh 20-year lows, but remained depressed by poor fundamentals. The
three months position closed unchanged at Dollars 4,677.50 a tonne.
ALUMINIUM was steadier, regaining most of the week's earlier losses.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Property Market: A tough value judgment - The way UK
property valuations are calculated is a controversial subject, with critics
claiming that clients are being misled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The subject of valuations still stirs up heated debate in the UK property
industry. Critics of current methods, including bankers, academics and
property companies, argue that the way chartered surveyors calculate and
present property valuations can mislead clients and contribute to the
volatility of the market.
These concerns have prompted the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to
set up a working party on trends in client demand for commercial valuation
advice. The aim, according to Mr Clive Lewis, president of the RICS, is to
reassess what clients want from valuation advice and to clear 'our minds of
the preconceptions of the past'.
The group, headed by Mr Michael Mallinson, former property director of
Prudential Portfolio Managers, includes clients, valuers and an academic
researcher. It will canvass the views of property clients and professionals
before it reports in February.
The debate in the industry about property valuations is taking place on two
levels.
First, are valuers giving their clients enough information about the risk
factors associated with the valuation and the way it was arrived at? Are
valuations producing the figures clients understand and expect? Should
valuers express an opinion about the future trend in a property's value?
The difficulties with the current system are unlikely to be entirely the
fault of surveyors. Members of the Association of Property Bankers, which
was set up recently to discuss property issues, believe that
misunderstandings about the nature of a valuation are partly the fault of
the client. The association is now putting together a code of practice for
bankers on how to instruct valuers.
'If non-property people go to a valuer, they believe they are getting advice
when all they are getting is a valuation,' says Mr Richard Lovell, president
of the association.
He argues that banks need more than a valuation; they need 'a character
analysis' of the property, which could include questions of liquidity, its
sensitivity to fluc-tuations on the market, problems of lease structure and
allied risks.
Second, and more controversially, is the thinking behind a valuation
fundamentally flawed? Does the 'open market' method of valuation, which
relies on the prices fetched by comparable buildings, pay insufficient
regard to the intrinsic worth of a building in terms of the income it can
generate for its owner?
Capital &amp; Counties, a property company which is one of the most vocal
critics of existing valuation principles, recently produced a discussion
paper on accounting treatment for investment properties. It concluded that
the current basis of valuation did not work well for certain types of
property - those that rarely came on to the market and for which there was
little comparable evidence of sales. Instead, the property's valuation
should reflect its 'value in use' to its owner.
CapCo also argued that, in difficult market conditions such as those of
recent years, a valuer might not be able to obtain accurate information
about transactions, because of confidentiality clauses and agreements that
are kept secret.
Another of CapCo's arguments in favour of changing valuation methods was the
fact that property investment decisions will increasingly be driven by
comparison with other, non-property forms of investment.
The company concluded that an approach was needed 'which is adaptable to
changing market conditions and to circumstances where there is a lack of
relevant comparable evidence and encourages valuers to value on an
investment basis as well as have regard to comparable evidence.
'A proper assessment of the value of fixed assets under such conditions
requires an analytical interpretation of future growth rates and interest
rates, of the changing nature of the market for all forms of investment and
of the inherent investment characteristics of the assets.'
The idea of including subjective issues, such as expectations of future
growth rates, or extrapolating past trends in a valuation is highly
controversial. One individual's opinion about future trends cannot be as
valuable as that of the market, which is the summation of many individual
viewpoints, say opponents. Moreover, if valuers had more discretion about
the assumptions underpinning the valuations, they might come under pressure
from a client wanting to massage the figures.
In the end, say the defenders of the existing system, the value of a
building is what somebody is willing to pay for it.
They also draw comfort from the apparent accuracy of valuations. A recently
published report by Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors, and the Investment
Property Databank, a research group, which compared investment valuations
with actual prices paid, concluded: 'Valuation surveyors are still achieving
levels of accuracy as high as those produced in the much less volatile
market circumstances of the mid-1980s.'
The concern that the accuracy of valuations would deteriorate as the
investment market became less active and provided less evi-dence on which
valuers could base their judgments proved groundless.
However, some critics of current techniques think that this type of research
does not go to the heart of the problem. A report by the RICS about research
priorities, published earlier this year, said that the debate has centred on
the methods of examining the empirical data on valuations and sale prices,
not on the process by which sale prices are achieved and whether existing
valuations have any influence on the market price.
'The empirical work is therefore taking place in a vacuum,' it said. It
believed that the recessionary market of the early 1990s had exposed a basic
flaw in the philosophy of valuations. 'The fundamental problem is the
over-reliance on a methodology which is effectively one of simple comparison
and not an investment method from first principles.
'The last 30 years have seen the valuation profession become very insular in
outlook, such that the valuation of an investment property from first
principles appears to present the profession with a major problem.'
If the property market continues its recovery, the motivation for some of
the critics of valuation methods - who thought the value of their property
was unduly depressed - could disappear. Nonetheless, the intensity of the
debate suggests that the pressure on the surveying industry to re-examine
its valuation philosophy will remain.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Spate of auctions exaggerates effect of
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond investors seized the opportunity to bank profits
yesterday following recent sharp rallies. The sell-off was exaggerated as
many dealers kept back funds to take advantage of a spate of bond auctions
yesterday.
It was further compounded by a shiver of nervousness emanating from
Belgium's decision to raise interest rates and sharp currency falls against
a surging D-Mark.
Finally, many investors were shifting funds back into shorter-dated
maturities following the phenomenal rallies at the long end over recent
weeks. This was particularly true in France, where even apologists have
become slightly nervous over the extent of the rally.
Yesterday, the main focus was on a Treasury auction of FFr13.1bn of 10-year
paper and FFr6.4bn of 30-year paper. There had been concern that the slowing
trend for rate cuts would leave auctions less attractive than for previous
issues. However, the 10-year bonds with a 6.75 per cent coupon were actively
bid, with the auction covered 1.9 times and the average yield at 6.17 per
cent.
Dealers said most of the buying was carried out by market makers needing to
cover short positions after selling heavily to overseas investors,
particularly Japanese life insurance companies. Recent intervention by the
US Federal Reserve has persuaded Japanese investors that the yen is unlikely
to rise further in the short term so they have been expatriating funds in
order to consolidate the currency's strength.
The shift of attention from the secondary market sent French debt prices
lower. The September futures contract traded on the Matif fell half a point
before recovering to close 14 basis points lower at 123.42.
BELGIAN government bond prices were hit by the newly independent central
bank's decision to hoist interest rates to protect the currency.
Most investors are unconvinced that the central bank will be able to keep
the currency strong in the face of very high government debt. They believe
it will have to cut rates and weaken the currency to reduce the interest
payable on the public deficit.
However, the short-term shock, in the face of a Europe-wide climate of low
rates, sent bond prices reeling. The 10 per cent coupon maturing in April
1996 fell two percentage points at worst and closed one and a half points
down at 106.50. The debt futures market saw record volatility and turnover.
SPANISH government bonds fell sharply initially as traders prepared their
dealing positions for up to Pta1,000bn of supply, but rallied later. In the
event, the Treasury allocated only Pta558.97bn against bids totalling
Pta1,571bn at the tender for three, five and 10-year paper. There was an
immediate squeeze in the market and the Bonos futures contract for September
traded in Barcelona shot up one and a half points before settling a net 55
basis points higher at 100.70. Portuguese bonds were weaker after the
Treasury issued Es15bn of 10.625 per cent 10-year paper at an average 9.6101
per cent.
LONG GILTS were a point lower at one stage as investors took profits in the
face of the turbulence in Europe and weaker sterling. Buyers at lower levels
ensured that most maturities stabilised later. The gilt futures contract for
December closed half a point lower at 113.20.
SENTIMENT in the German government bond market was lifted by strength in the
D-Mark and comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president.
The September bund futures contract on Liffe closed 17 basis points higher
at 98.36, but 10-year bunds closed slightly lower.
US TREASURY prices posted fresh gains across the board yesterday on reports
that the Federal Reserve had been buying securities for foreign central
banks.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was up  23/32 at 102 15/16 ,
yielding 6.034 per cent, a record low. At the short end, the two-year note
was up  3/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 3.809 per cent.
Prices were firmer from the opening. Economic news was mixed - weekly
jobless claims fell unexpectedly, while July factory orders dropped 2.1 per
cent, a larger than forecast decline - and had little impact. Instead,
prices were buoyed by reports of the Fed buying two-year and five-year notes
on behalf of European central banks and by continued demand from mutual fund
buyers, which has exacerbated a shortage of supply at the long end.
Otherwise, attention was focused on today's employment report for August.
Analysts expect a rise of about 150,000 in non-farm payrolls.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Austria establishes benchmark in
long-dated Euroyen sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Austria established a new benchmark in the long end of the
Euroyen market yesterday when it raised Y60bn through an offering of 12-year
Eurobonds.
The issue, which was priced against the World Bank's 10-year yen global bond
in the absence of an underlying Japanese government bond, had a mixed
reception.
Some bankers said the spread on Austria's issue was five basis points too
tight, based on a theoretical 12-year Japanese government bond yield.
However, the lead manager, Yamaichi International, said the pricing was
justified by the quality of the borrower and current demand among investors
for long-dated paper.
The pricing also reflected Yamaichi's view that Japanese interest rates will
be cut in the near future, increasing the attraction of the bonds' coupon of
4 1/2 per cent.
Weakness in the Japanese government bond market yesterday resulted in
Austria's issue being launched at a spread of 13 basis points over the yield
on the World Bank's yen global bond, compared with an intended spread of 17
basis points.
By late afternoon, the spread had widened to 15 basis points. Yamaichi said
that around half of the issue had been placed by yesterday afternoon. When
the bonds were freed to trade they were quoted within fees at 99.68 bid,
compared with an issue price of par.
Meanwhile, two sovereign borrowers are getting ready to launch dollar global
bond issues. Portugal has awarded a mandate to Merrill Lynch and IBJ
International. Italy is expected to announce its offering by the end of
September.
In the dollar sector, Credit Local de France issued Dollars 300m of
three-year Eurobonds priced to yield 18 basis points over the 4 3/8 per cent
US Treasury of 1996. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 4 1/4 per cent,
offered a small yield pick-up over a similar deal launched by General
Electric Capital Corp earlier this week.
Some bankers said the pricing of Credit Local's deal raised questions about
how it had met its dollar funding target, which they said was 20 basis
points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). However, an official
involved in arranging the deal said that Credit Local's target was less
aggressive and had been achieved through a swap.
Irish Permanent Building Society made its debut in the international bond
market, raising Pounds 100m with a five-year offering of floating-rate notes
(FRNs). The lead manager, UBS, said the notes offered a substantial yield
pick-up over recent sterling FRNs in order to attract investors to this new
name.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Thai groups rush to tap
Eurobond and warrant sectors - Victor Mallet writes from Bangkok on the
latest vogues in debt issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year has seen a string of dollar-denominated convertible Eurobonds and
baht debentures with warrants announced by Thai companies.
The trigger for the wave of issues was last year's Securities and Exchange
Commission act, which established Thailand's SEC, allowed public companies
to issue baht debt and removed some of the legal and fiscal obstacles to the
issuing of Eurobonds.
Demand for the new instruments was ensured by the relatively high rates of
interest charged by Thai banks for baht loans and by the buoyant state of
the local stock exchange.
Among those raising cash through Eurobonds convertible into their shares -
typical amounts are between Dollars 40m and Dollars 80m - are finance
houses, chemical companies and property groups such as Land and House and
Hemaraj Land.
More than 20 companies have made plans to raise money through baht
debentures, usually with warrants and terms of about five years.
Mr Korn Chatikavanij, managing director of Jardine Fleming Thanakom
Securities, which is lead-managing several new issues, says Thai companies
could raise the equivalent of about Bt10bn (Dollars 398m) this year through
Euroconvertibles, and almost as much again through baht debentures.
'Thailand is catching on to tradeable debt paper,' says Mr Chris Drake, a
director of Standard Chartered Thailand. SCT is advising General Finance and
Securities on a Bt1bn debenture and warrant issue.
Thai companies are tapping the Eurobond market because of the wide
differential between Thai and US interest rates which exists in spite of the
Thai baht closely tracking the US dollar; the dollar is believed to account
for about 80 per cent of the currency basket used by the Thai authorities to
fix baht exchange rates.
Instead of paying 12 or 13 per cent interest to a Thai bank, companies can
pay perhaps 6 per cent via a Eurobond; in some cases they have made the bond
redeemable at a fixed baht-dollar exchange rate, eliminating what little
exchange risk there is. The only drawback is the prospect of earnings per
share dilution when the bonds are converted.
For investors, convertible bonds are a bet on the growing Thai economy and
the Thai stock exchange. 'It's a booming business,' says Mr Ong Soon Teik of
SCT. 'It's going to be attractive as long as there's this wide spread
between Thai and US interest rates.'
Debentures are also attractive cost-savers for Thai companies, especially
those without the standing to issue Eurobonds, because the speculative value
of warrants allows them to pay lower interest rates than those available
from banks, and to pay a fixed rate over several years if they wish.
'A lot of listed companies are going to bypass the bankers for funds,' says
Mr Ong.
Some stockbrokers are cautious about the enthusiasm for debentures and warn
of a lack of liquidity and inadequate regulation. The debenture fad, they
say, is a classic sign of a market approaching its peak.
Although some prospective borrowers are blue chip companies, others have a
less than impressive track record.
There is no trustee system for bonds in Thailand, and the regulations for
the secondary debt market and for debt rating agencies have not yet been
firmly established or clarified, although one such agency - Thai Rating and
Information Services or Tris - has started operations. 'It's very
dangerous,' says one foreign stockbroker. 'Debt markets require a lot of
regulation.'
Others are not so gloomy. 'The market can really develop properly if there
is liquidity,' says Mr Korn of Jardine Fleming Thanakom. 'All the major
finance houses are gearing themselves to be active market makers.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: US retailers report mixed sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE US retailers yesterday reported a wide range of sales results for
August, indicating only a sporadic recovery in the sector.
Chicago-based department store group Sears, Roebuck continued to lead the
pack with a 10.9 per cent gain in domestic same-store sales last month. Mr
Arthur Martinez, the merchandise group's chairman, said there were gains in
almost all merchandising lines with strong results in appliances and
apparel.
Kmart, the discount store and speciality retailer, saw a 3.4 per cent
improvement in comparable store sales. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said
the company had 'a broadening of the strength seen in June and July when the
improvement was more concentrated in basic consumable items and seasonal
merchandise lines'.
Wal-Mart Stores, top-selling US retailer, said same-store sales rose 4 per
cent in August, compared with 9 per cent in July. Same-store sales for the
company's Sam's Clubs fell 7 per cent in the month. The company blamed
'cannibalisation in many of the Sam's markets, coupled with disinflation in
key merchandise categories'.
Woolworth posted a 2.6 per cent drop in domestic comparable store sales in
August, compared with a 3.3 per cent fall in July.
Federated Department Stores, which includes the Bloomingdale's and Bon
Marche chains, saw comparable store sales advance 2.1 per cent for the
month, compared with July's 0.2 per cent decline.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pfizer's shares surge as valve
claims are settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER, the big US pharma-ceutical company, yesterday said it had settled
the bulk of lawsuits involving its Shiley heart valve.
Pfizer would not reveal the terms of the settlement but said it would have
no material adverse effect on its finances. The news helped lift shares in
Pfizer Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 on Wall Street by the close.
Mr Paul Miller, Pfizer's general counsel, said: 'We continue to believe
there is no basis for people with functioning valves to recover damages, but
the company wants to put this time-consuming and costly litigation behind it
and to focus on more productive activities.'
Pfizer has been involved with Shiley litigation for many years. While the
company has never admitted that the valve is defective, about 400 recipients
of the artificial heart valve have died or suffered from its fracture. It
was taken off the world market in 1986.
In 1992, the company forwarded a plan to resolve disputes in a Cincinnati
court which included a Dollars 215m class action settlement plus Dollars
300m in reserves for fracture claims. Earlier this year, a California
appeals court upheld a ruling allowing non-California residents to file
Shiley-related lawsuits in the state.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Browning-Ferris in Dollars 520m
takeover
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BROWNING-Ferris Industries, one of the biggest US waste management
companies, is to acquire Western Waste Industries in a share-swap deal
valued at about Dollars 520m. The deal includes the acquisition of about
Dollars 90m of Western's debt.
Browning-Ferris said the merger would expand its core waste services
business signifi- cantly, especially in southern California.
The combined companies will have revenues of more than Dollars 3.6bn, of
which about Dollars 230,000 will be from Western's operations.
On Wall Street, shares in Western soared Dollars 3 to Dollars 20, while
Browning-Ferris fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 .
Under the terms of the letter of intent, each share of Western common stock
would be exchanged for 1.02 shares in Browning-Ferris. The deal is subject
to renegotiation if Browning-Ferris' common share price rises above Dollars
30 or falls below Dollars 20. Browning does not expect the acquisition to
dilute earnings.
Western has agreed not to invite bids or inquiries from other parties while
the transaction is pending.
The merger is expected to be a tax-free reorganisation which would be
accounted for as pooling of interests.
Although analysts expect Browning-Ferris to benefit from the move into
southern California, some were concerned that it had paid too much for
Western.
Western's shares have closed no higher than Dollars 17 in the past 52 weeks,
and the stock's all-time high is Dollars 23 1/2 .
Mr Vishnu Swarup, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said there was 'a lot
of room for cost reductions and synergies. I think it's a good fit. It will
double BFI's market share in Los Angeles and increase its presence in
Houston, New Orleans and other markets.'
In recent years, Browning- Ferris has been plagued by permit problems at its
largest landfills, in addition to the pricing pressures felt throughout the
entire industry.
The company's earnings fell steadily in the early 1990s before starting to
improve this year. Net income for the nine months ended June was Dollars
144.4m, including a pre-tax reorganisation charge of Dollars 27m, compared
with net income of Dollars 125.4m a year earlier.
It said most of its third-quarter revenue growth came from acquisitions. It
completed 33 acquisitions in North America during the quarter, with
annualised revenues of about Dollars 41m.

<TEXT>
THE first investment fund supported by the US and Russian governments as
well as private American institutions was announced yesterday by
Vice-President Albert Gore and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, at a White House ceremony.
The Russia Country Fund will enable US financial institutions, such as
pension funds, for the first time to invest directly in private enterprises
in Russia and other former Soviet republics, with their investments
partially guaranteed by the US government.
The closed-end fund seeks to raise Dollars 100m in project finance and
venture capital for new businesses, expansions and privatisation, with an
emphasis on enterprises in the energy and environmental fields.
The Russian government will contribute up to Dollars 25m. The Overseas
Private Investment Corp (Opic), a US government agency set up to encourage
American investment in emerging economies, will provide a Dollars 50m loan
guarantee to protect private institutions providing the additional capital.
Investors will be offered what Opic described as a 'blended instrument',
composed of one-third equity and two-thirds debt. The agency will extend
guarantees on the principal and interest of the debt portion.
The precise terms of the Opic guarantee have yet to be finalised, according
to PaineWebber, the US securities house which will jointly manage the fund
with International Economic Co-operation, a Moscow investment management
company.

A R250m (Dollars 74.2m) rights offer opens today for Eastvaal Gold, the
company financing the development of the R1.7bn Moab gold mine, one of the
largest high-grade gold deposits remaining in South Africa.
Eastvaal, which until now has been privately held within the Anglo American

month.
The Moab project will be the No 11 shaft at the Vaal Reefs complex, one of
South Africa's richest gold mines. Vaal Reefs is managed by the Anglo
American group, the world's largest gold producer.
Production at Moab will start in 1997. In peak production years, it will
produce between 12 and 13 tonnes a year, at an estimated recovery grade of
11.2 grams/tonne.
The issue will cover the after-tax capital expenditure on the project until
early 1995.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Avon warns of shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVON PRODUCTS, the US cosmetics, toiletries and jewellery group, yesterday
warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of its results for the
same period of 1992. Last time it posted net income of Dollars 53.9m, or 75
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 938.8m.
With analysts anticipating earnings per share of about 85 cents in the
current quarter, the news prompted a sharp reaction on Wall Street. Avon's
shares closed Dollars 4 1/2 down at Dollars 55 in heavy trading.
Avon blamed the third-quarter performance on the continued sluggishness of
the US economy, combined with the cost of implementing 'changes designed to
reorient and redirect the US business'.
But the company is optimistic that sales and earnings will improve and
expects fourth-quarter and full-year results to show increases over
comparable 1992 periods.
Best known for its worldwide force of door-to-door sales representatives,
Avon has nearly quadrupled advertising spending this year, mainly to support
Avon Select, a direct marketing scheme allowing customers to order products
by telephone, fax or mail.

director

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lee Iacocca, who retired as chairman of Chrysler last December, yesterday
unexpectedly resigned as a director of the automotive group and chairman of
its boardroom executive committee.
His departure marks the end of an era at Chrysler. The outgoing, feisty Mr
Iacocca has been synonymous with the company since the late 1970s, when he
joined from Ford Motor and saved the business from bankruptcy.
Mr Iacocca had been scheduled to remain as chairman of the executive
committee until the end of 1994. The company said there had been no pressure
on him to resign. The decision had been strictly Mr Iacocca's.
Mr Robert Eaton, who succeeded Mr Iacocca as chairman of the group, will now
also take over as head of the executive committee. Mr Iacocca, 68, will
remain as a Chrysler consultant to the end of 1994.
Mr Iacocca said: 'It's not fashionable for former chief executives to serve
on the boards of their companies any more. It's been a fantastic ride but
it's time to let the younger people do the driving.'
Observers noted the move could also give him greater freedom to dispose of
his large shareholding in the company.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cost controls help Sasol to 14%
profits increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals group, out-performed
stock market expectations in the year ended June, lifting net attributable
profits by 14.4 per cent, to R1.3bn (Dollars 386m), and paying a higher
dividend.
Higher volumes and currency depreciation helped raise turnover 5 per cent to
R8.25bn, despite mostly weaker selling prices.
Pre-tax profits rose 19.9 per cent to R1.84bn, reflecting reduced interest
charges of R122m - against R228.6m - and stringent cost control.
The company, which estimates a modest improvement in earnings for the
current year, is stepping up its dividend from 78 cents a share to 86 cents.
Costs rose by only 3.5 per cent, well below the inflation rate. This was
largely due to a 15 per cent cut in staff numbers. Mr Joe Stegmann,
chairman, said the cost performance went well beyond normal belt-tightening.
The increase in attributable earnings includes provision for R100m to be
transferred to a tax equalisation fund. This is in anticipation of a jump in
the group's tax rate, to more than 30 per cent next year from less than 20
per cent this year as various tax allowances lapse.
A divisional breakdown of group profits shows that 41 per cent came from
synthetic fuels, 22 per cent from coal, 25 per cent from crude oil refining,
fuels marketing and gas, and 12 per cent from petrochemicals, fertilisers,
explosives and polymers.
The good parts of the group's performance had been higher sales volumes and
better profits from coal and fuels marketing. These were counteracted by
lower refining margins and severely depressed chemicals prices.
Mr Kruger said the proposed joint venture with AECI's plastics and
chlor-alkali business would go ahead subject to competition board approval.

WESTERN Mining, the Australian commodities producer, reports a modest

10 cents a share.
Equity accounted net profit improved 3 per cent to ADollars 165.9m
(USDollars 110.6m), helped by improved contributions from aluminium, copper
and uranium. The result, on a 2 per cent sales fall to ADollars 1.61bn,
stemmed mostly from continued strong results at the company's integrated

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Delta warns it may cut routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, one of the three big US carriers, has warned it may have to
cancel unprofitable routes. The warning comes despite an improvement in its
loss-making transatlantic routes over the summer.
Mr Ron Allen, chairman, admitted that the company's foray into Europe had
been more difficult than expected. Delta was essentially a domestic carrier
until it bought Pan Am's transatlantic routes two years ago.
'We have had lower market share, poorer economic conditions, higher
structural costs and greater start-up costs than anticipated over the north
Atlantic,' he said. 'Pan Am had a name that was known around the world.
Delta's name is not that well known around the world.'
Mr Allen said Delta's transatlantic performance had improved between June
and August, with its load factor rising to 73 per cent from 70 per cent and
revenues at its Frankfurt hub up about 50 per cent. Although he would not
say whether the routes had been profitable over summer, he did say: 'If we
can keep on the present trends, then I think it (the transatlantic routes)
can be a profitable contributor in 1994.'
The carrier has already cancelled some of its German routes. Mr Allen said:
'We will do more of this as we look at our summer results and decide which
routes cannot be profitable.' Some routes may be consolidated. He said Delta
had no plans to leave any markets entirely, nor was it planning a radical
restructuring.

A R250m (Dollars 74.2m) rights offer opens today for Eastvaal Gold, the

largest high-grade gold deposits remaining in South Africa.
Eastvaal, which until now has been privately held within the Anglo American

The Moab project will be the No 11 shaft at the Vaal Reefs complex, one of

Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Eastvaal and Anglo's gold and uranium division,
said the project was a vote of confidence in the future of gold. He believes
the gold market will have tightened by the turn of the decade, when the mine
comes fully on stream.
Production at Moab will start in 1997. In peak production years, it will
produce between 12 and 13 tonnes a year, at an estimated recovery grade of
11.2 grams/tonne. The mine will have a life of 28 years.
The issue will cover the after-tax capital expenditure on the project until
early 1995. In escalated terms, it will eventually cost R3.1bn to bring the
mine to full production.

US economy, combined with the cost of implementing 'changes designed to
reorient and redirect the US business'.
The company, best known for its worldwide force of door-to-door sales
representatives, has nearly quadrupled its advertising spending this year,
primarily to support Avon Select, a direct marketing scheme allowing
customers to order beauty products by telephone, fax or mail.
'If customers would start to spend as a result of the increased advertising,
we would be fine,' Avon said.
In the second quarter, Avon's US sales gained 2 per cent on the prior year,
but pre-tax profit on the domestic side slid 7 per cent because of the
stepped-up marketing effort.
However, the company is optimistic that sales and earnings will improve
during the remainder of the year, and expects fourth-quarter and full-year
results to show increases over comparable periods of 1992.

AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, has increased sales,
earnings and dividends in the year ended June, despite recession in many of
its key markets.
The company yesterday announced an 18 per cent net profit rise to ADollars
314.9m (USDollars 212.7m) on a 17 per cent sales lift to ADollars 4.82bn.
The dividend is going up from 29 cents to 31 cents. Earnings benefited from
extra liquidity following the sale of the remaining interest in former
transport associate Mayne Nickless.
Asset disposals produced an ADollars 68.5m abnormal gain.

CARGILL, the Minneapolis-based international commodities merchandising firm,
reported a 20 per cent slide in fiscal year 1993 earnings, to Dollars 348m.
Sales for the year rose slightly to Dollars 47bn, while cash flow, at
Dollars 1.01bn, dropped slightly.
The secretive and closely-held company only began reporting results last
year, when it initiated a employee stock ownership programme.
Cargill said despite the earnings decline, fiscal 1993 was its third-best
year in its 130-year history.
Mr Robert Lumpkins, senior vice-president and chief financial officer, said
operations within the US were stronger than ever.
However, activity outside North America was adversely affected by reduced
acreage in the EC, currency fluctuations, political instability within parts
of South America, and continuing credit problems among Cargill's leading
customers, including the former Soviet Union.
'Many of the economic and other factors negatively influencing the global
business environment had been anticipated,' Mr Lumpkins said.

<TEXT>
CANADA'S two biggest chartered banks have reported much improved results for
the third quarter, despite continuing property and corporate loan problems.
Royal Bank of Canada's net profit for the three months ended July was
CDollars 223m (USDollars 168.9m), or 58 cents a share, double the CDollars
112m, or 26 cents, of the 1992 period.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 720m, or CDollars 1.93, up 24 per cent from
CDollars 580m, or CDollars 1.58. Return on assets was 0.69 per cent against
0.57 per cent and on equity 13.4 per cent against 10.3 per cent.
Although loan losses were higher, the trend in revenues and expenses was
favourable. Results benefited from higher fee income and good results from
the brokerage subsidiary. Loan losses this year will total CDollars 1bn, up
CDollars 180m from April 30.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported net profit of CDollars 190m, or
75 cents a share, in the third quarter, against CDollars 186m, or 75 cents.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 539m, or CDollars 2.24, against a loss of
CDollars 33m, or 68 cents, after a CDollars 1bn special loan loss provision.
Third-quarter net interest income rose 7 per cent and good earnings from
investment banking and heavy home mortgage business helped. The rise in
non-interest expense was held to 4 per cent after including the cost of
entering insurance and trust operations.
Non-performing loans continued to decline and the overall ratio to total
loans was 2.6 per cent at end July, down from 3.1 per cent at the end of
January. The total loan loss provision for fiscal 1993 is being increased by
CDollars 40m to CDollars 920m.
The Canadian brokerage industry, helped by surging stock markets and new
bond and share underwriting business, posted record first-half profits.
The 137 member-firms of the Investment Dealers' Association of Canada,
representing the bulk of the industry, had net profit of CDollars 360m, more
than double the CDollars 169m reported for the first half of 1992. The total
surpassed the previous annual record profit of CDollars 338m set in 1991.
Commissions totalled CDollars 1.07bn, up 55 per cent, and represented 42 per
cent of total gross revenues. Mutual fund (unit trust) commissions now make
up 20 per cent of total commissions.
About CDollars 12bn was raised in new equity in the first half and
underwriting revenues were up 57 per cent to CDollars 580m.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Heineken ahead at midterm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEINEKEN, Europe's largest brewer, reports a first-half rise in net profits
before extraordinary items of 11.3 per cent, but says margins will be
squeezed and the rate of earnings growth will likely slow in the second
half.
Heineken said this slowdown would be due primarily to market conditions, and
was based on the assumption that costs stemming from last week's recall of
3.4m faulty beer bottles could be contained and even recovered.
In the first half, earnings on ordinary operations advanced to Fl 220m
(Dollars 118.2m) from Fl 197.7m. This was in spite of a decline in turnover
to Fl 4.52bn amid weak demand in Europe.
Heineken said it was able to maintain and in some cases extend its market
share in Europe, which accounts for more than two thirds of total turnover,
even though the overall market was in decline with low volume sales.
The decline was particularly pronounced in Spain, Italy, France and the
Netherlands, the group reported, while Asia and North America remained
strong markets for Dutch-brewed exports. Margins were maintained due in part
to robust sales in the premium end of these markets, with lagers sold under
the Heineken and Amstel brand names.
Heineken also attributed its performance to lower restructuring provisions,
and the lower costs that have resulted from earlier rationalisation. The
workforce was reduced 5 per cent to 24,020 over the past year.
Heineken's 51 per cent-owned El Aguila subsidiary cut losses from Pta5.23bn
(Dollars 39.1m) to Pta3.10bn, although the figure for the first half of 1992
included a Pta2.9bn charge for restructuring.

Dutch insurer

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance company,
reported a solid first-half performance despite the dampening effects of
losses in its reinsurance business and weaker earnings in the non-life
sector.
Net profit advanced to Fl 897m (Dollars 480.9m), representing a rise of 8.9
per cent after adjustments which reflect new accounting principles adopted
in the first quarter.
The group announced an interim dividend of Fl 1.60 per share, on a net
per-share profit of Fl 3.62, and also forecast full-year net earn-ings per
share would at least match the adjusted Fl 7.52 of 1992.
ING said it would take a Fl 400m extraordinary charge for its Orion and
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep units, which would be taken from the Fl 2.5bn
extraordinary provision announced earlier this year.
This charge should be sufficient to cover any losses stemming from claims
against the two units, whose financial results have been excluded from the
consolidated ING results from April 1 1993. Their book value has been
written down to zero.
In reinsurance, ING slipped from a first-half profit of Fl 8m to a loss of
Fl 8m this year. Non-life insurance profits before tax slipped back by over
a third to Fl 37m, but showed signs of improvement relative to the first
quarter.
By far the most powerful engine of growth was the banking division, where
pre-tax earnings pushed ahead by 15 per cent, or Fl 84m, to Fl 634m for the
first half, helped particularly by strong returns from the trading
operations.
ING also posted a strong rise in its life insurance unit, particularly in
the Netherlands, North America and Australia; earnings before tax advanced
by Fl 39m to Fl 329m.
The general insurance operation reported a 7.5 per cent advance to Fl 258m.

<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals group which will be among the companies
to spearhead the government's privatisation campaign, yesterday announced an
11 per cent fall in first-half net profits and warned of reduced earnings
for the year as a whole.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, the group's chairman, said that 'unless trading
conditions encountered in the first half of the year improve in the second
half, it is likely that results for the full year will be lower than in
1992'.
The net profits for the first six months of 1993 announced yesterday fell to
FFr1.37bn (Dollars 230m) compared with FFr1.55bn in the same period last
year. This is in line with a warning issued last month. Sales were
FFr40.03bn, about 6 per cent less than the same period in 1992.
Mr Fourtou blamed the downturn on the depressed conditions in Europe,
particularly in Germany, and the fall in demand for chemicals. He said that
the international chemicals market was in its worst ever condition and that
he saw no signs of improvement at least until the end of the year.
He was much more sanguine about the prospects for the sale of the
government's 43 per cent stake in the company. The sale, which will follow
that of Banque Nationale de Paris as part of the government's plans to
privatise 21 state controlled groups, is expected by the end of the autumn.
'The government has asked us to be ready, and we are ready,' said Mr
Fourtou. He said he did not expect problems in forming a core of stable
shareholders to replace the state and that privatisation would allow the
group to raise capital and reduce its debt.
But despite his relaxed approach to the sale of the government's stake, Mr
Fourtou expressed surprise at the rise in the Paris stock market and the
company's share price over recent months. 'I don't see an economic jump next
year to pull the chemicals industry out of the doldrums.' Following
yesterday's results, however, the company's share price fell from FFr161.5
to FFr158.
With the exception of the group's healthcare division, all of the group's
activities suffered falls in profits during the period. The company's
organic and inorganic intermediate chemicals, used in plastics and other
industrial inputs, saw operating profits fall to FFr13m from FFr478m.
The fibres and polymers division suffered a fall in operating profits from
FFr418m in the first half of 1992 to FFr36m in the same period this year.
The agricultural division fell from operating profits of FFr854m to FFr629m.
Health, the one bright spot, raised operating profits from FFr2.15bn to
FFr2.76bn. But the company said the rate of expansion would slow in the
second half of the year.

<TEXT>
THE German government will sell a 45 per cent stake in a Bavarian-based
defence group to Bradduck Dunn McDonald of the US for an undisclosed sum.
The government will sell its stake in Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft
(IABG), 98 per cent owned subsidiary of the Industrieverwaltungsgesellschaft
(IVG), a company holding properties and land. IVG is 50 per cent owned by
the government.
The government said the IABG sale was part of its newly announced plan to
sell state-owned companies.
IABG, which has a turnover of DM324m (Dollars 195.1m) and employs 1,500
people, is active in manufacturing software and logistics systems used by
the German defence ministry. It is also involved in running one of the three
testing centres of the European Space Agency, according to the finance
ministry in Bonn.
The federal ministry for research and development will retain an option to
take over the activities of IABG in the testing centre through a subsidiary
of the German Institute for Aerospatial Research, created for this purpose.
IABG reported profits in 1992 after three consecutive years of losses, due
to fewer contracts in the defence sector. Turnover last year rose by 13 per
cent.
The government said it would keep a 15 per cent stake in IABG and the rest,
excluding the US group's holding, is expected to be placed with German
companies.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ahlstrom gets FM1.45bn for its
Enso-Gutzeit stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AHLSTROM, the Finnish machinery and paper group, yesterday placed its 17.5
per cent stake in Enso-Gutzeit, one of Finland's leading forestry groups,
with international investors for FM1.45bn (Dollars 246m).
The stake was acquired a year ago as payment for 100,000 hectares of forest
in south-eastern Finland.
It is a highly profitable deal for Ahlstrom as it gained FM38.7 for each of
the 37.4m shares sold, compared with an acquisition value of FM20 per share.
The price reflects the strong performance of the Finnish forestry sector
this year where exports have climbed sharply, despite weak market
conditions, due to the 30 per cent depreciation of the markka since November
1991.
The shares were placed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd at just under the FM39.3
price at which they closed on the Helsinki stock exchange on Wednesday.
Ahlstrom received both R class and A class shares when it sold its forest
land to Enso last December in a FM926m deal. All the R class shares,
carrying one-tenth of a vote, are now being sold, but the group is retaining
its holding of 6.6m one-vote A class shares which it acquired for FM27 each.
Mr Krister Ahlstrom, chief executive, said the proceeds would be used to pay
down the group's debt, which at the end of last year stood at FM8.6bn.
He said Ahlstrom had always intended to sell the shares when the price
reached a certain target, but he had been surprised at how quickly this had
been met. 'This was not a strategic holding,' he said, adding that the
company was likely to sell its remaining shares in due course.
Enso-Gutzeit is Europe's largest producer of sawn timber and liquid
packaging board, and the continent's fourth largest producer of newsprint.
The state remains its largest shareholder, directly or indirectly
controlling 58 per cent of the shares and 78 per cent of the votes.

first half

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest banking group, staged a
strong recovery in the first half from deeply depressed profits in the same
period of last year.
Net income from ordinary operations doubled to SFr719m (Dollars 492.8m),
enabling the group to achieve a 10.7 per cent return on equity, slightly
above its 10 per cent target.
Mr Georges Blum, new SBC chief executive, said that the good result was
achieved in exceptional circumstances. Profits from trading in securities,
foreign exchange and futures and options markets soared 128 per cent to
SFr1.55bn, due to bubbling stock markets and often chaotic currency markets.
Also, return on equity in the first half was still rather less than the 13
per cent and 15 per cent figures already reported by its Swiss rivals, Union
Bank of Switzerland and CS Holding.
SBC, which has been hurt by a number of spectacular lending misadventures in
recent years, again boosted its loan loss provisions in the first half by 66
per cent to SFr1.24bn.
But Mr Blum said this move mainly reflected worries about the impact of the
recession on the bank's broad base of industrial customers rather than the
discovery of new headline cases. 'There are no more skeletons in the
closet,' he said.
Net interest income was flat at SFr1.5bn in the first half and net
commissions rose 20 per cent to SFr1.2bn, reflecting, in part, the group's
leading position in the Swiss investment fund sector. Assets under
management in funds reached SFr40bn at the end of June, 18 per cent higher
than at the end of last year.
Costs were up only 8.2 per cent, and administrative costs actually fell
SFr41m to SFr714m, partly due to the completion of restructuring at
subsidiary Banca della Svizzera Italiana.
Profit before tax and provisions jumped 75.3 per cent to SFr2.18bn, but the
result was still below the SFr2.76bn and SFr2.4bn earned by UBS and Credit
Suisse respectively at this level.
Mr Blum said SBC could not expect profit to grow as strongly in the second
half, but forecast that net income would exceed last year's 'by a
significant margin'.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Psion restricted to Pounds 1.07m
by US marketing investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PSION, the hand-held computer, software and data communications equipment
manufacturer, reported a marginal increase in interim pre-tax profits
despite a 9 per cent advance in turnover and volume sales gains in most
markets.
The USM-quoted group, which has been investing heavily in its US marketing
operations, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.07m for the six months to
June 30, compared with Pounds 1.05m.
The figures were a little below market expectations and the shares, which
have risen sharply in recent weeks, dropped 9p to 115p.
Mr David Potter, chairman, described the results as 'a satisfactory
performance despite continuing depressed market conditions in Europe'.
He added: 'We have made a substantial investment in marketing in the US and
this, together with a recent reorganisation, has resulted in significant
progress in that market.'
The group has more than tripled the number of retail outlets in the US
market to 650 and expects to have secured 1,000 by the year end.
In the latest period gross profit margins recovered, from the second half of
last year, to 40 per cent, but the marketing investment in the US, totalling
more than Pounds 600,000, held back profits at the pre-tax level.
Earnings per share increased to 3.41p (3.16p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 1p.
Turnover increased to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16.5m) spurred by particularly
strong sales of data communications products in the UK, which grew by 30 per
cent, and of hand-held computers in the US which rose 38 per cent to more
than Pounds 2m.
A 25 per cent sales increase in Germany and the Netherlands helped offset an
11 per cent decline in sales elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Potter said sales of the Series 3 range were strong in the first quarter
but that demand in Europe in the second quarter was weak.
He added that sales in the UK doubled after the company cut prices in June.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ashley Grp returns to the black
with Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHLEY GROUP, the window blinds and timber company, announced a turnround
from pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.9m to profits of Pounds 1.58m in the six
months to June 30.
Mr James White, chairman, said: 'Having completed a satisfactory first half
year's trading, the business seems set to progress in the second half.'
Turnover fell to Pounds 143.4m (Pounds 210.6m), including a Pounds 122.8m
(Pounds 192.2m) contribution from the discontinued Spain-based food retail
operations.
Earnings per share were 0.35p, against losses of 0.83p after adjustment for
the Spanish operations. The company, which passed its final dividend in the
previous 16-month period, is not declaring an interim (0.375p) but will
consider a final.
The window blinds division contributed Pounds 2.69m (Pounds 2.13m) to
operating profits on turnover of Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 17.8m). Ashley said
all its window blind businesses traded satisfactorily, bar Storflex, the
French business, which suffered from the depressed French economy.
Plywood and timber added Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 79,000) to operating profits
on sales of Pounds 713,000 (Pounds 601,000).
Net bank borrowings were Pounds 13.4m, giving gearing of 57 per cent.
Interest charges were Pounds 727,000 (Pounds 666,000), excluding a Pounds
1.94m payment on discontinued operations for which the company provided in
1992.

Northumbrian Fine Foods, the snack food manufacturer that earlier this year
postponed its interim results and suspended its shares, yesterday announc-ed
that the rights issue to raise Pounds 785,000 net was subscribed by 71.2 per

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rathbone Brothers, the private banking and asset management group, yesterday
announced a 25 per cent expansion in interim profits.
On turnover ahead from Pounds 7.84m to Pounds 8.28m, the pre-tax line for
the six months to June 30 emerged at Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.02m).
Mr Oliver Stanley, chairman, said the investment management operation had
consolidated the acquisitions last year of Framlington's private client
business and three Liverpool-based independent investment managers.
Rathbone's trustee activities continued to expand, both in the UK and
abroad, Mr Stanley said.
Earnings per share edged ahead to 8.98p (8.03p); the interim dividend goes
up from 1.5p to 2p to reduce disparity.

senses upturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PCT Group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 751,000 for the six months to
June 30, against Pounds 925,000.
The USM-quoted engineering equipment company blamed adverse economic
conditions in the UK and the Continent.
Directors said that the first half saw no signs of recovery in the UK and
margins remained under pressure. However, there were encouraging prospects
for the present six months, particularly in export markets, but the
unsettled UK market continued to delay improvements in profitability.
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 10.7m). Interest payable fell
to Pounds 278,000 (Pounds 320,000). Earnings per share came out at 6.08p
(7p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p.

From turnover ahead from IPounds 14.2m to IPounds 31.16m (Pounds 29.3m),
Aran Energy, the Dublin-based oil and gas exploration concern, boosted
pre-tax profits from IPounds 38,000 to IPounds 3.29m for the six months to
June 30.
After tax totalling IPounds 759,000 compared with IPounds 164,000 earnings
per share were 0.97p against losses of 0.05p.
Directors explained that the 'much-improved results reflected the group's
increased level of oil and gas production, arising mainly from the
acquisition of an interest in the Dunlin oil field'. This continued to
perform satisfactorily, they added, with the group's 26 per cent share of
production averaging 6,739 barrels per day during the period.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: US gas prices help to lift
British-Borneo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY improved US gas prices and exploration successes, both in the North
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, helped British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate, the
oil and gas exploration and production company, lift after-tax profits by 42
per cent from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 2.94m in the half year to June 30.
Tax totalled Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 186,000) and Mr Alan Gaynor, managing
director, said that following this year's changes to UK oil taxation the
planned oil exploration programme had been rebalanced.
That would mean increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico, he said, where, by
the year-end, the group expected to have drilled a further 12 wells.
Activity in the North Sea would also continue, with the group participating
in five exploration wells within the next six months.
Sir Douglas Morpeth, chairman, said strong cash flow from all operations had
enabled investment in oil and gas activities to continue and debt to be
reduced to Pounds 31.3m against Pounds 33.9m at end-December.
Turnover in the half year more than doubled to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 6.15m).
Earnings per share amounted to 6.52p (4.6p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.667p.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol ahead 12% - Enhanced scrip
dividend pleases market and helps shares rise 15p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Burmah Castrol rose by 15p to 813p yesterday after the lubricants,
chemicals and fuel group announced a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
and an enhanced scrip dividend.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 80.6m to Pounds 90.5m in the six months to
June 30, while sales increased by 18 per cent, from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds
1.35bn.
The group said conditions in the second half of 1993 were likely to be
similar to the first half but the longer-term outlook was encouraging.
Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said that in the second half recession in
continental Europe would be counterbalanced by more favourable conditions in
the rest of the world.
Earnings per share rose by 18 per cent, from 20.2p to 23.8p. The interim
dividend of 16.5p (8.75p) is equivalent in size to the 1992 final dividend
and is being paid earlier than usual. Burmah said no decision had yet been
taken on the size of this year's final.
The enhanced scrip dividend is worth 24.75p and BZW is offering to pay
24.255p cash for each share issued under the offer. Burmah said it would
seek shareholder approval for the scheme. This would also enable it to offer
an enhanced scrip final dividend, but no decision had yet been taken to do
so.
Net gearing, counting Burmah's convertible capital bond as debt, fell from
65 per cent to 63 per cent. Burmah said that if the enhanced scrip dividend
was taken up in full, net gearing would fall by some 10 points and earnings
per share this year would be improved by 4p.
Mr Urquhart said performance from the group's core divisions next year would
benefit from the move into profit of Castrol Syntec, Burmah's synthetic
motor oil, and the Foseco metallurgical chemicals would benefit from a
continuing cost reduction programme.
Burmah has adopted the latest accountancy standard on the treatment of
profits from hyper-inflationary economies - which in the group's case mainly
means Brazil. It said this had reduced profits after tax and minorities by
Pounds 1.7m and would reduce full-year profits by about Pounds 9m.
Burmah said volumes and gross margins in its Castrol lubricants division
increased in spite of lower market demand, with operating profits up by 15
per cent to Pounds 70.8m. Operating profits in chemicals rose 5 per cent to
Pounds 17.8m despite the severe impact of European recession on the
metallurgical division.
COMMENT
The market liked the enhanced scrip dividend, but the underlying operational
performance is even more impressive. Managing to enhance Castrol's volumes
and margins in the current climate is no mean feat, particularly in
continental Europe. The metallurgical businesses of Foseco, bought for
Pounds 260m at the end of 1990, continue to face dire markets, but the group
has moved swiftly to reduce costs, closing large plants in France and Spain.
Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 100m put the shares on a prospective
multiple of 15.3. The shares have had a good run, nearly doubling within two
years, but do not look overvalued even at this level.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale main factor in Microvitec's
rise to Pounds 0.57m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of a lossmaking subsidiary was the main factor behind an
improvement in interim pre-tax profits at Microvitec, the Bradford-based
micro-electronic equipment and software group.
On turnover down from Pounds 25.5m to Pounds 18m, of which Pounds 16.1m
(Pounds 14.4m) related to continuing activities, profits at this USM-quoted
company for the first half of 1993 improved from Pounds 62,000 to Pounds
570,000.
In January the company sold Logitek Distribution to its management. Mr James
Bailey, chairman and chief executive said: 'The immediate benefits of this
were improved profits, a lower interest charge and the freedom to allow
management to concentrate on the core constituents of the business.'
Gearing was cut over the six months to end-June from 82 per cent to 47 per
cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 141,000.
The pre-tax figure was also boosted by an exceptional credit of Pounds
196,000, the result of releasing a provision of Pounds 816,000 less the loss
on the sale of the distribution side of Pounds 620,000.
Mr Bailey said that perhaps the most exciting development during the period
was in Canada where the Silcom offshoot had experienced strong growth and
sales were expected to double in 1993 to CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.1m).
He added that display division continued to be successful in securing high
profile contracts.
Earnings per share came out at 0.8p (0.1p).

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Venables sells most of his Spurs stake to
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's ousted chief executive, yesterday
gave up his three-month legal battle to wrest control of the company, which
controls the north London football club, from Mr Alan Sugar, its chairman.
Mr Venables said he had sold the bulk of his 23 per cent equity stake to a
group of institutional investors for 91p a share, or about Pounds 3m. He
retained only a 2.44 per cent holding.
Tottenham's shares ended the day 9p higher at 104p.
Mr Venables paid 75p for about 2.9m shares when he and Mr Sugar, described
at the time as a dream ticket, took control in mid-1991, mostly using
borrowed money.
He later converted a loan of Pounds 800,000 to the club into about 640,000
shares as part of a Pounds 7m rescue rights issue, at 125p a share, which
was underwritten by Mr Sugar.
Based on these figures, Mr Venables paid an average price of about 85p.
The share sale appears to mark another important victory for Mr Sugar, who
holds a 47.8 per cent stake.
Mr Venables will not now be going ahead with his High Court action, due to
begin in 10 days time, through which he was seeking to force Mr Sugar to
sell his stake to him.
Early in the dispute Mr Sugar offered to buy Mr Venables' stake at 87p a
share, an offer which the former manager and chief executive described at
the time as derisory.
However, Mr Venables faced mounting legal costs, including demands for a
Pounds 300,000 security for future costs. Yesterday Mr Venables said he was
dropping his court action because he did not want to risk incurring huge
costs if he lost the legal battle.
'I could not face the prospect or the risk of losing up to one million
pounds,' he said.
However, Mr Venables, who was originally sacked by Mr Sugar and the
Tottenham board in mid-May, said yesterday he would still be seeking
compensation for unfair dismissal.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reckitt improves 14% to Pounds 153m -
Growth encouraging given background of international recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in sterling helped Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and
toiletries group, report interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 153.2m, up 14.2
per cent from the previous year's Pounds 134.2m, restated at Pounds 82m
under FRS 3, taking account of losses on the sale of its US spice business.
It was pointed out that excluding the exchange rate benefit, sales and
operating profits rose about 3 per cent in the half-year to end-June.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said the growth was encouraging given the
background of international recession.
Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said profit margins had been maintained
thanks to increasing investment in key areas and products and to continuing
efficiency gains. Cash flow was strong, he added. The group increased its
interim dividend from 5.95p to 6.45p because the first half had been 'on
track with our plans,' Mr Sankey said.
Group sales were 9 per cent higher at Pounds 1.07bn, with turnover of
continuing operations up 14 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 172.7m,
up 21 per cent, or 14.3 per cent from continuing operations.
Net interest charges rose from Pounds 17m to Pounds 19.5m because of the
translation of foreign currency payments. Net debt fell to Pounds 311.9m at
the end of the half year, down from Pounds 360.9m a year ago and from Pounds
314.7m at the year-end. Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, said debt should
fall to about Pounds 250m by the end of 1993 barring acquisitions or changes
in exchange rates.
UK operating profits of Pounds 35m were flat with margins held at 19.6 per
cent. Mr Sankey said a poor period for soft drinks offset improved results
from household and pharmaceutical products. Continental Europe contributed
operating profits 10.8 per cent higher at Pounds 50.1m, though in local
currencies profits were static. A decline in profits from Spain offset rises
elsewhere. The reorganisation of the US business pushed North American
operating profits up 35 per cent to Pounds 34.8m and margins up from 10.2 to
11.9 per cent, despite a weaker performance in Canada.
Australasia and Asia raised profits 24 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, an
underlying increase of over 10 per cent. Africa, mainly South Africa,
contributed Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 12.2m). The Latin American business raised
profits 15 per cent to Pounds 11.9m, despite difficulties caused by high
inflation in Brazil.
Earnings per share were 24.88p, up from 7.93p on an FRS 3 basis or from
21.85p on an adjusted basis.
COMMENT
Even Reckitt's management recognises the group is going through a boring
phase while its 1992 strategy of going for investment generated growth takes
time to work through. Underlying growth of 3 per cent is certainly dull. But
Reckitt has its quiet merits. Operating margins of 16.2 per cent are high
and seem sustainable, it pushes out cash, and the dividend keeps moving up.
The shares have been poor performers in the downturn but have had a run up
in recent weeks. On forecasts of about Pounds 280m pre-tax for the year,
against Pounds 248.3m or Pounds 181.7m under FRS 3, the prospective p/e is
14.5 which is neither dear, nor likely to provoke outperformance.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: L&amp;M still in restructuring talks with banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Metropolitan, the debt-laden property company, said yesterday that
talks with its bankers regarding a substantial financial restructuring were
taking longer than previously anticipated.
The company announced in July that it had begun talks aimed at securing
agreement on its second restructuring in three years. These were expected to
be finalised by the end of August.
Directors said yesterday that the 'talks were proceeding well' and they
expected the negotiations to be satisfactorily concluded. L&amp;M will be
sending its 1992 financial statements and a circular to shareholders by the
end of this month.
The company has been struggling since incurring a Pounds 100m loss in 1990,
mainly reflecting provisions against falling property values.
The company said in July that the latest talks were necessitated by the
increase in negative net worth from Pounds 44m to Pounds 120m and because
bank loans and working capital facilities had expired at the end of June.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bowater ahead of City forecasts with Pounds
103m - Shares shed 21p on warning of weaker demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER last night saw its shares close down 21p at 494p after the
packaging, printing and coated products group warned that it had seen some
softening of demand in the last two months.
The fall came in spite of a 64 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds
62.4m to Pounds 102.6m for the six months to June 30. Even stripping out an
exceptional gain of Pounds 7.9m on business disposals, the profit of Pounds
94.7m was 52 per cent ahead and well above analysts' forecasts of Pounds 85m
to Pounds 90m.
But the shares came under heavy pressure, and were down 26p at one point,
after Mr Michael Woodhouse, chairman, said demand had softened in some of
Bowater's markets since the end of June.
'This calls for short-term caution,' he warned. 'Confidence remains
fragile.'
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said fears about President Clinton's tax
plans had caused some weakening of the US market, and orders had slackened
as customers reduced their stocks. In the UK, forward demand had also
slackened in spite of last week's report from the Confederation of British
Industry that the recovery was gathering pace.
'We are still confident that we are coming out of recession, but it is very
fragile,' Mr Lyon said. 'It is not right for us to be very bland and shelter
behind what the CBI said last week.'
Analysts said the stock market reaction to Bowater's statement was
excessive. One suggested the market was 'looking for any excuse to slap
companies.'
'When Bowater can increase underlying profits, excluding acquisitions and
disposals, by 11 per cent even in bad times, that must bode very well for
the future,' he said.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 48 per cent, from Pounds
689m to Pounds 1.02bn.
That included a Pounds 119m contribution from new acquisitions, including
Speciality Coatings International, acquired in March for Dollars 434m
(Pounds 287m), Tower Packaging, acquired in May for Dollars 105m, and the
remaining 44 per cent shareholding in MiTek, acquired in January for Dollars
55m.
While ongoing businesses increased operating profits by 11 per cent, the
acquisitions made Pounds 13.1m, and there was a further gain of Pounds 4m
from foreign exchange movements.
Group operating margins increased from 8.7 per cent to 8.8 per cent, with
the margin in the new acquisitions a better-than-expected 11 per cent.
The interim dividend is lifted 13 per cent to 5.3p. Earnings increased to
12.3p (11p).
Gearing fell from 56 per cent to 48 per cent.
Mr Lyon said the group was unlikely to make any further large-scale
acquisitions as it was concentrating on integrating and developing the most
recent ones.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food incurs seasonal loss of
Pounds 376,000 but confident on full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE FOOD Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated in March,
yesterday announced first-half pre-tax losses of Pounds 376,000 on sales of
Pounds 29.5m.
However, Mr Mike Firth, chairman, chief executive and founder, pointed to
the highly seasonal nature of the business, which is concentrated in the
dried fruit and nut sector. Last year only 35 per cent of sales were made in
the first half, with the bulk coming in the run up to Christmas.
'Losses in our business are quite typical in the first half,' he said. 'We
are confident about our position for the full year.'
No profits forecast was made at the time of flotation, but Panmure Gordon,
which sponsored the placing, is forecasting full year profits of Pounds
5.3m.
The group, which this month completed the acquisition of 80 per cent of the
dried fruit business of Del Monte, is also planning to dispose of its UK
bakery division, which incurred losses before interest of Pounds 324,000 on
turnover of Pounds 848,000.
The latest deficit followed a loss of Pounds 615,000 on sales of Pounds
22.5m in the 1992 first half. For the full year pre-tax profits were Pounds
2.72m on sales of Pounds 63.2m.
Operating profits were Pounds 86,000 for the first half. Mr Firth said this
figure had been distorted by a first half loss from Treehouse Farms, the US
almond producer acquired last year, which achieves 70 per cent of its sales
in the second half.
While turnover of the US ingredients operations was up from Pounds 2.2m to
Pounds 8m, the business dipped from operating profits of Pounds 17,000 to
losses of Pounds 88,000.
In the UK, the dried fruit and nuts sector increased operating profits from
continuing operations from Pounds 423,000 to Pounds 505,000.
The small beverages division, which roasts, grinds and distributes coffee,
made an operating loss of Pounds 7,000, compared with a Pounds 54,000
profit, reflecting investment in a new factory, warehouse and computer
system.
This increased overheads by about Pounds 300,000, but benefits would be
reflected in the second half, the group said.
Losses per share were 2.19p. An interim dividend of 0.72p is declared.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing package for Bredero's Centre
West project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRE WEST, the ambitious Hammersmith office and retail development which
pushed Bredero Properties deeply into the red last year, has been refinanced
with Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel Bank becoming the sole lender.
The project, began late in the construction boom because of long planning
delays, will be held by a ring-fenced Bredero subsidiary, Bredero Centre
West .
Bredero has been released from all financial liabilities to BCW which will
continue to manage completion of Centre West. BCW has 'a very limited
prospect of residual profit after satisfying all its obligations to Hypo,'
Bredero said.
Bredero, 49 per cent-owned by Slough Estates, is also prohibited from paying
any dividend to ordinary or preference shareholders until the end of
September next year.
Last month it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 106.4m for 1992 and net
liabilities of Pounds 24.6m.
The group said yesterday that the restructured bank facilities would make 'a
significant improvement to the financial position'. Restating the 1992
balance sheet on a pro forma basis showed the group with net assets of
Pounds 4.8m.
Bredero would now concentrate on its interests in the Paisley Centre, the
Ashley Centre and the Hart Centre, and in the development sites at Centre
West phase 2 and the Buchanan Centre, Glasgow.
Hypobank is providing a new Pounds 70m loan facility to Centre West. The
bank acquired Pounds 74.7m of debt from the outgoing syndicate of 12 banks
for a consideration of Pounds 16.3m. As part of the refinancing, BCW's debt
has been written down by Pounds 58.4m. The bank said yesterday that it had
faith in the project, which was on time for its scheduled completion next
spring and was coming in under cost.

FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Grafton falls to IPounds 1.21m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Grafton Group, the Dublin-based builders' merchant and DIY
concern, fell from IPounds 1.85m to Pounds IPounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.13m) for
the half year ended June 30.
Turnover was static at IPounds 48.6m but interest charges were reduced from
IPounds 698,000 to Pounds 480,000 because of a lower level of debt and
transactions in financial markets, the directors explained.
Although earnings per share fell to 5.6p (8.6p) the interim dividend is
lifted from 2.75p to 3p.
Directors said an improving trend in profitability evident in the second
quarter had continued in July and August.
They added that there was 'evidence of some recovery' in the Irish and UK
housing markets which would benefit the merchanting and manufacturing
businesses.
A continuing improvement in trading on the DIY side was also expected.

Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer, has made its
first acquisition since coming to the market in February with a Pounds 27.7m
tag.
At the time Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, expressed the hope that
the company could expand from its existing 180 outlets to 300 within the
next two years.
It is buying Mr Motor, an eight branch chain of accessory shops in
Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, for an undisclosed sum.
The company had sales of Pounds 1.5m last year.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Spectacle lens side sold by Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, has agreed the sale of its Sola spectacle lens
business for Dollars 315m (Pounds 210m). After costs relating to the sale,
Pilkington will receive Pounds 200m in cash.
Its shares rose 7p to 163p.
The purchaser is AEA Investors, a fund set up several years ago by a group
of wealthy US individuals to buy companies. Sola, which is based in
California, is one of two global companies in the spectacle lens market.
Mr Andrew Robb, Pilkington's finance director, said the sale should cut
gearing by about 20 percentage points to 70 per cent. This would be achieved
by a combination of a Pounds 56m addition to reserves, as the sale is above
book value, and the reduction in debt.
Gearing had risen through the Pounds 95m purchase of the Heywood Williams
glass distribution business in April and the agreed acquisition of a half
share in Siv, the Italian glass company, for Pounds 45m.
The profit and loss account will include the Pounds 56m gain, offset by
Pounds 18m of goodwill written off when Sola was acquired 15 years ago.
Mr Robb said the effect of the sale on on-going pre-tax profits would be
negative since the interest saving on the cash would not match profits from
Sola, which were Pounds 19.1m at the operating level and Pounds 15.7m
pre-tax in the year to March 31 on sales of Pounds 186m.
However, at the earnings level the sale would make little difference, he
said, since Sola's profits were taxable, but the interest saving would be
made in the US and UK where Pilkington paid no tax.
Sola was put on the market last December, and Mr Robb said that Goldman
Sachs had found a number of buyers. This had delayed the sale as the
different potential purchasers had each had to do due diligence
investigations.
Mr Robb said the AEA offer was the best. It was still contingent on AEA
raising some debt finance for the purchase. Completion is expected by
November.
Analysts welcomed the deal, but in the words of one 'it is one step down a
long road'. He said further disposals were essential.
Mr Robb acknowledged the group was looking at making other sales. He would
not be specific about which businesses might be sold but said the group
would not contemplate sales of its core flat and safety glass activities.
Further disposals would help achieve the target of cutting gearing by
another 20 percentage points over the next two years, he added.
Analysts expect the US contact lens business to be sold once its profits
have recovered, and believe Pilkington could sell a half share in its
Australian subsidiary.
AEA keeps a low profile. In February it sold Speciality Coatings
International to Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, for
Pounds 305m having bought it from James River in 1991.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Trencherwood moves back into the black
after exceptionals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFECTS of an exceptional credit together with the sale proceeds of a
subsidiary enabled USM-quoted Trencherwood, the Newbury-based housebuilder,
to move Pounds 1.82m back into the black at the pre-tax level for the half
year ended April 30.
These credits, totalling Pounds 3.45m, related primarily to adjustments
resulting from the refinancing of the company approved by shareholders in
February.
The pre-tax profit, which compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 16.4m,
also reflected a Pounds 2m reduction in interest costs to Pounds 1.22m.
Turnover for the half year totalled Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 9.63m). However,
since January the company had seen a marked improvement in purchaser
confidence which in turn had fed through to increased sales.
The directors were 'encouraged' by the way the housing market had recovered
in west Berkshire and noted that so far, the recovery had been sustained.
They added that Trencherwood remained on course to achieve a return to
profitability during 1994.
In April, planning consent was granted for the construction of a food
superstore for J Sainsbury on land principally owned and controlled by an
associate company. It was pointed out that the sale of the land should make
a significant contribution to cash flow this year.
Borrowings at the period end amounted to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 48.2m).
Undiluted earnings per share emerged at 3.74p against losses of 65.6p.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance recovers and plans share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 61.7m for the first six months of 1993 and announced plans to raise
capital to take advantage of improved trading conditions.
The figures, which compared with a previous loss of Pounds 97.9m, reflected
rises in premium rates, falling claims in some lines and cuts in costs.
Plans to raise up to Pounds 300m by way of a new preference share issue will
allow the group to take advantage of 'attractive opportunities' in the UK
market when these arise, as well as continuing the repair work to the
group's balance sheet following heavy losses in the last three years.
In spite of the improvement in the results the market was unimpressed and
the shares closed 20p down at 367p.
Analysts suggested that a less than expected rise in net asset value to
Pounds 1.56m - compared with Pounds 1.55bn at December 31 - depressed
sentiment. Despite increases in the value of equity holdings, goodwill
write-offs, including those related to the acquisition of Hafnia, the Danish
insurer, and the purchase of remaining minorities in Swinton, the insurance
broker, held back growth in net assets.
Earnings per share amounted to 5.2p (losses of 14.1p). The interim dividend
is maintained at 5.25p.
Mr Roger Neville, group chief executive, said the profits reflected a
'substantial improvement in all major operations including insurance profits
in UK personal business and overseas and a significant increase in life
profits'.
Losses on UK domestic mortgage indemnity business have fallen to Pounds 60m
from Pounds 108m in the first half of 1992, but like its UK rivals, the
company has benefited from a rise in premium rates and a fall-off in claims
in some lines.
Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 153.1m (Pounds 280.8). The improvement
was heavily concentrated in the UK where losses fell from Pounds 244.7m to
Pounds 100.6m, despite net losses of Pounds 25m from the Bishopsgate bomb in
April.
Life profits increased substantially from Pounds 27.3m to Pounds 38.3m.
Income from new annual premiums in the UK expanded by 6 per cent. Investment
and other income rose to Pounds 176.5m (Pounds 155.6m). Premium income from
general business increased to Pounds 1.73bn (Pounds 1.46bn), but income from
life insurance fell to Pounds 509m (Pounds 627.9m).

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Stein dismounts but remains in training -
Michael Skapinker considers how the changes at the top of Ladbroke will work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Cyril Stein, who is to step down as chairman of Ladbroke after 37 years,
spent yesterday in bed with a temperature.
The fever prevented him from appearing in public to talk about the interim
results, announced yesterday, or to recount how he turned what was once a
bookmaker to the aristocracy into a group with a market capitalisation of
more than Pounds 2bn and interests including the Hilton International hotel
chain, betting shops, property and DIY stores.
Having to give interviews over the telephone from his sick bed has clearly
not dimmed his sense of humour.
Nor has it lessened his determination to continue playing a leading role at
Ladbroke even after the end of the year, when he officially steps down.
Did he regard yesterday as a momentous occasion?
'Yes,' he chuckled. 'The property division made a profit.'
The group announced that Mr John Jackson, at present non-executive vice
chairman, is to become non-executive chairman. Mr Peter George, vice
chairman and joint managing director, will take over as chief executive.
Mr Stein will remain a non-executive director for three years and act as
non-executive chairman of the property division.
Mr Jackson and Mr George, interviewed at the London Hilton on Park Lane,
seemed quite clear about what the change would mean.
Mr Jackson stressed that Ladbroke would now be led by a team rather than a
charismatic individual.
Mr Stein made it apparent that Ladbroke would benefit from his charisma and
experience for at least the next three years.
Mr Jackson said: 'Cyril Stein is a very powerful personality. It's almost
certainly a mistake to secure the succession of such a person by finding a
clone. The way to provide for the succession is with a highly-motivated,
well-trained team. Peter will be very much the leader of a powerful team.'
Mr Jackson added that Mr Stein's continuing presence would not cause his
successors problems. 'It was a matter of discussion between Cyril Stein and
myself. Cyril is a very moral person. Under no circumstances would he create
difficulties.'
Mr Stein said yesterday that the change meant he would no longer have the
final say on group policy. 'I will have my word, but not the final word.' He
stressed, however, that he would be the more active sort of non-executive
director.
He has, he said, always been a hands-on leader. 'I still go around the
hotels emptying ashtrays. That's at Forte hotels. At our hotels the ashtrays
are always clean.' As a non-executive, he would be in the office five days a
week.
He would receive the same weekly report papers he gets now. 'I will have no
hesitation talking to the divisions or the heads of divisions,' he said.
'A non-executive has the same power as an executive director. I will talk to
Peter. I will talk to John. We've worked for some time as a troika. To a
large extent that's the way it will go on.'
Why retire as chairman, in that case?
'I'm 65. I think every company should open the windows and let some fresh
air in from time to time. I planned this two years ago when I made Peter
George joint managing director.
'I'm going to serve another three years, but it does give encouragement to
people down the line. When I phoned the 36-year old who runs our US property
division, he said: 'One down, 11 to go.''
Mr Stein's reluctance to make a clean break could be seen as understandable
for two reasons. The first is that Ladbroke, as it exists today, is largely
his creation.
Originally founded more than 100 years ago in the village of Ladbroke,
Warwickshire, the company began by taking bets on horse races from a select
group of customers. Only those who had personal entries in Debrett's were
accepted.
In 1956, Ladbroke was acquired by a consortium, Beaver Holdings, and Mr
Stein became managing director.
In those days, the company used to make profits of between Pounds 60,000 and
Pounds 70,000 a year, Mr Stein recalled. 'If the favourite won the Derby,
we'd lose a year.'
The legalisation of off-track betting in 1963 provided Ladbroke with the
opportunity to extend its reach beyond the confines of high society.
In 1966, Mr Stein became chairman, floating the company a year later with an
initial market capitalisation of a little less than Pounds 1m.
In the 1970s, Ladbroke's expanded into property and hotels. It also went
into casinos, which provided Mr Stein with the worst setback of his career.
In 1979, Ladbroke lost three of its casino licences after allegations about
the way it had attempted to win business from rivals. The judge who heard
the case in Knightsbridge Crown Court described the way the casinos were run
as 'disgraceful'.
Many predicted Mr Stein would not survive. He did, but he yesterday
described the affair as his lowest point.
'That was a very disappointing year,' he said. 'The problem was the jealousy
of other people who took certain steps to make sure we would lose our
licences, such as people being planted in our business.'
The high point, he said, was the purchase of Hilton International in 1987,
which provided the group with one of the world's best-known brand names.
The second reason for Mr Stein's continued interest is that an end to the
recession could lift Ladbroke's results, defying those critics who have
complained of drift and lack of focus in recent years.
Mr George, who joined Ladbroke at the age of 19 after a brief stint working
for his bookmaker father, agrees that much of the difficult cost-cutting has
already been done.
Problems remain, however. The DIY business is experiencing fierce price
competition and Mr George concedes that the sector's customer service needs
improving. While hotels in the UK are experiencing an upturn, conditions in
many countries remain sluggish.
Mr George said yesterday he had not really thought about what his management
style was. On reflection he offered 'honest, straightforward, direct and
fair'. He added that he did not like surprises.
To someone who has spent his entire adult life at Ladbroke, the dominating
personality of a still-present Mr Stein cannot be regarded as a surprise.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Vickers back on the right road with profits
of Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICKERS, the UK engineering group, ended two years of losses by achieving a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m in the first six months following a deficit of
Pounds 4.1m in the same period last year.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the
luxury cars operation, was 'on track to break even' in the full year after
suffering total losses in the last two years of Pounds 110m, including
trading losses and restructuring costs.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.5p to 1.25p. Last year's total was cut
to only 1.5p from the peak of 9.9p paid in 1990.
Group turnover in the half year to end-June fell by 5.4 per cent to Pounds
330.5m (Pounds 349.3m).
Vickers was 'back on the path towards gradual earnings growth,' said Sir
Colin. Trading conditions had shown 'little sign of improvement' but the
group was benefiting from the 'significant' cuts in its cost base and the
strengthening of operational management.
Vickers said that sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars were unchanged in
the first six months at 693, ending the dramatic decline of the previous two
years when sales worldwide plunged to only 1,378 in 1992 from the peak of
3,333 in 1990.
Sir Colin said that in the long term, the luxury cars business would need to
find some form of partnership in order to develop a new model generation.
The Cosworth engines subsidiary has suffered from a sharp fall in demand for
road engines from Ford, which has fallen to about 3,000 this year from 9,000
two years ago.
The decline has been offset by the growth of the motorsport business,
however, with successes in both Formula 1 and the IndyCars series in North
America.
Vickers had still not received 'a firm response' from the UK government in
its negotiations over a Pounds 500m contract either to supply more
Challenger 2 tanks or to upgrade the British Army's existing Challenger 1
tanks, said Sir Colin.
COMMENT
Vickers is clearly back on the right road, but the route to recovery still
involves considerable uncertainties. March's Pounds 60.5m rights issue has
cut gearing to 6 per cent, but individual businesses such as marine and
aviation face tough markets conditions. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars should break
even, but a welcome increase of sales in markets such as China and the
former Soviet Union may prove unreliable. The big Challenger contract could
also fall foul of a public expenditure squeeze. Forecast profits of about
Pounds 32m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 21. The shares, up 5
1/2 p to 160p yesterday, have risen strongly since the rights issue, which
was priced at 95p, and now look fully valued.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis and Japanese group in Dollars
17.5m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Chrysalis Group rose by 37p to 116p after Fujisankei, the Japanese
media company, agreed to buy more than a quarter of the UK media company's
new record division for Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.5m), valuing the Echo Label
at more than the market value of the whole group.
Pony Canyon, Fujisankei's music division, will pay three installments over
two years for a 25.1 per cent stake. Echo, formally launched in July, was
planned following the lapse of a 12-month no-competition clause attached to
Chrysalis' sale of its old record label to Thorn EMI.
Mr Chris Wright, chairman, said: 'We've now got a very strong partner who is
in the business and prepared to spend the necessary resources.'
Echo has not yet signed any artistes and Chrysalis said yesterday the money
raised from the equity sale would fund the label during its initial
development phase.
Chrysalis will subscribe for the remaining shares and the two shareholders
will each make available an interest-bearing loan facility of Dollars 2.5m
to fund the development of interactive music product.
Chrysalis' shares in Echo will be held by an intermediate holding company,
Armourvale, which will be 75 per cent owned by Chrysalis and 25 per cent
owned by Mr Steve Lewis, the managing director and chief executive of
Chrysalis' music division.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cookson 40% rise aided by exchange rate
movements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOKSON GROUP, the specialist industrial materials company, yesterday
reported a 40 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, helped by exchange
rate movements and gains on disposals.
However, the results disappointed the market and Cookson's shares lost 11p
to close at 220p. One analyst blamed the share price decline on 'unrealistic
expectations egged on by management.'
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 47.2m in the six
months to June 30 on turnover which grew by nearly 17 per cent to Pounds
710.1m (Pounds 609.5m).
Earnings increased to 5.8p (4p) out of which the company is paying an
unchanged interim dividend of 3p.
Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said the continuing improvement had been
achieved despite difficult market conditions in the UK and continental
Europe which showed little sign of improvement.
Exchange rate movements added about Pounds 5m to pre-tax profits and Pounds
74m to sales compared with the 1992 period. Mr Robert Malpas, chairman, said
that at constant exchange rates sales rose by about 4 per cent and pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent. At constant exchange rates, and excluding a Pounds
5.5m gain on disposals, pre-tax profits were up 8 per cent.
Group operating profits increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds
42.7m). On a like-for-like basis, adjusted for exchange rates and a number
of other factors, including a higher Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.2m)
rationalisation charge, the underlying increase in operating profits was
about Pounds 4m or about 9 per cent.
The continuing good performance of most of the group's businesses was offset
by particular difficulties in the aluminium, lead stabiliser and pigments
businesses and in some of the development companies.
Four businesses lost Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 1.7m) and depressed the overall
operating profit return on sales to just over 7 per cent against a target of
10 per cent.
Net interest payments were little changed at Pounds 8.6m and should fall in
the second half as a result of a marked decline in borrowings which fell to
Pounds 140m at the end of June against Pounds 341m at December 31. Net
borrowings represent gearing of 21 per cent, down from 74 per cent at year
end.
COMMENT
Despite the market over-reaction to yesterday's figures - which still showed
a healthy profit gain once special factors were stripped out - Cookson is
making progress towards its strategic goals. However, there is concern that
rationalisation costs are still running at about Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m a year,
and are likely to continue, and that the handful of lossmaking businesses
are dragging margins down. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100.2m are likely
this year, equivalent to earnings per share of 12.3p meaning the shares are
trading on a prospective p/e of 18.

FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat pref holders oppose Postel plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of Greycoat preference shareholders yesterday said they would vote
against Postel's proposed rescue package after the UK's biggest pension fund
said the terms and conditions would not be improved.
In a circular to shareholders, who are being asked to approve the rescue
deal on October 8, Greycoat warns that failure to accept the agreement will
probably lead to administration.
The property company also unveiled a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 164.4m
(Pounds 7.6m) for the year to March 31. This was mainly because of a fall in
property valuations and a loss on the sale of properties. Rental income fell
from Pounds 50m to Pounds 45.4m.
Net assets per ordinary share collapsed from 201p to 33p. Shareholders funds
declined from Pounds 226.5m to Pounds 81.8m. The dividend for the year is
omitted - last year 2.3p was paid.
The company needs the support of 75 per cent of all classes of shareholders.
Some preference holders, who are being asked to waive their dividends and
take a 60 per cent cut in nominal value in exchange for a dividend and
participation in a rights issue, yesterday said they would vote against the
deal unless it was improved.
Mr John Katz, a research consultant asked by more than 25 per cent of the
preference shareholders to contact Greycoat, said: 'It is difficult to see
how any preference shareholder can accept the plan. It will have to be
improved if it is to stand a chance of success.'
Opponents include Gruss Partners, the US arbitrage house, and two banks. The
preference shares yesterday fell 6p to 41 1/2 p. The ordinary were unchanged
at 25 1/2 p.
Mr Richard Guignard, Greycoat's finance director, said: 'Nobody is happy
with this deal, which is a good sign. The pain is spread evenly. If all the
shareholders understand the consequences of what will happen if the deal is
not agreed then they will give it their support.'
Holders of the zero-coupon bonds and bank loans, who have temporarily waived
loan covenants after the company defaulted, may insist on payment of their
bonds and loans if the deal is not agreed. In such an event Greycoat warns:
'It is likely that the group would have to cease trading immediately . . .
preference and ordinary shareholders would receive no payment.'
If there was a forced sale the document says Greycoat's properties would be
worth only Pounds 366.9m.
The document also reveals that Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of
Postel, is no longer being invited to join the board of a restructured
Greycoat. If the invitation had remained he would have been deemed by the
Stock Exchange to be a proposed director and therefore responsible for the
listing particulars. To avoid this he will wait and see if the restructuring
is approved. He is expected to join the board if his rescue plan is
accepted.
The restructuring could leave Postel with 87 per cent of the shares.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Price war takes toll on Nabisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the maker of Winston and Camel cigarettes, yesterday forecast
that 1993 operating income from US tobacco operations was likely to be 43
per cent lower than last year because of the price war launched last April
by rival Philip Morris.
The company, which also makes foods, warned of depressed results for the
rest of the year, but expected improved full-year results in 1994 because of
an aggressive margin improvement programme in all its operations
The US cigarette industry has been in turmoil since Philip Morris slashed
the price of Marlboro, the top selling brand in the US, by 20 per cent to
combat a decline in market share. Other manufacturers, including RJR, were
forced to follow suit.
RJR said operating income of its US tobacco unit, before amortisation of
trademarks and goodwill, could be Dollars 900m (Pounds 596m) lower in 1993
than last year's Dollars 2.11bn. This is the first time RJR has put a firm
figure on the cost of the price war.
RJR attributed the drop in income to the general fall in tobacco sales
revenues and one-time costs involved in the price reductions.
The company said another factor behind the lower 1993 results would be a
rise in short-term interest expense. This was because it had temporarily
used the proceeds from recent senior debt offerings to reduce lower-cost
bank debt, though it eventually planned to use the proceeds to pay off
higher cost debt.
Mr Charles Harper, RJR's new chairman, said that despite the changes in the
US tobacco market, the company would generate 'good cash flows that will
enable us to continue investing in business building activities, including
acquisitions'.
Several Wall Street analysts lowered their 1993 and 1994 earnings forecasts
for RJR following the announcement, by 5 to 10 cents a share in each year,
to between 33 and 41 cents this year and 40 and 53 cents in 1994.
Two credit information agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch
Investors Service, affirmed their ratings on the group's debt.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Stein to retire from chair of Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CYRIL Stein is to retire at the end of the year after 37 years at the
head of Ladbroke Group. He was chairman for 27 years. Mr Stein, 65, will be
a non-executive director for a further three years.
Mr John Jackson, a 64-year-old non-executive director, moves from
vice-chairman to chairman. Mr Peter George, 49, vice-chairman and joint
managing director, will become chief executive of the hotels, betting,
property and do-it-yourself group.
The group yesterday announced an unchanged 4.92p interim dividend for the
half-year to June 30, despite a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.5m from
Pounds 84.4m.
Earnings per share declined to 3.98p from 4.73p. Net borrowings at the
half-year were Pounds 1.34bn, the same as in December, leaving gearing at 52
per cent.
Mr Jackson said the board would not be right to cut the dividend when it
appeared business prospects were improving.
'Things are looking a darn sight better than a year ago,' he said.
Turnover increased to Pounds 2.21bn from Pounds 1.99bn. Profit in the hotels
division slipped to Pounds 44.4m (Pounds 49.3m) on increased turnover of
Pounds 431.6m (Pounds 383.2m). Room occupancies were down in continental
Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Japan. They were up slightly in
the rest of Asia.
Mr George said the UK was a bright spot for the hotels division, with London
in particular showing a healthy improvement.
Racing profits rose to Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 36m) on turnover of Pounds
1.33bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The group expected to benefit from further
deregulation of the betting industry. Property showed a profit of Pounds
800,000 after last year's loss of Pounds 14.8m.
At Texas Homecare, profits fell to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 26.8m) on virtually
unchanged turnover of Pounds 365.4m. Mr George said margins had suffered on
large items such as kitchens, bathrooms and furniture.
He said Texas had made progress in cutting stocks and was relying more
heavily on delivering directly from suppliers to customers.
Ladbroke's share price rose 8p to 210p.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Deal set to be unveiled next week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT and Volvo, the French and Swedish vehicle groups, are aiming to
announce a full merger of their operations early next week, according to
official sources in France.
The merger would create one of the four biggest car groups in Europe and the
continent's second largest truck group. It would also prepare the combined
group for privatisation as part of the French government's campaign to sell
its stakes in 21 companies. The government currently holds 79 per cent of
Renault's shares.
The most sensitive part of the negotiations between the two companies has
been the question of the division of equity in the combined group and the
sharing of management control.
Industry observers believe that Volvo has accepted a minority stake in a
combined group, but may have the power of veto over sensitive decisions on
investments and assets. Volvo may also have a stronger role in the truck
operations.
One analyst said the division of ownership was the most thorny problem and
it could still delay the merger.
Co-operation between the groups started in 1990 when they announced an
alliance and cross-shareholdings. Progress towards full merger has
accelerated over the past months as a result of the government of Mr Edouard
Balladur seeking to ease its budget deficit and increase the independence of
French companies.
The depressed state of the European car industry has added impetus towards a
merger, which will allow economies of scale and reduced costs.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Driven by the need to survive: Kevin Done and John Ridding
on the forces behind the Renault-Volvo merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER three years of living together, Renault and Volvo are preparing to go
to the altar. The final touches are being applied this weekend to a
full-scale merger.
The deal sets a new high-water mark in the shake-out of the European motor
industry, as the continent's dwindling band of vehicle makers seek a place
among the survivors in the global industry of the next century.
Europe has become the central battle-ground of the world auto industry, as
the Japanese car makers follow their dramatic incursion into North America
during the 1980s, by building another regional production base in Europe
during the 1990s.
At the same time European car makers are under intense pressure to put their
houses in order before the expiry of the transitional period to a free car
market by the end of 1999, when all restrictions on Japanese car and light
commercial vehicle imports are supposed to be removed.
The Renault-Volvo merger moves the restructuring of the European auto
industry on to a new plane and is the first of the jumbo marriages.
Restructuring along national lines was completed long ago. The smaller
producers have nearly all been picked off: in cars, Jaguar by Ford, Saab by
General Motors, Seat and Skoda by Volkswagen and Alfa Romeo by Fiat; in
trucks, Pegaso and Ford Trucks by Iveco, Steyr by MAN, Leyland by Daf.
The new Renault-Volvo group will have a combined turnover of about Dollars
41bn. In the western European car market it will move into fourth place with
a combined share of 12.1 per cent (1992 figures) behind Volkswagen - which
includes Audi, Seat and Skoda - at 17.5 per cent, General Motors
(Opel/Vauxhall and including Saab) at 12.4 per cent and PSA Peugeot-Citroen
at 12.2 per cent. It will leap-frog both Fiat and Ford.
In cars, the impact of the merger will chiefly be felt in Europe. Renault
has long since pulled out of North America with the failure of its venture
with American Motors - it sold its stake to Chrysler in 1987. Volvo has only
0.7 per cent of the US car market.
It is a different story in the commercial vehicle industry, however, where
the merged group will challenge Mercedes-Benz for world leadership in heavy
trucks, where European producers dominate.
Volvo (through Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corporation with its WhiteGMC
brand-name), Renault (through Mack) and Mercedes-Benz (through Freightliner)
all have a substantial presence in the US market, where last year they
accounted for 44 per cent of heavy truck sales.
Volvo is much more the world player than Renault, with substantial
manufacturing operations in South America and a clear sales presence in the
Middle East and Asia.
In the European truck market, Volvo has a more significant presence than
Renault in heavy trucks, but Renault is in all market segments.
Renault-Volvo should move into second place behind Mercedes-Benz and ahead
of Iveco, part of Fiat.
The merger is being driven by an overriding imperative to force down costs.
The investment needed to develop new vehicles is such that only the biggest
battalions appear able to gain the necessary economies of scale. This week
Volvo began the launch of its new flagship heavy truck range, which has
taken seven years and an investment of SKr6.5bn (Pounds 530m) to develop.
The logic of the alliance formed in 1990 always meant that a full merger
would eventually emerge. It is the pace of the deal that has been dictated
by the ferocity of the competitive environment.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief executive, has been
determined to drive the merger through as soon as possible. 'If you stop
moving it is bad, you must keep up the momentum.' he says. 'The advantage of
a complete merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two companies
does not go as fast as managing a single group.'
As long as Renault and Volvo have different shareholders there is a basic
problem of how savings and profits - or losses - are to be apportioned
between the two companies. According to Mr Schweitzer, 'it is clear there is
no way back.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Dr Pepper plants 'poison pill'to ward off Cadbury bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and GUY DE JONQUIERES

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR PEPPER/Seven-Up, the US soft drinks group, has adopted a 'poison pill'
defence to ward off the possibility of a takeover bid from Cadbury
Schweppes, the UK soft drinks and confectionery group.
The creation of such defences has become rare as the takeover boom of the
late 1980s has waned, in part because companies fearing takeover already
have them in place. Institutional shareholders have also waged a campaign to
force companies to submit existing poison pill plans for shareholder
approval, making them less fashionable.
Dr Pepper's plan, approved by its board on Wednesday, would be triggered if
Cadbury raised its stake in the company above the 25.9 per cent of voting
and non-voting shares it already holds. All shareholders other than Cadbury
would then have the right to buy one new share at a 50 per cent discount for
every share they already owned, thus diluting the UK group's holding.
The poison pill would also come into play if another shareholder raised its
stake of voting shares above 10 per cent without the board's approval.
Dr Pepper said the plan had been adopted because of Cadbury, which added to
its 5.7 per cent holding of voting shares two weeks ago when it bought a
20.2 per cent stake of non-voting shares from Prudential Insurance. The UK
company said that it had applied on Wednesday for approval to convert its
entire holding into voting shares.
Cadbury stalked Dr Pepper in the mid-1980s, before a management buy-out took
the US company private in 1988. The company returned to the stock market
this year.
Dr Pepper said the plan 'is not intended to prevent a takeover on terms
beneficial to the company's stockholders, but rather to assure that all of
the company's stockholders are treated fairly should a takeover become
imminent'.
Cadbury said the move did not damage its own interests: 'It doesn't affect
the value of the investment we have made. Nor does it affect any plans we
have in the immediate future.'
According to the Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services, two
thirds of all companies in the S&amp;P 500 have poison pills defences. Some
companies have been forced by institutional pressure to resubmit them for
shareholder approval.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Rolls-Royce issues Pounds 307m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine manufacturer, yesterday launched its first cash
call since it was privatised five years ago with a 1-for-4 rights issue to
raise Pounds 307m.
The money is to be used to fund investment, mainly on the Trent engine, and
the cost of reducing its workforce. It will also eliminate borrowings.
The new shares are being offered at 130p each. The existing shares fell 11p
to 152 1/2 p. Rolls-Royce also unveiled its half-year results to June 30,
showing a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20m to Pounds
31m. Operating profits rose to Pounds 156m (Pounds 150m) on increased sales
of Pounds 1.7bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said the order book, at Pounds 6.4bn, had proved
strong but warned that the outlook was still fragile.
The restructuring programme, announced in March, is ahead of plan, and the
workforce has been cut by 2,900 to 48,900. There is no exceptional charge as
Pounds 180m was provided for the restructuring last year, of which Pounds
41m was used in the first half. There are unlikely to be any more provisions
taken.
Sir Ralph said: 'We would not flinch from further reductions in the
workforce if the market required it. But we do not see the need for any
further losses other than those already announced.'
The restructuring programme and late payment of bills are responsible for a
net cash outflow from operating activities of Pounds 115m compared to a cash
inflow of Pounds 45m.
Industrial and aerospace's profits before interest and after exceptional
charges rose to Pounds 35m (Pounds 28m) and Pounds 5 (Pounds 2m)
respectively.
Sir Ralph said the military operations remained profitable 'but were not
contributing in the way they had in the past'. Military engine deliveries
are not expected to pick up until 1996.
The company has asked the Department of Trade and Industry to raise the
maximum level of foreign ownership which stands at 29.5 per cent. It was
recently forced to ask foreign investors to sell their holding in the
company after the permitted level was breached.
Earnings per share rose to 2.27p (0.93p), although before exceptional items
last year's earnings were 2.39p. The interim dividend is cut by 0.55p to 2p.
The company forecasts an unchanged total of 5p.

FT  03 SEP 93 / There's no place like the virtual reality office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRTUAL REALITY technology is being applied to solve the problem of making
people who work from home feel more closely in touch with their office.
The government-funded Pounds 3m Virtuosi project, to be launched next month,
will develop sophisticated computer displays to give remote workers the
illusion that they are in the office, working alongside other homeworkers
and interacting as if they are face-to-face.
The three-year project will be headed by BT and supported by the Department
of Trade and Industry, Science and Engineering Research Council, GEC and
Division, a specialist virtual reality company run by Mr Ian Barron,
inventor of the Transputer, the original computer on a chip.
The programme - believed to be the first systematic effort to apply virtual
reality to a business environment - could spell the beginning of the end for
expensive corporate headquarters, according to Mr Alastair Rogers, a
researcher with the project at BT's Martlesham Laboratories in Suffolk.
'Virtual reality offers the most intimate and direct method of interacting
with a computer, and hence with the users of other computers,' Mr Rogers
said.
Computer networks already allow people at different sites to work together
but they severely limit human interactions. For example, it is not possible
to have unconstrained conversations or to read between the lines by looking
at facial expressions or body language.
Staff who work remotely often become disenchanted because they feel socially
deprived and isolated. BT's recent experiments in Scotland have resulted in
home-working directory inquiry operators being equipped with videophones,
not directly to support their work but to reduce their sense of isolation.
Users sitting at a virtual reality screen will see themselves in an office
with colleagues. They will be able to move themselves around the virtual
space, to interact and talk to people.
The input device could be a simple as a mouse or it could be 'data suit' - a
futuristic style of overall which picks up the user's movements and conveys
the subtleties of body language and facial expression to colleagues.
With an advanced virtual reality system, the corporation could cease to
exist as a physical entity. Employees could work entirely from home,
conducting business in a corporate virtual environment.

FT  03 SEP 93 / LBC set to lose radio franchises: Commercial services face
biggest shake-up in 20 years since launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Broadcasting Company appeared set last night to lose both its
commercial radio franchises covering the London area.
The disappearance of the two London-wide speech-based services will be the
biggest shake-up of commercial radio since its launch in the UK 20 years
ago.
London News Radio, a consortium put together by merchant bank Guinness
Mahon, was being tipped as the likely winner of LBC's frequencies.
The expected announcement by the Radio Authority at 10am today will come as
a serious blow to LBC's chairman, Dame Shirley Porter, the controversial
former leader of Westminster city council, whose family interests injected
fresh capital into the radio station.
The case for licence renewal of LBC's popular Newstalk and Talkback radio
services may have been damaged by the collapse earlier this year of its
parent, Crown Communications. LBC survived after the cash injection.
The station was also hit by the departure of its general manager, Mr Charlie
Cox, just before its franchise application was submitted earlier in the
summer. About 120 people are employed by LBC at its Hammersmith
head-quarters.
The readvertising of the London licences is part of a two-year programme by
the Radio Authority which began earlier this year. So far no incumbent has
lost.
In addition to London News Radio, LBC also faced a strong rival bid from a
consortium which included Independent Television News and Associated
Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and the London Evening Standard.
Fears of creating a London news monopoly may have counted against this
consortium.
The Radio Authority, chaired by Lord Chalfont, chose eight new radio
licences for London yesterday out of 48 applicants - four FM and four AM.
All the winners will be announced today. Six applicants were re-applying for
their existing franchises.
The apparent LBC loss would suggest that the holders of the other FM
licences, Melody Radio, Jazz FM and Kiss FM, may have retained their
licences.
Hot favourites in the industry last night for the two new AM licences were a
sports station and a country music station as part of the Radio Authority's
policy of extending listener choice in commercial radio.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Drug stocks surge as Clinton rules out mandatory price curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in drug and medical services companies rose sharply on Wall Street
and in Europe yesterday after reports, later confirmed, that President Bill
Clinton would not impose mandatory price controls on the health industry as
part of his healthcare system reforms.
Some analysts had feared that the Clinton administration would impose
short-term price controls to prevent drug companies profiteering during the
phasing in of the reforms, a process that is not expected to be completed
until 1998. The reforms are due to be unveiled later this month.
Later yesterday, Mr Clinton confirmed that he would not seek even temporary
price controls and would instead urge drug companies to restrain price
increases voluntarily. 'I've never embraced them,' he said. 'I've never been
particularly hot on price controls.'
Merck closed in New York up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 33 1/8 ,
Schering-Plough up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 63 and US Healthcare up Dollars
2 7/8 at Dollars 47 1/8 . In London, Glaxo, Zeneca, Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham all advanced in London, a pattern repeated in Zurich pharmaceutical
stocks.
The White House also confirmed that it intended to move rapidly to extend
health insurance to the whole population. It said the reformed healthcare
system would be operating in some states by 1995. There would be a firm
deadline of December 1997 for other states to join the new system. At
present, about 37m Americans lack health insurance.
Officials also confirmed that the extension of health insurance would be
financed mainly by limiting the rate of growth of existing federal
healthcare programmes. There would be an increase in 'sin' taxes, for
example on cigarettes, but no significant increase in the overall tax
burden. This reflects opposition to higher income taxes in the budget signed
last month.
Mr Clinton is also expected to propose a limit on the annual rate of
increase of private health insurance premiums. This would indirectly limit
the ability of drug companies, hospitals and physicians to raise prices
because purchasers of care would be subject to tighter budget constraints.
The main innovation is a shift to a form of 'managed competition'. The White
House will propose that most people buy health insurance through large
purchasing co-operatives known as 'regional health alliances'.

FT  03 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With insurance shares trading at a handsome premium to net asset value, woe
betide the company which does not deliver growth in shareholders' funds.
While the underwriting recovery at Sun Alliance during the first half is in
line with the competition, investment gains were washed away by goodwill
write-offs and declining property values overseas. For those who regard Sun
as a geared play on rising UK equities, that is especially disappointing.
The 5 per cent fall in the shares reflects as much.
With its balance sheet strengthened by investment gains since the half year,
and the promised preference share issue to come, Sun will doubtless maintain
its heavy weighting in UK equities and property. Its following should thus
be undiminished despite yesterday's setback, at least among investors who
believe a new era of asset price inflation is around the corner. For those
less bearish on inflation, though, the question is whether investment gains
will be frittered away by mistakes on the insurance side.
The acquisition of Denmark's Hafnia, which gave raise to half the goodwill
write-off, looks safe enough. The investment should show a decent return if
promised rate increases and cost savings come through. Being forced to buy
out the minority from Swinton at a price agreed two years ago is more of an
embarrassment, especially since the high street insurance broker is now
trading at a loss. It will take firm action to avoid a mishap on a par with
insurers' attempts to buy distribution through estate agents.

FT  03 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In marking Bowater's shares down by 4 per cent, the market revealed
extraordinarily suspicion of yesterday's cautious trading statement. The
chances are that it simply reflects straightforward reporting by its
scrupulously correct management. If the softer markets to which it referred
reflect a blip in US confidence and destocking in the European cosmetics
industry, the statement has little negative bearing on the future trend. If
the situation is more serious, Bowater is in a strong position to cope.
Rights issues have raised Pounds 857m for Bowater since 1987. But the money
has been spent on acquisitions which have moved it decisively into the
higher value-added end of packaging, while leaving gearing of less than 50
per cent. Group operating margins have increased by five points to 8.8 per
cent since 1987 despite the recession.
If the economic recovery were to falter, Bowater should regain its appeal as
a defensive stock. If it continues, its operational gearing alone should
secure decent profits growth. A lingering uncertainty is UK policy on waste
recycling, though any new legislation is less likely to affect growth areas
such as medical packaging. The tissue business also sits badly in the new
Bowater, but cannot be sold without its former US partner, Scott, having
first refusal. Given Scott's stretched balance sheet, a disposal may be some
time coming. Bowater can afford to wait.

FT  03 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Rolls-Royce made great play of its strong balance sheet when it cut
its dividend in March, it is perhaps a little surprising to find the same
directors announcing a rights issue six months later. In part, it can be
explained by the fact that Rolls' balance sheet, while perfectly formed, is
small. The more sinister explanation, however, is that cash is flowing out
of the company at a worryingly high rate, as the business is rationalised,
customers defer orders and stage payments, and working capital and stocks
rise.
While the company insists that the situation is under control, raising
Pounds 307m certainly buys a fair amount of insurance. The pain of the
downturn is thus being felt by shareholders. That might feel a little more
palatable if investors had enjoyed the full fruits of the upturn. Yet Rolls
used that opportunity to build market share on very thin margins - a
strategy which has yet to yield higher margin follow-on or spares business.
The capital expenditure programme to update and expand the range of engines
continues to prove expensive. Rolls may have little choice if it is to
remain competitive. However reassuring its order book, the business is
balanced on a thin base when compared to giants such as General Electric.
Yet that places investors in a difficult position. Rolls' shares have
struggled to rise above the issue price for most of the time since
flotation. Yesterday's action is unlikely to change that.

FT  03 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Doing it the Stein way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A generation at the head of a public company must leave an indelible
impression on both the chairman and the chair. Mr Cyril Stein, who is to
retire as Ladbroke's chairman at the end of the year, has worked a
near-miracle in building the company from a small bookmaker into a FT-SE 100
company. The question now, however, is whether Mr Stein really has the
self-discipline to let go, and whether the management team, which bears his
mark, can take up the challenge.
If Mr Stein does fade into the background - despite his non-executive
directorship, a continuing role in the property division and promise to be a
feature of head office life - the way is open for change. Most obviously,
Ladbroke can take the opportunity to cut the final dividend in March,
stemming its cash outflow and putting the payout back into line with the
prospects for the business. The current yield on the shares implies that few
believe the dividend is sustainable: a cut would probably be seen as a
welcome return to reality.
Given its head, the management might also be tempted to clear out any
remaining problem areas. That would smooth the way for a rights issue next
summer, easing the strain on the balance sheet. However much that means
shareholders paying for previous management overambition, it would allow the
company to focus on its businesses instead of its finances. Ladbroke's
markets will remain tough. DIY competition will continue to intensify,
property will remain sticky in all but prime sites, hotels will continue to
demand capital investment, and racing faces a threat from the national
lottery. The worry, however, is that Mr Stein's influence may prevent the
necessary action.
