FT  25 AUG 93 / Sound money man: Michael Portillo talks to Peter Norman
about tough choices on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months ago, Mr Michael Portillo, the youthful chief secretary to the
Treasury, made an uncharacteristic error of judgment.
The issue of Britain's public finances, he opined, did not get the kind of
public attention that it should enjoy. It was 'too technical and arcane to
evoke consistent interest from media or the public'.
Since making that remark in a speech to the annual dinner of the Association
of Investment Trust Companies, the state of UK's public finances has hardly
been out of the headlines. Not a day goes by without some reference to the
Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement expected by the government
for the current financial year or its implications for the government's
first unified Budget on November 30.
The Tory party, hardly pausing for breath after the conclusion of the
bruising Maastricht debate, is displaying new divisions over the prospect of
painful spending cuts and possible additional tax increases next year.
Since returning from holiday at the beginning of last week, Mr Portillo, 40,
who is currently deputising at the Treasury for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, has seemed in perpetual motion from radio car to television
studio to discuss the public finances.
Yesterday, looking bronzed and relaxed, he put his views to the Financial
Times.
The government had two tasks to achieve. The public finances had to be put
onto a sound basis, which meant reducing the borrowing requirement. Indeed,
'it is essential for the Conservative government to go into the next
election with a reputation for sound public finance and in a position where
it can explain that it has the public finances in a state where it can
plausibly show the path to a low tax economy'.
The second task, he said, was to make sure that the amount of national
income which is taken by the state was reduced.
'We are committed to that in the manifesto,' he said. 'In other words the
proportion within gross domestic product represented by public spending must
be cut. And even if we had a balanced budget today I would be looking to
reduce the proportion of GDP spent by government because I believe that the
state is too big, people are looking to the state to do too much, and the
proportion of our GDP spent by the government imposes too great a burden on
the wealth-creating sector.'
But, in remarks clearly addressed to the Tory right, anyone thinking that
this could be achieved easily by cutting public spending was living an
illusion.
Mr Portillo insisted that the discussions on public spending being conducted
by senior cabinet ministers in the so-called EDX committee were going well.
But the government's public spending goals, expressed in terms of its
so-called control total, of Pounds 254bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263bn in
1995-6 were 'very tough indeed'.
The control totals, which exclude part but not all of the rises and falls in
public spending caused by vagaries in the business cycle, were coming under
pressure. 'Our present plans would indicate no real-terms increase in the
control total between this year and next year, and next year and the year
after,' and yet certain programmes within the totals were rising faster than
inflation.
These included social security, where non-cyclical payments are rising in
real terms by about 3 per cent a year, health, education, legal aid and
payments to the European Community's common agricultural policy. The
government was therefore faced with two difficult tasks.
'One is to constrain the rate of growth of those demand-led programmes, and
the other is to find offsetting savings in other programmes.'
The problems of rising social security spending are the subject of one of a
series of reviews by the Treasury that are expected to set guidelines for
reducing the size of state activity over the medium and longer term. But
this process was also informing the options available to the government this
year.
Mr Portillo said he 'could imagine the state disengaging or reducing its
commitments to programmes in the short term'. It was no secret that it was
studying the rapid growth in payments of invalidity benefit to assess
whether it was going to the right people.
But 'the rate at which you can alter trends in public spending is severely
conditioned by the need to alter commitments and therefore to pass
legislation'.
For that reason the government had to look beyond spending at the rate of
economic recovery and the possibility of raising more revenue when judging
how it should cut borrowing.
'If we were not now to bring down our rate of borrowing by use of all three
means as necessary, we would establish permanently higher rates of
borrowing, permanently higher rates of interest burden to be funded and
therefore permanently higher rates of taxation.'
With the Budget more than three months away and the next financial year over
seven months distant, Mr Portillo was careful yesterday to keep open the
government's options on future tax increases.
But he held out some hope that the Tory party might not succumb totally to
internal strife on the issue.
'I won't deny that there is a debate in the Conservative party. But I think
it is considerably less sharp than the one we had in the '80s between wets
and dries. All the people debating in the Conservative party are agreed
about the need to constrain public spending and the need to have sound
public finances. There is a lobbying and jostling around the balance between
public spending restraint and taxation increase, and indeed were there to be
taxation increases, lobbying about what sort of taxes they ought to be. That
seems to me just the normal political interplay.'

FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Price theory cannot apply to
environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN PLOWDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader describes as 'absurd' the resistance of many
non-conformists to the notion that everything - including rainforests and
whales - has a price ('Valuing the environment', August 19).
What is equally absurd is the conviction of economists that everything does
have a price, even if it is only a price estimated (by economists) using one
of a number of valuation techniques. The logical outcome of this position is
that the last whale should be killed or the last acre of open countryside
paved over if the economic benefits outweigh both economic and (fully
internalised) environmental costs.
Even if the shortcomings of present modes of economics can be overcome,
which is questionable, there remains the critical moral issue of whether the
current generation has the right to damage irreversibly the environment that
will be inherited by our descendants, even if we are willing to 'pay' for
the damage.
Daly (a World Bank economist) and Cobb argue in relation to carbon dioxide
emissions in their book, For the Common Good: 'Instead of beginning with the
impossible task of calculating full-cost prices and then letting the market
determine the right quantities on the basis of these prices, we could begin
with the 'right' quantities and let the market calculate the corresponding
prices.'
This principle applies across the board, with the 'right quantities' of
environmental costs being those that allow society to function within the
quantitative and qualitative capacity of the environment.
Defining those quantities will inevitably be fraught with uncertainty and
controversy. It may prove to be more useful and acceptable than waiting for
economists to find the 'price' of environmentally sustainable economic
activity.

<TEXT>
It is dangerously easy to forget the excellence of much of the broadcasting
in Britain. The trouble is that if, in an irritated fit of economic
stringency, we once abandon the system that brings these programme riches,
we shall not easily - if ever - retrieve it. Tonight's television schedules
are pretty unimpressive, but BBC radio provides all sorts of goodies.
Live from the Albert Hall on Radio 3 there are two BBC Proms. At 7.00 Robert
Zeigler conducts the Matrix Ensemble in a programme of the sort of
compositions which featured so interestingly in 'Second Heimat': 20th
century German music. At 10.00, with pictures on BBC1, Anthony Rooley
directs the Consort of Musicke in a selection from Monteverdi's 'Sixth Book
Of Madrigals'.
Radio 4 starts a new series of In Business with a look at the current
turmoil in shopping: the old supermarket chains under attack from price
cutters, high-tech innovation and home shopping. At 9.00 on Radio 2 Lucie
Skeaping's Early Music, taking town and country life as its theme, includes
a little number by Purcell robustly entitled 'A Pox On You For A Fop'.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Novelty concerts from Spain - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Away from the main themes of the festival there has been a delightful pair
of concerts from Spain. The Orquestra de cambra Teatre Lliure arrived in
Edinburgh without much of a fanfare and offered little biographical
information about itself except that it was founded in 1985 by the conductor
Josep Pons and performs 20th-century repertoire.
Its calling-card comprised two imaginative concerts: a pair of Spanish
programmes, one of music by Manuel de Falla, the other of Roberto Gerhard,
composers from very different artistic backgrounds. If they have one trait
in common, it is a liking for strongly-contrasted colours, as we heard quite
vividly. The Edinburgh prospectus had advertised the orchestra as
'brilliant', an epithet which did not seem excessive after the event.
The Falla concert was held in the Usher Hall, but probably should not have
been. Despite an audience turnout which justified the use of a large hall,
the chamber versions of the scores that were being played could hardly make
the impact they deserved. For one work - Falla's pithy Harpsichord Concerto
(wisely performed here in an alternative version for piano) - there were
only six players on the platform.
Given the novelty of the pieces the orchestra had brought, one really wanted
as immediate a contact with the players as possible. Two of Falla's most
popular works were on the programme, but each in a rarely-heard original
form: El corregidor y la molinera (later to spawn The Three-cornered Hat)
and the first version of El amor brujo.
The second was the eye-opener, both because it is longer than the usual
version and because its nature is so different. Originally the music
developed out of a chain of recitation, songs and dances. It was described
as a 'gitaneria', or gypsy-piece, folk music at heart in a way that one
could hardly guess at from the orchestral showpiece we usually hear. The
singer, Ginesa Ortega, gave us real Flamenco in the songs, guttural, raw,
full of passion - no concert-hall sophistication there.
For the Gerhard programme the orchestra moved to the small Queen's Hall. An
irony this, as there were now more musicians on stage than for the largest
of the Falla scores. But this was to Gerhard's advantage and even the two
very derivative Spanish works that had been included - the Flamenco
divertissement Alegrias and the song-cycle Cancionero de Pedrell based on
Spanish folksongs - came across with some bite and flair.
I suspect there is not much of the true Gerhard in either of those. A short
cycle of songs to surreal poems written in French by a Catalan poet in the
Japanese style proved to be attractive, precious, not particularly
distinctive. It was the ballet score Pandora, composed in Cambridge in
1942-3, that best showed how dramatic and evocative this composer can be,
its sense of enveloping doom typical of the war years.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Theatre at the Traverse - The Edinburgh Festival /
Alastair Macaulay finds sex, death and more hilariously camped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since it moved (less than two years ago) to its new premises the
Traverse has become a hub of Edinburgh life. Especially in Festival time.
Even if you are not going there for shows, you use its cafe (from 10 am till
midnight), you use its bar (open till early hours), you bump into old chums
there. And this year, there is also the new Atrium restaurant. The old
Traverse crowded you; this one has space.
If you go to Fringe theatre, the Traverse is on your map anyway. This year,
even the official Festival has used Traverse terrain, to present the opera
double bill Anna and Tourist Variations. But, for most of the the Festival
the Traverse is a core venue for Fringe plays. Either of its two auditoria
is currently showing four different shows per day (except on Mondays), from
12 noon until 12.30 am: plays and actors from Scotland, England, Spain,
Belgium, Canada, the States, South Africa. I report here on five Traverse
plays from the start of the Festival.
Penetrator (Traverse 2, world premiere), written and directed by Anthony
Neilson, is the best Fringe play I have seen so far in '93 (I write this on
Day 8). The worst thing I can tell you of it is that the advance blurb
describes it as 'a taut and harrowing journey into the ferocious heart of
masculinity' - though it is taut and harrowing, it is a journey into
masculinity, and it sure gets ferocious. It is also a thriller about three
young Scotsmen, two of whom are ostentatiously heterosexual and occasionally
tease the third one that he's a poof; but all is not as it seems. The title
warns you. Penetrator is about sex and threatened death. The real 'thriller'
aspect of it, during the long and terrifying knifepoint climax, is its
series of psychological revelations. Neilson is at his least canny in pacing
the final ten minutes, which seem more neat and contrived - though still
psychologically riveting. More than that I will not say, except to warn off
those who are alarmed by ten-inch knives and four-letter words; and to
praise BJ McMurphy, Alan Francis and James Cunningham for the exceptional
conviction and fluency of their playing.
The Edinburgh Festival often gives Londoners a chance to catch up with what
we missed back home; and I am grateful for the chance to catch up with the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company (Traverse 2), the New York troupe which
recently played at the Drill Hall. Brother Truckers, by Georg Osterman, is
described as 'a Comedy Noir' and 'the B-movie story of the men who haul
trash and the women who love them': which is fair enough. It too is about
sex and death - but is a hilarious exercise in intense camp.
The heroine, Lyla Balskin (Everett Quinskin), is a brilliant Barbara
Stanwyck type (with dashes of Bette Davis, Mae West, Joan Crawford and Joan
Blondell). The snake-like way she darts her tongue as she names her lover
('Lech', as in Walesa), the smouldering way she hisses out lines like 'If
you were as bright as your Clairol treatment, you'd know', and her final mad
scene are highpoints amid wonderful ensemble playing. I'm not sure, but I
think my favourite lines was 'I'm having difficulty breathing, and, with all
due respect to the House of Chanel, this dress isn't making it any easier.'
Speaking of camp, Neil Bartlett's Night after Night is playing in Traverse
1; but enough already - I covered that Upstairs at the Royal Court some
months ago. Speaking of men, the Spanish show Muu] (Traverse 1) is a largely
mime cartoon about four matadors. I laughed about six times (it is a
70-minute piece), and I object to the performers' mugging and milking each
joke dry. True, it is good to know that Spaniards are laughing about both
bullfighting and the cult of machismo. But, these days, who isn't?
Comunicado, the Scottish theatre company, is presenting its largely
non-speaking version of Flaubert's The Legend of St Julian (Traverse 1) with
just seven performers. You can tell in the first five minutes that the
director Gerry Mulgrew has a flair for poetic stage pictures, for pithy
atmospheric evocation, for real theatre magic; and, also in the first five
minutes, that he hasn't the rhythm to keep his storytelling taut - and the
show lasts 135 minutes. Flaubert's medieval tale is laconic. Mulgrew catches
some of its events with striking economy; but he draws out others, and
allows composer Jim Sutherland to overdo the misterioso sound effects.
Sleeping With You (Traverse 2) is the only one-man play the Traverse is
presenting this year. Written by Godfrey Hamilton and played by his lover
Mark Pintosh, this piece comes from Hawaii's Starving Artists Theatre
Company. Despite the fact that it is a deliberate vehicle for one person's
actorly virtuosity and a piece of socio-political agitprop (two big minuses
in my book), it is arresting, varied, intelligent, touching and funny -
standing both inside and outside its subject.
In Sleeping with You, Pintosh plays both Marco and Andrew, shows their
affair from different slants, depicts the whole sleaze scene of Hawaii gay
hustlers, speaks of gay promiscuity, of serious gay love, and of Aids. Then
he relates the big gay march on Washington DC; the organisers yelling 'I
need to tell you we only have a permit for civil disobedience in this area';
and the 'pale queers' from Wisconsin chanting 'We're tired, we're bitchy, we
want our rights now.' Any play that can suddenly make you guffaw out of the
blue after an hour, and that can laugh at the cause it preaches, has real
control.
Brother Truckers and Night after Night continue until August 29; The Legend
of St Julian until September 4

FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Scrambled Sky at a premium - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sky Television is currently urging satellite viewers to phone for details of
'A brand new Sky'. Do so and you receive a 36-page sales brochure which
declares 'Summer's here and there's a completely new look to satellite
television on the way. The Sky Multi-Channels Package will be the most
exciting thing to hit your TV screen in years. There are brand new channels
to satellite (sic) and a new way of receiving all your current favourites.
Sky Multi-Channels launch on September 1, so hurry to page 11 to read all
about it. You could also win a brand new Vauxhall . . .' This seems to be
Sky-speak meaning 'From September we shall be adding new channels to the
output. Most of the material will be American. At the same time we shall
scramble the signal on all but one of the Sky services so that we can charge
you for what you were previously watching for nothing. You could also win a
brand new Vauxhall . . .'
The minimum 'package' of 12 scrambled channels will cost Pounds 4 a month
for the remainder of this year and then Pounds 7 a month from January. That
will bring you the general entertainment channel Sky One, the Children's
Channel, the British repeat channel UK Gold, and the nine new channels
listed below. Add to that package one of the 'premium' channels (The Movie
Channel, Sky Movies Plus, or Sky Sports) and the price goes up to Pounds 12
a month. Add two premium channels and the cost is Pounds 17 a month. For all
three it is Pounds 20 a month. With the two top price packages you get Sky
Movies Gold thrown in, though it is neither a premium channel nor part of
the basic package. Thus the lowest priced Sky package will, from January
1994, cost Pounds 84 a year: Pounds 1 more than the BBC licence fee. If you
take all the Sky services it will cost Pounds 240 a year.
What about those in Britain's 2.5m satellite homes who bought their dishes
on the understanding that the cost of the hardware, currently around Pounds
200, would be all they had to pay, not realising that encryption and
subscription would follow? Since the dishes pick up all signals transmitted
via the Astra satellite (actually three satellites now in the same position,
with 48 channels already useable and more to come) there are still many
channels which are neither owned by Sky nor marketed as part of the Sky
package which can still be received in clear, though most are German or
Dutch language services. English language channels which will continue, for
the moment anyway, to be available free to those who cannot afford to pay
another Pounds 84 a year, or who simply decide to resist Sky's urgings, will
be Ted Turner's global news network CNN, Sky News (which is presumably
staying unscrambled to compete with CNN), the 24-hour rock video channel
MTV, Eurosport, and Turner's Cartoon Network which is due to arrive soon.
And what are those 'brand new channels' which Sky is offering as an
inducement to pay a subscription? There are nine: The American children's
channel Nickelodeon. A 24-hour home shopping channel called QVC ('quality,
value and convenience'). The Family Channel showing series such as Remington
Steele and Big Brother Jake. Discovery, a factual channel specialising in
wildlife, travel, 'adventure', etc. Two more all-music networks: CMT, or
Country Music Television; and VH1, or Video Hits One, which seeks to be an
adult version of MTV 'for the generation that grew up with the music'. A
women's channel called UK Living, described by Lis Howell, head of
programming, as 'the elastic waistband' station; she warns that it will be
'domestic' and 'undemanding'. Two American 'retro' channels: Nick At Night
which claims to be 'dedicated to the preservation of television's heritage';
and Bravo which promises 'treasures from the vaults'.
This appears to be the sort of 'niche programming' that we have so long been
told is the natural outcome of the multi-channel systems brought in by
satellite and cable. UK Living will presumably screen British material,
though only 2 1/2 of their 18 hours a day will be original programming, and
perhaps QVC's goods will be British, though we shall have to wait and see.
Marketing programmes currently filling spare time on some satellite channels
at night seem to sell only American products  - plastic house painting kits,
kitchen knives, car cleaners - with 'programmes' made in the US even though
the presenters are invariably British. Those services aside, it looks as
though these nine networks will consist almost exclusively of American
material, most of it old, some of it quite astonishingly so.
Few of these new - well, new to Britain - channels have even started test
transmissions yet, but Bravo and Discovery have been running in clear for a
couple of weeks, so it has been possible to get an idea of what they, at
least, have to offer. The answer is a strong whiff of nostalgia, an
overpowering sense of American cultural values, and a feeling of stringent
budgets. There is some British material here: on Discovery I have seen
Bellamy's Bird's Eye View and several Loch Ness Updates covering a
scientific hunt for a monster. There was even a European programme on
Saturday evening, a 60-minute production called Airbus, about the building
of the aeroplane, but as this droned on - 'Here's the comfortable
six-abreast business class . . . comfort on board is unique . . .
preparation has been patient and minute in its details' - it became
impossible to believe that it was not, literally, a promotional video
produced by the marketing department of Airbus Industries. Perhaps they paid
Discovery to screen it; I hope so.
More common are old American programmes such as The Story Of Rock And Roll
which includes Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and The Byrds but excludes The Beatles,
The Rolling Stones and anybody else who happens to be British. The subject
of Friday's Biography was Joe Di Maggio, baseball player and Marilyn
Monroe's sometime husband from the 1950s. The footage was, like much on
Discovery, in black and white. In case you missed them Airbus and Biography
were repeated mid-evening on Saturday, having also been shown the previous
Tuesday. American Caesar turned out to be an old black and white documentary
about General MacArthur.
Bravo's material is even more consistently black and white than Discovery's,
and although it does include old British B-movies (an antique Edgar Wallace
called To Have And To Hold with William Hartnell and Ray Barrett as
detectives, the 1965 'silent' black and white comedy A Home Of Your Own with
Willie Rushton, Bernard Cribbins and others on a building site, and so on)
it, too, relies mainly on geriatric American television series. Friday
brought Car 54 Where Are You? followed by The Doris Day Show and, later that
evening, one of the oldest American series I have ever seen on British
television: Art Linkletter And The Kids. It is amazing that these exist at
all, having been made in the fifties and, I suspect, even the late forties.
We seem to be rapidly reaching the point where the world's (well, Britain's
and America's) entire stock of old television programmes is being run on one
channel or another all the time. It is, no doubt, a cheap way of filling
schedules, in which case we may wonder why we are asked to pay such a
relatively high price. Though there are 12 channels, with possibly more to
be added, in Sky's basic package, they contain far fewer original programmes
than the BBC's two channels or ITV and Channel 4. True, in October Sky One
will be the first channel in Britain to screen Queen, sequel to the two
Roots series (American of course) and the network is currently in the
process of producing a dramatisation of the Ken Follett novel Red Eagle, the
first time they have ever done such a thing rather than buy from the
American and Australian stockpiles.
However, there is a very long way to go in the origination of drama,
documentary, comedy, arts - virtually all types of programme other than news
and sport - before satellite and cable can be seen as anything other than
re-packaging parasites. The technology may be wonderful but we do not watch
the technology, we watch the programmes.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: The Cenci - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The brief career of Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), poet and atheist,
strayed into drama in 1819 with The Cenci, an ungainly tragedy bravely
staged by The Damned Poets Theatre Company at the Lyric Hammersmith Studio.
The Cenci is domestic horror from 1599. The debauched and lubricous Count
Francesco Cenci, quavering on the edge of sanity, tyrannises over his
household. Only his daughter, Beatrice, stands up to him. But when he rapes
her, the rest of the family, egged on by a slippery cleric, Orsino, has
Cenci strangled to death while he sleeps. The murder is discovered by an
emissary from the Vatican with a warrant for Cenci's arrest; instead, he
arrests the family. Beatrice's brother and step-mother confess under
torture, and are sentenced to death.
While Shelley was writing this, his sister was turning out the much more
popular and profound Frankenstein. Instead of modern science fiction,
Shelley looked back to Greek tragedy and to Shakespeare, the unacknowledged
hero of the play. Cenci is murdered while he is sleeping, like Duncan in
Macbeth; and the assassination is set about with strange noises and finished
off with a knocking at the castle gate, again like Macbeth.
Shelley's friends felt the same way; the English Romantic poets reinvented
Shakespeare in their own image. Keats was haunted by the sound of the surf
in King Lear, Coleridge thought he was Hamlet, and managed three plays
himself. But none wrote a play in this obscure-Shakespearean style.
The verbal action is unremitting. Every character comes on impelled to
speak; and, in accordance with Shelley's views on language, everyone here
speaks in metaphors so convoluted that it is hard to grasp the point of each
scene. The melodramatic plot has a dreadful claustrophobia about it. The
actors are bunched and squashed into a small versatile set (Bruce Gallup)
which transports the action from court to prison with a speed Group 4 could
usefully copy.
The acting, under the uncalm direction of Sydnee Blake, responds to the
excesses in Shelley's text. The effects on stage range from pointless
bluster and overdone pauses through to genuinely felt lines, experienced as
they are delivered. Louise Bangay as Beatrice and Craig Pinder as Cenci have
an uneasy time settling into the mutual loathing Shelley scripted for them,
but Bangay manages to find variety in her roles as abused daughter and fiery
avenger. Other highlights are Andrew Hawkins as a limber prelate, and
Stanley Lloyd as a politic cardinal. Elsewhere the acting was too frenetic
and over eager to do the work of Shelley's own energetic verse.
Despite the intractability of Shelley's drama and the excesses of the actors
faced with the daunting task of putting it on stage, this Cenci is worth
seeing. The company should be applauded for its nerve. Shelley was writing,
as Beatrice says, of 'deeds which have no form, sufferings which have no
tongue,' and it is a bold enterprise to try to stage them.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Suchard grazes on green
pastures - A 'feel good' factor that counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tree planting and chocolate may not seem to have any obvious connection. Yet
Jacobs Suchard, the Zurich-based chocolate and coffee group, was delighted
three years ago to accept sponsorship of reforestation projects in the Alps.
'The idea could have been invented for us,' says Walter Anderau, head of
corporate affairs. The connection is supplied by the lilac Milka cow, a
symbol of one of Jacobs Suchard's most popular chocolate brands. By
protecting the habitat of the Milka cow - a Simmental cow painted lilac for
Suchard's packaging - the message that the chocolate is made from healthy
Alpine milk is made more credible, he argues. Jacobs Suchard's main markets
are Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria, all with Alpine regions.
Since 1991, Jacobs Suchard - part of US products conglomerate Philip Morris
 -has sponsored the planting of 300,000 trees in five countries as part of
its collaboration with Alp Action in the 'Green Roof for Europe' campaign.
This is the biggest of the 30 projects launched by Alp Action, founded by
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan to mobilise corporate funding for environmental
protection in the Alps.
The project, which has cost Jacobs Suchard more than SFr1m (Pounds 444,000),
has involved thousands of children and plays a key role in its marketing
strategy.
Last week, Alp Action and Jacobs Suchard staged a tree planting event at
Lenk, home of the Milka cow, to mark plans to continue their 'Green Roof for
Europe' partnership. Reforestation projects are scheduled for Austria,
France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland over the next two years.
Jacobs Suchard's concern for the environment does not stop with tree
planting. Since 1986, it has sought to 'green' its activities across the
board.
It started with a rethink of packaging requirements, necessitated by the
need to streamline packaging inherited from acquired companies. The group
has since extended its environmental concerns to production, transport and
its housekeeping.
Jacobs Suchard uses a recyclable plastic monofoil for its Milka Lila Pause
chocolate bar which is cheaper, 'greener' and attractive to consumers. Its
redesigned chocolate boxes have saved up to 50 per cent on packaging and
dispensed with polyvinyl chloride.
Similarly, coffee in Germany is sold in vacuum packs containing practically
no aluminium. With the same product protection, Jacobs Suchard claims to
have reduced waste by 47 per cent, energy use by 37 per cent and water
consumption by 48 per cent. The company plans to extend monopacks to all
markets.
Further down the chain, the group uses multi-entry pallets of recyclable
materials for shop deliveries. These pallets are later collected and
re-used. In this way, Jacobs Suchard has cut the total amount of primary and
secondary packaging by 5 per cent - 10,000 tonnes - in three years.
Fuel use per cubic metre transported by the company has been more than
halved from 1987 levels. Packaging has been redesigned and standardised with
efficient packing and transport in mind. Cocoa and coffee beans are
increasingly shifted by rail in special bulk containers; half the tonnage
moved by Jacobs Suchard last year went by train against 5 per cent in 1987.
All this greenery is, says Anderau, more a 'feel good' factor than a big
money saver. Financial costs and benefits are often difficult to identify.
Environmental objectives are just one factor in the investment in new
packaging or factory modernisation.
The company has invested directly about Dollars 23m (Pounds 15m) since 1977
on environmental protection measures. This includes Dollars 4m on its new
chocolate factory in Berlin and Dollars 3m (with Dollars 10m more planned)
on its Lorrach facility near Basle. Anderau reckons these costs probably
offset a large part of the savings from pro-environment activities.
However, the 'feel good' factor counts, for Jacobs Suchard's workers and its
consumers. At Lenk, Jacobs Suchard launched a programme to plant a tree for
every baby born to an employee's family, an Alpine farming tradition.

FT  25 AUG 93 / People: Pilsworth selects Chrysalis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SelecTV, the independent production company that was earlier this year upset
by wranglings between co-founders Michael Buckley and Allan McKeown, is
losing its managing director Michael Pilsworth, who had been in charge of
the UK side, to Chrysalis.
Pilsworth joins as managing director and chief executive of the newly
created visual entertainment division, which groups together a number of
operations including the TV production company, the home video operation and
Red Rooster Film.
Last November, Chrysalis brought Steve Lewis on board from Virgin to head up
the music division, and group chairman Chris Wright says the senior
management team is now complete.
Pilsworth, 42, says he had been talking to Wright, whom he has known since
student days at Manchester University, for the past year. But it was not
until now that he felt he could leave SelecTV so that the transition, in
what is a very small company, would be 'as seamless as possible'. McKeown is
returning from Los Angeles, where he had been based, having opted to run
down the US operation. Buckley was ousted as chairman in March.
'For me Chrysalis is a fantastic global brand name in the record business;
it provides a great opportunity to capitalise on that goodwill for the
visual entertainment side.'
Chrysalis is also targeting a younger audience, in terms of mentality and
cultural interests, if not in age.
Hence it was no accident, Pilsworth thinks, that SelecTV executives were
avid golfers when he was not. Now, by contrast, he is about to take an
intensive tennis course in Spain.
A lecturer in psychology at Manchester before he joined LWT as a research
assistant in 1985, Pilsworth moved to TVS before joining SelecTV.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Containing a spent force - G7
plans to make Bulgaria's Kozloduy nuclear power plant as safe as possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of discussion over how best to provide emergency aid for
the 58 Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in the former east bloc, the Group
of Seven industrialised countries has finally begun to act. It has just
agreed its first joint project, an Ecu24m (Pounds 18m) grant to Kozloduy,
Bulgaria's troubled nuclear power plant.
The grant will be used to import safety equipment for Kozloduy, declared
Europe's most dangerous nuclear power station in 1991. It will be paid out
of the Nuclear Safety Account which was set up by the G7 at the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development last March and had received
contributions of Ecu115m by June.
In return, the Bulgarians have agreed to shut down the plant's four 440MW
VVER (old pressurised water reactor) units - which lack containment to
enclose them in an accident - as soon as financially possible, which may be
by 1998. The EBRD aims to make the plant as safe as possible until this
happens.
Unlike many of the region's other nuclear plants, Kozloduy has already
received much western attention. 'Until now, we've received around Ecu18m
from the EC's Phare programme (funding eastern European projects) and had
some 1,000 western experts visiting Kozloduy, but this has been spent mainly
on analysing the plant and its problems, and on retraining staff,' says
Nikita Shervashidze, deputy chairman of the Bulgarian government's Committee
of Energy.
'The EBRD grant will provide us with hard currency to buy foreign safety
equipment. This will include process computers to make the system more
user-friendly, extra cooling devices, isolation valves, spare parts and
ultrasonic inspection equipment for the pressure vessels.' The equipment
will be purchased through tenders which the EBRD will help NEK, Bulgaria's
state-owned electricity monopoly, to organise.
'One of the weakest points of electricity companies in the former east bloc
is organising procurement, arranging financing and dealing with western
banks. We have no experience in this and will rely on the EBRD's support,'
Shervashidze says.
'We hope we can complete the project within 18 months and set up a model of
how it can be done for other recipients of grants.'
But it is clear the west must provide much more funding if the project is to
fulfil its long-term aim of seeing units one to four closed down.
The Bulgarians are adamant the country needs nuclear energy and say Kozloduy
supplies between 35 and 40 per cent of the country's electricity.
Due to the ageing of the country's non-nuclear plants, this share could rise
to 50 per cent, according to Yanko Yanev, chairman of the Bulgarian Nuclear
Safety Authority (RNSA).
He says the country will not close down the reactors until it can finance
the upgrading of Kozloduy's remaining two 1,000MW units. 'We are willing to
co-operate but we cannot accept some sort of conditionality.
'We are trying to look for energy options which will permit closure of units
one to four, although three and four are relatively new.'
But the two 1,000MW units could cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 357m) each to
modernise and be made more reliable. They are considered safer than the
440MW reactors as they have containment facilities, but have proved to be a
less dependable source of electricity than the older units.
Last September a fire in unit six closed the 1,000MW units - they share a
common spare power supply.
Shervashidze is hoping the EBRD will also help Bulgaria to secure commercial
loans for the upgrading work and for a second nuclear project on the Danube
at Belene which is 60 per cent complete.
But the country looks like having little chance of raising substantial
funding from the west - negotiations with the London club of commercial
banks over Bulgaria's Dollars 11bn debt broke down again in July.
Also, many western countries and institutions, notably the World Bank,
believe that nuclear energy is no longer cost-effective and will not finance
new nuclear plants.
Ivan Uzunov, professor of atomic energy at Sofia University, believes
Kozloduy and other Soviet-built reactors in the region can only be made to
pay if safety standards are compromised. Uzunov, who has advised western
countries such as Austria and Italy on nuclear policy, says a grant of
Ecu24m is 'absolutely nothing' compared with Kozloduy's immediate needs.
He acknowledges the plant's safety has improved substantially in the past
two years, but says he is still not satisfied that units two and three are
sound enough to operate or that the plant's 7,000 employees have had enough
training.
But his main concern is the build-up over the past three years of 600 tonnes
of spent radioactive fuel elements at Kozloduy which are being stored in
pools of water. In cold war days, these were reprocessed by the Russians at
little cost to the Bulgarians. Now, the country faces reprocessing bills of
Dollars 1,000 per kg.
Shervashidze says Kozloduy has storage space for the spent fuel elements for
two more years. He hopes that by then, Bulgaria will have built dry storage
facilities - but again, this requires financing. Uzunov would like to see
alternative storage facilities built as soon as possible.
He says that an explosion at the Soviet Kishtim nuclear plant in the Urals
in 1957 was caused after 70 tonnes of spent fuel elements overheated due to
a shortage of water; parts of the region are still contaminated.
He also believes the Bulgarian authorities have not received enough
independent advice and have been influenced by the western nuclear industry,
hungry for new orders in eastern Europe due to falling domestic demand.
As an alternative to spending on nuclear energy, he is lobbying for western
help to improve energy efficiency at conventional power plants and increase
Bulgaria's connections to international gas pipelines and electricity
networks.

FT  25 AUG 93 / People: Thompson: no rank outsider
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Thompson, until the beginning of this week non-executive chairman of
Rank Xerox in the UK, yesterday moved to Gestetner Holdings. The office
equipment distributor has been looking for a part-time chairman since May,
when Inchcape took a 15 per cent stake and Australian entrepreneur Basil
Sellars, who had been chairman and chief executive as well as, indirectly, a
substantial shareholder, gave up his executive responsibilities.
In the photocopier market, Rank Xerox and Gestetner are competitors in the
medium and smaller machines.
Thompson, 61, who admits to a 'slight lump in the throat' at leaving the
company for which he has worked for 27 years, felt far too young to retire.
Hence, when presented with the current opening, his reaction was simply one
of 'why not?'. He adds: 'With all the wisdom of 12 hours' experience, it
looks as if Gestetner has a reasonable operating structure. It is quite
strong in Latin America, and doing reasonably well in the Far East. Europe
is poor, but so it is for most companies.' In May, a fellow countryman of
Sellars', Greg Megaard, was appointed group managing director.
Thompson says there will be 'an executive tinge' to the job, which will
entail 'taking a close interest in the financial aspects of the business'.
Meanwhile Sellers stays on as a Gestetner non-executive director. 'The
classic assumption is that we will be tripping over each other,' Thompson
acknowledges, but is adamant that this will not be the case. 'We have talked
about it,' he says firmly.
He expects to be in the chairman's seat 'circa three years, maybe longer . .
.if my performance is satisfactory'.
Coming to office machines via the colonial police in the former Northern
Rhodesia, Thompson moved to IBM, working in the UK and the US, before
joining Rank Xerox. He has been chairman of Rank Xerox UK since 1990.

FT  25 AUG 93 / People: Thorn EMI Security and Electronics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hakes, chief executive of Thorn EMI Security and Electronics, the
company's defence electronics arm, is to take immediate 'early retirement'
as part of a radical shake-up at Thorn EMI's defence arm.
The changes follow Thorn EMI's failure to sell its defence electronics
business to GEC, despite months of negotiation. For at least a year it has
been clear that Thorn wants to concentrate on its music and rental
businesses, and to dispose of non-core activities. However, it seems that
Lord Weinstock was unprepared to pay anything like Thorn's asking price,
which is thought to have been in the Pounds 150m range.
Hakes' retirement follows the resignation last month of John Taylor, the
company's former defence systems managing director.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Trying its water wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Lufthansa pulls in its aircraft for regular checks and overhauls every
six years or so, it no longer douses them with powerful paint stripping
agents that contain harsh chemicals such as dichloromethane and phenol.
Instead it gives them the water treatment. At the national carrier's new
DM230m (Pounds 90m) paint hangar in Hamburg, a stream of high-pressure water
is directed at each aircraft. This forces itself under the paint layers and
peels them off.
The paint has to be removed so that aircraft can be inspected for cracks and
corrosion.
Before Lufthansa perfected its robotically operated Aquastrip process, which
it will make available to other airlines, stripping one of its Airbus A300s
needed some 2.5 tonnes of unpleasant chemicals and left 10 tonnes of liquid
waste.
With Aquastrip, lukewarm water is shot towards the aircraft at a shallow
angle from a rotating nozzle. Turning at 6,900 revolutions a minute, this
creates a fan-shaped stream of water so fine that it does not damage the
aluminium skin of the wings and fuselage.
Aquastrip works precisely enough for the three coats of paint to be peeled
away separately.
Each nozzle sprays water at the rate of 37 litres a minute. This water is
then recovered and cleaned of the paint particles. Lufthansa engineers hope
to be able to recycle 97 per cent of the water. The particles are burned in
a special waste incinerator.
Before deciding on Aquastrip, Lufthansa, which has around 220 aircraft,
tried other non-chemical methods of paint removal. One was blasting with dry
ice; the paint layer was broken up by the temperature shock and then ground
away by the sharp-edged crystals. However, this method put a heavy stress on
the thin aircraft skin and could therefore be used only once in its service
life. It also consumed a large amount of energy.
Lufthansa has found that Aquastrip not only helps the environment. It is
even quicker than the old chemical techniques.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Management: Moving towards independence - The changing face
of US boardrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent directors now far outnumber insiders on US boards. But more than
three-quarters of US company chairmen still combine that role with the job
of chief executive.
These are two of the main findings of a new report on corporate governance
from the Conference Board, the worldwide business organisation which has its
headquarters in New York.
The issue of independent, non-executive directors, was highlighted in the US
this month with the enforced departure of Kodak's Kay Whitmore, chairman of
the phototgraphic company. But according to the Conference Board's findings,
US corporations have been making considerable strides in recent years
towards more independent membership.
Many companies, for example, have eliminated directors whose connection with
the company could conflict with their ability to exercise impartial
judgments. Thus 60 per cent of the 546 respondents had no board members
representing leading customers or suppliers (including legal services), or
who were related to or had a significant business connection with a member
of the company's management.
Outsiders were in the majority on 94 per cent of manufacturing and financial
firm boards, and on 93 per cent of non-financial service company boards. In
many companies, the Conference Board comments, chief executives have
initiated the reduction of insiders. In this they appear to be influenced by
the potential advantages of tapping outsiders' knowledge and contacts, the
need to slim down board sizes and pressure from the corporate governance
lobby.
Another trend is management's loosened grip on the director nomination
process through greater acceptance of the board nominating committee. The
Conference Board notes, for example, that only 8 per cent of companies
surveyed 20 years ago had such a committee - comprising solely outside
directors and charged mainly with the task of finding and screening possible
candidates for nomination to vacant board seats. The current figure is 64
per cent.
More than 90 per cent of boards now have a compensation committee, against
69 per cent two decades ago.
The finding that 76 per cent of chairmen combine the role of chief executive
may seem a touch unlikely to a UK audience. Since the publication of the
Cadbury report on corporate governance in 1991, splitting the two jobs in
big companies has become very much de rigueur.
The Conference Board states that combining them in the US is 'clearly the
established pattern'. It follows that 'most CEOs expect to hold both
positions when they assume leadership of a company. But the practice has
again come under fire, as it did in the early 1970s'.
Another section of the report highlights what directors actually do. Those
in financial companies spend on average 35 per cent of their time on board
committees, against 30 per cent for non-financial service companies and 24
per cent for manufacturing concerns. Committee time increases, though, as
company size expands.
Median board meeting lengths range from two and a half hours in financial
firms to three and a half hours in manufacturing companies.
In the largest manufacturing and financial firms the median board meeting
frequency is nine times a year, although in some the frequency is as low as
four and as high as 12.
At board meetings directors spend two-thirds of their time on three main
concerns: strategic issues (a median of 25 per cent), financial management
(21 per cent), and operations control (20 per cent). Forty four per cent of
the manufacturing companies said their directors were 'very diligent' in
preparing for meetings, but the figure drops to 39 per cent and 34 per cent
for non-financial service firms and financial firms respectively.
The report includes a brief section on Europe, based on interviews with
corporate executives in eight countries.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Management: Success tool or passing fad?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As management fashions go, few have been more pervasive than Total Quality
Management. Over two-thirds of Britain's largest companies are converts to
TQM, fervently believing that it holds the secret to business success.
But experience suggests otherwise. Evidence is emerging that TQM schemes are
failing because they have been poorly designed and implemented.
There is also a growing belief that the concept may be flawed - rather than
being a management panacea, TQM is beginning to look like another fad.
A recent survey of Britain's largest 500 companies by marketing consultancy,
Abram, Hawkes, shows that many of the schemes are half baked: two-thirds do
not set quality performance targets, and even when they do exist, less than
half have a mechanism for reward when those targets are met.
Perhaps more alarming, TQM schemes do not seem to be delivering their
supposed financial benefits. Although most companies surveyed say that the
schemes have increased customer satisfaction, only one-third have noticed an
increase in sales and only a half have reported higher profits.
Overall, less than 50 per cent of the companies say they are satisfied with
TQM, and only 8 per cent are 'very satisfied'. The results are particularly
surprising as the questions were addressed to managers responsible for the
quality programmes.
One of the reasons for the frequent failure of TQM programmes to deliver
so-called quality, the study suggests, is they are sold to the companies by
outside consultancies that have little interest in the long-term success of
such schemes. The research shows that nearly 60 per cent of companies use
external quality consultants when planning total quality implementation.
Alternatively, schemes may be failing because they are not properly
implemented: many companies complain that middle managers have not supported
or understood what TQM entailed.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Management: When quality is a way of life - Telco has
developed a peculiarly Indian blend of ideas for motivating workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India may not be the first place to conjure up images of industrial
efficiency or total quality management. While decades of bureaucratic
controls restrained India's industrial performance, companies all too often
subscribed to the old Indian adage of chalta hai or 'it'll pass'.
But if that is now all changing - not least thanks to the economic reforms
of finance minister Manmohan Singh - one company stands out as a benchmark
for others to follow.
The truck and excavator company Telco (Tata Engineering and Locomotive
Company) has developed a peculiarly Indian approach to quality and worker
participation in a nation that has to contend with issues - from communal
tensions to the effects of deshi or country liquor - not always on the
agenda of western boardrooms.
Based in Jamshedpur, Bihar, Telco is one of the flagship companies in the
blue-chip Tata group. With its sister car plant in Pune, it is India's
largest private-sector concern, with a turnover last year of Rs29,000m,
approximately (Pounds 612m).
Established in 1945, originally as a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz, it is
one of the world's largest truck manufacturers, providing 75 per cent of the
goods vehicles and buses on India's roads. It has exported them to 60
countries. Last year the millionth truck rolled off the assembly line and
recently Telco secured its largest export order, for 2,100 truck chassis,
from the Sri Lankan government.
'Quality and productivity are essential in helping us to compete worldwide,'
says Sarosh Ghandy, resident director in Jamshedpur. 'We are investing in
our 'software': building on the skills, commitment and involvement of our
men.'
A crippling 40-day strike in 1969 and a series of shop-floor battles for
union control in the early 1970s, had warned management 'we were far too
distant from our men to liaise with them', says Ghandy. Union officers and
senior executives subsequently attended moral re-armament industrial
seminars organised by a grandson of Mahatma Gandhi. Impressed by the
reconciliation of two rival union leaders, the company launched its own
in-house 'human relations at work' (HRW) training programme in 1982.
The focus of this is a three-day course, attended so far by 18,000 of
Telco's 20,000 employees. The aim is to empower the workforce to take
responsibility.
Shop floor workers, who have passed through the course, do the training and
at one afternoon session a chargehand from the toolroom, RB Singh, conducts
a programme for 20 employees.
Topics for discussion are alcoholism, absenteeism, punctuality,
synchronising work functions, responsibility versus blame and even blood
donation schemes.
Hindu swamis (priests) also give talks on aspects of human behaviour, to
'bring an Indian ethos into our environment of management', says Ghandy.
There is also an emphasis on the Gandhian philosophy of the 'inner voice' -
to encourage 'self-motivation', says Telco's head of management development,
Nazimuddin Ahmed. 'Really motivated people are inner directed.
' They have a characteristic of their own and are not dependent on others.'
The visible manifestation has been the birth of shop-floor quality circles,
known in Telco as 'small group activity' (SGA). Now, nearly 1,300 voluntary
groups of 10 to 12 people, involving the bulk of the workforce, meet for an
hour each week to iron out production problems - and discuss how to tackle
alcoholism, family debt and communal tension in their townships or
'colonies'.
One group bailed out a colleague who became heavily in debt after personal
problems. Another group repaired a fault on a metal press which had baffled
German engineers.
Each year, employees make 100,000 suggestions for improvements, saving the
company nearly Pounds 2m, says Ghandy.
Telco is now making 16,000 more trucks with 6,000 fewer workers and has
enjoyed a strike-free industrial record over the last 21 years. Ghandy says
that the productivity increase is also due to the impact of the SGAs.
The SGAs also help to defuse any communal and political tensions, according
to Shri Gopeshwar, General Secretary of India's National Trade Union
Congress (INTUC), who is head of the Telco workers' union.
When the Babri mosque at Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants, sparking
nationwide violence, relations in the townships around Telco remained calm
and the police found it unnecessary to impose a curfew.
Telco, in common with many companies in the west, still faces the challenge
of how to reduce the multiple layers of middle management.
But other Indian companies are taking a keen interest in Telco's experience.
Chandreshwar Khan, assistant manager at the Management Training Centre gives
talks on HRW to conferences of the Confederation of Indian Industry.
'Improvements in the quality of our products will come from an improvement
in the quality of life of our workforce,' he says. 'In our company we talk
about human relations, meaning we work together. And we don't just talk
about it - it has become a way of life.'

FT  25 AUG 93 / Ex-Swans workers in mass claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 500 former employees of Swan Hunter have lodged claims of unfair
dismissal as part of a union campaign to highlight the position of workers
made redundant by receivers.
The claims have been flooding into the Newcastle industrial tribunal centre
since union leaders at the Tyneside shipbuilder wrote last week to more than
700 ex-employees made redundant since the company went into receivership in
mid-May.
Should the employees' claims succeed they would be unlikely, as unsecured
creditors, to receive any additional compensatory pay-offs: a creditors'
meeting earlier this month was told by receivers Price Waterhouse that Swan
Hunter had total liabilities of Pounds 51m, and realisable assets estimated
at Pounds 6.29m.
But Swans union leaders hope their move, which follows a similar initiative
by Leyland Daf union officials, will raise concern at how receivership can
harm employees' redundancy entitlements.
Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said: 'Receivership shouldn't put on ice the rights of
the individual; they should be sacrosanct.'
Swan Hunter's now defunct company severance scheme paid up to Pounds 13,000;
employees made redundant by the receivers must apply to the Department of
Employment under the state redundancy fund, which pays a maximum of Pounds
6,150.
Newcastle industrial tribunals centre said staff had been working extra
hours to process the sudden Swan Hunter workload. More Swans claims, under
the 1985 Employment Protection Act, are expected.
The unions claim the dismissals were unfair because of lack of consultation,
lack of right of appeal and lack of information on selection criteria.
Price Waterhouse declined to comment.

FT  25 AUG 93 / BAe computer staff to strike over jobs threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECTION of staff in the military aircraft division of British Aerospace
will tomorrow stage a one-day strike in Lancashire against what unions say
are plans to 'sell their jobs' to one of three US companies.
The strike, which will involve about 450 computer and information technology
specialists and other staff, will affect factories in Warton, Preston and
Samlesbury where BAe makes the Tornado ground attack bomber, the Hawk jet
trainer and parts of EFA, the European Fighter Aircraft.
The Manufacturing Science and Finance white-collar union said yesterday that
BAe wants to 'outsource' up to Pounds 250m of information technology work.
The union claimed this would remove the company's ability to control its own
information technology systems and pose a threat to national security.
Mr Frank Coulton, chairman of the MSF branch for the three factories,
claimed secrets of military aircraft design and know-how would be given to a
foreign company, even if the US was an ally. MPs sponsored by MSF and
GMB/Apex, another union involved, are to raise the issue with the
government.
Outsourcing - where a company contracts out formerly in-house services  -
has been growing in the recession, with computer bureaux offering economies
of scale and savings in functions such as warehouse management, stock
control, invoicing and debt collection. The work usually involves large
numbers of small transactions.
BAe said investigations on outsourcing had been under way for several months
as a part of a general review of efficiency and cost reductions, but no
decision had been made. It said detailed tenders for the work had been
sought from an IBM-DEC consortium, Computer Science Corporation, and
EDS-Scicon. All three bidders are US companies.
BAe declined to say what work would be involved, but MSF said its
negotiations with BAe suggested it was all mainframe computer activity,
including some computer-aided design and manufacture, as well as routine
clerical and management systems.
BAe workers would be transferred to the contractor if any outsourcing is
agreed. Mr Coulton said: 'They are trying to sell people and their know-how.
We refuse to be sold.
'Our members have voted 11 to one to show their feelings with this one-day
strike. We felt we had to act before a formal offer on outsourcing was put
to us. Once the company has decided to do it, it would be difficult to make
management change its mind, and much tougher industrial action would be
needed.'
BAe said the outsourcing investigations did not involve Rover cars or the
group's construction business, only aerospace. About 15 factories would be
involved throughout Britain.
Exact numbers were 'imprecise' because no decision had been taken on what
exactly might be outsourced, but MSF said about 2,000 jobs would be
affected.
The Lancashire factories - established in the second world war beyond the
range of German bombers - employ about 11,000, about 3,000 of whom are MSF
members, working in range of high-technology professions and trades.

FT  25 AUG 93 / TGWU defends farm pay body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOLITION of the Agricultural Wages Board, which sets minimum pay for
238,000 farmworkers, could breach the European Community's Treaty of Rome,
the Transport and General Workers' Union said yesterday.
Launching a campaign with the Labour party to save the board, the union
pointed out that Article 39 (1b) of the treaty states that the common
agricultural policy should ensure a fair standard of living for the farming
community, in particular by increasing individual earnings.
'Abolition would be a clear challenge to the European Commission,' said Mr
Barry Leathwood, national secretary of the union's rural, agricultural and
allied workers group.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, last week extended the deadline
for consultation on the board's future until November, after pressure from
farmers and farm workers. The board is the last statutory body fixing
minimum wages for low-paid workers, after legislation to scrap wages
councils which Mrs Shephard guided through parliament as employment
secretary. The union fears any government decision to end minimum pay would
mean pay cuts, less investment in training and threats to safety and
hygiene.
Most farmers want rates to continue being fixed centrally to avoid
potentially difficult negotiations with employees.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, predicted industrial conflict if the
board went. 'If we're driven to negotiate farm by farm, that's precisely
what will happen,' he said. 'Farmworkers must become either slave labour or
industrial fighters.'
The board controls minimum pay, holidays and sick leave for full-time,
part-time and casual farmworkers. Average earnings are estimated at 76 per
cent of the average industrial wage.
The TGWU calculates that 43 per cent of full-time male farmworkers and 68
per cent of their female equivalents earn less than the low pay threshold.
Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, said: 'With so much taxpayers'
money going into farming, it would be outrageous if action was taken to
further erode the low wages of farmworkers.'

FT  25 AUG 93 / Nissan plant set to cut car output target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is reviewing output levels at its UK plant
and is expected to be forced to cut its present target of producing 270,000
cars this year.
Production levels throughout the UK motor industry are under heavy pressure
because of the continuing sharp decline in new car sales in continental
Europe.
Nissan had planned to raise output at its Pounds 900m car plant at
Sunderland in north-east England by 51 per cent this year to 270,000 from
the 179,000 cars produced last year.
'With the situation in Europe as it is, it is beginning to look as if we
will not reach that target,' the company said yesterday.
Around 88 per cent of production was exported last year, but this share has
fallen in 1993, as the UK has emerged as the only market in west Europe
where sales of new cars are growing.
The Sunderland plant, which now has a capacity to produce up to 300,000 cars
a year, has been under development since the mid-1980s. This is the first
year that it has been able to produce two car ranges, the Primera large
family car and the Micra small car, at full capacity following the launch of
the Micra in the second half of last year.
The start-up of Micra production has allowed Nissan to raise its output in
the first half of 1993 by 90 per cent to 140,713 from 74,214 in the
corresponding period a year ago.
However, output at the plant was already coming under pressure from the
sales decline in continental Europe in the early summer when Nissan was
forced to lower planned Primera output by 15 per cent to 110,000 from the
previous target of 130,000.
This reduction was offset by the decision to raise the Micra production
target from 140,000 to 160,000.
Nissan was the first of the Japanese carmakers to establish a car assembly
base in Europe, and it has now become the first to be caught up in the
recession that is hitting all the established car producers in Europe.
Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot have all been forced to reduce production in the
UK this year. Overall UK car output in the first seven months at 858,617 was
6.6 per cent higher than a year ago because of the higher output from Nissan

FT  25 AUG 93 / Courts 'failing on Citizen's Charter'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENDING court is still a bewildering experience for members of the public
in spite of promises under the Citizen's Charter to make court services more
user-friendly, the National Consumer Council said yesterday.
It published a survey showing that many county courts were failing to live
up to the promises of the charter.
Contrary to a central intention of the Citizen's Charter, of the 12 per cent
of those interviewed who wanted to make a complaint about court services, 76
per cent did not know there was a complaints procedure.
The council asked 819 people using 35 county courts in England and Wales
about their experience. Business users, lawyers and advice workers were
excluded.
It said 92 per cent of those surveyed had not been told about the
facilities.
Mr John Taylor, parliamentary secretary at the Lord Chancellor's Department,
said parts of the report were very useful and constructive and would be
considered further. 'However, in overall terms, due to the timing of the
survey and unavoidable practical difficulties experienced in some areas, the
results contained in the report are not a fair judgment and certainly do not
reflect the current situation.'

FT  25 AUG 93 / Bigger trucks carry a heavy payload of disappointment: A
reform trumpeted as a boost for rail will struggle to take freight off roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced earlier this month
that 44-tonne lorries were to be allowed on Britain's roads he would have
expected criticism from the environmental lobby.
But there was also disappointment among hauliers that the lorries were to be
permitted only for journeys to and from rail freight terminals. The
opportunity had been missed, they said, to raise weight restrictions on the
whole range of freight traffic.
The 44-tonne limit applies to trucks carrying containers or drawing
swap-bodies - vehicle bodies that can be demounted from the tractor and
transferred on to trains.
Mr MacGregor says he wants to put container lorries and swap-bodies on level
terms with conventional lorries that make road-only deliveries as part of
the government's strategy of reversing the decline in rail freight compared
with road freight.
Containers and swap-bodies are heavier when empty than conventional truck
bodies, which have a competitive advantage over the containers and swap
bodies needed for a combination of road and rail journeys. Under the old
38-tonne limit for articulated lorries, which will still apply to
non-road/rail traffic, conventional vehicles could carry more cargo than
swap-bodies, which could not carry their full capacity.
Mr Bill Newton, manager of the environment research centre at the Transport
Research Laboratory, a government agency, said: 'We are getting into a
situation where rail freight is almost entirely moving bulk goods - coal,
oil, aggregates, some bulk steel and refuse.'
The Channel tunnel has raised new hopes of developing the rail freight
industry because, generally, the longer the distance the goods are carried,
the more cost-effective a rail component is.
On the Continent, where most countries already have a 44-tonne limit for
lorries geared to road-rail travel, the use of swap-bodies tripled between
1980 and 1989. If there had been no move to relax British regulations, the
tunnel would have highlighted the UK as an anomaly.
Continental freight carriers may be the first to benefit from the UK rule
change because they have already invested in swap-bodies.
Railfreight Distribution, which will run the main Channel tunnel freight
services, admits the investment in swap-bodies is crucial for intermodal
(combined road-rail) travel but admits to uncertainty about the level of
demand.
Railfreight Distribution, British Rail's freight subsidiary, is selling its
train space to two intermediate wholesalers - Allied Continental Intermodal,
and Combined Transport, a consortium of Continental intermodal - road/rail -
companies and UK road transport operators. They will sell train space to
freight forwarders and transport operators.
Mr Mike Stockdale, Combined Transport's commercial manager, says the company
would initially have three trains a day in each direction, with swap bodies,
tanks and containers carrying the equivalent of 26 lorry-loads. By 1995, he
forecasts five trains a day.
It seems improbable that 44-tonnes lorry will become common on the roads as
soon as they are permitted in the autumn. Their proliferation will depend on
the popularity of Channel tunnel rail freight and, as Railfreight admits,
much about the tunnel is uncertain.
Most of the 44-tonners willtravel to and from Britain's nine Channel tunnel
railfreight terminals. Some critics believe that this limited number of
freight terminals is the greatest obstacle to reversing the decline in rail
freight.
Freight terminals no longer shunt individual wagons in and out of sidings,
because it is no longer economic, and instead concentrate on shifting whole
trains. The sorting of the components of each train is done by road,
bringing together a train's worth of containers and swap-bodies.
But if goods are a long way from the nearest rail freight terminal, there is
a strong case for keeping them on the road. Especially since at the other
end of the journey there is very little to stop a 38-tonne lorry making
deliveries to the doorstep of high street shops.
Mr Ken Buchan of the Metropolitan Transport Research Unit, an independent
consultancy which was commissioned to look at freight traffic by the
environmental pressure group Transport 2000, says the bias against rail
freight is greater than a matter of weight restrictions.
Road freight, he argues, is not paying its costs in environmental and safety
terms, and will continue to have economic advantages over rail until it is
made to do so.
But Mr MacGregor, now that he has decided to permit some 44-tonne vehicles,
may find it more difficult to resist the road lobby's pleas to raise weight
limits for all traffic.
He has said the new vehicles will be no bigger and cause no more wear to
roads than existing vehicles. The road lobby is sure to use that same
argument in an attempt to drive a bigger hole through the 38-tonne limit.

UNION RAILWAYS, the British Rail subsidiary responsible for the Channel
tunnel link, is investigating the feasibility of extending its tunnelling in
London should St Pancras Station be chosen as the terminus for the link,
Lisa Wood writes.
The study was in response to local protests over proposals, still being
considered, for trains to travel to St Pancras Station alongside the
existing North London line through Islington in north London, Union Railways
said.
It added that it would carry out a feasibility study of siting a tunnel
underneath the North London line, one of a number of options still being

Mr Albert Pacey, 54, former chief constable of Gloucestershire, said: 'We
are concerned that the public, who are rightly anxious about street crime,
will, as a result, forget the hidden dangers of sophisticated drug
trafficking, fraud, money laundering and major robberies and burglaries.
Its financial intelligence unit had assessed more than 16,000 disclosures
from banks and other financial houses on suspicious transactions - one in
eight had led to further police or Customs inquiries.
Its counterfeit currency unit has provided information for seven police
operations netting more than Pounds 8m in forged sterling.
The service was launched 17 months ago to co-ordinate the combating of
serious crime.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Bus reform fears rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to press ahead with the deregulation of London's bus
services in spite of gloomy backbench forecasts of a backlash from voters.
The decision means ministers could find themselves fighting backbench
opponents on both bus deregulation and the details of rail privatisation
when parliament reconvenes in October.
Mr Steven Norris, the London transport minister, said the government was
committed to deregulation, which was promised in the Conservative manifesto
for the 1992 election.
Mr Norris said the government would avoid the transitional problems which
led to complaints when services outside the capital were deregulated in the
mid-1980s.
He also gave an unequivocal assurance that the Travelcard system, which
allows passengers to switch between different modes of transport, would be
retained.
Mr Norris's comments were aimed at calming Conservative critics inside and
outside parliament who fear that deregulation will lead to higher fares and
cuts in services.
Backbench critics showed no signs of backing down, however. Sir Rhodes
Boyson, Conservative MP for Brent North, said deregulation was 'a form of
suicide pill' for Conservative prospects in London council elections next
May.
Worryingly for ministers, Sir Rhodes linked deregulation to other issues
causing backbench unease, including railway privatisation and health and
education reforms.
He said: 'I think the government is doing too much. It is running around all
over the place and falling off cliff edges.'
Ministers believe the government would have little difficulty in forcing bus
deregulation through the Commons as part of an omnibus deregulation bill
being prepared by the trade and industry department.
But even a small rebellion on deregulation would increase the aura of
disunity on the Conservative benches.
Government sensitivity on the issue was underlined by a plea for unity by
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, in the latest issue of Newsline, the
Conservative newspaper.

FT  25 AUG 93 / High-tech speeding levy mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTRONIC tagging devices the government is considering introducing to
charge motorists for using motorways could also be used to surcharge drivers
for speeding, a minister has suggested.
Mr Robert Key, roads minister, said he could envisage a situation where
motorists would be charged for every mile they broke the speed limit.
'You would know before you set out that if the speed limit was 70mph and you
were doing 80mph, it was going to cost you and it was going to hurt,' he
told Carweek magazine.
In May the Department of Transport suggested in a green paper that motorways
could be operated profitably by charging users, imposing tolls of up to 1.5p
a mile or an annual fee of up to Pounds 75.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, indicated in June that annual
permits were the 'most realistic option' if the government decided to move
quickly, as electronic tolling probably would not be 'technologically
achievable' until at least 1998. But he said electronic tolling offered
'more flexibility in the long run'.
The Department of Transport said yesterday the government had 'a very open
mind' on whether to introduce road charging.
Mr Key was not implying that charging speeding motorists in the way outlined
was going to be government policy.
Under the approach set out by Mr Key, motorists could be charged an extra
50p a mile for every 5mph they were travelling over the speed limit.
The AA criticised the proposal for suggesting that the rich could break the
law. 'Charging premium rate tolls for speeding motorists sounds like a
charter for the law-breaking rich,' it said.

<TEXT>
URBAN DEVELOPMENT corporations have failed to meet at least 40 per cent of
their performance targets, the National Audit Office, the government
spending watchdog, says in a report today.
But the NAO doubts whether performance measures have been well-defined, and
suggests that the corporations may be even less successful. It says that the
Department of the Environment has not been given sufficient information to
fulfil its supervisory role.
The report by Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, says output
data are unreliable, that some achievements claimed by the corporations
resulted from developments started before they were established, and that
measures are inconsistently defined.
It also raises questions about whether some projects in the pipeline will
contribute to regeneration.
The eight corporations covered by the report, which were established between
1987 and 1989, are projecting delivery of 5.5m sq metres of floor space
during their lifetimes, in spite of a recent survey which found that 14m sq
m of industrial floorspace is available in England, including 1.6m sq m in
new buildings.
Some building plans exceed the corporations' estimates of what is necessary.
In the areas of two of the corporations - Trafford Park and Central
Manchester - demand for 840,000 sq m has been identified by the
corporations, which plan to build 1.29m sq m.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Jobs boost for consumer confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence in the health of the economy has increased again,
fuelled by a growing belief that unemployment has stopped rising, the latest
Gallup survey of consumer confidence shows.
The survey, conducted on behalf of the European Community, found that when
asked about prospects for growth, optimists outweighed pessimists by 6
percentage points.
Thirty-four per cent of the 2,042 respondents expect the general economic
situation to improve in the next 12 months, against 28 per cent who expect
it to deteriorate.
The balance of 6 per cent is 11 points higher than the July result. With the
exception of May, when expectations soared briefly only to evaporate, this
month's figure is the best since June last year.
The positive assessment of the economy apparently stems from brighter
expectations about jobs. Less than half (49 per cent) of Gallup's
respondents predict an increase in unemployment in the next 12 months, while
20 per cent expect the jobless total to fall.
The still positive balance of 29 per cent expecting unemployment to increase
is nonetheless 11 percentage points lower than the July figure.
The balances in this particular series have fallen sharply since the
beginning of the year. In February a balance of 74 per cent of respondents
expected unemployment to increase over the year ahead.
More people believe now is the right time to make a big purchase, possibly
indicating that consumers are becoming less worried about committing
themselves to significant retail spending.
But consumers are not yet convinced that their own financial health will
improve. In spite of optimism about the general economic situation only 20
per cent of households expect their financial position to improve in the
next 12 months. They remain outnumbered by those who expect it to
deteriorate.
A survey yesterday from Brook Street, the recruitment specialists, suggested
that optimism about the economy is also prevalent in industry.
A survey of 1,514 companies showed that 61 per cent expect an upturn in
business before the end of the year. Almost 40 per cent indicated their
intention to take on more employees by the end of the year.
The number of business failures tumbled in the second quarter of the year in
England and Wales, figures published yesterday show.
According to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm which compiled the
figures, company liquidations fell 10.5 per cent from the previous three
months and individual bankruptcies dropped by 21.5 per cent.
Company liquidations fell to 5,265 from 5,881 in the first quarter of the
year, while bankruptcies dropped to 7,403 from 9,435.

AN 'anti-science' mood is sweeping Britain and undermining medical research,
Sir David Weatherall, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University,
said yesterday.
Sir David, president of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, was speaking in advance of the association's annual meeting at
Keele University next week.
He said young people blamed science for environmental problems and were
alarmed by the 'Jurassic Park' image of genetic research. They were also
concerned about 'the possible stigmatisation of people' carrying undesirable
genes.
Despite high-profile developments in genetic research, people could not see
improvements in healthcare, Sir David said.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Asda sees threat from discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD discounters and US-style warehouse clubs pose a serious threat to large
UK superstore operators, Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, warns
today.
Mr Norman said in June the 'halcyon days' of UK food retailing were over,
with the industry unable to support planned store openings without a
downturn in margins and sales growth. On 'In Business', to be broadcast on
BBC Radio 4 tonight, he warns that superstores are wrong to assume
discounters operate in a different part of the market.
'The reality is we're all selling food. The warehouse clubs will affect the
food retailing industry as will the discounters. They'll sure as hell have
an impact and will attract a lot of attention because they are a very
dramatically different style of retailing.'
The three largest superstore chains, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, have
denied that discounters such as Aldi, Netto and Shoprite, and warehouse
clubs - which sell goods at very low prices from huge sheds - will damage
their business. But they have joined forces to try to overturn planning
permission granted to US warehouse club operator Costco at Thurrock, Essex,
prompting allegations of collusion and calls for an Office of Fair Trading
investigation.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, owner of Safeway, says on the
programme he 'wouldn't feel uncomfortable' about an OFT investigation. He
denies supermarket chains have colluded to fix prices.

FT  25 AUG 93 / University clearing opens with arts course squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEARING system for UK universities starts today with indications that
rejections of candidates for arts courses have been significantly higher
than last year.
But the Polytechnic Central Admissions System reported that two 'E' grades -
the lowest grade of A-level pass - would be sufficient to gain entry into
many science and engineering courses.
Mr Tony Higgins, chief executive of PCAS, said: 'The absence of arts and
social science courses is striking. But the place is seething with science
and engineering courses.'
He added that admissions tutors for arts subjects had had to adopt much
stricter criteria. 'In normal years admissions tutors have three piles -
yes, maybe and no. This year they need to be much more decisive, and the
only piles are yes and no.'
The Universities Central Council on Admissions (Ucca), which will merge with
PCAS later this year, reported that more courses were still open than at the
same stage last year, although vacancies in arts subjects were restricted to
combined courses.
It predicted that more applicants would qualify for clearing this year,
leading to a higher proportion of ultimate rejections. The total number of
students accepted by Ucca members, which exclude the old polytechnics, could
slightly exceed that for last year.
University vice-chancellors, who have lobbied intensively in the past week
for the government to direct more funds to higher education - possibly by
requiring students to take out loans - said that changes in government
funding were to blame for the problem. The government has cut the fees which
it pays universities for tuition in arts courses.
The Committee for Vice-Chancellors and Principals said: 'Given the
government's very clear insistence that it doesn't want to see the expansion
continue for the time being, universities feel bound to be strict. They
won't be able to offer alternative courses to applicants who miss out
narrowly any more.'
Yesterday the committee stepped up this campaign by calling for the
government to increase 'access funds' for students, and to rename them
'hardship funds'.
It said: 'They have no effect on access to higher education, since payment
is not made until the student is registered. They are no more than a rather
inadequate safety net.'
Applications by students rose by 15 per cent between 1990-91 and 1991-92,
but available funds rose by only 4 per cent. The committee suggested that
funds should also be made available out of term, because vacation jobs were
hard to find and students could no longer claim benefits.
Total access funds in 1992-93 were Pounds 19.17m.
The committee's efforts to blame the government for the sharp fall in the
supply of arts and humanities places available through clearing seem, so far
at least, to have found no resonance among Tory backbenchers.
Mr James Pawsey, chairman of the party's backbench education committee, said
he was 'a little disappointed' by the committee's attitude, given the
expansion of higher education and the resources available for it since 1979.

FT  25 AUG 93 / MPs serve up multi-million pound food bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY committee of MPs is expected to recommend a multi-million
pound facelift for catering and dining facilities in the Palace of
Westminster to bring them up to acceptable safety and hygiene standards.
The catering committee report, which is expected in November, follows the
first ever strategic assessment of Westminster's venerable catering
facilities.
'We are trying to deal with 50 to 100 years of botch,' according to Mr Colin
Shepherd, Tory MP for Hereford and committee chairman. 'If it had been in
the private sector, we would have been served with a notice,' he added.
According to Mr Shepherd, a report by a firm of independent consultants into
hygiene in Westminster's collection of kitchens and dining-rooms had been
'fairly devastating in technical terms'.
The report is thought to have highlighted a wide range of defects in areas
such as tiling, guttering, refrigeration (which has now been dealt with) and
flow paths, where incoming food came into contact with prepared food. A
report into health and safety aspects is thought to have pointed to
inadequate passage space at a number of facilities.
About four weeks ago Mr Anthony Steen, the Conservative MP for South Hams
and a catering committee member, told MPs he understood they were to
authorise spending 'about Pounds 19m' on updating the kitchens. This figure
is thought to be on the high side.
The Westminster facilities enjoy Crown immunity from prosecution under
hygiene and health and safety statutes. The policy, however, is to comply
with relevant legislation.
The Commons refreshment department yesterday published its annual accounts
for the year ended April 1, showing a 1 per cent increase in turnover to
Pounds 3.34m. Of this, Pounds 1.39m was attributed to House services, Pounds
1.3m to private banqueting and Pounds 0.65m to souvenir kiosks and shops.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Charter urged for utility regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should set up a charter to give regulators of the privatised
utilities clear directions on their role, says a report published today by
the European Policy Forum.
Mr Cento Veljanovski, a commentator on regulation, says a charter would end
the sometimes acrimonious relationships between the regulators and the
companies they watch over.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said last week it hoped that the
bitter relations between British Gas and Sir James McKinnon, head of the
regulator Ofgas, would ease as Ofgas concentrated on more technical issues.
The commission noted that a change of personnel at the gas regulator was
imminent - Sir James is due to retire in October - and said this, with the
fact that Ofgas would be concentrating on more technical issues, could allow
it to build a more constructive relationship with the company.
But Mr Veljanovski says that relying on a change of personnel is simply
postponing the real issue. 'The danger is if the regulator changes so does
the law,' he says. A charter would set down some rules for regulators to
follow, circumscribing their discretion.
The monopolies commission said it could not comment on the regulatory system
in its reports on the gas industry as it would need a specific request from
the government to do so. Mr Veljanovski calls on the government to set up
such an inquiry to be chaired by a figure with legal and regulatory
expertise.
He believes this inquiry should draw up the regulatory charter setting out
the principles of good regulation.
Under the charter a regulator would have to call formal hearings before the
monopolies commission if he or she wanted to change a utility's terms of
operation. These hearings would be open to public scrutiny and third-party
representation.
Increased regulation would have to be cost-effective, Mr Veljanovski says.
Regulators should also have to consult more widely and give reasons for
their decisions.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Unit trust funds bounce to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW interest rates and a buoyant stock market gave a further fillip to unit
trust sales in July, with a net Pounds 948m flowing in, according to the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. Funds under management
reached a new high of Pounds 78.8bn, up from Pounds 76.3bn at the end of
June.
The industry has benefited substantially from sterling's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism, and the consequent falls in base rates.
Income offered by some unit trust personal equity plans (where returns are
tax-free) is now higher than that provided by many building society
accounts. Total net investment (gross sales minus repurchases) in the year
to July was Pounds 5.25bn.
Private investors were responsible for nearly half (Pounds 453m) of the net
sales in July. The most popular sectors were UK balanced, UK equity income
and UK general funds. In July 1992, private investors made net withdrawals
of Pounds 98m from the sector.
Gross sales of unit trusts in July 1993 were Pounds 1,631m, the eighth
successive month in which they topped Pounds 1bn. If the pace continues,
gross sales will outstrip the previous record of Pounds 14.55bn, reached in
1987.
The number of unitholder accounts, in steady decline since the crash of
October 1987, is also on the increase. After touching a recent low of 4.35m
at the end of last year, accounts have increased to 4.68m, indicating that
the industry has a growing appeal.
The revival in the stock market has also helped unit trust performance, with
the average UK equity income fund returning 28.6 per cent over the year to
August 1 (offer-to-bid with income reinvested; source Hardwick Stafford
Wright). The best performing sector over the same period was Japan, which
produced growth of 91.8 per cent.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Brazilian states agree over debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELEVEN of Brazil's 27 states signed an accord yesterday to restart repayment
of up to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.3bn) owed to federal government agencies,
in the first concrete step towards improving the Treasury's cashflow and
balancing public accounts, writes Christina Lamb in Braslia.
Under the accord, whose signatories include the biggest debtor states such
as Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, the federal government
has the right to suspend revenue transfers to the states if they miss debt
repayments.
The debt is to be restructured over 20 years with 240 monthly instalments.
On signing, the states made a symbolic Dollars 38m payment to the National
Savings Bank, to which they owe Dollars 9bn.
However, for the accord to come into effect, Congress must approve enabling
legislation in a vote due next week and the Senate must decide on the level
of payments for each state.
The federal government wants the states to pledge 11 per cent of receipts
for debt payments. However, state governors insist they cannot commit more
than 7 per cent.
To get the accord the government had to give in to various demands by the
states.
It will assume much of the debt Rio state built up over its ill-fated metro
project and discount money owed to the state power distribution companies by
Eletrobras, the state holding company. The final amount to be repaid to the
federal government may be nearer Dollars 11bn than the Dollars 20bn
originally hoped for.
Following the government victory on wage legislation, the signing of the
debt accord is the second piece of good news in a week for Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Coal strike talks to restart today
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of the US's largest coal mine operators and the United
Mineworkers of America will meet in Washington today in an attempt by
federal mediators to end a long-running strike that has hit about 10 per
cent of US coal production.
However, both sides have called today's talks 'exploratory', and neither
expects a quick end to the dispute.
Mineworkers have been striking at eastern and central mines owned by members
of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association since May, when the union's
contract expired. Hardest hit include Peabody Coal, subsidiary of UK-based
Hanson, and Consol Energy, owned by Rheinbraun of Germany and DuPont, the US
chemical company.
Most of the affected mines produce high-sulphur coal, a commodity already
under market pressure because of the environmenal constraints of the US
Clean Air Act. The union is seeking guarantees from the coal companies that
its members will be given jobs in new mines in the region.
The coal operators have proposed a complicated formula for awarding some new
jobs to union workers and some to non-union labour.
Union workers, the companies contend, cost more to employ. The companies are
also seeking contract concessions that would give them more workforce
flexibility, according to Mr Tom Hoffman, a BCOA spokesman.
'The union still wants all the jobs at every single new mine that opens,'
said Mr Hoffman, 'and we won't give them that.'

THE CLINTON administration yesterday threw its weight behind a controversial
measure to allow property owners to buy the right to develop protected
wetlands with payments to a fund set up to restore other wetland areas,
writes Lisa Bransten in Washington.
Mitigation banking, as it is known, is part of a plan to protect sensitive
lands that provide a home for over a third of endangered species in the US.
Officials promised no net loss of US wetlands and hoped the plan would end
the stalemate between environmentalist and agricultural and business groups.
Offsetting environmental damage in one area with gains elsewhere is gaining
currency, with companies able to trade air pollution allowances.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUNKEL negotiating text for completing the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks is coming under fire from both business and labour in the US.
Lobbyists are demanding far-reaching changes, and more progress on reducing
tariffs.
The text, prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, proposes compromises based on Gatt
members' positions. In the view of many US companies, it is weighted against
'the world's most open large market' because it would cripple the trade laws
used to protect against 'unfair' practices or to open foreign markets.
Objectors believe the text places too much emphasis on curtailing US trade
laws. They argue greater attention should be paid to controlling dumping,
subsidies and industrial targeting - practices those laws are meant to
address.
The enthusiastic support of US business is vital if a final Uruguay Round
package of reforms - with a notional deadline for agreement of December 15 -
is to overcome protectionist forces in Congress.
The US Chamber of Commerce last week sent Mr John Schmidt, the country's
co-ordinator for multilateral trade negotiations, a document spelling out
what it sees as the draft's 'shortcomings'. High on the list was a complaint
that it 'benefited significantly' the interests of the targets of
anti-dumping investigations while prejucing those of complainants. An
updated report produced by the Labour/Industry Coalition for International
Trade has pinpointed many of the same deficiencies.
The Chamber of Commerce is also pressing for further tariff reductions (it
mentions textiles and electronics), harmonisation of tariffs, and 'vigorous
attempts' to achieve commitments made at this summer's Tokyo summit to cut
peak tariffs in half and other tariffs by at least 33 per cent.

FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Caviar cartel formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIVE caviar-producing countries around the Caspian Sea agreed yesterday
to set up a caviar cartel, according to a report from the Iranian IRNA news
agency, threatening higher prices for one of the world's priciest
delicacies, writes Neil Buckley.
Officials from Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan were
reported to have met in the Iranian port of Bandar Anzali, and agreed to
co-ordinate the global marketing of caviar.
IRNA said member countries would get together to determine an export quota
for each country, and study the possibility of joint exports.
An Iranian official was quoted as saying the agreement was needed to end a
slide in caviar prices since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. But
western caviar importers said last night Russian exporters had been quoting
higher prices for caviar this year, and a cartel might have the effect of
keeping prices at sensible levels.
The Soviet Union, which produced about 250 tonnes of caviar a year, and
Iran, with 100 tonnes, were previously the only exporters - apart from China
which produces about 15 tonnes a year - and fixed prices annually.
The disintegration of the USSR has led to four different countries - Russia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - emerging as exporters.
Lack of centralised regulation has led to over-fishing and damage to caviar
supplies in the Caspian Sea.
There has also been a rise in smuggling of caviar into western Europe.

MR KLAUS KINKEL, German foreign minister, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French
counterpart, yesterday voiced their determination to reach a rapid
settlement of the Uruguay Round.
'We have not solved all the problems, but our determination to find a
solution is stronger than ever,' Mr Juppe told a news conference.
He said Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, would be bringing new
'texts' putting forward French proposals on farm trade liberalisation, when
he came to Bonn for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl tomorrow.
After a day of informal discussions in Dresden, in the east German state of
Saxony, the two foreign ministers underlined the 'excellent' state of
relations between their governments, in spite of the recent upheaval in the
European monetary system, and their continuing differences on the Gatt
negotiations.
Mr Juppe said that France could not accept the extent of cuts in European
Community cereal exports, of between 13m and 17m tonnes a year, agreed in
the EC-US Blair House accord last year.
Underlining efforts to forge a common position, Mr Jochen Borchert, German
agriculture minister, flew to Paris for dinner with Mr Jean Puech, his
French opposite number, last night.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY will tomorrow name the winners of a tender for two concessions to
operate digital mobile telecommunications systems, writes Nicholas Denton in
Budapest.
The successful international consortiums are expected to pay a combined
Dollars 100m (Pounds 150m) for the right to operate networks based on the
pan-European GSM standard over 15 years and to invest a further Dollars 400m
in development over the next 10 years.
Hungary's is the first tender in east-central Europe for GSM mobile phone
services and will set a precedent for Poland and the Czech Republic.
Confident of victory is a group led by US West, the US regional operator,
and HTC, the Hungarian telecommunications monopoly. They are already
partners in Westel, the joint venture operating Hungary's analogue mobile
telephone service.
DBFH, teaming Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, France Telecom and British
Telecom, is also a powerful contender. With a reported Dollars 48m bid for
the rights to one concession, the west European national oper-ators topped
the Dollars 46m offered originally by US West and its partners.
But Deutsche Telekom is a prime contender for the planned privatisation
later this year of a stake of more than 30 per cent in state-owned HTC.
Deutsche Telekom's involvement in the national landline operator could
conflict on competition grounds with participation in digital cellular
telephony.
Deutsche Telekom's divided interest may work to the advantage of Pannon GSM,
a coalition of the Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Dutch state
telecommunications companies. The 'Nordic' group's last bid of Dollars 45m
was only marginally behind the leaders' and the tender evaluation committee
rated the submission's technical quality highly.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Hopes dwindle for US Mars probe

HOPES FOR rescuing the Dollars 980m (Pounds 652m) Mars Observer mission from
failure were dwindling yesterday as US space scientists tried vainly to
re-establish radio contact with the spacecraft.
Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration could do
little but cross their fingers and hope that a fallback programme would
prompt the Mars Observer to call in of its own accord, after their own
efforts to restore communications had produced no result.
However, they said yesterday they believed the spacecraft would
automatically move into orbit, despite their lack of communications.
Nasa engineers had originally switched off the Mars Observer's radio last
week as a precaution when they pressurised its fuel tanks in preparation for
orbit. The radio has not switched back on.
Scientists involved in the mission tried to put a brave face on things,
noting that some of the return on the Dollars 980m investment had already
been achieved through the development of technology for the mission that
could be transferred to other uses.
Nonetheless, the mission seems set to become the latest in a series of
disasters that have severely damaged Nasa's reputation for getting things
done.
Nasa's efforts to explore deep space, from the Hubble space telescope to the
Galileo mission to Jupiter, have been hampered by technical failures.
Its launch programme has also been plagued with problems, with malfunctions
causing repeated delays to the schedule for space shuttle missions.
Other space launchers outside Nasa's aegis have fared no better, with
setbacks including the explosion earlier this month of an Air Force Titan 4
rocket carrying an expensive intelligence satellite.
These problems come at a particularly critical time for Nasa, because of the
intensity of debate in Congress about future funding levels for expensive
programmes such as space exploration.
The space station, redesigned to meet tighter cost constraints, survived by
one vote in the House of Representatives in June, but Congress members
opposed to the station believe there are still other opportunities to kill
the project.

<TEXT>
THE UNITED NATIONS last night appointed a senior investigator to examine
persistent charges of fraud, waste and corruption in the organisation.
Mr Mohamed Aly Niazi, an Egyptian who served for 23 years as a UN internal
auditor before his retirement, will fill the newly-created post of assistant
secretary-general for inspections and investigations.
He is said to be 'obsessed with honesty' and is already running an inquiry
into UN handling of multi-million dollar bids for commercial contracts for
peacekeeping and other services.
Eight officials were suspended recently after suspicions of impropriety in
the award of a contract to a company providing helicopter services for the
UN.
Mrs Madeleine Albright, US delegate, has been pressing for appointment of a
UN inspector-general with wide powers.
That question is expected to be addressed by member states at the general
assembly session beginning next month.
Allegations of mismanagement and lax controls over the UN's world-wide
operations are blamed in part for the US Congress's failure to authorise
payment of Dollars 786m (Pounds 527.5m) in arrears for the regular budget
and peacekeeping.

FT  25 AUG 93 / 'Bidding wars' truce by governors
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GOVERNORS have agreed on a new policy aimed at preventing 'bidding wars'
in their efforts to attract businesses to their states by offering tax
breaks and other incentives.
The policy will not end such competition but officials hope it will mark a
truce and help states to focus on improving their general economic
conditions.
Governor Jim Edgar of Illinois, main author of the policy, said it 'should
restore some sanity to the competition'.
Governors have often come under attack for spending more money and effort
trying to attract new industrial plants than on maintaining sound business
conditions for existing businesses that may have a much better record of
creating local jobs.
The new policy statement from the National Governors' Association, agreed at
a meeting in Oklahoma last week, says that the competition for plant
location 'should not be characterised by how much direct assistance a state
can provide to individual companies'.
Instead, states should be judged on such factors as improvements in
education, transport, telecommunications, general tax policies, business
regulation and the quality of public services.
The announcement of a new industrial plant can trigger a flurry of offers
from states anxious to win the jobs it would bring, ranging from tax
holidays to free land and infrastructure investments.
Mercedes-Benz received offers from more than 30 communities around the US
when it announced it would build a Dollars 300m factory making four-wheel
drive utility vehicles. BMW won an estimated Dollars 71m in land grants and
other incentives from South Carolina when it decided to locate a Dollars
410m plant in Greenville.

ANGLO-German partners AEG and Taylor Woodrow International have won a DM735m
(Pounds 290m) contract for a light railway system in Kuala Lumpur, the
Malaysian capital, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
AEG said yesterday its share amounted to DM320m and comprised orders for the
entire electrical system, signalling, telecommunications, ticket-issuing and
workshop equipment, and 34 units of rolling stock.
Taylor Woodrow, the construction company in charge of the project, will lay
tracks and build stations for the 12km project. On completion, expected in
late 1996, the system will have a maximum passenger capacity of 35,000 an
hour in each direction.
The contract represents a further advance for AEG's rail systems division,
one of the fastest growing units in the Daimler-Benz subsidiary. AEG is due
shortly to make its first direct investment in Chinese railways, in a joint
venture to make carriages for the Shanghai metro. The company made its first
move in Chinese railways in charge of an all-German consortium which set up
and equipped the first stretch of the Shanghai system.

<TEXT>
THE ANGRY resignation of Argentina's interior minister has brought out into
the open a bitter row over President Carlos Menem's drive to amend the
constitution so he can stand for a second term, Reuter reports from Buenos
Aires.
Mr Gustavo Beliz, a 32-year-old lawyer sworn in just nine months ago as a
symbol of clean government, stormed out on Monday after accusing some of Mr
Menem's closest aides of dirty tactics in their campaign to change the
constitution.
Mr Beliz, who has close links to leaders of Argentina's Roman Catholic
church, said in his letter of resignation that unidentified senior officials
were generating 'an unacceptable state of suspicion' by the way in which
they tried to further Mr Menem's goal.
The outgoing minister had also charged in an interview published on the eve
of his resignation that some of Mr Menem's aides were prepared to buy
opposition votes in the 257-seat lower house of parliament, which must
approve by a two-thirds majority any proposal to change the constitution.
Although Mr Beliz never named any of his targets, one of his aides singled
out Mr Eduardo Bauza, Mr Menem's influential chief of staff and his main
political operator.
Mr Menem, who took over from his predecessor Mr Raul Alfonsn at the height
of a bout of hyperinflation in 1989, will have to step down in July 1995 if
he cannot get the constitution changed.
He says his team's success in reining in inflation must be given a further
lease of life with a second term in office.

FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: TAC bows to banks and officials -
Negotiations with BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TAIWAN the business of building aircraft has become too important to be
left to businessmen.
Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), the company set up two years ago by
Taipei to launch one of Asia's leading manufacturing economies into the
commercial aviation industry, is being elbowed aside by the country's banks
and government officials.
Its president and chairman will be replaced within weeks by nominees from
creditor banks, whether or not the protracted talks with its potential
partner, British Aerospace, succeed in establishing a joint venture to build
regional jet aircraft. Although TAC's chairman is taking part in the talks,
the state-owned Chiao Tung Bank, which leads the banking consortium that
plans to lend money to the joint venture, has taken centre stage in the
talks.
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's outgoing president, is not even attending this week's
event though he signed the original joint venture contract with Mr John
Cahill, BAe's chairman, in January. US-educated Mr Ko acknowledges that he
was 'perhaps naive' in believing the fine-tuning of the contract would take
just three months. He says that the Taiwanese establishment tends to regard
him as too pro-western to take any further part.
But he admits the banks have some justification for their unhappiness about
the way the deal has been conducted. 'There was a breakdown in
communications' between TAC and the banks backing the project during the
spring,' he says.
That breakdown led this week to a redrafting of a series of clauses in the
original contract with the intention of assuaging the fears of the banking
consortium members that the joint venture might lose money. Those changes
being negotiated this week are designed to:
Ensure that assets BAe is putting into the joint venture called Avro can be
used as collateral against bank loans. Details of the loans have dominated
talks this week.
Reduce the banks' exposure to risk in the leasing of aircraft - Taiwanese
banks are relatively unfamiliar with leasing.
Determine the nature of a market study that could lead to the production a
new model of aircraft, the RJX.
Strengthen BAe's commitment to transferring design and manufacturing skills
to Taiwan - a senior government official on Monday said the original
contract was 'loose' on the subject.
This last point was underlined yesterday by Taiwan's defence minister, who
was reported to have called for more technology know-how to be transferred
to Taiwan as part of a separate military aircraft deal with Dassault, the
French aircraft maker.
The now sidelined Mr Ko can only watch Taiwan's banking and political
establishment take direct control of the talks, indicating how determined it
is to make Taiwan a force in civil aircraft manufacture. While BAe wants
Asian manufacturing and markets to stem the losses in its regional aircraft
operation, for Taiwan the logic of the deal is more complex and no less
compelling.
The country has a well-developed military aerospace industry that grew out
of its political isolation. In the wake of western countries' recognition in
the early 1970s of the communist government in Beijing, Taiwan was unable to
buy advanced military aircraft from western countries.
In the 1970s it began a programme to develop its own supersonic fighter
aircraft. But just as production got under way last year, France and the US
decided to risk Beijing's wrath by allowing the sale of General Dynamics
F-16 and Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Taiwan.
Taiwan's air force promptly halved its order for the indigenous fighter,
leaving 200-plus local aerospace manufacturers and the design and
manufacturing arm of the defence ministry with spare capacity.
What is unfortunate for BAe, is there is no shortage of western suitors
willing to take work-hungry Taiwanese partners. The Taipei annual aerospace
exhibition, which finished on Sunday, was dominated by huge pavilions of
French and US companies. BAe was represented by a small stand under the name
of Avro.

TALKS between British Aerospace and Taiwanese officials to rescue a proposed
joint venture have spilled over into a third day, write Daniel Green and
Dennis Engbarth in Taipei.
Fourteen hours of meetings yesterday remained mired in the details of how
the aircraft manufacturing venture, called Avro, will be financed.
The deal is central to BAe's strategy to improve its profitability. The RJ
series of regional jet aircraft that would be built partly in Taiwan
currently loses money for the company.
Taiwanese banks want to limit their exposure to the fortunes of Avro. They
are seeking assurances that the assets BAe is putting into Avro - land,
plant and machinery in the UK - qualify as collateral for their loans rather
than loans from UK banks. The Taiwanese cabinet minister involved in the
talks, Mr Chiang Ping-Kun, economic affairs minister, confessed he 'did not
understand' UK banking law on collateral.
Taiwanese law prevents a bank from making unsecured loans to a company in
which it has more than a 3 per cent stake. This limit is exceeded by the
state-owned Chiao Tung Bank, which heads the consortium of lender banks.
Chiao Tung Bank officials will continue their talks with BAe today.
Another team from Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, the joint venture partner,
will address guarantees that aerospace technologies will be transferred to
Taiwan and the conditions under which a new range of aircraft, the RJX,
would be developed.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Zhu heeds foreign advice to slow China's growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ZHU RONGJI, China's vice premier in charge of the economy, acted to slow
the rapid growth of the economy after receiving recommendations from
international advisers whom he called the 'foreign monks'.
The team's involvement in the formulation of economic measures reveals a
remarkable degree of openness to external advice on the part of Mr Zhu.
Mr Zhu's term for the foreigners, according to a participant in meetings
held in China in June, was 'his way of saying that outsiders sometimes have
greater wisdom because they can look at things from the outside'.
The team, mainly from the World Bank but including several other foreign
economists, recommended a package of measures to cool the over-heating
economy at the end of a three-day meeting with Chinese officials at Dalian,
on China's north-eastern coast, from June 10 to 12.
Among their suggestions were increases in interest rates, much tighter
control of the financial system, and curbs on capital spending by local
governments.
Mr Zhu's response was swift. On July 2 he took over as governor of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank. On July 5 he stated that China
'must rectify financial order and strengthen financial discipline'. On July
11 he raised interest rates.
The World Bank team first met Mr Zhu in Beijing. He asked them whether they
believed that the economy was over-heating. When they answered that they
were convinced that it was, he asked them what actions they would advise.
The team then went to Dalian for an annual session with ministers and top
officials of the ministry of finance, the People's Bank and the System
Reform Commission, the agency which is overseeing the re-structuring of the
economy. The team's advice was given at the close of the Dalian conference.
The recommendations, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial
Times, said evidence of overheating was provided by rising inflation and a
widening gap between the official exchange rate and the rate in the 'swap
centres' in which foreign currencies are mainly traded.
'It is clear that the main source of the overheating is excessive fixed
investment growth, facilitated by an accommodating monetary policy,' the
report said.
China's economy grew 13 per cent in 1992 and the annual rate of growth rose
to 14 per cent in the first half of 1993. As the economists and officials
met, inflation was edging over 20 per cent in big cities and the yuan,
China's currency, was weakening as low Chinese interest rates made it
attractive to hold foreign currencies.
Much of the investment in fixed assets - which was rising at a 70 per cent
annual rate in the first half of 1993 - was by local governments which
rushed, with the help of ill-advised lending, to establish property and
industrial schemes.
Mr Zhu has cracked down both on the lending and on local authorities,
closing down 1,000 locally-declared 'development zones' - though economists
say the total number of zones is much larger than this.
The World Bank already had a close relationship with China. Reforms since
1979 have earned high praise from the bank and exhortations to press ahead.
Reuter adds: The US plans to impose sanctions against China as early as this
week for allegedly exporting sensitive missile technology - the M-11,
capable to delivering a 500kg warhead up to 300km - to Pakistan in breach of
its pledges, a US official said in Washington yesterday.

<TEXT>
CHINA and Vietnam yesterday sought to open a new chapter in their vexed
relations, with their first high-level talks on long-running territorial
disputes, including a row over oil drilling rights in the Tonkin Gulf.
Mr Tang Jiaxuan, China's vice foreign minister, talked of a 'new situation'
in relations between the once close allies, and said that Beijing would
'participate in the negotiations with positive, practical and constructive
attitudes'.
Western officials in Beijing say that while it was important that the
neighbours should have resumed discussions in an apparently cordial
atmosphere, significant barriers remained to an early resolution of disputes
over territory both in the Tonkin Gulf, and in the South China Sea where the
two sides are locked in disagreement over ownership of the Spratly Islands.
Mr Vu Khoan, Vietnam's vice foreign minister, said at a welcoming ceremony
at China's state guest house that the two sides had come together to 'help
resolve various problems left over from history'.
Agreement on this new round of talks was reached during a visit to Hanoi
last December by China's Premier Li Peng. That visit was aimed at
establishing a new basis of trust and understanding after the mutual
antagonism of the recent past.
China, angered by Hanoi's invasion of Cambodia, launched a brief border war
against Vietnam in 1979 which it described at the time as a 'counter attack
in self defence'.
Chinese forces received a 'bloody nose' at the hands of the Vietnamese.
It was not until 1991 that relations were normalised again, but lingering
mistrust delayed the resumption of serious efforts to resolve their
differences.

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan remained equivocal on the state of the domestic economy
yesterday, proclaiming in its latest monthly review that 'Japan's recession
seems to be coming to an end', but adding that imminent recovery was not in
sight.
The central bank's assessment was echoed by the economic planning agency,
which said its index of current economic conditions was negative in June for
the second successive month. A revival hung in the balance, it added.
After positive scores on its so-called coincident diffusion index for the
three months to April, the EPA in mid-year announced that the economy had
bottomed out.
Officials have since attempted to cling to this forecast and brush off fears
of a double-dip, while acknowledging that conditions are not improving.
The index reading stayed at 10.0 in June, the same level as in May and down
from 65.0 in April. The index of leading indicators was 36.4, its fourth
month of decline.
According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, industrial
production in the three months to June was down 1.5 per cent from the first
quarter, hit by a fall in output of consumer durables.
The Bank of Japan said its assessment of latest available data showed
personal spending still weak as a result of a fall in wage-earners' bonuses
and a poor summer. Fixed investment by manufacturers continued to decline
despite de-stocking which had 'virtually run its course'.
It described export demand as firm, particularly from South-East Asia, but
said imports remained stagnant except for foods, textiles and machinery.
The bank intervened in currency markets again yesterday to prop up the
dollar against the yen, the recent rise of which has been hurting export
profitability. The yen closed in Tokyo down Y0.62 at Y103.97.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Hongkong Bank tightens lending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank have tightened
their mortgage lending policy, following the release of government figures
showing the fastest monthly growth in mortgage loans since late 1991.
However, the moves have been seen as largely cosmetic, and unlikely to hold
back a property market which withstood the introduction of a 70 per cent
ceiling on mortgage lending for new properties in November 1991.
The two HSBC group companies yesterday announced guidelines primarily aimed
at curbing property speculation. These included an increased penalty for
mortgage repayment within 12 months of a property purchase, and an end to
loans against properties more than six months before they are ready for
occupation.
Luxury property prices are estimated to have risen by more than 20 per cent
during 1993, and there has been a significant increase in the level of
sales. This has been boosted by an enormous influx of capital from mainland
China, where investors have been looking for a hedge against the weakening
yuan.
According to the Hong Kong government's monetary authority, total
outstanding mortgage lending increased by 2.2 per cent during July, compared
with an average of 1.1 per cent for the previous year. It expects a further
increase during August.
The authority's deputy chief executive, Mr David Carse, yesterday encouraged
the colony's banks to review lending criteria, in the light of the latest
statistics.
Since mortgage lending is arguably the most profitable part of their loan
portfolios, the banks will be anxious to see the property market stabilise
rather than actually fall. Hongkong Bank said it would take a flexible
approach to the new policy.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Beijing seizes financial controls: The World Bank's path to
cooling the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S economy is, in the World Bank's terminology, 'half-reformed'.
Its excesses have to be curbed by a delicate mix of telling people what to
do - as in the old days of central planning - and indirect measures which
rely more on the working of market forces.
Given the complexity of the task, it was not without reason that Mr Zhu
Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy, turned in June to the
World Bank for advice on how to deal with the extraordinary boom which had
resulted from the most recent round of market-oriented reforms.
China has long respected the bank's advice. Mr Zhu's direct request to a
team of visiting economists for assistance on dealing with an overheated
economy indicated its continuing influence with the Beijing government.
Before taking action to slow growth, however, he wanted to be sure that the
economy was indeed overheating. The response from the World Bank was
unequivocal. According to its annual study completed in June, massive growth
in fixed investment was pushing up prices of raw materials at a rate of
nearly 40 per cent. Real estate and securities prices were rising sharply,
and excess demand was creating bottlenecks in transport and electricity.
'It is clear that the economy is now overheating, and that growth at current
rates is not sustainable,' the bank said. However, it believed swift action
could prevent a 'hard landing' and could maintain economic growth of 8 to 9
per cent - still fast, but below the heady 13 per cent pace of 1992.
For three days in June, a team of its economists - accompanied by a few
foreign economists from outside the bank - conferred with Chinese officials
at Dalian in north-east China on exactly what actions should be taken to
cool the economy while maintaining the pace of reform.
A central theme underlying their recommendations was for the government to
seize control of the financial system and of macroeconomic management, while
not choking off the development of market mechanisms.
At the heart of China's problems, in their view, was the inability of the
central bank, the People's Bank of China, to exert monetary control. There
was little discipline over banks' lending (none at all over non-bank
financial institutions), little use of interest rates as a monetary
instrument and little attention paid to flows of foreign exchange. The
People's Bank was itself increasingly engaged in commercial activities.
A large proportion of the reforms suggested by the team centred around the
issue of financial control.
The People's Bank, they said, should be radically re-structured 'to turn it
into a real central bank'. It should abandon all activities, such as
ownership of securities companies and mutual funds, which were not the
function of a central bank.
Three weeks after the conference at Dalian, Mr Zhu installed himself as
governor of the People's Bank and began the recommended changes.
On monetary policy itself, the foreign advisers suggested an increase of at
least 3 to 5 percentage points in the one-year deposit rate and an even
greater increase in lending rates.
Other interest rates should also rise with the aim of pushing all above the
inflation rate, which had risen to around 14 per cent by the end of the
first half. The previous increase in rates, on May 15, was judged
insufficient and harmful to the banking system because deposit rates were
raised by more than lending rates.
On July 11, one-year deposit rates were increased from 9.18 to 10.98 per
cent, and the lending rate from 9.36 to 10.98 per cent. Three-year
government bond coupons went up from 12.52 to 13.96 per cent. Thus,
longer-term rates have become positive relative to inflation, though not yet
short-term rates.
The economists suggested that rate increases be accompanied by a rigorous
tightening of bank supervision, including a reduction of liquidity through
increased reserve requirements. Credit ceilings should be enforced and
applied to all lending institutions, they said.
They recommended an acceleration of moves towards a unified exchange rate.
The authorities have since intervened in the swap market to bolster the
yuan, encouraging those who had been hoarding foreign currencies in
expectation of further weakness of the yuan to buy the Chinese currency.
The gap between the official and swap market rates has therefore narrowed.
While the measures detailed so far essentially relied upon a market response
which would have the effect of slowing economic growth - such as reduced and
more judicious bank lending - some direct action was also called for.
The effect of official exhortations to faster growth had been to encourage
local governments all over the country to pour money into property and
industrial schemes. They would give preferential tax treatment to such
projects by designating the construction areas as development zones.
Financed by easy lending, these schemes contributed enormously to the
economic boom, commanding huge volumes of raw materials and pushing up their
prices. They also caused a loss of tax revenue, worsening an already large
budget deficit.
This was a sensitive political issue because it involved wresting back to
the centre some control which had been allowed to devolve to local
authorities.
The economists at Dalian said they 'recognise that there will be resistance
to enforcing planning commission controls over investment at the local
level'. But their carefully worded conclusion was that 'a key task for the
central government at the present time is to achieve consensus on the need
for a reduced investment rate'.
The government has since closed many development zones and cracked down on
wasteful or corrupt local plans.
These changes represent only a small part of the World Bank's overall
blueprint for Chinese economic reform. Further deregulation of prices and
trade as well as re-structuring of the tax system, incomes policy, and
state-owned enterprises are all recommended.
The economic boom, however, has focused the urgent attention of both China
and its advisers on the financial system, an area which had so far virtually
escaped reform.
Underlining its importance, the World Bank is to hold further workshops with
Chinese officials next month on reforming the People's Bank and on
re-structuring banks so that they are no longer involved in 'policy lending'
 -state-directed lending for the purpose of subsidising state enterprises,
or the financing of costly long-term development projects.
Although massive hurdles - both economic and political - face China's
economic managers, World Bank economists believe the steps taken so far to
deal with overheating are in the right direction, and they expect more. The
extent to which the desired solutions depend on the market's response,
however, shows how far economic reform in China has already come.

FT  25 AUG 93 / 'Gift' from Babangida leaves Nigerians guessing: A farewell
increase in fuel prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD and PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT FOR the first time, but possibly for the last, General Ibrahim Babangida
yesterday demonstrated his capacity both to surprise Nigerians and keep them
guessing.
Three days before he is scheduled to step down from power, Nigeria's
military leader authorised the introduction of a two-tier price system for
petrol that will have the effect of raising the price ten-fold.
Is the move designed to trigger protests which might turn to violence and
provide a pretext for an extension of the general's strong-arm rule?
Or is it his farewell gift to the new government, due to be sworn in
tomorrow, tackling an issue a civilian government might prefer to avoid?
Whatever his motive, the general has belatedly fulfilled an acid test of any
attempt to put Nigeria's lapsed economic reform programme back on track. Few
issues are so central to recovery as the need to end the massive subsidy of
fuel that saw smuggling to neighbouring states thrive and left many parts of
Nigeria short of petrol - at the official rate, that is.
Under the new system, fuel at the old price of N0.70 a litre (1.8p) will
still be available, but in the coming weeks the number of outlets will be
cut and queues will get longer. More and more drivers will choose to pay a
higher price - N7.50 - for a premium grade petrol rather than queue, so the
theory goes.
And in centres where smuggling has created a shortage, motorists are already
paying a black market price equivalent to the new rate.
Petrol in a country which produces 1.8m barrels of oil a day is not the only
commodity in short supply. Banks have been unable to meet a sudden run on
deposits because of a shortage of bank notes. Cheques are not being
honoured. The Central Bank of Nigeria has rejected calls to print more
notes.
In the absence of reliable data, Nigerian businessmen believe inflation is
running at an annual rate of 70 to 100 per cent, compared with 46 per cent
at the end of 1992.
'In the past three weeks this country has ground to a halt because there is
just no government,' says the managing director of a big industrial group.
'No one wants to hold stock, manufacturing output has dwindled and people
want their money in cash kept under the mattress. Everyone is just waiting
to see what will happen on August 27.'
Managers have put investment decisions on hold. They say planning meetings
are about how to survive through the week. Any business forecasting is
impossible. Fears for safety have stopped truck drivers making journeys
between north and south Nigeria, adding supply problems to the other woes of
Nigerian industry.
More disruption is expected as pro-democracy groups have called three days
of protest from today. The Nigeria Labour Congress, which groups 41
industrial trade unions, has called its members out on strike if Gen
Babangida does not bow out on Friday.
More serious is the threat of Nupeng, the oil workers' union, to do the
same.
'The soldiers have taken arms and ammunition into refineries in
contravention of all international safety regulations,' says Mr Elijah
Okougbo, the deputy general secretary of Nupeng. 'They fear we will sabotage
the oil industry. But we have no guns. Our only weapon is a civil
disobedience campaign to force Babangida to quit the stage.'
Gen Babangida yesterday convened a meeting of the ruling military council to
discuss the composition of the 'interim government' which he says will
succeed him next Friday.
But with 48 hours to go before the handover, the general, who annulled the
June presidential elections, is understood to be having difficulty
convincing a Nigerian of sufficient stature to head the new administration.
Several eminent people are believed to have declined the offer. 'No
self-respecting Nigerian wants to lead a puppet government,' says a banker
in Lagos. 'It will be a government of nonentities, and the economy will
continue to fall to pieces.'
The pro-democracy movement has been fragmented and leaderless since Chief
Moshood Abiola, the presidential candidate robbed of his victory, fled the
country three weeks ago.
Labour protests are unlikely to have much impact outside Lagos, although the
disruption in the oil industry could be serious if Nupeng carries out its
threatened strikes.
Businessmen fear that the new interim government will lack the legitimacy
and authority to solve Nigeria's economic problems. The departing
transitional civilian administration, named by Gen Babangida six months ago
to put Nigeria's faltering economic reform programme back on track, has
wound up in dismal failure.
The country's budget deficit is thought to have reached N22bn (Pounds 582m)
in the first quarter of 1993 - nearing in four months its deficit target for
the year. Chief Ernest Shonekan's administration also failed to reach a
debt-rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club of creditor nations, who are
owed Dollars 16.5bn of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn foreign debt.
Whatever government takes over will inherit an economic crisis; but if the
price rise yesterday is accepted by Nigerians, it will have one less
headache to bear.

FT  25 AUG 93 / New draft of S African constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest draft of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, published
yesterday, provides details for the first time of how executive power will
be shared in the first government, proposing an effective white veto over
areas such as the budget and national security.
The issue of sharing power within the first post-apartheid cabinet has been
the subject of months of bilateral negotiations between the African National
Congress and the government.
Yesterday's draft constitution effectively proposes that Mr Nelson Mandela,
president of the ANC, should be South Africa's president and Mr FW de Klerk,
the current president, the vice or deputy president.
It stipulates that decisions within the cabinet should be taken by a special
majority - yet to be set - and that in matters of budget, finance and
national security, both the president and vice-president would have to
agree. This would give the ruling National party, whose support is expected
to be overwhelmingly white, an effective veto in these matters.
Debate on the draft is due to begin tomorrow.
The draft proposes that parties gain cabinet representation in proportion to
their share of the vote in elections to parliament. It is understood Mr de
Klerk opposes the idea of a deputy presidency, insisting on a more equal
relationship between the leader of the majority party and others within the
coalition. He is also understood to consider the powers granted to the
deputy president insufficient.
The draft constitution also sets out powers for regional governments, with
only very limited areas reserved exclusively for the regions - including
markets and pounds, town planning, roads and public transport  - with powers
over regional taxation, education, health, and policing to be exercised
concurrently with central government. Parties which favour federalism argue
that this gives central government ultimate control over most important
regional functions.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT RICKE, the chairman of Deutsche Telekom, Germany's state-owned
telecommunications group, yesterday pleaded for urgent political support for
early privatisation of the company.
'There is not much time left . . . (before) the emergence of fully
liberalised markets and ever stiffer competition,' Mr Ricke said, referring
to the European Commission's decision to liberalise basic voice telephony
markets in Europe by 1998.
Mr Ricke told a news conference that Deutsche Telekom faced an uphill
struggle trying to increase its competitiveness because of its status as a
public company. It is legally required to transfer the bulk of its profits
to the state budget each year and to cover the ever-growing deficits of the
German post and postal bank.
'We have made enormous progress toward increasing our competitiveness,' he
said. 'However, we are not able, on our own, to implement all the measures
that have now become urgently required . . . It is therefore imperative that
public policy lead to a joint-stock corporation which can trade its shares
on the stock market.'
MPs this autumn will debate a controversial privatisation bill which emerged
after two years of wrangling between Germany's political parties. The bill
has won the support of the leadership of the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD), but it still needs backing from ordinary SPD MPs.
If adopted, the bill would allow Deutsche Telekom to sell a first tranche of
shares on the stock exchange by 1996 or 1997. It would would also be able to
keep its profits.
Mr Ricke said the first tranche of shares would amount to DM15bn (Pounds
5.8bn). He also warned that Deutsche Telekom could not continue to subsidise
the postal system at the same time as rebuilding the telecommunications
infrastructure in eastern Germany and preparing for increased competition.
Revenues this year are expected to reach DM58bn from DM54bn in 1992. Last
year the company had to transfer DM6.5bn of its DM7bn profit to the federal
and postal budgets. 'The political decision-making bodies must ensure that
our enterprise can continue at an accelerated pace,' Mr Ricke said.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Bundesbank discount rate cut expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief economists at Germany's 12 biggest banks all expect the Bundesbank
to cut its leading lending rate this week, even though conditions have
failed to improve since the central bank's last meeting at the end of July.
Nine of the dozen questioned in a poll, which closed last Friday, said they
expected a reduction of half a percentage point in the key discount rate,
currently at 6.75 per cent.
However, inflation is still stuck above 4 per cent, according to the latest
indications, while money supply growth seems likely to remain well above the
central bank's target range for some months yet.
The cost-of-living index in Baden-Wurttemberg edged up 0.1 per cent in the
month to mid-August, state officials reported yesterday. This brought the
year-on-year increase in the most prosperous state to 4.3 per cent, compared
with 4.2 per cent in July.
New money supply figures are not expected this week, but the effects of
heavy buying of weak currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism  -
before the widening of fluctuation bands three weeks ago - are expected to
drive the annualised growth rate in the M3 measure above July's 7.5 per
cent.
The bank's target range for this year allows for growth between 4.5 per cent
and 6.5 per cent.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president-elect, dropped mild hints last
weekend when he said small rate cuts were possible provided the trend in the
money stock permitted them and inflation declined slightly in the near
future.
Observers suggested the bank could justify a drop in the discount rate
tomorrow if it filtered out the distorting effects of money market
interventions on M3.
The policy council has also recently shown itself to be more interested in
short-term inflation trends than in the conventional figures.
According to informal analyses, the annualised rate for the past three
months could be as low as 3 per cent in August compared with 3.4 per cent in
July.
However, non-German economists suggested a rate cut this week was unlikely
because fundamental conditions had not changed in the past month, and that
international pressure had eased greatly since the widening of ERM
fluctuation bands.
The Bundesbank's announcement yesterday of a fixed-rate offering of
securities repurchase agreements at an unchanged 6.80 per cent gave no clues
to its intentions for Thursday, analysts said.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Kohl party draws up EC reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for radical reforms of the main institutions of the European
Community, including new rules for majority voting in the council of
ministers, have been drawn up in Germany in a fresh attempt to create a
streamlined, less bureaucratic European union.
The parliamentary leaders of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats
yesterday approved a blueprint for German foreign policy, clearly
identifying their national interest with European integration - leaving an
open door for the democratic states of eastern Europe eventually to join the
EC.
They also spelt out the need for institutional reform of the EC, to ensure
that an enlarged Community, with 16 or more members, remains capable of
decisions.
Their ideas may form the basis of a German government initiative to maintain
the momentum towards European integration, just when doubts about economic
and monetary union, and the Maastricht process, are spreading.
Germany wants the new institutional reforms to be discussed at October's
extraordinary EC summit to celebrate ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
The proposals drafted by Mr Karl Lamers, CDU parliamwentary foreign affairs
spokesman, include:
a 'double-majority' voting system in the council of ministers requiring both
a majority of member states and a majority of their populations to take
decisions;
a maximum 10-member European Commission, to be selected by the Commission
president from nominees by the member states, and approved by both European
parliament and the council of ministers; there are currently 16
commissioners, two for each of the four larger member states and one each
for the remaining eight;
a new rotation of member states holding the council of ministers presidency,
scrapping the alphabetical system, and leaving it up to member states to
nominate large and small states alternately;
a ceiling on membership of the European parliament, regardless of the number
of member states, to prevent it becoming too unwieldy;
possible creation of a 'senate' representing national parliaments directly,
in a sort of upper house of the elected parliament.
The plans meet the need for new thinking on institutional reforms to
maintain the decision-making balance of the EC, between the large member
states and the smaller ones. Enlargement to 16 member states will upset that
balance.

A Czech police chief yesterday denied his country had become 'a breeding
ground for organised crime', writes Patrick Blum in Prague.
Mr Josef Doucha, deputy director of the Czech central criminal police,
angrily rejected press reports suggesting Prague had become a centre for
international criminal groups after the collapse of communism. There had
been no 'sudden eruption of crime', but he admitted drug smuggling had grown
because the Balkan drug route from Afghanistan and Pakistan through Turkey
and the Balkans and into western Europe had been disrupted by war in the
former Yugoslavia. As a result the Czech Republic had become a transit
route.

Italy's ex-Communists, who have escaped relatively unscathed from the
country's bribery scandal, yesterday became embroiled when the party's
treasurer was warned he was under investigation, Reuter reports from Milan.
Mr Marcello Stefanini, a senator, was told by magistrates he was being
investigated in an inquiry into bribes paid by a building company. However,
the Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communist party, immediately
denied the senator had anything to do with the alleged bribes.

The United Nations Security Council decided yesterday to establish a UN
observer mission in Georgia, comprising up to 88 military observers plus
minimal support staff, Reuter reports from New York. It will be the first
team the UN has sent to any of the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general, recommended recently that the
mission be set up to monitor compliance with the July 27 ceasefire agreement
between the government of Georgia and Abkhazian rebels.

SWEDISH police said yesterday they had arrested three Russians and a Swede,
armed with pistols and a hand grenade, on suspicion of planning to kidnap Mr
Peter Wallenberg, senior member of the powerful Wallenberg industrial
dynasty, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
Police said the men were seized outside the gates of Mr Wallenberg's mansion
on the forested island of Varmdo, near Stockholm, on Monday evening.
Officials said they believed the men intended kidnapping Mr Wallenberg, 67,
for ransom.
They did not get close to the industrialist. High-profile Swedes, previously
relaxed about security, have tightened precautions since the assassination
by a still unknown gunman in 1986 of the former prime minister, Mr Olaf
Palme.
Mr Wallenberg heads a family which founded much of Sweden's industrial base
and holds large shareholdings in leading companies such as Ericsson, the
telecommunications group, Astra, the pharmaceuticals giant, Stora, Europe's
biggest forestry products company, and Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aircraft
maker.
He is a relative of the wartime diplomatic hero, Raoul Wallenberg, who died
in prison in Moscow in 1947.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Hague court to hear genocide allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Court of Justice in the Hague will consider today Bosnian
accusations that Serbs have been carrying out a campaign of territorial
expansion through 'ethnic cleansing' and genocide.
A similar application by the Bosnians four months ago resulted in a court
order to stop the genocide.
Legal officials in The Hague say a decision on the case is unlikely for
several days, not least because the court will simultaneously be considering
similar accusations from Serbia of genocide carried out by Moslems.
But though few expect the ruling to carry much weight with the forces on the
ground, the hearing is likely to fuel a wider diplomatic debate over
attempts to bring legal retribution to bear in Bosnia.
Next month the United Nations general assembly is expected to name 11 judges
who will sit on the UN war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia.
Meanwhile, in a separate move, the International Red Cross (ICRC) has called
a conference in Geneva on August 30 to discuss the treatment of war victims.
The organisers claim the conference has been called to raise awareness of
the Geneva conventions, with participants expected from more than 100
countries.
But ironically, the ICRC's tradition of neutrality has left it refusing to
co-operate with UN investigators seeking evidence of war crimes.
With other European governments increasingly reluctant to dwell too much on
the issue - particularly when the west is pressing adoption of a peace plan
 -there are fears at the UN war crimes council, formed seven months ago to
collect information on war crimes, that attempts to build a case could
ultimately be undermined by a reluctance to submit evidence.

<TEXT>
A CZECH police chief yesterday denied his country had become 'a breeding
ground for organised crime' and said it faced the same problems as other
European countries in fighting drugs trafficking, the illegal arms trade,
and other crime.
Mr Josef Doucha, deputy director of the Czech central criminal police,
angrily rejected press reports suggesting Prague had become a centre for
international criminal groups after the collapse of communism. There had
been no 'sudden eruption of crime', though the Czech capital's geographical
position put it in the middle of new east-west crime routes, he told CTK,
the Czech news agency.
Drug smuggling had grown because the Balkan drug route from Afghanistan and
Pakistan through Turkey and the Balkans and into western Europe had been
disrupted by war in the former Yugoslavia. As a result the Czech Republic
had become a transit route for drugs.
The illegal arms trade was also worrying. The Czech Republic produced good
weapons and there were large quantities of old Semtex explosive -
manufactured before last year's requirement that it be made easily
detectable - in circulation. But Czech police lacked resources and
experience in fighting organised crime.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly one in four claims on property confiscated by the Nazis, or the
Communist regime in eastern Germany, have been resolved since late 1990,
writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. However, officials from the federal office
responsible for the cases yesterday said it would take a decade before all
outstanding claims were settled.
The claims, which relate to property confiscated between 1933 and 1945, and
between 1949 and 1990, total 1.21m, and involve 2.63m titles to property
ranging from large enterprises to small businesses, land and houses. Their
uncertain status is seen by economists as hindering investment in the
region.
From late 1990 until the end of June 1993, 28 per cent of the claims on
130,000 enterprises, including agricultural land, were resolved, while 24
per cent of the remaining 2.52m titles were also settled.

FT  25 AUG 93 / The land issue that divides a united Germany: Those who are
challenging the 1990 unification treaty's rule that they cannot get their
property back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL OVER the world there are families who can recount stories of legendary
battles over land: how one son was favoured over another; how siblings
refused to talk to each other after a parent's will carved up property; or
how one child got nothing.
In the re-united German family, a growing controversy over whether property
should be returned to its former owners is generating its own legends.
When Soviet forces occupied eastern Germany in 1945, about 14,000 families
farming 13,000 sq miles were ordered to leave their properties within 48
hours. Some were imprisoned on the island labour camp of Rugen, in the
Baltic Sea. Others had to keep a 20-mile distance from their properties.
Most fled to western Germany, and were compensated in the 1950s.
Three years ago the unification treaty created one nation out of the two
Germanys. On property questions, the treaty states that 'expropriations on
the basis of Occupation Law (when the Soviets occupied eastern Germany
between 1945-1949) are irreversible'.
This means that former property owners during this period cannot get their
land back - unlike those who can seek restitution or compensation for
property confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990.
Through the federal constitutional court, several former landowners
challenged the unification treaty's restrictive clauses on 1945-1949 on the
basis that property was not being treated equally before the law. But the
court upheld the treaty on the grounds that the Soviet Union and the former
German Democratic Republic had made the ban on restitution a precondition
for unification.
'This is absolute nonsense,' said one constitutional lawyer. 'Those who are
seeking to have their property returned to them can prove that no such
precondition existed,' he added.
Lawyers claim that documents recently obtained from Moscow show that the
Soviet government never specifically made unification contingent on the
1945-49 land issue.
They say the word of the then West German government is the only evidence to
support this view.
'On the one hand, passing the buck to the Soviet Union was a convenient
attempt by the Bonn government to avoid paying compensation to former
landowners. On the other, (Lothar) de Maiziere (the last prime minister of
East Germany), was able to prevent 'the Junkers', or landed gentry, from
coming back,' the lawyer said.
The ruling by the constitutional court, however, has not discouraged an
unlikely cross-section of individuals and institutions from challenging
Bonn's interpretation of the treaty. They include the Dutch government,
Daimler-Benz, the Duke of Saxony-Anhalt and a German lawyer. Each claim a
legal right to restitution or substantial compensation.
The Dutch government, which is acting on behalf of three families, is
arguing that land owned by foreigners could not have been nationalised or
expropriated by the Soviet authorities during this time.
'Under the Allied Control Council, property owned by foreigners could not be
sold or expropriated or property rights transferred,' said a Dutch diplomat.
For years, Dutch government tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the
former East German regime the return of this land to its original owners.
Dutch diplomats thought the matter would be quickly resolved after
unification. But after two 'verbal notes' to the foreign ministry in Bonn,
the Dutch government has still been unable to get the property back.
'Bonn says we have to be patient. It has to work out the legal aspects,' a
Dutch diplomat said. 'We said OK. But a solution which does not return the
property, or grant compensation, is unacceptable to us,' he added.
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial holding, had huge investments and
property in the former East Germany. It is now arguing that it has a right
to reclaim this property.
'We will claim about 14m sq yards of land throughout eastern Germany,' the
company said. 'We are doing it on behalf of our shareholders.'
The Prince of Saxony-Anhalt, who is the great great grand nephew of
Catherine the Great, is also trying to reclaim his property of more than
24,700 acres.
And Mr Albrecht Wendenburg, a lawyer who has no aristocratic, industrial, or
diplomatic connections, is also trying to reclaim his small holdings in
eastern Germany.
'People have this view that those whose property was expropriated between
1945-1949, were either raving Nazis, or else they want the property back so
that they can kick out the present owners,' said Mr Wendenburg.
'We are trying to establish the principle of justice and truth: that
property should be treated equally before the law, and that it was Bonn, not
the Soviet Union, which chose to ban any restitution,' he added.
Constitutional lawyers believe that Bonn may be forced to make concessions.
'This problem will not go away. The belief that it was the two German
governments, and not the Soviet Union, which decided on this ban on
restitution is gaining momentum. Until this matter is settled once and for
all, property rights in eastern Germany will never be satisfactorily
resolved, and investors will always be cautious,' a lawyer said.

<TEXT>
JOHN WALKER, who was the Financial Times correspondent in Stockholm from
1963 to 1974 and continued to contribute to the paper for another eight
years, died in Stockholm on August 11, aged 72.
He had three great enthusiasms in life: the Financial Times, vintage cars,
about which he was an expert, and fishing. In London, where he was a
freelance journalist and worked in public relations before joining the FT,
he was the proud owner of a vintage Bentley, which, however, did not follow
him to Stockholm.
He joined the paper at a time when its foreign coverage was expanding
rapidly and he pioneered the development of the extensive coverage of
Swedish - and Nordic - business on which his successors in Stockholm have
built.
He used to say that it was his love of fishing which led to his job with the
FT. It was an enthusiasm he shared with the editor of the paper at the time,
Sir Gordon Newton, who recruited him. Sweden, with its many fast-flowing
rivers and the Stockholm archipelago at his doorstep, was an ideal posting
for him.
He was forced into partial retirement in 1974 by the onset of Parkinson's
disease, but he continued to work part-time and to file to the paper until
1982.
John Walker was born in Sandgate, Kent, on November 11, 1920, went to school
in Dover and served as an officer in the Royal Air Force during the second
world war.
He was nursed through his long illness by his Swedish wife, Ann, who
survives him. He has a son, Peter, by his first marriage.

NORWEGIAN opposition to European Community membership has risen in the
run-up to next month's parliamentary elections, a Gallup poll published
yesterday shows. Some 47.1 per cent of those questioned oppose membership, a
rise of 1.8 percentage points in one week.
The poll, which surveyed 1,000 Norwegians, put support of membership at 28.3
per cent, a decline of 1.2 percentage points, while 24.6 per cent were
undecided.
Norwegian membership in the EC is the main issue in the September 13
elections. The electorate narrowly rejected joining the EC in 1972, but
Brussels and Oslo began fresh negotiations last April and a new Norwegian
referendum could be held in 1995.
The poll, in the Conservative newspaper Aftenposten one week after the
campaign started, showed popularity of the pro-EC Conservative party down
2.9 percentage points to 20.3 per cent. The ruling Labour party, whose
minority government applied for EC membership, advanced 1.2 percentage
points to 32.8 per cent.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Russia 'too kind' to Lithuania on troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA said yesterday it had been 'too kind' towards Lithuania in agreeing a
troop withdrawal timetable before signing a formal treaty on the pull-out.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister, said Russia had decided not to
meet an August 31 deadline for completing the troop withdrawal after
Lithuania turned up at weekend negotiations, which had been expected to
conclude the treaty, with a new demand that Russia make amends for five
decades of Soviet rule.
'We have shown perhaps excessive kindness to Lithuania for which we are
perhaps now having to pay,' he said.
Some western diplomats suggested that in demanding the new concessions,
Lithuania wanted to exploit a US congressional amendment tying a speedy
Russian military withdrawal from the Baltics to US aid to Russia.
Although Mr Churkin did not mention this, Russia is clearly anxious to avoid
being put in a position of appearing to be under US pressure. Nor does it
want to apologise for Lithuania's annexation by the Soviet Union, saying
Russia was also a victim of the Soviet system of which it was the main
component.
The original formal treaty stipulated that Russia would compensate Lithuania
only for material damage caused in the course of the withdrawal and possibly
also for damage incurred after January 1992, when Russia declared itself the
successor state to the Soviet Union.
It was also to transfer some former Soviet army equipment to Lithuania's
newly-formed defence forces.
Mr Churkin said that the harshness of a statement telling Lithuania that
Moscow would now pull out at a time convenient to itself was designed to
discourage neighbouring Latvia and Estonia from also demanding compensation
for Soviet actions.
He said he believed the new demands were part of a 'domestic political
struggle'. He pointed to the fact that the Lithuanian delegation was
dominated by officials close to the radical opposition led by the republic's
former leader, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis,
The aim, he said, was to present the more moderate, pro-Russian government
of newly-elected President Algirdas Brazauskas as incapable of standing up
to Moscow.

OPPOSITION to international peace proposals appeared to be mounting in
Bosnia yesterday after leaders of the Moslem-led government lambasted the
proposed plan to divide their republic.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, denounced the proposed map
put forward last week at the Geneva peace talks for 'rewarding the
aggressor, and punishing the victim'. The plan is due to be debated by the
Bosnian assembly later this week.
Speaking on behalf of Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, he said
that it was unlikely that an agreement would be accepted unless there were
big concessions. He cited towns where Moslems had comprised the majority
before the war until Serb forces expelled or killed them.
In an attempt to step up pressure on his Moslem adversaries, Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday reiterated warnings that if the Bosnians
rejected the deal they would face more war. However, Mr Miro Lazovic,
speaker of Bosnia's parliament, dismissed the need to endorse the proposals
by the August 30 deadline set by the international peace envoys, Lord Owen
and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg.
Meanwhile, United Nations' efforts to take an aid convoy into the contested
city of Mostar failed yesterday. Croat forces refused to let the convoy into
the east of the city, where some 55,000 Moslems have been trapped for more
than two months with little food. A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees said that the Croat forces had refused to let the convoy pass
until various demands were met.
However, Croatian radio yesterday reported that when the convoy was due to
set off, Croat forces launched an offensive around Mostar, and seized the
city's hydroelectric plant.
A UN protection forces spokesman in Zagreb said that fighting was continuing
yesterday between Croat and Moslem forces around Mostar, although the UN
could not confirm reports by Serb, Croat and Moslem press agencies that
fighting had flared up again in central Bosnia and other regions.
Amid mounting international outrage over the fate of Mostar, Washington
continued to raise the tone of its warnings to the Croats.
US officials have said that a warning of possible air strikes issued by Nato
applied not only to the Serbs besieging Sarajevo but also to other groups
preventing the delivery of humanitarian relief.

FT  25 AUG 93 / SFO suffers fresh setback as brokers are acquitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday suffered a further setback to its efforts
to prosecute alleged City crimes in the criminal courts with the acquittal
of two stockbrokers accused of trying to deceive the industry's regulators
in order to remain in business.
Mr Andrew Leslie Kent, 46, and Mr Patrick Mahon, 53, were, respectively, the
corporate development manager and managing director of the City firm TC
Coombs. Both had also been charged with conspiracy to defraud and Mr Mahon
was charged with attempting to obtain property by deception.
Dismissing all charges against the two men at Middlesex Guildhall Crown
Court, Judge Clark said: 'This sort of inquiry, in a case where there has
been no financial loss to any individual, would be far better left to the
regulatory jurisdiction of the appropriate bodies, rather than a full blown
criminal trial.'
Judge Clark called the SFO's case speculative, but said: 'I make no possible
criticism of the SFO in this case.' He noted that 'if the SFO had known as
much as they know now they would not have brought the case'. The SFO case
was based on documents supplied by a Swiss bank, Rahn and Bodmer. However,
several months ago, following a judge's order, the bank turned over many
more documents which cast new light.
The judge ordered the prosecution to pay the defendants' costs.
The City's self-regulatory body for the stockbroking industry, at the time
known as The Securities Association, had declined to authorise TC Coombs in
1988 to conduct investment business, on the grounds that it was inadequately
capitalised by the standards set out by regulators.
In late 1988, TC Coombs won the right to conduct investment business but
regulators questioned its capitalisation up until the time the SFO raided
its offices in November 1990. TC Coombs went into liquidation in February
1991.
Both men are considering applying to the Securities and Futures Authority to
re-enter the securities business.
Mr Robert Alun-Jones QC, acting for Mr Kent, said his client would be
pursuing claims against Rahn and Bodmer for defamation and malicious
prosecution. Lawyers for both men said they were also considering whether
they could take action against any regulatory bodies.

US AIRCRAFT late last night began dropping food into the southern Bosnian
city of Mostar, according to US airforce officials.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees had earlier called on the western
allies to organise rapid airdrops of food into the city, where some 55,000
Moslems have been trapped for more than two months. The UN appeal came as
opposition to international peace proposals appeared to be mounting after
leaders of the Moslem-led Bosnian government lambasted the plan to divide
their republic.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, denounced the proposed map
put forward last week at the Geneva peace talks for 'rewarding the
aggressor, and punishing the victim'. The plan is due to be debated by the
Bosnian assembly later this week. Speaking on behalf of Mr Alija
Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, Mr Silajdzic said it was unlikely an
agreement would be accepted unless there were big concessions.
But in an attempt to step up pressure on his Moslem adversaries, the Bosnian
Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, reiterated warnings that if the Bosnians
rejected the deal, they would face more war. However, Mr Miro Lazovic,
speaker of Bosnia's parliament, dismissed the need to endorse the proposals
by the August 30 deadline set by the peace envoys, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg.
Rebel Bosnian Croats also rejected international protectorate status for
Mostar envisaged by the peace plan, instead declaring the city the capital
of a Croat republic. They later weakened their stance, saying they would
accept a two-year EC mandate.
Meanwhile, UN efforts to take an aid convoy into Mostar failed when Croat
forces refused to let it into the east of the city.
In an effort to break the deadlock, the Moslem forces in Mostar, under
pressure from the UN, agreed to an exchange of bodies with the Croats. Under
the agreement, the UN convoy will provide aid to both the Moslem-controlled
east side of Mostar and the Croat-held west side at noon GMT today. The
bodies of nine Croat soldiers will be swapped for those of 15 Moslem dead.
A UN protection forces spokesman in Zagreb said that fighting was continuing
yesterday between Croat and Moslem forces around Mostar.
Amid mounting outrage over the fate of Mostar, Washington continued to raise
the tone of its warnings to the Croats. US officials have said the air
strike warning issued by Nato applied not only to Serbs besieging Sarajevo
but to other groups preventing delivery of aid.

FT  25 AUG 93 / IBM plan to clone microchip may spark legal row

THE computer industry in the US is facing the prospect of a battle of its
giants after moves by International Business Machines to clone a version of
Intel's top-selling microprocessor chip.
The IBM plan threatens one of the industry's longest-lasting technology
partnerships.
IBM, a conservative company normally, is becoming more aggressive in its
efforts to restore profitability since the arrival of Mr Lou Gerstner as
chairman and chief executive in April.
Intel, meanwhile, has become the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer
largely because of the success of its microprocessors, which were chosen by
IBM as the brains of its first personal computers more than a decade ago.
Since then the Intel chips have become the standard for all 'IBM-compatible'
PCs.
Yet while Intel has earned record profits from its microprocessors, IBM's PC
business operated for several years at a loss and only recently achieved a
'very small' quarterly profit.
For IBM, cloning the Intel chips seems to represent an attempt to take
control of its own destiny and to boost the profitability of its PC
business.
IBM declined to comment on its decision. However, the company is believed to
have efforts under way to produce 'clean room' versions of Intel's 486 and
new high-performance Pentium microprocessors.
The 'clean room' approach, which has been used by other chip companies to
produce Intel microprocessor 'work-alikes', involves isolating designers
from any access to Intel technology so that they must start from scratch to
create a chip that emulates the functions of the original.
Yet Intel has raised legal challenges to all other efforts to clone its
microprocessors. Mr Tom Dunlap, Intel general counsel, has said in the past
that he does not believe it is possible for any company legally to clone
Intel's chips.
The IBM cloning effort is believed to be in its early stages, and industry
analysts point out that, like any development project, it is not certain to
lead to the release of products.
However, if IBM pursues the project it runs the risk of a legal challenge
from Intel, one of its main chip suppliers. IBM is also Intel's largest
customer. This partnership has given IBM unprecedented access to Intel's
technology. Indeed, IBM is licensed, by Intel, to produce Intel-designed
microprocessors. However, the terms of the licensing arrangement restrict
IBM to selling these chips only as components of personal computers or
circuit boards.
Yesterday both Intel and IBM maintained that their relationship remained
'strong and very positive'. But it is clear that most of the benefits of the
relationship accrue to Intel.

FT  25 AUG 93 / Portillo hopes for future tax cut: Treasury secretary
stresses government's need to establish sound finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL PORTILLO, the chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday said the
government planned to go into the next general election holding out the
prospect of tax cuts.
But this could only be achieved by cutting the existing level of government
borrowing and establishing sound finances.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Portillo did not rule out tax
increases in the November 30 Budget as part of a strategy to bring the
state's finances into order.
With tax and spending policy an increasingly contentious issue within the
Tory party, the chief secretary cautioned against optimism that this year's
public sector borrowing requirement would be less than the Pounds 50bn
forecast in the March Budget.
Rightwing Tory MPs have been warning the government against tax increases in
the Budget and urging spending cuts.
But yesterday Mr Portillo, who is one of the remaining rightwing members of
the cabinet, underlined that it would be extremely difficult to keep public
expenditure within the limits already fixed.
He said it was 'essential for the Conservative government to go into the
next election with a reputation for sound public finance and in a position
where it can explain that it has the public finances in a state where it can
plausibly show the path to a low-tax economy'.
'To put ourselves in the best position either to cut taxes or to hold out
the prospect of cutting taxes, we need to make sure that borrowing is
reducing at a fast enough rate,' he said.
The government might have done enough already to achieve this, but it would
have to review the situation in the autumn. Its fundamental principle had to
be the maintainance of sound public finances and its 'first port of call' in
achieving this must be public spending constraint.
Sound finances would flow from 'a combination of recovery, public spending
restraint and some amount of revenue-raising'. Mr Portillo stressed the
difficulties facing the government in holding down public spending.
He also warned that the Treasury had already 'factored in' economic recovery
into its estimates of the PSBR during the years ahead.
'If the recovery is stronger than we anticipated, then public borrowing will
come down a little bit faster,' he said. 'But on any scenario, we are going
to be borrowing rather large sums of money for rather a long period of time.
I'm looking at an increase of our debt service burden of about Pounds 10bn
over the next four years. And that is money that cannot be spent on
programmes.'
Mr Portillo was concerned that critics inside the Conservative party
underestimated the government's task of aiming to hold to the 'control
totals' of Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn that it set a year ago for
public spending in 1994-95 and 1995-95 respectively.
Mr Portillo said the government could not take comfort from Britain's
better-than-expected inflation performance. 'For the time being, we would
expect inflation in the years ahead to be a little higher than we expected
in July 1992 (when the control totals were set) because of the loss of value
in the currency' since the departure of sterling from the European exchange
rate mechanism last September.
Nor was he lulled into complacency by last month's better than expected
public sector borrowing figures which have prompted many City analysts to
pitch their expectations of the PSBR below the Pounds 50bn envisaged by the
government for this financial year and the Pounds 44bn forecast for 1994-95.

Consumer confidence in the health of the economy has risen sharply,
according to the latest survey by Gallup.
Thirty-four per cent of respondents were optimistic about growth while 28
per cent were pessimistic. The positive balance of 6 per cent is 11 points
up on the previous month and stems from brighter expectations about jobs.
There is a growing belief that unemployment has stopped rising.
Low interest rates and a buoyant stock market also gave a further boost to
unit trust sales in July.
A net Pounds 948m flowed in and funds under management reached a record
Pounds 78.8bn, up from Pounds 76.3bn at the end of June.

FT  24 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Holmes recovery hits setback
with tumble to Dollars 133,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 25th August 1993) appended to this article.
HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group quoted in the UK, suffered a
setback to its recovery in the six months to June 30, when pre-tax profits
fell from Dollars 1.47m to Dollars 133,000 (Pounds 89,000).
Mr Richard Hickson, chief executive since Mr Eric Kohn resigned in May, said
the reorganisation of the group had involved the 'clean-up of both its
balance sheet and its operations'.
The former - it had been necessary to clear the Dollars 73m of debt built up
in the acquisitive 1980s and had resulted in the note-holding banks now
controlling 53 per cent of Holmes' equity - had been achieved, he said,
though it had taken longer than anticipated. This in turn delayed the
progress of the latter, which is now only two thirds complete.
Mr Hickson said that both he and Mr Kohn had been cautious not to repeat
Holmes' old mistakes. Therefore there had been a delay in the intended
programme of acquisition of subscriber monitoring contracts. The rate of
subscriber cancellations had fallen 79 per cent year-on-year in the first
half, and was the lowest since 1986.
Group turnover slipped to Dollars 27m (Dollars 28.3m), of which monitoring
and service of alarm systems contributed Dollars 20.6m (Dollars 21.5m). Net
operating costs rose to Dollars 13.6m (Dollars 12.4m). Mr Hickson said that
Holmes had been spending 'general and administration' money on its European
strategy, with little to show for it. While Holmes Protection in the UK was
still operating, activities on the Continent have now been delayed.
Interest costs rose to Dollars 262,000 (Dollars 195,000) as debt rose to
Dollars 5m (Dollars 1.5m) at the period-end. Holmes was forced to borrow
from its bank when in March it had to cancel a share placing, after an
investor, thought to be Faisal Finance (Switzerland), failed to honour its
agreement to pay for 1m shares. Legal proceedings continue in Switzerland.
Earnings were 0.1 cents (3.3 cents) per share.
CORRECTION
The investor who failed to honour an agreement to buy 1m shares in a Holmes
Protection placing was not Faisal Finance (Switzerland) as suggested in
yesterday's edition. Holmes and Faisal, a Holmes shareholder, said yesterday
that their relationship was harmonious. We apologise for the error.

provisions double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIKUBEN, Denmark's third-largest bank, reported a first-half pre-tax profit
of DKr207m (Dollars 30m) compared with a loss of DKr442m in the same period
last year.
The bank returned to profit despite a doubling of loss provisions to
DKr1.68bn from DKr781m, which Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, the bank's chief
executive officer, described as reflecting 'the culmination of a series of
the economic difficulties which have hit Danish business in recent years'.
The bank has become involved in a legal dispute over the interest formula on
Dollars 50m in subordinated loan capital subscribed to Bikuben by the Danish
dairy group, MD Foods. As a consequence, the bank has decided not to include
the loan in the capital base at the half-year, which nevertheless left the
bank with a capital adequacy ratio of 10.5 per cent.
The main contribution to the improvement in the bank's performance in the
first half was a DKr784m gain from the value adjustment of the securities
portfolio.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Poland warned over gas pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S sovereignty could be endangered by a proposed plan that would
supply Russian natural gas to the country along an east-west pipeline, Mr
Jan Olszewski, a former prime minister, warned yesterday.
Mr Olszewski was speaking on the eve of a two-day visit to Poland by the
Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin. During the visit an agreement to build
the pipeline is expected to be signed.
Mr Olszewski, whose right-wing Coalition for the Republic is one of more
than a dozen political groups contesting parliamentary elections scheduled
for September 19, contended that the pipeline would 'nullify chances of
obtaining gas from other sources such as the North Sea'.
Russia currently exports 6.5bn cubic metres a year of natural gas to Poland,
whose domestic production amounts to 3.5bn cubic metres a year.
Estimates of Poland's natural gas needs in the year 2010 assume that
consumption will treble from present levels. The pipeline would carry 67bn
cubic metres a year 4,000km from the Jamal Peninsula in the Arctic Circle to
western Europe.
Details of financing of the project have still to be divulged, but Poland
could take delivery of 14bn cubic metres a year of gas as part of the
agreement.
The Polish sector of the pipeline would be owned by a joint Polish-Russian
operating company. The issue of ownership has been the subject of debate by
critics of the project.
The state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Company has been negotiating the pipeline
agreement with Gazprom, its counterpart in Russia.
The Polish company has also been exploring the possibilities of building a
pipeline linking North Sea gas deposits with Poland's Baltic coast to bring
in a further 10bn cubic metres a year.

policy on alcohol - Monopoly issue complicates EC membership talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the European Commission told Sweden that it must scrap its alcohol
monopoly, it brought to the fore one of the most sensitive and difficult
issues in the Nordic countries' EC membership talks.
Sweden, Norway and Finland have operated Europe's most restrictive alcohol
regime for much of this century and none shows any sign of giving up the
policy without a fight.
The EC says the restrictions have to go because they conflict with rules on
free movement of goods and non-discrimination. For the Nordic countries, it
is a case of public health, for the EC it is one of competition.
The issue could have a decisive impact on whether the Nordic countries can
get their membership applications approved by referendum. Sweden and Norway
each have more than half a million supporters of the temperance movement; if
mobilised, this could be sufficient to swing an otherwise close vote against
membership if the EC line prevails.
Puritan attitudes to alcohol date back to the 18th and 19th centuries when
heavy drinking was rife. Both Norway and Finland had a spell on prohibition
earlier this century, before their current monopolies evolved. The aim today
in all three countries is to discourage alcohol consumption by maintaining
high prices and limiting availability.
Public opinion on the issue is split. A poll in Sweden last week found that
43 per cent of the public wanted the alcohol monopoly retained; a recent
Norwegian study said as many as 59 per cent backed the current regime.
Norway and Sweden are taking the strongest line in the EC talks, saying that
they want to retain monopolies over both imports and retail sales of
alcohol. Attitudes are more relaxed in Finland, which has indicated that it
considers retention of the retail monopoly to be the important issue.
The Commission does not dispute the Nordics' contention that their policies
have cut alcohol-related problems - meaning everything from liver cirrhosis
to drunken driving and violence in the streets.
But it says they can find ways of meeting their health objectives without
retaining a formal monopoly. That could be through taxes, licensing,
advertising, better information, and restrictions on sales to young people,
for example.
Sweden counters by saying it is already doing much of what the commission
recommends. It argues that it should be allowed to adjust its monopoly in so
far as it transgresses EC competition rules, but that public health
arguments should outweigh any requirement to scrap the monopoly.
As part of this emphasis on adjustment, Systembolaget, the Swedish monopoly
retailer, is about to widen its selection of imported brands to demonstrate
that the country's alcohol monopoly is not about favouring domestic
suppliers.
Moves such as this may not be sufficient to win the argument. The Nordic
countries still have to persuade a sceptical European Commission that the
nanny state should have the right to dictate people's drinking habits. And
they have to address evidence that actual levels of drinking are much higher
than official statistics suggest.
According to Norwegian estimates, the country's spirits consumption is
doubled if duty-frees, smuggling and home-distilling are taken into account.
It is difficult to see how a satisfactory solution can be worked out, given
the weight of tradition and long-standing policy on the Nordic side, and the
EC's intransigence towards monopolies on the other.
One answer could be to scrap the import monopoly and agree to phase out the
distribution monopoly over a number of years. But Swedish politicians, at
least, fear they will not be able to sell that to the temperance lobby. They
say alcohol is one of the issues on which the EC has to show increased
flexibility if Swedes are not to get a negative view of membership.
One Swedish politician comments: 'It will be far better for the monopoly to
disappear naturally, with prices coming down as import restrictions
disappear, than if it is forced on us politically. People will see it as a
classic case of unwarranted meddling by Brussels in our internal affairs.'

<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence dropped to record lows in the European Community in
June, after slight signs of recovery the previous month, the European
Commission said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The drop took the EC's measure of consumer confidence back to the level
recorded in March and April.
'The loss of confidence is particularly discernible in Spain, Italy and
Portugal,' the Commission said, adding that Spain and Portugal recording new
lows.
'Taking the average for the Community, consumers view their current and
future financial situations more pessimistically in June than in previous
months.
'They are even more sceptical about the general economic situation: well
over half were of the opinion that the situation had deteriorated further in
June compared with the same month last year.'
The Commission said there was also a distinct absence of cheer from
consumers looking at the next 12 months.
As a result of recession, industry, too, saw the future as gloomier, the
Commission said.
The leading economic indicator for the European Community also dipped to a
record low in June after a slight rise in May, losing 0.5 of an index point
to 95.6, the Commission said. The previous record low of 95.7 was set in
March.

KURDISH rebels kidnapped two British tourists from a bus in south-east
Turkey but later abandoned them when they themselves came under fire from
government troops yesterday, Reuter reports from Ankara.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) was still holding seven other tourists -
three Swiss, one Italian, two Germans and a New Zealander - seized this
month to draw attention to their separatist campaign in Turkey's south-east.
A diplomat said the Britons, a man and woman, were seized at a rebel
roadblock near the town of Kozluk in Batman province on Sunday evening.
Their kidnappers forced them to walk into the mountains, where they were
joined by two Turkish hostages.
They spent the night in the rebels' hands but were turned loose in the
morning when security forces fired on the area, making their way to the town
of Batman.
Security forces killed eight guerrillas in clashes with the kidnappers, the
emergency rule governor's office said.
The PKK has abducted a total of 27 foreign tourists since 1991 but has
released all unharmed, except the seven.
On August 10 the rebels freed four Frenchmen, a Briton and an Australian
taken in two separate kidnappings in July.

FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the activity in Vodafone, the second best performer in the FT-SE 100
Index over the past fortnight, came from two exceptionally large trades
carried out in mid-afternoon. The first a block of 6.3m shares dealt at 553
1/2 p, and the second a block of 3m at the same price. Yesterday the stock
lost 9 to 553p.
Vodafone shares have risen by more than 14 per cent in the two weeks, as
cellular stocks benefited from a rerating after the AT&amp;T bid for McCaw, the
US cellular group. The big US institutions were seen as keen buyers of
Vodafone, while some of the UK market's leading analysts have been busy
promoting the shares in the past few sessions. Activity in Vodafone
yesterday was believed to be US-sourced.
MB-Caradon was steady at 314p amid talk that the company will soon announce
a one-for-four rights issue at 280p a share, to fund its acquistion of RTZ's
Pillar division. RTZ firmed 2 to 698p.
Among transport stocks, the departure of the chairman of Union Railways, the
British Rail subsidiary responsible for the Channel tunnel rail link, hit
Eurotunnel shares, sending them down 17 to 444p.
A decline on the Hong Kong market and renewed worries about the recent poor
results from the Hang Seng Bank subsidiary saw HSBC dip 18 more to 707p on
good turnover of 4.5m. The concern about profitability in the Far East also
took its toll of Standard Chartered shares, which dropped 18 to 943p.
Lloyds Bank, affected last week by switching operations, staged a minor
rally to close 5 up at 533p. National Westminster rose a similar amount to
486p. Royal Bank of Scotland eased a penny to 289p after Scottish Equitable
confirmed it was the big seller of the shares last Friday.
National Express was in demand ahead of next month's interim figures,
appreciating 4 to 261p.
The oil sector was boosted by another session of above-average turnover in
stocks such as Lasmo and Calor. The latter was up 7 at 256p, after 258p,
following a buy recommendation issued by Hoare Govett, whose oil team
described the shares as a 'cheap income play with improving fundamentals'.
Lasmo continued to attract strong speculative support as last week's
takeover stories and talk of a general restructuring in the UK exploration
and production sub-sector continued to circulate in the marketplace. The
stock settled 2 1/2 higher at 139p on turnover of 4.6m, well above usual
levels of activity. Volume last Friday reached a very substantial 14m, after
a week of unusually high activity, leading many oil sector specialists to
the view that something may be up in the sector.
Enterprise Oil, in spite of a push from one of the market's leading broking
firms yesterday morning, suffered later in the day, eventually settling a
net 3 off at 428p.
News from Aran Energy's drilling operations in the Celtic Sea came as a
disappointment to the market, the shares sliding 4 1/2 to 31 1/2 p.
Shares in French theme park Euro Disney came under pressure, losing 3 per
cent of their value after the chairman warned of high levels of debt and
current difficult trading. The stock ended 20 down at 620p. Mr Nigel Reed at
Paribas Capital Markets believes the company will 'need an injection of
finance to keep it going'.
Talk that the chairman of Ladbroke may be thinking of retiring, following
weekend press reports that were denied by the company, along with the
appointment of a chief executive for Ladbroke's Texas Homecare subsidiary,
put the shares under pressure. They fell 9 to 209p in active trading of 6m.
Market watchers pointed out that the appointment of a new CEO at Texas, who
is to be on Ladbroke's main board, suggested that the company planned to
continue its involvement in the Do-It-Yourself market, which is currently
suffering difficult market conditions.
Continued fears that Rank Organisation's holiday business will lose out to
increasingly cheaper overseas holidays once again dogged the shares, leaving
them 12 cheaper at 770p. On the other hand, the current price war in
overseas holidays for next year is expected to boost earnings at Airtours,
which put on 5 at 379p.
Confirmation that the Hoar family had sold a 22.57 per cent stake in
USM-quoted Hoskins, the Leicester-based brewing, public houses and hotels
group, boosted trading in the stock, sending the shares ahead.
A majority of the holding was bought by a team led by entrepreneur Mr Howard
Hodgson, and the rest placed with institutions. The shares jumped 20 to 76p.
Radio shares continued to benefit from a Smith New Court review on the
sector. Capital Radio added 10 at 225p, while Chiltern Radio advanced 8 to
78p and USM-quoted Metro firmed 5 to 190p.
Nervous trading in Weir Group, ahead of Thursday's interim figures, left the
shares 14 off at 351p.
Continued worries about the future of its proposed Pounds 250m regional jets
joint venture with Taiwan continued to overhang British Aerospace, weakening
the shares by 21p at one stage. They subsequently picked up to finish 14
down on the day at 435p on talk of 'some progress' being made in talks in
Taiwan. BAe shares were hit last week by reports of outstanding differences
between the two sides in the financing of the project.
Profit-taking in Smiths Industries left the stock 10 lighter at 375p.

In a market that lacked strong features, the spotlight fell on Northern
Foods, which turned out to be the best performer in the FT-SE 100 in
percentage terms, following a broker's recommendation.
Agency broker Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken visited the company last Friday and
issued a strong buy recommendation, predicting 10 per cent earnings and
dividend growth in each of the next two years.
Investors sent the shares climbing 5 to 277p, an improvement of around 1.7
per cent on the day. Volume was, however, no more than average at 1.9m by
the close.

FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE building area of the market was again rife with speculation that a heavy
cash call is in the offing from Tarmac, still regarded as one of the UK's
biggest housebuilders.
Talk of a Pounds 200m rights issue from Tarmac has been in the market for
some time, but building sector specialists are now looking for the group to
call on its shareholders to boost its balance sheet and take advantage of
the expected recovery in the UK housing market.
Tarmac shares have performed well in recent sessions, in spite of the
persistent talk of a big cash call. Last week saw the shares feature
prominently in the list of the most heavily traded stocks. Yesterday the
shares were the London market's most active with more than 16m changing
hands after a weekend during which the Sunday press highlighted the
probability of a large fund-raising operation.
Yesterday's turnover was the highest in a single session since December 1992
and included a single trade of 6m shares dealt at 145 1/2 p.
The share price rose to 150p yesterday, fractionally below the year's peak,
before slipping back and closing a net 1 1/2 up at 148 1/2 p. Tarmac shares
have staged a strong recovery over the past year, picking up from an
all-time low of 53p, reached in September 1992.
Tarmac's interim results are scheduled for September 28. Building
specialists said, however, that those figures could well be brought forward
to accommodate a sizeable rights issue call. One leading analyst said a
Pounds 200m issue 'would come as no great surprise', adding that Tarmac is
seen as one of the sector's bellwethers, with substantial exposure at both
the light and heavy end of the market. 'The market has been well and truly
softened up for a cash call,' he added.

FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volumes were much reduced in the London derivatives markets
yesterday as the underlying equity market moved into what was clearly a
consolidation phase. A further cut in Bank of France interest rates failed
to ignite the UK market.
The futures market tried to move higher at first, encouraged by wider
reporting in London of remarks on interest rates on Friday by the
vice-president of the Bundesbank. But with European markets easier, it was
soon clear that there was limited basis for interest rate optimism in
London.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 drifted down for the rest of the
session, closing at 3,056 for a premium against cash of 11 points, compared
with estimated fair value at 6. Dealers commented that, while this premium
was quite satisfactory at this stage in the life of the contract, it
reflected no great enthusiasm. Volume of 6,709 lots was unexciting.
Very poor business was reported in traded options. Total turnover dropped
from Friday's 29,111 lots to 15,983 yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 option
seeing only 4,449 dealt, against 6,475 previously. The actives list was
headed by the Euro FT-SE option (2,482), while Lasmo (1,567) again attracted
speculative attention as investors pondered the implications of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report for British Gas. Also busy was BAe
at 686 contracts.

FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dealers undismayed by profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in London remained unconvinced of the prospects for cuts in UK
interest rates in the near term, and the UK stock market followed the
downward trend set yesterday in the other leading European bourses. London
investors took a cautious view of the latest cut in rates in France. Some
stock was sold but traders showed no dismay in the 15.6 fall to 3,042 on the
FT-SE 100 Index. Profit-taking was not unexpected in view of the market's
strong upswing and comfort was drawn from a steadier performance in UK
government bonds.
There was some playing between the September future contract on the Footsie
and the index stocks themselves, but activity in the futures sector was
never large enough to play a significant role in equities. Sterling remained
steady and it was an early fall of 16 Dow points on Wall Street that took
the heart out of London in the closing minutes of the session. Also
unsettling were suggestions that a large rights issue is in the offing,
perhaps from MB-Caradon or in the building and construction sector.
The general air of malaise also hung over the second line stocks, which have
fared so well in the market advance. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost 15 points
to 3,467.4, while trading in these smaller capitalised stocks made up around
64 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 546.8m shares. On Friday, 633.4m
shares traded through Seaq reflected retail, or customer, business of Pounds
1.58bn.
Customer business, having traded since last September at the Pounds 1bn-plus
levels regarded as profitable for the London-based securities trading
industry, has risen sharply over the past month as share prices have soared
to new territory above the Footsie 3,000 mark.
With the influence of transatlantic markets now challenged by last week's
poor trade figures from the US, international blue chips lost some of their
recently revived confidence. Pharmaceuticals, in particular, shaded lower
again, casting doubt over the rally in share prices in the sector, which
provided a significant boost to the UK market last week. Glaxo, Wellcome and
most other drug leaders lacked support yesterday.
Nor was the picture much brighter on the domestic scene. Retail issues tried
to edge forward at first as London took a fresh look at comments on German
interest rate policies made in the US on Friday by the Bundesbank's
vice-president, but support soon dwindled and the sector closed lower.
The banking segment, also closely linked to interest rate prospects since
lower rates would ease some of the sector's burden of non-performing debts,
again took its cue from a poor performance from HSBC, which was still
depressed by last week's gloomy half-time statement from Hang Seng Bank, its
Hong Kong subsidiary.
However, the stock market rallied from the day's low point on the Footsie
index of 3,035.6 and equity strategists professed to be willing to see the
index down to the 3,020 area before the present phase of profit-taking would
cause any reconsideration of medium-term views on UK equities.
The satisfactory level of retail trading volume indicated that the big
institutions were trading stock, rather than merely selling. 'Consolidation
is the name of the game,' was the comment from several leading trading
houses.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking sends Dow into
retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER four consecutive days of record-breaking gains, US stock markets ran
into profit-taking yesterday, leaving share prices marginally lower, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.50 at 3,605.98. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.93 to 455.23, while the
Nasdaq composite was off 0.10 at 730.86. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 212.5m shares.
Dealers and analysts were not surprised by Monday's losses. Share prices had
ended in positive territory last Friday only because of a late burst of
buying tied to the unwinding of stock index options that expired at the
close. On the first Monday after options expiration, stocks usually fall in
early trading as the markets retrace the upward steps taken late on the
previous Friday.
Often in such cases early selling peters out quickly, but this was not the
case yesterday as investors decided that five days of gains, which had
pushed the markets' indices to four new all-time highs, had left equities
looking overbought.
Profit-taking was, therefore, the order of the day and analysts said the
declines were a natural correction, and did not indicate a shift in
underlying sentiment.
Among individual stocks, cyclicals were mostly lower. General Electric,
which rose sharply last Friday on news of planned lay-offs, retreated
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 97 3/4 in busy trading; Caterpillar gave up Dollars
 1/8 at Dollars 80 5/8 ; International Paper slipped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars
66 3/4 ; and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
107.
Consumer shares, which fared well last week, succumbed to profit-taking.
Philip Morris receded Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 , Procter &amp; Gamble
Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/8 and RJR Nabisco Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 5 1/4 .
Drug and healthcare stocks, another sector that did well last week, also
suffered a reaction. United Healthcare dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 57
1/2 , Pfizer fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 62 7/8 , Merck eased Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 32 1/2 , Johnson &amp; Johnson shed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 40 1/8 and
Bristol-Myers Squibb gave up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 55 1/2 .
Morgan Stanley firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 78 7/8 , a 52-week high, after
the securities house announced record second-quarter earnings of Dollars
225m.
Car issues, which remain in favour with investors following strong quarterly
earnings from the big three car manufacturers and buoyant car and truck
sales, bucked the trend. Chrysler climbed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 ,
Ford added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 1/8 and General Motors was Dollars
5/8 higher at Dollars 45 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, casino stocks were in trouble, with Casino Magic
losing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 14 5/8 and Grand Casinos weakening Dollars 1
to Dollars 21 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a modest gain after relatively light trading. The TSE 300
index ended 14.6 up at 4,091.8, although rises led declines by just 356 to
351. Volume came to 38m shares valued at CDollars 413m.
Nine of the 14 sub-group indices ended higher, with golds, consumer products
and industrial products showing solid gains.
Shell Canada, which forged ahead CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 39, said it is
reviewing its operations in an attempt to cut costs and to improve its
pre-tax cash income by CDollars 250m by 1995.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris pre-empts Buba as
bourses consolidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE consolidation which began towards the end of the week extended, and in
some cases deepened yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS paid little heed to the decision by the Bank of France to suspend its
24 hour lending facility, having earlier in the day cut the interest rate by
another 50 basis points to 7.75 per cent. However, the more important
intervention rate remained unchanged at 6.75 per cent and dealers said that
the market would probably see cautious trading ahead of Thursday's
Bundesbank council meeting. They said that hopes are for Germany to cut
rates by up to 0.5 percentage points, enabling the French to cut rates by
some 25 basis points.
The CAC-40 index lost 16.83 to 2,111.37 in turnover of some FFr2.4bn.
Euro Disney was off 4 per cent shortly after the opening following negative
weekend media comment and confirmation by the group that summer bookings had
been weak. Analysts reiterated sell recommendations on the stock and
commented that the future of the company was dependent on the refinancing
package currently being negotiated. The shares finally closed off 80
centimes at Fl 56.00, having seen a day's low of FFr54.50.
Alcatel Alsthom saw further profit-taking after last Friday's announcement
that it had won a South Korean contract, easing FFr10 to FFr722. Lafarge
Coppee lost FFr16.50 to FFr423.50 on a report that the European Commission
might be about to impose fines on some European cement companies.
FRANKFURT fell faster with the DAX index 34.41, or 1.8 per cent lower at
1,888.27 after dropping 16.30 on Friday from a three year high of 1,938.98.
Turnover was DM5.7bn.
Some observers thought that the consolidation could go a lot further; 1,800
was mentioned. But Mr Patrick Bettscheider, head of equity sales at Bank
Julius Bar in Frankfurt, and jointly in charge of the trading desk, said
that he saw a further 20-point drop as the worst-case scenario.
Mr Bettscheider thought that yesterday's drop was exaggerated by an overhang
from the triple options expiry on the Deutsche Terminborse last Friday.
Before the consolidation the bank had seen 'quite encouraging' buying from a
number of big institutions, he said; he believes that global investors are
still underweight in Germany, and that the DAX will break through its April
1990 all time high of 1,976.43 in the near future.
DB Research, too, said that the consolidation was healthy. Its chief
equities analyst, Mr Thomas Neisse, saw the DAX reaching 2,000 this year and
predicted a rise to 2,200 in the first or second quarter of 1994.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower in the absence of major corporate news, the CBS
Tendency index losing 0.8 to 121.1. Nedlloyd and Wolters Kluwer, which
reports half year results today, both went against the trend, with
respective rises of Fl 1.10 and 80 cents to Fl 43.10 and Fl 98.30.
Polygram eased Fl 1.40 to Fl 63.00. The stock has attracted positive
brokers' comments following its good results recently. Kleinwort Benson's
Dutch team have restated their buy recommendation, citing its long-term
earnings growth of 20 per cent plus per annum.
MILAN retreated a little from earlier highs further but most brokers said
that sentiment remained firm. The Comit index closed 3.00 higher at 618.68.
Italcable featured a 4.3 per cent rise to L10,240 as the issue began to
catch up with gains in the telecommunications sector last week. Elsewhere in
the sector Sip added L42 to L3,660 and Stet L47 to L4,597.
ZURICH's SMI index eased 6.7 to 2,467.3 in calm dealings. Brown Boveri
continued to face selling pressure after last week's satisfactory first-half
results, falling SFr22 to SFr896.
STOCKHOLM remained weak with profit-taking being noted in the banking
sector, down 3.7 per cent on the day. The Affarsvarlden general index lost
17.9 to 1,291.6 as turnover remained strong at SKr1.5bn.
Handelsbanken A shares shed SKr2 to SKr146 ahead of today's half year
results.
OSLO extended last week's falls, the All-share index losing 11.03 or 1.9 per
cent to 562.11 in turnover of NKr658m. Uni Storebrand, which reported a
first half profit of NKr689m, slightly below expectations, lost NKr0.20 to
NKr19.30.
Moving east, bourses offered various reactions to the day's consolidation.
VIENNA followed Frankfurt, but at a distance with the ATX index down 13.30,
or 1.3 per cent at 1,000.66. ATHENS continued its downward plunge with a
34.63 drop to 868.53 leaving the general index down 7.9 per cent in a week;
and WARSAW ignored the trend altogether in price terms as the all-share WIG
index leapt 385.5, or 6.4 per cent to record 6,390.6.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average weakens
in lowest volume of the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volume was the lowest of the year yesterday as investors remained
absent on uncertainty regarding both the future course of the strong yen and
the government's policy in reviving the economy, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average slipped 193.12 to 20,414.14, its fifth consecutive
decline, having opened at the day's high of 20,595.26 before easing steadily
during the session to hit the day's low of 20,384.44 just before the close.
Volume was 139.3m shares, below the previous year's low of 140.7m shares
registered on July 5. Declines led advances by 742 to 217, with 194 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 15.01 to
1,644.18 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index softened 1.52 to 1,254.44.
Foreign investors were small-lot buyers, but some banks were seen taking
profits on their long-term portfolios ahead of the September mid-term book
closing. Dealers were also seen selling as this is the final week for August
delivery.
Investors, hoping that the first policy speech in the afternoon by Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, would present measures to boost the
economy, were disappointed. Mr Hosokawa expressed concern but failed to map
out specific measures.
Meanwhile, the yen once again strengthened on buying by exporters in spite
of active intervention by the Bank of Japan. The dollar yesterday closed
Y1.10 down at Y103.35.
Fading prospects of a cut in the official discount rate hurt financial
issues. Bank of Yokohama, the day's most active issue, lost Y10 to Y1,110,
Bank of Tokyo fell Y70 to Y1,640 and Fuji Bank shed Y60 to Y2,370.
Telecommunication shares were lower: Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone dropped
Y7,000 to Y936,000 on reports that it might delay the commercialisation of
its next-generation communications network. KDD, the international telecom
company, fell Y500 to Y11,800 on plans for a rate cut in international calls
this October.
Ricoh, which was supported last week on its technology for turning copied
paper into blank pages, receded Y7 to Y808 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 157.29 to 22,377.34 in volume of 35.8m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, went against the trend, rising Y310
to Y9,710 on reports that it is developing a new generation of video game
hardware.
Roundup
THE WEEK began with a mixture of profit-taking and record highs in New
Zealand and Manila. Bombay was closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG shed 2 per cent as the banking sector continued to fall back
following last week's disappointing results from Hang Seng Bank, down
HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 55.50. HSBC Holdings, the parent group, also lost
HKDollars 2, to HKDollars 81.50.
The Hang Seng index slipped 156.94 to 7,388.4, just above the day's low.
Swire Pacific, which reports this week, declined HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars
39 on forecasts of poor results.
SINGAPORE retreated from all-time highs at the close as investors took
profits. The Straits Times Industrial index gave up a net 7.78 at 1,964.49,
having seen an intra-day record high of 1,982.39.
Brokers pointed out that Malaysian shares traded over the counter were sold
on news that the country's finance minister would make a challenge for the
deputy president's post in November.
In KUALA LUMPUR the reports of the challenge also gave investors an
incentive to take profits and the composite index eased 0.25 to 805.26 in
volume of 365.4m shares.
NEW ZEALAND continued its rally, the NZSE-40 capital index finishing at its
highest level since January 1990. Among the actives, Carter Holt Harvey
advanced 7 cents to NZDollars 3.49 and Brierley Investments 3 cents to
NZDollars 1.18. The index gained 8.85 at 2,027.37 in turnover of NZDollars
60.1m.
Fletcher Challenge met renewed profit-taking, easing 4 cents to NZDollars
3.66, but the shares still remain 22 per cent up following the good results
last week.
AUSTRALIA was moderately firmer as many investors consolidated positions
after last week's strong gains.
The All Ordinaries index closed 5.7 higher at 1,932.8 in turnover of
ADollars 391.4m.
Strong buy orders from Hong Kong lifted BHP 14 cents to ADollars 15.50. News
Corp, which reports tomorrow, added 10 cents at ADollars 9.30.
MANILA rose to record levels again, led by Philippine Long Distance
Telephone, which climbed 25 pesos to 1,190 pesos. The composite index put on
20.29 at 1,783.30 in turnover of 429m pesos.
SEOUL was easier as profit-taking was seen among large-capitalisation
issues. The composite index finished 7.33 down at 727.06 in turnover of
Won309.9bn.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Decline in Japan slows World Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At one point last week, five Pacific Rim equity markets, three senior
bourses in Europe, Wall Street in the US and Toronto in Canada were all
hitting 1993 highs; yet the FT-Actuaries World Index ended the week with a
rise of just 0.5 per cent.
Some high-profile investment destinations, such as Germany, France, the UK
and Hong Kong, saw profit-taking last Friday; but Japan was the real drag on
the World Index with a fall of 1.4 per cent in local currency terms.
Nomura's global strategy team in London, headed by Mr Nicholas Knight, put
out a sell recommendation on Japanese equities last week, noting that the
market at that point was still 46 per cent higher than it was a year
earlier.
Given that, say the team, the key priority now may be the wish to avoid a
repetition of the 'bubble' economy of the mid to late 1980s; the authorities
may seek to reflect the economy to the exclusion of the stock market, and a
'wall of money' might come out of Japan to cap the rising yen.
Opinions are divided on whether Japanese money has been feeding gains
elsewhere on the Pacific Rim. Mr David Bates at Asia Equity says his clients
have been thinking positively after a bullish National Day in Singapore,
Malaysia expected to produce a repeat performance at the end of this month,
and Hong Kong moving from exuberance to caution - the latter over China
worries and the Hang Seng Bank results - at the end of last week.
However, Ms Pauline McAtamney at Ord Minett thinks that New Zealand,
certainly, must have seen some new source of funds as turnover boomed last
week, and its World Index constituent index climbed by a heady 9.7 per cent.
Fletcher Challenge lit the touch paper with results better than market
expectations, indicating that forestry returns had touched bottom, and with
its plans for a separate vehicle for its forestry assets.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French and Danes cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH France and Denmark cut their short-term interest rates yesterday,
giving a small lift to European markets ahead of this week's Bundesbank
council meeting, writes James Blitz.
The Bank of France's 50 basis-point cut in its overnight rate of lending was
the fifth successive easing since the August crisis in the exchange rate
mechanism, and took the rate to 7.75 per cent.
Denmark reduced its 14-day CD rate from 11 per cent to 10.5 per cent, its
first easing of policy since the widening of currency bands.
France's move was followed yesterday afternoon by a suspension of lending
through the overnight rate window for the remainder of the day.
The market viewed this as a technical move rather than a signal on policy,
with one dealer suggesting that the French money market had been amply
supplied with funds.
However, another dealer wondered whether this might be a precursor to a
reintro-duction of the five to 10-day lending window, which had been at 7.75
per cent before being increased to 10 per cent in the run-up to the ERM
crisis.
In any event, the cut in the overnight rate was well priced in by the
futures market, and the September Pibor contract dropped 9 basis points to
close at 93.19. The December contract declined 6 basis points to finish at
94.27.
In Germany, Euromark contracts were a little more buoyant in the run-up to
this week's Bundesbank council meeting. The September contract gained 3
basis points to end at 93.55 and the December contract was up 3 basis points
at a closing 94.02.
The rise in these contracts was partly due to speculation that the
Bundesbank would lower the discount rate on Thursday. However, few dealers
believe an easing in the repo rate is likely in its wake. Call money
remained at 6.90 per cent yesterday, modestly above the repo rate level.
Short-term interest rates in the sterling cash market were fractionally
softer, helped by the firm despatch of a large Pounds 1.85bn daily shortage
and anticipation of policy easing in Germany.
Three-month money closed at 5 27/32 per cent yesterday, a fraction below the
5 7/8 per cent at which it had stood unmoved last week. The December short
sterling contract was up 2 basis points at 94.59.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen gains further ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN continued to gain ground against the dollar in Monday's Asian and
European trading, in spite of the US Federal Reserve's intervention in
support of its currency last week, writes James Blitz.
Last Friday, the yen was already clawing back some of the lost ground
against the dollar, closing in London at Y104.85. When Tokyo opened on
Monday, the Japanese currency moved even higher, in spite of comments from
officials that an economic expansion plan would be launched in September and
that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, would visit the US in late
September.
Dealers said the upward pressure on the yen continued to come from
exporters, who sold dollars at comparatively high levels in the belief that
they might get less yen for them if they waited.
However, once the dollar reached the Y103.30 level, the Bank of Japan
intervened to support the currency, and fears that the US would echo the
move stopped the weakening in the dollar/yen rate. There was no intervention
when US markets opened, and the rate closed at Y103.25. It is still
uncertain whether the dollar will breach the Y100 level, as so many dealers
anticipated at the start of last week. In New York it finished at Y103.10.
In Europe, the main focus was on cuts in French and Danish interest rates,
in the latter case the first since the exchange rate mechanism's bands were
widened.
The 50 basis-point cut in the French overnight rate, to 7.75 per cent, did
not lead to a heavy depreciation of the franc, which ended at FFr3.485 per
D-Mark from FFr3.478. The Danish cut had little effect on the krone, which
closed at DKr4.1043 to the D-Mark.
In both cases, the currencies held steady because of a strong belief in the
market that the Bundesbank will lower its discount rate at its first meeting
after the summer recess on Thursday. The market is far less certain that
there will be a cut in the German central bank's repo rate, however. Today's
inflation figure for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg will be an early
indication of how much room for manoeuvre the central bank has.
Miss Wendy Niffikeer, international economist at IBJ International, believes
a discount rate cut has been well priced in by the market. If the Bundesbank
eases its rate floor by  1/2 percentage point on Thursday, it is unlikely to
lead to a fall in the D-Mark's value.
The weaker currencies in Europe were less well underpinned yesterday because
of speculation that their countries might try to reduce interest rates in
advance of the Bundesbank meeting.
The peseta declined yesterday morning, bottoming out at Pta81.05 to the
D-Mark from a previous Pta80.97, but it closed at Pta80.92. The Portuguese
escudo receded yesterday to Es101.95 to the D-Mark from a previous Es101.40.
Sterling was largely unaffected, finishing unchanged at DM2.5375.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Board said yesterday that returns for Australian
Standard White wheat of 10 per cent protein were expected to stay firm at
Australian Dollars 155 (USDollars 105) a tonne for the year ending September
30, 1994, reports Reuter from Sydney.
Mr John Lawrenson, the board's managing director, said that the estimated
return was at the top end of the range of forecasts made over the past few
months, although it was well down from returns of ADollars 188 a tonne
forecast for 1992-93.
The 1993-94 estimate was based on an Australian crop of about 15m tonnes and
a continuing build-up of wheat stocks around the world.
The wheat board was more optimistic about returns for high protein, premium
grade wheats, Mr Lawrenson said.
'We're estimating a return of ADollars 168 a tonne for Australian hard wheat
at 12 per cent protein and ADollars 200 a tonne for prime hard wheat at 13
per cent protein. That's a rise of ADollars 3 and ADollars 10 a tonne
respectively above our previous estimates.'
However, he said the market for protein premiums this season remained
volatile. 'They have risen and fallen by as much as ADollars 5 a tonne in
the week in recent times and future protein premiums will depend on the
quality of the US and Canadian spring wheat crops now being harvested.'
Mr Lawrenson estimated that Australia would carry more than 1m tonnes of
last season's downgraded wheat into the new selling year, depressing returns
for any off-grade wheat produced in the 1993-94 season.
'It's unusual to forecast returns for off-grade wheat so early in the season
but growers should be under no illusion as to the difficulty of marketing
another large quantity of poorer quality wheat in a world market already
over-supplied from last year's damaged crop,' he said.
The AWB forecast returns of ADollars 145 a tonne for Grade Pool 1 wheat and
ADollars 130 a tonne for Grade Pool 2 wheat for 1993-94.

SUGAR GROWERS in Natal are struggling to save what they can of the
drought-stricken 1993-1994 crop, which is expected to yield only 1.2m
tonnes, down 300,000 tonnes from last year and 900,000 tonnes below the
normal level, according to industry officials, reports Reuter from Durban.
'There was some rain in parts of Zululand but it is not going to do anything
to this crop. It might save the cane roots from dying,' South African Sugar
Cane Growers' Association executive director Mr Rex Hudson said.
He added that the Natal south coast and midlands were the worst affected
production areas. Extensive replanting would have to be done as a result of
the drought, he said.

<TEXT>
STATE-OWNED Minero Peru has fixed the base price for its Cerro Verde copper
mine to be sold off on October 13 at Dollars 30m, with a minimum investment
requirement of Dollars 60m, the company's president, Mr Raul Otero, said
yesterday, reports Reuter from Lima. The Dollars 30m is to be in cash and
the investment is to be over five years.
Mr Otero said the investment pledged by 19 of the potential bidders who
qualified would be a key factor as Minero was unable to develop the second
stage of the mine for lack of financing and it would signal the bidders'
long-term plans.
The figures would be kept low to allow each of the 19 qualifiers to assess
the mine's worth. They are at present making analyses of the mine to verify
its reserves.
Latest studies show that Cerro Verde, located in the southern region of
Arequipa, has a potential output of 100,000 tonnes of copper a year.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise further on
Nigerian unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA Brent crude prices edged up 11 cents in light trading yesterday
with oil for October delivery reaching Dollars 17.09 1/2 a barrel as the
market searched for direction amid conflicting signals.
Prices were pushed upwards yesterday by market fears over the civil unrest
in Nigeria and the possibility that a general strike called for Wednesday
could affect oil loadings.
The threat of an Iraqi return to the market, which caused so much price
volatility last month, has abated for now. The Iraqis are pushing the United
Nations for a complete lifting of sanctions rather than the one-off oil sale
that was previously under negotiation.
But the oil price is unlikely to show much of a rise beyond Dollars 17 a
barrel before the next meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries on September 25 since countries are continuing to over-produce.
Opec output is estimated at 24.6m barrels a day - 1m b/d higher than the
ceiling.
'The market is trying to grapple with a number of crucial issues, but at
least mentally, it's still on holiday,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith
Barney's energy desk in London.
Opec officials have estimated that the call on Opec oil from production and
stocks will run to 26.02m b/d for the final quarter of the year. Since stock
levels are fairly high that does not leave much room for a production
increase.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium institute projects no
permanent cuts in capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NO PERMANENT cuts in primary aluminium production capacity are planned by
producers despite present low prices and market turmoil caused by imports
from the Commonwealth of Independent States, according to the latest
projections by members of the International Primary Aluminium Institute.
These show forecast capacity in 1996 virtually unchanged from today's in
every region except Africa. There Alusaf in South Africa plans a Pounds 940m
smelter expansion, adding 460,000 tonnes to its present 170,000 tonnes of
annual capacity.
The Alusaf project will help African capacity almost double from 657,000
tonnes to 1.2m tonnes by 1996. According to the IPAI, total western world
capacity will rise by 4 per cent to 16.7m tonnes Projected mid-1996 capacity
in other regions is: North America 6.425m tonnes (6.424m tonnes in 1993);
Latin America 2.07m tonnes (2.023m) East and South Asia 1.766m tonnes
(1.736m); Europe 3.553m tonnes (3.506m) and Oceania 1.664m tonnes (same).
Russian output of primary aluminium was 98 per cent of last year's levels in
the first seven months of 1993, but nickel production fell to 80 per cent of
year-ago levels, according to new government data, reports Reuter from
Moscow.
Statistics released by the government press service showed that July primary
aluminium production was 100.3 per cent of levels in July 1992.
July nickel production was 71.4 per cent of year-ago levels.
Data on tonnages was not given.

London's robusta COFFEE futures climbed to the highest levels since the
London Commodity Exchange's dollar contract was introduced in March 1991 as
the market continued to be aided by concern about nearby supply tightness.
The prompt September position touched Dollars 1,253 a tonne and the November
quotation Dollars 1,222 a tonne. The latter closed at Dollars 1,220 a tonne,
up Dollars 18. But dealers said the turnover was fairly light at just 2,825
lots (5 tonnes each) despite signs of continued roaster buying in the
physical market, particularly of lower grade beans. COCOA also continued on
its recent uptrend, closing with gains of up to Pounds 18 a tonne. Dealers
said both charts and the market's fundamentals appeared to be pointing
towards higher levels. The first objective was to overcome the
psychologically barrier at Pounds 800 a tonne for the December position,
which closed Pounds 15 up at Pounds 794 a tonne. At the London Metal
Exchange three months COPPER surged in the afternoon to end at Dollars
1,923.50 a tonne, a gain of Dollars 16.50 a tonne from Friday. Traders
attributed the rise to commission house buying, possibly including orders on
Chinese account.

THE RUSSIAN government and the local authorities in Irkutsk, the region that
is home to the disputed Sukhoi Log gold deposit, have set up a conciliatory
commission to work out differences over a deal giving a small Australian
company a stake in the local gold producer.
Mr Vladimir Dvornichenko, acting head of the regional administration, which
initially supported a deal between Lenzoloto and Star Technology Systems,
said on Friday that the administration had turned against the deal because
the final terms were agreed without its final support.
The commission was created on Monday last week after the Irkutsk authorities
took the State Property Committee in Moscow to court in protest against the
terms of the deal.
The State Property Committee, which is responsible for managing state
property and privatisation, endorsed the creation of a joint stock company
in which Star would hold 31 per cent and which would include Sukhoi Log,
Russia's largest hard rock deposit, among the company's assets.
The conciliatory commission includes representatives of all parties
concerned except for Star. 'At this stage Star is not needed. Star is a
victim of, not a party to this conflict,' claimed Mr Dvornichenko.
He said that he believed the commission should reconsider the inclusion of
Sukhoi Log among the new company's assets, and also remove some other assets
from its balance sheet. He said the commission should also seek full and
clear information as how the Russian and Australian partners in the deal
intended to proceed.
Mr Ivan Zelent, first deputy chairman of the regional parliament, said the
local authorities were divided over the issue, and that he believed a final
decision should be taken by the court. 'We need to start developing the
deposit as fast as possible. That will help us increase our local budget
revenues.'
Separately, the new company also needs to get a licence from the State
Geology Committee in Moscow confirming the rights held by its Russian
founder to mine Sukhoi Log, which Star previously claimed was unnecessary.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fungus spoils appetite for US
wheat - A disease that is adding to exporters' problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCOVERY OF a poisonous fungus in the US spring wheat crop prompted a jump
in US wheat prices last week and threw wheat buying agencies in Japan into
nervous consternation. Japan is one of the biggest consumers for
high-protein US wheat, and one of the few that pays in cash.
The crop quality concerns have since abated, but are still sufficiently
significant, analysts say, to sustain firm prices for high quaility wheat
worldwide.
The fungus outbreak could not have come at a worse time for US wheat
exporters. Winter wheat growers have just completed a healthy harvest and
are beginning to realise that their biggest buyers - Russia and China - are
drastically trimming their grain import intentions. With production growing
and the international wheat trade slowing, the US Department of Agriculture
projects world wheat stocks will rise by 2.6m tonnes this year, to 135.21m
tonnes.
Good crop prospects and dull export conditions left the US wheat market on
the sidelines for most of the summer as relentless rains played havoc in the
central Midwest and maize and soyabean prices soared. Except for a small a
portion grown on the dry southern and western plains the US winter wheat
crop escaped the floods.
Until recently spring wheat crop prospects also appeared excellent. Three
weeks ago a group of agricultural specialists and journalists conducted
their annual tour of North Dakota and Minnesota spring wheat fields and
announced the crop was two to three weeks late because of cool weather, but
in superb condition.
'Then,' says Mr Jim Peterson, marketing specialist for the North Dakota
Wheat Commission, 'we got several days of really hot weather, and with so
much moisture in the ground, some of the fields were like saunas.' The cool
developmental period and late steamy conditions fostered a plant disease
known as 'scab' or 'head blight', which produces a fungus that can cause
nausea when consumed in sufficient quantities.
Hard red spring wheat is prized for its high protein levels, and is often
blended with lower protein winter wheats for bread making.
News of toxins in the first bushels of the North Dakota wheat harvest threw
spring wheat futures prices at the Minneapolis grain exchange into a tumult.
The September contract rallied 23 cents, to Dollars 3.42 a bushel (60lb) in
two days, and cash prices soared above Dollars 5.50 a bushel as millers bid
up the premiums they pay for high protein wheat.
The scurry for protein, traders say, was encouraged by reports that Canada's
spring wheat crop was more than three weeks behind normal development and in
danger of an early frost. France, the world's biggest high-protein wheat
producer, is also experiencing quality reductions because of heavy harvest
rains.
Some analysts estimated initially that as much as 20 per cent of the
projected 640m bushel US spring wheat crop was affected by the fungus. But
crop specialists are now calling the disease problem 'localised' and are
waiting for more of the crop to be cut. The US Department of Agriculture
said last week that as of August 15, only 7 per cent of spring wheat fields
had been harvested.
By the end of the week the September spring wheat price had moved back by 20
cents. The earlier rise 'was too strong a reaction,' says Mr Warren King,
market specialist for Cargill Investors Services in Chicago. 'Wheat prices
are 60 to 70 cents per bushel higher today than they were when the 1988
drought cut the spring wheat crop nearly in half. That doesn't make a lot of
sense.'
In the meantime, US wheat exporters are trying to calm their best customers.
Japan dithered over its regular weekly offers last week, but its buyers are
expected to be back in the US wheat market again today. 'They are being
cautious,' says Mr Greg Dowd, crop specialist with the export marketing
group US Wheat Associates.
He thinks that China will buy only about 2.5m tonnes of US wheat this year,
less than half of its purchases three years ago. Russia, with a good crop of
its own and lingering credit problems at the USDA, may take only donated US
wheat this year. The former Soviet Union bought 6m tonnes of US wheat last
year. 'We'll have to scramble pretty hard to make up for loss of business
that size,' Mr Dowd says.
In its August 11 crop report the USDA estimated that US wheat stocks would
climb to 741m bushels this year, from 529m last year, mostly because of
fading export prospects.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper traders expect Japanese
output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE COPPER smelters are likely to cut output soon, removing up to
200,000 tonnes of annual supply from the market, according to traders and
analysts.
The cuts are expected because of weak demand in Japan itself and because the
charges smelters make for treating copper concentrates, an intermediate
material, are falling.
The Highland Valley mining company is reported to have completed a deal
recently with Mitsubishi, Dowa and Sumitomo of Japan for between 65,000 and
75,000 tonnes at treatment charges of USDollars 102 a tonne, substantially
below the Dollars 115 to Dollars 120 a tonne levels negotiated earlier this
year between miners and custom smelters.
'If, as we expect, the concentrates market continues to tighten, treatment
charges will move increasingly in favour of the mines,' says Mr Angus
MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the
Royal/Dutch Shell group.
'Some observers believe that the Japanese smelter pool, which is exporting
copper for less than it would get in its protected domestic market, will cut
output and reduce its demand for concentrates.'
Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services
group, suggests that in the short term there is 'a very good floor' under
the three-month London Metal Exchange copper price at 80 to 83 cents a lb.
However, 'if the Japanese smelters start to cut back production in coming
weeks, as we and many other observers expect, then copper prices will
stabilise at a higher level'.
One complicating factor is a deal being put together by a big trading house
for some consumers to give them guaranteed long-term copper prices. This may
be completed by the end of August. 'When the deal is concluded there may be
a temporary price setback,' says Mr Arnold. But, 'if the pricing deal
results, as more and more observers think it will, in the withdrawal of
100,000 tonnes of copper from LME warehouse stocks, then copper prices are
unlikely to fall far for very long'.
In Merrill's latest Weekly Futures Report he says that, although copper
stocks are high, 'they can hardly be described as crushing at around eight
weeks of consumption'.
Mr Arnold says Merrill is not expecting 'runaway copper prices. But price
surges up to the 90 to 95 cents a lb area in coming months would not
surprise us'.
In Billiton's latest Metals Report, Mr MacMillan argues that fears about a
lack of world copper smelting capacity are unfounded. A tightness in
capacity last year was eased by merchants shipping concentrates to remote
locations such as the Commonwealth of Independent States and Zambia for
treatment, he points out.
While some greenfield smelter projects have been cancelled, additions to
existing smelters will add more than 700,000 tonnes of annual capacity
between 1992 and the end of 1994. Also, nearly half the 972,000 tonnes of
new annual copper mining capacity by the end of 1995 would use the SX-EW
(solvent extraction-electro winning) technology which dispenses with the
need for conventional smelting plants.
Estimates vary, but there is a broad consensus that SX-EW now accounts for
more than 10 per cent of total western world refined copper output compared
with 7 per cent in the mid-1980s, Mr MacMillan points out. 'This proportion
is likely to rise to about 15-16 per cent during the second half of this
decade and could be as high as 18 per cent by the year 2000. By 1994 the
production of copper by the SX-EW route will almost certain exceed 1m
tonnes.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Europe stands back ahead of German rate
decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, PATRICK HARVERSON and R. C. MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK, BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets were yesterday caught in the thrall of the
German rate cut debate and held fast ahead of the first signals due today.
Many economists expect a quarter-point reduction in the all-important German
discount rate to 6.25 per cent, which could allow France to lower its 6.75
per cent intervention rate. It would also give other EC members,
particularly Belgium, a chance to ease further.
However, high money supply figures last week cast a shadow over the leeway
that the members of the Bundesbank Council will have when they return from
their summer break for Thursday's meeting.
Analysts are waiting keenly to see whether Germany's repo auction on
Wednesday will be fixed at 6.8 per cent or variable. If the latter, the repo
could rise slightly, increasing the gap with the discount rate.
The first regional inflation figure is also expected today and could provide
an opportunity for easing if it points to a national figure of less than 3
per cent on a three-month annualised basis. German government bond futures
on Liffe rose 9 basis points to 97.07.
FRENCH debt prices marked time despite the suspension of the emergency
24-hour lending facility set up to counter the wave of franc selling that
led to the broadening of the ERM bands at the beginning of the month.
The standard five-day to 10-day lending rate remained at a punishingly high
10 per cent but is expected to fall to the final 24-hour level of 7.75 per
cent shortly. French 10-year futures closed two basis points firmer at
122.16. However, the balance of strength was on the shorter end of the yield
curve which is more sensitive to interest rate cuts.
IN the UK, gilts were firm at the long end, but the sustained rally of
recent weeks appeared to lose some impetus.
With no significant domestic data or political factors to concentrate on,
dealers waited to see what would happen in Germany. Long gilt futures were
up  3/32 at 112 15/16 by the close but the support was not there and
turnover was just over a paltry 14,500 contracts.
HIGH-yielding markets were enlivened by a rate cut and encouraging inflation
data. Spanish Bonos futures lifted more than half a point to 97.59 after the
central bank announced a one-point reduction in its intervention rate.
Although not significant in itself economists said the cut heralded an
easing in the repo today from its present 10.57 per cent.
In Italy, government bonds responded to the latest consumer prices data that
represented encouraging year-on-year inflation of 4.4 per cent, unchanged
from the official July figure. They also bounced from a sharp technically
inspired fall late last week. Italian bond futures on Liffe lifted half a
point to around 111.44.
Portuguese bonds, especially long maturities, closed higher on strong demand
from local investors who foresaw foreign buying later as interest rates
fall.
DANISH bonds reacted to a half-point cut in the central bank's 14-day
certificate of deposit rate to 10.5 per cent - the first since early
August's ERM changes.
Short-term bonds lifted with 9.25 per cent two-year paper rising 0.25 point
to 104.75. But the cut failed to impact on longer-term paper - the key 8 per
cent Danish state bond due 2003 closed five basis points lower at 108.87 on
profit-taking.
US TREASURY prices eased slightly yesterday in listless trading.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at
100 11/32 , yielding 6.222 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 9/16 , to yield 3.927 per cent.
Trading was extremely quiet, primarily because this is the most popular week
on Wall Street for holidays. In the absence of fresh economic news, the
market's attention was focused on upcoming supply, although there were
reports of continued buying of bonds from overseas investors before New York
opened.
On the supply front, the Treasury is due to auction Dollars 16bn of two-year
notes today, followed by Dollars 11bn of five-year notes tomorrow. Traders
said that the short-end of the market eased slightly yesterday in
anticipation of the auctions.
Lazards, Barclays and James Capel have won the mandate to lead manage a
Dollars 100m Euro convertible issue for Shipping Credit and Investment
Corporation of India, writes R. C. Murthy in Bombay.
Essar Gujarat floated a Euro convertible with put option, which attracted
investors. Shipping Credit is expected to allow a similar put option to its
Euro convertible scheduled for launch in October.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Guinness Mahon to form
specialist bond-broking unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS MAHON, the UK merchant bank owned by the Bank of Yokohama, is
setting up a capital markets operation which will specialise in broking
bonds.
'A major capability in the fixed income sector is something I have been
seeking for some time,' said Mr David Potter, chairman and chief executive
of Guinness Mahon.
Guinness Mahon Capital Markets will be headed by Mr Guy Burgun, who
previously ran Leu Securities, and will be staffed by 10 former Leu traders.
Leu Securities, part of the Bank Leu group which is majority-owned by CS
Holding, was closed down at the end of July and its activities merged with
Swiss Volksbank's London operation to form Swiss Volksbank Securities.
The move was part of a restructuring of subsidiaries of CS Holding, the
parent company of the financial group built around Credit Suisse, which
bought Swiss Volksbank for SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in an agreed takeover
in March.
Mr Potter said the development of the fixed income side of the business
would provide greater balance, as the company was currently mainly
equity-orientated through its stockbroking and corporate finance businesses.
He said: 'We will want to focus on developing our presence in the sterling
market. We have been successful as an agency broker in equities and will
look at the possibility of agency broking in gilts.'
However, the firm will not attempt to compete for Eurobond underwriting
business. 'The barriers for entry into the primary market are too high,' he
said.
The new unit, which starts trading on September 1, will concentrate on
broking less liquid Eurobonds and structuring private transactions.
Bank of Yokohama, Japan's largest regional bank, took over Guinness Mahon in
1991 after the company had suffered heavy losses on leasing, property and
commercial loans during the 1980s.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Bonds: JP Morgan pulls off first 15-year
D-Mark offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. MORGAN, the US banking group, brought off a considerable coup
yesterday when it arranged the first 15-year bond offering in the D-Mark
sector.
So far, foreign banks have had only limited success in winning mandates in
this important sector of the international bond market. For years it has
been dominated by German banks, Deutsche and Dresdner in particular.
Mr Maarten van Eden, head of J. P. Morgan's syndicate desk in London, said
that yields on 15-year Dutch and French government bonds were used as a
guide when pricing the DM1bn offering for LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance,
because a German government bond of that maturity does not exist.
The yield differentials between 10-year French, German and Dutch government
bonds were also taken into account.
The calculations resulted in a theoretical 15-year bund yield of 6.70 per
cent, in line with the yield on French government bonds and 15 basis points
above the yield on Dutch government bonds. This compares with a yield of
around 6.80 per cent on 15-year German domestic bonds.
LKB's bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 1/2 per cent, were priced to yield
6.69 per cent, or 36 basis points above the 6 1/2 per cent bund of July
2003. When they were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly.
'You can argue that this is aggressive since it prices this issue where you
would expect to see the bund,' Mr van Eden said. However, he felt that the
pricing of the bonds was justified by strong investor demand for long-dated
paper, the issuer's triple A rating and closeness to German state risk, and
the fact that there were no comparable issues outstanding.
Syndicate managers involved in the deal said that they expected further
15-year D-Mark offerings to emerge now that a precedent had been set.
They reported good demand for such offerings from pension funds and
insurance companies which have to match liabilities of a similar maturity.
They said that the most obvious borrowers at this area of the yield curve
were sovereigns, but that the lack of swap opportunities would limit their
scope.
Lehman Brothers also stole the German banks' thunder yesterday when it
arranged a 10-year bond issue for LB Schleswig-Holstein.
Demand was such that the issue was increased by DM50m to DM200m. The issuer
has an option to change the status of the bonds from senior to subordinated
debt.
Lehman Brothers was also active in the Euroyen sector, leading a Y10bn
three-year offering of floating rate notes for itself. The notes, which pay
interest of 40 basis points above three-month Libor, attracted demand from
Asia.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: F&amp;C to launch India fund for
mid-sized companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Management, one of the first fund management groups to
give investors access to the emerging markets in Latin America in the late
1980s, is about to launch an open-ended fund investing in medium-sized
Indian companies.
India is widely regarded as the emerging market of the 1990s, following the
country's introduction of free market reforms.
Some Dollars 1bn is already invested in Indian equities through existing
closed-end funds. F&amp;C hopes that its fund, Indian Investment Company Sicav,
will attract between Dollars 50m and Dollars 100m during its launch period,
which runs from September 6 to October 1.
Mr Sanjit Talukdar, Indico's fund manager, said the fund provided an
opportunity to invest in India's medium-sized companies which, he believed,
were greatly undervalued.
Trading in the shares of medium-sized companies has become much more liquid
in the past three years when turnover in the so-called 'B' shares has risen
from 15 per cent to 27 per cent of daily turnover which is now Dollars 100m.
Mr Talukdar said Indico was the first fund to be managed offshore and to
employ an adviser from the private sector. 'This gives us freedom of
activity from local advisers,' Mr Talukdar said.
Until the introduction of new legislation last September, the Indian
ministry of finance only gave approval for open-ended funds which were
administered by India's public-sector banks.

offer

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, the Atlanta-based carrier, is offering voluntary early
retirement to some of its employees, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The airline said that about 3,000 people would be eligible for the
programme, and that it would take a one-off accounting charge, of about

SHARES in Varity, the US automotive, farm and industrial equipment maker,
rose Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 37 1/8 yesterday, a 52-week high,
after the company posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
In the latest quarter, it took a one-time charge of Dollars 1.7m, or 5 cents
a share, which left net income at Dollars 14.4m, or 29 cents. In the same
period of 1992, Varity had net income of Dollars 14.1m, or 37 cents. Sales
in the three months dropped to Dollars 660.9m from Dollars 891.4m,
reflecting the disposal of several businesses.
Stripping out one-time charges, taxes and earnings of associated companies,
Varity earned Dollars 15.4m in the 1993 quarter against Dollars 17.6m a year
earlier.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive, said the company had cut its
interest expense by 73 per cent in the second quarter, reflecting the
restructuring and financing actions. The company's consolidated debt is
Dollars 1bn lower than last year.
Kelsey-Hayes, the automotive components business, had operating income of
Dollars 19m on sales of Dollars 256m in the latest quarter. On a pro forma
basis, earnings were Dollars 13m on sales of Dollars 228m in the 1992
period.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: China to impose freeze on
corporate bond issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA will place a freeze on enterprises issuing bonds in the latter part of
this year in an effort to curb a bond-issuing spree that has raised concerns
about the circulation of billions of yuan of worthless paper.
The English-language Business Weekly reported at the weekend that the
People's Bank of China, China's central bank, and the State Planning
Commission, were scrutinising all applications for new bond issues.
The paper quoted Mr Lu Pansheng, a central bank official, as saying that
bond issues that have not already been approved will be stopped.
Companies seeking working capital through bond issues will be asked to apply
for bank loans, the official said.
Some Yn20bn (Dollars 3.45bn) of corporate bond issues had been planned for
this year, but worries about the ability of enterprises to service their
commitments, and concerns about bonds draining money from the banking
system, have prompted the latest measures.
Steps to curb unrestrained bond issues by enterprises seeking funds to
expand their activities are part of a widespread crackdown by the Chinese
authorities on a financial sector that had mushroomed out of control.
China's efforts to cool its overheating economy include a squeeze on credit,
a demand that banks recall billions of yuan in loans for speculative
ventures such as property, and a strengthening of control over the countries
fledgling capital markets.
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, was
appointed last month to head the central bank. He wasted little time in
installing a new team of deputy governors to assist him in unravelling
China's financial morass.
Regulations issued earlier this month were also aimed at clamping down on
the bond issuing binge. These included the requirement that enterprises not
be permitted to issue bonds unless they had been profitable for the last
three years.
Proceeds from the issuing of corporate bonds could not be spent on real
estate speculation, securities, futures trading, or other risky investments
that are not related to the enterprise's central business.
Companies which float bonds without approval or provide an interest rate
higher than the one set by the central bank will be severely punished, the
report said.
No mention was made of China's capital raising abroad. China has embarked on
a fairly ambitious programme of international bond issues. These are almost
certain to be coming under careful central bank scrutiny.

Turtle sales

<TEXT>
PLAYMATES, the Hong Kong toy manufacturer which produces the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles, yesterday announced a further decline in earnings. First-half
1993 net profits fell 16.5 per cent, to HKDollars 146.6m (USDollars 18.9m).
The interim dividend is being cut from 7 cents a share to 6 cents.
At the peak of Turtle sales in 1991, the company posted six-month profits of
HKDollars 409m. However, the product's popularity has waned and the company
has failed to find an alternative source of income.
Turnover fell to HKDollars 600.6m from HKDollars 645.5m in 1992, despite the
success of the group's Star Trek product line.
In addition, associate contributions swung to a HKDollars 12.6m loss due to
a negative contribution from the 37.5 per cent-owned Ideal Loisirs of
France. The French toy group is expected to turn in a profit in the current
half-year.
Like many other Hong Kong manufacturers, Playmates has turned to property
development in an attempt to make up for dwindling profits from its toy core
business.
Director Mr Edmund Ip said the company's 'objective is to establish itself
as a quality developer concentrating initially on smaller sites in carefully
selected locations'.
Nintendo America, the US arm of the Japanese video game maker, announced
plans for a new generation of home video game machines using advanced
microprocessor and computer graphics technology provided by Silicon
Graphics, a leader in the field of advanced computer graphics, writes Louise
Kehoe. Nintendo said the new game machine would be available in 1995 at less
than Dollars 250.
The company, which is projecting Dollars 5bn in retail sales this year, will
invest a 'significant amount of money' to fund the joint venture while
Silicon Graphics will provide its MIPS microprocessors and graphics
technology.

COAL and Allied Industries, the Australian coal producer, has increased net
profits for the year to June by 23 per cent to ADollars 59.7m (USDollars
40.4m).
The result was achieved on a 7 per cent improvement in revenue to ADollars
657.4m. The company is stepping up its dividend from 60 cents to 70 cents a
share.
Coal production rose marginally from 11m to 11.1m tonnes, but sales rose
strongly from 11.1m to 11.9m tonnes.
Reviews of the underground operations led to significant reductions in
employee numbers during the year. The board is making a provision of
ADollars 35.1m before tax for diminution in the value of the assets.
That provision led to a net ADollars 28.4m abnormal loss but this was offset
by a ADollars 7.5m tax credit. Depreciation took ADollars 51.5m, against
ADollars 44.4m.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Dutch toughen bourse reforms
 -A look at efforts to return trading to Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE popularity of Dutch shares among foreign investors is proving to be a
curse as well as a blessing for the Amsterdam stock exchange.
Strong foreign demand for the likes of Royal Dutch, Philips and Heineken
means an alarmingly high percentage of trading in Dutch blue chips is now
conducted abroad - mainly on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation
(Seaq) system - rather than in Amsterdam itself.
For years, Amsterdam has tried to ward off London's attractions by
undertaking gradual reforms, such as abolishing stamp duty, encouraging
direct bloc trading between banks, and automating the flow of orders onto
the bourse floor.
However, these measures have had such little impact that the Amsterdam stock
exchange is now gearing up to push through more radical reforms early next
year.
According to Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, the bourse's chairman, the
difference between the earlier reforms and those scheduled for next year is
that 'this time we are going to tackle the very core of the trading system
itself'.
Until now, a central role on the Amsterdam exchange has been reserved for
hoeklieden, or stock jobbers, who bring together supply and demand by
setting prices in the stocks in which they specialise. Often
under-capitalised, and frequently criticised for their inability to take
large positions, the 'hoekmen' are the linchpins of a bourse which traces
its history nearly 400 years to the issue of shares by the Dutch East India
Company.
Under the proposed reforms, the 23 'hoekmen' firms will go, to be replaced
by no more than 10 market 'specialist' firms. At the same time, the market
will be divided into retail and wholesale segments. In another departure,
foreign brokers will be able to take part in the screen-based wholesale
market without being present in Amsterdam.
Seven foreign-based houses have already taken out special membership of the
exchange to participate in a new inter-professional trading system for Dutch
government bonds.
The retail market will remain the domain of the specialists. The wholesale
market will be based around Asset (Amsterdam Stock Exchange Trading System)
screens, Amsterdam's answer to Seaq. Completing the new look will be Aida,
an inter-professional dealing system modeled on Frankfurt's Ibes.
Although it is partially following Seaq's lead, Amsterdam is consciously
stopping short of adopting London's reliance on market-making. 'We think the
structure we'll have will be stronger than the one London has at the moment,
because they lack a retail side and the role of the specialist,' Mr van
Ittersum says.
The retail and wholesale sides of trading on the Dutch bourse will be
linked. Specialists will have to quote firm prices, a stipulation designed
to lend support and direction to the screen-based wholesale market, he says.
A crucial test of the new consensus in Amsterdam will come in the autumn,
when a committee of 'wise men' is due to make recommendations on buying out
the bourse's hoekmen, some of whom will be transformed into
better-capitalised specialists.
Job losses among the 200-strong staff are inevitable. Members will have to
approve the plan before the reforms can go ahead.
McKinsey, the consultancy group, published a report on trading in Dutch
shares in late 1992. Before then, any talk of doing away with the hoekman
was almost taboo. But McKinsey's survey of investors showed that 40 per cent
of trading in Dutch shares had leaked abroad, chiefly to London. The
situation in Dutch bonds was even bleaker, with just 32 per cent traded at
home, though this came as little surprise.
Perhaps the most worrying statistic was that just 33 per cent of 'bloc'
trades in Dutch shares, worth more than Fl 1m (Dollars 525,000), was
conducted in Amsterdam in 1991, against 68 per cent in 1988.
McKinsey also showed that investors, including Dutch ones, were unhappy with
Dutch banks and brokerages, complaining of uncompetitive rates and an
aversion to taking risks in the market. This accounted for the trend towards
seeking the services of foreign brokers, who in turn were more likely to use
Seaq than Amsterdam.
Mr van Ittersum said Dutch banks and brokers had now committed themselves to
playing an active part in the new system. They will, in any case, 'need to
stick their necks out' more if they want to continue to create a primary
market for the larger, internationally-orientated Dutch companies and to
serve the Netherlands' powerful institutional investors, he said.
He noted that of all Europe's bourses, Amsterdam was the most exposed to
competition from London. With a small home market and a preponderance of
international companies, it relies on foreign buying of shares and,
particularly, of bonds.
Because of its greater vulnerability, it is also 'the first bourse on the
continent that is ready to put a strategy vis-a-vis London into practice',
he said.

Sch1.9bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAU Beteiligungs (BBAG), Austria's leading brewery group, is seeking to
raise Sch1.9bn (Dollars 160.5m) through a rights issue for itself and a
warrant rights issue for its main subsidiary, Brau Union.
The group, which dominates the Austrian beer market with a share of more
than 60 per cent, has also disclosed first-half consolidated pre-tax profit
of Sch323m, up from Sch169m last year. All but Sch37m of the rise came from
property and share sales.
BBAG, one of Europe's largest brewing groups with annual output of over 8m
hectolitres of beer, has undergone a restructuring in the past year,
simplifying a complex web of cross-holdings among Austrian brewers. Two main
sub-groups, both quoted on the Vienna Borse, have emerged. Brau Union, in
which BBAG has a 66 per cent stake, holds all the group's brewing interests,
both in Austria and in eastern Europe. BBAG itself bottles soft drinks,
mineral waters and fruit juices.
BBAG's first-half consolidated sales were up 5 per cent to Sch5.2bn. Mr
Christian Beurle, chief executive, forecast at a press conference that
pre-tax profit would rise 19 per cent to Sch550m in the full year.
Proceeds from the rights issues are to be used for financing expansion
opportunities in eastern Europe. Both issues are on the basis of one new
share for every five held. Prices will be struck on September 30.
The BBAG issue is a conventional one, with a two-week exercise period. The
Brau Union issue will run for six months from October 22.
'It is really a rights issue disguised as a warrant,' Mr Walter Schuster,
deputy director of capital markets at GiroCredit Bank, said. Mr Schuster,
who conceived the idea, said the problem was that both companies wanted to
raise new capital, and their plan was for BBAG to go to the market this year
and Brau Union a year later.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley shares at new
high on record earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Morgan Stanley rose to a fresh high for the year yesterday after
the US securities house reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars
224.2m, or Dollars 2.77 a share. At the same stage last year the firm earned
Dollars 119m or Dollars 1.36.
Morgan Stanley's strong earnings easily surpassed the firm's previous record
of Dollars 198.8m, earned in the first three months of the current fiscal
year, and provided fresh evidence that the record-breaking boom on Wall
Street shows little sign of losing steam.
Demand for the company's shares in the wake of the results, which exceeded
many analysts' expectations, pushed the stock up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 79
5/8 , a new 52-week high, before closing at Dollars 78 7/8 .
Morgan Stanley's impressive performance was driven primarily by trading
revenues, which leapt 153 per cent to Dollars 517.9bn over the three months.
Although the sharp jump reflects increases in both customer-related and
proprietary trading revenues, earnings from the firm trading its own capital
in US and overseas financial markets, particularly fixed-income markets,
will have been especially strong.
Mr William Hartman, securities industry analyst at the banking group JP
Morgan, said: 'A lot of that (increase in trading revenues) came from
Europe. They were able to capitalise on declining European interest rates.'
The huge gains in trading revenues overshadowed improvements elsewhere.
Strong growth in financial advisory services and in high-yield and
structured debt underwriting boosted Morgan Stanley's earnings from
investment banking to Dollars 318.2m, up from Dollars 284.2m a year ago.
Revenues from broking commissions rose 17 per cent to Dollars 90.7m, while
asset management and administration revenues climbed 20 per cent to Dollars
63.6m. Interest and dividend revenues rose slightly to Dollars 1.48bn.
Overall, total revenues (excluding interest expense) rose to Dollars 11.5bn,
up from Dollars 764m a year ago.
Expenses climbed sharply because of a 54 per cent increase to Dollars 572.2m
in compensation and benefits payments, which are tied to the firm's
performance. Most of Morgan Stanley's other expense lines were little
changed in the quarter, and total non-interest expenses came in at Dollars
787.8m, compared to Dollars 568.9m a year earlier.

<TEXT>
COST-CUTTING and the weaker krona helped SSAB, the Swedish steel group, more
than double first-half pre-tax profits to SKr338m (Dollars 42.5m) from
SKr128m despite the difficult market conditions which continued to depress
sales.
The group, privatised last year, said it had cut processing costs by 5 per
cent since the 1992 first half and by 10 per cent since 1990. Staff numbers
have fallen by 2.5 per cent to 9,700 since the year-end.
Lower volumes led to a 2 per cent decline in sales to SKr6.35bn, even though
prices were 3 per cent higher in krona terms because of the weakening of the
Swedish currency.
The group's steel plate division, SSAB Tunnplat, lifted profits to SKr58m
from SKr16m, while the heavy plate unit boosted profits to SKr109m from
SKr55m. Both the building products division, Plannja, and the Tibnor trading
unit returned to the black, with profits of SKr33m and SKr13m respectively.
SSAB said it expected to make a profit in the second-half for the first time
since 1990. Last year it made a SKr165m loss.

UNI STOREBRAND has reached advanced stages of planning a spin-off of
Christiania General Insurance, the group's New York-based reinsurance
business, into a separate company listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
writes Karen Fossli.
Uni said a prospectus for an issue of Christiania General shares was almost
complete and that a valuation was almost finished. The company added that
limited group resources would in future prevent it from financing the
further development of Christiania General.
Earlier this year, Uni had considered either disposing of Christiania
General or seeking a strategic partner for the entity, but this had been
become difficult during a period of consolidation of the US reinsurance
market.
Credit Suisse First Boston, among others, are advising Uni on the move.
Christiania General has assets of Dollars 300m and is ranked 11 among US
reinsurers.
Last year the unit returned a surplus of about Dollars 120m under US
accounting principles, compared with a deficit of Dollars 125m in 1991.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Securities gains behind sharp
Uni Storebrand rise

<TEXT>
UNI Storebrand, Norway's largest insurance group, yesterday announced
sharply improved first half pre-tax profits to NKr689m (Dollars 94.8m) from
NKr79m in the same period last year, helped by substantial gains on
securities.
The group boosted net operating income to NKr10.93bn from NKr10.1bn. The
increase was achieved despite a loss in premium income by the life business
which saw market share decline by 2.8 percentage points to 31.9 per cent in
terms of premiums written during the last year.
Uni said group operating expenses had been cut by 2.67 per cent during the
six-month interim to NKr8.69bn from NKr9.3bn. Although the payroll was
reduced by 286 employees to 4,221 during the period, the full effect of cost
reductions is not yet apparent due to terms and conditions of voluntary
redundancy arrangements, the company explained.
Gains on securities hit NKr1.41bn, including a NKr213m net gain on the
disposal of the group's 25 per cent stake in Skandia, Sweden's biggest
insurer, against a loss of NKr690m last year.
Uni said unrealised gains on a consolidated basis rose by NKr1.5bn during
the second quarter and stood at NKr3.6bn at end-June. However, by the end of
last month unrealised gains had increased further to NKr3.81bn.
Uni pledged to place particular emphasis on quality assurance in future as
part of measures to regain market confidence in the group following its
release on July 13 from public administration.
Uni collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn debt taken on to but
the Skandia shares in a failed attempt to gain control of the company. The
group's shares were relisted on the Oslo bourse in mid-June and NKr4.3bn was
raised through share and bond issues in a major recapitalisation of the
group.
Uni said it made cash settlements to creditors last month whose claims had
fallen due and been approved. The settlements involved full payment of
principal, together with interest of about 11 per cent per year and reduced
Uni's external debt and cash holdings by NKr4.3bn.

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Dogfight in Canada's skies nears
climax - What has become a bitter and messy corporate battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BARRAGE of noisy volleys over the past fortnight suggests that the
drawn-out fight for survival between Canada's two main airlines is nearing a
climax.
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International are firing every weapon at
their disposal as each seeks supremacy in a battle which has become
increasingly frantic, but remains as confused and unpredictable as when it
began almost two years ago.
The only certainty is that both airlines, with combined debts of CDollars
4.2bn (USDollars 3.3bn), are bleeding profusely. Foreign carriers complain
that fare-cutting by the two combatants is severely undermining the
profitability of their Canadian routes. 'Whatever one does, the other will
do in spades,' says the representative of one European airline in Toronto.
Mr Ted Larkin, analyst at Bunting Warburg in Toronto, predicts that whatever
the outcome, the survivor (or survivors) will require a heavy injection of
equity.
The latest salvoes have come from Air Canada, which is desperately trying to
thwart a planned alliance between Canadian and AMR Corporation of Dallas,
parent company of American Airlines.
AMR would secure Canadian's future by infusing CDollars 246m of new capital
in exchange for a 33 per cent equity stake. But the US carrier has put a gun
to Canadian's head by setting an end-1993 deadline for the deal to be
finalised.
As an alternative to the American deal, Air Canada last week offered to pay
CDollars 200m for Canadian's offshore routes to Asia, Europe and South
America. It would also take over leases on the aircraft which currently fly
those routes, making the total deal worth about CDollars 1bn. Canadian would
be left as a domestic carrier.
Air Canada's offer, like other moves it has made, is shrewdly timed. As a
former quasi-state-owned corporation which was privatised in 1989, the
Montreal-based airline 'knows how to pull the levers of politics', one
Toronto analyst says.
The proposal comes on the eve of crucial votes on August 27 by shareholders
and creditors of PWA, Canadian's parent company, on a financial
restructuring. Air Canada's offer to take over some of the jewels of
Canadian's fleet means that senior creditors who hold the leases on these
aircraft can look forward to cash payments, rather than the near-worthless
common shares offered to them under PWA's restructuring plan.
Air Canada has also sought to defuse criticism that any solution other than
the deal with American would result in huge job losses at Canadian,
especially on its home turf in western Canada. Air Canada has offered, for
instance, to set up a wide-body jet maintenance base in Vancouver and to
employ all Canadian's international crews.
Meanwhile, the Montreal-based carrier has shored up public support on its
own doorstep by signing a tentative letter of intent last week to buy up to
48 Canadair Regional Jets from Bombardier, the transportation group whose
main assembly plant is also in Montreal.
Canadian has so far rejected Air Canada's overtures outright. Mr Rhys Eyton,
Canadian's chairman, called the bid for its routes part of 'a diabolical
plot' to kill his airline.
If nothing else, having to shrink Canadian from an international airline
flying to five continents to an insignificant domestic carrier would be a
severe humiliation. Canadian has its roots in Pacific Western Airlines,
which was a profitable regional carrier before it over-stretched by
swallowing Canadian Pacific Airlines and Wardair in the late 1980s.
Mr Larkin says, however, that Air Canada's latest proposal plus American's
year-end deadline have put Canadian against the wall. 'The options have
become more limited,' he says. 'Time is running out.'
Canadian has pleaded for the government to come to the rescue, though it has
yet to specify in what way. It argues that if the deal with American
collapses, thousands of jobs will be lost and the national interest damaged
by leaving Air Canada as an unfettered monopoly.
Loan guarantees from the federal and several provincial governments have
helped keep Canadian flying for the past year. But with a general election
looming, politicians are now more reluctant to become involved as they find
themselves torn between two high-profile companies, each with its own
powerful regional constituency.
The dilemma for the government is epitomised by the fact that Ms Kim
Campbell, the prime minister, comes from Vancouver, while her transport
minister, Mr Jean Corbeil, is a Quebecer.
Canadian's best (and perhaps last) hope of clinching the deal with American
lies with the quasi-judicial Competition Tribunal in Ottawa.
The tribunal will convene on September 8 to consider the latest of many
tortuous attempts by Canadian to extricate itself from the Gemini
computerised reservations system, which it owns in partnership with Air
Canada and a unit of United Airlines.
A condition of Canadian's entire deal with American is that Canadian sever
its ties with Gemini, and take its business to AMR's Sabre system. AMR wants
to use Canadian as a guinea pig and a showpiece for its business of
providing management services to airlines, other transport companies and
hotels.
Canadian contends that the dissolution of Gemini would preserve competition
in the airline industry. But Air Canada is fighting its rival's effort to
withdraw from Gemini, arguing that Canadian is legally bound to remain in
Gemini until 1999, and that its withdrawal would undermine the network's
viability.
The competition tribunal, which has considered the Gemini issue once before,
is expected to come to a quick decision. What that decision will be is
largely a matter of conjecture. One way or the other, however, it will
provide a pointer to the outcome of what has become one of Canada's most
messy corporate battles.

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Copymore advances to Pounds 758,000 at
midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COPYMORE, the USM-quoted office equipment company, lifted pre-tax profit
from Pounds 506,000 to Pounds 758,000 for the six months to June 30.
In part to compensate shareholders for the omission of a final dividend last
year, the interim is increased from 1p to 2.5p, payable from earnings of
4.5p (3p) per share.
Mr Stephen Matthews, chairman, said turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds
17.2m (Pounds 14.9m).
The result reflected the efforts of the sales team and determination to
control and centralise fixed costs, as well as integrating new acquisitions,
particularly National Technical Services.
As yet there was no real sign of recovery in the office automation market,
but he was confident of a satisfactory outcome for the year.
Combined full year service revenues from the acquired Solutions II group and
Concorde Copiers were expected to be Pounds 1.45m. Gearing had been cut from
134 per cent to 111 per cent. Interest cover improved to 6.8 times.
Mr Matthews is leaving the board at the end of the month to concentrate on
other interests.

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Return to profit at Aerospace Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPACE Engineering turned round from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.16m to a
profit of Pounds 214,000 in the year to April 30, adjusting for the FRS 3
accounting changes.
The final dividend is held at 0.5p. Following the cut at the interim stage,
however, that gives a total of 0.75p, against 1p. Earnings per share were
0.75p (losses 3.76p).
Mr John Davis, chairman and chief executive, said the recovery was achieved
after absorbing Pounds 122,000 (Pounds 1.12m) costs relating to disposal of
businesses, Pounds 51,000 (Pounds 742,000) restructuring costs, and against
difficult trading conditions in UK markets.
The aerospace sector, in particular, suffered from weak demand exacerbated
by severe competition in an over-supplied market, he pointed out.
Much of the improvement was the result of the programme to reduce costs and
gearing and improve efficiency, and also to the divestment of businesses.
Mr Davis said while UK demand for circuit boards remained patchy, overseas
sales were rising steadily. Conditions in the international aerospace
markets were still depressed.
The sale of Forward Industries in June had a significant impact on the
balance sheet, reducing debt by Pounds 2.61m. At the close of the year total
debt was Pounds 5.33m (Pounds 9.21m), supported by shareholders' funds of
Pounds 11.8m, reducing gearing from 79 per cent to 49 per cent.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 750,000 has been authorised for equipping a
new microwave circuit board facility and Pounds 500,000 in a new 'clean
room' status printed circuit board.

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hodgson confirms thirst for Hoskins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HOWARD Hodgson, one of the more flamboyant entrepreneurs of the 1980s,
yesterday returned to the London stock market as the biggest shareholder and
chief executive of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer.
The move, which ends almost a year of friction between the brewer's board
and disgruntled shareholders, added 20p to the company's shares when dealing
resumed on the USM after a three-month suspension. The shares closed at 76p.
Mr Hodgson said yesterday: 'I believe Hoskins represents an excellent
opportunity for us to expand the business into a substantial public company
with growing profits and earnings.'
He heads a new but experienced management team with Mr James Roe, a former
director of NM Rothschild, who becomes non-executive chairman; Mr Shaun
Dowling, chairman of Hartstone Group and a former director of Guinness, and
Mr Bill Caldwell, who retired last year after 22 years as a partner in Price
Waterhouse, are appointed non-executive directors.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand have been appointed as the company's financial adviser,
and Peel Hunt as its stockbroker.
Mr Hodgson has paid Pounds 303,500, or 55p a share, to acquire a 9.6 per
cent stake in Hoskins from the Hoar brothers who have been running the
company. Other members of his team have bought a further 3.4 per cent.
Mr Barrie Hoar, the former chairman, and Mr Robert Hoar, a director,
together with their families, have also disposed of another 9.5 per cent
holding which has been placed with institutions.
The Hoars, who have twice faced shareholder moves to remove them in the past
year, received about Pounds 715,000 from the deals which value the company
at Pounds 3.14m. The family retains a 7 per cent interest. Mr Barrie Hoar
will remain a non-executive director for the time being but his brother has
resigned from the board.
A group of dissident shareholders which had been challenging the Hoar
brothers' management of the company yesterday formally withdrew their
requisition for an extraordinary meeting.
Mr Hodgson approached the Hoars a week ago after the collapse of Hoskins'
negotiations with Swithland Estates, a private company run by Mr Adam Page,
former chairman of Midsummer Leisure. Swithland was proposing to reverse
some of its theme bar businesses into Hoskins - which owns four pubs as well
as a brewery - in exchange for 41 per cent of the equity.
'James Roe and I spent several months putting our team together and
searching for the right opportunity,' Mr Hodgson said.
The new team aims to increase distribution of Hoskins' beers, building
present production from 1,300 barrels a year to 5,000, but has no ambitions
to become a large-scale pub retailer.
'In view of the narrow base of its business operations, the company's best
long-term interests may well be served by developing the business into
complementary areas,' Mr Hodgson said.
The company plans to embark on a series of acquisitions though Mr Hodgson
said no targets had yet been identified.
'Our intention is to look for mature businesses, not start-ups or
turnrounds, that are cash generative and in expanding markets. Our small
head office - to which we have yet to recruit a finance director  - would
act as a portfolio manager, overseeing a number of profit centres rather
than getting involved in the day-to-day running of the businesses.'
Mr Hodgson used similar acquisitive tactics to build his family firm of
funeral directors, which he bought for Pounds 14,000, into PHKI, the UK's
largest quoted funeral services company with a capitalisation at one time of
Pounds 100m.
In the process, he transformed the public image of the undertaker by
introducing stretched Volvo limousines in midnight blue and dressing his
staff in Portland grey livery.
He was named USM Entrepreneur of the Year in 1987 but resigned as chairman
of the company in 1991, selling his shares for an estimated Pounds 6.5m.
Last year, he published a book about his experiences, entitled How To Become
Dead Rich.

Finsbury Smaller Companies Trust has announced that the 5.06m C ordinary
shares of Pounds 1 each, which were issued in the placing and open offer
that closed on July 9, will be converted on September 13 into new 25p
ordinary shares in the ratio of 0.96 shares for every C ordinary.
On this basis, the net assets attributable to the C ordinary shares were
Pounds 7.59m, equivalent to 1.5p per C ordinary and the net assets
attributable to the existing ordinary shares were Pounds 17.55m, equivalent
to 1.55p per existing ordinary share.
Therefore a total of 4.88m new ordinary shares will be issued on the
conversion of the C ordinaries.
In addition, the 1.51m C preference shares which were listed further to the
open offer which closed on July 9 will convert on a one for one basis into

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FLEMING Investment Trust Management is planning to launch an investment
trust specialising in the Chinese market, writes Philip Coggan.
The investment adviser will be Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong and the
stockbroker to the issue will be SG Warburg Securities.
Fund managers have been attracted to China in recent years because of the
country's high economic growth and its potential as it slowly introduces
capitalism. There are a limited number of shares on China's stock exchanges
in Shanghai and Shenzen but many managers invest in Hong Kong-listed
companies with Chinese operations.
The new trust is expected to be launched at the end of September.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LADBROKE, the hotels, racing and property group, has suffered a setback in
its long-running attempts to penetrate the French market for betting on
horse racing, the second largest in Europe after the UK.
The European Commission has turned down its complaint that Pari Mutuel
Urbain, France's monopoly tote operator, was infringing EC competition rules
by refusing to supply Tierce Ladbroke, its Belgian subsidiary, with
audio-visual images of French horse races.
Tierce Ladbroke is the leading bookmaker in Belgium, where its operations
along the French border have indirect access to France's horse racing.
Ladbroke claimed discrimination and abuse of a dominant position by PMU,
because the French monopoly supplies pictures and sound of French races to
Deutscher Sportverlag Kurt Sttof of Cologne for the use of German
bookmakers.
The EC has decided that PMU is entitled to choose, market by market, whether
or not to provide its services to off-track betting operators. PMU has
chosen not to do so at all within Belgium, the EC said. 'The situation would
be different if (it) decided to give licenses to certain bookmakers (in
Belgium) while refusing them to others.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Investments boost Hibernian to
IPounds 8.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIBERNIAN Group, the Dublin-based insurance and financial services company,
reported a 2.3 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits from IPounds
8.65m to IPounds 8.85m (Pounds 8.23m).
Increased underwriting losses of IPounds 8.46m (IPounds 6.35m) were more
than offset by a rise in investment income to IPounds 17.3m, up from IPounds
14.7m.
Mr Cecil Hayes, general manager finance, described the result as 'very
satisfactory,' pointing out that in the 1990 and 1991 first halves
underwriting losses were IPounds 13.5m and IPounds 11.1m respectively. Last
year's first half had been exceptionally good with no weather-related
claims, whereas the 1993 first half had suffered an increase in the number
and cost of claims.
The increase in investment income was attributed to strong cash flows and
the high levels of interest in Ireland in the early part of the year before
devaluation, and the rise in the equity and bond markets since.
Life profits were IPounds 53,000 (IPounds 313,000), reflecting the
development costs of an acquisition.
General insurance premium income rose 8.7 per cent to IPounds 89.6m (IPounds
82.4m) and life premium income rose to IPounds 49.3m (IPounds 21.1m).
Earnings per share increased to 11.3p (11p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 2.3p (2.1p).

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: GA plays down US asbestosis claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ACCIDENT, the composite insurance company, yesterday insisted that
it was fully reserved against asbestosis claims arising from a US court
judgment earlier this month.
Fears that GA's exposure to the claims, which arise from underwriting
operations in Australia, weakened the company's share price yesterday,
leading to a 5p fall on the day to 687p.
The claims concern public liability policies bought by CSR, the Australian
building materials and mining group, and were made by US workers injured by
asbestos mined and exported by a CSR subsidiary, Midalco, at the Wittenoom
asbestos mine in Australia.
The insurance policies in question were written between 1955 and 1978. In
the latest stage of a complex and long-running liability suit a Mississippi
court ruled against CSR on August 5. CSR was ordered to pay damages of
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) to four plaintiffs.
GA said yesterday that the risks were reinsured, that it was fully reserved
and that the claims were 'irrelevant in the context of GA's current level of
business.'
GA is also in litigation with CSR on these matters and a result was unlikely
to be reached for 'several years'.

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rea and UBS in Lloyd's venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REA BROTHERS, the small independent merchant bank, and UBS, a subsidiary of
the Union Bank of Switzerland, are joining forces to explore new investment
opportunities at the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
A pathfinder prospectus for a Pounds 35m investment trust backed by the two
groups and supplying capital to a range of Lloyd's syndicates could be
issued in early October.
The two groups aim to list Finsbury Underwriting Investment Trust on the
Stock Exchange.
A final decision to go ahead is dependent on the publication of a detailed
rule book governing the operation of 'incorporated Names' by Lloyd's early
next month.
Approval by existing Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets currently
supply the market's capital base, will also be required. Names are due to
meet on October 20 to vote on the market's initiative to attract corporate
capital.
'We are fairly confident that if rules are promulgated we can move ahead as
we plan to. But there are no guarantees,' said Mr David Lyons, a director of
Rea Brothers.
In particular, Lloyd's will need to reassure investors that they will not be
liable for liabilities arising from old insurance policies underwritten
before 1986. Lloyd's announced in April that it will transfer all such
liabilities to a new company, establishing a ring fence to protect new
investors.
'There must be absolute confidence that people will not be funding past
losses. The ring fence must work,' explained Mr Lyons.
Rea Brothers and UBS will work with Wren Underwriting Agencies and Finsbury
Asset Management.
Investments of some Pounds 35m will allow Lloyd's syndicates to accept up to
some Pounds 60m in premium income, making the scheme less ambitious than
some others currently being considered by a range of US and UK banks and
finance houses.
BZW and Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents are working on a scheme to
raise at least Pounds 100m to form a new investment company, while James
Capel and Samuel Montagu are involved in a separate scheme which could raise
up to Pounds 250m.
Kleinwort Benson is understood to be examining the formation of an
investment trust which support syndicates managed by Sturge Holdings.
Salomon Brothers, JP Morgan, SG Warburg, Phoenix Securities and Chase
Manhattan are among other companies involved in Lloyd's corporate capital
initiatives.
Lloyd's hopes to raise at least Pounds 500m in corporate capital boosting
capacity at the market in 1994 by Pounds 1bn.

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Inclemency corks future for HWC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hail and blight can now be added to over-expansion, crippling debt and
management incompetence on the list of main causes behind the collapse of UK
companies.
The Hungerford Wine Company has entered voluntary liquidation, in large part
because the harvests of 1991 and 1992 were rendered disastrous by
heaven-sent afflictions, according to Mrs Shirley Jackson, provisional
liquidator from Begbie Norton, the insolvency practitioner.
She said that HWC's cashflow had been hit by the lack of product to sell,
and this was in spite of no lack of customers in the fine wine market.
HWC specialised in the top sector of the fine wine market and especially in
the Bordeaux en primeur trade, selling to private consumers and collectors.
It has wine laid down in bonded warehouses for more than 1,500 customers.
Mr Nick Davies, owner and managing director, had explored all potential
routes to reconstruction, she said, but none had borne fruit. His main
concern now was to ensure that clients could take delivery of their wines,
perhaps on payment of a levy for storage and transportation.
Mrs Jackson herself is allergic to wine.

FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat shows sharp increase to
Pounds 6.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS PEAT Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur
Sir Ron Brierley which took over Brown Shipley Holdings in March, reported a
sharp rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993.
Profits came to Pounds 6.75m, compared with Pounds 3.15m for the nine month
period ended June 1992, when the company changed its year end.
GPG attributed the rise to a good performance from its main asset, Tyndall
Australia, the life assurance and fund management company in which it has a
56 per cent stake. In addition the group cited the unwinding of its joint
venture with Brierley Investments in Rossington, owner of the majority of
Australian Consolidated Investment, which has oil and brewing interests.
Turnover was steady at Pounds 13m, in spite of the difference in accounting
periods. Interest payable fell to Pounds 322,000 (Pounds 701,000).
GPG paid Pounds 5.6m for Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking
business arm of the UK merchant bank. Yesterday the group said the
acquisition had proved 'very complementary to GPG's UK operations.' It
contributed Pounds 280,000 after-tax in the last two months of the latest
period.
Mr Blake Nixon, GPG director, said the purchase of Brown Shipley was 'the
sort of thing we expect to do quite regularly in the UK.' The group would be
looking for companies that would respond to its skills.
Last November GPG regained its stock market listing after a suspension
lasting nearly two years. The suspension was imposed because GPG was
considered a shell company with no underlying business activity.
Mr Nixon said the suspension had held the company back. 'It tied us up in
huge amounts of non-productive work. Now we can focus on the basic
business.'
Earnings per share were 0.86p (0.71p) after payment of minority interests of
Pounds 1m (Pounds 661,000).
The shares closed yesterday at 28 1/2 p, up 2p on the day.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Bridgestone wakes from an American nightmare: Martin Dickson
analyses the Japanese company's problems in a foreign market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long American nightmare is finally over for Bridgestone, the Japanese
rubber company which found itself in severe difficulties after it snapped up
Firestone, the large US tyre manufacturer, in an ambitious Dollars 2.6bn
(Pounds 1.74bn) takeover five years ago. This is the first year since then
that Bridgestone/Firestone (BFS), the US company formed after the takeover,
will make an annual profit.
The newly confident company claims to be gaining ground in an intensely
competitive market - but so too does Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, the market
leader, which last month reported one of its best quarterly results ever.
Goodyear had an estimated 15.5 per cent share of the US replacement car tyre
market in 1992, compared with 7.5 per cent for Firestone and 3.5 per cent
for BFS's separate Bridgestone brand, according to Modern Tire Dealer
magazine.
The financial upturn is a welcome change for BFS, which lost Dollars 350m in
1990, Dollars 500m the following year and Dollars 146m in 1992 - even though
it broke even in the second half of last year.
And it is an important development for the company's Japanese parent, which
staked much of its future on the 1988 takeover. Before the deal, it was
number one in the Asian tyre market, but an also-ran elsewhere.
Bridgestone's problems in the US, and the way it has gone about solving
them, show that Japanese companies are far from infallible in penetrating
foreign markets, particularly when taking over another company rather than
building their own business from scratch.
'The problems of Firestone have proved to be far more difficult than anyone
expected,' says Mr Sunil Kumar, president of BFS's tyre sales business.
Originally, Bridgestone merely wanted to take a majority stake in the
Firestone tyre business, but it was pushed into a full takeover when Italy's
Pirelli launched a competing offer.
It knew that it would face some post-merger difficulties. When it bought a
truck tyre plant from Firestone in Tennessee in the early 1980s, it found
the equipment run down and labour relations poor.
Nevertheless, it remained ill-prepared for the sheer scale of modernisation
required and for the headaches of merging two corporate cultures, as well as
different manufacturing and distribution systems.
Bridgestone was forced in 1991 to pump an additional Dollars 1.4bn of
capital into the subsidiary to halve its debt.
The problems were compounded by the onset of recession in the US, which cut
demand for tyres, and by the Japanese company's 'kid gloves' approach to its
acquisition.
Rather than aggressively merging the two companies, it initially kept
Firestone's sales and marketing operations separate from Bridgestone's, thus
losing many of the cost advantages of the deal and fostering competition
between the two arms. 'They didn't want to do anything which might injure
Firestone,' says Mr Kumar. 'I think they ended up injuring everyone.' He
says there were numerous examples of Bridgestone salesmen calling on dealers
and trying to encourage them to buy Bridgestone tyres rather than Firestone.
However, BFS's fortunes turned for the better in 1991 when the parent
company adopted a more hands-on approach, despatching Mr Yoichiro Kaizaki, a
senior executive from Tokyo, to replace Mr George Aucott, the then chief
executive.
'He changed the attitude of everyone in the company,' says Mr Kumar.
'Before, everyone went around staring at their shoes feeling we were
losers.'
Mr Kaizaki, who returned to Japan last March to become president of
Bridgestone, rapidly consolidated the two marketing operations. He
reorganised the company into 21 independent business units, each with
responsibility for profits.
Whereas the two brands had previously been treated as 'separate but equal',
they were now 'together but unequal' - in other words aimed at different
market niches. Bridgestone tyres tend to have an up-market performance
image, while Firestone is more for the mass market.
Mr Kaizaki switched the group's headquarters from Akron, Ohio, where
Firestone was based, to Nashville, Tennessee, where Bridgestone had been
headquartered. Nashville offered a geographically central location and a
fresh beginning.
However, BFS is also benefiting from initiatives stretching back to 1988.
They include a Dollars 1.5bn manufacturing modernisation programme,
announced six months after the takeover; the transfer of Japanese
tyre-making technology, including a greenfield, state-of-the-art truck tyre
plant in Warren, Tennessee, about to undergo a Dollars 110m expansion; and
the introduction of Kaizan, continual manufacturing improvement through the
involvement of shopfloor workers.
All these factors, says Mr Kenji Shibata, BFS president, have improved
productivity, though it remains about 65 to 70 per cent of Bridgestone's
Japanese plants. He thinks this could rise to 95 per cent in five years.
Differing environmental and social costs mean that parity is unlikely.
Mr Masatoshi Ono, BFS chief executive, says that on the manufacturing side
the company still needs to become more flexible, shortening product
development times and coping better with small production runs. On the
marketing side, both brands need to be strengthened.
A survey of consumer satisfaction with tyres fitted on new cars, carried out
by the market research concern JD Powers, found both Bridgestone and
Firestone below the industry average in 1992, behind Pirelli, Michelin and
Goodyear. Mr Kumar says: 'It takes a while for the consumer to recognise
significant quality improvements.'
BFS has no grounds for complacency. It may be in the black, but competition
in the global tyre industry and excess manufacturing capacity is keeping
tyre prices depressed. It will be a considerable time before Bridgestone
gets a decent return on its US investment.

FT  24 AUG 93 / WPP cautious on fragile upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP GROUP, the marketing services company, remains cautious about an upturn
in its markets in spite of reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.1m, up
from Pounds 1.8m, in the half year to June 30. The result was helped by the
absence of last year's Pounds 13.5m restructuring charge.
Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said: 'The economic recovery, such as it
is, remains delicate and unsettled especially in the US and the UK. On the
basis of client experience to date, it is possible that a recovery will be
delayed for some time.'
The group is paying an interim dividend of 0.35p, as it forecast at the time
of its rights issue in March: the first payout since 1990. The shares rose
3p to 93p.
Reorganisation and rationalisation costs of Pounds 3.9m covered severance
pay. Operating profit before this cost rose to Pounds 46.5m (from Pounds
35.1m). Billings increased to Pounds 2.9bn (from Pounds 2.5bn) and group
revenues rose by 16.4 per cent to Pounds 699.8m, although more than 10 per
cent of that rise was due to the weaker pound.
Revenues in media advertising increased by 7.4 per cent in the first half. J
Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather generated net new business billings of
more than Pounds 156m (Dollars 235m) and Pounds 117m (Dollars 176m)
respectively.
However, while US advertising is showing signs of recovery, the group voiced
its concern about the extent to which President Clinton's tax proposals
could affect US companies, which in turn might cut back on their
advertising.
Public relation companies continued to lose money. Hill &amp; Knowlton and
Ogilvy Adams &amp; Rinehart reported combined losses of Pounds 4.8m, up from
Pounds 400,000.
Net debt fell to Pounds 372m (from Pounds 476m) resulting in a lower
interest charge of Pounds 15.6m (from Pounds 20.5m).
The average net debt figure reflects three months of proceeds of its Pounds
85m rights issue.
The group hopes to reduce borrowings further with the sale of Scali McCabe
Sloves, the US agency. That sale is expected to fetch between Dollars 40m
(Pounds 26.8m) and Dollars 60m.
In the long-term, WPP is considering the flotation of its market research
activities in south-east Asia and the sale of one or two smaller companies.
Earnings per share of 2.5p compare with a loss of 7.6p.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Texas Homecare recruits chief executive amid board changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Homecare, Ladbroke's DIY chain, yesterday announced a shake-up at the
top. It appointed Mr John Coleman, former managing director of the Dorothy
Perkins chain, as chief executive. It also revealed that Mr Ron Trenter,
Texas chairman, would move shortly to another position within Ladbroke.
The announcement, in the wake of rumours that Mr Cyril Stein, Ladbroke's
chairman, was about to retire, may lead to speculation that Mr Trenter is
being groomed to succeed him.
Analysts said this was unlikely, as Mr Peter George, vice-chairman, had long
been seen as heir apparent to Mr Stein. Ladbroke would say only it had
'something lined up' for Mr Trenter, but could not reveal what this was. It
said it originally intended to replace Mr Peter Hartley, the Texas managing
director who left in July after 'differences of opinion' with Mr Trenter,
with another managing director. But its search process produced candidates
of such quality that it decided to make Mr Coleman chief executive, enabling
Mr Trenter to move on - something he was keen to do after 20 years at Texas.
Mr Coleman assumes his role, and a seat on Ladbroke's board, on September
13. Mr Trenter is expected to stay until Christmas to ensure a smooth
handover, but will then leave Mr Coleman effectively to fill the roles of
chairman and chief executive.
Texas will be hoping Mr Coleman's appointment will restore stability after
several management changes. In addition to Mr Hartley, Mr Peter Hallett,
finance director, left in June for Hobson, the toiletries group.
Mr Coleman joins Texas at a difficult time. A price war among the main DIY
chains last year resulted in a fall in profits at Texas - number two in the
market with an 8 per cent share - from Pounds 47.5m to Pounds 43.5m, and
trading remains tough. Ladbroke announces interim results on September 2,
with Texas expected to disclose a 27 per cent fall in profits to about
Pounds 19m.
Mr Coleman left Dorothy Perkins in April, officially because of differences
in management style. But there were stories in the trade that he was talking
to headhunters about other senior retail positions - including the chief
executive's role vacated by Mr David Dworkin at Storehouse.

FT  24 AUG 93 / MAN cuts payout on 45% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAN, the German trucks and engineering group, is to cut its dividend to
DM8.50 from DM12 last time following a 45 per cent profits slump in the year
to the end of June.
Net earnings fell from a record DM418m (USDollars 261m) to a provisional
DM230m on sales of DM19bn, down 1 per cent on the previous financial year,
the group said in an interim report yesterday.
There had been no improvement in business conditions since publication of
the company's half-year report in February, it added. The backlog of
outstanding orders totalled DM14bn at the end of the year under review, 15
per cent lower than in 1991-92.
Incoming orders for the year were down 8 per cent at DM16.6bn. While foreign
demand was up 2 per cent, domestic orders were 20 per cent lower at DM6.7bn.
Although that suggests improvement from the first half, when total new
business was down 14 per cent, the group showed few signs of optimism.
However, it said, after climbing steadily through the year, incoming orders
in the fourth quarter, at DM4.8bn, were 5 per cent above the last quarter of
the previous year.
MAN, Germany's second-biggest truck maker after Mercedes-Benz, said
personnel cuts would have to continue, particularly in commercial vehicles
and the MAN Roland printing machinery divisions.
The group has shed nearly 6,000 workers, approximately 9 per cent of its
payroll, since mid-1991. Profit figures for this year include provisions for
3,300 more job losses in the current year.
Demand for commercial vehicles was down 13 per cent on the year, while
orders for engineering products and plant were 6 per cent lower. An 11 per
cent rise in turnover from trading activities helped offset a fall of 8 per
cent in trucks and no change in engineering sales. Vehicles account for
about 40 per cent of group sales and more than half of its annual earnings.
German industry was still in deep recession, the report said, and capital
investment was falling faster. Weaknesses in most European markets had been
exacerbated by devaluations against the D-Mark, while improvements in the US
economy had still not had any discernible effects on the group's business.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Executive at Euro Disney to leave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN FORSGREN, vice-chairman of Euro Disney, plans to leave the troubled
European leisure group to return to an unspecified position with Walt
Disney, its US parent company.
Euro Disney, which has this summer been clouded by controversy about its
financial performance and future prospects, confirmed that Mr Forsgren would
be returning to the US. However, it said details of the move, and his new
role at Walt Disney had not been finalised and meanwhile he would remain as
its vice-chairman.
The departure of Mr Forsgren, one of Euro Disney's most senior executives
and finance director at the time of the opening of the Euro Disneyland theme
park in April last year, comes at a sensitive time. Euro Disney, which is
burdened by heavy debt and deeply in the red, has been forced to ask Walt
Disney for financial support.
Mr Forsgren, 46, joined Euro Disney in January 1990 to help orchestrate its
launch. He joined after four years as treasurer of Walt Disney, which owns
49 per cent of the European company.
In April this year Mr Forsgren was replaced as Euro Disney's finance
director by Mr Mike Montgomery, another former Disney treasurer. Mr
Montgomery has taken charge of financial affairs reporting directly to Mr
Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, and has played a leading part in
preparations for a financial restructuring.
Mr Forsgren has since April been vice-chairman. Euro Disney said at the time
of his appointment that he had been promoted to deal with the investment and
political communities.
Euro Disney said yesterday that Mr Forsgren's return to the US was part of
the routine process of repatriating US executives. Mr Forsgren, now at his
holiday home in Connecticut, has spent most of the summer in the US.
Euro Disney's share price fell sharply last week following press speculation
about the group's problems, It dropped from FFr56.80 to FFr54.50 when the
market opened yesterday but recovered to close at FFr56.00.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, analyst at Morgan Stanley in London said:
'Euro Disney is in a dire situation and investors are very nervous.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / Brussels asked to rule on Britain's equal pay laws:
Ministers will see watchdog's move as provocative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S equal pay laws are to be legally challenged through the European
Commission in separate actions by the government-appointed Equal
Opportunities Commission and the TUC.
In an unprecedented move the EOC, a statutory body accountable to the
government, will next month ask the Commission to decide if Britain's equal
pay legislation complies with EC regulations.
The EOC could find itself on a collision course with the government over
what ministers will regard as a provocative move.
The organisation's decision to refer the issue to the Commission reflects
its increasing exasperation at what it regards as the government's failure
to comply with Community legal obligations on equal pay.
The main reason for the EOC's appeal to Brussels is the negative response it
received last month from Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, over the
issue.
In a letter dated July 19, he rejected out of hand the EOC's proposals to
strengthen existing equal pay legislation.
These called for: a speed-up in the slow and complex procedure in equal pay
inquiries; an extension in equal pay award entitlements, beyond the
individual claimant, to all workers in the same employment doing the same or
similar work to entitle them to the same award; and a move to allow
discriminatory terms in a collective agreement to be challenged by an
interested party or modified by a trade union.
In his letter Mr Hunt also turned down the legal advice given to the EOC by
leading counsel that the government had failed to fulfil its obligations
under the Treaty of Rome and the equal pay directive which Britain signed in
1975.
The employment secretary told the EOC the government needed to strike a
balance between improving the law and ensuring employers could avoid burdens
that would threaten job opportunities.
Mr Hunt also said he was firmly opposed to any proposals that sought to
award equal pay to others in similar jobs or to allow trade unions or the
EOC to challenge discriminatory pay systems.
The EOC pointed out that it had been trying unsuccessfully for over three
years to convince the government that it should improve existing equal value
legislation. 'We have decided enough is enough,' the EOC said. The EOC's
detailed reference to Brussels is now being finalised.
Yesterday the EOC also welcomed the TUC's decision to make a formal
complaint to the Commission over the abolition of wages councils, which
comes into force on August 30.
It said it shared the TUC's concern that the abolition 'will worsen the pay
gap between women and men and dismantle one of the most practically
effective ways of maintaining equal pay for women'.
But the Department of Employment said last night that UK legislation fully
complied with the government's EC obligations and it did not accept that
abolishing the wages councils breached either the equal pay directive or the
Treaty of Rome.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Government tries to defuse rail fares row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday attempted to defuse the growing political
controversy over leaked plans to raise some rail fares within London by 16
per cent.
An FT analysis, meanwhile, shows that fares on Network SouthEast - as well
as London Underground and London's buses - have risen consistently ahead of
inflation since 1984, when the Greater London Council, led by Mr Ken
Livingstone, cut prices.
Since then, while the retail price index rose by 55.3 per cent, bus fares
have risen by 92.3 per cent and tube fares by 94.5 per cent. Network
SouthEast registered an 81.7 per cent rise.
Since 1979, the distance which can be travelled on any London public
transport system for a set fare has been cut by 20 per cent.
Lord Caithness, a transport minister, sought yesterday to play down the
prospect of steep fare increases on Network SouthEast rail services, and
emphasised that suggestions that some fares could rise by 16 per cent were
hypothetical.
'It is quite natural that British Rail should look at various options, and
you are bound to throw up a range of alternatives. Then what happens - and
it is the process that is happening now - is that it is discussed between BR
and ministers,' he told BBC radio.
The scale of the possible increases has alarmed Tory MPs in the south-east.
Sir Keith Speed, a leading Tory rebel over rail privatisation, was certain
neither BR nor Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, would agree to
the sort of rises envisaged in the leaked papers.
Local elections in London next May are adding to the political sensitivity
of decisions on fares, as the 'preferred option' in the leaked document
would see the steepest increases for Travelcards, used in the greater London
area.
One of the Tory rebels over rail privatisation, Mr Andrew Bowden, the MP for
Brighton Kemptown, warned that the government must get the right balance
between fare rises and subsidy. He agreed there should be a 'reasonable'
increase, but insisted it should not be 16 per cent.

British Rail's management seems wedded to the notion that the best way to
raise net revenues at times of weak demand is to cut services and raise
prices. Such an attitude comes naturally to a monopoly which believes it can
shamelessly exploit a captive customer base. Even in Network SouthEast's
commuterland, it is starting to look old-fashioned.
Sooner or later a policy of charging more for less will lead inexorably to
lower rather than higher revenues. If nothing else, private ownership of
rail would surely see a more imaginative approach to revenue generation.
Increased usage might even produce a lower unit cost, for all that expensive
track and signalling infrastructure.

FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The banks which agreed to last year's debt-for-equity swap at WPP may be
pleasantly surprised by the recent run of the shares. Yesterday's closing
price represents a handsome premium over the level at which their preference
shares can be converted next week. Little wonder that most fully intend to
exercise that option and take profits, rather than hang on in the hope of
more.
The conversion will act as a drag on the shares, since buyers will have to
be found for around 11 per cent of WPP's share capital. The situation is
likely to recur next year when the banks are free to convert their remaining
prefs. Longer term prospects turn, though, on WPP's ability to generate more
revenue while keeping a lid on costs. Revenue growth of 5 per cent in the
first half - once exchange rate movements are stripped out - and a slight
improvement in margins is thus encouraging.
But with recession taking hold in Europe and only a sluggish recovery in the
US, that rate of progress can not be taken for granted. Discounting in
markets from cigarettes to detergent also poses a threat to the branded
goods companies on which WPP depends. One response by its clients would be
to defend market share and the remaining price differential of branded goods
over generic products by increasing marketing spend. The worrying
alternative would be to defend margins by taking an axe to advertising.

<TEXT>
The modest queue of corporate financiers forming outside Lloyd's must be
heartening for the management of the stricken insurance market. Whether
investors will be tempted to put money into Finsbury's trust or any of the
other investment vehicles waiting in the wings remains an open question.
Since the terms on which corporate capital might be admitted will not be
decided by Lloyd's council until next month - and not put to the vote until
October 20 - there can be no sure answer.
For corporate capital to stand a chance of participating in the 1994
underwriting year, the bankers will have to move fast thereafter. Finsbury
has opted for an investment trust; Sedgwick and BZW are working on a quoted
investment company. US investment banks will doubtless have their own novel
ideas. All will stand or fall, though, on their ability to pick winners
among underwriting syndicates.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The replacement of Texas Homecare's chief executive is hardly a sign that
everything is going swimmingly in do-it-yourself. Thus far, the gentle
upturn in housing transactions has done little for DIY retailers, with
consumers reluctant to spend on fixtures and fittings. Last year's fierce
price wars have been replaced by the image of consistent low pricing, but
DIY retailers have only been able to hold volumes in recent times at the
expense of margins. Texas had the upper hand last year, B&amp;Q this. Poor old
Do It All has been knocked from pillar to post between them. Meanwhile,
expectations of a return to the glory days of the late 1980s are more
desperate hope than expectation, and the market will not prosper until
substantial capacity is taken out.
The most obvious casualty is Do It All, which requires either drastic
pruning or complete uprooting. Yet with alternative use values for the out
of town sites so low, the cost of exit is almost unbearable. Boots' strong
cash flow might allow it to take the pain of closing Do It All, but its
partner WH Smith is not so well placed. Smiths may well show a cash outflow
when it reports full-year figures tomorrow, and its smaller balance sheet
would be hard pressed to take the strain. If that means that the agony is
doomed to continue in the sheds which only cost DIY shopkeepers Pounds
2m-Pounds 3m, what might happen to food retailers faced with a similar
plight in air conditioned freehold barns costing Pounds 25m apiece?

FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Marking the French test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
France's decision first to cut and then suspend its overnight lending rate
shows its markets are returning to normal after the ERM crisis. With luck,
it may now be possible to complete that process by cutting the five-to-10
day lending rate. But France will only be breaking new ground when it starts
cutting its intervention rate, which sets an effective floor for the money
market. For that, the authorities will probably still keep at least half an
eye on developments beyond the Rhine.
August inflation figures for Baden-Wurttemberg will today give an indication
of the Bundesbank's room to cut interest rates this week. A monthly price
rise of 0.2 percentage points or less might prompt a small cut in the German
discount rate. That could allow France to cut its own intervention rate
without jeopardising the franc. But with year-on-year inflation above 4 per
cent, the Bundesbank may yet do nothing at all.
As long as France clings to the vestiges of its strong currency policy, that
would be awkward. All the more so since the change at the top of the
Bundesbank, and a money supply bloated by intervention, means a period looms
when further German rate cuts will be difficult. Thus far, exchange markets
have welcomed successive cuts in France's overnight rate. Any interruption
to the process may see them again worrying about economic recovery. If the
franc is to be weak anyway, the French economy might as well enjoy lower
interest rates as well.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Cookies offer food for thought: RJR Nabisco has cut its
debts, but can it compete as a single group in the world of snacks and
cigarettes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To lose a chairman may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose a finance
director as well looks like carelessness. For RJR Nabisco, the US-based food
and tobacco group - best known for its Camel cigarettes and Oreo 'cookies' -
this year's calamities do not stop there. Over the same period it has seen
its most profitable business, US cigarettes, wracked by a price war, and has
been forced to abandon an ambitious Dollars 1.5bn special shares offering.
It has watched its share price dip to Dollars 5 1/4 , less than half the
level at which it was sold to investors two years ago.
The long list of problems have raised the question again of whether the
company should be split between food and tobacco groups. In the wake of the
aborted Dollars 1.5bn 'food share' issue this summer, which would have been
tied to the performance of the Nabisco food division, a typical
stockbroker's report commented: 'This represents one more thing gone wrong
and one more reason to avoid the stock.'
The only person who seems publicly relaxed is the new chairman, Charles
'Mike' Harper. 'I don't know that we're in a bind,' he remarked cheerfully.
'It's a whole wide wonderful world out there.'
But even Mr Harper would not deny that today's grim reality is far removed
from the promises made in 1989 when RJR Nabisco was the subject of a
record-breaking Dollars 25bn bid masterminded by the financier Mr Henry
Kravis, co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis, Roberts, the New York-based leveraged
buy-out specialist.
Then, the bidders talked about streamlining; about the disciplines which a
heavy debt burden would impose on management; about the merit of shedding
corporate 'fat', such as private jets, and investing long-term to build
brands.
When the bid battle ended in victory for Kohlberg Kravis, Roberts, the
financial world held its breath. It was the biggest buy-out in corporate
history and marked the zenith of the feverish period of leveraged deals in
the 1980s, when takeovers were funded by innovative debt instruments such as
junk bonds.
Today, the widespread view on Wall Street is that RJR Nabisco has avoided
many of the financial problems which have beset smaller leveraged deals.
Companies ranging from Federated Department Stores to Trans World Airlines
found that once recession struck, operating profits were insufficient to
meet debt payments and had to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy code.
Operating cash flow at RJR Nabisco has been sufficient to meet debt
repayment demands, and about half the total acquisition debt of close to
Dollars 30bn has been paid off. The large US credit-rating agencies, such as
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, moved the company up from junk bond to
investment grade status last year, thus confirming its financial health.
The reduction in borrowings was helped by a programme of disposals which,
although not trouble-free, was completed largely as planned. The main
elements were the sale of RJR Nabisco's European snack and biscuit companies
to BSN, the French food group, and the disposal of Del Monte, the fresh and
canned fruits business. More than Dollars 6bn has flowed in from these
sales.
But while the balance sheet has steadily improved, progress in terms of
industrial strategy has been less satisfactory. On the tobacco side, RJR was
struggling to demonstrate any sustained sales or profits advance in its
single most important domestic business, long before rival cigarette marker,
Philip Morris, slashed the price of its Marlboro' brand and brought a
simmering price war to boiling point.
Domestic tobacco is critical to RJR Nabisco's fortunes in the short term,
accounting for about 60 per cent of group operating profit. RJR's two main
full-priced brands - Winston and Salem - lost market share in the early
1990s as discount brands grew in popularity. Only Camel, a smaller brand,
made progress on the back of a successful, if controversial, Old Joe Camel
advertising campaign which critics claimed enticed children to smoke.
Recently, RJR redirected its attention to the discount end of the US
cigarette market, and its total market share improved. But the gain was
largely at the lower-margin end of the sector, so while sales rose 5 per
cent to Dollars 6.16bn last year, operating profits for the domestic tobacco
division declined by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn in the 1992 calendar year.
The food side has struggled for different reasons. Shorn of its main
international interests, Nabisco became heavily dependent on the US domestic
market. But recession and the squeeze by retailers' own-label products on
branded goods suppliers have meant that profits improvements had to be
clawed out of cost-savings and productivity gains. In 1992, food sales were
flat in North America, and the division's 'business unit contribution' -
core operating profits ahead of asset sale proceeds - rose only 3 per cent.
Such was the state of the company when Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR Nabisco's
chairman since the 1989 bid, departed to run International Business Machines
in April. His departure proved tough for the company to handle. Seeking to
minimise disruption - and knowing that the sensitive 'food share' issue was
in the pipeline - RJR Nabisco announced that two other members of Mr
Gerstner's small head office team would become co-chairmen and chief
executive officers.
At the company's annual meeting just days after Mr Gerstner left, Mr
Lawrence Ricciardi, general counsel, and Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance
director, performed a polished double-act. But the carefully-engineered
harmony was disrupted two months later when Mr Harper arrived. Although many
observers had suspected that the two-man chairmanship would prove temporary,
the impression of a well-organised handover had been marred by Mr
Ricciardi's earlier insistence that the dual arrangement was not short term,
and Mr von der Heyden's resignation when the appointment of Mr Harper was
announced.
He is no stranger to the rough-and-tumble of the US food industry. In the
early 1970s, he quit Pillsbury (now owned by the UK's Grand Metropolitan)
when it sold the poultry business which he headed. He moved on to run
ConAgra, then a commodity-based business which had just lost large sums on
the futures markets and was close to collapse. Slowly, Mr Harper started to
buy up packaged food operations which other companies had rejected -
including several from RJR Nabisco. Today, ConAgra brands include Wesson
cooking oil, Hunt's ketchup, Armour meats and La Choy chinese foods.
But it was Mr Harper's move, in 1985, into 'healthy packaged foods' that
really made his name in the industry. He apparently conceived the idea while
in hospital recovering from a heart attack. After his release he set about
developing ConAgra's Healthy Choice line of frozen entrees. The products
were a big success, ConAgra's fortunes blossomed, and Mr Harper became one
of the food sector's most respected executives, despite the entry of rivals
into the business.
Today, as boss of RJR Nabisco, he is quick to draw parallels between the
company and the ConAgra of the 1970s. 'There are lots of ways to make
money,' he says, 'and there is no magic in increasing earnings per share.
'With ConAgra, we started with a debt-to-equity ratio of six to one. Over a
period of time, and by doing a few little things very well, we focused on
increasing value from a shareholders' point-of-view. And that came down to
getting good returns from any new capital that we put into the company.'
What, in the context of RJR, might these 'little things' be? Mr Harper is
loathe to discuss specifics, but outlines a few possibilities.
First, acquisitions will be a priority. 'We intend to pursue opportunities -
food and tobacco. Or it could be something else. I'm not going to commit
myself to saying that it would be only food and tobacco.'
This presupposes that both divisions remain under the same corporate roof.
It was widely assumed that RJR Nabisco only attempted the complex 'food
share' issue because of the immense legal obstacles of a full demerger. Bond
holders and litigants in tobacco liability lawsuits would have been unhappy
in any case, while complicated debt covenants might have to be bought off.
In the wake of the aborted stock offer, speculation that RJR Nabisco is
reconsidering this possibility has mounted, however.
Mr Harper is non-commital: 'Anything that's moral, ethical and legal will be
done, but it would be inappropriate to speculate on any particular
possibility.'
On the food side, Nabisco has been trying to rebuild its international
operations via a handful of fairly modest deals, centred largely on Latin
America. This, says Mr Harper, will continue.
'I think the food division will continue to build on that base, and that's
very logical. We don't want to get into a no-growth business in a
slow-growth economy. That might suggest that in certain parts of Europe it
could be difficult to find businesses. But I don't care where we find them,
so long as they are growth vehicles and can be purchased at a price which
will give us a darned good return.'
Second, product innovation will be important. Mr Harper is quick to attack
the widespread notion that RJR Nabisco has been tardy in introducing new
brands. 'I think the food managers have done a pretty good job of product
development. They've brought out a great line of snacks, and now they're
coming out with potato chips that have half the fat. These have never been
near a deep-fat fryer, and they taste tremendously good.' Mr Harper points
out that 10 per cent of sales come from products brought to market in the
past two years.
Third, fresh management objectives are being set. 'The company has focused
for a long time on the balance sheet - and thank goodness for that. Now the
focus is changing. Sure, there are going to be some more financings. But the
focus of management is to make more money. It's a natural shift at this
point in time.
'So there will be goals, there will be standards, there will be financial
objectives. We will establish those; we will expect results.'
But if a steady rebuilding of RJR Nabisco - with emphasis on the food side -
is Mr Harper's aim, does the company have enough resources to pursue it
effectively? One drawback is that while many food industry competitors can
concentrate on that sector alone, RJR Nabisco has the uncertain cost of a
cigarette price-war to contend with, plus a still-substantial debt burden.
Moreover, its lowly share price and the withdrawal of the 'food stock' issue
suggest that new equity financing may be out of the question for a while.
The answer, say some observers, lies in basic mathematics. The company is
reckoned to generate 'free cash-flow' - profits flowing into the company
with depreciation costs added back - of just over Dollars 4bn a year. About
Dollars 2.9bn is needed annually to pay interest on the debt, taxes and for
planned capital expenditures. This leaves about Dollars 1.2bn annually to
pay off debt and to fund acquisitions.
How much of this balance will be consumed by the cigarette price-war is
unknown; 'several hundred million' is the vague consensus on Wall Street.
Future debt maturities, meanwhile, are reckoned to be 'fairly modest at an
average of Dollars 200m annually over the next few years', according to
Fitch, the debt-rating agency.
So are the company's resources enough to juggle acquisition spending with
product development demands and marketing requirements? 'Live with it?' Mr
Harper says. 'We can be aggressive with it.
'Even with this price-war in cigarettes, we have substantial cash-flow.
Relative to interest, it is very good, and even after the great reduction in
the operating income from tobacco, it is still very good. Some food people
would think they'd died and gone to heaven.'
RJR Nabisco's shareholders, however, may feel that heaven is a little way
off. Partly as a result of the cigarette price war, many industry watchers
predict a fall in after-tax profits this year; some suggest that it may even
be uphill work to show any recovery in 1994. Not least of those concerned is
Kohlber Kravis, Roberts, which still holds a controlling interest in the
company. Three years after the takeover, RJR Nabisco's management is
increasingly being measured by its ability to deliver in the real world of
biscuits, nuts, crackers and cigarettes, not by its skill in handling a
balance sheet, slashing costs or shuffling assets. On that score, Mr Harper
would seem to have his plate full. Mr Kravis can only join other investors
in hoping Mr Harper's optimism is well-founded.

A BBC television play called The Vision Thing, which is due for screening in
October, must be causing some stage fright at one high-flying City public
relations firm.
The play concerns a clever young PR flack whose smooth charm lands him the
job of spokesman for the Tory party. One thing leads to another, and, as a
reward for a spot of deceit and cover-up at election time, he is given the
job of foreign secretary. Sad to say this promising career comes to an
abrupt halt in a now predictable way.
His illicit affair with a glamorous young interior decorator is exposed
after their pillow-talk is bugged by GCHQ and subsequently picked up by a
retired building society manager who also happens to be an amateur radio
operator.
Not much to worry about in that - except that the central role is played by
one Nathaniel Parker, son of Sir Peter Parker, chairman of the Young Vic,
and brother of Alan Parker, the smooth-talking boss of Brunswick, the City
PR firm whose rapid rise to fame was crowned by its handling of the BT3
flotation.
So uncanny is the resemblance that viewers who switch on half way through
might even think they are watching a cinema verite documentary about the
comeuppance of Alan.
One only hopes they will be properly able to distinguish fact from fiction.

Who is behind MBNA, the major American bank which hit the headlines last
week by getting a Pounds 7m grant out of the DTI to build a Pounds 43m
headquarters in Chester? Whoever it was must have spun a good yarn to get
that sort of treatment.
The DTI and the Department of Employment could not elaborate on the brief
press release, and even the Bank of England admitted that MBNA had only got
its banking licence a few days before the announcement. However, it sounds
like a bank in a hurry, judging by the career of Alfred Lerner, its
60-year-old chairman.
Lerner is one of those irrepressible sorts who just won't let a little
mishap get him down. Having made his first fortune in real estate, his
second career as an investor in bank stocks seemed in danger of coming
unstuck when he sunk Dollars 158m into the Baltimore-based bank MNC, parent
of Maryland National which had run into problems with dodgy property loans.
Lerner even disappeared briefly from the Forbes list of the richest people
in the US. But not for long. In order to rescue MNC from its financial
problems, Lerner helped spin-off its successful credit card operations as
MBNA in 1991, and has never looked back. He earned Dollars 139m last year,
according to Financial World magazine's annual survey of Wall Street pay.

If Tarmac does press the button and have its rumoured rights issue soon,
will the company mark the occasion by changing its chairman?
Sir Eric Pountain, who turned 60 earlier this month, has had a good innings
and handed over the executive reigns to Neville Simms early last year. Along
with Graeme Odgers and Bryan Baker, he was the reason Tarmac was regarded as
one of the best-managed companies in its field in the early 1980s.
However, he was not the best chairman for a recession and Tarmac now needs
an injection of new equity to repair its earlier mistakes. Having a powerful
former chief executive on the board can often make life difficult for a new
chief executive keen to put his own stamp on the company.
Ten years ago Tarmac was the biggest in its sector. Today, in terms of
market capitalisation, Blue Circle is nearly twice as big and Redland almost
three times. If Sir Eric does choose to bow out, Sir John Banham seems the
most likely internal candidate to succeed him.

Would you run a mile for a burger? No, neither would Observer. But Steve
Cram is hoping that his athletic exploits will inspire fast food fans to
cram into Heroes of Sport, a chain of family restaurants he is about to
launch. Hard on the heels of the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, Cram's
cafes will feature sporting memorabilia, rather than the film and pop
souvenirs normally associated with such places.
While Cram eventually plans to satisfy the appetites of Manchester,
Birmingham, Sheffield, Coventry and central London, his first venue will
open in Newport, south Wales, in October. Let's hope it proves more
successful than Newport County Football Club which went belly-up and dropped
out of the league in 1988.

<TEXT>
No wonder former countries of the Soviet Union are keen to hear from Pope
John Paul II. The mere mention of a papal visit seems to work miracles for
the exchange rate of the country in question, judging by Lithuania's
experience.
Ever since word leaked out that the Pope was planning to visit the Baltic
state in September, Lithuanian's currency, the litas, has soared. Last
month, the rate was five to the dollar; now the going rate is 2.8 litas to
the dollar. Demand for the currency is based on expectations that foreign
visitors flocking to Lithuania to see His Holiness will lead to a glut of
hard currency.
If this scenario proves correct, then the Vatican can expect an early call
from the Ukraine. According to Morgan Stanley, Ukraine's karbovanetz has
fallen by 90 per cent against the dollar since December.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KENNETH CLARKE was chancellor of the exchequer in waiting long before he
became chancellor. He may already be regretting his temerity. By now he
should be painfully aware that there are two kinds of chancellor: good ones
and popular ones. The first unified budget, due in November, should make
rather clearer what sort of chancellor Mr Clarke will be.
If a responsible chancellor is to be popular, he must be very lucky. Mr
Clarke has had some luck. He inherits an economy that is not only on the
mend, but enjoys low inflation by British standards. Even the Bank of
England accepts that underlying inflation is likely to remain within the
government's target range of 1 to 4 per cent over the next two years.
It is rare for anything in life to come unalloyed and Mr Clarke's luck is no
exception. He also inherited a public sector borrowing requirement estimated
by the Treasury at Pounds 50bn, or 9 per cent of gross domestic product
(excluding privatisation proceeds), for this financial year. Mr Clarke's
parliamentary colleagues tell him in response either that he must not cut
public spending or that he must not raise taxes. Meanwhile, respectable
economists tell him that the fiscal deficit is either mostly cyclical or
that it does not matter very much. He is, in short, being told to hope for
the best. This might seem sensible. It would, in fact, be rash.
Absurd practice
The unified budget brings Mr Clarke several important advantages in his
attempt to deal with the challenge: it allows him to make explicit the
trade-off between spending cuts and tax increases; it should also persuade
even Keynesian economists that the lag between the announcement of measures
and the beginning of the succeeding financial year renders fiscal
fine-tuning unrealistic; most important of all, it can be used to justify a
new level of openness.
To his credit, Mr Clarke has already abandoned the absurd pre-budget
practice of 'purdah'. What has not changed is the secretive way in which tax
changes are decided. The Treasury still insists on its unchallenged control
over economic strategy. Unfortunately, an institution's authority depends on
its performance.
Consent is no longer given unquestioningly to what chancellors propose, even
on the Tory back benches. It has to be earned. If, as seems probable, Mr
Clarke decides on further tax increases, that will prove rather difficult.
What the chancellor needs to do well before the budget therefore is to set
out the situation, the prospects and the options, as the Treasury sees them.
At worst, the opposing factions may then exhaust themselves in internecine
debate. At best, someone may come up with valuable ideas on spending or
taxation that the Treasury has not thought of.
Stable environment
Transparency is the first requirement. It is particularly important when
policy is purely discretionary. Moreover, there is also an excellent chance
of securing long-term growth in the British economy. A second requirement,
therefore, is clarity about the underlying principles for economic policy.
One of those should be provision of a stable macroeconomic environment, with
low inflation not merely secured but actively pursued. Another should be
further rebalancing of monetary and fiscal policy.
For reasons expounded by Mr Lamont's former adviser, Bill Robinson, in his
articles for the FT, further action to reduce the budget deficit will almost
certainly be required. Once that is accepted, it makes no sense to postpone
the adjustment, especially when its adverse macroeconomic effects can always
be offset by monetary easing. Furthermore, the sterling exchange rate, this
month's dissolution of the ERM and the low growth of broad money all suggest
that such easing is already both desirable and justifiable.
This leaves the chancellor the question of how precisely to go about cutting
the deficit. Mr Clarke's desire is to preserve current spending plans, which
means higher taxes. In the long term that is probably the wrong option, but
in the short term there may be little alternative. Either way, choices have
to be made. If he decides to avoid them instead, Mr Clarke is likely to go
down as just another temporarily popular, bad chancellor.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Leading Article: The choice that Russia needs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'YELTSIN HEADS for showdown with Congress,' proclaimed an FT headline just
after Russia's president had won a convincing endorsement in last April's
referendum. Four months on, the showdown is still awaited. Mr Boris Yeltsin
and his parliamentary opponents continue their war of laws, decrees and
corruption charges. His government is paralysed by faction-fighting. Power
and money seep away from the centre to the regions, economic output
declines, and Russians sink further into cynicism about their rulers.
Without a decisive move to break these logjams, the point can not be far off
when political drift turns into serious political danger.
Now President Yeltsin says he is at last about to make such a move: he plans
to outflank congressional diehards by forcing early parliamentary elections
this autumn. Congress will be asked to dissolve itself in order to allow the
creation of a new assembly. If, as seems certain, it refuses, Mr Yeltsin
will press ahead anyway. In one bound, he will be free to govern as
mandated; reform will be back on course; and a new parliament empowered to
join in the creation of a more stable constitutional order.
It would clearly be beneficial, both for Mr Yeltsin and for the cause of
reform, to get rid of a parliament that dates back to communism and which
has consistently passed Soviet-era legislation - most recently a budget that
amounts to a recipe for hyperinflation and a law that attempts to halt
Russia's privatisation programme.
Ample opportunities
But there are several problems with that optimistic scenario. One is that we
have heard it too many times before. In the two years since he led Russia
from the wreckage of the former Soviet Union, Mr Yeltsin has had ample
opportunities either to reform or defeat the parliament, notably immediately
after the dissolution of the USSR. On each occasion, he has ducked, weaved
and temporised, allowing his opponents time to counter-attack.
A second difficulty is posed by the effort to create a new constitution out
of the old. The present constitution is a hopeless mess: it has been amended
so many times by the current parliament as to be unrecognisable, and can now
be used by Mr Yeltsin's opponents to mean almost whatever they want it to
mean. Creating a new one confronted Mr Yeltsin with a near-impossible
dilemma. To get away with violating the law in pursuit of a better one, he
needed to shore up his power base in Moscow and build a coalition of
regional and republican leaders that would support him in his confrontation
with parliament. This he has been trying to do over the past four months -
but at the cost of a devolution of powers to the republics and regions that,
if continued, would call in question the very survival of the Russian
federation. As a result, he is so weakened that his latest manoeuvre seems
more likely to deepen the confusion than to advance democracy.
Policy stalemate
This points to the third, and most important, difficulty for those - like
the Group of Seven - who have pinned their hopes for reform on Mr Yeltsin:
on the evidence of recent months, he seems most unlikely to deliver. It is
now abundantly clear that Russia's policy stalemate is not simply a matter
of president versus parliament, or reformist ministers versus recalcitrant
central bank; it is a paralysis at the heart of the cabinet and presidential
entourage. The cabinet is both divided and incompetent, as shown by the
rouble reform fiasco last month; the reformers who once, briefly, seemed to
act as a government within the government are fighting among themselves; and
Mr Yeltsin seems powerless, or unwilling, to inject greater coherence into
the business of government that goes on in his name.
It is hard to see how a few more months of parliamentary electioneering
alone will resolve that problem. If there are to be elections, they would
more sensibly be for both parliament and president. Such a contest would
give Mr Yeltsin - still held in some esteem around the country - a chance to
spell out what he stands for. If he did so with sufficient vigour and
clarity he would have a good chance of being re-elected. If not, the
alternative would not necessarily be a disaster.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Don't borrow, charge: The chancellor's dilemma, an inside
view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theme of these articles has been that the state of the public finances
is the central economic policy problem facing the government today. It is
simply imprudent for the government to undertake spending which exceeds its
revenues by a fifth. Borrowing Pounds 50bn a year, much of it from
foreigners who may at any point decline to go on lending to us, is a risky
strategy.
The problem has arisen partly because recessions are always bad for the
public finances.
Elections are also bad news, as spending is increased and/or taxes are cut
in the pre-election period. The combination is unusual - governments usually
do their best to prevent elections and recessions from coinciding - and it
has proved lethal.
The unexpected length of the recession, which meant that the election was
repeatedly deferred while waiting for the elusive upturn, subjected the
Treasury to two pre-election public spending rounds.
With the cards thus stacked in favour of spending ministers, public spending
has, after three successive years of 4 per cent real growth, already risen
by more under Mr Major than it did in the entire period in office of Mrs
(now Lady) Thatcher.
The spending spree has coincided with a shortfall of revenue that has been
intensified by the recession. Together these factors have created a
borrowing problem more serious than that of the 1970s, the last time that
the government borrowed on this scale.
Now, as was the case then, new borrowing is causing the stock of debt to
rise rapidly. Then, however, incomes were rising even faster because of
inflation. So the government's debt-to-income ratio, which is the key
variable, actually fell. Today's low rate of inflation means that the large
borrowing requirement is pushing up the government's debt-to-income ratio
extremely quickly.
There is, fortunately, time to deal with the problem. Though the finances
are deteriorating rapidly, they do so from a very favourable starting point.
The government's debt was less than a third of the national income and is
expected to rise to around a half. It can still be stabilised close to the
level that Mrs Thatcher inherited from Labour, though that will require
difficult dec-isions.
The problem is that any way out of the borrowing trap conflicts with other
cherished objectives. Consider what the different options are:
Raise direct taxes? Hardly, because the Conservatives won a closely
contested election by contrasting their own tax cutting record (and promises
of further cuts) with Labour's shadow Budget, which penciled in higher taxes
to pay for more public spending.
Increase indirect taxes? Less difficult politically, since a shift from
direct to indirect taxes has been the thrust of Conservative tax policy
since 1979. But putting up indirect taxes would raise inflation, and the
underlying rate is already uncomfortably close to the government's new
inflation target erected since Britain left the ERM.
Cut public spending? Too late to implement cuts in 1994-95, as the decisions
have already been taken, but cuts in later years must be on the cards.
Confronted with these unpalatable choices it will be very tempting to do
nothing, especially if the recovery improves the public finances. The
do-nothing school will also draw comfort from the Bank of England's success
in funding the deficit. So far the markets have absorbed the massive flow of
new gilt issues without a tremor. Why risk disturbing a fragile recovery in
the interests of reducing a large PSBR that isn't a problem?
The answer to these siren voices is that borrowing is a problem. If it is
not tackled now, it is hard to see when it ever will be. The fact that the
debt is being sold relatively easily is little comfort. It is not hard to
sell debt on a coupon of nearly 8 per cent when headline inflation stands at
1 per cent and the government is aiming to keep underlying inflation in the
lower half of a 1-4 per cent band. The debt sales achieved this year are
better than a funding crisis, but they also constitute a millstone round the
neck of the taxpayer.
The interest charges on Pounds 50bn of debt at 8 per cent come to Pounds 4bn
per annum for the foreseeable future - 2 per cent on the income tax rate,
with all the adverse effects on incentives that entails and no public
spending to show for it. And next year's borrowing will add another 1 1/2
per cent, with more to come in later years.
Mr Clarke will find, like all borrowers that the longer he delays the
correction, the bigger the problem he faces.
The brutal fact is that, with public spending at these levels, the only
choice facing Mr Clarke is between higher taxes now and higher taxes later.
Being an astute politician he may prefer to face up to the problem now, with
the next election still some way off, rather than be forced into unwelcome
action nearer to polling day. He may also reckon that putting up taxes in
the coming Budget will make it politically easier to secure the necessary
reductions in public spending next year.
I say reductions in spending, rather than cuts, because (as I argued in an
earlier article) nobody wants to see lower standards of public provision.
But if borrowing must be reduced and cuts are ruled out, the only
alternative to putting up taxes is to introduce charges. This is a big
political step, but the size of the problem, and the obstacles in the way of
conventional solutions, calls for radical action.
There is no shortage of good ideas.
The government has already moved in the right direction on roads. The
private finance initiative will bring new private funding in to road
building, attracted by the prospect of making a commercial return on capital
in the new world in which road users will pay for the use of premium roads.
The crisis over the provision of university places for all those who achieve
adequate grades would be quickly solved by making students bear some
proportion of the fees, as happens in many other countries.
The quiet revolution in dentistry, where much of the work is now cosmetic
and undertaken privately, points the way to the introduction of charges, for
those who can afford it, for other health services. The 'hotel charge' for
hospital patients is one obvious example.
Mr Clarke has a reputation as a courageous politician, unafraid of tough
decisions.
He has said his instincts are tax-cutting instincts, but he is not
instinctively hostile, as some on the right are, to public spending. As a
man of the 'hard centre', he should seize his opportunity to steer a new
middle course: maintain the standards of public prov-ision but make those
who can afford to pay for it do so.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: FDA should accept performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While welcoming the Treasury's offer to extend performance pay rather
than automatic annual increments to First Division Association (FDA) civil
servants, we were astonished to see the association claiming that actual pay
rises for their members would be 1.25 per cent as increments were
self-financing.
In a recession, when recruitment is reduced and promotion delayed,
incremental salary systems are bound to add a higher than normal percentage
to payroll costs.
It is partly for this reason that our hospital clients are examining
alternatives to the Whitley Council scales, which have resulted in 4 per
cent increases in payroll costs in a year with a 1.5 per cent pay limit.
Only the 1.5 per cent is taken into account when health authorities and
others are negotiating treatment rates, which may help to explain the
financing crisis in so many hospitals.
Although easy to operate, incremental systems have had their day through
their automatic awards for long service but often marginal performance.
I hope the FDA will not only accept the Treasury's offer but champion, more
actively, reward systems that allow the opportunity to earn higher
discretionary rewards.
The recent Top Salaries Review Body Report highlights the increasing and
serious differential between top public and private pay. If automatic
increments were dropped in favour of evaluated performance increases the
nation could probably be much more willing to accept a significant increase
in top civil servants, judges, and, incidentally, MPs' basic pay.

<TEXT>
Sir, May I congratulate David Lascelles on his most objective article on
wind power.
As he indicates, it would take thousands of wind generators to replace one
large power station, and the capital costs involved clearly favour more
traditional generating methods. However, I would point out that the economic
argument against wind generation is even worse than that set out in the
article.
In the UK, the highest levels of electricity demand can arise when there is
a settled high-pressure weather pattern in mid-winter, producing sustained
low temperatures. Such conditions provide little wind at times of greatest
need.
Consequently, wind generation requires backup alternative generating
capacity to avoid a shortfall in supply. The cost of this duplicate capacity
constitutes an additional subsidy to wind generation. It also poses the
question, why does one need two generating systems when one reliable one
will do?

<TEXT>
Sir, David Lascelles is quite right about wind farms. They are
environmentally menacing while making not the slightest sense in energy
terms. Even at the height of the oil crisis in the early 1980s, when I was
energy secretary, I was never shown any evidence that wind power could
become a remotely economic source of electricity.
Why the government should now be approving these intrusive and moaning
monstrosities in some of the most beautiful areas of our country I cannot
understand. Cornwall and mid-Wales have already been scarred. Now there is a
threat to dot these tall structures along the hills either side of the Upper
Wye Valley.
I hope that on both environmental and energy policy grounds the government
will withdraw its encouragement for any more of this desecration and waste.
If we must have huge wind farms at all, they should be sited on the less
attractive parts of our shoreline.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anybody reading David Lascelles' article on wind farms can be in no
doubt about his personal views on the development of wind energy.
Regrettably, he rests his case largely on the basis of erroneous
information.
He claims that the recent decision to allow construction of a wind farm at
Four Burrows in Cornwall is the fourth instance where the environment
secretary has pushed through a wind farm against the wishes of people who
live nearby. This is quite wrong. The other three projects referred to the
secretary of state - Ovenden Moor, Kirby Moor and Cemmaes - were approved by
local planning committees. The government decided that a wider examination
in public should be undertaken.
At Four Burrows the inquiry ensued when the planning committee rejected the
advice of its professional planning officers to grant permission.
The technology is certainly not, as Mr Lascelles argues 'a long way from
commercial operation'. Let us be clear on energy costs. On sites having only
a modest wind speed, the cost of wind-generated electricity over a typical
20-year plant life is about 6.5p per unit, and is coming down. On windier
sites such as are found in parts of Scotland, the price can be substantially
lower. Comparing this, on the same accounting basis, with the prices for
electricity from new conventional power stations, we have coal at about
4.5p/unit, combined cycle gas at 2.6p/unit and nuclear at at least 7p/unit.
As things are at present, wind is not the cheapest. But the costs quoted
here for conventional power projects do not include the external
environmental and social costs that they incur. Evidence presented to the
Commons energy committee last year showed that external costs added about
0.75p/unit for combined cycle gas and 2p/unit for coal and nuclear. Wind,
which requires no fuel to be won or transported, produces no carbon dioxide
or other atmospheric pollution and has no legacy for future generations. It
does not suffer from the associated external costs. It is competitive with
coal and cheaper than nuclear.
Mr Lascelles seeks to belittle the significant contribution that wind energy
can make to our energy needs. The UK has vast wind assets, almost half
Europe's wind resource. This is equivalent to more than double our current
electricity demand. Taking account of its fluctuating nature, siting
constraints, and integrating it into a practical and flexible system it is
reasonable to expect that wind energy could supply 10-20 per cent of our
electricity early in the next century and provide valuable diversity of
supply.
And what of land usage? To generate 10 per cent of our electricity from the
wind would require wind farms extending over 1,200 sq km (not 4,000). This
is only 0.3 per cent of the UK land area and because wind turbines occupy
less than 1 per cent of the area in which they are sited, the actual land
usage would be only 12 sq km. In the other 1,188 sq km, cows could still
safely graze and crops ripen around and below the turbines.
Of course, the main environmental advantage of wind is that it is a clean
energy source. Were the policy, planning and regulatory frameworks to allow
us to achieve the 10 per cent tomorrow, the immedIate benefit would be to
avoid pumping 30m tonnes of carbon dioxide, 30,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide
and 60,000 tonnes of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere each year and without
the long-term safety commitment the nuclear industry has yet to face.
Mr Lascelles might not like wind farms, but the evidence of independent
public opinion surveys shows that less than 10 per cent of the general
public, including those living around wind farms, do not like them. The
substantial majority are in favour.
What they are not is uneconomic or unnecessary.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Wind farms generate storm (1) - David
Lascelles' article on the future of wind energy, published on August 19,
provoked a large number of letters, both for and against the development of
wind power. Here is a selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL GRUBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'An ill wind of change' (August 19), David Lascelles
states that wind energy is 'not a subject of rational discourse'. It is a
pity that one of the FT's finest writers then demonstrates this by raising
five objections to wind power that betray a depressing misunderstanding of
the issues involved.
Two of his five arguments are that the UK has no need for additional
generating capacity and that the existing resource base gives little value
to diversity. Both are true for the next 10-20 years; both are grounds for
not building any additional capacity; both are arguments that have been
consistently rejected by governments and many others in the support of
nuclear power because they are too short term.
On the timescale that it takes to develop substantial capacity of any
non-fossil source, current plant capacity will be outstripped, North Sea oil
and gas production will decline, as will the availability of low-cost UK
coal. And the outlook for imported oil and gas prices at least will become
increasingly volatile.
Mr Lascelles' third argument, that wind's variability is an important
objection, is plain wrong. Variations in wind output cause far fewer
operational problems than the tripping of a single main power generating
set. Like an investment portfolio, what matters is the correlation of a new
input with other variations on the power system.
In fact wind energy is well matched to demand on a seasonable basis and many
technical studies have shown the short-term variability, at the levels being
considered over the next two decades, to be economically irrelevant.
The statement that wind energy is environmentally insignificant because its
contribution will be very small is true for this decade. But in the longer
term, '10 per cent of electricity' is neither small nor an ultimate limit,
and its environmental benefit will be proportionately much larger because it
will displace the dirtiest marginal plant on the system. It could easily
displace 20-40 per cent of power system sulphur dioxide emissions, for
example.
Resource estimates are largely subjective, but obtaining 10 per cent of
electricity from the wind would require wind turbines to be a significant
landscape feature in about 1 per cent of the UK, not allowing for any
possible offshore siting. The acceptability of that is subjective, but
public opinion surveys in areas that have wind farms reveal a large majority
in support.
Which leaves us with the economics. Current wind farms are certainly more
costly than power from new gas stations at current prices, or existing coal
stations.
But with the costs falling steadily as this nascent industry becomes a big
business, it is likely to be competitive if gas prices rise and against new
coal or nuclear stations.
The central point is that new energy industries cannot be created overnight.
The government has created a system of phased supports to reflect indirect
costs of conventional production and to help the early stages of an industry
that is likely to be an important component of sustainable energy supplies.
As part of a major project on renewable energy strategies, I at least have
been led to the conclusion that it is a remarkably rational and valuable
policy.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Companies still weighed down by
burden of tax regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM BACCHUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to your article on deregulation and the Department of Trade
and Industry ('Heseltine's crusade progresses in silence', August 20), Tim
Sainsbury, UK industry minister, believes the message of deregulation has
been 'received and understood' and co-operation with other departments is
'getting better'.
The members of the London Society of Chartered Accountants would beg to
differ. From the perspective of our clients, while the government looks at a
large number of petty regulations, it is failing miserably to tackle the
largest burdens of them all - the tax and accounting regulations.
The Manchester Business School in 1991 estimated that an average business
spent 20 per cent of its pre-tax profits dealing with company and tax
regulations. This percentage would have been higher for smaller businesses
which make up the majority of British industry. Since then, of course, the
recession has turned many profits into losses but the red tape has not
stopped rolling.
The recently approved Finance Act, for example, was the second longest ever
at 300 pages. It introduced no fundamental changes but dealt with so many
issues in such technicality that all but the largest companies will be
forced to turn to their tax advisers for more help. Many companies will be
required to change their accounting or tax software to cope, and almost all
companies will find the time they spend on tax administration increasing
still further. Pay-and-file, another recent piece of tax legislation, is
also adding heavily to that administrative effort.
Before we are convinced that the message of deregulation has been received,
let us see some positive co-operation between the Treasury (with the various
tax authorities) and the DTI. Let us see all legislation evaluated for its
cost/benefits and a massive reduction in the tax and accounting trivia
inflicted on us.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Raise status of vocational training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr D P SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed by Mr J E Troth
regarding the stigma of the work-based vocational route for 16-year-olds
('Training on job needs better image', August 18), I would suggest that
there are two main obstacles to progress.
The first is the absurdity in which schools get a full year's money for each
pupil entering sixth form, even if the pupil leaves after a few weeks; the
second, a careers service that is both under-resourced and falls under the
quasi-political control of the local education authorities which still
control most schools.
One solution would be to make the careers service independent and give each
16-year-old a training credit (as advocated by the Confederation of British
Industry), which could be used to pay for training at school, college or via
youth training with an employer who offers a full-time job from day one.
Payment would be made only on the achievement of results.
Real progress towards giving 16-years-olds a genuine choice will be made
only when we have a combined department of education and training that puts
equal value on all post-16 education and training.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Sackman's 'Hawthorn' - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Sackman, the 43-year-old English composer, had this year his first
commission for the BBC Proms. The result - a 25-minute piece for large
orchestra entitled Hawthorn - was revealed in the Albert Hall last Thursday,
in a concert by the BBC Symphony under Andrew Davis, and will surely have
proved immensely gratifying to all concerned. Sackman's output is not large
(Hawthorn is only his second orchestral encounter); he works out his
material with spare, unwasteful concentration; his concerns are not at all
those of current fashion (ie minimalist note-spinning of the Holy-Mystic or
the Neo-Brutalist persuasions).
Hawthorn is an example of Sackman's tautly contained musical argument, yet
it manifests an intensity gradually but ineluctably built up, a cumulative
power that I have not experienced in his music before. This may have been
the 'release' provided by a large orchestra, or by the novel (Glyn Hughes's
The Hawthorn Goddess) which supplied the work's initial inspiration.
Whatever the cause, the music - in a continuous three-part (fast-slow-fast)
structure - states its terms with remarkable confidence in their potential,
and a control of their dramatic unfolding that kept me intent on the
progress of every note. Those terms, described in wildly oversimplified
fashion, might be said to be the central opposition of crabbed, jabbing,
harmonically complex chordal chunks, rhythmically charged in their
groupings, against lyrical lines growing ever freer and lengthier. In the
finale, after the ruminatively spacious slow movement has run its course,
the argument snowballs to its expansively lyrical coda with an
exhilaratingly unstoppable energy which one senses had been honestly earned.
The orchestral colouring is comparably rigorous, with no element of
artificial ear-catching, yet similarly strong - punchily athletic brass,
airily striding strings, everywhere a 'personal' command of timbre and
texture. If (as Sackman suggested in a laconic programme note) Hawthorn is
indeed something of a dry run for a possible opera based on the same
material, I hope our opera administrators are already battling it out for
the honour of realising that possibility.
Under Davis, always a sympathetic, precisely commanding interpreter of
complex new works, the BBC Symphony gave the impression of relishing
Sackman's rugged contrasts - rather more so, indeed, than earlier they had
the glitter of Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto. But though the
accompaniment may have been bland, the solo part was delivered with a
sensational blend of virtuosity, sophistication and purring sweetness: Maxim
Vengerov, 19 years old, was making his proms debut, in a way to cap even the
most noteworthy of his previous London appearances.
Another of Davis's special gifts is 20th-century English music of an older
and, on the face of it, less challenging character, to which he brings such
sweeping conviction that every ounce of original freshness is recovered. On
Sunday, with the BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, he revealed this gift
anew. Delius's Sea Drift had Thomas Allen as a mature, affecting baritone
soloist; John Ireland's Piano Concerto showed Kathryn Stott in sparkling
form; in Elgar's The Music Makers Jean Rigby's rich-hued mezzo was at once
powerfully emotional and tenderly reticent. All three works are Proms
warhorses, yet Davis allowed no hint of laxity or routine to spoil their
latest appearance there.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Mark Morris, three of the best - Anthony Macaulay
wonders how the same man can make three pieces so unalike / The Edinburgh
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The audience cheers Mark Morris's second Edinburgh programme even more than
the first - as do I. It includes three pieces all new to Britain: the JS
Bach Jesu, meine Freude (good), the Michelle Shocked-Rob Wasserman Home
(better), and the Lou Harrison (best). As in Programme One, the live music
is so excellent you could shut your eyes all evening and have a great time.
But I imagine that most people, while leaving the Meadowbank Stadium at the
evening's close, must feel mighty bewildered - as do I. Who is Mark Morris?
How in the world can the same man make three pieces so unalike?
As everyone must know by now, Morris makes homosexual dance look as natural
as hetero-; and in this respect he is a breakthrough choreographer. But
Jesu, meine Freude shows another breakthrough side of him, lesser-known:
that he means dance to express religious as well as secular conditions. It
is very odd to see a dance set without irony to a Bach devotional cantata.
Odd, because for over 16 centuries Christianity has been the religion most
determined to divide flesh from spirit, and to make dance an irreligious and
profane art. But here are 10 of Morris's dancers - dancers of various races,
dancers with more flesh than you see in ballet, dancers linked in various
AC/DC couplings  - rapt in religious devotion.
As a dance, Jesu meine Freude is bright with internal variety. Passages of
severe upper-body gestures (reflecting the rigours of religious
contemplation) are opposed to sequences of fluent, travelling dance
(suggesting the lyric transports of religious rapture). The former keep
leading to, are the premise of, the latter; and both grow naturally out of
the music. I do, however, detect a certain absence of spontaneity, a slight
nearer-my-God-to-thee self-conscious holiness, in the movement style that
keeps me from surrendering to this dance's spirit.
Home, by contrast, is a powerful and poetic piece of secular Americana. Set
to music composed and performed by Michelle Shocked and Rob Wasserman, it
consists of six sections. Numbers 2, 4 and 6 are country music, communal
dances, bright-spirited affairs, in which men and women 'clog' in leather
shoes. Numbers 1, 3 and 5, however, are scenes for women without men, dark
and bleak scenes of women in the agricultural mid-West, while Shocked sings
with thrilling force of (no. 1, 'I Need a Friend') loneliness, (no. 3,
'Still-born') depression, and (no. 5, 'Winter Wheat') impatience. As Home
alternate between these two tones, it grows ever more moving: harsh and
compassionate at the same time.
The evening ends with an extraordinary work, an utter knockout work, Grand
Duo, a four-part dance for full company. (Its final section, Polka, was seen
here last year; the rest is new.) The music is by Lou Harrison (b1917), an
American composer whose music Morris has used before; what music of his I
have heard strikes me as so superb that I am amazed how seldom it is played
here. This Grand Duo for Violin and Piano, though composed only five years
ago, is vintage modernism: driving, fragmented, with elements of folk music
thrown into its furious engines.
The tribal dance that Morris has made to this music is like the Rite of
Spring you always wanted to see and never have. It is, at one and the same
time, (a) a brilliant piece of primitivism, a pulsing vision of an archaic
community, (b) a shocking portrait of neurological disturbance, an assembly
of people seldom touching but united in violent and helpless gestures that
need to be exorcised, their alarmingly frenetic energies emerging from deep
within, (c) a work that shows people like cogs in a vast impersonal device,
driven by machine rhythms.
Grand Duo is the most thrilling new dance I have seen for many a long month.
It is, I believe, the greatest thing that Morris has made since the 1989
Dido and Aeneas; and, like that and other works of his, a masterpiece. Every
praise to the dancers, who are the committed embodiment of Morris's grand
design. Because of them, liking his dances is the easiest thing in the
world. They make you fall in love again with dancing, dancing to music,
dancing as instinct and life force.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Scottish Variety - the Fabulous Fifties / The
Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Edinburgh Festival is resolutely elitist this year (nothing wrong with
that, of course.) But it did throw up its skirts once - for performances of
Scottish Variety - the Fabulous Fifties.
This was a recreation of the last days of the music hall, when all the
Grands and Empires throughout the land still presented weekly variety bills
consisting of rough comedians and twee sopranos, drag acts and dog acts. But
the show at the King's Theatre was hardly a recreation. The theatre has
changed little in 40 years. There is the red plush curtain; the brightly
painted backdrops; the illuminated number board at the side to identify the
acts; and, bless 'em, many of the old performers, Jimmy Logan, the Tiller
Girls, and yes, even Susan Maughan, still hoofing it.
Time really was frozen. 'Mr Happiness', Johnny Beattie, told jokes about
seaside landladies and those idiots from Glasgow with impeccable timing; the
Tiller Girls jack-knifed across the stage, smiles superglued; there was even
another chance for that extinct art form, the Scottish sketch, with a
Rangers fan converting to Celtic on his death bed so that the auld enemy
would have one less supporter.
Of course you were reminded how awful much of it was - the 1950s must have
been the worst decade for music this century - and some acts survived on
routines that would make Bob Monkhouse blush. But it was clean and jolly and
it really was variety. So what if the trampoliners muffed their climax; who
cares if a Tiller tumbles; and tough luck that Susan Maughan is no longer
'Bobby's Girl'. The entertainers of the 1950s were at one with their
audience and any snarling, expletive-ridden alternative comedian would have
been silenced at last by this display of genuine folk art. He might even
have risen and joined in the National Anthem at the end.

There is, it seems, nothing the BBC will not now do to disguise the fact
that they are showing yet more repeats. BBC2 screens the first of three
profiles of famous modern architects, Master Builders, billing them as a
'New Series'. In fact they are repeats of items already shown on 'The Late
Show'. Today's subject is Philip Johnson, 86, who was once more than a
little sympathetic to Nazism (7.45).
Since the enthusiasm for demonising one faction in the Bosnian civil war
seems highly dubious to me, I shall be interested to see Joan Philips'
programme in C4's Free For All (8.00). We are told that the BBC's Martin
Bell is among those who support her assertion that journalists have not
given enough attention to covering all sides.
The third of BBC2's series about the Mongol hordes, Storm From The East,
finds a monk, Friar John of Plano Carpini, being sent out to eastern Asia to
investigate 'the devil's horsemen' and arriving in time to witness the
enthronement of The Great Khan (9.45). BBC2 also offers a 'Late Show'
special on The Art Of St Ives.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Past echoes of reality - William Packer catches the
Gilman collection of photography / The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Waking Dream is the one serious exhibition of visual art, of any sort,
that this year the Edinburgh Festival acknowledges as part of itself. No
matter that it comes fully fledged from the nest of the Metropolitan Museum
of New York, and flies on to the Hermitage at St Petersburg for the winter:
the Festival's engagement with the visual arts was ever thus - indifferent,
opportunistic, conscience-free. And we, for our part, should simply be
grateful that so many remarkable and wonderful images have been brought over
for our delight.
The collection is the creature of Howard Gilman, present chairman of the
paper company founded by his grandfather, who has concentrated his interest
on photography's first 100 years, that is to say from the moment of its
first practical demonstration by William Fox Talbot in the late 1830s up to
the eve of the second world war. As a period it would seem to fit well
enough, a nice round number that embraces all the principal technical
developments, notably the progressive miniaturisation of the equipment and
the ever-increasing ease and flexibility of its handling.
But perhaps such scope was, in the event, something of a snare and a
delusion. The heart and substance of the show, and of the splendid
book-cum-catalogue that goes with it, lie rather with the work of the first
60 or 70 years and its story of early experimentation, rapid maturity and
sophistication and at last the conscious expressive potential achieved by
the turn of the century. The 20th century is simply too rich a subject to
warrant the afterthought allowed it here. Had the show ended at the first
rather than the second war, the point would have been better made.
The point, to be fair, is half-acknowledged in the title of the show, which
is taken from Keats's 'Ode to a nightingale' and worth the full quotation:
'Was it a vision, or a waking dream?/ Fled is that music: - do I wake or
sleep?' To catch the fleeting image on the wing, as picking notes out of the
air, had always seemed quite beyond human reach. The note was played and was
gone even as it was heard: and the thing seen? That too was gone or was
changed even as it was seen, to be recalled only in its simulacrum.
The excitement at seeing those first shadowy, ghost-like echoes of reality
appearing on the page may only be imagined, but it was real enough. Even now
we may catch something of it, if only the faintest hint, not as excitement
at all but in the poignant frisson of recognition we feel as we look again
at those gentlemen, so studiedly negligent in their stovepipe hats, those
women sitting in dappled sunshine on the lawn, that broom still leaning
against the door.
It is the nicest irony that photography should have suffered ever since by
the expectation raised at its very invention, that here was a mirror held up
to nature. It was never, could never be, any such thing. The double-irony is
that whenever it aspires, therefore, to the condition of art, its inherent
and apparent realism is held against it, with affectation and
self-indulgence summoned in aid. The truth of it is simple enough. Any fool
can use a camera, or a pencil or brush for that matter. The camera is a tool
available to the artist, with its peculiar virtues, limitations and
disciplines to master and exploit. It is not its picking-up that makes him
so but only the use he makes of it.
What makes so many of these early images so potent in their effect upon the
imagination is that whatever else they might have been thinking of, the
photographers were primarily engrossed in the mastery of their medium. There
is to their work a quality of definition and deliberation that can only be a
function of the equipment to hand, and the opportunities it afforded. With
everything ready and the pose set, even the landscape seems to hold its
breath. Does it matter whether Lady Hawarden, using her daughters and nieces
as her models at home in South Kensington, or Horatio Ross out stalking on
his Scottish estates, thought of themselves as artists or mere amateur
technicians? The images they produced are manifest works of art.
The much smaller exhibition, Photographing Children, hung low on the wall
for the benefit of its young audience, contrives to ask many of the same
questions of the photographers' attitudes and intentions. Its subject is the
child, as photographed from the Edinburgh urchins of Hill and Adamson in the
1840s, through the conventional studio portraiture of the later Victorians
to Roger Mayne's Gorbals urchins of the 1940s and so on to the documentary
and reportage, of such as Iain Stewart, Francine Dunkley, Owen Logan and
John Charity, of today.
The work throughout is wonderfully appealing, and yet it is a curious
paradox that for all the technical advantages and freedoms enjoyed by the
modern practitioners, their material seems less definitive and universal in
its imagery, and more incidental, narrative and sentimental. Is it that just
another exposure is, well, just another exposure? Is it that the taking of
the photograph is now so easy that all effort and consideration is directed
at the mis-en-scene? Or are we simply too close to them to say? Perhaps we
are. And perhaps this present glossy professionalism in time will take on
the qualities we find even in the vintage prints of the 1950s.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Good faith at risk - Lloyd's case
reveals a lacuna in English law, according to A H Hermann
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dispute between Mrs Patricia Ashmore and other Lloyd's Names and the
Corporation of Lloyd's, will be heard by the Court of Appeal in February
next year.
It has been before the courts since 1988. After much effort and money was
spent on the full trial, the Corporation asked that the preliminary issues
of law be tried first, thus avoiding publicity for the underlying facts. The
plaintiffs' objections were overruled by the Law Lords.
Deciding the issues of law a year ago, Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled the
Corporation has no duty of care towards its members and has immunity from
damages.
The final decision will affect the readiness of Names to underwrite risks
and the City's reputation as a place where contracts are performed in good
faith.
English law is different in that it does not include a generalised concept
of good faith and fair dealing. To achieve the same effect judges developed
a variety of devices. Thus for 200 years the courts of equity have refused
to enforce contracts which no sane, honest or fair-minded person would
accept, calling such contracts 'unconscionable'.
Trustees, and directors of companies, are bound by a fiduciary duty, while a
duty of care, not to cause harm to their employers and inform them of
potential dangers, is implied by law in such contracts as are daily
concluded by agents or builders.
One would assume that these rules, without which business could hardly
exist, bear on the relationship between Names and the Corporation; and that
they are reinforced by special Lloyd's Acts between 1871-1982.
But this was not the judge's view. He rejected the plaintiffs' claim that
the Corporation had a duty of care to protect them against misbehaving or
dishonest agents managing Lloyd's syndicates, and to inform them in time of
misbehaviour so they could avoid losses.
The judge also accepted the extensive interpretation of the immunity from
damages granted to the Corporation by the 1982 Lloyd's Act in respect of
their statutory duties. He ruled that it also encompasses breach of
contractual duties about which the Act is silent.
The Court of Appeal will be asked to say what are the implied contents of
the contract concluded between a Name and the Corporation.
By such contracts Names allow agents managing Lloyd's syndicates to
underwrite in their name risks for which Names then bear unlimited
liability. They must not interfere with the business of the agents, who are
not members of the Corporation, but who are admitted and supervised by the
Corporation and report their dealings to it.
As it is a duty of a contractual agent to obey his principal's instructions,
it would appear managing agents are organs of the Corporation and it is the
Corporation which is the agent of Names.
This argument, which the plaintiffs seem to have overlooked, is reinforced
by the fact that all premiums are collected by brokers admitted and
supervised by the Corporation, and who also acted as managing agents of
syndicates until 1987 when this conflict of interests was removed.
The contract leaves Names two safeguards: an individually agreed limit on
total premiums, which limits the risk that may be underwritten in their
name; or the statutory assurance that the object of the Corporation is to
protect and further Names' interests and keep them informed.
Only the Corporation knows, or can take steps to know, whether the premium
limit has been exhausted, and it seems to be its contractual duty to stop
the limit being overstepped. When inviting a prospective name to sign the
contract, the Corporation gives him documents claiming that it controls the
admission and operation of brokers and managing agents.
He who claims influence and power in making a contract should exercise it in
performing it. Or, as Sir Henry Fisher, the judge, wrote in his 1980 report,
the Names 'can reasonably look to the committee (now the Council) for
protection'.
The Corporation's duty to respect the premium limits and inform Names of any
doubt about the skill and honesty of the agents must be on the mind of the
parties when signing the contract as 'a matter of course' - a test of
implied duty.
The other test, that such implication is also necessary, is obvious: no
person in his right mind would put in another's hands not only his fortune
but also the power to bankrupt him by undertaking in his name risks without
limit; nor would he forgo the right to be informed about mismanagement or
dishonesty by those underwriting risks in his name.
If the higher courts decide that the Corporation has such a duty of care
towards Names, the case will return to the High Court for trial.
To succeed, the plaintiffs will have to prove the Corporation failed to
protect them against exposure to risks substantially exceeding the agreed
premium limit and that the Council did not even inform them of the
conclusions of the Chester Committee of Enquiry. This alleged certain
underwriters and brokers were claiming they kept business within the agreed
limits when they were exceeding them.
The plaintiffs add that the Council allowed the agents to continue to
operate on behalf of the Names though it found the Chester report's
allegations serious enough to stop new Names joining the criticised
syndicates.
The Corporation has made a number of reforms and is seeking corporate
investors to underwrite insurance. The latter are likely to press for better
internal controls. Yet the outcome of the appeal remains of great
significance.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Competition supremo - Robert Rice
speaks to Graeme Odgers, head of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Publication last week of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's
long-awaited reports on British Gas shot Mr Graeme Odgers into the public
limelight for the first time in his new role as MMC chairman.
Although Mr Odgers arrived at the MMC too late to be closely involved with
the report, the generally favourable reaction to the commission's findings
has ensured a good start for the Odgers' era.
However, it is too early to judge whether the appointment of Mr Odger, an
experienced industrialist, will translate into an overall change in approach
to competition policy.
Mr Odgers' appointment by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, last December, was generally seen by observers as another step
towards a new approach to competition issues.
When Mr Heseltine took over at the DTI, he promised a pro-industrial policy,
intervening to help British companies 'before breakfast, before lunch,
before tea and before dinner'. As an industrialist and the first non-lawyer
to head the Commission, Mr Odgers was seen as Mr Heseltine's man.
Mr Odgers' industrial credentials made him an ideal candidate for the task
of bringing a more pro-industry focus to the work of the commission.
At Tarmac, he revived the construction company, increasing turnover from
Pounds 85m to Pounds 1.6bn during his seven-year spell. He moved onto
British Telecom, first as deputy chairman and chief financial officer and
then as group managing director under the chairmanship of Mr Iain Vallance.
It was a very difficult time (at BT), says Mr Odgers. The telecommunications
group was experiencing widespread problems and after 'struggling manfully'
with these for four years, he left suddenly in early 1990, returning to the
construction industry as head of Alfred McAlpine.
Mr Odgers put his abrupt departure from BT down to 'a clash of management
styles' with Mr Vallance. One-on-one relationships are always difficult, he
explains, unless there is real understanding and a coincidence of style.
'Perhaps I was too inflexible in some ways in my commitment to
decentralisation and in my views about how a business should run to make the
relationship work.'
Mr Odgers' public sector experience is also thought to have impressed Mr
Heseltine. In the early 1970s he spent three years as head of the DTI's
industrial development unit.
Peter Walker was then trade and industry secretary. But by the time Mr
Odgers had taken up his appointment, there had been a change of government
and he found himself working for Labour's Tony Benn.
The Conservatives saw the IDU as a vehicle for handling regional aid under
the Industry Act; but under Mr Benn its role widened and Mr Odgers found
himself heading the investigation and negotiation of support deals for lame
duck companies such as motor manufacturer British Leyland.
'Heading the IDU in the middle of an industrial crisis and trying to
reconcile the political aspirations of one's masters with the industrial and
commercial realities of the marketplace was what I call a challenging job,'
he says.
He found the experience 'riveting'; so much so that when the opportunity of
returning to the public sector presented itself - as as head of the MMC - he
had little hesitation in accepting.
The only hole on his curriculum vitae as far as the MMC job was concerned
was the lack of a legal qualification. At the time of his appointment, this
lacuna was seen by many as an advantage: Mr Odgers was viewed as a hands-on
industrialist prepared to inject some much-needed pragmatism into the
legalistic procedures which surround UK competition policy.
Three and a half months into the job, Mr Odgers is not so sure. The
commission operates within a legal framework, he says; failure to observe
the law would result in its decisions being challenged in court. Mr Odgers
has therefore been put through a series of tutorials with the Commission's
lawyers, which he describes as 'rewarding, but hard work'.
So is he Mr Heseltine's man? 'Obviously, given my background, there was no
way I was going to approach the job from a legalistic point of view. When
looking at the public interest criteria I'm bound to put full weight behind
the industrial and commercial considerations.'
He is, nevertheless, a firm believer in the importance of competition. 'If
you don't have a sound competition environment you're not going to have
sound competitive industries.'
'But,' he adds, 'competitiveness - the ability to compete in whatever is the
relevant market - is also hugely important.'
Does this mean that the enforcement of competition policy must be flexible -
that it is pointless having strong competition in local markets if it
prevents companies competing on the world stage?
'What I'm saying is that you have to identify what the relevant marketplace
is in each case. What you don't want is, in stimulating competition within
local and domestic markets, to stop your relevant industry competing in what
turns out to be the real marketplace, which may be the European or an
interna-tional marketplace.
'Sometimes these conflicts occur and one has to take it into account, no
question about it.
'Having said that,' he adds, 'the best stimulus to the creation of strong
international competition is a strong competitive framework within your own
domestic marketplace. If you don't have it, you'll have soft industry.'
Mr Odgers is happiest talking about competition and its relationship to
competitiveness. He is less forthright on other issues such as reform of
competition law, relations with the European Commission and the structure of
the UK competition authorities.
He has yet to meet Mr Karel van Miert, EC competition commissioner, but
foresees no problems in reaching common ground on a variety of competition
issues with his EC counterpart.
Nor does Mr Odgers see the need for radical change to the UK law on the
abuse of monopoly power - a view shared by his predecessor, Sir Sydney
Lipworth. And he is cautious about any change in the relationship between
the MMC and the Office of Fair Trading; he welcomes the recently announced
government review of the OFT.
As an industrialist Mr Odgers is aware of industry complaints about the
duplication of effort between the OFT and the MMC and the administrative
burdens this places on parties involved in investigations. Mr Odgers would
like to streamline and speed-up procedures, but maintains that, if the MMC
is to do its job properly, then there are inevitably going to be burdens on
industry. The process is, he says, 'a balancing act'.
Like his predecessor, Mr Odgers would welcome the appointment of more
hands-on industrialists to the MMC but recognises the difficulties many
prospective candidates would face in devoting sufficient time to the
commission.
Barely 100 days into the job, has he changed his views in any way since
arriving?
He says he had not appreciated the full extent of the difficulties of
competition policy. There are all sorts of internal dilemmas and
inconsistencies which make any MMC judgment 'so much more difficult than I
had originally thought'.

FT  24 AUG 93 / People: Peter Allen retires early
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Allen, the deputy chairman of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has
announced his intention to retire from the firm in April next year when he
will be 56.
His departure follows the decision by Brandon Gough, chairman of Coopers for
the past ten years, to step down when his current term finishes in April
1994.
These moves clear the way for elections from among the partners for a new
chairman, who will be able to select a fresh management team. The vote takes
place in November.
Coopers says that Allen had told his partners earlier this year that he
would be retiring and that he intends to take on a number of non-executive
appointments.
He joined the firm in 1963 from university, became a partner in 1973 and
partner in charge of the London office in 1983 before becoming managing
partner in 1984.
He led a team that nego-tiated the merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells in
1990 and after that became deputy chairman with responsibility for
overseeing UK activities and acting as chairman of the management
consultancy practice across Europe.

FT  24 AUG 93 / People: Brown to take on Rechem's problems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, has hired Colin Brown from
Exxon Chemical as the new operations director of the environmental services
division.
Since he lives in the New Forest, Brown will be not too far distant from the
incineration plant at Fawley, one of five sites around the country for which
he will be responsible and which was last year fined for discharging arsenic
into Southampton Water.
He also has the advantage of having worked in what Shanks &amp; McEwan calls 'a
very closely allied industry'. 'They (Exxon) make the stuff and we destroy
it,' a company spokesman explains.
Both companies are also favourite targets of the green lobby - Exxon will
long be associated with the Valdez disaster, while Rechem, acquired by
Shanks &amp; McEwan in 1991, has been under fire particularly at Pontypool,
where it destroys toxic waste such as PCBs and dioxins.
Brown's appointment is not directly related to the Pollution Inspectorate's
recent warning, in the course of its licence renewal, that Pontypool should
improve the monitoring of its toxic emissions, according to Shanks. Instead,
David Wheeler, the previous managing director of Shanks &amp; McEwan
(Environmental Services), which incorporates Rechem and the technical
services division of Shanks, had felt he himself had enough operational
experience, but his recently appointed successor, Mike Averill, wished to
reintroduce the post.
Brown, 38, a chemical engineering graduate from Bath, who joined Exxon 16
years ago, will be in charge of Fawley and Pontypool, the high temperature

Scientists at International Business Machines' Adstar data storage division
in San Jose, California, have achieved a breakthrough that is expected to
increase the amount of data that can be stored on a computer disc drive by a
factor of about 30 by the end of the decade.
The Adstar scientists predict their new method of producing a phenomenon
called 'giant magneto-resistance' will make it possible to store up to 10bn
bits of information per square inch of the surface of a computer disc. This
is roughly equivalent to storing all of the text of 10,000 300-page novels
on a double-sided, 3.5inch hard disc drive.
Magneto-resistance is a change in the electrical resistance of a material
when it is in the presence of a magnetic field.
IBM has pioneered the use of this phenomenon in data storage systems. Data
is stored on computer disc in the form of minute magnetised spots. When a
magneto-resistive sensor or 'head' skims over the surface of the rotating
disc it passes through the tiny magnetic fields produced by these dots and
its electrical resistance is changed, producing a signal that 'reads' the
bits of data stored on the disc.
However, as the density of data stored on computer discs increases, the
magnetic spots become smaller and smaller and it becomes more difficult to
detect their magnetic fields.
The giant magneto-resistive effect represents a potential solution to this
problem. It produces an electrical signal more than five times stronger than
that produced by heads based on conventional magneto-resistive technology.
Until now, laboratory demonstrations of giant magneto-resistance have
required exotic materials, very low temperatures, or complex processes.
However, the IBM researchers have designed a giant magneto-resistive sensor
that is relatively simple to make. It is based upon a stack of very thin
layers of magnetic (nickel-iron alloy) and non-magnetic (silver) materials.
Fabricated using standard semiconductor production techniques each layer of
material is only about two billionths of a meter thick.
The structure is then annealed in a furnace to align the magnetic poles of
adjacent layers in opposite directions. When the structure is placed in a
magnetic field, all of the magnetic layers align in the same direction,
producing a 'giant' signal.
Adstar now plans to move the technology into its development laboratories,
to make prototype disc drive heads capable of reading data stored on a disc.
The next step will be to optimise the materials and processes for mass
production. The technology is expected to appear in products in about three
years.
'There should be no fundamental problems in transferring the technology from
the laboratory to manufacturing,' says Kevin Coffey, one of the group of
Adstar scientists that has worked on the project.
IBM has patent applications pending on the structure and the process for
producing its giant magneto-resistive sensors.
An unusual aspect of the giant magneto-resisitive sensor development is that
it was conducted within the IBM product group, rather than at the company's
research laboratories.
The research was conducted as part of an 'IBM Fellow' programme, under the
leadership of Kent Howard, one of IBM's leading scientists who was made an
IBM Fellow three years ago. The programme gives IBM's top scientists great
latitude to pursue their research interests and work directly with product
groups.
For computer users, the development promises higher density and lower cost
data storage. This is becoming increasingly important with the advent of
multi-media computing requiring storage of large quantities of data
including video, voice and graphics as well as text.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Technology: Price pressure - Upgrading a PC is possible but
can cost as much, if not more, than a new model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The age of the disposable personal computer is here. In spite of the growing
number of manufacturers producing 'green' PCs, the sad fact is that most
systems are built to be thrown away and, in the short term, little is being
done to change that.
It all comes down to economics. In the world of PCs, new technologies are
being introduced and adopted so quickly that it is rarely worth upgrading an
older computer.
For anyone who does not want a disposable PC, there are theoretically a
number of technologies that could make life easier. However, there is no
guarantee as yet that they will work. One solution is the idea of the
upgradeable computer processor. It has been used by various PC manufacturers
over the years in building so-called 'future-proof' PCs.
There is no better illustration of the pitfalls of this approach, though,
than the recent array of 'Pentium-upgradeable' systems. Pentium is Intel's
latest computer processor. Pentium-upgradeable systems were supposed to
allow users to remove the moderately powerful Intel 486 processors and
replace them with the Pentium processors, as these became available to
users, in order to achieve the much higher performance.
Unfortunately, when the Pentium processor was installed on the 486s,
over-heating problems occurred. In addition, memory and storage capacity
were not always installed in the most appropriate configuration for
Pentium-based systems.
Owing to such problems, even the properly-executed Pentium upgrade often
ended up costing as much as buying a brand new Pentium system - and it still
did not deliver the same levels of performance as an off-the-shelf model.
If upgrading PCs were just a matter of solving the problematic processor
installations, however, an appropriate method could eventually be found. The
complicating factor in the process is the fast pace of change in the
complementary technologies - especially in video display, memory and in data
storage areas.
The performance of personal computer video in particular has improved
dramatically in the past few years.
In most IBM-compatible PCs, video output is generated through the use of a
display adaptor expansion card that sits in one of the PC's 'expansion
slots', but these adaptor cards run at a rate of only 8 Megahertz. While 8
MHz speed was fine in 1984, today's fastest PC processors can run at between
40 and 66 MHz - with 100 MHz 486 processors not far off.
A variety of solutions to meet the video and memory requirements have been
put forward including video accelerators, faster processors on the video
display adaptors - as well as more memory. Whatever changes are made to the
video card, however, it still has to communicate with the motherboard of the
PC at only 8 MHz.
And this is where 'local bus' video comes in. This is a way for the video
circuitry to talk 'directly' to the processor over a 'local bus' - rather
than the standard AT expansion bus (data channel).
This means that a local bus video system has to be built on to the
motherboard of the computer in a proprietary fashion - at least until some
form of local bus video standard evolves. There are 32-bit expansion slots
in existence, but none will yet operate at the speeds that can be achieved
by hanging a local bus directly off the processor.
Local bus video systems claim to be able to run at between 33 to 50 MHz.
And with today's Microsoft Windows applications demanding that amount of
additional performance, it is clearly a technology that will be increasingly
in demand over the coming years.
There have also been significant improvements in increasing PC memory
capacity - either random access memory (Ram) or magnetic storage. Again,
this would enable Windows applications to be loaded on to a system which
originally had too little memory capacity to run such software.
Although technology advances make PC upgrades possible, they are still
problematic. So if you want a better PC than the one you already own the
most simple answer may be to buy a new one. The real challenge will be to
find a home for the old computer.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Technology: Conflict in the computer market - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL PASSMORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORD 'proprietary' to the computer market these days elicits much the
same response as 'cold war' does to the world at large. If the battle has
not been won, then at least it has gone away. We now live in an open world.
Unfortunately, it is not true, and it would be dangerously complacent to
think otherwise. The cold war is not over, only the players and territory
have changed.
Open systems mean that users are not tied in to any hardware or software
that will limit their future room for manoeuvre. They can select what is
best for their needs, rather than what their supplier chooses to give them.
The traditional enemy of open systems was the hardware supplier. Mainframe
and supermini suppliers provided computers with unique operating systems. If
you built your company's computer strategy on such a platform, you were
stuck with it.
However today, open systems users can rejoice in the knowledge that they
have in the Unix operating system a stable software platform on which to
build and a range of hardware from which to choose. All of the leading Unix
vendors - including some of its erstwhile enemies - are now party to the
Common Open Software Environment, or Cose, which aims to bring further
commonality to the Unix world in such important areas as screen windowing.
This is good news for the user, but it is not being done entirely for the
sake of standardisation. It is also being done because Cose members see the
threat to openness of the dominance of a new proprietary enemy - Microsoft.
The software company has given the PC user an operating system and a range
of tools and applications that dominate their markets.
Microsoft's more recent product offerings - its larger applications and, in
particular, the Windows NT operating environment - are set to take it into
the multi-user, multi-tasking domain - the province of the Unix vendor.
There is an uneasy alliance between the two sides of Microsoft's business -
operating and applications software - which has given rise to anti-trust
investigations at the US justice department. Rival applications vendors
contend that Microsoft's ownership of Windows gives it an unfair
time-to-market advantage.
It is in no one's interests that the balance of power should tip towards one
company. Such a shift limits a customer's ability to choose, leading to less
competition and less innovation.
There are already similar danger signs in the Unix-led market that Microsoft
is now attacking. There is much at stake with Windows NT, Microsoft's Unix
competitor, and Microsoft has said that it may alter the source code - the
heart of the software - to prevent other companies from running applications
in an NT-like environment.
What is more, despite claims to the contrary, NT is currently not based on
recognised standards. (It has, for example, no X/Open recognition - the
universally recognised mark of a standards-based open system.) If Microsoft
continues to ignore this issue there will be a return to the days when users
were beholden to the dictates of their suppliers which would be the very
antithesis of openness.
There is a far more worrying threat to open systems. Novell acquired Unix
Labs, which owns Unix, a few months ago. The company is determined to
challenge Microsoft's dominance and it will build volume not just for Unix,
but for its own Unix applications.
But Novell may go further than this. One senior vice-president was quoted in
July as saying, 'Unix will be proprietary'. Suddenly the idea of a closed
Unix is no longer unthinkable.
The computer market is intensely competitive. But unfortunately, the
hard-fought principle of open systems is in danger of being lost in the
process. It was users who fought for open systems; it will be users who
suffer in a conflict of this kind.
Bill Passmore is vice-president, northern Europe for Sun Microsystems.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Russians need creative
skills to succeed - Survival tactics in a country where capital investment
is hard to come by
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The screen flashes up an image of a Russian entrepreneur practising his
karate skills, then driving around Moscow in a Lada. 'This man has big
business on his hands: Russian knitwear,' a voice purrs in the background.
Alexander Panikin, 43, says he commissioned 'The Factory-Owner', a video
about his company Pan Inter, to present himself 'as an example to others'.
Promotional puff aside, he has grounds to boast. He manages one of Russia's
rare small businesses involved in manufacturing, at a time when
import-export operations dominate the new private economy.
Panikin's business has emerged from the ruins of seven decades in which, he
says, 'the Communists destroyed everything that moved'.
He was lucky to have accumulated capital in the dying years of the old
regime when prices were controlled by the state and money lending was cheap.
The irony today is that though prices have been liberalised, private trade
allowed and privatisation is officially under way, new businesses find it
virtually impossible to obtain finance for capital investment.
Last month the International Finance Corporation launched the first
international effort to stimulate small and medium-sized businesses in
Russia by lending Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) to a Russian commercial bank for
on-lending to new companies.
The IFC admits, however, that its contribution is just a drop in the ocean
for Russian business development, until Russian entrepreneurs are able to
mobilise the billions of dollars potentially available in domestic capital
when investment circumstances improve.
With inflation running at 1,000 per cent a year, most entrepreneurs and
banks have little incentive to launch into any project that does not bring
virtually immediate returns.
Entrepreneurs such as Panikin, who are showing the way by a combination of
hard work, luck and initiative, are indeed a rarity.
Panikin set up his factory, which now employs 700 people, with profits made
from a co-operative set up under legislation introduced by President Mikhail
Gorbachev in the late 1980s.
'I started off with six sewing machines but I had a profit margin of 600 per
cent,' he says, illustrating the pent up demand for consumer goods which
existed in Russia's then closed, and now still heavily militarised economy.
Today his margins have been reduced to 100 per cent by import
liberalisation, which has introduced competition, and by price
liberalisation, which has cut the population's purchasing power.
In an attempt to beat inflation, which destroys rouble earnings, he converts
his profits into hard currency and immediately ploughs them back into the
company.
Another challenge for business is that market institutions taken for granted
in the west, such as efficient suppliers, distributors, and a normal banking
system, are absent in Russia.
Panikin sells his clothes in 10 kiosks he owns around Moscow, which means he
works mainly with cash, and relies on his own sales network to find out what
sells and what prices he can get away with. In order to obtain the necessary
quality he dyes the threads used for his knitwear.
The IFC's lending initiative is part of the international effort to
stimulate business, but action needs to be taken in Russia to help budding
Panikins. Irina Razumnova, who heads a small business support centre with
funding from the cosmetics company Avon and the Canadian government, says:
it is no bad thing that small businesses find it difficult to raise finance
for manufacturing as it is services that are needed. She adds: 'The main
problem is that our people do not know how to work.' The business support
centre provides short courses in accounting and management skills.
Razumnova believes one of the biggest problems facing small businesses is
people attitudes: how do you change the habits of employees accustomed to a
system once jokingly described as 'pretending to pay the workers while they
pretend to work'.
Higher than average pay packets (the equivalent of around Dollars 100 a
month) are still topped up with subsidised food, such as sugar, which is
expensive in the shops, and other non-monetary benefits. Panikin's staff
also receive benefits - clothes can be purchased at a 50 per cent discount
from the sales price and Panikin has even given plots of land away to
workers.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Struggling with new
standards - BSI's environmental management system may cause difficulties for
small firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many small businesses struggling with BS5750, the British Standards
Institution's quality systems standard, may soon have to grapple with
BS7750, its successor for environmental management systems.
The BSI decided to develop the standard because it wanted to respond to
increasing concerns about environmental performance. BS7750 details a
specification for an environmental management system that will enable an
organisation to ensure compliance with its chosen environmental policies. It
also contains advice on how to put the system in place.
Having the management system will facilitate environmental auditing of the
organisation and compliance with BS7750 will prepare it for participation in
the EC's eco-management and audit scheme (Emas).
The environmental management system laid down in BS7750 has a lot in common
with that of BS5750. Indeed, the similarity in the numbering of the two
standards is intentional to demonstrate the strong links between them.
BS7750 can be seen as an add-on to BS5750.
Both standards have something else in common: just as compliance with BS5750
is no guarantee of an organisation's output being of high quality, since
low-quality targets can be set within the system, so compliance with BS7750
does not ensure good environmental performance. Toxic emission targets, for
example, could be set to unacceptably high levels.
A version of the standard has existed for over a year, but as yet the BSI
does not think it has been developed enough to issue certificates of
compliance.
Although at least one consultancy, SGS Yarsley ICS, has been granting
certificates, the BSI regards this as 'premature and misguided'.
But a pilot programme earlier this year to test the standard in more than
100 organisations has now ended, and a draft of the revised standard is out
for public consultation until the beginning of September.
The final version should appear by the beginning of December and widespread
certification should start after accreditation procedures have been set up
to vouch for certifiers. In fact, the only significant revisions in the
standard are those bringing it into line with Emas, under which businesses
will undergo environmental audits and publish results. Emas is set to get
fully underway in 1995.
The concern of small businesses is that BS7750 will cause them problems
similar to those of BS5750: disproportionately high implementation and
certification costs, and the thinning down of tender lists by excluding
those who do not have it.
'BS5750 is a nightmare for small businesses,' says Bernard Juby, trade
spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses. 'BS7750 we see as the
incestuous cousin - it's even worse.' Juby finds the standard more nebulous
than BS5750, and is apprehensive of some councils and large companies making
it mandatory in all but name for suppliers, in a similar way to that in
which some have dealt with BS5750.
'It's supposed to be a voluntary standard,' he complains of the latter.
Some of the businesses from the pilot scheme also think BS7750 is vaguer
than BS5750. 'It's probably slightly woollier because the subject area is
less easy to pin down and define,' says Sam Phillips, engineering manager at
the Mann Organisation, a 50-employee company which recycles computers and
electronic equipment.
The business has had to abandon implementation of BS7750 for the time being,
partly because it is still busy with BS5750. 'It would be very, very
difficult I think for anyone to implement BS7750 if they haven't actually
got BS5750,' says Phillips.
'If you're coming at it cold, particularly small businesses without BS5750,
they won't know their arse from their elbow,' agrees Richard Hall, TQM
systems manager of the Renlon Group, a Pounds 6m turnover, 60-employee
property preservation and construction company.
Chris Sheldon, the BSI's environmental spokesman, disagrees. He says
experiences on the pilot scheme varied. For example the group of companies
from the print and packaging sector, which included many small and
medium-sized businesses, say they do not think BS5750 is a prerequisite for
BS7750.
The signs are not promising for small businesses worrying about the expense
of compliance with another standard. Phillips and Hall have experienced
interest in their environmental management systems from large companies and
local councils.
'They haven't actually put pressure on us in the sense of having it
documented, but we have been audited by a couple of them to make sure that
what we're doing meets their standards,' says Phillips. He thinks that at
some point there may be insistence on compliance with BS7750 before
contracts are awarded.
One large company the Mann Organisation does business with is IBM. 'The most
likely position we would want to take with our suppliers for BS7750, once it
does finally emerge, is, in a nutshell, encouragement,' says Eric Dewhurst,
engineering services manager at IBM's manufacturing and development site in
Greenock, Scotland.
'It would not be a requirement in the sense of being mandatory.' He thinks
the company's policy will be similar to the one for BS5750, with which it
normally expects big companies to comply, but not necessarily small ones.
The Renlon Group is applying for membership of the London Borough of
Merton's approved contractors' scheme. BS5750 certification is not mandatory
to get onto tender lists for the council's contracts. 'We don't insist upon
it, but obviously when contractors are vetted to come in on the scheme we
ask for various safeguards in that respect,' says David Jones, a senior
building surveyor in the council's property services department. However,
Jones says the award of contracts can depend on whether a business has a
certificate or not, and it may not always be possible to take small
businesses' circumstances into account. Might they sometimes lose out as a
result? 'Possibly.'
Jones says that at present environmental management systems are sometimes
taken into account when awarding contracts and that compliance with BS7750
may be taken into account in the future. 'If suppliers can show that they're
moving towards that direction then I think we would take that on board in
the selection stage of tendering.'
The BSI is against mandatory application of BS5750 and is listening to small
businesses' criticisms. It has set up an independent committee with small
business representatives which is undertaking a survey of problems.
This may provide little insurance against future problems given the legal
and social context of BS7750. Large organisations are concerned about public
perceptions of their environmental performance and have legal
responsibilities under statutes such as the Environmental Protection Act
1990, the Water Resources Act 1991 and the Control of Pollution Act 1974.
'There will be an increasing trend for companies to require their suppliers
to have some form of qualification and the ready-made qualification off the
shelf is BS7750,' says Michael Renger, a partner in the environmental
department of lawyers Nabarro Nathanson.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Mine safety plans face court test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NACODS, the pit deputies' union, is threatening a legal challenge to
government plans for changes in coal industry safety regulations.
Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods general secretary, said yesterday that he would
seek a judicial review of the proposed changes, which he claimed would
severely weaken safety standards in the pits in preparation for their
privatisation next year.
The union's move comes as Mr Brian Langdon, deputy chief inspector of mines,
cast doubt over the view that alleged defects in roofbolting contributed to
last week's roof fall at Bilsthorpe colliery in Nottinghamshire in which
three men died.
He said he believed that the existence of old coal face workings alongside
the development was a big factor in the disaster.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, yesterday condemned the
government's safety reforms and said: 'The government should now abandon its
plans before more miners are killed. At the very least, it should wait until
parliament has had a chance to consider them.'
Mr O'Neill also called for a halt to the use of roofbolts pending the
outcome of the Bilsthorpe inquiry, saying that in 1990 the Commons energy
committee 'could not endorse the use of roofbolts'.
He added: 'Yet the government's advisers have consistently encouraged the
wider use of such American mining methods in order to increase
productivity.'
The new regulations were laid before parliament on August 6 and are due to
come into force on October 1.
The government said yesterday that it was open to any MP to question the
guidelines for up to 40 days after their introduction.
The Health and Safety commission drew up the regulations after discussions
over the past six years. Both Nacods and the National Union of Mineworkers
have opposed the regulations, arguing they will compromise safety - a charge
denied by the government, the commission and the British Association of
Colliery Management.
Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said the new
regulations - designed to replace detailed prescriptive statutes with more
flexible codes of practice - would make the mines safer as well as more
efficient.
They lay down training requirements, specific duties for employees, and the
preparation and duties of surveyors.
Nacods' main objection is to the proposed division in the role of pit
deputies. Under the new regulations it will be legally possible - but not
mandatory - to have different people responsible for pit inspection and
supervision.

THE LONDON Stock Exchange said that, from yesterday, trading prices for
smaller stocks will be more widely disseminated in an effort to increase
liquidity in less liquid issues.
The trading prices are for about 160 shares with only one registered
marketmaker or with no marketmaker and for which bargains must be transacted
through matching offers posted on the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading
Service (Seats).
Marketmakers have increasingly withdrawn their services from smaller
capitalised companies with shares traded on the exchange, greatly
diminishing liquidity for investors.
Since last November the exchange has been operating its Seats system with
price transparency - the last price at which a share was traded - available
only through its Topic screen.
From yesterday the exchange is making bargains in less liquid stocks
available to information vendors such as Reuters and Bloomberg at no
additional charge. Those information providers already sell exchange share
price information to users who do not have the Topic screen.
The service should make access to price quotes available to investors
outside the UK who would not normally have access to the Topic screen.
The improved service was developed by the London Stock Exchange in
conjunction with Andersen Consulting.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Counties seek EC funds to offset defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNTIES of Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire are making a joint bid
for European funding to counter the impact of defence cuts.
The counties are lobbying the government, which has until the end of this
month to apply to the EC for a Pounds 15m share of the Pounds 100m Konver
fund. The fund, announced in April by Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy
commissioner, and set up in June, is to help revitalise areas dependent on
the defence industry and military bases.
It is the first collaboration by the three counties on such an approach. The
bid, announced yesterday, is supported by the counties' training and
enterprise councils, by local MPs and MEPs, and by the newly formed Western
Development Partnership in Avon, a public and private-sector forum for
economic development.
Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire depend heavily on the defence industry.
Large local employers include British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and Dowty, and
there are about 70 military bases. It is estimated that Avon has lost more
than 7,000 defence-related jobs in the past six years.
The Confederation of British Industry has compared the impact of defence
cuts in south-west England to the effect on south Wales of the rundown of
the coal and steel industries.
The Konver fund will require matching finance from government, local
authorities or the private sector. It is subject to the principle of
additionality - that it co-finances projects which would otherwise not go
ahead and will have additional impact on the areas concerned.
The Department of Trade and Industry has to inform Brussels by August 31 of
the areas and kinds of project for which it is seeking Konver funds. The DTI
would then assess specific projects.
A study for the European Commission last year identified 24 EC regions where
defence employment was at least double the European average, including Avon,
Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, as well as Cornwall/Devon, Hampshire/Isle of
Wight, Cumbria and North Yorkshire.
Defence company Flight Refuelling is to shed 200 of its 1,000 workers at
Wimborne, Dorset, it said yesterday. It blamed cuts in the aerospace and
defence industries for the losses, which follow the axing of 100 jobs in
March.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Customers back 'green' efforts by Welsh Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE QUARTERS of Welsh Water customers believe it is unacceptable that
fewer than half of the households in the principality are connected to full
sewage treatment systems, the company said yesterday.
Welsh Water yesterday published the results of a Pounds 1.2m consultation
exercise which it claims is the most comprehensive survey since Ofwat, the
industry regulator, told the privatised companies last year to consult
customers on their investment plans.
More than 184,000 customers - 15 per cent of the total - returned
questionnaires and more than 2,000 were interviewed by market research
company Mori, allowing Welsh Water to draw conclusions on customer
priorities.
The overall message was that high standards for drinking-water quality
should be maintained and increases in bills should be kept at low as
possible. But most customers wanted priority to be given to environmental
improvements, for which they were prepared to pay at least Pounds 5 a year
more on their bills.
Mr Nigel Annett, director of quality and planning for Dwr Cymru, the
company's water and sewerage division, said: 'We have a very long coastline
and since Victorian times a lot of sewage has been simply flushed into the
sea without any treatment whatsoever. That is no longer acceptable. So we
have an enormous challenge ahead to sort that out.'
Welsh Water will now put to Ofwat a Pounds 1bn investment plan for 1995 to
2000.
Two thirds of the money will be spent on environmental improvements, with
annual bill increases of 2 percentage points above inflation, equivalent to
Pounds 5 a year on the average domestic bill. Bills averaged Pounds 213 last
year, the third-highest of any privatised water company.
Adoption of the plan will mean an increase to 90 per cent by the year 2000
of full treatment of sewage, completion of projects to enable all 51
designated coastal bathing waters in Wales to reach EC standards, and
replacement of half the existing lead pipes.
Just over half of the customers questioned said they were satisfied with
overall value for money but only a third of business customers were.
Businesses were less willing than householders to pay more for coastal and
river protection.
'Companies are obviously very concerned about any cost rising,' Mr Annett
said. 'What we were surprised to find was that there was a willingness by
them to pay for environmental improvement - not a great willingness to pay
but it is there.'
The survey showed that customers want a better basis for water charges. But
Welsh Water rejects universal metering because water is abundant in the
principality and the cost would be 'spectacular'.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Joint strategy to boost image of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Corporation of London and the London Docklands Development Corporation
are to make a joint promotion of London as a business district.
Next month's presentation in Hong Kong will be the first time two separate
London authorities have joined in promoting the capital since the formation
of London First, the business-led organisation set up last year.
Both participants claim the new development as a significant breakthrough in
the attempts to find a coherent new strategy for boosting the capital's
image.
The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, said: 'It is
important more for the fact that the two authorities have been able to
organise themselves than for what they will actually get out of it.'
It admitted that organisation had been easier because party politics had not
played a part, and that wider promotion of London could 'fall down' due to
difficulties in organisation.
Both Mr Michael Cassidy, the Corporation of London's policy chairman, and Mr
Michael Pickard, LDDC chairman, will address the 17th International Urban
Development Association conference. They have two purposes:
To increase interest in development and property opportunities in London.
To make a 'generic' promotion of London as a business centre.
They aim jointly to address the misconceptions about London held by
businesses in the Asia Pacific region. These include fears about the threat
of terrorism, the introduction of the new regime for advance corporation
tax, and increasing fears outside Europe that the community has become more
protectionist since the European summit in 1991.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Curbs on secrecy 'not enough'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN for Freedom of Information yesterday attacked government plans
to reduce secrecy, saying they did not go far enough.
The pressure group said last month's white paper on open government
contained some 'positive' elements but stopped well short of delivering
freedom of information.
There was now 'a foot in the door,' it said in the August issue of its
Secrets newspaper.
It was particularly critical of the proposed code of practice which would
require Whitehall to comply with reasonable requests for information.
Too many of the code's proposals represent victories for the 'culture of
government secrecy' which Mr William Waldegrave, the public services
minister, was trying to overturn.
The code's 'overwhelming, central flaw' was its rejection of direct access
to documents. The government was promising to answer questions, not let
people see correspondence, documents or reports.
The group welcomed the proposed statutory right of access to
non-computerised personal files and health and safety information.
Mr Waldegrave said last month that public access to information would be
restricted only where there were good reasons.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Tory MPs face 'civil war' over finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BITTER divisions within the Tory party erupted again yesterday as a
rightwing Conservative MP accused some colleagues on the left of the party
of trying to create 'civil war'.
The fresh outbreak of acrimony came as the rift within the party over
government finances was highlighted with a call from a left-of-centre
Conservative for an increase in the top rate of income tax.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the party's backbench finance committee,
attacked loyalists who had called for rebels to be purged from the
influential executive of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs in the
annual elections in the autumn.
Sir George Gardiner, the chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory MPs; Mr
Townend and Sir Ivan Lawrence are the most prominent members of the
executive in the loyalists' sights. Mr Townend's position on the backbench
finance committee could also come under attack.
Mr Townend warned that it would be very damaging if the 1922 Committee did
not reflect opinion on the right as well as the left of the party, 'and that
would be the last thing John Major would want'.
Although government loyalists were angry about the persistent revolts during
the passage of the Maastricht bill, once the prime minister had won the
confidence motion in the Commons in late July, senior backbenchers insisted
there would be no 'witch-hunt'.
Party managers have underlined the need for the party to unite, but the
control of public spending and possible tax rises have provided a new focus
for competing ideological pressures.
Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for Leeds North West, yesterday called for a rise
in the top rate of income tax from 40 per cent to 45 per cent. He argued
that the almost Pounds 1.8bn raised would enable cuts in tax for those in
middle-income groups to go ahead.
He told BBC Radio: 'You could then have plenty of scope for indexing
properly the top rate, you could have scope for broadening the bottom 20 per
cent range, and still have a major contribution to paying off the shortfall
in the public spending borrowing requirement.'
His suggestion was immediately rejected by Mr Townend, who said that tax
increases of about Pounds 10bn had already been accepted through measures
such as the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel. Mr Townend said
that the emphasis should now be on public spending cuts.

THE JURY in the Homes Assured Corporation fraud trial was sent to a hotel
last night after failing to reach a verdict.
The three women and eight men have spent four months in Southwark Crown
Court hearing more than 100 prosecution witnesses give evidence against the
group's founder, Mr Anthony Dobson, and two other former directors, on
charges arising from the venture's Pounds 10.7m collapse four years ago.
The 60-year-old businessman, of Glebe Place, Chelsea, south-west London, who
set up the corporation in 1987 to help council tenants buy their homes,
denies trading fraudulently between November 1988 and August 1989.
HAC managing director Mr Michael Robinson, 42, of Edith Terrace, Fulham,
south-west London, and Mr Keith Woodward, 56, of Blake Hall Road, Wanstead,
east London, also deny the charge.
Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable
security by deception and Woodward denies one charge of furnishing false
information.
The jury will resume deliberations today.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Holiday price war provokes more cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD yesterday joined the other big tour operators by announcing
large price cuts in family holidays for summer 1994 in its Enterprise
brochure.
The move follows price cuts and early-booking incentives offered last week
by rivals including Thomson and Thomas Cook.
The big tour operators continued to claim a high level of early bookings for
summer 1994. Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said business was '100 per cent
up on the same period last year. We have not seen this sort of reaction
since the mid-1980s'.
Airtours is set to announce its full programme later this week.
Thomson, the biggest tour operator, earlier said it had sold almost 250,000
summer 1994 holidays in two days. It has predicted that as many as 2m summer
1994 holidays will be booked by Christmas.
Owners Abroad said bookings for three of the company's main destinations had
been down this summer - Cyprus (down 26 per cent), Portugal (10 per cent)
and Greece (1 per cent) - but it still expected to take two million people
on holiday in 1993.
Mr Dermot Blastland, managing director of tour operations, said winter
1993-94 bookings were going well and he expected a 5 per cent to 10 per cent
increase in the number of people taking package holidays in summer 1994.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Securities firms in capital squeeze: The awkward effects of
a European directive regulating investment activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN FOR those well-versed in the complex phraseology of European
directives, the Capital Adequacy Directive is vexatious.
Translated into English it means that most of Britain's securities industry
will have to use a new measure of financial strength.
Until now the investment industry has had to meet capital requirements set
out by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory
watchdog. SIB officials are careful to point out that for a large number of
firms the cumulative capital requirement will not change. Capital may simply
be allocated differently among various business activities.
For a significant minority, however, changes will be needed. A key
difference will be that for the first time firms which do not handle client
money or trade on their own account will need to meet an initial capital
requirement of Ecu50,000 (Pounds 38,000).
Those which do handle client money will need Ecu125,000 and those which deal
on their own account and underwrite issues will need Ecu730,000.
Under current UK rules there is no initial capital requirement. All capital
requirements are related strictly to the degree of risk involved in
specified activities. The rules require firms to hold enough capital to
cover fixed overheads for various periods and to hold capital against
trading positions, the amount dependent on the amount of risk.
The directive requires all firms to have enough capital to cover fixed
overheads for 13 weeks. While this is already required of larger UK
stock-broking and money management firms, smaller fund managers and
investment advisers of other types need capital to cover only four to six
weeks of fixed costs.
The so-called position risk requirements, which will mostly affect
securities firms that are members of the Securities and Futures Authority,
are in some respects less stringent than those already in place. An SFA
official said: 'We are concerned that some firms might actually end up with
lighter capital requirements than they now have.'
Some firms will face tougher position limits than at present, however.
Current rules apply very low requirements for securities firms that trade
equities for their own book and meet strict portfolio diversification
requirements. The directive makes no adjustments for the extent to which
diversification reduces risk and some securities firms, in particular the
larger ones, may have to hold more capital against their portfolios.
Even among firms with no interest in operating abroad, hundreds may find
that they need to raise additional capital or alter their business mix.
An SIB official said: 'A lot of firms will think, 'Well, I'm not going to
use the European passport so this won't affect me'.'
But the regional stockbroker in Maidstone is as much subject to the new
rules as SG Warburg, a fact which has not yet fully penetrated the industry,
regulators say.
Regulators point to a number of mitigating factors. First, the directive
applies only to investment business as defined by another piece of Brussels
legislation, the Investment Services Directive. That excludes firms which
only give advice.
Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for financial advisers and intermediaries,
estimates this is the case for more than 80 per cent of its members.
There is another escape, under which firms that do not have enough initial
capital will still be allowed to operate. However, all firms will have to
meet the other expenditure and position risk require-ments.
Firms which take advantage of this arrangement will be required to calculate
their current capital and monitor it until the directive takes effect on
December 31 1995.
Subsequently they will have to ensure that their capital never falls below
the highest point reached during this reference period.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Fare fears shunt railway funding to the fore: Sell-off
critics are making much mileage out of plans for Network SouthEast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCUSATIONS and counter-accusations continued to fly yesterday over leaked
plans for 16 per cent fare increases in British Rail's Network SouthEast
region.
While the leak has been interpreted as an attempt to provide further bad
publicity for the government's plans to privatise the railways, the problems
revealed highlight Network SouthEast's continuing funding problems,
regardless of any change of ownership. They increase the pressure on Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, to decide on funding priorities for
transport.
The scale of the increases outlined in the leaked document has alarmed many
Tory MPs in the south-east.
Local elections in the London boroughs next May - the Tories are already
braced to do badly in them - will add to the political sensitivity of the
decisions on fares.
Parliament has still to complete its discussion of the rail privatisation
legislation. Further debates in October will give dissatisfied Tories an
opportunity to press for concessions.
Network SouthEast says that Pounds 460m is needed annually until the end of
the decade 'simply to maintain the status quo'. This would allow for
replacing outdated rolling stock and essential maintenance, but would not
include extra routes or rolling stock.
Project investment for next year has been funded at Pounds 420m, according
to Network SouthEast, leaving a Pounds 40m shortfall.
The Department of Transport refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of
the discussion documents, which were leaked to the environmental pressure
group Transport 2000.
But it was clear that many proposals for Network SouthEast had already been
floated by policymakers, and officials said that no clear decisions had yet
been taken.
Three options are suggested in the documents. All are aimed at keeping
within the government's 'Rail Plan' financial targets for British Rail, and
do not take into account any extra costs caused by privatisation.
They also involve rectifying shortfalls for the current financial year, and
do not therefore affect the next Autumn Statement on total government
expenditure in November.
They are:
The 'preferred' plan of a 16.2 per cent rise in price for Travelcards, used
on rail, Underground and buses in Greater London, coupled with a 12 per cent
increase for standard single-day fares and a 7.9 per cent rise for season
tickets.
A 'first alternative', with Travelcards raised by 10.3 per cent, season
tickets by 8.5 per cent and single-day fares by 12 per cent.
A 'second alternative' in which Travelcards would be increased by a
relatively modest 6.3 per cent, season tickets by 6 per cent and standard
day fares by 8.0 per cent.
The 'first alternative', according to the notes leaked to Transport 2000,
has been framed with the London borough elections in mind, as fare increases
would be lower in the capital.
The 'second alternative', which would be most politically acceptable, fails
to raise enough revenue to meet the Rail Plan targets. This would leave the
network with the problem of underfunding and investment would need to be cut
further in an attempt to meet the targets, according to the leaked
documents.
The framework for the discussions between British Rail and the Department of
Transport was set by the tough spending settlement in last November's public
spending statement, which saw a slender increase in the grants for British
Rail from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.49bn. Spending on roads was left
unscathed at more than Pounds 2bn a year for three years.
Network SouthEast defended itself against criticisms of service quality, and
said that a recent survey had shown it to be ahead of the French SNCF's
Paris service by 7.8 per cent on measures of reliability and punctuality.
It admitted, however, that it received a Pounds 300m government grant last
year, and even when this was included made a surplus of only Pounds 5m. This
apparent profit was chiefly attributable to a change in accounting
conventions, it said.
In preceding years it had consistently returned a loss, according to
Department of Transport figures, of Pounds 154.9m in 1990-91 - when total
government subsidies to the British Rail network were Pounds 700m  - and of
Pounds 138.1m in 1989-90 - when total subsidies were Pounds 635m.
Mr Stephen Joseph, director of Transport 2000, said: 'The government is
facing quite severe choices. They have to decide on transport priorities,
and whether they divert money to road or to rail.
'How that is affected by privatisation is unclear.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / Japanese boost for car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE carmakers accounted for more than a fifth of UK car output in the
first six months this year.
Sharply rising production by Nissan and the start-up of Toyota and Honda
plants are compensating for falling output by the traditional car producers.
Overall production rose by 8.2 per cent in the first half of the year to
743,000, helped by a near doubling of output at Nissan's Sunderland plant in
north-east England.
Nissan added a second model, the Micra small car, to its plant in the second
half of 1992. It still forecasts a 51 per cent rise in output to 270,000
this year from 179,000 last year, in spite of a sharp decline in demand in
mainland Europe.
In the first half of the year Nissan increased its output by 90 per cent to
141,000 from 74,000 a year ago, while Honda produced 13,000 cars at its
plant at Swindon, Wiltshire, and Toyota assembled 15,300 cars at its plant
at Burnaston, near Derby, according to figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Ford, Peugeot and Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US,
all suffered from falling production as exports were hit by the decline in
mainland European sales.
Overall UK output has benefited from the growing popularity in Europe of
four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicles, which are carving a significant
niche in the car market.
The society's figures also disclose the full impact on UK commercial vehicle
output of the financial demise of Daf, the former Anglo-Dutch van and
truckmaker, which collapsed into receivership at the beginning of February.
Both UK production operations have since been rescued by management
buy-outs, but in the first half of the year Leyland Daf van production fell
58 per cent and Leyland truck output dived 62 per cent. Overall UK
commercial vehicle production dropped 24 per cent.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Tories feel the strain of paying for the train
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brighton Evening Argus said it all. 'Rail fares fury' screamed the
headline over an article calculating that proposed British Rail fare rises
leaked this weekend would force Brighton commuters to pay at least Pounds
172 more for their Pounds 2,347 annual season tickets to London.
Judging by the mood in Brighton yesterday the sentiment was shared by many -
not only among the town's commuters but also in the embattled local
Conservative party.
Sussex has long been part of the south of England Tory heartland, but a
gradual erosion of the party's vote - in May's local elections it lost
control of the county councils in East and West Sussex for the first time -
has left many local Tories increasingly nervous about the impact of the rail
fares issue.
Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory MP for Brighton Kemptown, who has a slim 3,000
majority, lost no time in expressing his concern. 'If they try to impose a
16 per cent increase, all hell will break loose in the constituency. I am
sure they won't do it,' he said.
With a 'huge number' of commuters in his constituency, increasing fares
could only exacerbate the anti-Tory swing, he added.
At the local Conservative headquarters the mood was more restrained.
Ms Pat Smith, Tory agent for the town's two parliamentary constituencies -
the other, Pavilion, has a 3,500 majority - insisted there was little sign
of outright rebellion so far.
'Normally can I tell if there's a lot of Conservative party dissatisfaction
from the number of people ringing me. There hasn't been any phone calls so
far,' she said.
But privately other local Tories admitted they were incensed. 'It's supposed
to be a public service, and this just isn't a public service at all. Of
course there is a lot of anger,' complained one local councillor.
Mr Adam Trimingham, political correspondent on the Evening Argus, put it
more bluntly. 'The two Tory seats in Brighton are both marginal seats . . .
This is going to have a big impact.'
Not all the passengers on the platforms yesterday agreed with such
sentiments.
Mr Chris Wilson, who commutes from Brighton to a solicitor's office to
Burgess Hill, on the line to London, said: 'It won't stop me going on the
train. Even with big increases it is still the cheapest way to get to work.
It won't make me vote against the government.'
But Ms Shelley Atlas, chairman of the Brighton line commuters pressure
group, and a daily commuter to London, insists that the increases would
reduce the number of passengers. 'It's going to hit the lowest-paid
commuters hardest of all. A lot of employers are freezing wages, so its
going to be very hard to cope with a big jump,' she said.
Mr Peter Chester, deputy chief executive of the Sussex chamber of Commerce,
shared her concerns. 'Companies here are trying to keep wage increases down.
This is not going to help,' he said.
With unemployment in the town running at 15 per cent, some of the most
bitter complaints came from those without work.
Mr Gary Cross, who is unemployed and who makes regular leisure trips between
Crawley and Brighton, said: 'I will definitely be going less by rail if they
put on those increases.
'Those who have got good jobs in the City can easily afford an extra 30 quid
or whatever. It's the housewives and others without jobs that can't - and
they vote, don't they.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / Welsh wind farm project unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for a wind farm in Wales will be set out today, as increasing
tensions emerge among environmentalists about whether to support wind power.
Trigen Windpower, a venture by British, Japanese and Californian renewable
energy specialists, is seeking planning permission from Port Talbot council
for the Pounds 4m project. It wants to erect 66 170ft-high turbines on
forestry land near Hirwaun, Mid-Glamorgan.
Earlier this month Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, approved a wind
farm in Cornwall, overturning the local authority. Two more wind projects
have been referred to Mr Gummer, and a further six are on appeal after
having been refused by councils.
Some environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, want more electricity
generated by wind power to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the
gases implicated in global warming. But others, such as the Council for the
Protection of Rural England, say the turbines disfigure the countryside,
while local residents have complained about noise.
There are also concerns about the cost: electricity generated from wind
power costs up to 12p for a kilowatt hour compared with the 2.5p-3p that
electricity fetches on the wholesale market, and the 8p that households pay
for it.
Trigen said its 20MW farm would provide enough electricity for 17,000 homes
and would have a minimal impact on the landscape and local residents. It
would be fed into Port Talbot's power supply. Trigen said: 'A coal-fired
power station, producing the same amount of electricity, would also produce
over 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide as well as other damaging pollutants.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / Cable groups' Mercury deal undercuts BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION between British Telecommunications and local cable operators is
expected to intensify with the signing of a new agreement between leading
operators and Mercury Communications.
The agreement yesterday gives the cable companies improved rates for
completing the long-distance parts of calls made on their local phone
networks, and will enable them to undercut BT's prices further in their
franchise areas.
The cable companies - General Cable, Nynex, Encom, Southwestern Bell,
TeleWest and Videotron - control 60 local franchises between them, and
provide most of the estimated 180,000 cable telephone lines currently in
service.
The agreement revises tariffs for carrying their long-distance traffic on
Mercury's network. It covers traffic for which Mercury provides the
switching facilities and also business that operators choose to switch
through their own facilities.
At present Mercury switches nearly all cable traffic across the network.
However, cable operators are keen to do their own switching, to give greater
flexibility in services and choice of long-distance carrier. Last week one
operator switched its own traffic for the first time, and the others are
expected to follow.
Earlier this month the cable companies signed an agreement with BT which
reportedly gave them 50 per cent of the gross call revenues for traffic
switched by the cable operators, against about 25 per cent under the old
Mercury agreement.
The operators would not disclose the precise figures in yesterday's deal,
but the new Mercury agreement gives them better overall terms than those
available with BT and they intend to continue using Mercury for the bulk of
their long-distance traffic.
Though Mercury was under pressure to match the BT offer, it also has an
interest in the cable operators flourishing at the expense of BT. Take-up of
cable telephony is as high as 30 per cent in some franchise areas, which
represents significant extra revenue for Mercury as long-distance carrier.
Mr Eugene Connell, director of Nynex's UK operations, said: 'The new
agreement reflects our commitment to developing a real alternative to BT in
the local market.'
Mr Andy Coleman, managing director of Mercury's business and consumer
division, claimed the agreement 'strengthened' its relationship with the
cable operators.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Allied-Lyons in Indian whisky deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIRAM WALKER, the spirits and wine division of Allied-Lyons, is to establish
a joint venture in India with Jagatjit Industries of New Delhi, one of the
country's largest liquor producers.
The 50/50 venture will bottle Scotch whisky in India and launch a range of
locally-produced spirits for the domestic and international markets.
After decades of warding off foreign liquor manufacturers and encouraging a
thriving market for spurious 'scotch', India has opened its doors to the
world's premium Scotch whisky-makers.
Allied is the third UK-based drinks company to enter the Pounds 800m market
under the Indian government's liberalisation programme.
Guinness and Grand Metropolitan have already announced the formation of
partnerships with Indian companies.
Seagram, the Canadian liquor and foods giant, has also been allowed to set
up a wholly-owned subsidiary to make or blend 25,000 kilolitres of spirits a
year.
Though the Allied-Jagatjit venture is not expected to make a significant
contribution to Allied's profits for some years, Mr David Jarvis, chief
executive of Hiram Walker, said yesterday: 'We believe India has great
potential for our products.
'We are delighted that the Indian government's positive policy for inward
investment now allows us to be associated with Jagatjit.'
The Indian government has not allowed foreign liquor companies to set up
manufacturing capacities, and they will have to rely on the existing
facilities of their joint venture partners, or purchase Indian spirits
through contracts.
Jagatjit, which commands more than 25 per cent of the country's liquor
market, is involved in the manufacture and marketing of malt, malt extract,
dairy and food products, as well as in the production of bottling and
packaging material.
The Rs100m (Pounds 2.2m) project in Maharashtra will import Scotch and
bottle it in India for local sale and export to Gulf countries and possibly
to South East Asia.
The company will bottle up to 30,000 cases of Scotch a year, and another
30,000 cases of blends with locally-made alcohol.
Exports have been made mandatory in order to offset import costs.
The Indian demand for Scotch is estimated at 1m cases a year, more than 75
per cent of which are spurious or adulterated, and 90 per cent of which are
smuggled.

THE Indian government has approved the formation of joint ventures between
UK Scotch makers Hiram Walker and Grand Metropolitan's International
Distillers and Vintner's drinks division and Indian partners to market
Scotch whisky in India, and to manufacture a range of indigenous spirits.
After decades of warding off foreign liquor manufacturers and encouraging a
thriving market for spurious 'scotch', India has opened its doors to the
world's premium Scotch whisky-makers.
United Distillers, the spirits arm of Guinness, received a similar approval
in June, while Seagram, the Canadian liquor and foods giant, has been
allowed to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary to make or blend 25,000
kilolitres of spirits a year.
Hiram Walker, the UK-based subsidiary of Allied Lyons, the Canadian foods
group, and makers of Teacher's and Ballantine's Scotch, has joined up with
Jagatjit Industries, the Indian liquor and foods group, which commands over
25 per cent of the country's liquor market. The Rs100m (Pounds 2.2m) project
in Maharashtra will import Scotch and bottle it in India for local sale and
export to the Gulf countries and possibly to South East Asia. The company
will bottle up to 30,000 cases of Scotch a year, and another 30,000 cases of
blends with locally-made alcohol. Exports have been made mandatory to offset
import costs.
Grand Met said last week that its drinks division would hold a majority
interest in the new company, International Distillers India, but an Indian
partner and details of the joint venture are yet to be announced. The new
venture will produce and market popular brands such as Smirnoff vodka,
Gilbey's and Chelsea gin, Malibu coconut liqueur and Archer's schnapps.
The government has not allowed foreign liquor companies to set up
manufacturing capacities, and they will have to rely on the existing
facilities of their joint venture partners, or purchase Indian spirits
through contracts.
The Canadian foods and liquor company will invest Rs250m to build a fruit
juices and products facility with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes a year, and
establish research and development facilities, besides making or blending
Scotch.
The Indian demand for Scotch is estimated at 1m cases a year, over 75 per
cent of which are spurious or adulterated, and 90 per cent of which are
smuggled. The Indian market for premium whiskies is wider, at 25m cases.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Atwood barter deal takes the biscuit -
Moneyless trade is being made relevant to mainstream business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Keebler, the troubled US biscuit maker, saw a high-profile product
launch fall flat in autumn last year it was left with Dollars 1m (Pounds
660,000) of unusable packaging.
Rather than write it off as scrap, Keebler talked to Atwood Richards, a
leading US barter group.
Instead of buying the packaging alone, Atwood asked Keebler, the US
subsidiary of United Biscuits of the UK, to fill the packs with biscuits and
agreed to buy the filled packs - worth Dollars 14m - for sale only in
markets where Keebler had no presence. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the
Baltic states were targeted.
Keebler was to be paid in 'trade credits', which were eventually exchanged
for packaging, shipping services and marketing. Atwood used roubles paid by
the Russians to buy local products and services.
Atwood also offered Keebler the right to take over the distribution network
it had set up in eastern Europe.
For Keebler the deal had many attractions: it did not have to write off
out-dated stock; it exploited unused capacity on its production line to fill
the packs; it was paid the full wholesale price - or its equivalent in trade
credits - for its incremental production; and gained, at no cost, marketing
and distribution networks in new markets.
Atwood's distinction over 35 years as a trader has been to stretch the
boundaries of barter. The sector is more traditionally associated with
commodity trading, the former communist regimes of east and central Europe,
and with the disaster-driven improvisations of companies trying to fend off
the receiver.
It may be a fashion house with an over-run of this year's colour; a men's
suitmaker who missed this season's switch to double-breasted suits; a
factory with unused capacity in the winter season - or Keebler packaging
made useless by a new marketing campaign.
With an estimated Dollars 13bn of unused or surplus merchandise in
warehouses across the US alone, Mr Moreton Binn, principal shareholder in
Atwood, has the chance to make barter relevant to mainstream business
wherever it is based.
'This year's swimwear is not like Chateau Lafite Rothschild - it doesn't get
better next year,' he says. Garments account for perhaps 40 per cent of
Atwood's overall business. Seasonal goods ranging from beach umbrellas to
golf clubs and skateboards are also significant as retailers need to clear
shelf space before autumn and winter.
'The world is a buffet,' Mr Binn notes. 'There is always somebody, some
place in the world that uses or needs barter.'
A businessman has to have alternatives, he says. 'When someone shuts down
the motorway, you have to find an alternative route to a destination.'
Atwood's business is finding alternatives. Its distinctive strengths have to
be in marketing, distribution, and achieving a range in the inventory of
goods and services it can offer to clients. Companies can spend their trade
credits on products as diverse as packaging, office furniture, hydraulic
presses, mainframe computers and refractory products, and services such as
airline seats, hotel rooms, cleaning services, or television advertising
space.
It has bought and sold between Omega, the watchmaker, US Steel, Goodyear
Tire and Rubber, Canon, Massey Ferguson, Amoco and JC Penny.
Mr Trevor Edwards, head of the group's London office, confesses that the
first response of a company executive to an approach from Atwood is cool.
'People are approached almost on a daily basis by people wanting to buy
stock for cash. But the offers are so derisory that they ignore them. Often
they're as low as 20 per cent of wholesale value. When I say we will buy at
near to wholesale price, companies often think it's another come-on,' he
says.
In Skelmersdale, Lancashire, Mr Geoff Marsden, managing director of Snack
Factory, a recently established supplier of crisps and other snack foods to
the UK market, was no exception when he received a cold call from Mr Edwards
to discuss a barter deal worth Pounds 5m a year for two years, allowing
Atwood to sell the company's crisps across Europe. 'I'm treating all this
with my tongue in my cheek, but there is no cost for me to try it,' he says.
'At present, I can't think of a negative. It allows me to do some test
marketing and establish distribution in markets I don't have the time or
resources to target myself.' Whether the deal goes ahead depends on the
results of market research being carried out by Atwood - another plus for Mr
Marsden, who could not afford to pay for this across Europe.
In the four months since Atwood set up in London the company has garnered 40
clients and has signed five barter contracts, ranging from Nottingham lace
and biscuits from Cornwall, to office furniture from Bath, athletics wear
from Scotland, and denim jeans from a London company.
According to Mr Binn there are just four components of a company's costs
that cannot be bartered for: wages, rents, utilities such as water and
electricity, and bank charges. Beyond these, which may account for half a
company's outlay, there is no reason any other cost must be monetised.
He challenges the suggestion that his company might be seen as a vulture,
feeding on recession-injured companies.
'The business survives at all times. Not all businesses do well at the same
time. Nor is the world that efficient. And trying to predict what the market
for your product is going to look like next year is the biggest gamble of
all.'
Mr Edwards is more vehement, regretting that Atwood had not been set up in
the UK in 1989. 'There are companies that have failed, and people that have
lost jobs, where this need not have happened if we had been here.'

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: ADollars 2.4bn Australian rail link
proposed

<TEXT>
FRANCO-BRITISH engineering company GEC Alsthom NV wants to build a
high-speed rail link between Sydney and Canberra, government officials said
on Monday, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Work would start on the ADollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn) project in 1996 and
Speedrail, as it is dubbed, would be running by 1999, according to the
proposal.
Industry minister Alan Griffiths wants to meet the developers, a government
spokesman said. 'Obviously this a project of national significance - we'd
like to discuss it further.'
GEC Alsthom is half-owned by Britain's General Electric Co and Alcatel
Alsthom SA of France, a spokeswoman for the company's Sydney subsidiary
said.
The trains, modelled on the Train a Grande Vitesse now operating in France,
would travel at 350 km (217 miles) an hour and take 75 minutes to cover the
distance between the nation's capital of Canberra and the country's most
populous city.
A second stage linking Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane with Sydney and
Canberra is also being studied, the sources said.
The developers have sent their proposal to the federal, New South Wales and
Australian Capital Territory governments.
GEC Alsthom would supply the rolling stock for the project, which would
create up to 35,000 jobs, the sources said.
A similar plan was proposed by a consortium led by Broken Hill Pty but
shelved in 1991 after the federal government refused developers' request for
tax breaks during the construction phase.
The Speedrail proposal makes no such request. About 80 per cent of the
projected cost is expected to be spent in Australia, the sources said.
GEC Alsthom last week won a contract to help build a 400 km high-speed rail
link in South Korea, a project expected to cost USDollars 13.2bn with
completion in 2002.

FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Miti probes Toshiba chip export claim -
Plan to transfer technology to East Germany denied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry is investigating a
claim that Toshiba, a leading electronics maker, had agreed to transfer
technology to former East Germany that would have breached an
internationally agreed export ban to communist countries.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, confirmed Miti was examining
the allegations, contained in a Japanese daily newspaper.
The Sankei Shimbun newspaper claimed Toshiba had agreed in 1986 to transfer
semiconductor chip technology to East Germany that would have breached rules
set up by the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls
(Cocom). The group was set up in 1951 by Nato to monitor and control the
export of products and technical data of potential strategic value to Warsaw
Pact countries and their allies.
The newspaper said it had secret documents from East Germany indicating that
Toshiba and Mitsui, the trading house, had agreed to help build a factory to
manufacture 256-kilobit dynamic random access memory chips.
Toshiba, however, scrapped the deal after it was revealed in 1987 that a
subsidiary of the company had exported machine tools to the former Soviet
Union. This resulted in the company being excluded from US government
procurement for three years.
Toshiba yesterday denied the latest allegations, saying it had made no
agreement with East Germany on the transfer of semiconductor technology. The
company said it followed strict export guidelines.
Toshiba said that between 1986 and 1987 the East German government had asked
it to transfer technology for the manufacture of printed circuit boards and
transistors for colour televisions, neither of which would have been in
breach of Cocom rules. Mitsui was involved in the talks.
When the sales of machine tools to the Soviet Union came to light in March
1987, Toshiba cancelled the TV transistor technology contract it had signed
with the East Germans and called off talks on the transfer of circuit board
technology.
Miti said it had investigated the chip issue in 1988 - finding no evidence
that Toshiba had agreed to transfer semiconductor technology to East Germany
 -but was reinvestigating since fresh allegations had surfaced.
Cocom still prohibits the transfer of technology for the manufacture of
certain advanced semiconductor chips and the export of some semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.

POLICE in London's Covent Garden have made 100 arrests this year as a result
of an initiative with Mercury Paging. Using radiopaging technology,
shopkeepers in the area are able to inform other retailers and the police of
crimes in progress or people acting suspiciously.
With PC Alan Marcroft (left), who made the 100th arrest - a suspected
shoplifter at the Royal Opera House shop in James Street - are Ms Gina
Bruce, the deputy manageress of the shop, and Mr Chris Neary, managing
director of Mercury Paging.
Mr Neary said yesterday: 'Covent Garden was one of the first areas to adopt
the scheme which has now spread to other UK shopping centres and groups of
pubs which suffer from vandalism, drug abuse and violence.'

The ANC leader, Mr Nelson Mandela, who ordered the inquiry, said the
organisation was taking it very seriously. 'The very fact that we have taken
the public into our confidence about the report . . . which has found that
serious violations of human rights have been committed, is an indication of
our good faith.'
The report documented executions, torture, beatings and human rights abuses
against ANC members held in camps. It said 15 people were executed by ANC
firing squads.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Nigerian military faces protests

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S pro-democracy campaign groups have called a three-day stoppage to
back Mr Moshood Abiola's claim to be the next president and to oppose the
military regime's plan to hand over to an unelected interim government on
Friday, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
The two previous civilian protests organised by the Campaign for Democracy
in recent weeks halted normal business life in the commercial capital,
Lagos, and other parts of the Yoruba-speaking south-west, the stronghold of
Mr Abiola, but failed to make an impact in the east or north of Nigeria.
Although the CD lacks a national network, it has done more than any other
organisation to voice dissatisfaction with President Ibrahim Babangida's
eight-year-old regime, which has four times postponed its promised
transition to democracy. The protest is aimed at building up pressure on the
government to step down before Friday, when the Nigeria Labour Congress has
threatened a national strike.
Nigeria partially lifted the domestic oil price subsidy from midnight by
introducing a premium grade of petrol worth N7 (20p) a litre. A state
broadcast last night said ordinary grade will still sell at N0.7 a litre but
industry says it will soon be unavailable.
Higher fuel prices could wipe out the budget deficit and revive the
downstream oil industry, but in April the military government judged the
price rise a threat to the transition to democracy, which has now been
abandoned.
Mr Mike McCurry, US State Department spokesman, threatened yesterday to cut
off more aid to Nigeria unless President Babangida keeps his promise to turn
over power by the end of the month.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Hosokawa stresses quality of life as goal of policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday said the country
needed to bring down its current account surplus 'not just to maintain good
external economic relations but also to improve the quality of Japanese
life'.
In his first policy speech to the Diet (parliament), he said he would seek
to make Japan 'a country of quality and substance', at ease with the world
and with itself.
He also pledged political reform by the end of the year, in what is the main
aim of the seven-party coalition, which this month displaced the long-ruling
Liberal Democratic party. However, he was vague about the shape of the
reform, over which the partners are still divided.
His address contained no new initiatives but appeared to indicate a number
of shifts in emphasis. He placed greater stress than before on the funding
of parties and politicians as a source of corruption. Such contributions
would be replaced by 'neutral, untainted public funding and other
provisions', he said, in a reference to possible tax incentives for
individual donors.
The coalition's ability to curb corporate contributions without being seen
as victimising the LDP was given a strong boost last week when the
Keidanren, the leading business grouping, said it would stop acting as a
conduit for political funds - nearly all of which went to the LDP.
Mr Hosokawa took care to note the difficulties caused by Japan's high
current account surplus in relations with the US and EC. He intended to seek
its reduction by working for 'expanded domestic demand and improved market
access, and for such consumer-oriented policies as rectifying the disparity
between domestic and international prices and promoting deregulation'.
This was the approach announced following a meeting of economic ministers
last Thursday. The US Federal Reserve stepped in later that day to assist
the Bank of Japan in stemming a rise in the yen, which Washington had
recently been thought to favour as a way to curb Japanese exports. Although
the countries deny having done a deal, the move also followed a telephone
conversation that day between Mr Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.
The two are to hold a summit in late September, following framework talks
earlier in the month on trade issues which Mr Hosokawa said were crucial.
Japan may again need the Fed's assistance before that - the yen rebounded by
Y1.10 against the dollar in Tokyo yesterday to Y103.35.
The prime minister was otherwise cautious on international issues. Noting
that 'protectionist moves seem to be on the rise', he said failure of the
Uruguay Round of trade talks would 'have a grave impact on the world
economy'. But he referred only obliquely to the problem of Japan's refusal
to open its rice market, saying agriculture was a difficult issue for all
countries and he would seek a solution based on 'mutual co-operation under
our basic policy'.
Mr Hosokawa expressed remorse and apologies for war actions 'including
aggression and colonial rule'. Under evident pressure from conservatives in
the coalition, he added that there were also 'supreme sacrifices made during
the war' by Japanese.
For the future, he said Japan must avoid 'falling prey to great-power
ambitions' but should become 'a country of unpretentious excellence' in
government, business and everyday life. His phrase recalls the 'lifestyle
superpower' envisaged by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, his LDP predecessor, but with a
stronger commitment to social justice and consumer interests.
Mr Yohei Kono, leader of the LDP, members of which heckled repeatedly during
the speech, said afterwards: 'He speaks of reform but he is adopting a
conventional policy line.'
Mr Hosokawa said Japan's ageing society made a review of the tax structure a
priority, to balance income, property and consumption taxes. The Social
Democratic party, the largest coalition member, has opposed suggestions by
some of its partners that consumption tax should be increased from the
present 3 per cent.
Reflecting the mixed signals from official data, Mr Hosokawa said there were
indications that 'the domestic economy is finally emerging from the depths
into which it was thrown' but 'it would not do to take economic recovery for
granted'. His aim was to 'create a climate conducive to the freer exercise
of private-sector initiative'.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Algeria's PM is casualty of his 'war economy': The problems
inherited by a new prime minister after the failure of the last one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the 13 months that he was prime minister of Algeria, Mr Belaid
Abdessalam displayed a genius for putting people's backs up. His
appointment, in the wake of the slaying of president Mohamed Boudiaf, owed
much to his reputation for decisiveness, a reputation which he gained when
he was Algeria's economic overlord from 1965 to 1978.
Mr Abdessalam was sacked at the weekend and replaced by the minister of
foreign affairs, Mr Redha Malek, one of the five members of the High State
Council (HCE) which has ruled Algeria since the forced resignation of Mr
Chadli Bendjedid in January 1992.
Mr Abdessalam's dismissal is the direct consequence of his unwillingness to
usher in essential economic reforms and broker an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund. Both are essential if the spiral of economic
decline, one of the chief causes of unrest, is to be reversed.
Despite many brave words, Mr Abdessalam's 'war economy' has left the
country's factories and finances in a more parlous state than a year ago.
His campaign to clear out corruption and stamp out the black market has come
to nil. Ordinary Algerians who believed his promise that their standard of
living would not suffer from economic reforms feel betrayed.
The former prime minister proved only too true to his past. He re-imposed
tight state control on foreign trade and refused to allow the dinar, which
had lost half its value between 1989 and 1991 - the two years during which
Algerian leaders were implementing bold reforms aimed at liberalising their
country's economy - to continue depreciating.
Massive injections of cash into state companies which remain unreformed has
turned a budget surplus equivalent to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product
in 1991 into a deficit of 14.2 per cent this year, and pushed inflation
beyond the 30 per cent mark.
Mr Abdessalam's policies have ruled out any agreement with the IMF. The
one-year standby agreement reached in June 1991 was scuppered in December
that year.
Officials at the IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission privately
bemoaned what they felt was Mr Abdessalam's lack of understanding of
economics. They regretted his suspension of key articles of the Law on
Credit and Money which, in April 1990, opened Algeria to foreign investment
and which, by December 1991, had led 131 foreign companies to sign joint
ventures with planned investments of Dollars 2bn.
The appointment of Mr Malek as prime minister has been welcomed by senior
European and US officials. He is known as an implacable opponent of the
populist Islam propagated by the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
Mr Malek knows that some kind of agreement with the IMF and Algeria's
leading creditors, notably France, is indispensable. His government is
expected to seek a dialogue which would enable Algeria to loosen the noose
of the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt. Servicing that debt absorbs
three-quarters of export earnings.
The new French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, gave public support to the
Algerian leaders in their fight against the FIS earlier this summer, a
reversal of the policy pursued by the former Socialist administration.
Western countries appear to be prepared to turn a blind eye to the abuses of
human rights so long as economic reforms are pursued. The growing violence
in Egypt and the fear of the consequences of FIS propaganda among poor north
African immigrants in France has made French politicians more cautious about
castigating its former colony for being undemocratic. Indeed, Mr Malek has
had some success in convincing US, French and Italian officials that an FIS
victory would not usher in a period of democracy.
Unlike many of his peers, who professed to believe in democratic elections,
Mr Malek never bothered to hide his contempt for what he described as the
'demagoguery' of those, on both sides of the political spectrum, who
professed to build a democracy out of the ruins of a single-party state
overnight. He consistently argued that until the economy was reformed and
the authority of the state vested in competent and cleaner hands, free and
fair elections were a chimera.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Fall in Japan's capital spending seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL spending by Japanese companies is set to fall this year for the
third year running, according to a bank survey published yesterday,
highlighting the continued weak state of the country's economy.
In a survey of 1,544 companies, Nippon Credit Bank found that planned
capital spending for fiscal 1993 was down 3.8 per cent from the level given
in a similar survey in February. This meant planned capital investment for
the fiscal year would be 3 per cent lower than in the previous year. It was
the first time in seven years that the level of planned capital investment
had fallen between February and August, the bank said.
Capital spending planned by manufacturing companies was down by 15.2 per
cent, marking the second double-digit decline in two years. Capital spending
by manufacturing companies had fallen by 18.8 per cent in fiscal 1992.
Nippon Credit Bank also said that although non-manufacturing companies
planned to increase capital spending by 1.5 per cent on the previous year,
if utilities and leasing companies were excluded, planned capital investment
would fall by 7.6 per cent.
Evidence of Japan's economic slump continued to surface. Toyota, Japan's
largest car-maker, said it was temporarily transferring 175 employees to a
group subsidiary. Production at the subsidiary, which makes bodies for
recreational vehicles, one of the most active market sectors, was expected
to grow, while Toyota's own production had been slowing.
Asahi Glass, a leading glass-maker, is closing a car-window-glass factory
because of the slowdown in the domestic motor industry.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Bitter fight under way to succeed Mahathir: The contest to
be No 2
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, is an apparently fit and
very active 68-year-old who shows no sign of retiring. But to judge by the
bubbling cauldron that is Malaysian politics these days, it is as if Dr
Mahathir, prime minister for the past 12 years, is already preparing to go.
A bitter battle is developing over who will succeed Dr Mahathir. In November
the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the country's dominant
political party and main grouping within the ruling Barisan Nasional
(National Front) coalition government, holds elections for party posts.
No one is likely to challenge Dr Mahathir's party leadership. But the
contenders are out for the post of party No 2. The theory is that whoever
emerges as deputy will one day inherit the Mahathir mantle and with it power
and influence over almost every sector of the nation's life.
There are two main candidates for the post, representing very different
strands in modern Malaysia. The present incumbent and deputy prime minister,
Mr Ghafar Babar, is the same age as Dr Mahathir, and is a long-time Umno
stalwart, renowned for his contacts with the rural voters.
Mr Ghafar describes himself as 'just a kampong (village) boy', lays no claim
to great intellectualism but feels that he has earned, through hard work and
loyalty to his leader, the right to succeed Dr Mahathir when the prime
minister eventually retires.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister and Mr Ghafar's opponent in the
contest, is a very different kind of politician. Still only in his mid-40s,
Mr Anwar has had a meteoric rise through party ranks.
Suave and urbane, his conversation peppered with literary and scholastic
references, Mr Anwar is said to represent the Malay baru or new Malay,
modern in outlook, a man capable of carrying through the ambitious Mahathir
vision of making Malaysia a fully industrialised nation by the year 2020.
Mr Anwar, declaring his candidacy yesterday, said he wanted to help make
Umno a party of the 21st century. But to an outsider Malaysian politics
seems very traditional. Politics is segregated along strictly racial lines:
the Malays, who make up just over 50 per cent of the population, join Umno
while other races, mainly Chinese and Indians, have their own parties.
While the Chinese still control a large slice of Malaysia's economic
activity, the Malays, through Umno, are the political masters of the
country.
Umno leaders deny the party is involved in business. But commerce and
politics are closely related in Malaysia. Umno in particular has built
itself up into a considerable business - as well as political - force. The
financial community talks openly of Umno-connected companies and business
people.
Analysts of Kuala Lumpur's thriving stock market look as much at who is in
or out of political favour as they do at company balance sheets in assessing
market performance.
Mr Anwar's opponents say the finance minister has raised a vast monetary war
chest to further his cause: his supporters are widely credited with having
engineered a MDollars 800m (Pounds 210m) management buy-out earlier this
year of the country's biggest newspaper group and TV station. Opponents say
national news is now increasingly favourable to Mr Anwar.
Mr Anwar's supporters are also believed to be linked to a company that has
gained control of a MDollars 3.5bn private power project, the biggest such
scheme in the country.
The finance minister has strongly denied the talk about political
fund-raising and has accused his rivals of spreading malicious gossip.
Dr Mahathir has chosen the role of elder statesman. He has insisted he is
strictly neutral in the contest. But the prime minister has spoken out
against money politics.
'It is the thin end of the wedge,' he said. 'Give a person 10 dollars and
they will want more.'
Dr Mahathir is also concerned about the damage a bruising contest between Mr
Ghafar and Mr Anwar will do to Umno unity. In 1987-88 a party split almost
caused Dr Mahathir to lose power.
Political analysts say a general election is likely early next year, both to
renew Dr Mahathir's mandate and also to heal the political wounds that might
be inflicted in the coming contest.
Malaysia is seen as one of south-east Asia's most politically stable
countries - a key factor in attracting millions of dollars of foreign
investment. Dr Mahathir insists stability will be maintained.
'We (in Umno) are quite rational people. . . we don't have that kind of very
violent antagonism towards each other or total inability to work with each
other' said the prime minister in a recent interview.
That view will be put to the test over the next two months.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Saudis widen political horizons
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMATS yesterday wel-comed the naming of the 60 people who will sit on
Saudi Arabia's new consultative council as the most important political
change in the kingdom since it became a state more than 60 years ago.
King Fahd's weekend announcement, which fulfilled a promise made more than
15 years ago to open out his kingdom's secretive, family-run government, was
welcomed as 'remarkable' in the context of the Gulf's most powerful and
conservative state.
'It's an important step,' said Mr David Gore-Booth, Britain's ambassador in
Riyadh.
The setting up of the Shoura council, as it will be known, will bring Saudi
Arabia in line with other Gulf states, including Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain.
These states have taken steps of varying degrees towards broader political
participation since the Gulf war, partly because of the intense western
scrutiny of their political systems which came with the war.
The new Saudi council will be free to advise and criticise the government
but has no legislative powers.
Its creation falls well short of anything like a shift towards western-style
democracy. Its members are appointed to their four-year terms by the king,
who retains the final say in all policy decisions.
However, its constitution will allow the first institutionalised political
participation for Saudis outside the royal family.
'It represents a realisation that you can no longer run a country which has
had modernity thrust upon it with ancient methods,' said one Gulf analyst.
'It's an implicit dilution of absolute power.'
In a further move to open up the kingdom's closely held government, King
Fahd also announced that all ministerial terms would be limited to four
years, subject to possible extensions. Saudi ministers have hitherto enjoyed
almost indefinite tenure.
The list of council members is a broad and carefully balanced selection of
academics, military men, journalists, doctors, businessmen, deputy
ministers, lawyers, religious scholars and poets.
Few are well known outside the kingdom and many obscure inside it,
reflecting the kingdom's lack of a public political culture.
More than half the new members hold doctorates, many from US or other
western universities. Many observers feel that if not quite pro-western, the
council as a whole is well acquainted with the west. 'We can say that it's
not entirely weighted in the direction of the conservatives,' said one
diplomat.
No date has been set for the first meeting of the new council, which will
convene at least once every two weeks. It will do so in a building in
Riyadh's diplomatic quarter which was completed, along with electronic
voting equipment, in the late 1970s and has awaited a role ever since.

RUSSIA hopes to repay Dollars 1.47bn (Pounds 980m) borrowed from South Korea
by providing the Seoul government with high-tech missiles, fighter jets and
other cold war-era weaponry, a Russian official said yesterday, AP-DJ
reports from Seoul.
Russia's deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, who arrived in Seoul
on Sunday for a four-day visit, said he would offer the proposal to South
Korean officials today.
They have said in the past they would consider such an offer, even if only
to have training equipment similar to that used in North Korea. The former
Soviet Union long was a weapons supplier to North Korea.
Russia is unable to repay the loans or to meet Dollars 58m interest payments
because of economic difficulties, Mr Shokhin said.

A commission of inquiry in South Africa has found that the African National
Congress tortured, mistreated and in some cases killed prisoners detained in
its prison camps outside South Africa in the 1980s. But it stopped short of
blaming senior ANC officials for the abuses, writes Patti Waldmeir in
Johannesburg.
In a report released yesterday, a three-man commission appointed by ANC
president Nelson Mandela echoed criticisms from an earlier internal
commission of inquiry, saying that ANC security officers had beaten,
tortured, detained without trial, and in some cases executed detainees.
But it named only two senior ANC officials and accused them of relatively
minor abuses.
More serious findings were made against members of the ANC's security
branch, and the commission recommends that they be disciplined under the
ANC's internal code of conduct.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Kennedy assassination archive opens: Public given access to
secret files in attempt to quell suspicions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the ultimate treasure trove for historians, journalists, conspiracy
theorists and Kennedy-worshippers: 800,000 pages of documents relating to
the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, released to the public
yesterday.
The huge archive was opened for inspection in Washington nearly 30 years
after Mr Kennedy's death, following a bill passed in Congress last year that
ordered the disclosure of almost all government records on the case.
These include most of the few files which have not yet been published from
the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination under the
chairmanship of former Chief Justice Earl Warren, as well as documents from
congressional committees and 90,000 pages from the Central Intelligence
Agency.
Early finds in the CIA records include a secret internal memorandum
speculating that the Soviet Union had most to gain from the assassination,
although offering no concrete evidence of Soviet involvement.
The Warren Commission's central conclusion, that Mr Kennedy was killed by
Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone, has been backed up by most serious inquiries
since then, with the exception of a 1979 House of Representatives select
committee chaired by Mr Louis Stokes, an Ohio Democrat, which found that a
second gunman probably fired at Mr Kennedy and missed.
Most recently, pathologists and doctors who examined Mr Kennedy's body in
Dallas in 1963 reaffirmed in the Journal of the American Medical Association
their original finding that the president was struck by only two bullets,
one of which caused the head wounds that killed him. Both were fired from
above and behind, they said.
Nevertheless, US public opinion has never accepted this verdict, preferring
a series of theories involving a second assassin, as well as Cuban, Russian,
Mafia or CIA backing for Oswald.
Oswald himself was shot before standing trial.
Even in the 1980s opinion polls showed two thirds of those questioned
believed there was a conspiracy to kill Mr Kennedy, compared with only 13
per cent who believed Oswald acted alone.
Mr Oliver Stone's film JFK last year brought a new intensity to the already
thriving Kennedy conspiracy industry.
The law ordering the opening of the assassination archive came in response
to an upsurge created by the film in public questioning of the Warren
report.
But members of Congress, including Mr Stokes, warn that no matter what is
released it will not be enough to quell public suspicion.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Fishermen agree end to Valdez blockade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALASKA'S Valdez oil terminal opened again yesterday after fishermen agreed
to end a blockade provoked by their complaints that the effects of the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill had devastated their salmon catch.
Mr Bruce Babbitt, US interior secretary, intervened in the dispute on
Sunday, harshly criticising Exxon, the oil giant, for refusing to meet the
fishermen.
He also persuaded the protesters to move their fishing vessels from the
Valdez narrows, where they had prevented at least seven oil tankers from
docking to take on Alaskan crude oil.
The Alyeska pipeline which ends at Valdez handles about a quarter of US
crude oil production.
Mr Babbitt also promised action at a meeting in Anchorage yesterday to clean
up the operation of the Dollars 900m (Pounds 604m) trust fund set up with
Exxon money after the Exxon Valdez disaster.
The fund, administered by federal and Alaskan officials, has been criticised
in a new report from Congress's General Accounting Office, which found that
most of the Dollars 200m it had spent so far had gone to reimburse state and
federal agencies, and Exxon itself, for past clean-up work, and for
administrative and legal expenses.
The GAO said the trust fund had approved projects which 'either do not
appear to be directly linked to the oil spill or appear to duplicate
existing responsibilities of federal and state agencies'.
Congressman George Miller, who commissioned the report, added that 'the
bureaucrats gave top priority to feather-ing their own nests with
reimbursements and gold-plated studies of questionable merit.'
Mr Babbitt promised he would urge the fund's trustees at yesterday's meeting
to devote more money to buying land to protect the rivers where salmon
spawn.
Exxon said no scientific link had been established between this year's low
pink salmon catch and the 11m gallons of oil its tanker spilled into Alaska
waters when it ran aground in 1989.

<TEXT>
HOPES for an early end to Nicaragua's hostage crisis were hit yesterday
after a guerrilla leader issued fresh conditions for the release of 18
government officials, agencies report from Managua.
In a stand-off which reflects the bitter divisions left by the country's
brutal eight-year civil war, armed gangs of the left and right are holding
more than 40 officials, politicians and journalists at two different sites.
A group of former US-backed Contra rebels in the remote northern village of
El Zungano freed 20 of their 38 prisoners late on Sunday after talks with
envoys including an Organisation of American States representative.
Last Thursday the rebels, led by Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal (The
Jackal), seized 38 government officials, soldiers and leftist Sandinista
politicians who had travelled to El Zungano to try to persuade him to lay
down his arms.
He originally demanded the firing of armed forces chief General Humberto
Ortega and presidential chief-of-staff Mr Antonio Lacayo, whom he accuses of
plotting to allow the former governing Sandinistas to continue ruling
Nicaragua despite their 1990 election defeat by President Violeta Chamorro.
On Sunday he settled for a pledge from the government to review a list of
his grievances, only to return to his original demands yesterday.
In Managua, a group of about eight pro-Sandinista gunmen retaliated on
Friday against Mr Talavera's hostage-taking by seizing the headquarters of
the conservative National Opposition Union (UNO) party, taking prisoner
Nicaragua's vice-president Virgilio Godoy and several dozen UNO leaders.
The group freed 16 prisoners at the weekend and two more yesterday. However
they also took about eight journalists hostage on Sunday.

FT  24 AUG 93 / 'Barefoot doctors' wage war on Brazil's other child killers:
Christina Lamb joins a health army on foot, donkey, canoe or bicycle in poor
north-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE brutal killing of eight street children in Rio recently thrust Brazil
into the headlines, but the lives of many more children are being claimed by
a lower-profile killer. Victims of a woeful lack of basic sanitation and
inadequate food, 30,000 infants die each year in the country's impoverished
north-east for want of minimum health care.
While for the most part Brazilian authorities have failed dismally to
provide basic services, one of the country's poorest states is showing that
with the political will it is possible to improve the situation.
In just three years the north-eastern state of Ceara has slashed infant
mortality by a third through a cheap and simple project of door-to-door
basic health assistance.
Its efforts were recognised in May with Unicef's Maurice Pate prize - the
first time the award has gone to a state rather than an institution. Mr Agop
Kayayan, Unicef representative in Brazil, describes the Ceara project as 'a
model not just for Brazil but for the world'.
Every day throughout Ceara an army of health agents sets out by foot,
donkey, canoe or bicycle, wearing white shirts marked with blue crosses and
carrying rucksacks containing scissors, soap and portable scales. Most are
young women, many are semi-literate, but they criss-crossthousands of miles
of scrubland like latter-day missionaries bringing healthcare to people who
have never seen a doctor in their lives.
In the small town of Manguarape, 24-year-old Mariluce Oliveira da Silva is
doing her rounds. Entering a wattle and daub shack where a family of seven
live amid squalor, she reminds the mother to wash the children's hands and
keep their hair and nails clean.
Using a sling scale she weighs the seven-month baby and marks his progress
on a chart. Noticing that it is dangerously near the red warning line for
severe malnutrition, she stresses the need for breast-feeding and explains
how to mix re-hydration salts to cure diarrhoea - the biggest killer of
young children.
The scheme was created in 1988 by Mr Tasso Jereissati, a businessman elected
state governor. Horrified by the infant mortality rate, which was among the
highest in the world at about 100 per 1,000, he ordered a survey which found
48 per cent of the deaths of young children were caused by de-hydration from
diarrhoea. Although the real cause was lack of sanitation, which requires
heavy investment, its effects can be easily cured through oral re-hydration
therapy - a packet of salts costing 10 cents.
Helped by Unicef and under the direction of Mr Carlil Lavor, a hygienist
familiar with the barefoot doctors scheme in China, a programme was set up
to train 3,000 health agents in hygiene, prenatal care, re-hydration
therapy, vaccination and breast-feeding. Each agent attends about 150
families for a monthly salary of Dollars 60 (Pounds 40), reporting every
month to a trained nurse in a municipal centre.
In the first three years infant mortality was reduced by 32 per cent from 95
per 1,000 live births to 65 and Ceara has gone from last place among
Brazilian states in terms of percentage of children vaccinated to first.
Moreover, the scheme provides work in a state where 40 per cent of the
working population are unemployed or under-employed.
The most remarkable thing is that this was carried out in Brazil's third
poorest state and one which was completely bankrupt when Mr Jereissati took
office as well as suffering the harshest drought this century. More than
half the 6.6m population have no sewers or running water and two thirds live
below the poverty line.
But Mr Jereissati points out that the real problem in Brazil is not money.
'Our achievements were far less to do with resources and far more to do with
changing the posture of the administration and involving the community. When
I took office we found vaccines rotting in stores.'
Mr Kayayan says that the Ceara government is probably saving money: 'There
is no comparison between the 30 cents needed to cure an attack of diarrhoea
or Dollars 5-Dollars 10 for a complete set of vaccines and the cost of a
child occupying a hospital bed.'
Although the health agents are paid by the state government, they are chosen
by the communities, a revolutionary idea in a still feudal state. Such a
break with convention made the scheme difficult to implement, Mr Jereissati
says.
'We met lots of resistance from politicians who resented the loss of
patronage and thus control over the electorate.' One mayor even greeted the
co-ordinators with a revolver.
To give the idea credibility, they involved the church, university and
paediatric society on the basis that if the priest and the doctor say it is
good, it must be.
Even so, some of the local population were unhappy at intruders coming into
their houses and health workers felt uncomfortable lecturing about hygiene
when families obviously had no food in the house.
But Nurse Madalena Pinhedo, who co-ordinates a team of 80 agents in
Manguarape, says: 'It's possible even when people are on very low income to
do a lot because they have very little knowledge about such basic things as
brushing teeth, keeping hair clean, not leaving faeces on the ground and
which foods are most nutritious.'
Success has bred acceptance and the new governor, Mr Ciro Gomes, a political
ally of Mr Jereissati, has expanded the scheme to 7,300 agents attending 4m
people.
Describing them as 'Ceara's guardian angels', he says their value became
clear during the recent cholera epidemic as they were able to catch cases
early and stop the disease spreading.
The greatest accolade, perhaps, is that governors from three other
north-eastern states have asked Unicef to help them set up the same scheme.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA yesterday accused Britain of trying to block the sale of advanced
US tactical radar for its air force, but predicted that the effort by its
former foe would fail, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
'The pressure from Britain is there, but we think it is being overcome,' Mr
Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, told a radio interviewer. 'We
hope it will not succeed.'
He was commenting on a report in the daily Clarin which said London was
pressing Washington to ban the sale of advanced radar to equip three dozen
ageing Skyhawk fighter aircraft.
Mr Oscar Camilion, the defence minister, made similar charges in a separate
radio interview, blaming London for what he described as US reluctance to
allow Argentina to purchase the radar together with the aircraft.
'The objections are coming from the US State Department. . . this is
apparently due to British pressure,' he said.
The British embassy in Buenos Aires declined to comment.
Argentina is buying the Skyhawks from the US to replenish its forces,
decimated during the 1982 conflict with Britain over the Falkland islands.
The two countries re-established full diplomatic links in 1990. Mr Douglas
Hurd, UK foreign secretary, visited Buenos Aires in January and his
counterpart Mr Guido di Tella is due in London later this year.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Brazilians use the Beetle for trip into past

THE FILM Back to the Future relied on an out-dated De Lorean sports car for
its trips through time, but Brazil yesterday started its own journey into
the past with the relaunch of the Volkswagen Beetle, out of production since
1986.
The relaunch followed agreement in February between President Itamar Franco
and Autolatina, the joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford which is
Brazil's biggest vehicle maker.
The president wanted lower-priced, 'popular' cars, while Autolatina saw the
chance for a publicity coup and a way to extract tax concessions from the
government.
The car was launched at a ceremony yesterday in Autolatina's largest
Brazilian factory in Sao Paulo. It was attended by the president, several
ministers and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's director of
production.
The Beetle's popularity in Brazil is partly sentimental. It was the first
car to become affordable to the middle classes in the 1960s. It can also
handle the country's battered roads and is easy to repair.
The 'Fusca', as the Beetle is known in Brazil, has a newly-installed
catalytic converter and electronic ignition. Otherwise it is almost
identical to the old model which ceased production seven years ago.
The relaunch has fired mixed emotions. Some businessmen have dismissed it as
an unwelcome irrelevance when the Brazilian car industry is trying to
upgrade.
The industry, which includes Fiat and General Motors, is expected this year
to regain from Mexico its position at the top of the Latin American league.
Autolatina's unions are sceptical of the relaunch, even though it will
create about 8,000 jobs. They claim Autolatina's total investment of Dollars
30m (Pounds 20m) is small and the car's estimated sale price of Dollars
7,200 puts it out of reach of most Brazilians.
One union leader even grumbled that, given the money, he would rather buy a
Gol, another of Volkswagen's Brazilian models.

UNITED Nations officials yesterday were trying to persuade besieging Bosnian
Croat forces to let through convoys carrying food to tens of thousands of
Moslems trapped in Mostar, in southwestern Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the Bosnian Croat army, has prevented
relief supplies reaching some 55,000 people in the east of the city who have
little food and water. Eleven lorries were waiting yesterday for HVO
clearance to deliver 120 tonnes of food.
Conditions in the area were described as 'alarming' by Miss Lyndall Sachs of
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, who added that people could starve
within five days.
In order to gain access to the heavily damaged eastern part of Mostar,
relief officials said they would have to give an equal amount of aid to the
mainly Croat inhabitants of the western side of the city.
One HVO official told BBC Radio that UN aid would be allowed into the town
tomorrow, but only if Moslems laid down their arms and let aid reach some
190,000 Croats cut off in central Bosnia.
Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday appealed in a letter to the
UN Security Council for urgent help in order to avert a 'true catastrophe'
in Mostar.
His parliament was due to meet on Friday to consider a compromise plan to
divide Bosnia put forward by the international mediators Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg. In an apparent sign that parliament might reject the
proposal, Radio Sarajevo yesterday broadcast statements from officials of
several Bosnian towns opposing it. Mr Izetbegovic has already said he could
not 'recommend' acceptance.
For their part, Bosnia's Croat and Serb leaders have welcomed the proposal,
calling it a compromise which could end the 17-month war. Under the plan
Serbs would get about 54 per cent of Bosnia, Croats about 17.5 per cent,
while 28 per cent would be reserved for the Moslems. The latter were the
biggest pre-war ethnic group, comprising 44 per cent of the 4.35m
population.
Reporting to the Security Council yesterday, Mr Stoltenberg warned that
without a negotiated settlement soon the war would intensify and expand
'with severe consequences'. Next winter, he said 'could be an utter
nightmare'.
In Zagreb, site of the UN headquarters in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Kofi
Annan, UN undersecretary for peacekeeping operations, yesterday met
officials of countries which have supplied peacekeeping troops.
A UN spokesman there refused to say whether Mr Annan was seeking commitments
to increase contributions if a settlement were agreed in Bosnia. Mr
Stoltenberg has said the plan would require about 40,000 troops.
In the third such resignation this month, a US State Department specialist
on eastern Europe resigned yesterday, saying he could not carry out US
policy on the former Yugoslavia, Reuter reports from Washington.

FT  24 AUG 93 / French suspend overnight rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday pushed interest rates nearer to levels that
prevailed before the recent currency crisis by reducing the cost of lending
wholesale cash overnight for the fifth time in two weeks.
The cut in the central bank's 24-hour rate, from 8.25 per cent to 7.75 per
cent, was accompanied by a large injection of cash in the French money
market. Later, the 24-hour rate was suspended, in a move which some analysts
saw as a further indication that monetary policy was being eased.
These moves followed several trading days which have seen the French franc
appreciate sharply against the D-Mark inside the more relaxed European
exchange rate mechanism.
The cut in French rates was accompanied by indications that central banks in
the ERM may be relaxing the high interest rate policy which has kept their
currencies strong against the D-Mark.
The Danish central bank yesterday cut its 14-day certificate of deposit rate
by half a percentage point to 10.5 per cent, its first easing of monetary
policy since the ERM bands were widened.
Both the peseta and the escudo depreciated as dealers took the view that
their central banks could cut interest rates ahead of this week's Bundesbank
council meeting, the first since the summer recess.
Officials at the Bank of France said the suspension of the 24-hour rate,
introduced at the end of last month to control liquidity and support the
French franc within the ERM, was a technical move. It reflected increased
liquidity in the money market and the fall of short-term money market rates
to near pre-crisis levels of 7.25 per cent.
But economists said the central bank also wanted to signal that the
pressures facing the currency had eased.
The franc took the move in its stride, closing a little weaker at FFr3.485,
against FFr3.478.
Most currency analysts believed it remained vulnerable. They said the
foreign exchange markets were expecting cuts in the intervention rate, which
provides a floor for money market rates and stands at 6.75 per cent, and the
5-10 day borrowing rate, which stands at 10 per cent.
The timing of reductions in French interest rates will depend on the
Bundesbank's council meeting. If it decides on a cut in German rates this
would allow France to trim its intervention rate, perhaps by as early as
next Monday. However, unchanged German rates could lead to renewed pressures
on the franc.
Investors are eager for further rate cuts in France to help revive the
economy and are not particularly concerned with any impact on inflation. The
inflation figures for July, released yesterday by Insee, the national
statistics institute, supported this view. The figures confirmed that
consumer prices rose by just 0.1 per cent in July, compared with June, and
that annualised inflation at the end of last month was down to 2.1 per cent.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Kohl and Scharping feed rumour mill: Press speculates on
coalition after German polls
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl and Mr Rudolf Scharping, recently-elected leader of
Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD), met behind closed doors
yesterday for wide-ranging talks, fuelling press speculation that they will
be forced to form a grand coalition after next year's elections.
Both political leaders have flatly rejected the idea, each insisting that he
is campaigning for outright victory, but the very fact that they are
prepared to meet and talk privately has stoked the overheated rumour mill in
Bonn.
The meeting underlines the fact that both men belong firmly in Germany's
tradition of consensual politics, where cross-party compromises are the
regular answer to resolving their conflicts. It also confirms Mr Scharping's
style as the new opposition leader, in which he is determined to demonstrate
that his party is capable of becoming an alternative government.
The talks, the first since Mr Scharping was elected SPD party leader in
June, lasted 90 minutes and when he emerged Mr Scharping said they covered
'everything currently on the political agenda'.
They were set to discuss the current state of the German economy, and how to
stem the rapid rise in unemployment and revive ailing east German
manufacturing industry. In spite of the fact that both signed the
cross-party solidarity pact last March on financing unification, both are
now keen to stress their different economic policies.
There is room for manoeuvre on the issue of German participation in UN
peacekeeping exercises. Mr Scharping is clearly attempting to push his
party, with a strong anti-military, pacifist wing, into permitting wider
international participation for the Bundeswehr.
The SPD and Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats are condemned to reach compromises
on any issues which require changes in Germany's strict constitution - such
as privatisation of state companies, including Deutsche Telekom and the
railways. They also have to negotiate on issues which require the approval
of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, where the SPD has an
effective majority.
Mr Kohl therefore needs Mr Scharping's support to gain approval for his
entire package of budget cuts, though most can be passed by the Bundestag,
the lower house, alone. He also needs support for plans to launch a new
social security system to pay for residential care for the old and
handicapped: the government's current project to finance it by cancelling
paid sick leave for workers has been furiously opposed by the unions.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, who
would be excluded from any grand coalition, said he would meet Mr Scharping
on Friday.

FT  24 AUG 93 / VW pushes Bonn on row: New moves in 'spy' case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, yesterday stepped up his attempt to
draw the Bonn government into the group's clash with Adam Opel, General
Motors' German subsidiary.
He is understood to have telephoned Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister,
for a 'continuation' of face-to-face talks held in Berlin last Friday.
Although the contents of last week's meetings were secret - the minister met
Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, on Tuesday - Mr Rexrodt said at the weekend
he was 'optimistic' he could tone down the war of words.
He appears to have accepted the role of mediator despite his initial claims
that that he wanted only to gather information.
While there are clear dangers for a politician becoming involved in a
potentially explosive legal issue, Mr Rexrodt is anxious that the
inter-company conflict does not blow up into a clash between Washington and
Bonn.
The minister's 'optimism' suggests Mr Piech and his colleagues are prepared
 -at a price - to apologise publicly for charges that Opel was acting as
agent provocateur in a US-inspired 'war' against its domestic rival, and
suggestions that it could have planted evidence with the aim of
incriminating its employees.
In return Mr Piech is expected to demand that Opel officials stop all press
communications on their suspicions and also call a halt to the current
criminal investigations against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW
production director, and three of his associates.
VW stopped commenting on the theft and industrial espionage probe more than
a week ago, when it refused even to deny new media allegations that 11 of
its employees transferred confidential Opel data in Volkswagen computers.
General Motors officials have persistently refused to talk peacefully while
VW failed to withdraw its charges, stressing that their legal complaints had
made no mention of VW itself.

FT  24 AUG 93 / French Privatisation: France gets its cake, and eats it -
Limiting and attracting foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Pamela Harriman, the new US ambassador to France, is an unashamed
Francophile, but last month she aired a rare grievance against the French
government by complaining about the restrictions on foreign investment in
its privatisation programme.
The object of Mrs Harriman's criticism was the amendment to the government's
privatisation bill to limit investors outside the European Community to a
maximum of 20 per cent of the shares in privatised companies.
The US lobby argued that the 20 per cent rule was a protectionist measure
reminiscent of the traditional constraints on foreign investors in the
French financial markets.
The amendment survived and is now enshrined in the legislation which will
shape the new privatisation programme. The 20 per cent rule is really an
irrelevance, given that it only applies at the time of the original issue
and non-EC investors will then be free to buy shares on the open market.
However, the incident serves as an apt illustration of France's ambivalent
attitude to privatisation. The French are undoubtedly keen to attract
investment from foreigners and to enhance Paris's status as an international
financial centre.
Yet they are still anxious to protect privatised companies from the rigours
of life in the private sector, particularly from the threat of 'foreign
predators', whether they are from inside or outside the Community.
One of the main achievements of the last centre-right government's 1986-1987
privatisation drive was its success at attracting foreign investment. Until
then it had been difficult for foreign investors to buy shares in France
given that so many large companies were privately-owned or state-controlled.
The privatisations gave investors away into the Paris market at a time when
the UK pension funds were pursuing an aggressive policy of international
investment. The proportion of French shares in foreign hands has since
increased steadily, from 21 per cent to 28 per cent in the past two years
alone, according to the Bank of France. At first glance it looks as though
it might be more difficult for the French to attract foreign investment in
the new round of privatisations.
First, the financial prospects for French companies are more precarious than
they were in the buoyant mid-1980s. At the same time, the privatisation
market is more competitive, with an estimated Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) of
state shares currently scheduled to come on to the market in Europe.
Second, whereas foreign investors needed to build up French portfolios in
the mid-1980s, they now have substantial French holdings. Warburg Securities
estimates that the Paris Bourse represents 23 per cent of the value of all
continental Europe equities, but 26 per cent of the average continental
portfolio.
However, most brokers and bankers are confident that foreign investors will
be willing to increase their commitment to France in this autumn's sales.
'French stocks are not cheap at the moment and many European investors,
particularly in the UK, are already over-weight in France, but there is
still strong interest in many of the companies scheduled for sale,' said Mr
David Harrington, equity strategist at James Capel in Paris.
Interest from the US is also likely to be high given that many institutions
are in the throes of 'internationalising' their portfolios, just as their UK
counterparts did during the last privatisation drive.
There are even hopes of a strong response from Japan.
'Japanese investors are interested in France, interested in privatisation
and, at this time in the cycle, it is a good time to buy,' said Mr Alain
Cellier, chief executive of Nomura in France. 'There is only one caveat -
the strength of the yen.'
The recent fall of the franc and the rise of the Paris stock market - the
CAC 40 Index ended last week at a record 2,149.83 - should make French
equities seem even more appealing. It might also lessen the risk of foreign
investors switching cash from existing French holdings into privatisation
stocks by persuading them to bring new money into France.
However, this influx of foreign funds does not seem likely to trigger the
tidal wave of takeover bids that the traditionalists in French finance fear.
The 20 per cent rule is probably the least effective of the government's
defensive ploys. The others include plans to assemble networks of
sympathetic noyaux durs, 'hard core' investors, to support the
newly-privatised companies and to introduce 'golden shares' to some stocks,
thereby enabling the state to block takeovers indefinitely.
The experience of the last batch of French privatisations suggests that such
measures may not be necessary. The only one of the mid-1980s privatisations
to have come under attack was the bank Societe Generale, in an unsuccessful
raid mounted in 1988 by Mr Georges Pebereau, the French financier.

THE WAR of words between Russia and Lithuania grew more heated yesterday,
after Moscow abruptly broke off talks last week and suspended its troop
pull-out from the Baltic state.
President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman warned Lithuania against seeking to
apply international pressure on Russia to stick to an earlier agreement to
withdraw its troops by the end of the month.
'The striving to inflict pressure through a third country can only cause a
negative reaction,' Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov was quoted as saying by Interfax
news agency.
Lithuania appealed for international help after the Russian foreign ministry
issued a surprisingly harsh statement telling Lithuania it no longer
considered itself bound to complete a troop pull-out by August 31. Russia
said it would withdraw over a period which was 'convenient to it' and which
Lithuania would be informed of in due course.
The statement accused Lithuania of blocking an agreement and hinted it was
annoyed by Lithuanian demands for compensation for damage done by five
decades of Soviet occupation.
'Democratic Russia is not responsible for the totalitarian repression of
Stalinism. It suffered itself,' Mr Kostikov said.
While only 2,500 Russian soldiers are left in Lithuania, mainly support
staff based in the western port city of Klaipeda, Lithuanian officials said
they feared Russia might bring back more troops to strengthen its position.
'We are prepared for the worst,' said Mr Justas Paleckis, an adviser to
President Algirdas Brazauskas.
The left-leaning Lithuanian government, surprised by the Russian move, had
refrained from joining in the sharp criticism made by the nationalistic
opposition, led by Mr Vytautas Landsbergis.
Mr Brazauskas, who won February's presidential elections promising to
maintain good relations with Russia, appealed for calm in a televised speech
on Sunday night.
He also expressed a desire to compromise, without condemning the Russian
step.

outcome

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S minority Labour government is planning to introduce a package of
measures, valued at an estimated NKr600m (Pounds 55m), in an attempt to
create jobs, boost the competitiveness of the country's industry and
increase non-oil exports.
The extra funds will be included in the 1994 budget, which is due to be
presented on October 13 if the present government retains power after the
general election on September 13. Mr Finn Kristensen, the industry and
energy minister, made the announcement during a campaign speech in Molde on
the west coast of Norway, an area which has been particularly hard hit in
recent years by unemployment and company bankruptcies.
Norway's unemployment rate is currently running at a record 8 per cent,
including those on government job training schemes. Along with proposed
membership of the European Community, unemployment is the single biggest
issue in the election campaign.
Key measures in the package include:
Abolition of corporate electricity taxes, saving industry an estimated
NKr265m annually. Last December the government abolished the tax for
energy-intensive industries and the pulp and paper sector, whose
competitiveness had been eroded after Sweden and Finland had in effect
devalued their currencies.
NKr176m for measures to help industry increase exports and enter rapidly
expanding Asian markets.
NKr100m to finance development projects in third world countries in which
Norwegian companies will participate. Of this total, about NKr40m will be in
export credits to sell domestic goods and services.
Other funds will be allocated to research and development contracts in the
private and public sectors and education. A project called 'Invest in
Norway' will promote the benefits of establishing operations in Norway.

THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, and the Georgian leader, Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, agreed yesterday to sign a comprehensive treaty restoring
peace in war-torn Abkhazia, agencies reported, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Shevardnadze told the Itar-Tass agency that the friendship and
co-operation agreement between the two former Soviet republics would be
signed in September in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after a final round of
talks.
'Both of us have expressed satisfaction with the first steps towards a
ceasefire and the terms for a final settlement of the conflict,' the agency
quoted Mr Shevardnadze as saying. The two leaders also discussed ways of
helping about 140,000 refugees, who fled the breakaway Abkhaz region over
the last 12 months, to return home safely, it said.
Mr Shevardnadze said repatriation of refugees was 'perhaps the most acute
problem' after last month's ceasefire in the conflict. He added that the
future Georgian state would be determined by a new constitution. Russia,
which has strategic interests in the Transcaucasus, helped to mediate the
peace deal between Georgia and Abkhazia.

POLAND'S sovereignty could be endangered by a proposed plan that would
supply Russian natural gas to the country along an east-west pipeline, Mr
Jan Olszewski, a former prime minister, warned yesterday.
He was speaking on the eve of a two-day visit to Poland by the Russian
president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, during which an agreement to build the pipeline
is to be signed.
Mr Olszewski, whose right-wing Coalition for the Republic is one of more
than a dozen political groups contesting parliamentary elections on
September 19, alleged that the pipeline would 'nullify chances of obtaining
gas from other sources such as the North Sea'. Russia currently exports
6.5bn cubic metres a year of natural gas to Poland. The pipeline would carry
67bn cubic metres a year 4,000km from the the Arctic Circle to western
Europe.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Brussels to probe service monopolies at airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is investigating complaints from Europe's leading
airlines against monopolies providing ground-handling services at airports
in Milan, Frankfurt and across Spain.
The complaints, filed by Air France, Alitalia, British Airways, KLM,
Lufthansa, SAS and Sabena, could induce Brussels to bring forward
deregulation proposals for such services as airport baggage handling and
refuelling, analogous to the legislation liberalising air transport
introduced in the past six years.
The airlines complain that at a time of unprecedented losses and growing
competition as a result of the EC's 'open skies' policies, they are subject
to high handling costs on the ground, at airports which operate monopolies.
'Liberalisation in the air should be followed by liberalisation on the
ground,' a statement from KLM said yesterday.
The European Commission would only confirm yesterday that it was
investigating three complaints it had received in the last month. Industry
sources said there had been more than a dozen complaints.
KLM said that the Italian, German and Spanish airports cited in the EC
action had attracted the most complaints from European airlines. But there
were also other airports in Europe where competition in ground-handling was
non-existent or extremely limited, a KLM spokesman said.
He declined to name other airports but said he that if all European airports
charged the same rates as Schiphol in Amsterdam, then KLM would save roughly
Fl 25m (Pounds 8.7m) a year in ground-handling charges. These charges at
airports where a monopoly is in force can be 50 per cent higher than at
airports which allow a choice of services, the Dutch carrier said.
In the cases of Frankfurt, Milan and the Spanish airports, KLM is allowed to
have KLM personnel behind the check-in counters, but it is restricted in how
it deploys its own staff.
Ground-handling includes not only passenger check-in but also cargo handling
and aircraft refuelling.
A spokesman for the European Commission said Brussels expected a response to
the complaints from the handling companies in the next three to four weeks.
Officials refused to comment on the likelihood of any action to dilute the
monopolies.
But EC diplomats remarked that at a time when Brussels was enforcing
competition on hard-pressed airlines, and cracking down on state aid to flag
carriers, it would be hard for the Commission to resist their demands for
more competition in ground services.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Azeris lose key town

<TEXT>
AZERI troops yesterday pulled out of a key town near the Iranian border
yesterday in another victory for Armenian forces from the disputed enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Spokesmen for both the Azerbaijan Defence Ministry and the Nagorno-Karabakh
administration said the defenders withdrew overnight from Fuzuli, a town of
40,000 people under siege for days by Armenians occupying the hills on three
sides. The latest victory brought the Armenians closer to cutting off the
entire south-western corner of Azerbaijan, home to some 200,000 people, and
risked angering neighbouring Iran.
The Iranian border is just 25km from Fuzuli and the fighting has sent tens
of thousands of refugees fleeing towards it. Iran denounced the Armenian
offensive last week, saying it believed in the territorial integrity of
Azerbaijan.
Fuzuli is the third big town just outside Nagorno-Karabakh seized by the
Armenians in recent weeks, after Agdam to the east and Cebrayil further to
the south-west. The Azeris say they recaptured Cebrayil at the weekend.
The Armenians, whose military advances have fuelled political turmoil in
Azerbaijan, say they have to drive back the Azeri troops to protect Karabakh
from shelling. The Azeri Defence Ministry said the Armenians had entered
Fuzuli after the withdrawal. But a spokesman for the Nagorno- Karabakh
administration said its forces were holding back. The Karabakh spokesman
said Azeri military aircraft had bombed villages in the Martuni and Gadrut
districts of Karabakh overnight, killing five civilians and wounding 17.
An Azeri Defence Ministry spokesman denied the report. 'This is false
information,' he said. 'The Armenians report Azeri air-raids while taking
Azeri towns.' Conflicting reports of the fighting have been a notable
characteristic of the five-year-old conflict, which has taken several
thousand lives.
Armenia officially denies taking part in the war, although it supplies
diplomatic support for the enclave's claim to independence and the Karabakh
Armenians obtain arms andvolunteer soldiers from Armenia.

FT  24 AUG 93 / S African jobless figure reaches 46% says central bank

SOUTH AFRICA'S four year recession has left nearly half the economically
active population without work in the formal economy, according to the
annual economic report of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank),
published yesterday.
The Reserve Bank said 46 per cent of the labour force were either unemployed
or involved in the 'informal sector', which involves very low-paid
activities such as street hawking.
It was the first accurate official estimate of national unemployment, which
the Reserve Bank said had risen from 39 per cent in 1988. Private sector
economists say previous official figures underestimated unemployment and
underemployment.
Per capita income figures have also suffered, with annualised income per
capita, at R3,200 (Pounds 630) in 1985 prices, no better than the level
reached in 1971. GNP per capita in the second quarter of this year was 13.5
per cent lower in real terms than when it peaked in 1988.
After having declined consistently since the fourth quarter of 1989,
economic output rose sharply in the first half of 1993, leading the Reserve
Bank to conclude that economic activity had finally levelled off. This did
not, however, indicate the resumption of significant growth, despite the
fact that GDP grew by 5.1 per cent in the second quarter and 1.4 per cent in
the first quarter.
The improvement was attributable almost entirely to increased agricultural
production, with non-agricultural sectors stagnant in the first half of the
year. Business cycle indicators were 'not yet showing any clear signs of an
imminent upturn in economic activity', the bank said.
The bank noted that labour productivity in the non-agricultural sectors had
increased at a rate substantially higher than in the past; however this
reflected less a strong commitment to work than a more rapid rate of
retrenchments. Growth in productivity continued to fall below pay growth, so
real unit labour costs continued to increase.
But inflation appeared to be coming under control, with the consumer price
index falling from 16.8 per cent in October 1991 to 10 per cent in June
1993, despite a 4 percentage point rise in value added tax in April.
The bank also listed factors which could lead to improved economic
conditions for the rest of this year and next year, including a gradual
recovery in the world's main industrial economies, the impact of several
large domestic investment projects and the low level of inventories which
could be expected to lead to restocking.

FT  24 AUG 93 / BNF set to win go-ahead for Thorp uranium test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pollution inspectorate is likely to tell British Nuclear Fuels within
days that it can begin testing its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant
with uranium.
Greenpeace, the pressure group, has opposed the start of testing on the
grounds that it prejudges the government's decision on whether to allow the
Pounds 2.8bn plant in west Cumbria to start operation. Greenpeace said
yesterday: 'If the inspectorate gives permission for testing, then we will
go to court and apply for leave for a judicial review.'
BNF originally expected Thorp, which will recycle used nuclear fuel, to
receive authorisation at the start of this year. Opposition from politicians
and environmentalists, however, has led the government to hold a second
public consultation on the plant's future, delaying a decision until the end
of the year.
The inspectorate announced on July 22 that it was 'minded' to allow testing
to begin on the condition that BNF paid for decommissioning any contaminated
equipment if it did not get the go-ahead for the plant.
Since then, the inspectorate has received about 140 responses to its
statement, divided roughly equally between those in favour of testing and
those opposing it.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Investment firms face tougher EC rules on capital: Smaller
financial advisers and fund managers most affected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS OF British investment firms may be forced either to raise more
capital or to change their business activities because of a European
Community directive set to take effect at the end of 1995.
The directive will impose much tougher rules on many smaller firms, and
regulatory officials fear that some may find themselves undercapitalised by
EC standards.
For the first time, UK investment firms will be required to hold an initial
amount of capital, ranging from Pounds 39,000 to Pounds 560,000, depending
on the nature of the business.
The rules are a prelude to the European 'passport' which firms will be able
to hold from December 31 1995 in order to conduct cross-border activities.
This week the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog,
and the self-regulatory bodies which oversee the industry directly are
writing to member firms to explain the requirements and to seek details
about their capital position.
The SIB points out to firms that they must comply with the directive to
remain in business, and warns that it 'is not a consultative document'.
The regulators are worried that some firms may ignore the directive because
they do not intend to seek business outside Britain. An official of the
Securities and Futures Authority, which regulates stockbrokers, said:
'Either you are in this industry or you are out. You do not have to be
opening offices in Frankfurt or Paris to be affected.'
The UK has vigorously urged that the EC adopt capital requirements closer to
its own over the five years that the directive has been debated in Brussels.
However, the EC has been under pressure, particularly from France and
Germany where investment business is largely conducted by banks, to set high
minimum capital requirements.
As well as the rules on initial capital, firms will also have to have enough
to cover their fixed overheads for 13 weeks and to cover risks associated
with their trading position. While large securities firms must now meet
broadly equivalent standards under UK rules for these categories of capital,
smaller financial advisers and fund managers have lower requirements. It is
this type of firm which is likely to be most affected by the directive.
'There will be more firms which have to lock up more capital than they do
now,' said an official at Imro, the self-regulatory body for fund managers.
'Initial capital is the nasty shock.'
Meanwhile, the Treasury is being lobbied by the investment industry to
interpret the Brussels directive liberally.
But even with a liberal interpretation of the directive, officials at the
self-regulatory bodies believe that a significant minority of firms may not
meet the standards. Those which think they may not are being invited in the
letter to apply for 'grandfathering' - under which they can be eased into
the new regime.

FT  24 AUG 93 / BAe deal may be saved by loan guarantees: Taiwan Treasury
could underwrite Pounds 250m venture

TAIWAN may guarantee loans as part of a package to save a Pounds 250m joint
venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation.
Mr Yang Shih-chien, deputy minister of economic affairs, said yesterday that
he did not rule out the Treasury making loan guarantees if the two sides
failed to agree on financing the deal.
He was speaking after 16 hours of talks in Taipei between Taiwanese
officials and Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, failed to settle disagreements
on financing and technology transfer.
Mr Cahill and his team of four senior executives will continue their attempt
to rescue the deal this morning.
Both sides remained optimistic that a deal would be concluded even if talks
spilled into a third day.
The Avro joint venture is central to Mr Cahill's strategy to improve BAe
profitability. The RJ series of regional aircraft, which would be built
partly in Taiwan under the joint venture, loses money for the company.
BAe said proposals it had received from Mr Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of the
Chiao Tung Bank, the Taiwanese state-owned bank, 'were positive'. The Chiao
Tung Bank leads a banking consortium that is due to provide all the initial
working capital for Avro. Some members of the consortium want stronger
guarantees that technology, design and manufacturing skills will be
transferred to Taiwan.
The original joint venture contract signed in January 'was rather loose,' Mr
Yang, who has been closely associated with the proposal, said yesterday.
The banks also want assurances over the status of assets BAe is putting into
the joint venture company - land, plant and machinery in the UK - as
collateral.
Taiwanese law prevents a bank from making unsecured loans to a company in
which it has more than a 3 per cent stake. This threshold is breached by the
Chiao Tung Bank, which owns significantly more than this.
Financial specialists with the Chiao Tung Bank were at the centre of the
talks in Taipei which lasted until almost midnight.
In a further step to reassure the banks yesterday, the government drafted an
official letter stating its commitment to Avro, after the banks indicated
the government's earlier verbal support was insufficient.

FT  24 AUG 93 / Tomkins' US strategist receives Dollars 15m reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD CARR, the man who fashioned a crucial US expansion for Tomkins,
the UK-based conglomerate, has received Dollars 15.1m (Pounds 10m) for his
efforts. The US move probably secured Tomkins' growth as one of Britain's
largest companies.
The payment, modest by the standards of many US style incentive packages, is
believed to be one of the largest made to a working British director.
Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chief executive, said that without the three US
acquisitions made by Mr Carr, Tomkins would not have survived the recent
recession in the UK.
Mr Carr, who remains international mergers and acquisitions director,
received the payment in March in accordance with a 1987 agreement set up
when Tomkins was seeking to expand through acquisition but was not prepared
to start a US office.
Beating a path first trodden 14 years earlier by Lord White, who led the
successful US acquisition programme for Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate,
Mr Carr set up a one-man office in a New York apartment in 1987 to find
Tomkins potential targets.
But unlike Lord White, who was employed by Hanson when he crossed the
Atlantic, Mr Carr was not employed by Mr Hutchings and was required to
invest Dollars 160,000 of his own money, which he would have lost had the
acquisitions failed.
Mr Carr would not comment yesterday, leaving Mr Hutchings to field
questions. He said: 'We knew nothing about America and we had no contacts. I
wanted to incentivise him but put him on risk. I was not prepared to put
someone there and find three years later we had not made an acquisition.'
Mr Hutchings said Mr Carr 'had a lot of downside and we had no downside'.
Mr Carr only joined Tomkins' executive team after he made the first
acquisition in June 1987, the Dollars 113m purchase of Smith &amp; Wesson, the
handgun manufacturer, and the conglomerate set up a US office.
Tomkins then acquired Murray Ohio for Dollars 228m in August 1988 and
Philips Industries for Dollars 550m two years later.
Mr Carr's 1987 agreement stated that he would be entitled to an interest of
10 per cent 'in the growth of the assessed value of businesses he identified
which Tomkins purchased', according to the Tomkins annual report published
yesterday.
These three US businesses generated sales of Dollars 1.72bn and earnings of
Dollars 75.2m in the year to May 1992, entitling Mr Carr to the Dollars
15.1m payment.
Mr Hutchings denied the decision to buy out Mr Carr's interest suggested
Tomkins would make its next acquisition in the US. Tomkins is currently
digesting last year's Pounds 935m acquisition of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
milling and baking group.

THE president of Togo's electoral commission told foreign observers
yesterday that presidential elections had to go ahead on Wednesday, Reuter
reports from Lome.
The date of August 25 was 'unalterable', Mr Gaba Sipohon Koue told election
observers.
Incumbent President Gnassingbe Eyadema said earlier, at an election rally in
the south of Togo, that he had no intention of changing the election date.
The four opposition nominees on the electoral commission have suspended
their participation, but the four nominated by President Eyadema's party and
the president still form a working majority. Mr Koue's remarks were an
apparent climbdown from the committee's request on Saturday to have the vote
postponed by four days.
The opposition members of the committee withdrew after two main opposition
candidates stopped campaigning, saying they wanted the vote put off to give
time for electoral lists to be revised and new voting cards issued.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Sharp drop in growth for Mexican GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO's gross domestic product grew by just 0.3 per cent in the second
quarter, the smallest such increase since President Carlos Salinas took
office in December 1988.
The growth was much slower than expected, and well below the first quarter
increase of 2.4 per cent. The poor performance makes it almost certain that
economic growth for the year will fall significantly short of the
government's target of 2.7 per cent.
'The situation is much more acute than we expected,' says Mr Rogelio Ramirez
de la O, head of the economic consultancy Ecanal.
'This could lead to a whole reassesment of economic policy, with an increase
in government spending likely.'
The government's budget surplus, high real interest rates of around 8 per
cent, and continued real appreciation of the exchange rate helped to squeeze
domestic demand and industry in the second quarter.
The austere economic policy has been attacked by many in the private and
labour sector, and some members of Mexico's governing party are nervous that
it might hurt their chances in next year's presidential election.
For the first half, overall growth was 1.3 per cent. The industrial sector
gained 1.2 per cent, thanks mainly to a 5.2 per cent increase in
construction. Manufacturing grew by just 0.3 per cent. The agricultural
sector shrank by 1.5 per cent, and services climbed by 1.9 per cent.
The low growth helped improve trade balance in the first half of the year to
Dollars 6.9bn, 5.9 per cent less than the first half last year.
Exports climbed to Dollars 24.8bn, 11.9 per cent more than the first half
last year, while imports reached Dollars 31.7bn, an increase of 7.4 per
cent.
The deficit in June was Dollars 1.185bn, 17 per cent less than in the same
month last year. While it came at a cost of low economic growth, the steady
reduction in the trade deficit has eased pressure on the Mexican peso, which
is well within its permitted band of flotation against the US dollar.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Moscow keeps Baltics guessing on troop pullout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VILNIUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S sputtering troop withdrawal from the three Baltic states has turned
into a curious political game.
Last week, for example, Russia stopped the pullout from Lithuania to protest
against Lithuanian demands for reparations - less than two weeks before the
planned first complete withdrawal from a former Soviet republic. And
yesterday Moscow tersely told Vilnius it was breaking the agreement to be
out by August 31.
'The withdrawal will take place according to the norms of international law,
but now over a period which the Lithuanian side will be informed about,' a
Foreign Ministry statement said.
Their quarrel stems from Lithuanian demands for Dollars 143bn to cover
damages for 50 years of Soviet rule - unrecoverable financially but, for the
Lithuanians, an important admission of occupation by Russia. Russia refuses
to be held responsible, financially or historically, for the Soviet era.
While Lithuania, which has granted citizenship and the right to vote to most
Russians living on its territory, has enjoyed good relations with Moscow,
Latvia and Estonia are engaged in a vigorous debate on the troop question.
Citizenship and language laws have strained relations in both states, where
1.5m ethnic Russians live.
The troop withdrawal was repeatedly halted, most recently in Estonia after
the country passed a discriminatory aliens law.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, last week said: 'Russian
troops will not leave the Baltic states until an agreement is completed
which guarantees the Russian-speaking minority's rights.' Mr Kozyrev
affirmed his support for an autonomy vote in Narva, an Estonian city that is
95 per cent Russian.
An Estonian government spokeswoman likened the move to the Russian army's
involvement in conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan.
Both sides are playing on the European diplomatic field, where Russia and
the Baltic states are eager to look good and preserve western political and
financial assistance.
Estonia pulls no punches in trying to break from the past, in the process
alienating the Russian population, and rekindling historical links,
especially to Scandinavian countries.
President Lennart Meri asked both the Council of Europe and the Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe to review the controversial aliens
law before signing an amended version - an unprecedented move for a
sovereign state but indicative of Estonia's desire for European blessing.
Russia similarly covets Council of Europe membership - awarded to Estonia
over Russian objections earlier this summer - but seems willing to
jeopardise entry by refusing to honour international resolutions by the
Council and the United Nations for 'early, orderly and complete withdrawal'.
This signal, Baltic leaders contend, shows hardline nationalists still have
a strong hand in Moscow, advocating any means, including military conquest,
to secure rights for the 25m ethnic Russians who live outside Russia.
A United Nations observer arrives in the three countries on August 28 to
monitor the pace of Russia's pullout. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime
minister, has mediated in recent tensions and has called on Russia to
expedite the withdrawal.
Moscow, as usual, now holds all the cards. Western leaders, especially Mr
Bildt, see troop pullout as an important test of how Russia handles
relations with republics which, unlike Belarus or the Central Asian
republics, want to sever political ties to the east.

FT  23 AUG 93 / A note of disharmony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerard Mortier, artistic director of the Salzburg Festival, does not fear
controversy. His enemies might suggest that he positively courts it. Whether
as general administrator of the Brussels Monnaie - an operatic backwater
which in the 1980s he transformed into one of the most adventurous and
exciting of Europe's front-rank opera houses - or now at Salzburg, the
49-year-old, small, bespectacled Belgian has demonstrated a unique capacity
for arousing strong passions.
Last summer there was, for instance, a war of words after the departure of
Riccardo Muti from the festival before the opening of the new production of
Mozart's opera La clemenza di Tito. At the 11th hour, Muti found it too
'modern' for his taste.
This summer, with the festival now into its final week, there has been a hue
and cry over a new production of Mozart's Cos fan tutte in modern dress and
experimental style. The first-night audience booed ferociously; debacle and
flop were some of the terms of abuse lobbed by the Austrian press.
At about the same time another highly publicised dispute had broken out with
another Italian superstar, this time Claudio Abbado. The argument concerned
Abbado's provocatively timed announcement of a plan to conduct a new
production of Strauss's Elektra at the 1995 Salzburg Easter Festival, a
short springtime offspring of the main festival. Mortier said the project
was in direct and improper competition with the new Elektra he had already
planned for summer later that year. Charges of bad faith flew back and
forth. Unusually, it is Mortier who has backed down: Abbado's Elektra will
be the one given in 1995.
Though the furores provide fodder for entertaining cafe chatter, they also
represent, in artistic and economic terms, a tug-of-war of considerable
significance.
There is much at stake. For a sizeable chunk of the post-war era - roughly
contiguous with the latter 25 years (1964-89) of Herbert von Karajan's life
 -Salzburg secured a position as the most luxurious of the top-level annual
summer festivals. The Salzburg-born Karajan, probably the 20th century's
most consistently power-hungry superstar conductor, moulded the enterprise
into an emporium for top-name performers, giving glossily spectacular
accounts of themselves at exorbitant ticket prices. The record companies,
particularly those with which the conductor-boss was involved, were able to
treat the festival as a showcase.
Artistically, the formula became sterile. Invitations to take part depended
on Karajan's favour. Perceived rivals, such as Leonard Bernstein, or
unwelcome trend-setters, like the pioneering Austrian period-instrument
conductor, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, were rigorously excluded. The experiments
in radical production that gripped European opera in the late 1970s and
1980s found no place in Salzburg.
Mortier was brought in to change all this.
Having learnt his operatic trade throughout the 1970s in, successively,
Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Paris, he went to Brussels in 1981 to
take charge of a Sleeping Beauty opera house - once-great, then mired in
mediocrity and restrictive practices, with a disaffected audience.
Though the architectural renewal of the building, including an office
extension at roof level, remains a cause of dispute, the artistic renewal
gave Brussels opera a distinctively forward-looking feel.
He had no truck with opera-as-showbiz and with its stars: 'My public knows,'
he once said, 'that the doors of the Monnaie are too small for Pavarotti,
the corridors too narrow for Jessye Norman.' He has been called narrowly
puritan in his tastes, yet in a short time the Monnaie became one of the hot
places of international opera.
Mortier has wasted no time in making his mark in Salzburg. Under Peter
Stein, the celebrated German theatre director who serves as drama overseer,
the drama programme has come vibrantly alive. The choice and style of opera
presentation reflect what might be called the Monnaie imperatives: Mozart
rethought, 20th-century masterpieces, Monteverdi revived. Period-instrument
performance, banned by Karajan, is a regular feature.
Orchestras of quality from all over the world figure on the concert
schedule.
But the outcome of the campaign is far from certain. There is more than the
Karajan mystique for Mortier to root out, more than the disapproval of
record companies and top artists' agencies to confront, more than the
Austrian press's periodic fits of artistic xenophobia to withstand. A new,
more adventurous audience has to be attracted. Ticket prices for prestige
events remain among the world's highest (this year's top was Sch3,600, or
Pounds 201). Except for the surefire operas - The Magic Flute, Cos, Verdi's
Falstaff conducted by Georg Solti - bookings are down. Grumbling traders,
hoteliers and taxi-drivers are not hard to find.
In addition, Mortier has the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra to cope with.
Formerly the festival mainstay, it now bitterly resents the way its role in
both the opera and concert schedules is being whittled down. When questioned
about this, Mortier is apt to comment, with the tartness of rejoinder for
which he is noted, on the high cost of keeping one of the world's most
admired, but most expensive, orchestras in Salzburg residence.
He is on a six-year contract in Salzburg, although it could be terminated
earlier if the need proved overwhelming. Among more progressive musicians
and critics, and in the wider world of opera, Mortier's Salzburg stance
commands a unique degree of sympathy, respect and approval. But that may not
be enough to guarantee his survival.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Monday Interview: Cabinet's ideological juggler - David
Hunt, UK employment secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, like many successful politicians, is something of a
chameleon.
At an open-air dinner in Salt Lake City, Utah, last month, he donned a
cowboy hat and did his bit for the 'special relationship' between the US and
the UK. He lavished praise on the job-creating American economy, spoke
admiringly of the 'workfare' system which requires people on welfare to work
for their benefits, and asked for US support in the battle against the
forces of regulation and protection within the European Community.
His Mormon hosts might be surprised to learn that at home Mr Hunt is
considered by some critics in the Tory party to be a left-wing Europhile,
rather than a true Anglo-Saxon free marketeer.
Hunt, who took over as employment secretary in the cabinet reshuffle in May,
and is the government's newest rising star, denies that he belongs on the
left wing of the Conservative party. He says he has always been a mainstream
'one-nation' Tory. But he was tagged with the left-wing label after his
attack on Enoch Powell at the 1972 Conservative party conference over the
issue of Ugandan Asians settling in the UK. He paid a price - he was
immediately deselected as candidate for the winnable seat of Plymouth Drake.
Yet, he is happy to hint at non-conformist sympathies. The sharp-featured
51-year-old, who backed Michael Heseltine for the Tory party leadership,
describes himself as a Christian Democrat, speaks of the social market
economy, and talks proudly of the public-private partnerships and close
links with the trade unions he fostered in his three years as Welsh
secretary from 1990-93.
But is there a sturdy body of ideas behind these phrases? And can avowed
post-Thatcherites, such as Hunt, who now dominate the cabinet, produce a
distinctive new Conservatism for the late 1990s?
'The underlying theme for me is competitiveness,' says Hunt, looking rather
crumpled after a whistle-stop tour of the US. He has won praise from many on
the right of his party for his vigorous parliamentary performances defending
the competitiveness of the UK's labour market and the 'opt-out' obtained by
Prime Minister John Major from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
He claims the employment debate in Europe is now shifting from labour
regulation towards UK-style flexibility, partly inspired by the
earlier-than-expected downward trend in UK unemployment.
But has flexibility been bought at too high a price? Hunt forcefully rejects
the criticism that Britain is pursuing a competitiveness strategy based on
cheap and low-skilled labour. He is equally dismissive of the view that many
British workplaces are ruled by fear of unemployment. 'I don't recognise
this atmosphere and I've visited a lot of workplaces in the last three
years,' says Hunt.
He professes no interest in an overhaul of British labour law to improve
employer-employee relationships.
He does, however, accept that there can be some conflict between the goal of
developing highly skilled, committed and secure workers, and the employment
flexibility required by tough and sometimes unpredictable global markets.
His answer is Investors In People, the government-backed initiative to
encourage companies to connect training to their broader business
objectives. However, after two years, fewer than 400 companies have
qualified.
The government cannot have a direct role in promoting competitiveness, Hunt
says, reflecting his view that government is a 'necessary evil'. That fits
with his concept of the social market that free markets create the
prosperity to provide resources for generous welfare benefits.
This all sounds very orthodox. But his right-wing opponents in the party -
advocates of minimum welfare, minimum tax and minimum state - have some
grounds for discomfort. Away from the Mormons, Hunt confides his doubts
about whether US-style workfare can be applied to the UK's benefits system.
As part of the government's public spending review in the run-up to the
November Budget, he is examining ways of cutting welfare dependency, but he
stresses: 'One of the strengths of our system is that we provide
unemployment benefit indefinitely.'
Hunt is also keen to see the government's 'highly successful' Training and
Enterprise Councils 'getting much more involved in economic development' -
in plainer words, industrial policy.
He refuses to be drawn on whether there is, or should be, a future for
collective bargaining in the UK, saying only that 'it is up to employers and
employees to choose'. But he does say 'my door is open' to the Trades Union
Congress, and even advises the unions to cut their exclusive links with the
Labour party, in favour of broader political contacts 'with the Conservative
party and others'.
For all his radical gestures Hunt has prospered in his 14 years in
government, including a period as deputy chief whip, and has survived close
association with the poll tax. He has a courteous, clubbable manner, and has
generally won the respect of colleagues and civil servants. He is a
strategic politician, preferring to leave the details to officials.
Speculation that he could succeed the prime minister seems far-fetched,
although he appears to have the necessary ambition.
As a political philosopher he has been less successful. A recent speech to
the Tory Reform Group, written with Michael McManus, a former member of the
Social Democratic party and now Hunt's political adviser, attempted a
synthesis between the free-market individualism of the Thatcherites and his
own more pragmatic views, but concluded rather limply that choice and
responsibility were the Tory concepts for the 1990s.
The attempt to express his views without causing too much offence to his
free-market colleagues also leads Hunt into some strange convolutions. In a
recent speech he said it was the government's duty 'where necessary, to
remedy market failure through direct intervention'. He added later: 'When we
in government speak about partnership, we are not therefore speaking about
nationalisation, nor about interventionism nor about corporatism.'
One of his close political colleagues says the real clue to Hunt is that his
ideas spring primarily from sentiment and experience. What divides him from
the Euro-sceptics, for example, seems to be more an attitude than strongly
differing views about monetary policy or national sovereignty in Europe.
He agrees, saying that much of the Maastricht dispute was 'completely
unnecessary and not founded on true policy divisions'. His own Europhile
roots he traces to his time as a leading member of half a dozen youth
organisations - including the Young Conservatives and the British Youth
Council - through which he became friends with young leaders from other
European countries, such as Volker Ruhe, now German defence minister.
Hunt also speculates that his enthusiasm for Europe, 'which really brought
me into politics', stems from his background in an 'outward looking
Liverpool shipping family'. The family owned the first iron ship to cross
the Atlantic, but Hunt, who rejected the sea to become a solicitor before
going into politics, says he has learnt a cosmopolitan attitude and a deep
dislike of corporate socialism from his Liverpool roots.
Yet when he talks about Europe it becomes evident that the differences
within his party are not just of attitude. Moving up a rhetorical gear he
speaks of 'deeper dimensions . . . ever closer union of the European
peoples' and of Europe being 'substantially more than just an economic
free-trade zone'.
We are likely to see and hear a lot more of David Hunt in the next few
years. To date he has made his mark as an ideological juggler rather than as
the author of a coherent new Tory philosophy. But if his party ever loses an
election, his hour may come.

FT  23 AUG 93 / A contrary view on healthcare: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the few spheres of life in which proponents of free markets have
suffered a devastating defeat is healthcare. After 50 years of quasi or
fully socialised medicine in most of the industrialised world, economists
are nearly united in believing that the normal laws of supply and demand
cannot and should not be allowed to function (doctors and lay observers, of
course, have always taken this for granted). To control costs and ensure
fair access to care, governments (or their agents) must supervise the
provision and the financing of care, if not actually own hospitals and pay
for them with taxes.
Nothing supposedly shows more clearly the folly of relying on the private
sector than the US's chronic problems. The one rich country that tried to
buck the trend toward socialised medicine isconfronting a large uninsured
population (37m people lack easy access to care) and uncontrollable pressure
for higher spending (healthcare absorbs 14 per cent of national income,
against 7-8 per cent in other rich countries.) The surprise is thus not that
the Clinton administration is attempting to extend the role of federal
government but that this was delayed for so long.
This conventional wisdom is so well entrenched that it is refreshing to see
the opposite point of view argued with clarity and commitment. In Patient
Power: Solving America's Health Care Crisis*, economists John Goodman and
Gerald Musgrave first try to dispose of the argument that US experience has
proven the inadequacy of free markets.
Nothing, they claim, could be further from a real market than the US system
in which nearly all healthcare is financed by employers or the government.
Consumer preferences determine neither the overall level of spending nor the
allocation of resources between different types of treatment; the system is
as paternalistic as any in Europe while lacking any semblance of cost
controls.
The solution, according to Goodman and Musgrave, lies in abandoning the
belief that healthcare is 'different.' It is ludicrous, they say, to argue
that individuals lack the knowledge to make wise decisions; the same could
be said of many other fields, such as finance, where the products are highly
complex. And a glance at the way medicine really operates shows that all
involved are just as self-interested as in supposedly more commercial
spheres. The challenge is to direct self-interest in socially useful
directions and to give the 'experts' an incentive to use their knowledge for
the benefit of the consumer.
Dismissing the Clinton strategy, which involves an extension of employers'
responsibilities, Goodman and Musgrave advocate putting individuals in the
healthcare driving seat. The first step would be to replace the large tax
incentives (worth Dollars 60bn (Pounds 43bn) a year) for employer health
schemes with a modest tax credit claimable only by individuals. Companies
that persisted in providing health insurance would have to include the
benefit as part of gross wages and give employees the option of taking this
benefit in cash. The result would be a rapid growth in personal health
insurance, although most people would probably opt to join large, managed
care groups. But the link between health insurance and employment would be
broken.
The second step would be to promote personal saving for health expenses as
an alternative to private insurance and government welfare. Individuals
would receive tax relief only for 'catastrophic' health insurance - cover
for relatively improbable but potentially very expensive care, such as open
heart surgery. Catastrophic insurance tends to be much cheaper than policies
that also cover every minor ailment.
All routine low-cost care (up to, say, Dollars 2,000 a year) would be paid
for out of savings. To make this possible the government would give
employees (and employers) tax incentives to build up 'medisave' accounts.
These would reduce health spending in two ways. First individuals would have
an incentive to economise since any unspent cash in medisave accounts would
form part of their personal wealth. Also, most health bills would be paid
out of pocket, thus greatly reducing administrative costs.
Government would have a drastically reduced role. Rather than setting up
special programmes for the poor, it would restrict itself to providing
direct financial support to individuals to enable them to buy the insurance
they need. The level of support would depend on health needs as well as
income, reflecting the higher cost of insurance policies for people who have
(or have had) serious illnesses.
There is no chance that such policies will be tried in the near future. But
as technology advances, increasing the range and cost of potential
treatments, the 'one size fits all' health policies championed by many
governments may come under increasing pressure. Individual preferences
(which vary a great deal) surely ought to determine crucial trade offs - for
example between spending on consumption today and on extremely expensive
medical treatment to prolong life by a few months. Yet such rational
decision making could occur only in an individualised, truly market-oriented
system such as that outlined by Goodman and Musgrave.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Bundesbank meets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER four weeks of crisis, the currency markets will be back to their old
habits this week, trying to guess what the Bundesbank will do at its council
meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
The last Bundesbank meeting before its summer recess was, of course, the one
at which it failed to cut the discount rate and keep the exchange rate
mechanism within its former fluctuation bands.
Ironically, there is strong speculation that the Bundesbank will cut its
discount rate at the forthcoming session, because the repo rate, at 6.80 per
cent, is so close to the discount rate floor of 6.75 per cent.
But, even if this does happen, few people expect the repo rate, which sets
the cost of lending short-term funds to commercial banks, to be reduced.
Instead, the central bank is likely to keep its weekly money market tenders
tight for some time. That is because the M3 money supply figure for August
should remain high, reflecting the high level of intervention.
After last week's surprising intervention by the US Federal Reserve in
support of the dollar/yen exchange rate, dealers will be waiting to see
today whether the Japanese currency resumes its upward move.
In the absence of intervention on Friday, the yen rose again, piercing the
Y105 level in London. If Japanese exporters anticipate another rise in their
currency, they may be encouraged to sell dollars now in the belief that they
could get fewer yen for them if they wait.
The response of the US authorities will also be important. Mr Shaun Osborne,
a senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in London, said:
'Consistent central bank support will be needed to convince the market that
the game is up.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Flexibility broadens appeal of customised
options deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH London and New York stock markets scoring historic highs, big-time
money managers are seeking hedges to protect their profits and risk
management specialists are finding ready buyers for their customised options
strategies.
While sophisticated small investors generally use exchange-traded options to
protect share value or add to a speculative position, institutions with
billions of dollars under management turn to the over-the-counter market,
where deep-pocketed private dealers write them customised options.
Exchange-traded options typically lock a user into fixed terms and strike
prices and lack the flexibility required by institutions.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, in a bid to capture some of Wall
Street's private business, launched its own version of customised options
six months ago. The CBOE's 'Flex Options', as they are called, allow
institutions to buy or sell options on the benchmark Standard and Poor's 100
and 500 indices with four different customised features.
This month, the CBOE added the Russell Index, a basket of 2,000
small-capitalisation US stocks, to its Flex options product line. Flex users
can select their own strike prices, pick expiration dates up to five years
into the future, and choose their preferred method of settlement and the
style of options exercise.
The exercise choices are American style, where the option can be exercised
anytime before expiration, and European style, where the option can be
exercised only on the last business day of the contract.
Much bigger than the CBOE's standard index options, Flex options contracts
have a minimum face value of Dollars 10m. Since the CBOE listed Flex options
on February 26 there have been 168,477 trades for a notional face value of
Dollars 7.5bn.
The exchange products are far from eclipsing the estimated Dollars 50bn in
customised equity options traded over the counter each year. How-ever, Flex
options use is expected to grow as customers learn more about the product.
'Flex offers customised structuring of exposures. There is a great need for
this by smaller- and medium-sized money managers,' says Mr Jack Hanson,
partner in Clifton Group, the Minneapolis-based investment management
company.
While the Flex options do not offer the compete freedom of over-the-counter
contracts, they are suitable for many 'plain vanilla' options hedges used by
institutions. And, unlike their private counterparts, their pricing is
public and easily accessible.
Also, for corporations concerned about credit quality, the CBOE's new
products are backed by the exchange's top-rated options clearing house.
'We're trying to complement the over-the-counter market,' said Mr David
Hall, CBOE vice-president for international marketing. 'There are still a
lot of exotic options that we can't accommodate at the exchange.'
The Flex concept has proved so successful that the exchange plans to give it
an international dimension. 'Our next phase is to list some foreign indices,
including Flex options on a US-dollar-denominated FT-SE 100 index,' said Mr
Hall.
The exchange holds rights to trade dollar-settled versions of FT-SE
instruments, and trades standard options on the FT-SE index now. In another
bid for international business, the exchange will soon add another
customised aspect to the product: users will be able to choose the currency
in which they would like their options settled.
The CBOE's bid for international customers could be pre-empted by copy-cat
products at European exchanges. Officials at Liffe, London's futures and
options exchange, say they are seriously considering listing
sterling-settled flexible options on the FT-SE 100 index.
CBOE officials say they have also received queries about the product from
Matif, France's futures exchange, as well as from the Tokyo stock exchange.
The CBOE's domestic rival, the American Stock Exchange in New York, plans to
roll out its own customised index options product later this year.

FT  23 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Mexican stand-off raises fears of
prices decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S determination to raise funds as cheaply as possible has raised
fears that investors could lose confidence temporarily in the emerging
markets sector of the international bond market.
Three years ago, Mexican borrowers led the way for other Latin American
countries into the international capital markets for the first time since
the debt crisis of the 1980s. So far, even the most cynical investor would
have difficulty playing down the success of their return.
The most important gauge of this success has been the dramatic improvement
in the pricing of Latin American Eurobond issues relatively quickly.
Furthermore, their offerings now appeal to a much wider range of investors
as the market becomes more liquid.
However bankers are worried a lot of this progress could come undone if
Mexico attempts to force what they perceive to be aggressive funding targets
on unwilling investors. Currently, Mexican state-owned borrowers have to pay
a premium, or 'spread', of just over 200 basis points above the yield on US
Treasuries, widely seen to be the threshold for borrowers without an
investment grade rating.
The only Latin American countries to have achieved an investment grade
rating so far are Chile and Colombia, assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
credit rating agency.
Mexico has a credit rating of BB+ from S&amp;P and Ba2 from Moody's, the other
leading US rating agency. Although the country is thought to be close to
gaining an investment grade rating, bankers do not believe this will be
assigned until the North American Free Trade Agreement comes into force at
the start of next year. And bankers are confident that Mexico will be
assigned an investment grade rating shortly afterwards.
However, it appears that the Hacienda, Mexico's finance ministry, is
unwilling to wait that long and has been trying to force the issue with the
investment community.
To reach its objective, the Hacienda appears to be preventing government
agencies from borrowing funds at a spread of more than 200 basis points
above US Treasuries. By law, any transaction by a Mexican agency has to be
approved by the finance ministry.
There have been reports that this was why some weeks ago an international
bond offering for the state-owned Comision Federal de Electricidad was
postponed at the last minute.
Bankers say the Hacienda has been encouraged to take this stance since
Mexico has been able to raise short-dated funds under its Euro-commercial
programme at a spread of just 125 basis points above US Treasuries.
But they add there is only limited investor appeal for Mexican paper at this
level of pricing, partly because of the short maturity of three or six
months. In their view, it would be difficult to bring a large bond issue
with a longer maturity at a similar spread over US Treasuries.
Bankers fear that what has become known as the 'Mexican stand-off' could
lead to a fall in prices of Latin American bonds. 'It is a big step to push
through this level,' says one banker, adding that a badly-timed deal could
prompt heavy profit-taking in Latin American bonds.
Bankers believe Mexico will get close to its funding target over the coming
months, but they reckon it would be against its long-term interest to try it
at all costs.
The country would find itself competing against sovereign borrowers with
better credit ratings and its impatience could end up alienating investors,
they warn. 'Mexico is no longer the only game in town,' says one banker.
Indeed, investors can now choose from a much wider range of Latin American
issuers. In 1990, Mexican issuers accounted for more than 75 per cent of all
Latin American Eurobonds. However, this proportion has dropped below 50 per
cent.
Argentine and Brazilian borrowers now make regular appearances in the
international bond market. Over the past year, the first deals were launched
for Uruguay, Colombia, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Chile.
Last week, Anacafe, Guatemala's national coffee association, raised Dollars
60m through a three-year issue of amortising notes.
In addition, Peruvian borrowers are expected to make their debut on the
market in the fourth quarter, kicking off with a three-year issue by a
state-owned bank.
Bankers are confident any fall-out from the Mexican pricing issue will not
damage the emerging market sector of the Euromarket in the long term. 'The
spread on best credits should continue to tighten,' one banker says.
They note that the increasing number of large and comparable bond issues
have established valuable benchmarks from which issuers and investors alike
are able to get a good sense of pricing.

FT  23 AUG 93 / European Bonds: Little sign of German interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WILL they or won't they?' is the question buzzing round the European
government bond markets. For what everyone wants to know is whether the
Bundesbank's council members will agree to cut interest rates when they
convene for their first meeting after the summer recess on Thursday, paving
the way for other European central banks to ease.
It was the Bundesbank's failure to lower the key discount (or floor) rate at
its last meeting in July that precipitated a crisis in the European exchange
rate mechanism. As a result the whole system had to be revamped at the
beginning of August. When the European government bond markets opened on
August 2, they found the fluctuation bands within which currencies could
move had been widened to 15 per cent, dressing up a floating-rate system as
a semi-fixed one and raising expectations that most of Europe's central
banks would have a free rein to slash interest rates.
Given that the Bundesbank was not prepared to lower its key interest rate at
the end of July - and in the process rescue the old-style European exchange
rate mechanism - what reason is there to believe it will cut rates this
time?
'Although the weakness of the west German economy, and the recent attempts
by the government to reduce the budget deficit keep open the chance of a
rate cut, it is difficult to see the recent German data triggering an easing
this coming week,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB
International.
The Bundesbank's latest monthly report stressed that monetary growth and
inflation were still too high, and that the July M3 money supply figures,
released last week, had crushed hopes of an imminent easing. Many in the
market had predicted the July M3 figure would be 'artificially high', since
it was expected to include the effects of intervention related to ERM
turbulence at the end of last month.
However, in the event not only was the figure high at 7.5 per cent (compared
with 7.0 per cent in June and well above the Bundesbank's target range of
between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent), but it turned out that intervention had
little to do with the number. In fact, the effects of intervention will show
up in the August figures instead.
In addition to poor money supply figures, economists point out that the
Bundesbank is unlikely to get much joy from the cost-of-living figures due
out this week, as these are expected to show that inflation remains
stubbornly high.
Against this background, many say there is not much chance of the Bundesbank
delighting the market with a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate -
although some economists point out that the mere five basis point difference
between the discount rate (now 6.75 per cent) and the repo rate (6.80 per
cent) means it is possible the Bundesbank may make a technical adjustment to
the former.
Mr Adrian James, international bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets,
believes that 'even a cut in the discount rate (at this Thursday's Council
meeting) is unlikely to be followed by much action on the repo rate'. So ERM
members will have to act on their own initiative, rather than waiting for
Germany to move first.

FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation euphoria begins to wane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT bond markets do not like booms. Any doubters have only to look at
how the long end of the gilts market has been propelled to the highest
levels for more than a generation by the UK's low inflation and
modestly-paced economic recovery.
Reflecting on recent statistics, Mr Neil Williams, economist at Daiwa, the
Japanese bank, said: 'The past three months have seen nothing but good news,
particularly on the inflation front.'
But are the figures too good to be true? Towards the end of last week,
profit-taking and a slight waning of bullishness saw prices ease slightly.
'The danger is that this current mood of optimism about inflation won't
last,' said one London fund manager. 'If there is just a ripple of inflation
in the autumn the long bonds, which are super-sensitive, will come down.'
Furthermore, when looked at in comparison with European bonds, the rally at
the long end looks less justified than it does in a domestic context.
The spread between gilts and German bunds, for example, has become so tight
that some analysts do not believe gilts have much further to rise, other
than in the context of a general rally in European government bonds.
'This rally has been an out-performance relative to the rest of Europe,'
said Mr David Mackie, UK economist at JP Morgan, the US investment bank.
The current spread between bunds and gilts is 75 basis points, compared with
more than 100 basis points six months ago. Between French OATs and bunds the
spread is close to zero, while the spread between bunds and Spanish bonds is
about 300 basis points.
'If one sees the spread as a reflection of inflation expectations, then
clearly the market expects French inflation to match German inflation in the
medium term, even though French inflation is currently much lower,' said Mr
Mackie.
The implication of the spread between Germany and Spain is that the market
does not expect Spain to be able to control inflation in the long run.
'So to have a spread of 75 for the UK probably means that, on average over
the next few years, UK inflation is going to be only less than one
percentage point above German inflation. I think that is too optimistic in
the medium term,' said Mr Mackie.
There are reasons to be sceptical about the UK's chances of performing so
well in relation to German inflation, even if price rises remain subdued by
UK standards.
Underlying inflation in Germany, which strips out the distorting effects of
taxation, is at roughly 3.5 per cent, while underlying inflation in the UK -
the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments - is just under
3 per cent.
But Germany is some two years behind the UK in the economic cycle, and has
further big gains in inflation to look forward to.
Although inflation in the UK may stay low, there is a general feeling among
economists that it has already seen most of the gains it can expect to have
on the inflation front.
This view was reinforced by the small upwards movement in both the headline
and underlying rates of inflation revealed in official figures published
last week.
These showed that prices rose 1.4 per cent in the year to July, compared
with 1.2 per cent in the previous month. Underlying inflation was 2.9 per
cent, compared with 2.8 per cent.
'From a purely domestic point of view, the rally in gilts looks justified,'
said Mr Mackie. 'But vis-a-vis Europe, it looks as though we have overshot.'
In spite of these gloomy thoughts, the gilt bulls are still out there.
'These stunningly good levels can be maintained,' said Mr Nick Knight, head
of strategy at Nomura Research.
'I think the fact that the inflation picture is sufficiently stable, and
that news on the public sector borrowing requirement will improve as growth
picks up, means that we can hold these levels.'
Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, echoes these
thoughts. 'The shift in inflation expectations means we have seen the gilts
market shift to a new yield level of between 7 1/4 and 7 1/2 per cent at the
long end,' he said.
Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a rise in yields of about 10 basis points.
The increase was slightly less further out. On Friday night, the 8 per cent
Treasury bond maturing in 2003 was quoted at 107 9/32 to yield 6.96 per
cent, almost a point lower on the week.
Further out, the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2017 was quoted at
115 3/8 , yielding 7.37 per cent compared with 115 13/16 .

FT  23 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Bets off as yields spiral continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY not just sit back and enjoy the ride? That is the message from Wall
Street in the face of the seemingly unstoppable rise in long-dated Treasury
bond prices.
Sceptics, punished by spiralling prices for their lack of faith in the long
end of the market, are finally throwing in the towel. It is the sort of
resigned mood that in the past had signalled the peak of a bull market -
although given the momentum that has been building in prices, it would take
a pretty strong constitution to short the bond market just now.
For weeks, market followers have been lowering their forecasts for long-term
yields as rates have plumbed one seemingly improbable depth after another.
Fed up with trying to call the bottom - or even a temporary halt to the rise
in prices - many have concluded that a 5 1/2 per cent yield on the long
bond, or even one as low as 5 per cent, is within sight.
Typical of the revisionism in the air is the opening to Friday's weekly
market commentary from Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a Wall Street broker:
'The continued proliferation of weaker-than-anticipated economic data, and
of better-than-expected inflation news suggests that our previously defined
target of 7 per cent for long bond yields is untenable.' (Unlike many,
though, DLJ still clings to the view that the market will fall back slightly
by the year-end.)
By the end of last week, virtually all the forecasts made as recently as two
months ago were looking equally untenable. Halfway through this year, a 7
per cent yield on the long bond by the year-end had been a common
prediction. On Friday, the yield on the 30-year benchmark ended at 6.21 per
cent - around 15 basis points lower than the previous week's breath-taking
low and a full 50 basis points (or half a percentage point) lower than a
month before.
Each time the market falls back - as it did briefly on Friday - a new surge
of buying lifts it again. Fixed income mutual funds - fed by a continuing
shift out of bank deposits and money market funds - have been throwing ever
bigger piles of cash at the bond market. In the first six months, these
funds made Dollars 59.7bn of net new purchases of bonds - as much as they
made in the whole of 1991, and two-thirds of the record investment made in
the 1992.
'The pressures are still very strong for cash to go into Treasuries -
there's no real yield on cash whatsoever,' says Mr Barton Biggs of Morgan
Stanley.
The search for yield elsewhere has led investors to emerging market equities
or bonds: markets which are simply too small or illiquid for big US fund
managers to provide anything other than a marginal investment. US real
estate yields of 8 per cent have provided one alternative (Mr Biggs says
Morgan Stanley has taken its holdings from nothing to 9 per cent of assets
in less than six months).
However, for the big money looking for a liquid market outside equities  -
which themselves touched new highs last week, pushing the yield down still
further to nearly 2.5 per cent - Treasuries and investment grade corporate
paper remain about the only option.
There was another reason for last week's run-up in prices: the latest
benchmark 30-year bond, the 6 1/4 per cent Treasury due 2023, has added
scarcity value given that no new long bonds will be auctioned until next
February. That pushed its yield at one stage last week to 20 basis points
below that available at the same time on the previous benchmark, the 7 1/8
stock due 2023, suggesting that a large part of the latest rally may be
purely technical.
Where will it all end? Moderate GDP growth and current inflation at around 3
per cent, and easing, provides the sort of background against which
long-term inflation expectations could continue to fall.
Why shouldn't real (after-inflation) long-term interest rates fall to the 3
per cent level of the 1950s and 1960s, ask observers like Mr Stephen Slifer
of Lehman Brothers. That makes long bond yields of 5 1/2 per cent a real
possibility, and soon.
A grudging Mr Biggs, who has reduced his bond weighting from 40 per cent at
the peak to 27 per cent now, concedes: 'Can yields get to 6 per cent, or
even 5 3/4 ? Yes.'
But he adds: 'For the bond market, it's late in the game - we're already in
the fourth quarter.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: German banks prosper in bleak
climate - David Waller examines why fears for the industry's health have
been confounded by strong results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, Germany's third-biggest bank, has seen no let-up in profits
growth during the past two months. Coming shortly after it reported 16.5 per
cent growth in profits for the first six months of the year, Commerzbank's
continuing strength serves to underscore the fact that Germany's banking
sector remains a bastion of prosperity amid the country's worst recession
since the second world war.
Analysts had feared the half-year results for Germany's big banks, published
in the past few weeks, would reveal weaknesses in the sector. This fear was
based on the banks' decision to report provisions against bad and doubtful
debts for the first time, ahead of a European Community directive which will
make such disclosure mandatory for the full-year results.
In the event, provisions notwithstanding, the results were better than
expected and the German banking sector is looking solid. Taking the new
measure for assessing banks' profitability - total operating profits after
provisions - the big five banks managed growth rates of between 12.6 per
cent (Deutsche Bank) and 24.8 per cent (Hypobank).
And although provisions grew by as much as 45 per cent at Deutsche Bank,
Germany's biggest bank, and 25 per cent at Dresdner, the second biggest,
analysts were pleasantly surprised at what the new figures implied about the
bad debt situation in Germany.
'The information is still incomplete,' said Susan Sternglass at Goldman
Sachs in London, 'but all the evidence suggests that the German banks have
for several years been making sizeable provisions against bad and doubtful
debts in anticipation of the downturn.
'This means that now the downturn has actually materialised, bad debt
charges do not have to rise dramatically.'
The implication is that German banks will this year match, if not beat, the
record level of profits made last year. Along with construction companies -
main beneficiaries of a building boom in eastern Germany - the banking
industry is one of only two German stock-market sectors likely to increase
earnings this year.
This raises at least two questions: how have the banks been able to defy a
recession likely to mean a decline of at least 2 per cent in German GDP this
year, and can this immunity to the downturn last?
The central factor behind the rise in total profits in the first six months
of the year was a surge in profits from own-account trading. At four out of
the five biggest banks, these profits more than doubled against the
comparable period for last year. At Dresdner Bank they more than trebled.
The smallest rate of increase was 42 per cent at the Deutsche Bank -
impressive considering that these DM808m (Dollars 480.9m) profits were
bigger than trading profits combined at its two nearest rivals.
These strong trading results reflect highly favourable market conditions in
currency and securities markets. The bund market rally in the early part of
the year was followed by a strong performance in the German equity market,
with the DAX index of 30 leading shares up by more than 18 per cent in the
first six months. The banks have also benefited from high volatility and
trading volumes in currency markets.
Market activity also stimulated commission income generated through
securities transactions conducted on customers' behalf. This category of
profit rose at between 13 per cent (Deutsche) and 21 per cent (Hypobank).
Commission income combined with trading profits thus offset a slowdown in
earnings on interest income, the mainstay of a bank's business. Here growth
slowed from the levels of last year when, according to a Bundesbank analysis
published in its monthly report for August, net interest income climbed at
10 per cent.
However growth in interest earnings has by no means died away altogether: in
the first half, it still rose 7.4 per cent at Deutsche, 4.6 per cent at
Dresdner, and more than 10 per cent at Hypobank. This reflects the
relaxation of minimum reserve requirements which, earlier this year, freed
DM25bn of capital on which the banks had hitherto earned no interest.
Continuing strong demand for mortgage borrowing, driven by sharp cuts in
long-term interest rates over the past year, has also helped.
Will fortune continue to smile on German banks? Mr Ian McEwen, banking
analyst at Merrill Lynch, is not sanguine. He believes that banks' margins
will be squeezed in a lower interest-rate environment, and that the impact
of the downturn will be felt more sharply in 1994, when provisioning will
have to be raised still further.
'It will be hard for the banks to generate profit growth in 1994,' he
concluded. On this basis, he argues that all German banks, but for Deutsche
Bank, are overvalued in stock-market terms.
However, for the time being German banks' biggest problem is an enviable
one: that of being embarrassingly profitable when virtually everywhere else
in the German economy earnings are collapsing.

THE BOARD of governors of the Commodity Exchange, the New York precious
metals futures exchange, has approved the terms of a proposed merger with
the New York Mercantile Exchange. This sets the stage for voting by members
on the Dollars 60m plan before the end of the year.
Although the Comex board approval had been expected, it is viewed as a
victory for Mr Daniel Rappaport, the Nymex chairman.
Since assuming the chairmanship in January, Mr Rappaport has succeeded in
smoothing historical animosities between the two exchange's trading
populations, which have blocked previous merger plans.
The Nymex has offered to pay Comex members Dollars 50m in cash. Of this,
about Dollars 15m will come from the Comex's own treasury at the time the
deal closes, while Dollars 20m will be deferred and distributed in equal
payments of Dollars 5m, plus interest, in each of the next four years.
Comex has about 775 members. In order to quell any opposition from the Nymex
membership, the deal includes a Dollars 10m payout to members if the merger
is accomplished.
The merger would maintain the Nymex and Comex as separate divisions, and
memberships to the divisions would continue to trade separately.
Cost savings from the link-up are estimated at more than Dollars 6m a year.

deal

DRESDNER Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris have secured a licence to set up
a joint bank in Russia.
Mr Volker Burghagen, head of Dresdner's international division, said
yesterday the partners would open the offices of BNP-Dresdner Bank Rossiya
in St Petersburg on September 10, regardless of whether parliament passed a
new law limiting foreign banking activity from next January until 1996.
BNP and Dresdner have hired a staff of 80 and spent around DM2m (Dollars
1.19m) on setting up the operation, which will have a capital of Dollars
10m.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, last week sent back to parliament a
law which would restrict foreign-owned banks established in Russia to
dealing only with non-residents. The government has told parliament the law,
which would reverse the terms of licences already given, would damage
Russia's shaky investment environment.
Mr Burghagen expressed confidence that the law would 'not survive, at least
in its present form'. He noted that the government, the central bank, and
even parliament's own banking commission were opposed to it. 'This law is
outright nonsense and must be changed in the interests of the development of
the Russian economy. But we shall see.'
The law, passed at a second reading by deputies with the support of Russian
banks, would mean that foreign-owned banks in Russia could not take deposits
from Russian companies, including joint ventures, which account for most of
the foreign investment in the Russian economy so far.
But although President Yeltsin has attached four pages of objections to the
proposed legislation, it will become law if parliament passes it at a third
reading. Mr Yeltsin, who is currently pressing for new elections to usher in
a new parliament and constitution, does not have the right to veto a law a
second time.
Despite answering to parliament, the central bank has defended giving
licences to foreign banks by saying foreign competition is needed to improve
the standards of Russian commercial banking, and to encourage foreign
investment.
Before giving a licence to BNP and Dresdner - which also plan to set up a
joint bank in Poland as part of an international alliance - the central bank
had given a similar go-ahead to Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, and the
Bank of China. Bank Austria has a more limited offshore banking licence,
which would be within the rules proposed by parliament. Other western banks,
including two US banks, are waiting in the wings.
Although foreign banks do not plan to take rouble deposits to start with,
the Russian banks say they are afraid the foreign banks will steal their
prized hard-currency deposits.
They say they need time to prepare for competition, but many Russian
enterprises are naturally inclined to trust renowned foreign banks more than
the vast majority of Russia's 1,800 institutions calling themselves
commercial banks.
Part of the problem is that they are under little pressure to perform from
domestic authorities, which lack supervisory skills and have yet to start
badly-needed restructuring of the Russian banking sector.

FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades IBM debt
rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' debt rating has been downgraded two notches
by Moody's Investor Services. About Dollars 28bn in debt and securities are
affected.
The debt rating agency cited IBM's increased risks as the primary reason for
its decision to downgrade the computer company's long-term debt from A1 to
A3.
'IBM's operating results will be under pressure as it seeks to remake itself
into a more nimble, customer-focused competitor in the volatile and
intensely competitive computer industry,' the agency said.
Moody's also cut IBM's short-term debt rating, to Prime-2 from Prime 1, and
reduced the preferred stock rating to baa1 from a3, and its shelf
registration to (P)A3 from (P)A1.
Moody's noted that IBM had taken more than Dollars 28bn in restructuring
charges over the past six years. These were connected with efforts to
realign cost structure and adjust capacity levels to slowed revenue growth
rates and lower margins, with its debt increasing considerably.
The agency also said last month's restructuring actions, which included an
Dollars 8.9bn charge to cover the costs of cutting 35,000 jobs, would make
significant inroads in reducing its operating costs. IBM Deutschland, the
group's German subsidiary, plans to continue into 1995 a series of job cuts
begun in 1992, according to Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel, chief executive, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.

FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: Profits at Esab decline sharply
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESAB, the world's leading welding equipment producer, saw first-half profits
slump 66 per cent to SKr23m (Dollars 2.9m) because of a weaker performance
from its European and Brazilian operations.
Income in the second half is expected to be similar, resulting in a
full-year profit well below last year's SKr160m.
Sales rose to SKr3.38bn in the first half from SKr3.32bn, and orders
expanded to SKr3.53bn from SKr3.42bn. However, both figures were flattered
by the depreciation of the Swedish krona. On an underlying basis, sales were
7 per cent lower and orders were down 4 per cent.
The group said it was encouraged by evidence of an improving trend in some
markets. It said the Nordic and UK markets had begun to stabilise, while the
decline in central and southern Europe was slowing.
It also pointed to a 'cautious recovery' in the US, a more stable Brazilian
market, and 'a moderate rate of growth' in south-east Asia, except for
Singapore.
The group has continued to expand its market position, particularly in
eastern Europe and Russia. In the first half, it acquired 70 per cent of the
Czech Republic's leading welding company, Zelezarny-Vamberk. In Russia it
set up a jointly-owned company with Zapsibgaspromostroi (part of the Gasprom
group) to produce covered electrodes with Esab technology and equipment.
Euroc, the Swedish building materials group, boosted first-half profits
after financial items and minority shares, to SKr95m from SKr10m in the same
1992 period.
It also predicted its full-year result would be better than last year's
SKr145m.
The group said cost-cutting and lower financial costs had helped offset the
impact of reduced building activity in Sweden and Finland, and increased
price competition.
The company is not expecting an upturn in European construction activity
until 1995. In the meantime, investment in new construction in its main
markets, Sweden and Finland, is expected to fall 20 per cent this year and
15 per cent in 1994.

PHILIP Morris Asia and China National Tobacco Corporation have agreed to
co-produce Marlboro cigarettes in Shanghai.
An agreement was signed in Beijing last week. Under the accord, the two
sides will also develop and produce other brands in Ningbo, a city south of
Shanghai. The new products will aim at both domestic and international
markets.
No capital investment is expected from Philip Morris. Its role will be to
help train staff workers and upgrade leaf processing of the two existing
Chinese plants.
The CNTC monopolises China's cigarette production. Its 180 plants produce
1,500bn cigarettes a year.
Philip Morris will be the fourth international tobacco manufacturer to enter
China after RJR Nabisco, Rothmans and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Corp of Hong
Kong.
Marlboro is the most popular foreign cigarette in China. With living
standards improving quickly, more Chinese are buying imported brands. China
is the world's largest cigarette consumer, with 300m smokers consuming
1,600bn cigarettes a year.

MR HOWARD Hodgson, the entrepreneur who created the UK's biggest quoted
funeral services company, is returning to the London stock market via the
purchase of a large shareholding in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based
brewing, pubs and hotels group.
The move by Mr Hodgson, which is expected to be announced today, follows the
collapse of a proposed deal between Hoskins and Smithland Estates, a private
company run by Mr Adam Page, former chairman of Midsummer Leisure.
This would have involved the injection of Smithland's Fatty Arbuckle theme
bars into Hoskins in return for a 41 per cent stake. Hoskins broke off talks
with Smithland just over a week ago.
The Hoskins board has been facing a campaign by dissident shareholders, led
by Mr Richard Holman, who are seeking to oust Mr Barrie Hoar as chairman and
Mr Robert Hoar as a director. Mr Barrie Hoar has said that he and his
brother 'would resign when the company's future is secure.'
Hoskins Brewery shares last changed hands at 56p on the Unlisted Securities
Market, valuing the group at Pounds 3.22m, before being suspended at the
company's request on May 27.
It is thought that Mr Hodgson will buy a large block of shares in Hoskins
from the Hoar brothers, who founded the company and own almost 30 per cent
of the shares.
A number of new non-executive directors are expected to join the Hoskins
board after the shares change hands. Mr Hodgson is then expected to embark
on an expansion programme via acquisitions.
Mr Hodgson built up the largest quoted funeral services company in the UK,
PFG Hodgson Kenyon International, during the 1970s and 1980s, transforming
his family business - which he bought for Pounds 14,000 - into a Pounds 100m
company, via a series of mergers and acquisitions.
He brought Hodgson Holdings to the Unlisted Securities Market in 1986. The
company obtained a full Stock Exchange listing in 1989, merging with Kenyon
Securities the same year to form PHKI. In 1987 he was voted USM Entrepreneur
of the Year.
His departure from the group in January 1991, following a profits warning
triggered, according to the company, by high gearing costs and a lower than
forecast UK mortality rate, was said to have been by mutual agreement and to
enable Mr Hodgson to pursue other interests outside the funeral services
industry.

FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Nouvelle to reconstruct for property
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOUVELLE, whose main business is now that of a property company and whose
shares have been suspended since the beginning of last December, plans a
reorganisation, placing, rights issue, acquisition and a change of name.
It is anticipated that suspension will be lifted on implementation of the
proposals, and dealings will start on September 14.
The group also released accounts for the year ended March 31 1993 showing a
significant cut in pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 219,000. The
discount stationery retailing subsidiary was sold in April 1992 and the
office products distribution operation disposed of in August. There were
extraordinary charges of Pounds 3.69m (Pounds 5.15m) for asset write downs
and other costs.
Losses per share were reduced from 3.1p to 0.28p.
After a capital reorganisation which includes cancellation of part of the
deficit on the profit and loss account, it is planned to raise Pounds
920,000 net through the placing of 11.2m new ordinary 1p shares at 5p
apiece; and shareholders are offered a like number of shares at the same
price on the basis of 1-for-10 ordinary and 1-for-2 convertible preference.
Nouvelle proposes to purchase Regent Corporation, and take that name. Regent
is a recently-established house building company of which Mr Carl Turpin and
Mr Christopher Johnson, two experienced property developers, are directors
and shareholders; they will join Nouvelle as chief executive and deputy
chairman respectively.
Maximum consideration is Pounds 500,000 and initial payment will be Pounds
100,000 settled via the issue of 2m ordinary shares, and up to a further 8m
shares depending on results for the period to March 31 1995.
Regent has two completed developments in Charlwood, Surrey, and Wandsworth,
London. It has bought land at North Cheam, London, with planning permission,
and exchanged contracts on a site in Sutton, Surrey.

FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: Fyffes chief executive quits to
'pursue other interests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN Callaghan, the chief executive of Fyffes, the fruit distribution
group, is to step down at the end of this month, having been in the post for
just over two years.
No reasons were given for his departure other than that, according to a
company statement, he intends to pursue 'other business interests'.
Mr Neil McCann, the group chairman, acknowledged Mr Callaghan's contribution
to the company saying that his management team had successfully handled the
group's transition to the EC single market.
Fyffes is a significant banana importer into the UK and Ireland, and under a
new EC quota system which was approved last July, now stands to benefit in
the wider EC market at the expense of the top 'dollar' producers such as
Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte.
Fyffes has, however, suffered a number of setbacks in the past two years in
its efforts to build a distribution base outside of the British Isles.
Having raised IPounds 60m in a rights issue in 1991, the group made a bid
for the Del Monte group, which was then in the hands of the Polly Peck
liquidator. A Mexican group, however, made the successful bid at a price
believed to be around Dollars 500m.
A IPounds 52m deal to buy a significant stake in the Swedish fruit
distribution group, Saba, was then aborted in the autumn of last year as the
ERM currency crisis caused interest rates to soar in both the Swedish and
Irish markets.
Earlier this year talks were held between Fyffes and Dole, on a possible
agreed takeover by Dole of the Irish-controlled group. It is thought that
the terms offered were not acceptable to controlling interests within the
Fyffes group, however, and Dole subsequently withdrew.
Reports in Dublin at the weekend suggested that it was tensions between Mr
McCann and Mr Callaghan over control of the company and how to spend its
IPounds 100m cash hoard, that have led to Mr Callaghan's departure. Company
sources have been unavailable for comment.
Mr Callaghan joined Fyffes from the accountancy firm KPMG Stokes Kennedy
Crowley, where he had been a managing partner for eight years.

FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: All fired-up to test the market - The
proposed flotation of the BSM Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British School of Motoring can probably claim to be the world's biggest.
The Red Army's school once came near it - but that now had other things to
do, joked Mr Paul Massey, chief executive of BSM Group, who confirmed on
Friday that the company would be floated in October.
The flotation aims to raise between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. Much of that
will be used to repay the Pounds 30m of debt incurred during a management
buy-out in 1990, led by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital Partners, which
owns 70 per cent.
BSM traces its history to the first days of the horseless carriage, claiming
that its first pupil in 1910 was a coachman threatened with the sack when
his employer traded in a coach and pair for a car. It also claims to have
taught the first person to pass the UK driving test after its introduction
in 1935 - a Mr Beene.
The school was acquired in 1973 by Sir Anthony Jacobs, whose family still
owns 20 per cent of the company. Sir Anthony decided to sell in 1990 when he
was ready to retire and his son wanted to pursue other interests. Mr
Massey's management team, which owns 10 per cent, held off rival offers from
car makers and leasing companies eager for such a large captive market.
Mr Massey holds 30 per cent of the management team's 10 per cent stake, and
will not be selling any of his shares in the flotation.
The school now operates 134 branches spread between Aberdeen and Plymouth.
It has 2,000 self-employed instructors, who pay a weekly franchise fee to
BSM.
Mr Richard Glover, managing director, said that teaching learner drivers
would remain the group's core business. More than 90 per cent of the
population is within easy reach of a BSM school, he claims, and the familiar
white pyramid on the roof of BSM cars is paraded through 1m miles of UK
roads every week.
BSM teaches 120,000 people to drive each year, and claims a market share of
15 per cent. However, the competition is very fragmented - the nearest in
size is the Automobile Association's operation - The Driving School - with
just over 500 franchised cars, and there is a multitude of one and
two-person businesses.
The market has been depressed for two to three years as the recession has
held back new learners, according to Mr John Lepine of the Motor Schools
Association. Also, demographically, the UK population of 17-year-olds is at
its lowest level since 1945.
This has a big effect as learners between the ages of 17 and 19 form 43 per
cent of the total, according to Transport Research Laboratory figures for
1992. Those aged between 20 and 24 make up a further 22 per cent.
In such conditions prices have been kept down. One small London school owner
said he had not raised the cost of an hourly lesson in the daytime from
Pounds 14 since June 1989.
BSM prices range between Pounds 14.95 an hour to Pounds 17.50 in central
London. As a rule of thumb, learning to drive takes 1 1/2 hours for every
year of someone's life, so that a person of 20 will need to spend Pounds 450
at Pounds 15 an hour to reach driving test level.
The company is now making more effort to attract the younger end of the
market. Only 30 per cent of its customers have been under 20. In July the
group switched from Rover Metros to Vauxhall Corsas, a car which BSM
believes will appeal more to teenagers. Vauxhall will supply the company
with 5,000 cars a year over 10 years in a Pounds 400m deal.
Mr Glover is also keen to expand the company's health and safety division
and MCR, which maintains the fleet. The health and safety arm provides
training to company car drivers. He claimed that BP's motor accident rate
had fallen by 58 per cent in the year after its drivers had undergone BSM
courses.
The company also sees good growth opportunities for MCR, which has started
to take on the maintenance of other company fleets.
Mr Massey described the recession as 'awful', but said the group still
managed to report operating profits of Pounds 4.1m on turnover of Pounds 21m
last year, and Pounds 2.2m on Pounds 11.8m in the first half of this year.

FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: English &amp; Scottish asset value jumps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of July the net asset value per share of English &amp; Scottish
Investors stood at 118.6p.
This showed a signifi-cant advance on previous levels. At January 31 1993 it
came to 106.7p and six months prior to that it was 81.6p.
In the half year ended July 31 1993 gross income improved from Pounds 3.3m
to Pounds 3.62m. Net revenue, however, fell from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds
939,000, mainly because of higher interest charges.
Earnings per share dropped to 0.57p (0.74p) but the in-terim dividend is
maintained at 0.5p, payable on October 19.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Irish explorer heads for Siberian wastes: Why a big Russian
trader has invested in a tiny oil company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Sarukhanov has become a familiar figure in the prosperous Kent
village of Seal, thousands of miles from his usual stamping ground, the
desolate oil fields of Siberia.
He has just forged a unique partnership between Aminex, a small quoted Irish
oil company managed in the UK, and Zarubezhneftj, the Russian state-owned
oil equipment trading company which had a monopoly position until the break
up of the Soviet Union.
As a result of this deal, Aminex, a company with a market capitalisation of
only Pounds 11m, has apparently won access to the vast oil producing
potential of the former Soviet Union.
Mr Sarukhanov, a 44-year-old petroleum engineer and the deputy director
general of Zarubezhneftj, recently accepted a seat on the board of Aminex,
which is listed on the Irish Exploration Securities Market, Ireland's
equivalent of the old London Third Market.
His appointment follows the purchase of 35 per cent of Aminex by East West
Oil, which is based in Seal and is jointly owned by Zarubezhneftj and Titan
Assets, a UK company with Russian shareholders also based in Seal.
The deal which brought Mr Sarukhanov to the Aminex table has raised
considerable interest in the industry - both enthusiastic and sceptical.
Russia's potential is widely acknowledged. Five years ago, the then Soviet
Union was producing almost 13m barrels of oil and equivalent products a day,
61 per cent more than the whole of North America. But the industry is now
suffering a chronic lack of investment and equipment and production has
halved.
Many larger western companies, though scenting vast opportunities, are
reluctant to plunge into a country rife with political uncertainty and
economic chaos.
Aminex, by working with Zarubezhneftj, may have eliminated some of the
uncertainties which plague western companies in Russia. Mr Sarukhanov, with
more than 20 years' experience of working in government circles, is expected
to bring real returns in a matter of months by clinching a deal for Aminex
to revive some of the 30,000 neglected oil wells languishing in Siberia.
Zarubezhneftj's close ties to the government and long experience overseas
make it a useful partner for a venture in bureaucratic and unpredictable
Russia. It is used to working with foreign companies, having been the body
through which the Ministry of Fuel and Energy imported and exported all of
its oil equipment. It was also the government's arm for setting up, running
and supplying foreign joint ventures in oil in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and, most
recently, Vietnam.
At its peak five years ago, Zarubezhneftj boasted turnover of Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) a year. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, and
the growing independence of Russian oil producers, turnover has fallen to
between Dollars 300m to Dollars 500m.
Zarubezhneftj's interest in a tiddler such as Aminex is difficult for many
to understand - but not Mr Sarukhanov. 'We are allowed, and it is our duty,
to reinvest money back into Russian industry,' he says.
A deal such as the one with Aminex - which he describes as 'small enough and
at the same time with potential enough' - will 'increase possibilities to do
something in Russia'. He continues: 'We hope it is the proper choice. We
will see.' He points out that Zarubezhneftj must also seek 'more commercial'
opportunities if it is to survive as a privatised entity.
Zarubezhneftj will also be able to use Aminex to help Russian producers
negotiate the unfamiliar world of western companies and markets.
Aminex's relatively small size may in itself be an advantage in Russia. Many
larger companies are regarded with suspicion there. 'Russia is a
relationship country,' says one industry executive with considerable
experience in the region. The majors, he says, have singularly failed to
build personal relationships.
'The big shots only go in to sign agreements and then go away again,' he
says. 'Small companies can often do things that appear much bigger than they
would normally be capable of because of personal relationships.'
Oil industry participants have their own ideas about why Zarubezhneftj
should choose such a small and insignificant partner. Although the board
which rescued Aminex from collapse in its previous incarnation as Eglinton
Exploration has experience of the oil industry, it has no expertise in
Russia.
An analyst specialising in the Russian oil industry says that Aminex may
provide a useful hard currency earner for its Russian shareholders,
particularly if they can ensure that Aminex gets the best quality oil.
The Russian investment in Aminex has been made through a complex web of
companies. East West Oil has bought 35 per cent. The 35 per cent stake was
purchased at an average price of about 18p per share, against Friday's close
of 45p.
East West in turn is 50 per cent owned by Zarubezhneftj, with the rest held
by Titan Assets, whose ultimate owners are hidden behind nominees, which
hold 83 per cent of it.
One of Titan's directors is Mr Andrei Gloriozov who is also deputy chairman
of Imperial Bank of Russia, the young and aggressive Moscow bank. It is
believed that IBR gets much of its money through trading oil and is closely
linked to the highest echelons of Russian government.
Mr Gloriozov is also a director of Titan Oil &amp; Metals, one of the original
investors in IBR, and runs IBR's Luxembourg bank, East West Bank. Titan
Assets says, however, that IBR has no direct interests in East West Oil
although there is a business relationship.
Oil industry executives say it makes sense for both parties to start tapping
Russian potential by rehabilitating shut-in wells. 'It is an inexpensive way
to get your feet wet,' he says.
However, with the Russian oil producers increasingly calling the shots, even
an organisation with the financial muscle and political power of
Zarubezhneftj may find trying anything more than rehabilitation too
difficult at first.
Mr Robin McFarlane, who owns 17 per cent of Titan Assets and is a director
of East West Oil, is emphatic about his plans for Aminex. 'We want to build
it into a significant force,' he says. However, he and Mr Sarukhanov agree
that such plans will take some time.

FT  23 AUG 93 / British Gas may opt for demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS's shareholders may be given shares in a new gas trading company,
if the government forces the utility to adopt the recommendations of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission that its trading business be divested.
Mr Philip Rogerson, the group's finance director, said such a demerger was
the most likely option, though British Gas had yet to carry out a detailed
feasibility study. 'Other possibilities are a trade sale or a flotation to
raise cash,' he said.
He said the company would probably carry out any divestment much earlier
than the MMC's deadline of the end of March 1997, provided this did not
impose excessive costs.
However no decisions will be taken until after the company holds
negotiations with the government. These are not expected before September 6.
Mr Rogerson expected Schroders, the merchant bank, would advise the company
on the divestment strategy. Schroders advised British Gas on its submission
to the MMC enquiry, whose conclusions were published last week.
Other MMC proposals were that British Gas's monopoly over gas supply should
be reduced in 1997 and removed no more than five years later. It also
recommended a change in the pricing formula for household customers and said
the company's pipelines should earn a return on assets of 4 to 4.5 per cent.
Consumer groups have warned that implementation of the proposals could lead
to higher prices. The company said they would lead to the loss of at least
20,000 jobs.

<TEXT>
MERRILL LYNCH, the largest securities house in the US, is to submit a formal
application to the Bank of England to become a gilt-edged marketmaker, or
dealer in UK government bonds.
Merrill was one of several foreign houses to pull out of the gilt market in
the late 1980s in the face of tough competition in an overcrowded market and
is likely to be the first of these to return.
It plans to make its application in the next few weeks. While the Bank
refuses to comment on individual applications, it has indicated it is
willing to grant the status to those houses prepared to make a long term
gilt market commitment.
The two-year rally in the UK government bond market has helped many to
return to profit. Yamaichi International (Europe), the European arm of the
Japanese securities houses, has also applied to operate as a marketmaker and
is expected to obtain permission this autumn. This will bring the total
number of marketmakers to 20.
Merrill has hired Mr Stephen Rumsey, a veteran of the gilts market, to
develop its sterling fixed income business: he joined the company's London
office last week as a managing director in the debt markets business group.
Mr Rumsey, 42, has been involved in the gilt-edged and Eurosterling markets
for the past 21 years. Until recently he was chief executive of BZW's bond
operations; he spent eight years at BZW, initially working in the gilts and
Eurosterling sector, and later heading its fixed income operations.
A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said Mr Rumsey 'would be involved in some
business initiatives in the debt markets area, but it is premature to
announce these in detail'.
However, it is understood that Mr Rumsey will be developing Merrill's
sterling business at a time when the UK government's hefty borrowing
requirement is helping marketmakers to generate record profits. Marketmakers
made post-tax profits of Pounds 65m between them last year, according to the
Bank of England.
Earlier this summer, Merrill hired Mr Ifty Islam, BZW's gilt strategist.
Since Big Bang in October 1986, 12 marketmakers have pulled out, either
because the business was no longer profitable or because they were taken
over by another house.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Potential losses of LUI could be Pounds 4.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL LOSSES of London United Investments, the insurance group which
collapsed early in 1990, could be as high as Pounds 4.5bn, more than Pounds
1bn greater than earlier estimates.
The estimated shortfall between liabilities and assets will be disclosed
when provisional liquidators publish a scheme of arrangement next week.
The full extent of the losses cannot yet be accurately assessed, as they
depend on claims that could take years to settle. LUI was heavily involved
in 'long tail' US liability business, in which claims often arise years
after the policy is written.
LUI's subsidiaries specialised in general and product liability for North
American companies, with professional indemnity insurance for accountants,
architects, engineers and lawyers, and medical malpractice insurance for
doctors and hospitals.
The provisional liquidators, Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, will seek creditors' approval for a scheme of arrangement rather
than a liquidation, because they believe it offers the best prospects for
the companies' creditors, which could eventually number more than 100,000.
The scheme of arrangement allows creditors to receive some payment before
the detailed picture of the assets and liabilities is fully known.
Part of the impact of the LUI losses will be absorbed by the Policyholders'
Protection Board, which could be faced with a bill of more than Pounds 250m.
The PPB, which is financed by a levy on other UK insurers, covers 90 per
cent of all claims from private policyholders when UK insurers go out of
business.
The PPB's potential bill has risen because of a recent House of Lords ruling
which found that several thousand US policyholders could claim compensation
even though they were not resident in the UK. But it reserved judgment on
whether a number of professional partnerships would be eligible.
LUI incurred its liabilities through its subsidiaries, Kingscroft Insurance,
Walbrook Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual
Reinsurance.
In November 1990, the Department of Trade and Industry launched an
investigation into LUI under Section 432 of the Companies Act.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: Milan market defies gloom from Rome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid booming international bourses, Milan, once a sluggard, has been up with
the pace setters. Shares in Italy have risen by 35 per cent this year, one
of the sharpest increases of any of the main markets.
Yet unlike the rises in London and New York, the boom in Italian stocks
seems remote from economic fundamentals. Share prices have moved in almost
inverse proportion to the gloominess of recent economic news from Rome, and
if current business data guided the indices, stocks would be sliding, not
soaring.
Industrial output and employment have both fallen sharply this year. Jobless
totals have hit almost 3m - a national average of 12 per cent. But that
masks an unemployment rate of 21.3 per cent in the depressed south - nearly
three times the 7.9 per cent prevailing in the centre and the north.
Industrial production dropped by 1.3 per cent in June compared with the
previous month. After stabilising in the first quarter, output for the
second quarter was 1.2 per cent below that in the first three months of the
year, while the first half was 4.2 per cent down on the same period of 1992.
The figures have prompted dire warnings about lengthening dole queues when
Italy's big factories reopen at the end of the August holidays. The number
of workers in government-backed short-time working or redundancy schemes has
already soared 35 per cent in the first five months of this year against the
same period of 1992. 'The surge in unemployment suggests that consumers are
unlikely to step up spending soon,' says the US bank J P Morgan in Milan.
The downturn has been most acute in the motor industry. Car sales have
slumped by about 26 per cent this year - one of the sharpest falls on
record.
The plunge, steeper than that in either France or Germany, makes depressing
reading for Fiat executives, putting the final touches to next month's press
launch of the new Punto small car. While one set of spokesmen prepares for
the huge beanfeast in Fiat's home town of Turin, others are having to
explain why up to 38,000 workers will be on short-time working in September.
The theory is that the lower lira should promote an export boom to
compensate for the domestic turndown. On paper, the argument looks
convincing. The lira closed on Friday about 23 per cent below last
September's pre-flotation parity against the D-Mark. At its weakest earlier
this year, when one D-Mark was worth almost L1,000, the devaluation was more
than 30 per cent.
The flaw in the argument is the recession abroad. 'The lira may be weak, but
what's the point when your neighbours don't want to spend any money,' says
one bank economist.
While exports have risen, they have hardly boomed. The overall customs trade
surplus in the first five months of the year was L5,700bn (Pounds 2.37bn),
against a L2,800bn deficit in the same period of last year. However,
analysis of this year's figures is complicated by changes in the European
Community's methods of collecting data because of the single market.
According to J P Morgan, imports in the first quarter appear to have been
understated while the surge in exports is expected to have moderated in the
second.
The gloomy economic climate has hit Italy's banks, which have warned of much
higher provisions this year after the already substantial allowances made
last year.
The problems at Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company, staggering
under total borrowings of L28,838bn, have captured the limelight. But the
Ferruzzi crisis is just the most acute in a string of corporate rescues.
Recent figures from the Bank of Italy show that problem loans by commercial
banks rose to L42,016bn at the end of May from L37,428bn last December and
L32,613bn at the end of 1991. Special credit institutions, which concentrate
on medium and long-term industrial lending, have also suffered, with a 21
per cent rise in problem loans to L17,835bn at the end of May compared with
December 1991.
There has been a trickle of brighter news. Inflation, though edging upwards
recently, remained at an acceptable 4.4 per cent in July.
Meanwhile, real wage costs have dropped appreciably. The process began with
last year's landmark union-employer agreement to abolish the scala mobile
wage indexation system. An additional accord last month created a new wage
bargaining system, designed to prevent the recurrence of inflationary wage
settlements. However, it will be some time before the benefits come through
in terms of more jobs.
Moderate inflation and falling wage costs have encouraged the Bank of Italy
to cut interest rates, along with parliamentary progress in passing the
government's latest budget plans. The central bank slashed the discount rate
by 1 percentage point to 9 per cent in July, the lowest level since 1976.
However, it is the government, rather than business, which has been the main
beneficiary of lower interest rates so far. While yields on treasury bills
have virtually halved since last September, business people are still
complaining that bank lending rates have not fallen so far or so fast.
Facing big provisions, the banks seem determined to widen their margins.
The drop in interest rates has come as a tonic for the budget deficit.
Combined with a 9.3 per cent rise in tax receipts in the first half, lower
rates on government bonds should help the government meet its
deficit-reduction plans. Its target is to stabilise the ratio between debt
and gross domestic product - rising inevitably because of the recession - at
123 per cent by 1996, compared with 109 per cent last year. The deficit is
expected to be around L150,000bn this year.
In time, action to prune the deficit and reduce interest charges should rub
off on business confidence. Already the booming bourse suggests that
investors are focusing more on the government budgetary outlook than on
gloomier corporate news.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Rates and rafting in the Rockies: Monetary officials focus
on financial innovation at Wyoming talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL BANKERS and financial market 'speculators' called a truce this
weekend when they gathered at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for white-water
rafting, western barbecues and breakfast trail rides, writes Michael Prowse.
Senior monetary officials spoke of the need to enlist markets as 'friends
rather than enemies'. Referring to the effective collapse of the exchange
rate mechanism, Mr Michael Mussa, research director at the International
Monetary Fund, quoted Shakespeare: 'The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our
stars but in ourselves.'
Leading financial market analysts, meanwhile, complimented the US Federal
Reserve on its adroit handling of monetary policy, which had struck exactly
the right balance between the risks of recession and inflation.
The excuse for the frolics was the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's
annual monetary symposium, one of the most popular conferences on the
international circuit because of its all-star cast and spectacular location
high up in the Rockies.
Some notables dropped out at the last moment. Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury
undersecretary, stayed in Washington to mastermind attempts to halt the
dollar's long slide against the yen.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, sent a detailed
statement contradicting most of the views of his American hosts, but stayed
away.
European participants focused mainly on the role that speculative capital
flows played in helping undermine the ERM. Many seemed convinced that fixed
but adjustable systems such as the old ERM were no longer feasible: logic
dictated either freely floating or irrevocably fixed rates. A gradual
approach to eventual monetary union was no longer possible.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, urged ERM members to
consider reforms based on Israel's innovative approach to currency
management. Israel allowed its exchange rate to fluctuate in a narrow band
around a central parity which is adjusted regularly to reflect the
difference between the targeted inflation rate in Israel and that expected
in its main trading partners. This compromise had allowed Israel to maintain
steady downward pressure on inflation while sustaining robust economic
growth.
Americans were mainly preoccupied by the effect of financial innovation in
destabilising capital markets and the economy. Particularly worrying was a
sharp decline in the market share of commercial banks and a corresponding
surge in personal holdings of risky assets such as stock and bond mutual
funds and pension fund assets - which now account for 32 per cent of
household assets, double the ratio in 1980.
Mr Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street analyst, argued that households' increased
exposure to financial risk meant consumer spending, hitherto stable, could
become much more volatile, greatly complicating efforts of policy-makers to
smooth economic fluctuations.
Others noted that no lender of last resort facilities existed to counter the
equivalent of 'bank runs' affecting these risky household assets.
Mr Robert Johnson, of financier George Soros's fund management group, said
the biggest systemic risk over the next five to seven years lay in the
possibility of defaults on government issued bonds. Depressed economic
conditions were leading many governments to compensate for tight monetary
policies by running 'excessively loose fiscal policies'. Yet bond investors
seemed oblivious of the dangers.
There was sharp disagreement about conduct of monetary policy. Most
Americans agreed that financial innovations had destroyed the credibility of
monetary targets and made ad hoc policies, involving reliance on a broad
array of indicators, inevitable.
Mr Tietmeyer, however, said in prepared remarks that money supply targets
still worked well in Germany and would not be dropped. He noted that the
Bundesbank, unlike Anglo-Saxon central banks, had suppressed financial
innovations likely to destabilise monetary policy.

FT  23 AUG 93 / BAe in talks with Taiwan over proposed Pounds 250m joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, is expected to hold a series
of meetings today with Taiwanese politicians, bankers and industrialists in
an attempt to resolve outstanding differences over a proposed Pounds 250m
joint venture to build passenger aircraft.
Senior officials of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, BAe's partner in the
proposed venture, confirmed yesterday that talks with Mr Cahill would
concentrate on bank financing of the deal.
The joint venture, called Avro, is a pillar of Mr Cahill's recovery strategy
for BAe. The range of regional jets that would be partly manufactured in
Taiwan currently loses money for BAe.
For Taiwan, the project would provide a rapid route to understanding western
aerospace technology and techniques of aircraft financing, such as leases.
Discussions between Mr Cahill's team and the Taiwanese would centre on
'differences in banking laws between the UK and Taiwan', said a senior
vice-president of TAC.
These relate to the nature of Avro's collateral against loans from Taiwanese
banks. The state-owned Chiao Tung bank, which is leading the lending
consortium, will have a significant stake in Avro. But Taiwanese banking law
prohibits any bank from making unsecured loans to a company in which it has
more than a 3 per cent stake. It is unclear if Avro's assets - BAe property,
plant and equipment in the UK - qualify as collateral.
A deal to establish the joint venture was signed in January by Mr Cahill and
Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president. Since then, both companies have laboured to
finalise the arrangements, sometimes against scepticism from Taiwanese
banking officials who question the sales potential of the aircraft.
Further details of how Avro would be managed also emerged yesterday. The aim
of the venture is to produce a new passenger jet aircraft with two engines
rather than the four on BAe's existing regional jet aircraft, the RJ series.
TAC regards modern engines as reliable enough for a twin-engined aircraft to
operate from the remote regions for which the RJ series and its predecessor,
the 146, were designed.
The new aircraft, the RJ-X, would be 25 per cent built in Taiwan and 25 per
cent in the UK. The remainder - wings, engines and avionics - would be built
by US companies.
Until the RJ-X enters production towards the end of the decade, Taiwan would
concentrate on final assembly and fuselage construction of existing RJ
series models.
Initial markets for both new and existing aircraft types would be Taiwan's
domestic airlines, with which TAC is 'well connected', said the TAC senior
vice-president.
Other potential markets are the fast-growing regions of south-east Asia and
China. Chinese airlines already have 17 BAe 146s. A crash in China on July
23 is still under investigation.

FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo's accumulation of a large cash pile may look odd for a company with
such declared faith in the future of research. The impending legal judgment
on the validity of the US patent for Zantac, the world's biggest-selling
drug which accounts for about two-thirds of Glaxo's profits, may be a
partial explanation. The derating of earnings from Zantac ahead of the court
case has certainly contributed to the weakness of the shares, which now
account for 4 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index, down from 7 per cent at the
peak.
If Zantac is open to generic competition, sales and profits would be quickly
eroded. While a Pounds 1.5bn cash pile looks excessive by most standards,
the group's research effort would consume as much within three years. That
would be a valuable breathing space should the worst happen. If Zantac's
future is secured, though, adding to the cash pile will be more difficult to
justify.
An acquisition outside ethical pharmaceuticals has been ruled out. The
choice is thus between ploughing more into research - directly or by
acquisitions in, say, biotechnology - or distributing more to shareholders.
The dilemma is by no means unique to Glaxo. In the short term other drugs
companies can legitimately argue that cash is an advantage as the industry
restructures. Merck's acquisition of Medco, the drugs distributor, is a case
in point. But if earnings growth from pharmaceuticals is going to be lower
than in the past, the case for providing higher investment returns by way of
yield is compelling.

FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is a pleasant enough place for Federal Reserve
governors to spend a weekend ruminating on the prospects for the US economy.
Given the forces currently at work on the US economy, however, Tokyo or
Paris might have been more relevant places to meet. The US has happily
watched the yen appreciate all year, presumably on the theory that this will
put pressure on Japanese exports and force the Japanese to reflate their
economy. Yet that is to reckon without the scarring experience of the bubble
economy, the caution of the new government or the shift of Japanese
manufacturing into other Pacific rim economies with currencies linked to the
dollar.
The weakness of US exports to Europe is another reason to suppose that the
Federal Reserve cannot rely on export strength to power the US recovery. The
dollar has hardly gained a competitive edge against European currencies this
year, and continental European demand remains very weak.
Admittedly, with expectations of US growth slowing, monetary aggregates
hardly suggesting a strong upturn, and the budget deal adding to tax bills,
Fed governors have plenty of domestic problems to address. The rally in the
Treasury bond market suggests that inflation offers no sustained threat, and
the Fed may have questioned its bias towards raising interest rates at last
week's Open Market Committee meeting. That leaves the stock market caught
between an inflow of funds, and the fading prospect that earnings increases
will be fuelled by sales growth rather than cost-cutting.

FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: German chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The disintegration of the ERM could hardly have come at a worse time for the
German chemicals industry. Petrochemicals are blighted by overcapacity,
agrochemicals are in decline thanks to reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy, and pharmaceuticals are being depressed by government reforms - most
notably in Germany itself. These factors matter in different measure to the
German chemicals giants: BASF is most geared to bulk chemicals, Bayer to
pharmaceuticals. The depreciation of other European currencies against the
D-Mark is painful for all.
The half-year results season is unlikely, then, to bring much cheer. The big
gains would come from a rise in commodity chemicals prices from the current
depressed levels. Tentative price rises seen earlier this year fell back
with the oil price. With industrial demand for plastics weak and fresh
capacity still coming on stream - BASF's Antwerp petrochemical complex is
scheduled to open at the end of the year - any sustained improvement looks
some way off. This autumn's round of contract negotiations is unlikely to
provide relief.
Still, the trend towards asset swaps and joint ventures is encouraging.
Hoechst's recent merger of its agrochemicals interest with Schering and
BASF's proposed acrylic for polypropylene swap with ICI might open the way
for more rationalisation and cost-cutting than has been in evidence until
now. While the currency markets are working against them, though, it will
take more of the same to restore the competitive position of the German
chemicals industry.

FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Mirror in the frame
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The administrators who control 55 per cent of Mirror Group Newspapers'
shares will be furiously puzzling about when to dispose of their stake. They
must be happy enough with management's ferocious assault on MGN's costs and
the progress of its shares. But they are not long-term shareholders. And a
surging stock market, a series of suspiciously upbeat stockbrokers'
circulars and a sprightly set of interim results next month could prove an
irresistible temptation to sell.
The counter argument is that nothing will be lost by waiting. Indeed, MGN's
shares should be worth considerably more next year. The company's aggressive
management is steadily improving earnings. Any pick-up in advertising
volumes adds that splash of recovery appeal. But at some point the market
will switch its focus from the short-term profits bounce to the long-term
sales trend. Here, the outlook is far less rosy. Tabloid newspaper sales are
in decline. The Daily Mirror's circulation has fallen 40 per cent over the
past 30 years. News International has recently added to the pressure by
cutting The Sun's cover price to 20p. Although this does not appear to have
damaged MGN greatly, it must have ruled out any price rises for a while.
Meanwhile, the possible imposition of value-added tax on newspapers in the
November Budget threatens margins. Cyclically depressed newsprint prices
have only one way to move. On the basis that it is better to travel
hopefully than to arrive, the administrators may well conclude that this
autumn would be a good time to sell.

FT  23 AUG 93 / High stakes test of patience: The holiday is over for the
French government, as it tackles unemployment and recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The holidays are over for Mr Edouard Balladur and his government. The French
prime minister has returned to Paris from his vacation home in Chamonix in
the French Alps to launch what he has described as a new phase in the action
of the administration.
This new phase will be mapped out today in a cabinet meeting. It will
determine the course of the Balladur government, which faces increasing
pressure to resolve France's unemployment problem and to revive the
recession-hit economy.
The risk for the prime minister is that, for the French public and for
members of his Gaullist RPR party, his new phase may not seem new enough.
With presidential elections due in 1995, his continued commitment to
anti-inflationary policies and to the maintenance of a strong franc may test
their patience.
Mr Balladur's next steps will centre on a series of structural reforms. At
the top of the agenda is the fight against unemployment, which currently
stands at a rate of 11.6 per cent of the workforce and is forecast by Insee,
the national statistics institute, to rise to 12.5 per cent by the end of
the year.
The government's response is a five-year plan to create jobs, unveiled last
week by Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister. The principal elements
include:
The transfer of social security charges from employers to the government for
families of workers earning up to 1.5 times the minimum wage. The measure is
intended to reduce the costs facing employers and to encourage them to
increase their workforces.
The replacement of the 39-hour working week with an equivalent hourly total
for the year. This is designed to increase the flexibility of production by
allowing companies to work longer in any one week and to reduce overtime
payments.
Exemptions for employers from payment of social security taxes for up to
five years for the first three extra workers they hire.
The labour market reforms are to be combined with a fiscal stimulus aimed at
reviving consumer demand. This is expected to involve a cut in income taxes.
In a television interview earlier this month Mr Balladur said that a reform
of the income tax system, which he described as one of the most complex in
the world, should 'permit the middle classes and those with average salaries
to have their charges reduced'.
Government spending is also being raised in an attempt to revive the
economy. The proceeds of the 'Balladur bond' issue, which raised about
FFr110bn (Pounds 12.5bn), three times more than the target amount, will be
used to fund public works and construction projects. As with the income tax
reforms, details of the spending plans will be outlined in the budget for
next year, to be presented to the National Assembly in the autumn.
The various measures are, however, unlikely to have a rapid impact on
unemployment. The job creation schemes are a medium-term plan rather than a
short-term stimulus and leave untouched the controversial minimum wage
level.
The minimum wage, or Smic, currently stands at FFr5,880 a month and is
regarded by French industrialists as one of the principal obstacles to
increased employment. 'It sets an expensive floor for hiring workers,' said
the finance director of one manufacturing company.
Mr Balladur appears to have ruled out reform of Smic on political grounds.
'I will not take responsibility under the pretext of fighting a crisis for
destroying the system of social protection in our country,' he said this
month.
Despite his reluctance to undermine France's social security system, trade
unions have reacted angrily to the plans. The general-secretary of the CGT,
one of the largest union groups, echoed counterparts in describing the
proposals as 'one of the most serious aggressions to be launched against
workers'.
The limits of the plan and the fact it is to be implemented over five years
mean that unemployment is expected to rise further. 'He is right to focus on
the structural problems of the labour market in France,' said one French
economist, 'but I don't think we are likely to see any stabilisation in
unemployment until the first half of next year.'
The fiscal measures are also constrained. Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief
economist at Salomon Brothers, the merchant bank, estimates the government's
budget deficit target of FFr317bn this year is unlikely to be achieved, and
forecasts a shortfall of about FFr350bn. The scope for cutting taxes and
stimulating growth is consequently limited.
That leaves monetary policy as the remaining means to stimulate the economy.
But since the effective collapse of the ERM at the beginning of the month,
which widened the franc's fluctuation bands within the exchange rate
mechanism from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent, the Bank of France has followed
a step-by-step approach to reducing borrowing costs.
This cautious reduction of interest rates is partly a reflection of Mr
Balladur's commitment to a strong franc. But it also reflects determination
to preserve the process of European union, despite the damage sustained by
the ERM.
Mr Balladur will meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on Thursday and is
expected to emphasise France's commitment to the existing timetable for
European monetary union which calls for a single currency to be introduced
by 1997 or 1999 at the latest. He may also discuss the prospects for a
return to tighter exchange-rate fluctuation bands and reform of the ERM
rules to increase co-operation between ERM members in support of their
respective currencies.
Mr Balludur's German hosts would probably resist such a reform, but they
might make the French prime minster's journey easier by announcing a cut in
interest rates. Even without one, France would appear to have some rom for
manoeuvre on cutting borrowing costs. The franc has responded well to the
recent cuts in the 24-hour rate (the overnight lending rate to commercial
banks), and stands at less than 3 per cent below its previous ERM floor rate
of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark. But the new exchange rate framework remains
fragile and French monetary officials reject any swift downward move.
The constraints on fiscal and monetary policy suggest there is little reason
to expect a rapid economic upturn. Mr Mercier at Salomon Brothers, in common
with most private-sector economists, predicts a contraction of gross
domestic product of about 1.5 per cent this year, a view which is supported
by French business. A survey this month by Insee found that industrialists
do not expect demand to recover until the fourth quarter of the year; they
expect to continue to reduce staff levels.
This all adds up to a dilemma for the French prime minister. Continued
recession risks erosion of support for his conservative government. A change
of tack risks the loss of credibility. The challenge he faces is to contain
pressures for change while the economy stabilises.
So far, the debate concerning a move to a British-style policy of
devaluation and rapid interest rate cuts has been limited to the press. A
letter in Liberation, the French daily, signed by a group of French bankers,
condemned 'the ayatollahs of the strong franc' who, they said, had failed to
respond to the failure of the ERM and to adopt a more expansionary policy.
The problem for Mr Balladur is that such views are not confined to business
but are heard even within his own party. Mr Philippe Seguin, president of
the National Assembly, is a longstanding advocate of devaluation and
expansionary policies. Mr Jacques Chirac, the leader of the RPR who has his
eyes on the presidency in 1995, is also thought to favour a more
growth-orientated economic policy.
Responding to the outcome of the ERM crisis, Mr Chirac said: 'France has
found again in the management of its economy the freedom it needs to fight
for jobs.'
No one is yet prepared openly to challenge the prime minister. Splits within
the ruling RPR-UDF coalition would be damaging in the run-up to presidential
elections as demonstrated by the failure of the right to unite in 1981 and
1988, which handed consecutive victories to the Socialists.
But with politicians returning from the summer break, with the trade union
movement showing signs of unity in the face of the planned labour market
reforms and with a new influx of students about to attempt to enter the
depressed labour market, the pressures for change are likely to increase.
Mr Balladur, with an approval rating of more than 50 per cent in opinion
polls, remains the most popular prime minister in postwar France. His
ability to ride the challenges expected in the autumn will determine whether
the political honeymoon, like the holiday season, is drawing to a close.

Jacques Attali is no longer president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development but tales continue to surface about his
high-handed approach to business life. Take the saga of how Attali lost his
own battle of Trafalgar despite having superior firepower on his side.
Early on in the EBRD's long campaign to find the right sort of London
headquarters, Attali set his sights on a newly refurbished property
overlooking Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square. Called Grand Buildings,
appropriately enough, it was next door to Whitehall, parliament and the
City, not to mention the West End.
Unfortunately, the building was occupied by Enterprise Oil and when Attali
broached the subject of whether the company might like to serve its country
by moving out, he got a polite refusal. Attali did not give up and in a
fairly short space of time Enterprise had been contacted by Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild, the Bank of England and Number 10 Downing Street.
However, Enterprise refused to budge and eventually Attali sailed away in
search of easier targets. Given that Elf Aquitaine, France's biggest
state-owned company, is Enterprise's biggest shareholder, the company's
bravery in the face of such odds would have deserved a mention in dispatches
in Nelson's time.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Roche the video
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Talking of stockbroking analysts who fancy themselves as media stars, has
anyone caught the latest edition of The Roche Report on the Ukraine?
Morgan Stanley strategist David Roche has made a video of himself talking to
the top nobs in the Ukraine and the people on the streets, titled 'Ukraine:
the big, the bad and the beautiful.'
Roche says that it is part of an effort to 'embrace the multi-media
technology' which will be available to information consumers in the next
five years. In fact, the reason is much more down to earth. Britain's ITN,
which is a bit strapped for cash, used Roche to front a report from Moscow
last year, part of which went out on News at 10. It offered to pick up the
cost of filming his Ukraine visit in return for a few free sound bites.

Smith New Court obviously likes the sound of Chiltern Radio. The firm's
latest research on Chiltern, called 'The only way is up', carries the
immortal line 'the shares have fallen by over 100 per cent in the last year
and now look cheap'. Perhaps the offending analyst should follow the example
of Capital Radio's David Jensen, whose photo adorns the report, and seek
alternative work as a disc jockey. He would be guaranteed a better

Watch out for young John Monks, the TUC's new general secretary. The wraps
are already being taken off the man who has been given the thankless task of
dragging Britain's trade union movement in from the cold.
Anna Ford gave Monks a chance to show his paces on BBC breakfast TV
yesterday and Observer hears that Monks will give the keynote speech at next
month's Trades Union Congress. The TUC has had to bend its hallowed rules
since Monks does not take over officially from Norman Willis until the end
of Congress on the Friday. Traditionally, the new general secretary has to
wait a further year to speak to the delegates.
But union leaders have had enough of the barren Willis years and can't wait
to hear a new voice at the head of the TUC.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Mine's a conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How 68-year-old Colin Draper, former boss of Thomas Tilling in the US, got
involved with his latest venture is one of those tales which will be better
understood in the bar of the local golf club than in the City of London.
Draper, who was awarded a CBE for his work in improving Anglo-American
commercial links, wanted to return to England after 17 years in the US. At
the same time an old colleague, Arthur Slater who once ran Tilcon, had a
problem. He and a group of wealthy Britons owned a country club in the
Portuguese Algarve which they wanted to develop.
If only the project could be linked to their other private interests with
strong cash flows, they would have a bankable project. A few dry sherries
later and they had a conglomerate with interests ranging from a 50 per cent
stake in a Siberian coal venture, to a hand gun manufacturer and the rights,
in perpetuity, to stage the European Open golf championship. All that was
lacking was management and a share quote.
Enter Draper, followed by Ross Perot henchman Richard Poulden, 42, and
Barbara Cartland's son Ian McCorquodale, 55, who is chairman of Debrett's
Peerage. They will run the show after the European investors have injected
their Dollars 250m of assets into Colorado's Caspen Oil in return for 175m
shares. The headquarters will move to London and, hey presto, a tiny,
loss-making oil company will be transformed into an acquisitive
international conglomerate.
A lot will depend on Caspen's projected strong cash flow living up to
expectations. But the promoters have high hopes for their Russian venture,
in particular. When the five coal washers have been bought and installed,
Caspen has been guaranteed total profits of Dollars 21m a year for five
years.
It sounds like the sort of idea that Lord White, Hanson's 70-year-old US
chief, might have thought up before he joined the establishment. Even so, it
seems a jolly complicated way of financing a golf club in Portugal.

<TEXT>
PETER SUTHERLAND took over as director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade less than two months ago. But already he has injected
urgency into efforts to complete the Uruguay round of multilateral trade
negotiations by the end of the year. This was badly needed. But it will not
be enough on its own. Also required is political commitment at the highest
level. Failing that, what must surely be the last of the Uruguay round's
many lives will be thrown away.
The director general's strategy has been in three parts. The first has been
increased pressure on the negotiators. On July 28, the Uruguay Round trade
negotiations committee (TNC) agreed an ambitious work programme, proposed by
Mr Sutherland, which should keep its members busy until mid-October. As he
remarked, 'leaving problems for the eleventh hour is a recipe for failure.
If we are to succeed in December, the eleventh hour is now.'
The timetable is necessarily ambitious, because much remains to be resolved.
Mr Sutherland stressed, for example, the importance of 'using the month of
August to receive instructions from capitals, to maintain the pace of
bilateral exchanges of offers and to bring renewed expertise and flexibility
to the negotiations in early September.' The TNC is to reconvene on August
31, with the succeeding six weeks used to make progress on all aspects of
market access before multilateralising the discussions in late October.
Principal benefit
This is an almost heroically tight timetable. To make it look feasible, Mr
Sutherland has also turned his hand to propaganda. The secretariat has
produced two short reports, to remind politicians and the wider public of
the costs of protection. The increase in imports that governments are
accustomed to view as the cost of a trade deal is in fact its principal
benefit. Meanwhile, protection forces what are often relatively poor
consumers to subsidise bad jobs at the cost of better ones.
At this stage in the negotiations, such propaganda, though valuable, cannot
be decisive. What matters most is political leadership. This then is the
third part of Mr Sutherland's strategy. He has already reminded the world's
leaders of the importance of this task, notably before the summit of the
group of seven industrial countries in Tokyo last July. He insisted then
that an agreement on market access had to be reached if the round was to be
completed. Agreement, if still incomplete, was accordingly reached.
Burden of blame
Everything now depends on Japan, the European Community and the US. Of these
Japan is likely to prove the smallest obstacle. The new government is
unwilling to liberalise imports of rice. But Japan can afford neither to
watch the round collapse nor to bear the burden of blame for failure.
Subject to the twin pressures of a strong yen and an irate US, the
government must know that free trade abroad and deregulation at home will be
its salvation. If unpalatable policies can be blamed on foreign pressure,
all the better.
The European Community comes next in order of importance. But the EC needs a
healthy multilateral trading system. The risk that bilateral trade disputes
would otherwise shred the EC's common commercial policy has already been
demonstrated by the German deal on telecommunications with the US. Moreover,
apart from agriculture, no issue is likely to prove round-breaking for the
EC. Even in agriculture only a collapse of co-operation between France and
Germany seems capable of producing a rejection of what is likely to be on
offer. Such a breakdown seemed conceivable when the narrow-band ERM
dissolved, but looks less likely now.
The heaviest burden of responsibility rests on Mr Clinton, whose job it is
to articulate the long-term interests of his country. The president has to
decide whether or not to fight for a dynamic and open world economy. The
Uruguay round is more important economically and probably more important
politically than the North American Free Trade Agreement. If Mr Clinton
fails to show the required leadership in the next few months, the round will
fail. These decisions cannot be evaded. His presidency will be judged by how
he takes them.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Paying for universities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S university vice-chancellors should be congratulated for grasping a
political nettle. Their report, which last week outlined four 'painless'
methods for students to pay towards their tuition, at last forces the
government to confront an issue which has caused it deep embarrassment in
the past.
But the need for a debate over higher education goes further than funding.
University expansion - which has seen the numbers in higher education rise
by 46 per cent in four years, despite a decline in the number of
18-year-olds - has been the most important, undiscussed policy change of the
last four years.
Neither policymakers nor educationalists seem to have given any thought to
the kind of higher education system they wish to emerge. But such a vast
expansion will inevitably bring with it greater diversity of provision. With
one in four, rather than one in seven, of the relevant age group now
involved, a similar diversity in quality also seems inevitable.
The mass systems of France and the US offer examples which the UK could
follow. Should the UK move towards a norm where most students go to their
local university, with only a gifted elite travelling to acknowledged
centres of excellence?
Alternatively, those universities with the strongest international research
reputations could be allowed to concentrate on research by becoming
graduate-only. Regional universities would then be freed to put most of
their resources into teaching.
Fair and efficient
Either course should allow a significant improvement in education for those
students who previously would have left education altogether at 18, while
leaving the best features of higher education unblemished. Access to the
true elite institutions, at the graduate level, might become more open than
it is now.
One likely consequence of such a system is that different universities would
set different fees, which would have to be paid by students. This may sound
anti-egalitarian, but few complain about the American system, where the most
able graduates of excellent and cheap state universities can move on to Ivy
League law schools.
None of these choices will be saleable unless the method of payment is fair
and efficient.
That means adopting the income-contingent loans used in three of the
vice-chancellors' four proposed new methods of funding. The 'graduate tax'
which would ask all graduates to pay a higher rate of income tax for their
entire working lives, is unwieldy and unlikely to be politically acceptable.
It can safely be ignored.
Middle-class parents
Under an income-contingent loan, students would be charged a fee, which
would be paid for them at point of entry by the state. They would repay the
loan, which would be at a subsidised rate of interest, by paying a higher
rate of national insurance or income tax, once they had graduated.
The government may feel nervous about making students pay for tuition. After
all, Sir Keith Joseph's proposals for tuition fees in 1984 were scuppered by
Conservative backbenchers in an alliance with middle-class parents.
However, income-contingent loans differ from the Joseph scheme in several
vital respects. First, parents would feel less threatened, because students
would not be assessed on the basis of their parents' income before they
matriculate. Repayments would not need to be made until the student had
started earning.
Second, loan repayments would be contingent on income. Graduates would not
therefore be deterred from opting for a low-paid career. Those who do so
would be allowed to take longer over making their repayments.
Third, by using the tax system these loans would be simple and cheap to
administer. This compares favourably with the Joseph tuition fees and with
the current loans for student maintenance, which the Student Loans Company,
rather than the Inland Revenue, must enforce.
Once the government has given the universities the help they need by
establishing income-contingent loans, it should decide what role it wants
the expanded higher education system to play. That question is more
difficult, but its importance is profound.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Personal View: Still on track for a single currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old, reviled exchange rate mechanism proved to be 'half baked' as a
stage towards a single European currency. But we should not forget its
benefits during the 14 years that it lasted. It helped get inflation down,
and it gave many banks windfall profits during the recession. Above all, it
gave us five years of currency stability when the single market needed to
demolish trade barriers.
The new, floating ERM could result in competitive interest rate cuts,
devaluations and protectionist responses inimical to further progress of the
single market. A return to autarkic nationalism can be avoided only if the
new ERM is used by governments as a more effective stage towards the single
currency than the old one. The case for one market, one money, is as strong
as ever.
The old ERM required fixed, nominal exchange rates as a condition of entry
into the single currency. What membership of a single currency area needs,
however, is fixed real exchange rates. Otherwise misaligned exchange rates
cause countries to become uncompetitive and to be a financial charge on
their neighbours. Fixed real exchange rates, with nominal rates adapting to
reflect changes in relative competitiveness, are arguably a better
preparation for a single currency than fixed nominal rates.
The upheavals of September 1992 and the realignments that followed left the
exchange rate structure with better relative competitiveness between
countries. If inflation continues to be low and convergent, in the 2-4 per
cent range in leading countries, nominal exchange rates may not need to
change much for the next few years.
The move to 15 per cent bands with no change in central parities - the one
option that none of the experts foresaw - may come to be seen as an inspired
leap in the dark. It preserves the letter of the system while changing the
spirit. Under the terms of the Maastricht treaty it will be sufficient for
countries to remain within the 15 per cent bands, which will be wide enough
for them not to need to change central parities because of divergences in
short-term interest rates.
If countries can achieve the low inflation criterion, then they can remain
competitive with only minor nominal exchange rate fluctuations. The rate at
which they enter the single currency will, according to Maastricht, be the
prevailing market rate and not the central parity.
The new ERM will allow other countries to follow Britain's lead in cutting
interest rates. Even if this results in short-term weakening of their
currencies against the D-Mark, countries such as France can also expect to
follow the UK in seeing their currencies rise against the D-Mark because of
higher growth and lower inflation than Germany.
A general loosening of monetary policy will both require and facilitate the
tightening of fiscal policy that many EMS countries are now undertaking. As
the recovery gathers pace, it will bring about a cyclical reduction in
deficits and make it easier to carry out structural deficit cuts without
aborting expansion and incurring political odium.
A strategy of this kind could see the single currency rising like a phoenix
from the ashes of the old ERM. The UK is again in danger of being isolated
by over-estimating the difficulties of monetary union, and under-estimating
the political will of its partners to achieve it. With barely concealed
schadenfreude, it appears to be advising other members of the convoy to slow
down to its own pace.
So what should Britain do to be at the heart of Europe? 1. Join the ERM at
about DM2.50 as the central parity. The 15 per cent bands have removed any
constraint on freedom to cut interest rates, while maintaining a discipline
to prevent a lapse into double-digit inflation as in the late 1980s.
2. Discuss with other ERM countries plans to move to a single currency by
1997 or 1999. The UK may not decide whether to opt in until 1998, but it
must make sure that monetary union suits its interests as much as those of
its partners.
3. Drop the plan for a hard Ecu. It is even less viable in a floating
monetary system than in a relatively fixed one. It would confuse the markets
to have the hard Ecu alongside the existing Ecu, making not one but 14
currencies. The existing Ecu could be hardened, but there is a case for
keeping the present basket definition, which has so far won the day. The
hard Ecu would be seen by others as an attempt to lead them off the trail to
a single currency.

   From Mr PETER CROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debacle of the exchange rate mechanism over the past year or so
emphasises a very clear message from the business community: until costs and
revenues are expressed in the same monetary unit the potential benefits of
membership of the European Community will never be realised.
The lesson for the European Commission and the member countries should be
clear: a single currency must be achieved as soon as possible. Without this,
the EC will stagger on in disunity for the foreseeable future and may never
achieve the desired economic benefits for its inhabitants.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Games people play: Berlin's Olympic bid has exposed
divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An elderly, dapper American woman is fast becoming a cause celebre in
Germany. At the World Athletics Championships in Stuttgart last week, she
was trying to convince the International Olympic Committee to stage the
games in Berlin in 2000. During the next few days, she will be in Berlin to
win over the sceptics to her cause. It is time, she says, for Germans to
unite and make a final bid for the Games before the IOC makes its decision
on September 23.
The woman is Ruth Owens, the widow of Jesse Owens, the black athlete who
stormed to victory in 1936, when the Nazis staged the games in Berlin. 'If
Jesse were present when the final decision is taken on who will host the
Olympic Games in the year 2000, I am sure Berlin would be his first choice,'
she said recently.
Berlin's chances for hosting the Games are slim, however. Sydney appears to
be the favourite; Beijing and Manchester are strong contenders. But unlike
the other cities which want to reap the glory and honour of hosting the
Games, as well as profit from selling broadcasting rights, Germany's Olympic
committee, and the country's industrial establishment, have a broader
agenda.
For them the Games are a means to speed up unification. 'We are not talking
political unification. We are talking about what effect the Games in Berlin
would have on the psychological unification, as well as improving the
infrastructure in east Berlin and in other parts of eastern Germany,'
explained Mr Christian Furstenwerth, the spokesman for Olympia GmbH, the
public relations arm of Germany's Olympic committee.
Those firmly behind the Games include Mercedes Benz, Deutsche Telekom,
Lufthansa, leading commercial banks, and Daimler Benz. German industry has
already pledged DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in investments and promotion. 'Berlin
was the symbol of the great divide between east and west during the cold
war,' said Mr Bernd Sturzl, a Daimler Benz spokesman. 'The games will
represent the new unity, not only of Germany, but of Europe. It would
provide such a big impulse for the psychological unity of the country,' he
added.
The desire to unite the two Germanys, not only economically and politically
but also psychologically is a dominant theme among the Olympic supporters.
But the fact that this impulse exists reflects the sense of malaise which
followed the euphoric days of November 1989, when the Berlin Wall was
dismantled. Since then, unification has often lapsed into recrimination and
bitterness.
Easterners resent the way westerners look down on them, the closure of large
sectors of manufacturing industry, and the 'colonisation' of the five new
states by western speculators. In the west, conversely, resentment focuses
on the higher taxes earmarked for subsidising the east and bringing living
standards up to western standards.
In Berlin, the divisions are even sharper. West Berliners have lost the
privileges which existed before the wall collapsed: lower taxes, exemption
from military conscription and the loss of financial support from Bonn. East
Berliners object to the high prices of food, rent and housing.
But would the Olympics help overcome the mutual suspicion between east and
west Germans? Mr Klaus Harke, a member of Bundis 90/Green Party, the main
opponent of the Games, believes the cost of staging the Olympics would
create further resentment and, in addition, recall unpleasant memories of
the 1936 Games.
'Many Berliners cannot deal with the changes. They already have to cope with
too much. Everything is too fast for them. You can't expect them to lobby
for the Olympics. With the Games, our city will be turned into a city of
services, and nothing else. And then when the Olympics are over, all the
promises about new jobs will not be realised,' he said. 'Look at Barcelona
and Montreal. They are still paying back their debts from holding the
Games.'
Berliner Bank and Daimler Benz disagree. They believe the Games will cost
about DM3.2bn, which would be financed though the selling of television
rights, private investment and marketing revenues. More important, they
argue that improvements to the infrastructure, including telecommunications,
roads, sports facilities and housing, would boost long-term investment in
the city.
'Red tape for planning permission would be cut if we had the Games here. We
could really get a move on in developing the city,' said an official at
Berliner Bank. Investment would not be confined to Berlin. Sailing events
would take place on the Baltic coast in the eastern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, thus attracting a large injection of capital for
tourist facilities. Other events would be staged in Brandenburg and Saxony.
'The Games would boost the self-confidence of the easterners. Their cities
would be visited,' said Mr Sturzl from Daimler Benz.
'Look at the situation in Berlin since unification. It is already attracting
people from east and western Europe,' said Mr Furstenwerth. 'If the Olympics
came here in 2000, it would prove that Berlin was once again a normal city.
It would be at the heart of the united Germany.'
However, the latter point is not welcomed by those in the western-most parts
of Germany, particularly people working for the federal government in Bonn.
'If Berlin gets the Olympics, it will be difficult for the government to
find excuses not to move the entire administration to Berlin,' said an
economics ministry official. The government has already pledged to shift
some department over the next few years. The date for the final move of the
government will be decided this autumn.
The official added: 'We have always used the excuse that the infrastructure
in Berlin is very poor, and in any case, it would cost too much to move the
government to Berlin. But if private investment helps prepare Berlin for the
Games, that would probably precipitate the government's move over there.
That's why I don't want the Games in Berlin.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / Calmer waters after the mutiny: A UK merchant bank that
almost foundered when it diversified in the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the start of the last century, the Baltimore linen trader and merchant
banker Alexander Brown wrote a letter of warning against diversification to
his son William in England. 'If we look around here, we find that those
persons who have steadily kept to one pursuit are far the richest men, and
those who are interested with one another in different pursuits, no matter
how profitable they may be, or may appear to be at first, are always ruined
sooner or later,' he wrote.
William took the advice, and abandoned plans to diversify the family
business in Liverpool into insurance and land speculation. He concentrated
on Brown Shipley, the family bank that came to rival Barings and Rothschilds
in strength. For more than a century after Alexander Brown's letter, Brown
Shipley remained a small, conservative merchant bank. But 190 years later,
Alexander Brown's warning came catastrophically true.
Like one of the ships for which it used to accept bills of credit, it was
wrecked in storms after losing its course, and finally suffering a fateful
mutiny. The collection of disparate businesses that Brown Shipley had become
was dismembered three months ago when its stockbroking business and holding
company were sold. A year before, the merchant bank that produced two Bank
of England governors and was once the workplace of former prime minister Sir
Edward Heath, was bought for a token Pounds 1 by the Belgian bank
Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise.
The story of Brown Shipley is not unusual. It is one of a thousand
businesses that strayed into unknown risks in the 1980s. But there is a
wider resonance for the City of London. Brown Shipley was a hallowed City
name that prospered when the old merchant banks were more firmly regulated
by the Bank. But it could not survive outside such shelter.
'With hindsight, the fundamental mistake was to diversify into so many
scattered things, rather than building on its traditional merchant bank,'
says Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, who became the bank's chairman after the sale
to Kredietbank. 'I think Brown Shipley just sort of fell asleep really,'
says a former director.
The original business was based on Alexander Brown's cotton and linen
exports to the Lancashire mills. His sons settled in New York, Philadelphia
and Liverpool to handle the financing of trade. William founded an
'accepting house,' or merchant bank, that lent its name - and
creditworthiness - to trade bills drawn by importers ordering from abroad.
This business remained profitable for nearly two centuries, but by the 1960s
was fading as other forms of trade finance emerged. Other merchant banks
moved into fee-earning business such as corporate finance and asset
management. Brown Shipley chose a different course; it formed a holding
company in 1960 to buy other lending operations, including leasing and
consumer credit.
The bank's culture was by this time more staid than evenAlexander Brown
might have wished. This was epitomised by the football team. One player, Mr
Geoffrey Bell, left the bank in 1963 and spent 18 years away before
returning in 1981 to head the bank's treasury, and eventually become joint
managing director. He found nine of the team's 11 members still there. 'It
was as if I had walked out of the office on the Friday, and just returned
after a long weekend,' he recalls.
He came back just as the old accepting houses were dealt a heavy blow. The
Bank of England started to accept the bills of many banks authorised under
the 1979 Banking Act on similar terms to the accepting houses. 'If you were
a small accepting house, you suddenly found yourself with no future,
nothing,' says Mr Bill Dacombe, who was brought in to try to save Brown
Shipley a decade later as chief executive.
The holding company responded by diversifying further. It bought four small
firms of regional stockbrokers in the mid-1980s. It remained in profit, but
returns were poor, and capital was stretched. Kredietbank had by now emerged
as the largest single shareholder, and was questioning the merchant bank's
direction. Meanwhile, a group of the bank's directors was becoming
discontented. They believed it should move more into fee-earning corporate
finance.
The differences over strategy culminated in May 1988 with what one director
calls a 'palace coup'. Mr John van Kuffeler, the bank's head of corporate
finance, became chief executive. Lord Farnham, the executive chairman,
agreed to give Mr van Kuffeler a free rein. Mr Bell was pushed aside into
the bank's treasury. The company by now had 32 businesses, and capital of
only Pounds 50m, Pounds 14m of which was the value of the headquarters
building, Founders Court. Mr van Kuffeler tried to slim the group by selling
the consumer credit arm.
But the bank's leasing arm was growing in the small company boom of the late
1980s, providing office equipment such as fax machines to companies in the
south-east. It was also trying to raise returns by expanding some higher
margin - and so risky - lending. The loan portfolio grew by 16 per cent in
the year to March 1990, and it made a record Pounds 7.5m profit. The bank
seemed to be strengthening, but it was running into two problems: the onset
of recession, and growing tension between Mr van Kuffeler and Kredietbank.
Former directors say that Mr van Kuffeler wanted to sell the leasing arm,
but was opposed by Kredietbank. The risky loans were turning bad and
stockbroking trade was down, leading to a Pounds 3.34m loss in 1991. The
night before the July annual meeting, Mr van Kuffeler was told that
Kredietbank intended to cast its 29 per cent vote against his re-election as
a director. He resigned, and is now chief executive of the consumer credit
company Provident Financial.
By November, Mr Dacombe had been brought in. After a look at the books, he
made a simple choice. 'At my second board meeting, I told them we were
heading for the shore as fast as we could paddle because there was a real
risk that we were going down,' he recalls. The first problem was its assets:
both loans and leasing were deteriorating fast.
The second problem was liquidity. After the closure of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International in July 1991, institutions withdrew funds from small
banks. Mr Bell anticipated difficulty in May, and put 54 per cent of the
bank's assets in liquid instruments such as certificates of deposit. That
figure had fallen to 23 per cent by last July as the bank sold assets to
match the Pounds 192m cash outflow. When it was finally sold, Bank of
England supervisors invited its treasurers to lunch to celebrate the bank's
survival.
The bank lost Pounds 27.1m in 1992, quartering its equity to Pounds 10.4m.
Mr Dacombe had little choice but to sell up. He disposed of the leasing arm
for Pounds 5.9m. Kredietbank paid Pounds 1 to inherit Pounds 14.7m of
provisions, and Pounds 60m of problem loans. The sale of the bank broke
Brown Shipley in two, and the holding company with its investment and
broking arms was finally bought by Guinness Peat Group for Pounds 5.6m last
March. Alexander Brown's warning had come to pass.
Today, Mr Bell is back in the managing director's office at Founders Court.
Under his direction, Brown Shipley is returning to its roots in trade
finance, accepting credit risk for commodity trade. 'They call us the metal
bank, the wool bank, the timber bank,' he says. All loans over Pounds 2m now
have to be approved by Kredietbank. Brown Shipley is expanding its private
banking business, offering clients the prestige of cheque books bearing a
gilded City name.
Mr Dacombe remains chairman of the Brown Shipley holding group. A portrait
of Alexander Brown and his sons hangs by his desk. 'I wonder what those old
boys would have done,' he muses, 'They might have said: 'There's no money in
being a small merchant bank any more. We've had a good run and we'll give up
now'.' But the warning in Alexander's letter had been forgotten by the time
it encountered storms.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Russia ready to move out of Lithuania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BORIS N MALAKHOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article 'Russia interrupts troop withdrawal' (August
19).
Russia is ready to complete withdrawal of its troops from Baltic countries,
including Lithuania, as soon as possible provided that, in accordance with
CSCE Helsinki documents of 1992, the withdrawal is conducted on the basis of
relevant bilateral agreements.
We would like to make it absolutely clear that it is not Russia that is
responsible for the delay. For example, Lithuania, at the last moment when
the agreement was practically ready for signature, changed its position.
This led the negotiating process into a dead end.
The Russian side is ready to look for mutually acceptable solutions to the
problem.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Import rules are no solution (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL MOYLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, C Fred Bergsten's article presents a plausible case for the limited use
of VIEs as a means of expanding trade, especially with Japan. But there are
three significant faults in his argument.
First, in saying that VIEs enhance trade and should be applauded not
condemned by free traders he fails to appreciate that free traders do not
support an increase in international trade for its own sake. Rather, what we
argue is that it is only possible to identify fully and capture the benefits
of wealth-enhancing international trade within a free trade regime. Not all
trade is wealth-enhancing; sometimes it is quite the reverse, either because
of commercial misjudgment or government interference. The apparent rigour of
Mr Bergsten's article is vitiated by the absence of any measure of whether
particular VIEs would be wealth-enhancing or not. How would he go about
finding out?
Second, like many other sensible people who share his view, Mr Bergsten
devotes a significant part of his article to pointing out the dangers of
VIEs and the limits that must be placed on their use. But he seems oblivious
to the possibility that domestic producer lobbies and their trade unionist
allies will succeed in capturing any measure designed to manipulate trade.
Mr Bergsten admits to unleashing a tiger but expects to control it by
relying on the impartial prudence of governments. Is this a sensible risk to
invite us to take? And what of its effect in undermining Gatt.
Lastly, Mr Bergsten is right to say that the Japanese economy would benefit
from the removal of residual protection in Japan. But just because something
is good for your neighbour does not mean he will not resist if you seek to
force it on him. Increased Japanese assertiveness in declining to co-operate
with US trade initiatives is hardly to be wondered at and illustrates the
likely ineffectiveness of Mr Bergsten's remedies.
Cobden understood this. When Britain was moving over to free trade in the
19th century he argued against seeking even to persuade - let alone force
other countries - to reciprocate on the grounds that to do so would only
make the whole effort look like a British plot. Better let Britain adopt
free trade in her own interests and let others learn from her example.
Although not guaranteeing success, that approach is a great deal more likely
to be effective than coercion. At a time when the international trading
arena is absorbing tremendous change, the very least that the US and Europe
owe the rest of the world is the power of such an example.

   From Prof JAGDISH BHAGWATI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, C Fred Bergsten's article defending the setting of targets to increase
imports by Japan is an unfortunate example of erroneous economics and
partisan politics ('Good and bad managed trade', August 18).
Mr Bergsten seeks to argue that, for a free trader, setting voluntary export
restraints (VERs) is wicked, whereas imposing voluntary import expansions
(VIEs) is virtuous. VERs restrain trade, VIEs expand it; VERs create
cartels; VIEs break them.
Balderdash. Both policies set traded quantities instead of defining trading
rules. Where VERs are import protectionism, VIEs are export protectionism.
The former give your producers a guaranteed share of the domestic market,
the latter give them a guaranteed share of the foreign market. If VERs lead
to cartels to allocate targeted reductions in exports, VIEs lead to cartels
to allocate targeted increases in imports.
Mr Bergsten presumes that the VIEs will be set 'judiciously', for short
periods, and will be confined to Japan and to her '12 sectors', where he has
now found to his satisfaction - and contrary to his earlier and long-held
conclusion that earned him the wrath of the Japan-fixated Suslovs of the
Clinton administration - that Japan is unfairly restricting imports. Of
course, Mr Bergsten forgets that those who seek VERs also claim that Japan
is unfairly expanding exports and that VERs are simply cutting them back to
'appropriate' levels.
To look upon VIEs with indulgence while frowning on VERs is plainly wrong.
It flies in the face of the historical reality. VERs, when begun, were also
considered to be temporary and judiciously targeted at industries and
nations. But they spread and grew into a systemic problem. It also ignores
the current reality of spreading demands for VIEs beyond (the original)
semiconductors to other products and of the threat by the European Community
to follow the US in that event.
That the Republican administrations embraced VERs and initiated VIEs whereas
the Clinton administration has not actually implemented any more of either
is technically correct. But it is also misleading, if not disingenuous. The
rhetoric and the oft-asserted objective of managed trade with Japan has left
no one in doubt about what the US administration badly wants: a shift in the
ground rules to targets. Has Mr Bergsten forgotten already the Miyazawa
visit to Washington and the Tokyo Summit where managed trade, and even
targets for surplus reduction, were assertively demanded of Japan?
If we have been spared these foolish policies we have to thank, not the
Clinton administration, but the Japanese government. By saying no to these
demands Japan has exercised the leadership that the US has abandoned.
Both countries need to turn energetically instead to the multilateral
system, to strengthen the rules under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(instead of weakening them as the Clinton administration's negotiators are
reputedly demanding at the Uruguay Round), and to seek resolution of trade
complaints through the GATT's impartial dispute settlement processes that
are symmetrically available to each against all others.
Mr Bergsten can do no better than to return to the ranks of those who seek
those goals with clarity and commitment, instead of applauding and
accommodating the managed-traders who, once properly on the fringe, now
occupy centre stage in Washington.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: Grassic Gibbon's A Scots Quair - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up here in Scotland, Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair (1932-34)
is something of a classic. The novels - Sunset Song, Cloud Howe and Grey
Granite - take Chris Guthrie from childhood in a Scottish croft before the
First World War, and marriage to a local farmer, through to her second
marriage and socialist fervour in the deprived urban conditions of the
1920s, and so to standing apart from her son Ewan as he grows up and becomes
a Communist in the 1930s. Two years ago, TAG Theatre Company staged a
sell-out version of Sunset Song, and now it is staging all three.
Grassic Gibbon's depiction of the bygone life of the crofts is curiously
akin to Margaret Mitchell's evocation of the vanished South in Gone with the
Wind (and, like Scarlett O'Hara, Chris Guthrie marries three times).
I say 'curiously', since Mitchell's account is rightwing and perilously
close to pulp romance; yet Scarlett is altogether less passive than the
lyrical and reflective leftwing Chris. Grassic Gibbon's vision was the most
loveable kind of Marxism. He set each character against the toughness of
their social conditions; and to anyone who struggled to determine the course
of his or her own destiny he accorded a kind of heroic dignity.
The TAG production goes straight for the lyricism of Chris's, and Grassic
Gibbon's, vision. Chris sings some of her soliloquies, in affecting folk
style (composed by Dougie MacLean); and the folk around her sing the various
songs of their time and place. They also dance; and choreographer Andrew
Howitt has economically caught the contrasting poetries of farmwork and
steel-foundry work, of social life and private life.
After Saturday's performance of the complete trilogy on Saturday, large
parts of the audience rose to their feet to hail and cheer the TAG
achievement - and, of course, Grassic Gibbon's achievement too. I applauded
too, but I found the plays too loaded with charm to be able to cheer. The
adaptation from page to stage, which has been done by Alastair Cording, is
paced with variety, but - a big but - all too often boils down important
scenes into telegrammatic precis that miss the truth of serious human
feeling.
The adaptation also exposes and highlights a sentimentality at Grassic
Gibbon's heart. Chris's father was a bully who drove his wife to suicide and
who attempted incestuous rape on his daughter; but at his funeral Chris
forgives him, because of his social conditions. Chris's first husband turns
into a drunk who abuses her; but after his death at the front we discover
that army life had wrecked him and that he had always really loved her. Her
second husband turns into an unfeeling religious bigot; but, when dying, he
rediscovers his love for her and his socialist convictions. How many of
these in-the-hour-of-death soft-centered forgivenesses can you take?
TAG presents the whole saga with just a dozen performers. Most of them have
marvellous faces, modernist faces that seem sculpted, faces that move with
maximum simplicity. As Chris, Pauline Knowles has exemplary stillness,
directness and tenderness. (Her only faults are an occasional tendency to
chant her spoken monologues and to let us know that she has found the next
Mr Right by gazing spellbound right at him.) As her son and her first
husband, Stuart Bowman is even finer; it is hard, at the third play's close,
to believe just how different he was in the first. Anne Kidd delivers a
whole range of contrasting character roles with beautiful vigour. (Only
Nicola Burnett Smith lets the side down with over-busy 'surface' acting.)
Every year you know that the Edinburgh Festival will include a few chunks of
Scottish art - a token few bits of national art amid a generally
international festival.
A Scots Quair is virtually guaranteed to charm those who want to be charmed
by Scotland. The diction alone is adorable: 'You canna manage the whole
hoose on your ain,' 'God pity the puir bairn the faither it had,' 'Dinna
fash me - mebbe he'll no' want tae,' 'My hairt is beatin' fair tae burst
frae my breast,' etc.
Even the toughnesses that A Scots Quair depicts, and its subversiveness, are
part of a Scotland many people are only too happy to believe in.
Until September 4 at the Assembly Hall.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: American soloists rescue vocal recitals - Musical
events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vocal recitals have done it again. At the end of the festival's first
week the music events had settled into a disappointingly unexciting run,
when two solo singers came along and won spontaneous cheers that at last
brought Edinburgh 1993 alive.
Both were Americans riding to the rescue, but that is no surprise these
days. The American singer is in the ascendant. They dominate in opera and,
unlike many of their predecessors, present-day American singers want to make
their mark in recital as well. Some help to broaden the repertoire away from
solid German programmes by including music from various musical traditions,
including their own; others have taken on German Lieder-singers on their
home ground and won.
Sylvia McNair is one of the first group. Her programme at the Queen's Hall
on Saturday morning began and ended in English, passing through Italian,
French, and German on the way. She is well-versed, eloquent in her own way
in all of them, though the various styles are ultimately as one to her, to
be treated to singing that falls as ravishing balm upon the ear.
In the opening Purcell solos every phrase was shaped exquisitely and sung
with beautifully poised tone - near to heaven. No wonder she chose 'The
Blessed Virgin's Expostulation' as the last one. Four Schubert Italian
settings (cleverly chosen for beauty of line and tone) and Debussy's
Ariettes oubliees were so intimate that one wanted to hold one's breath. No
matter how quietly she sings, McNair manages to keep the voice alive and
intense, which is an important gift in recital.
Inevitably, there are limitations, revealed most clearly here in her Wolf
group. 'Nimmersatte Liebe', an extraordinary song about the masochistic joys
of love, stayed unquestioningly innocent.
At least, a knowing look afterwards at the pianist (Roger Vignoles superbly
expressive) suggested the point had been understood; but the singing did
not. A certain shallowness marred each of the Wolf. Then to end, songs by
Bernstein in all his guises, the wry, the mad-cap, the sentimental. It is
always good to have such varied recitals, doubly enticing when they are sung
so well.
For the evening the festival scheduled Thomas Hampson, one from the other
category of Americans. With his good-as-native German, his intellectual
grasp of poetry, his enquiring interest into song history, Hampson has bid
fair to become an honorary European. His programmes prove as much,
concentrating on German Lieder, both the common and the rare.
Unlike his compatriot, he sang in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh's main concert
hall, not designed for solo recitals. It is easy to see why: Hampson can
draw a large audience, he has the charisma. He has the prodigality of voice,
which can expand effortlessly to a venue-filling forte with no strain, no
forcing. But it is a large hall and Hampson never truly drew the audience
in. An element of the celebrity recital remained.
He chose Beethoven and Grieg in the first half with a selection of German
songs to the poetry of Robert Burns, a nice gesture, imaginatively worked
out. After the interval the single work was Schumann's Dichterliebe.
(Readers of Edinburgh's listings magazine hoping to hear a piece called Dick
Ferliebe will have been disappointed.) Everything he sang was vivid, full of
colour, verbally clear. But the Schumann cycle failed, not helped by the
fact that Geoffrey Parsons's admirable accompaniment sounded distant and
muddled in this big, resonant acoustic.

A former ticket tout is central to the ITV drama series Frank Stubbs

FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: Elvira 40 - Chichester Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Louis Jouvet (1887-1951) was one of France's finest actors and directors. In
1936 Jouvet became an advisor to the Comedie-Francaise, and a director in
1940. The play Elvira 40 at the Minerva Studio Theatre, Chichester, is the
story of one theatre class given by Jouvet in Paris between February and
September 1940.
Brigitte Jaques' 1986 play (translated by David Edney) has never been
performed in English. It is a strange, difficult, cerebral and rewarding
chamber piece. It was drawn from shorthand notes made by Jouvet's secretary.
Jouvet annotated the transcripts as a teaching record, and they were
published in the 1960s. The text of Elvira 40 stays close to Jouvet's own
words.
Jouvet stays on stage or roams through the audience as he conducts six
lessons instructing the student actor Claudia on one scene from Moliere's
aptly subtitled Don Juan: ou le festin de pierre (1665). The seduced and
abandoned Donna Elvira returns to the Don to warn him of imminent torments
and to urge him to repent. Mozart does it in four lines flat; Moliere draws
it out; and Jouvet interprets magnificently.
Elvira 40 is a treasure chest of advice for actors and spectators. Jouvet
thought the audience always felt what the actor felt. He rails against the
timidities, modesties or embarrassments which prevent an actor from
conveying true feeling. He urges: 'with every word you say the feeling must
rise up in you. You must be flooded by what the word means .. The feeling
must force you to say the text. That's the actor's art .. awakening your
sensibilities within yourself.'
The great success of Patrick Garland's direction is that it makes theatre
the hero and gives you new ways of thinking about theatre; it makes you a
better spectator, pricking the mind with questions. Jouvet's legendary
restlessness conveys itself in a barrage of questions 'what did you think of
that? was it convincing? why?' and in broadsides of opinion: 'ignore the
full stops. Breathe in the middle of the sentence'
What Jouvet values in acting was authority, authenticity and gesture. Here,
the actors deliver. As Jouvet and Claudia, Keith Baxter and Debra Beaumont
negotiate a difficult task. Imagine musicians playing a Paul Tortelier
masterclass on the Cello Suites; they have to play Bach wrongly at first in
order to show how much they improve. Baxter and Beaumont play actors playing
actors presenting a scene.
The Minerva Theatre suits the project. Baxter finds a psychological progress
through the scenes; he gradually discards his hat, scarf, overcoat and
appears in shirtsleeves with loosened tie as summer ripens, but also as he
reveals more of his character. He carries Jouvet's intellectual delight in
Moliere and Shakespeare; he also represents Jouvet's rare ability to
separate the personalities from the issues. Opposite him, Debra Beaumont has
a harder job, but manages to improve her performance of Elvira by following
exactly the advice she receives.
Minerva Theatre, Chichester Festival (0243 781312) until 11 September

FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: A brutalist partnership dissolves - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They have been described as the most important husband and wife team in the
world of modern architecture. The death last week of Alison Smithson brings
to an end the long partnership of Alison and Peter Smithson that was so
close, personally and professionally, and for a time so influential in the
history of recent modern architecture in England. They always acted as one,
to such an extent that any of their work was always attributed to 'the
Smithsons'.
Alison Smithson was born in 1928 in Sheffield and married Peter in 1949.
They practised together from 1950 onwards, both as builders and polemicists.
The death of Alison Smithson provides the occasion for a reflection on their
mutual achievement and the effect of their work on contemporary British
architecture. They did not build a great deal. They certainly wrote a lot,
particularly their regular manifestos that appeared in the magazine
Architectural Design during the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
They were jointly responsible for three important post-war British
buildings. They became famous for their first project - the
competition-winning secondary modern school at Hunstanton in Norfolk, which
was designed in 1949 and completed in 1954. Looking back today at
photographs of this school it is hard to realise what excitement it caused
when it was new. Everyone wrote about it at the time and praised it for its
rigid symmetry and courtyard planning. It was, of course, very much derived
from Mies van der Rohe's ideas with an exposed steel frame and brick wall
panels. Service elements were exploited with the water tank elevated into a
tower as though it was a campanile. There was almost a celebration of
plumbing and much pleasure was taken by the architects in their exposure of
pipes. Their architecture soon became dubbed 'the new brutalism' - a
prophetic description - by the critic Reyner Banham.
Their second major achievement, and one that has lasted better than any of
their other work, is the office building for The Economist, in St. James's
Street, London. This remains one of the few good commercial post-war
developments in the centre of London. It is more than just new offices - it
is a microcosm of a modern planned city block that encompasses three
buildings next door to the Adam-ish Boodle's Club (actually designed by J.
Crunden in 1775).
There is nothing brutalist about this architecture. It is almost like a
modern Italian design, especially in its sensitive use of roach bed Portland
stone that gives the surfaces such unusual texture. The particular
achievement of the scheme is the way that it utilises the whole space
between two streets, allowing pedestrians to walk through and providing a
small piazza between the blocks. The block on St. James's Street itself,
originally intended to be a bank, is scaled directly to its neighbours,
concealing the too tall tower block behind.
There is something disturbing about the bank block on St. James's Street
that must be to do with it being an irregular polygon - always a difficult
shape to fit into a city grid. The slight raising of the little piazza, on
the other hand, is immensely successful. The scheme was built in 1964 and
has worn well. Civil and well detailed, it has been refurbished recently by
Skidmore Owings and Merrill who should have known better than to make the
lobby look just like any other standard American office lobby.
The third monument to the Smithson partnership may well be one that they
would have preferred to forget. It is the most brutalist of all their
structures and is precisely the kind of building that gives modern
architects and modern architecture a bad name. Robin Hood Gardens,
Bromley-by-Bow, the East End public housing built by them for the Greater
London Council, is said to represent the culmination of 20 years of
theorising about urban planing and the nature of city life.
To any eye, trained or untrained, the site of the two cranked pre-cast
concrete slab blocks, seems to sum up all that is bad about 20th century
architecture and official policy towards public housing. Only architects
could have imagined a scheme of such horror. The Smithsons, along with
others, had a fascination with 'street culture' (something no middle class
architect has ever experienced for himself), which they explored at
pretentious meetings of the Independent Group in the 1950s and showed to the
world in the infamous exhibition held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956
entitled This is Tomorrow. It was in that exhibition and in many subsequent
articles and built schemes that 'brutalist' architects reappraised the
street, talking of street decks and streets in the air . . .
We have all seen the results on London's South Bank; in the Barbican in the
City of London; and in Park Hill flats in Sheffield. Most readers of this
column do not have to inhabit the results of this mad theory - and the
residents of Robin Hood Gardens must be mystified by the double standard
that could produce the fine Economist group while condemning them to lives
that have been permanently vandalised by architectural dogma. The rampant
brutalism of Robin Hood Gardens was intended to 'replace such group concepts
as house, street, district and city which are too overloaded with historical
overtones . . .' What a sad monument to a partnership that clearly could
enhance the world.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Business park development at Canley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 3m start on creating a business park to provide hundreds of new
jobs, out of the former Rover headquarters at Canley, Coventry, is being
made by TARMAC CONSTRUCTION.
The 118-acre business park, offering a potential of 1.5m sq ft of commercial
building space, is on the site of the old Standard Triumph motor factory,
later developed as the Rover Group headquarters for administration, design
and development. Contracts have been awarded by Arlington Project Management
on behalf of Coventry Business Park for preparation work including a
permanent roadway, and associated services to form a gyratory system.
Alterations are to be carried out to give improved site access on the A45 at
Fletchampstead for Coventry City Council.
Another project to be undertaken by Tarmac Construction is the building of a
Pounds 1.8m advanced technology telephone exchange at the Royal Naval Base,
Portsmouth for the Ministry of Defence.
Among other new contracts, worth a total of nearly Pounds 7m, are the design
and build of a Pounds 560,000 supermarket for Shoprite at Dunbar in East
Lothian and a Pounds 370,000 fit out of a factory unit on the Vaughan
Industrial Estate at Tipton, for John Cotton of Colne.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Spanish office complex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS INTERNACIONAL de ESPANA SA, a P&amp;O company, has won a Pounds 167m
project management contract to build a retail and office development project
for Centros Comerciales Continente, Glorias Diagonal, SA and Centre Corts,
SA in Barcelona, Spain.
To be known as 'Barcelona Glories', the 1.09m sq ft development will provide
750,000 sq ft of retail space, including a new hypermarket for Centros
Comerciales Continente, 340,000 sq ft of lettable office space and 1.4m sq
ft of underground parking.
This new development will occupy four city blocks on the site of the former
Olivetti plant on the Plaza de Las Glorias Catalanas - a focal point of the
main thoroughfares of Barcelona.
Designed by architects Jos Galan, Cristian Cirici and Joaquin Sainz de
Vicuna, the development will incorporate a number of unusual building
techniques. Special diaphragm slurry walls will be used to construct the
four-story underground car park with three of the floors being situated
below the Barcelona water table. These walls will be installed to create the
perimeter of the underground car park. Subsoil conditions make the
installation of this watertight environment a highly complex exercise.
The exact location and size of the sand and clay areas will be determined by
extracting samples of the soil and performing water pumping tests.
The permeability of the subsoil must be known before the type of slab on
grade is determined. The uncertain subsoil conditions make accurate planning
one of the biggest challenges of the project.
The 1940s style factory building will be transformed into a commercial and
office building complex. A section of the rear of this building has already
been demolished. The remaining front part of the building will be carefully
retained as the adjacent four-storey underground car park is excavated.
The old factory will be refurbished to create high quality office and retail
space, featuring 12 ft high ceilings.

<TEXT>
Michael Harvey, former chairman and chief executive of Habitat, has taken
over as the new non-executive chairman of youth tour operator The Club, a
management buy-out of Club 18-30, once part of the now defunct International
Leisure Group. He replaces Francis Higgins, a veteran of International
Thomson on both the publishing and travel side, who has resigned over a
policy disagreement.
Jeremy Muller, managing director of The Club and a former director of ILG
Travel, had worked for Higgins at Thomson Holidays when the latter was
managing director. Muller says the recent parting, the reasons for which
were 'connected with growth', was 'perfectly amicable'. Higgins, in his
early 60s, is content to spend more time breeding his prize sheep in Surrey.
Meanwhile, Harvey, 49, who left Habitat just over a year ago in the course
of a management restructuring inspired by David Dworkin, Storehouse's
previous, and short-lived, boss, came recommended by NatWest. The venture
capital division of the bank put together a Pounds 2m funding package to
support The Club's buy-out in the spring of 1991.
Harvey has no experience of the holiday business but Muller says that it is
his grasp of retailing that is important. 'There is an awful lot of
salesmanship and hype that is needed at the sharp end of our business. A
great deal of effort goes into understanding the retailing side.'
Accordingly, Muller spent the first past of last week introducing Harvey to
Ibiza. not sparing him 'the raves and the very late nights' in an
'introduction extraordinaire' for the new chairman.
If in need of any extra excitement, Harvey can always compare notes with
Michael Julien, Dworkin's predecessor at Storehouse and Harvey's
introduction to Habitat. Julien has just been appointed non-executive
chairman of Owners Abroad. The latter's Air 2000 supplies about 20 per cent
of The Club's flights while Twenty's Holidays, the Club's main competitor,
belongs to Owners.

There are 30 working quarries on the Crown Estate - the 300,000 acres of
land the Queen inherited when she became monarch - producing such things as
sand, gravel, brick clay, stone, potash, rock salt, limestone and slate.
The man who will in future advise the Commissioners who run the Crown Estate
about these operations is Kenneth Bate who has been appointed Crown Mineral
Agent. Bate is a partner in the Wardell Armstrong consultancy; the previous
occupant of the post was Eric Hassall who retired from the partnership in
July.
In addition to the quarrying operations - revenue from which, like all Crown
Estate revenue, goes to the UK Treasury - the Crown Estate has the ownership
of all gold and silver wherever it might be found in the UK. The Estate says
that at present proposals are being considered for two gold projects, one in
Scotland and one in Northern Ireland, but will give no more details for the
time being.
As Crown Mineral Agent, Bate will advise on and negotiate leases and
licences relating to land minerals. He will also advise the Commissioners on
all aspects of minerals including identification of potential deposits,
technical matters, valuation, mine safety and land re-instatement after
quarrying.
His qualifications for this include being a Chartered Minerals Surveyor and
a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a Chartered
Engineer, a Member of the Institution of Mining Engineers and a Fellow of

FT  23 AUG 93 / Management: Searching for a healthy salary structure - Trust
hospitals are now trying to put paid to collective bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS the work of a nurse comparable to that of a physiotherapist? Can they do
bits of each other's jobs? Should they be paid the same? If so, can
hospitals afford to make the necessary adjustments to salaries without going
bankrupt?
These issues have been engrossing the personnel department at Central
Manchester Health Care Trust (CMHT) since the trust was set up in April
1991. Staff costs account for 70 per cent of the trust's Pounds 140m budget;
effective management of the workforce is therefore crucial to its financial
health.
The challenge facing Richard Sugden, director of personnel at CMHT, will be
familiar to many in the private sector. It is also shared by hundreds of his
peers in other trust hospitals who are groping for an appropriate local pay
structure to replace the nationally determined pay and conditions that cover
more than 4m NHS workers.
Job evaluation is at the heart of the changes that trusts are seeking to
make on pay. They argue that if they are going to set local rates they need
to take a fresh and comprehensive look at what medical and non-medical staff
are doing, and pay them in a fair way.
With this in mind CMHT, in partnership with trade unions and KPMG, the
management consultants, have developed Medequate, claimed to be the first
healthcare-specific job evaluation system in the UK.
The emphasis on evaluation is particularly important because of the number
of new jobs, such as the new health care assistant role, which are emerging
as trust managers examine the range of skills they need and their
cost-effectiveness.
An entitlement to set locally determined terms and conditions of employment
for new staff - but not those transferring from the health service - was
seen by the government as a core role of the new NHS trusts, the first wave
of which were set-up in 1990.
Medequate enables these new jobs to be broken down into their component
parts - apportioning to each a specific financial worth.
As yet only a handful of trusts have set their local pay terms, although
more have established some new local terms of employment. CMHT, for example,
has negotiated a number of new agreements on non-pay issues, such as common
terms of compassionate leave.
Trusts give a variety of reasons for not yet having established local pay
structures - not least that such changes take a low priority at a time when
most of them are struggling to balance budgets and reduce hospital waiting
lists.
Sugden cites other substantial reasons - cost and complexity. Some smaller
trusts, such as ambulance trusts, have made more progress than big teaching
hospitals. For many large teaching hospitals employing a wide range of
staff, adjustments in salaries relative to each other are highly sensitive.
Adjustments could also have a substantial knock-on effect on the pay bill at
a time when the government has put a 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector
rises.
CMHT is trying to get away from the present system of collective bargaining
at national level by 40 different unions and staff organisations on the
Whitley councils - the traditional negotiating forums in the NHS. All have
different salary structures. On some, employees start at the minimum and
move up, on others they can be appointed at something more than the minimum,
on others there are additional pay elements for taking on those with
slightly more responsibility. All staff, excluding senior managers, progress
because of time served. Senior managers have a basic salary and are then
entitled to receive performance related pay.
In devising Medequate, 15 factors were agreed upon as characterising, to
some degree, all NHS jobs - from qualifications and formal training to
clinical skills. Each factor is ascribed a weighting, so that the Medequate
computer software is geared to produce a job hierarchy. Not surprisingly
consultants come near the top.
Sugden says: 'The hierarchy does not tell us how much we should be paying
our staff. The trust's main board will decide what the highest level of pay
will be and the lowest.'
Sugden is coy about whether some groups may win out financially, and others
lose, in the new evaluation. But, the balance is critical if the pay bill is
not to explode. In any re-grading some salaries are likely to go up
immediately, but those which are to be reduced have to be brought down over
a period of time.
The revolutionary aspect for Sugden is that as and when new job categories
are created the formula can be used to set new pay levels. At present, for
example the hospital is looking at whether it is possible to introduce
multi-skilled teams of professionals. If this happened, the skills a team
member may have to acquire would have to be costed.
Sugden says: 'At the moment we are working in an environment where there are
clear professional demarcation lines. But in the future we may be moving
towards describing jobs in terms of the jobs people do, not their
professional grouping.
'But, part of the inertia at present in the NHS is a recognition of the
sensitivity of making changes.
'But we now have a tool that enables us to say that if we change this or
that activity this is the price we will have to pay.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / Management: Language lessons - Despite a need for
multi-lingual staff, training budgets have become tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago many British managers were concerned about their inability
to speak foreign languages. As 1992 loomed, they looked anxiously across the
channel at their multi-lingual counterparts and a hasty flurry of training
began.
The single market is barely a year old, but companies already seem to be
wondering whether it is necessary to pay for costly language lessons after
all.
At the Languages Lead Body, an organisation for the promotion of language
training, the number of enquiries from British companies has tailed off from
the peak levels of two years ago.
According to spokesman Louis Greenstock, companies are being cheapskate in
their approach to training: some have even abandoned in-house lessons,
instead sending people on local authority evening courses. Others have
invested in a few self-study packs and told staff to get on with it.
Linguarama, a large private-sector language training business is feeling the
chill: earlier this month it reported a loss of Pounds 40,000 for the first
half of this year, against a profit of Pounds 620,000 for the first half of
1992.
It seems recession-hit clients in the UK and on the continent are reluctant
to spend any more than strictly necessary on training.
The same message emerges from a recent survey by employment agency Gordon
Yates. This shows that companies are having second thoughts about whether
their secretaries need a foreign language.
More than a third of the 500 London employers surveyed say languages play no
role whatsoever in their choice of staff - a year earlier only a fifth were
adamant that languages did not matter.
'From the survey we sensed that people were getting fed up with Europe,'
says Richard Grace, managing director at Gordon Yates. 'Companies have had a
desperate time in the last year, and all forward thinking like language
training has gone out of the window,' he says.
The dwindling interest is alarming, given that the necessity for speaking
languages seems to be increasing.
A survey of the language needs of British business by the Institute of
Manpower Studies in 1991 revealed a serious shortage of language skills,
which it forecast would get worse.
All the companies in the survey identified some unmet language needs, and
most said that they expected foreign languages to become more important to
them in the future. Less than a quarter, however, intended to increase their
training in the next five years.
Companies appear to be becoming more selective when it comes to staff
language training. A few years ago, many big organisations offered language
training to any willing member of staff as a self-development perk.
Geoff Monaghan, general manager of Linguarama UK says: 'During the boom
years people got very excited and started a lot of language training
initiatives.' Companies were also over-expectant about what could be
achieved, thinking staff could be fluent after six months of weekly classes.
Companies are now more realistic about the difficulties and expense involved
in learning a language.
Recognising that achieving fluency can cost up to Pounds 10,000 and require
great effort they are spending more carefully, training only those staff who
need languages for their work, and exploiting employees' existing skills.
British Gas has been doing just this at its Global Gas division, which buys
into overseas gas markets. The company has started to log its staff
abilities including their language skills. The process is enabling the
company to fill posts from existing staff numbers in European gas markets
where few locals speak English.
For its German operation, British Gas needed 12 fluent German speakers.
After trawling its staff, it could find only three suitable candidates.
Others have been sent on intensive tailor-made training. Now, says Chris Le
Fevre, a regional controller of Global Gas, at least one of the people
speaks 'better German than the Germans - it does impress'.
Each person in the 60-strong department in London is engaged in intensive
study of a language, having lessons in office time and studying at home.
Their progress is being minutely examined and is going towards an overall
performance appraisal.
The notion of language being important is coming as something of a shock in
this mature British utility.
'Lots of people were interested in Global Gas, but when we said they had to
learn a language, they were shocked. They hadn't thought of that dimension,'
says Le Fevre.
In adopting a more selective approach to languages, companies are
recognising the need to be more precise about employees' existing skills.
Linguarama has been retained by several large companies to run detailed
programmes.
'Sometimes you get people who have done a degree in French or Spanish, but
ask them to hold a telephone call to arrange a meeting and they are lost,'
says Monaghan.
The first lesson is not to take someone's CV details too seriously: even if
they claim to speak business French they may not be able to advance much
further than 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous'?
Manpower, the employment agency, is capitalising on companies' need for
precision.
It is spending more than Pounds 1m on an appraisal and training project that
starts this month. Its temps who speak languages will be rigorously tested
on vocabulary, grammar and comprehension, to ensure they can meet company
requirements.
The Manpower project is bold as it assumes that British companies' apathy
towards languages will be short-lived, in spite of its own market research
suggesting little demand for the new service.
'People didn't see a need for multi-lingual skills,' says Lilian Bennett,
the company's chairman.
Evidently she thinks she knows what companies want better than they do
themselves. The need to speak languages is not 'a fashion thing. The single
market is going to bring up these needs,' she says.
It is only alarming that companies at the moment are too short-sighted to
agree with her.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Economics: Waiting for a Bundesbank initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION will focus on Germany this week, with the Bundesbank's policy
making central council meeting for the first time after the summer break on
Thursday and preliminary cost of living data expected in the days ahead.
Hopes of an early cut in the Bundesbank's 6.75 per cent discount rate were
fueled late last week after the bank published remarks by Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
its vice president and president-designate, that a big appreciation of the
D-Mark within Europe was 'undesirable' because of the need to preserve
exporters' competitiveness. However, price developments in Germany will be
of vital importance in persuading the council members whether or not to
lower official interest rates.
The Bundesbank policy makers and financial markets should be able to judge
on the strength of the inflation performance in states such as Hesse, North
Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden Wurttemberg, which are expected to
publish their August cost of living figures early this week. The preliminary
cost of living data for western Germany may be published nearer the end the
week.
Forecasters polled by MMS International, a financial information company,
expect the cost of living in Germany will be in a range from unchanged to
0.2 per cent higher in August compared with July. However, the year-on-year
rate is expected to show little change from July's comparatively high 4.3
per cent. The estimates reported by MMS range from 4.1 per cent to 4.3 per
cent.
The week should also produce further insights into government policy in
Japan and France.
Today, the new Japanese prime minister will be spelling out his government's
policies while the French cabinet will meet in the aftermath of this month's
upheaval in the European exchange rate mechanism. European and trade matters
are expected to top the agenda in Franco-German talks in Bonn on Thursday.
The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International.
Today: Japan, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa gives policy speech. France,
prime minister Edouard Balladur meets cabinet following summer recess; July
consumer price index. Canada, June retail sales (seasonally adjusted, up 0.1
per cent on month).
Tomorrow: Japan, June coincident index, leading diffusion index; economic
ministers meet in Tokyo. US, Auto sales for August 11 to 20 (6.3m), truck
sales August 11 - 20. France, prime minister Balladur holds news conference
in Paris. New Zealand, July trade surplus.
Wednesday: US, July durable goods orders (down 0.9 per cent), shipments,
existing home sales. Australia, July motor vehicle registrations (down 4 per
cent on year). Germany, tenders close for four year Treasury note auction.
UK, new construction orders in June.
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meets after the summer break in
Frankfurt. Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets French President Francois Mitterrand
in Bonn to discuss EC matters and GATT and also meets prime minister
Balladur. Sweden, Riksbank (central bank) council meets. US, initial claims
week ended August 21 (330,000); state benefits week to August 14; money
supply week to August 16 (M2 up Dollars 2.9bn). UK, Advance annual estimates
of 1992 national accounts; June engineering sales and orders at current and
constant prices; June energy trends; July new vehicle registrations.
Friday: Japan, Tokyo August consumer prices (up 1.8 per cent on year, ex
perishables up 1.2 per cent); national July CPI (up 1.8 per cent on year, ex
perishables up 1.3 per cent); July unemployment; July retail sales (down 3.9
per cent on year). US, August Michigan sentiment index; July export and
import price indices; July bank credit. UK, CBI monthly industrial trends

FT  23 AUG 93 / THe Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE national newsagent and retailer WH Smith, is expected on Wednesday to
report pre-tax profits for the year ended May 31 down slightly from Pounds
113m a year earlier.
Profits will be better, or at least static, in all divisions except the Do
it All DIY joint venture with Boots. The losses there are likely to rise to
about Pounds 12m from Pounds 2.7m a year earlier, reflecting sharp price
competition in the sector and the venture's problems. Smith's might lift the
final dividend from the previous year's 9.1p but the market is not taking
the increase for granted.
Interim profits at Guardian Royal Exchange, to be announced on Thursday,
should be in line with the three composites already announced. Some Pounds
65m is expected, against losses of Pounds 39m last time, indicating the
recovery of UK underwriting.
However, under FRS 3, investment gains will now be included above the line,
resulting in a maximum headline figure of Pounds 155m.
Medeva, the fast growing UK drugs company which had its stock market value
slashed from Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m in July following a warning that
full-year profits would be some Pounds 10m less than expected after
overstocking in the US, unveils its interim results tomorrow.
Analysts are unwilling to estimate how much of the shortfall will occur in
the first half.
Between Pounds 16m and Pounds 18m has been tentatively pencilled in this
time, against Pounds 14.1m last time round.
A positive statement from Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, about how things are
in the US since the overstocking problems and the temporary closure of two
plants for FDA inspections would go down well.
Rentokil, the environmental and property services company whose hostile
Pounds 75.7m bid for Securiguard, the security and cleaning group, was
recommended in July, reports interim results on Thursday. Profits of between
Pounds 63m and Pounds 64m pre-tax are expected, though last time's Pounds
51.5m will be restated for FRS 3 and the group, where 60 per cent of profits
come from outside the UK, is also moving to average, rather than period-end,
exchange rate calculations. The dividend could rise from 0.64p to 0.78p.
The Telegraph is expected to report second quarter pre-tax profits on
Wednesday of about Pounds 13m. The first quarter's Pounds 19.1m, double the
year earlier period, was swollen by Pounds 6.5m from the sale in January of
its 13 per cent stake in the limited voting stock of Trinity International
Holdings.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Consumer boost to recovery is forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS ARE in a stronger financial position than generally realised, with
the result that consumer spending can provide 'a solid bedrock' for durable
economic recovery in the years ahead, a research paper from SG Warburg
Securities says.
Giving what they call 'a Consumer Health Check', two Warburg economists, Mr
Kevin Gardiner and Mr Darren Winder, say that UK consumers as a whole have
built up an 'extremely healthy' cashflow position while the personal sector
balance sheet looks 'encouragingly firm'.
While much of the City is eagerly anticipating a cut in interest rates to
support economic recovery, they suggest that the government may eventually
have to consider limiting growth of consumer de-mand rather than boosting
it.
The Warburg economists note that the recent recession and falling house
prices have created the phenomenon of negative equity where the value of a
property falls below the value of the mortgage. But they say that the
problem has been exaggerated. They argue that conventional measures of
negative equity take no account of the value of endowment policies against
which many mortgages have been secured.
The negative equity issue has been further defused by a tentative recovery
in house prices and lower interest rates.
In spite of the recession and lower house prices, consumers in aggregate are
'still substantially better off than they were a decade ago'.
Although the ratio of personal-sector net wealth to disposable income fell
from 514.2 per cent at the end of 1988 to 431.6 per cent at the end of last
year, it was still about one third higher than the 322.7 per cent level of
1980.
The economists say that consumer spending has been reviving since the second
quarter of last year and that the recovery so far has been very much
consumer-led.
They expect further steady growth in consumer spending will result from a
fall in the savings ratio from last year's 11.5 per cent of disposable
incomes as a more settled macro-economic environment, falling real interest
rates and stable wealth give more encouragement to consumers.
The Warburg paper contrasts with a report from Lehman Brothers
International, the US-owned investment house. It ranks the UK personal
sector behind Germany, France, Japan, the US and Canada for the severity of
its balance sheet and cashflow problems.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Dedicated setter of industrial fashion: Michael Cassell
meets a man with a mission to rebuild the manufacturing base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID TURNBULL claims that he was a lonely voice in demanding a national
industrial strategy to rebuild the UK's manufacturing base. Now he has to
struggle to be heard above the clamour.
'All of a sudden, the message is fashionable. The Confederation of British
Industry, the Engineering Employers' Confederation, the Department of Trade
and Industry and assorted ministers - they're all agreed.
'But have you noticed, despite all the lip service, how little is actually
being done about it? They are playing with words. We cannot afford to sit
back and wait. We must embarrass the government into acting,' he says.
Mr Turnbull is an accountant with his own practice in Aldershot, Hampshire
and runs two professional accountancy bodies, between them representing more
than 200 firms. Although he readily admits he 'couldn't make anything to
save my life', he is also director-general of the UK Industrial Group, set
up a year ago to restore the reputation and economic contribution of the
manufacturing sector.
More than 70 companies - with a combined annual turnover of Pounds 1.5bn -
have joined the group, which is demanding an end to the decline in the
nation's manufacturing base and the creation of a sustained balance of trade
surplus. The Body Shop is the most notable recruit so far.
But while frustration at the lack of political urgency may be
understandable, is the formation of yet another lobby group, versed in the
art of special pleading, really going to help? The DTI, whose refocused
efforts to help industry are given only a partial endorsement by Mr
Turnbull, wants fewer interest groups to deal with, not more.
Mr Turnbull says: 'Organisations like the CBI are only interested in
protecting cosy relationships with government. You can be terribly subtle
and get nowhere or you can confront people with the cold, harsh facts and
demand radical policy changes.'
Many of the group's core proposals, contained in its recently released
'Manufacture or Die' policy statement, reek of interventionism and the type
of corporatist language which is anathema to the government and the leaders
of big business. Some may prove too heady for the architects of Labour's
more 'hands-on' approach to industry.
Few people now dare talk of 'picking winners', promoting 'national
champions' or, like Mr Turnbull, of rebuilding a revamped Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation.
But Mr Turnbull is untroubled. He claims he is not interested in playing
politics and just wants to see in place a strategy with the fixed objective
of raising UK industrial output by Pounds 40bn a year. 'Our approach will
take root and win support because the problem is acute and it is daily
becoming clear that there is no alternative.'
At the heart of the group's manifesto lies a plan to establish a national
investment fund, manned by industrialists and financiers and given an
initial five-year injection of Pounds 10bn a year. The Treasury -
'subordinated to serving the interests of the DTI' - would be excluded,
although the industry department would get a seat at the table.
The money, he says, would either come from government alone or from the City
and industry as well. With an eye on boosting exports and import
substitution, funds would be directed at developing best practice and
world-beating products.
'We are drawing up a shopping list to identify the products no longer made
in the UK and those for which there is strong demand but insufficient UK
capacity. The list would lead to specific new manufacturing initiatives to
meet domestic and overseas demand.'
The group is now planning its own investment fund to test the water. People
will buy industrial investment bonds, along the lines floated by Labour in
its most recent industry policy document. There is, says Mr Turnbull, a
'genuine and growing willingness' among industrialists to get a fund under
way.
'A new approach to funding is desperately needed. Just look at our national
record or under-investment and short-termism. No-one can claim the old
system has worked. Critics might sneer but governments in other countries
get fully behind their productive resources instead of making encouraging
noises from the sidelines,' Mr Turnbull says.
The UK Industrial Group has other ideas unlikely to find widespread favour.
Alarmed at the acquisition of UK productive capacity by overseas investors,
it wants a 49 per cent ceiling placed on any foreign stake in listed British
companies. New inward investment is welcomed, however.
He stresses: 'We must not lose control of the destiny of indigenous
companies and of associated technological development. There is no way a
company like British Aerospace should be able to sell a business like Rover
into foreign hands.'
The group favours government-imposed dividend re-straint, limiting payments
to an unspecified percentage of current-year profits and making illegal
payments in excess of profits or following losses. Manufacturing,
engineering and processing companies would, however, be earmarked for
beneficial fiscal treatment at Budget time. The corollary would be higher
taxes for 'unproductive' investments such as commercial property.
Mr Turnbull also has his eye on the national lottery. 'The surplus should,
in its entirety, go towards funding new manufacturing enterprises or
expanding and developing existing ones. To spend it on the arts or sport
demonstrates totally wrong priorities.'
The group will soon start a programme to promote its agenda to local
business organisations. Mr Turnbull believes the extent of the crisis facing
manufacturing will secure extensive support for the views of his
organisation.
He adds: 'If our policies are adopted, we could expect to see a significant
and sustained turnround in Britain's balance of trade within four years.
'It is no good politicians relying on another economic recovery to mask our
structural problems. If they fail to tackle them, we will all pay a very
heavy price.'

FT  23 AUG 93 / Universities relax science entry standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITIES have slashed the number of arts and humanities courses
available on the clearing system, but entry requirements for science
subjects have been lowered and admissions tutors are having difficulty in
filling places.
The extent of the difficulty emerged at the weekend. It will put pressure on
Mr John Patten, education secretary, to announce new measures on university
funding. He returns to his desk today after a six-week absence due to
illness.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said 'thousands' of young
people were being denied university places due to government inaction. Mrs
Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, called the situation a 'scandal'.
A rise of 1.6 per cent in the proportion of A-level candidates in the top
three grades usually required for university entrance, combined with a fall
of 9.6 per cent in candidates entering for physics, were held responsible
for the problem.
But difficulties had been widely predicted since tuition fees paid for each
student by the government for classroom-based courses - mostly arts and
humanities - were cut in December. Tuition fees for science courses remained
unaltered, with the intention of encouraging more science students.
According to clearing administrators, university admissions tutors are
offering places on science courses to applicants who narrowly missed gaining
places on arts courses, and who have no more than GCSE qualifications in
science subjects. Many have introduced courses combining business studies
with science subjects, in an attempt to maximise their tuition fee income
from the government.
According to the Department for Education, tuition fees are directly related
to the number of students so that they can encourage universities to expand.
They also allow policymakers to control the numbers of students entering
different disciplines.
Statistics published today illustrate that tuition fees encouraged
universities to take on more students in the academic year 1991-92. The
total paid in tuition fees increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 1.028bn, while
total recurrent income was Pounds 4.693bn, a 10 per cent increase over the
previous year.
The figures, which do not apply to the former polytechnics, show that
student numbers rose by 9 per cent, while the number of staff increased by 4
per cent.
They also show that universities had more success in raising income from
endowments and donations, with funds raised this way rising by 13 per cent
to Pounds 175m. Older universities appeared to find it easier to raise
donations - they accounted for 11.6 per cent of Cambridge's income and 9.5
per cent of Oxford's, while no other university raised more than 6.1 per
cent of its income this way.

FT  23 AUG 93 / Sales drive in Continental markets urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPANIES should start promoting sales in continental Europe following
the recent widening of fluctuation margins in the European exchange rate
mechanism, the Chartered Institute of Marketing says today.
The institute, which represents marketing managers, says in its latest
quarterly report that the effective suspension of the ERM will cause
interest rates outside Germany to fall.
Professor Douglas McWilliams, the institute's economic adviser, says in the
report that Continental markets 'should stabilise over the next nine months
and be growing by the second half of 1994' as a result.
Prof McWilliams forecasts a general improvement in the world economy for
1994-95. He warns, however, that in the near term Britain's recovery may
slow after a rapid start because of weakness in the UK's main European
markets and likely government spending cuts and tax increases. The institute
expects Britain's economy will grow by 2 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent
a year in 1994 and 1995.
Prof McWilliams says the risk of inflation damaging the UK economy in the
near future is diminishing and scope exists for the government to cut
interest rates if the economy slows.
Institute forecasts anticipate a fall in bank base rates to 5 per cent by
the end of this year from 6 per cent at present, and further declines to 4
per cent by the end of next year and 3 per cent at the end of 1995.
