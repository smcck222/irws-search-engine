FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Reich's 'The Cave' reaches London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In quick time The Cave has proceeded from Vienna (premiere in May) via
Berlin and Amsterdam to a six-day stint at the London South Bank centre.
Paris, Brussels and New York are set to follow. The
music-theatre-cum-documentary epic by Steve Reich (music) and Beryl Korot
(video images) is receiving a high-class launching. Reich's status, and the
fact that this is the latest, largest and most ambitious of his multi-medium
compositions, would seem to demand no less.
As Andrew Clements reported on this page in July, after the Amsterdam
Festival showing, The Cave is a three-part, three-hour melange in which
excerpted interviews are interleaved with visual images and musical episodes
inspired by the presence and the actual words of the interviewees. The
purpose is to contrast Jewish, Arab and American attitudes to a crucial
piece of Holy Land religious history - the relationship of Abraham, Sarah,
Hagar, Ishmael and Isaac - in a way to pinpoint conflicts, dilemmas and
misunderstandings both ancient and modern. Act 1 is the Israeli act, Act 2
the Palestinian; in Act 3, which focuses on the much more detached responses
of Americans, threads of summing-up are drawn together.
As witnessed at the opening Festival Hall performance on Wednesday, the
installation gleams and glitters impressively - a large metal set-up
enclosing five video screens amid walkways and stations for singers and
players, a structure simultaneously practical and poetic. The package is
expertly glossy, the presentation faultlessly crisp and confident. The
technological aspects of the three-part unfolding, the linkage of 'live'
musical sounds and statements and screened pictorial and verbal information,
are achieved with considerable dexterity.
For a while the fascination with 'how do they do it?' keeps concentration
from flagging. Thereafter nothing can disguise the banality of the
experience, the fidgety, flattened-out, repetitious quality of juxtaposed
statement and counter-statement, the stupefyingly predictable patterns of
Korot's image-creating devices. Amplification of all the sounds crushes the
dynamic range to a uniform loudness, restricting the expressive range of the
'live' musicians in wearying parallel.
In interview Reich has made much of the way his musical lines pick up and
underscore the inflections of all the speakers, essaying comparisons with
Janacek's celebrated method of creating musical cells out of 'speech
rhythms' that in no way work to his advantage. The systemic patterns of
Reich's musical lines, which could well bear repetition on their own, become
nightmarishly tedious when linked to words far less capable of supporting
similar repetition. Quite soon into Act 1, as a phrase such as 'Almost a
pale figure' issued from the speakers for what seemed the millionth time, I
wanted to scream 'Yes, yes, we get the point, now for heaven's sake get a
move on]'.
In sum, I though this a project boldly imagined but, in terms of basic
material, numbingly dull, insubstantial and longwinded in the execution. If,
as has already been loudly proclaimed, this is 'serious art for the MTV
generation' and 'a glimpse of what opera might be like in the 21st century',
then all I can say (with Samuel Goldwyn) is: include me out.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: This Shakespeare travels well - Andrew St George
enjoys the Oxford Stage Company's 'Pericles' and 'Comedy of Errors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Oxford Stage Company is now on the middle leg of an improbable tour
which began in Surrey and arrives in Oxford via Gdansk en route to Osaka and
Tokyo before concluding at Harlow in December. The two improbable plays,
Pericles and The Comedy of Errors suit themselves well to travel, since each
stretches geography as well as credibility. But this makes fine, honest,
travelling Shakespeare, well performed and meticulously directed.
Shakespeare wrote Pericles (1607-8) with a little help from his friends, the
novelists George Wilkins and Laurence Twine. Dr Johnson ignored it, and Ben
Jonson called it 'a mouldy tale' albeit in one of his own freshest plays.
The play looks like a dry run, or rather a wet run given the engulfing sea
images, for The Tempest or The Winter's Tale. As Pericles sails the eastern
Mediterranean, the play becomes another Odyssey, full of shipwrecks, chance
encounters, fatal meetings and warm reunions.
John Retallack directs with great tact and intelligence. He has sensibly cut
the text. He draws out the play's mysteriousness and recognises
Shakespeare's debt to music as an agency for the supernatural. It comes over
as magic realism theatre, compered by the ghostly figure of John Gower
(played by Leader Hawkins), called up to arrange the action and introduce
each scene.
However, the set detracts from the illusion created by the words. It runs
round three sides of the stage, the bottom half a covered walkway backed by
ropes hanging like drying fettucini, but the top half unused and redundant.
The lighting (Raymond Cross) is so apt and sensitive that the set becomes
superfluous, the more so because it never contributes dramatically and
because a narrator is on hand to massage the imagination.
The overall effect, however, is beguiling. The sea storms are excellent,
with two sets of parallel poles representing the wave crests, bearing up and
spewing out the swimmers, and the music (Karl James) an unobtrusive delight.
But the costumes could be better: the women in Pentapolis look to be wearing
curtains suspended from their elbows and wrists.
Most of the cast negotiate Shakespeare's difficult late verse. The scene in
which Pericles recognises his lost daughter Marina forms a wonderful, tender
moment, as she sings the old king out of madness and back into the world.
This gathers Lear and Leontes in an instant: 'Oh you gods. Your present
kindness makes my past miseries sports.'
As Pericles, Philip Bowen ages gracefully and mirrors the challenges he
meets, whether in the assertive Cleon (Colin Mace) at Tharsus, or the
elegant Simonides (Del Henney), father of Pericles' wife Thaisa (Ginny
Holder).
Pericles finishes his journey at Ephesus, where The Comedy of Errors, the
second touring production, begins. Shakespeare wrote it 400 years ago to
outfarce the farceurs and fashion a comedy based not on one but two sets of
identical and identically named twins. It is another improbable romp, a day
out in Ephesus amongst a 'rabble of vile confederates', and it is immensely
enjoyable.
The production opens somberly, the cast circling in plain, dark costumes. It
begins a beautiful unravelling of this tangled farce. Just as an actor
playing a drunk must do everything possible to strive for sobriety, so good
farce should tether itself to seriousness. Like many pleasures, farce
involves anticipation and delay; the end of the play should be the end of
satisfaction, as it is here.
Retallack develops an intelligent approach which has outgrown the motley and
red-nose school of slapstick Errors. Each individual makes the best of what
is available, and treats every instance of mistaken identity not as a
mistake but as the world as it is.
The serious approach also allows the characters to step into soliloquy, as
Antipholus of Syracuse, newly arrived in Ephesus to find his twin brother,
muses on his state: 'I to the world am like a drop of water / That in the
ocean seeks another drop.' The aside which Dromio indulges on the charms of
the cook also fits into place as a piece of whimsy in a serious situation:
'She's the kitchen wench and all grease . . . if she lives till doomsday,
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.'
The fine judgment falters in only one dreadful scene, where a quack comes to
cure Antipholus of Ephesus and wastes the scene by camping around with bells
and whistles. A few illegible doctor's notes would have been much funnier.
Again, the set seems incidental to the action; the costumes here are fine
enough and the acting strong enough to sustain something more minimal and
risky.
The acting fizzes and bubbles. The two Antipholuses (Grant Parsons and
Philip Bowen are uniformly alike each other, even to the extent of beating
their twin servants, the two Dromios Anthony Howes and Clive Duncan). This
bemused quartet is battered around the stage by Adriana, the termagant wife
to Antipholus of Ephesus, played with gattling-gun speed by Susan Colverd.
She sends insults, blows or pleasantries with equal vigour and is well
supported by the other women, Luciana her willowy sister (Catherine
Prendergast, whose mantilla resembles an extended vegetable steamer) and the
local courtesan slinkily played by Ginny Holder.
The productions tour to: Arundel (Aug 31-Sept 4), Bury St Edmunds (Sept
13-18), Bracknell (Sept 20-15), Crawley (Sept 29-Oct 2); Osaka (Oct 6-11),
Tokyo (Oct 13-17), Stirling (Oct 26-30), Taunton (Nov 2-6), Watford (Nov
9-13), Swindon (Nov 16-20), Winchester (Nov23-27), and Harlow (Nov 3-Dec 4)

FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Hot Stuff - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet another rock musical has opened in London's West End, and even for
non-addicts the cult has a certain attraction. This consists largely of
watching other people so evidently - and harmlessly - enjoying it.
Hot Stuff has arrived at the Cambridge from the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester
which is developing a musical style of its own. Basically it is an excuse
for going through the pop songs and stars of the 1970s. Not all of them are
immediately recognisable and the diction is less than distinct. Still, the
audience applauds each new number as soon as it starts.
There is the veneer of a plot picked up from the Faust legend: a young man
who gives up everything to become the greatest rock star in the world. A
screen in the background records what happens in the decade: not only the
resignation of President Nixon and the fall of Saigon, but also the decaying
nature of the world of rock.
'Nothing could be worse than the last 10 years,' says someone towards the
end. Then Mrs Thatcher appears in 1979 and David Dale, who has been playing
Helen of Troy throughout, does the prime minister in drag. Paul Kerryson
directs and the whole show is mildly infectious.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Iggy Pop 25 years on - Pop concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In rock and roll's Jurassic Park, a theme park where revivified creatures
from another age stalk the stage failing to scare the children but taking
money from their parents, Iggy Pop is one of the few dinosaurs who still has
all his own teeth.
Iggy has been at it since the late 1960s. His recorded output has been
patchy, but on stage he still gives a masterclass in the essence of rock
music. His three piece band dress dully and stay in the background. They
provide a simple musical stage for Iggy's star turn with pounding drums,
relentless bass and very loud power chords spiced up by occasional, but
brief, screeching guitar solos. 'I Want To Be Your Dog', 24 years old, fits
seamlessly alongside songs from Iggy's latest album American Caesar.
If Iggy has learnt anything in 25 years on stage it is how to exploit his
talent for rock theatrics. He starts the show bare chested, his scrawny but
well-muscled torso thrust forward. He yelps, he pouts, he stamps, he jumps.
He marches round with a peculiar stiff-hipped, arthritic strut. He clambers
on to speakers, he smashes microphone stands, he falls over. In the pause
after just the third number he dives off the stage, to the evident surprise
of his band and roadies, to be caught, pawed and clung to by the crowd and
has to be dragged back on stage. He drops his ripped jeans and hops round
the stage like a naughty child who does not want to go to the loo. He pulls
out his penis to provide a clear demonstration of the link between sexual
excitement and rock music. 'All the world's a stage,' he sneers during the
encore.
He applies his talent for the dramatic to the music as well. He has a few
aces up his sleeve and plays them cleverly. 'Raw Power', forever the simple,
crashing, statement of what Iggy stands for, is the second song. Other early
Stooges numbers pop up later: 'No Fun' builds to a frantic sustained climax.
The songs from the Bowie liaison provide a sparser, even - in the case of
'China Girl' - melodic contrast, without sacrificing the hard edge.
The show ends with a chaotic encore; more stage diving, more trouser
dropping. Beer glasses start to fly, one particularly large fan tries to
wrestle his way on stage. And Iggy drags rock music back into the primordial
ooze with a basic version of 'Louie Louie', the most basic of rock and roll
songs. He has squared the circle, proved that the basics of rock music have
hardly changed in 30 years. Here is the raw stuff from which life forms as
diverse as Deep Purple, the Sex Pistols and Nirvana evolved. Scientists
should take samples of Iggy's DNA for the benefit of later generation.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Grown-up graffiti - Jean-Michel Basquiat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
His trajectory was that of a shooting star. Discovered on the streets of New
York City by an art critic before he reached the age of 20, where he was
scrawling graffiti (signed: SOMA) on the walls of Soho and Greenwich
Village; quickly taken up by dealers and gallery curators alike; followed by
an astonishing, though fitful, flow of work that ended abruptly at the age
of 27, when he died of heroin addiction like two of his heroes, the musician
Jimmy Hendrix and the singer Janice Joplin.
That is the life-story of Jean-Michel Basquiat, quintessential New York
painter of the 1980s, who recently enjoyed a major retrospective at the
Whitney and is currently having a second large show, in Europe this time, at
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lausanne.
Basquiat, Puerto Rican on his mother's side, Haitian on his father's, was
both more and less than the legend of his life. Though born in Brooklyn, his
childhood was not a deprived one. Though his art blazes with anarchy, he was
not the wild, untutored boy that his early sponsors sometimes pronounced him
 -and perhaps even hoped he might be. He drew from childhood onwards and his
mother nurtured his passion for painting and drawing by taking him regularly
to the major museums and galleries of New York City. The work itself is full
of painterly references.
The Lausanne show charts his progress year by year, though that word
progress is itself a misnomer. In a sense, there was no progress - it was
all too hurried, too explosive, too frenetic. What his paintings and
recordings record, in canvases that teem with signs and symbols, words
combining street slogans and menu listings, images of African masks, cartoon
heroes and much else, are the violent disharmonies of his own inner and
outer worlds - that trick he had, for example, of scribbling a statement
across a painting and then immediately crossing it out.
Basquiat has been many things to many critics. Because he painted images of
Lester Young and Charlie Parker, and himself played the clarinet and the
synthesiser, he is said to be predominantly a jazz artist and his paintings
and drawings the visual equivalents of jazz improvisation. Because his
mature work grew out of a graffiti-based art and he once took it into his
head to list the per capita incomes of the states of America down the middle
of one of his canvases, he is said to be a political artist. Because he used
so much language in his work and juxtaposed his words with such
unpredictably humorous results, he was, according to yet another, a concrete
poet of the first order.
Two things are certainly true. In the words of one admirer, 'he lived his
life like a fire: he went out with the coals still hot.' And he had a
marvellously insolent way - like the young Bob Dylan - of seeing off some of
the parasites who surrounded him: interviewer: 'Do you have any Haitian
primitives at home?' Basquiat: 'What, you mean people?'

<TEXT>
Between 7.00 and 8.10 BBC1 will be screening more live coverage of the World
Athletics Championships in Stuttgart. If Britain has any success it is
likely to be achieved disproportionately by black athletes because Britain's
team contains far more than the five per cent that black people represent in
the general population. So should the government seek out the reasons why,
on the assumption that white people are being disproportionately
unsuccessful? Surely not.
The billing for All Black tells us 'Worried by the disproportionate numbers
of African-Caribbeans diagnosed as schizophrenic, the government has
announced a programme to seek out the reasons and root out any racism'. Are
we seriously supposed to believe that there is some form of racist diagnosis
going on which disproportionately attributes schizophrenia to West Indians
but not to Indians? Surely not (8.00 BBC2).
In the BBC Proms (7.30 Radio 3) the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra plays
Mendelssohn's overture Ruy Blas, Sibelius' 6th symphony, and Rachmaninov's
first piano concerto.

FT  20 AUG 93 / The Property Market: The heat is still on - Despite a recent
revival, pressure remains intense on surveyors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National's costly exit from the estate agency business with the sale
this week of its Cornerstone chain illustrates the depressed value of
residential property agencies. This is in contrast to commercial property
agencies, whose values are fast recovering.
Over the past year, the share prices of many in the quoted surveying sector
have risen sharply. Fletcher King's shares have advanced by 44 per cent;
Savills by 152 per cent; DTZ Debenham Thorpe by 150 per cent; Conrad Ritblat
Sinclair Goldsmith by 311 per cent; and de Morgan Group by 220 per cent.
Only Herring Baker Harris, which is picking itself up after recent
management upheavals, has bucked the trend with a fall of 55 per cent over
the same period.
The share prices of commercial property agents have clearly bounced back
after a long period in the doldrums. Anyone who bought shares in a property
consultancy five years ago would have seen the value of their investment
drop by between 48 per cent and 88 per cent.
But some commentators and surveying practices are concerned that the surge
in commercial property agents' share prices reflects exaggerated optimism.
'My feeling is that they (shares) have been re-rated too far. Business is
still very tough,' says Mr Selwyn Jones, a broker at Credit Lyonnais, a
french bank.
The main factor influencing surveyors' relative good fortune is the
resurgence in the property investment market. Savills recently announced a
return to profits on the back of a sharp increase in investment activity and
cost cuts. DTZ Debenham Thorpe followed with an announcement of sharply
increased profits, partly because it had arranged many deals for German
investors into the Central London office market.
But the upturn in investment activity is favouring a relatively small number
of the larger companies. The de Morgan Group struck a warning note about the
increase in number and value of property investment transactions.
'The pace of recovery is likely to be affected by a shortage of suitable
investment property and the reduced availability of loan finance for
property,' it said.
Some other pockets of business such as valuation, management and rate
assessments, are proving robust. But property advisers are still struggling
with agency work - the bread and butter of most businesses. Agents say that
an upturn in enquiries has not translated into a take-up of space. Although
retail property is begining to stabilise, few agents expect a general upturn
in rents before next year.
Rent review work is also sharply down as a result of the slump in rental
values. Taken as a whole, the value of the property services market has
fallen by more than 6 per cent to Pounds 843.3m over the past year,
according to the Chartered Surveyors Survey, published by the Economic
Development Briefing, a research group.
The survey found that agency and financial services suffered a decline in
revenue of more than 25 per cent over the past year. Only professional
services such as rate assessments, valuations and legal and planning
produced increased revenue.
The practices which have fared best have been those with valuation,
management and rating businesses; the hardest hit have been those which
depend on income from lettings and deals.
Yet many practices remain in severe difficulties; there have many instances
of cash calls on partners to ensure a partnerships's survival. These
pressures on practices have spawned a wave of mergers.
The problems have been most acute for medium-sized firms, which have neither
the breadth and credibility of their larger rivals nor the low overheads and
specialist expertise of the smallest firms.
'A polarisation is taking place, between the large surveying companies and
smaller niche players, and those occupying the middle ground are being
squeezed,' says Mr Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors.
At the root of the problem lies the sector's rapid expansion between 1976
and 1992; during this period the profession grew by an average of 3 per cent
a year. This has left a legacy of overcapacity, which is likely to encourage
more mergers and more job losses.
The recent spate of mergers has caused some consolidation in what is still a
highly fragmented sector. The top three surveying practices, DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, Chesterton and Jones Lang Wootton, each have a market share of more
than 5 per cent, according to the Chartered Surveyors Survey.
'It must be likely that with too many firms of surveyors chasing a
contracting traditional market for fees, more mergers will follow, with more
hardship for individual employees,' says Mr Lewis.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the shake-out of staff has begun to ease.
In any event, demand for new recruits is likely to remain subdued until
there is more convincing evidence of a market upturn.
'It is still pretty bleak,' says Ms Vivienne Packer, an executive search
consultant at Alexander Hughes. She notes, however, that there is demand for
some specialisms such as facilities management, which are are expanding in
an effort to offer a more complete service.
Nonetheless, the industry has shown little evidence of having benefitted
from the shake-out and capacity cuts. As existing partnerships have shed
staff, many of those displaced have formed their own practices. This has
boosted competition and kept fees down to barely profitable levels. Until
there is a convincing recovery in the property market, the pressure will
remain intense on all but the best-placed practices.

FT  20 AUG 93 / People: 'One-company man' for Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On August 19 1963 Noel Jervis walked through the door of Courtaulds to start
his first day's work with the company as an apprentice accountant.
Diligence clearly pays off. Yesterday, 30 years to the day, Jervis, who will
be 49 on December 25, was formally hailed as chief executive in waiting of
Courtaulds Textiles. He takes over on January 1 next year, when Martin
Taylor heads off for Barclays Bank.
Jervis says Taylor 'will be a desperately hard act to follow, since not only
is he a thoroughly decent chap, but he is also a man capable of searching
conversations and unafraid of taking tough decisions'.
Having been with Courtaulds throughout his career, Jervis - 'I regard myself
as the archetypal one-company man' - believes that his experience of the
company from the bottom up means that he has a feel for the organisation.
In 1980 he was appointed finance director of Courtaulds Fabric Group and
from 1982 was chairman of the group's overseas fabrics business. In 1988 he
gave up the post of finance director of Courtaulds Textiles Group to
concentrate on the international business.
Courtaulds Textiles has more than 20,000 employees, but Jervis says he has
neither a lump in the throat nor butterflies in the stomach at the prospect
of the move. His background he regards as 'solidly working class'; his
father was a miner in the South Wales coalfields at the age of 14.
As for what changes he may make, Jervis feels the need to tread carefully
and soundly.
'The City view seems to be to expect us to do something big, but we are in a
long race, not a 100 yard sprint,' he says.

FT  20 AUG 93 / People: Upheaval at Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The departure of Stewart Gowans, 38, the man responsible for refurbishing
Abbey National's public image, has precipitated an unusual amount of
upheaval in Abbey National's public relations department.
After seven years as head of corporate affairs at Abbey National, Gowans has
set up his own consultancy - Meridian Corporate Communications. Along with
partner Trevor Gardiner, he has taken offices in Leicester Square. Gowans,
who had indicated some time ago that he intended to move on, quit in May and
Paul Barber and Paul Burgen, two other members of Abbey's pr team, have left
within the last month.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: New focus for camera maker - Leica's latest and
unlikely product, a sophisticated pair of binoculars, is selling fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the price of a small second-hand car or a luxury cruise, Leica Camera
can sell you a pair of binoculars which contains such an array of electronic
and other advanced technology that it can work out distance and direction as
well as display a sharp image.
The German camera and optical company has deliberately made its new product
 -called the Geovid - as simple to use as possible. Apart from a small wheel
to adjust the eyepieces, there are only two controls: one button to read the
distance, another for the built-in compass.
'We wanted to keep the electronics in the background,' says Thorsten
Kortemeier, product manager for binoculars. 'We don't want to sell mainly to
technology freaks. We want to stress the uses.'
Despite its DM6,500 (Pounds 2,576) retail price (UK cost is about Pounds
3,000), this year's production run is already sold out to yacht crews,
balloonists, mountaineers, foresters, hunters, surveyors, rescue services
and other specialised interest groups.
For a renowned camera maker such as Leica, the Geovid is an unusual
departure. Not only does it draw on technology from other parts of the Leica
group, owned by Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny, it is made in
Switzerland by the sensor division, rather than at Leica's headquarters
north of Frankfurt near Wetzlar.
The camera side, however, provided the technology for the sophisticated
lenses, which have wide prisms - porro prisms - for better light
transmission, even in fading twilight. 'We want to become stronger in
sporting optics (binoculars),' says Werner Simon, chief executive of Leica.
'The Geovid is part of that strategy.'
The new binoculars use infra-red laser beams to measure distance, with a
microcomputer making calculations to the nearest metre up to 1,000m or more.
A digital magnetic compass works out the angle of direction, even when the
binoculars are tilted. The user simply presses one of the two buttons twice,
once to fix a red aiming light on the target and again to display the
measurement.
Yet however successful the Geovid proves to be, binocular sales will
continue to be dwarfed by sales of the company's classic and robust cameras
and lenses, projectors and enlargers, together accounting for 80 per cent of
business. Last year, Leica Camera's turnover rose by 3 per cent to DM214m.
The company's reputation is based on its camera work, with advances in lens,
mechanical and electronic technology matched by a typically German
dedication to continuity.
Thus when Henri Cartier-Bresson, the French photographer, was presented with
a new Leica camera on his 75th birthday in 1983, he declined the offer of a
new lens, says Simon. 'He took out the lens he had owned since 1954, fitted
it into the 1983 Leica with a neat plop, and said 'Voila, ca c'est Leica'.'
There are other intriguing Leica anecdotes. A few years ago, perched
precariously on a Nepalese rockface to take pictures of wild honey
gatherers, Eric Valli, a French photographer, dropped his Leica lens. When
he found it, the lens was still usable in spite of a fall of 80 metres, with
no optical damage and only a slight centring error.
Leica's reputation is bolstered by such tales. But, as Simon stresses, it
takes more than stories to protect the company's position as a producer of
quality, consumer products. Leica's spending of a high 4 per cent of
turnover on research and development underlines this point. 'We're not in
our niche because of 'the myth of the past',' Simon adds. 'A myth lasts
perhaps five years, but quality has to be achieved anew each day.'
The first Leica camera was shown in 1925 at the Leipzig trade fair, although
Oskar Barnack, its inventor, made the prototype before the first world war.
The camera was made by the Leitz microscope company, the word Leica deriving
from Leitz camera.
Since then, Leica has developed a unique position as a maker of products
which meet the most demanding standards and are priced accordingly. Along
the way, the company has had to cope with the almost total dominance of
Japanese companies in the photographic sector. Its main German rivals such
as Rollei, Zeiss Ikon, Voigtlander and Agfa have either left the camera
scene or occupy much smaller segments.
In common with Hasselblad of Sweden, which makes medium format cameras -
totally different from Leica's 35mm products - the German company occupies
its own corner in the world camera market. Leica's speciality is the M6
rangefinder camera - a descendant of Barnack's original camera - which
combines high-speed lenses with highly accurate focusing and an almost
noiseless shutter release.
In the single lens reflex market, where Japanese companies such as Nikon,
Minolta, Canon, Pentax, and Olympus predominate, Leica has developed its
R-series, the latest R7 automatic version costing DM3,900 (Pounds 1,795 in
the UK); lenses are extra, from DM1,180 to DM32,000.
Simon says Leica has weathered the worldwide recession well, but admits it
can no longer raise prices as it would like. Its move five years ago to a
new building in Solms, near Wetzlar, has helped it hold down production
costs. It also offsets some of the high expense of doing business in Germany
by carrying out pre-assembly and other work, such as small binocular
manufacture, at its plant in Portugal.
Leica's main lens work is kept in-house. It has spent DM1.2m on a
computer-controlled lens manufacturing line in Solms, cutting the time taken
to grind, polish, coat and mount its complex lenses from 12 to three weeks
and lifting productivity by 20 per cent.
Final camera assembly takes 26 hours; the rangefinder alone for the M6
camera has 104 parts. Thus, says Burkard Kiesel, vice-president for
development and operations, further efficiency gains will be elusive, even
with the most advanced design and production software.
'It's hard to see what further savings we can make without losing any
features on our products,' says Kiesel. Leica's profitability will depend on
customers' continuing willingness to pay heavily for top quality products.
The innovatory Geovid will be the latest test of the company's high-priced
appeal.

The coconut could prove to be one of the industrial diamond's best friends.
Researchers in Germany have developed a novel way to diamond-coat tools and
components based on the hydrogasification of charcoal. The best results have
been obtained with charcoal from coconut shells.
Unlike conventional hydrogasification processes, the method developed at the
Frauhofer-Institute for Surface Engineering and Thin Films uses a closed
circuit, preventing the escape of gas. The process is therefore kinder to
the environment. Frauhofer-Institute: Germany, 40 5472 1860.

A welding technique, developed by the Paton Institute, in Kiev, promises to
increase Tig (tungsten inert gas) welding productivity in the west by a
factor of 10.
The process involves painting the metal parts to be welded with a non-toxic
paint which constricts the arc inside the metal during the welding. While
stainless steel or titanium welds of 2-3mm are common outside the Ukraine,
the Paton Institute regularly welds metals 10mm thick, using the same amount
of gas.
The institute, which is represented by the Welding Institute in Cambridge,
is keeping the chemical formulation a closely guarded secret. Paton

FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: New glass shatters car-jackers' plans - Worth
Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shatter-proof glass, developed for the windows of jet airliners, could
soon protect the domestic car driver from 'car-jacking', where the windows
of a stationary vehicle are smashed by a thief intent on removing valuables.
Developed by Pilkington Aerospace, the glass has a plastic inner lining
bonded to it. The plastic, part of the polyurethane family, is
'self-healing' so that if scratched it returns to its original form. It
would take a thief up to 50 strong blows to break through the new glass. The
plastic lining also prevents shards falling into the car if the glass is
broken.
Pilkington believes the technology will be used first in VIP and police
cars, as it would add several hundred pounds to the cost of a new car.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: Sharper image on the box
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE'RE living in a pixel world,' believes Willy Johnson, chief executive of
Durant, a company better know in Japan than in Johnson's home town of
Lymington, on the south coast of England.
Pixels, picture elements which form the images on miniature flat-screen
television sets and portable computers, are Durant's business. Or more
precisely, Durant is in the business of 'depixellation' - getting rid of
them.
The 'pixel problem', as Johnson calls it, is that liquid crystal screens
produce stunning pictures but are tiny. Manufacturers have been unable to
produce larger flat screens because the quality control needed is
exorbitantly expensive to attain. Just one malfunctioning pixel and the
whole picture is ruined - and a 16.5-inch screen, for example, would need
more than 1.2m pixels.
The most obvious other solution would be to blow up the picture, but then
each pixel becomes clearly visible, destroying the picture quality. And this
is where Durant's technology comes in.
Several Japanese games and computer makers are now testing Durant's
Microsharp technology, which is essentially a series of holographic lenses.
Superimposed over the liquid crystal screen, the lenses spread the light
emitted by each pixel so that they merge into a continuous picture, with the
light emitted from adjacent ones.
These graded refractive index (Grin) lenses are produced by exposing a sheet
of photopolymer film, made by Du Pont, to ultra-violet light. Microsharp has
taken eight years to develop and Johnson is confident the company has
secured watertight international patents. Durant is on the point of signing
an agreement with a US company for manufacture of the lenses.
After that, the possibilities for Microsharp could be endless, believes
Johnson. Television pictures could be displayed on large screens or
projected onto walls. Helmets for virtual reality could incorporate
high-quality images displayed on two screens inside the helmet. Microsharp
could even be used to produce a more efficient generation of solar-powered
electricity generators.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Management: A source of best practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best companies in Europe have already achieved a 10-12 per cent
reduction in their material costs, according to a survey on strategic
sourcing by the consulting firm Booz. Allen &amp; Hamilton.
The survey, conducted among 238 companies in the automotive, chemicals,
consumer goods, electrical and electronics, heavy equipment and industrial
products sectors, shows that the majority of businesses are now managing to
contain material price inflation to between zero and 5 per cent a year.
Purchased materials represent at least 40 per cent of turnover for more than
two-thirds of the companies in the sample; in some cases the figure was as
high as 80 per cent.
Among the characteristics of those businesses which have done most to reduce
costs and increase quality are: the commitment of top management to the
purchasing process, the involvement of different departments in decision
making and the separation of sourcing strategy from day-to-day execution.
The research, among companies in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
the Netherlands, confirms that the traditional 'arm's length' supplier
relationship is declining in favour of greater interaction.
Sixty per cent of those interviewed now insist on a regular presence at
their suppliers, compared with 40 per cent five years ago. That trend is
expected to continue over the next five years, so that the occasional
visitors to suppliers will only represent about 25 per cent.
Companies are reducing their supplier base at more than 3 per cent a year -
a figure which Booz says is likely to double.
The majority of the worst performing companies still use individual purchase
orders, while the best performers are moving to 'lifetime' agreements or
multi-annual contracts.
The best also achieve more with fewer resources. In many cases the smaller
the purchasing department the more impressive the performance in terms of
material costs, material quality and inventory turnover.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Management: Driving out the old regime - John Griffiths
describes how Toyota's working practices transformed one of its UK car
components suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, began production in Britain only in
January. But this pioneer of lean production systems, which is widely
recognised as setting a world standard in efficient manufacture, is already
having a dramatic impact on the management practices of more than 150 UK and
continental component makers.
Since the beginning of this year Toyota's first car for Europe, the Carina
E, has been emerging at an ever faster rate from the assembly line at the
company's Pounds 800m-plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire.
As with Nissan's Sunderland factory and Honda's at Swindon, the line is
being supplied not by the once-feared influx of Japanese component companies
 -which has almost totally failed to materialise - but by mainly indigenous
British and continental companies.
They are widely varied in their size and activities; from British Steel's
Llanwern plant in south Wales, supplying coated steel strip, to small
concerns providing the 10,000-plus individual parts which make up a modern
car.
Last month a Department of Employment-commissioned study suggested the work
practices and culture needed to meet Japanese cost and quality targets are
resented by those suppliers' work forces.
But there is no visible sign of that at Advanced Engineering Systems (AES),
at Tipton, west Midlands.
AES, a supplier of machined castings and other parts to Toyota, Honda and
Rover, provides one of the most vivid examples of the cultural adjustments a
British supplier, with its roots stretching deep into the old, adversarial
traditions of the UK industry, has had to make en route to its goal of
becoming a world-class supplier.
A year ago AES was part of Beans Industries, a former British Leyland
subsidiary which, among other things, was churning out reconditioned engines
for the Unipart group. Unipart bought 80 per cent of AES from Beans, with an
option to acquire the remainder shortly, purely because the company had
contracts to supply seven components to Toyota.
Unipart Industries - the group's components manufacturing arm - had already
learned much about quality from Honda. In a benchmarking study of 17
Japanese and UK components firms carried out last year by Dan Jones -
co-author of The Machine That Changed the World - and Andersen Consulting,
it was the only UK company to match the best Japanese companies on quality.
But the study showed it was unable to ally quality with Japanese
productivity. What better way to try to close the gap than to supply to one
of the most efficient of all Japan's vehicle makers?
Despite his previous experience of working with Honda even Frank Burns, AES'
managing director, was shaken by Toyota's reaction when asked for its
approval of the Unipart move.
'We said we wanted to acquire the business and why - and did they have any
objections? They said 'we don't mind but please hire these 20 people' and
gave us a list of individual names. We did, of course and that gave us an
early insight into the incredible detail with which Toyota tackles
everything it does.'
Burns and David Nicholas, managing director of the parent Unipart
Industries, had no problem persuading Beans employees to co-operate, and
were able to offer the inducements of improved staff status and other
elements of the Unipart package.
'They all wanted to join the 'new world', despite there being no recognition
for unions,' recalls Burns. (Unipart derecognised all unions two years ago,
although there is no ban on membership.)
AES remains a small company, employing 40 now and an expected 50 by the end
of this year. It is divided into two main areas, one working for Honda, the
other for Toyota. The Honda area, which has been running for a year, is well
advanced, refining the team working systems brought from Premier Exhausts,
another Unipart subsidiary, as the combined experiences of working for Honda
and Toyota are absorbed.
Training is top priority - to achieve quality and to address the
productivity issues highlighted by the benchmarking study. Fifty per cent of
team members can perform every operation on the 13-machine Honda sector; 60
per cent can perform 80 per cent of the tasks and the proportions are
climbing weekly.
That the training bill is currently one half of wage costs also illustrates
one of the key operating influences of Toyota still alien to a vast swathe
of UK industry. AES invested in all the necessary systems and capacity for
the Toyota contract months before production began. Eighty per cent of the
contract's cost base was built into the opening phase of manufacture - a
proportion likely to be the norm for all future business.
'It means', says Burns, 'that we have the right machines, quality standards,
manning levels, training etc so that costs fall rapidly as production gets
under way. The classic western approach is minimal initial investment,
rectifying mistakes and putting in more investment as production builds.'
Three months ago, Burns went to Japan to take part in Toyota's latest
production system course. He found himself looking anew at areas where he
had thought he already had a lot of the answers. He is teaching the course
to AES' employees and later the whole group.
The insights about waste, he freely admits, left him initially incredulous -
notably the proposition that up to 85 per cent of employees could not be
working at any one time.
'They said that around the factory you could normally find 5 per cent of
people visibly not working. But then a further 25 per cent could be waiting,
even if briefly, for deliveries or for a machine to finish its cycle. Then
you could have a further 30 per cent building inventory. Toyota regards that
as not really working because there is no immediate contribution to the
manufacturing operation. Last, they figure that up to 25 per cent can be
working to method and requirement - but the method itself is not efficient,
involving wasteful movements for example.
'I got back; we checked, and found those numbers weren't far off. The
problem is that UK managers tend to focus on the 5 per cent visibly not
working and possibly those waiting - and are totally unaware about the
rest.'
The benefits arising from Toyota's unrelenting attention to detail has led
AES to adopt U-shaped production cells, in which one operator can move
easily from one machine to another, controlling a sequence of processes,
rather than operating just one machine.
Initially, each machine required an operator to press two centrally mounted
buttons and watch the process begin. A visiting Japanese engineer suggested
replacing the buttons with Toyota's flap-type switch mounted at one end of
the machine that the operator could hit with the flat of his hand at the
start of his tour of the machines.
Burns acknowledges it sounds trivial. 'But they are an integral part of
Toyota Production System (TPS). And in saving one second they equate to 64
man weeks on the seven lines. We reckon we can save 2-2.5 per cent of the
labour bill a year - that's the entire training bill for some companies'.
The switches illustrate the different philosophy required for TPS. 'The
natural, British management response when the suggestion came about moving
buttons was 'Pounds 25,000 - just for moving buttons]' And on that ground,
in the past, it would never have been done.'
The Japanese visitor produced 185 kaizen (continuous improvement)
suggestions. And AES' teams have come up with half as more again.
The application of TPS principles is already showing in productivity. On the
Honda flywheels line, four men were producing 750 flywheels a week on two
shifts. Introduction of the U-cells and related improvements, plus a third
man lifted output to 1,000 a week. The third man has now been redeployed but
output remains at 1,000 a week.
Premier has also introduced the Toyota U-cell system, with reported
productivity gains of 30-40 per cent. Perhaps warning other European
components groups about the cost and quality benefits deriving from such
close links with the Japanese, one leading European vehicle producer is
switching to Premier as its exhaust systems supplier.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Management: Legal dangers of stress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Got a headache? Can't sleep? Drink too much? Feel depressed? Got high blood
pressure?
One solution for victims of stress could be to sue your employer, according
to employment lawyers Nicholas Rochez and Mark Scoggins of Davies Arnold
Cooper, the commercial law firm. They say it is likely that a British
company will be sued for stress in the next five years.
In a recent report* they argue that stress cases will follow the path of
other injuries at work. They say that laws which were drafted to prevent
accidents can easily be turned to include mental effects of stress.
Employers who have taken no steps to identify and reduce stress at work may
well find themselves having to pay up.
Companies will doubtless argue that to extend the law to cover stress would
put an unrealistic burden on them. After all, people who do stressful work
know that the pressure is part of the job, and are usually paid enough to
compensate for it, or so the argument goes.
Lawyers point out though that similar claims were made about asbestosis,
coal miners' lung and noise-induced deafness. Cumulative trauma claims will
evolve the same way, the law firm argues. If they are right, companies
should act now to avoid getting themselves into legal hot water later.
Insurers should take note too. At the moment companies are covered against
claims causing 'bodily injury or disease'. But it is possible that a UK
court could rule that these policies also include mental injury, as has
happened in New York.
But even if stress never reaches court rooms, companies which take a
positive stand on the problem and attempt to do something about it, will
have more direct spin-offs in terms of lower absenteeism and a happier
workforce.

FT  20 AUG 93 / 100,000 companies 'breaking data protection law'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100,000 businesses and other data users are illegally handling
information on private individuals, says a report from the National Audit
Office, the public spending watchdog.
The report, which reveals widespread ignorance about the existence and
purpose of the Data Protection Act 1984, calls for a renewed effort to
increase registrations and a better policing system to ensure full
compliance with the law.
Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, who administers the act, has
told the watchdog that only about 150,000 organisations have registered
under the legislation.
Mr Howe admits that there is no 'satisfactory or reliable' method of
establishing the number of data users who should register. His most recent
estimate of 250,000 is thought to be a conservative one.
Under the act data users cannot use or disclose information other than for
strictly defined purposes. Individuals have right of access to the
information, which can be amended or erased if it is inaccurate.
Failure by qualifying data users to register under the act is a criminal
offence, although there have been few prosecutions because of difficulties
in proving illegal activity.
The watchdog reports research by the registrar which suggests that one in
three small companies and nearly one in six large companies are unaware of
their statutory obligation to register. One in eight small companies know
nothing about the act.
According to the watchdog, there is 'little investigative effort' aimed at
checking registration, with most attention paid by the registrar to ensuring
the renewal of registration on expiry.
Even so, the report says, many data users are failing to re-register, while
attempts to monitor compliance with good practice among registered data
users are limited and are usually invoked only in response to complaints
from the public.
But high levels of ignorance also persist among the general public, the
watchdog says. It reports that although four out of five people regard
protecting people's rights to personal privacy as very important, the same
proportion is unaware that the law grants them rights and safeguards about
information held on them.
The watchdog says that a campaign to publicise the act should be launched.
The report, however, acknowledges the legal and financial constraints that
limit the registrar.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Tory rightwing warns on tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT could face a fresh backbench rebellion if Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, uses the Budget to extend value added tax without cutting
public spending, the Thatcherite wing of the Conservative party has warned.
In a blunt message to Mr Clarke the Conservative Way Forward pressure group
yesterday warned that extending indirect taxation 'will not be accepted
unless a sharp pruning knife is taken to public spending first'.
The group, which counts ministers among its supporters, says in the summer
issue of Forward, its quarterly magazine, that increasing direct taxation
would be 'totally unthinkable'.
The warning came as Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister who is
chairman of Conservative Way Forward, serves notice that the civil war in
the party is far from over by launching a vitriolic attack on Mr John
Major's 'disunited' government.
He writes in Forward that the government 'all too often fails to give even
the impression of leadership' and laments 'a terrible 12 months'.
Lord Parkinson says that what is now needed is a period of 'solid and
stable' government. Disillusioned Conservative voters do not want 'a whole
series of speeches from the prime minister setting out his philosophy'.
Yesterday's warnings came amid mounting evidence that the strengthening
recovery may be reducing pressure on Mr Clarke to consider significant new
tax rises in the Budget on November 30.
Such thinking was given a boost by this week's announcement that the
public-sector deficit was a lower-than-expected Pounds 1.55bn in July. But
Downing Street has so far preached caution, with neither it nor the Treasury
yet prepared to revise downwards the government's forecast of a Pounds 50bn
PSBR for the financial year.
Also in Forward, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of
Directors, calls for spending on the welfare state to be cut by Pounds 20bn
by 1997.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Knorr cube-making moved abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CPC (UK), subsidiary of the US food group, is to move production of its
Knorr brand of soups and cubes from Paisley, near Glasgow, to more modern
CPC plants in France and Italy to cut costs.
As many as 345 out of the 449 jobs at CPC's Paisley operations are to be
lost, but the company hopes this can be done through voluntary redundancy
and early retirement.
The company said yesterday it had reached its decision 'after much concerted
effort to reduce the cost of Knorr brand production at Paisley'. It said
that overall costs remained 40 per cent higher than at other CPC plants.
The company - whose European headquarters are in Brussels - is to expand
production of the Knorr range at Dupprigheim in France and Sanguieth in
Italy. These plants have larger production capacity than the Paisley plant,
which will continue to produce Hellmann's mayonnaise.
Ms Cathy Coveney, Transport and General Workers union convener at the
Paisley plant, yesterday said the union was asking the company to produce
its figures to substantiate its claim of a huge cost difference between the
UK and Continental plants.
Earlier this year Hoover concentrated its vacuum cleaner production at
Cambuslang, near Glasgow, and closed its facilities in Dijon, France because
of Britain's low labour costs.
Knorr products have been made at Paisley for 30 years.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Privatised utilities attacked over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR YESTERDAY stepped up its attack on the level of executive pay
increases in the privatised utilities and called for a 'new era' of
responsibility in boardrooms, David Owen writes.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the highest-paid directors of
companies privatised under the Conservatives had benefited from 'enormous'
salary and perks increments of up to 95 per cent in the past financial year.
Such increases could not be justified after industry had been hit hard by
the recession, Mr Brown said. He criticised 'massive double-your-money share
option awards' which he said had been given in the privatised industries.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Two teams win defence radio deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC competition to build a Pounds 1bn-plus battlefield radio
system for the armed services entered a fresh stage last night when the
Ministry of Defence awarded initial project development contracts to two
consortia.
The contracts, worth about Pounds 25m each, have been given to a consortium
led by Siemens Plessey Systems, which is partnered with Racal, and a rival
group led by ITT of the US, whose team includes Canada's Northern Telecom
and BAeSema, jointly owned by British Aerospace and Sema Group.
A third consortium, led by GEC Marconi and including Thomson CSF of France,
has been dropped from the race, confirming industry speculation. The
ministry said that the proposals from Siemens and ITT proved to be more
attractive, but would not go into details.
Racal's share price rose 1p to close at 248p yesterday in a falling market,
while GEC's closed 2p lower at 345p.
The competition to build the Bowman communications system has attracted
virtually all the world's big defence communications groups. At stake is not
only the final production contract - worth more than Pounds 1bn and due to
be awarded in 1997 - but the prospect of spin-off orders from other armed
services overseas.
Bowman will become the UK's combat radio system, covering everything from
hand-held radios for soldiers in the field to strategic radio systems at
brigade headquarters.
It is expected that it will replace the Clansman family of radios - used by
the Army, the Royal Marines and the RAF - in 1999.
Clansman was introduced in the 1970s and is a voice-only system. Bowman will
be a voice and data system, necessary for running many modern weapon
systems. It will also be more secure than Clansman, as it can
'frequency-hop' to prevent interception.
The Ministry of Defence had been considering replacing Clansman for some
years, and invited companies to tender for Bowman.
This prompted the creation of three consortia - Yeoman for Siemens and
Racal, Crossbow for the ITT team and Arrowhead for the GEC Marconi group -
because the job was seen as too complex for one company alone.
The two winners will now enter a three-year 'project definition' stage,
funded by the ministry and industry.
Mr Adrian Day, managing director of Racal Radio, said an eventual victory
for the Yeoman team would be good news for the armed forces and British
industry, and would help 'to maintain the UK technology base in a sector
where this country leads the world.'
ITT also expressed pleasure at winning a development contract, and said
that, if Crossbow won, the UK content of the eventual production contract
would be more than 75 per cent.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Judge points to weakness of Homes Assured books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS 'a complete management breakdown' at Homes Assured, the mortgage
broker that collapsed in 1989, an Old Bailey jury in London heard yesterday.
Judge John Rogers QC described weaknesses in its accounting systems in his
summing-up at the end of the trial of three directors. Homes Assured went
into liquidation with debts of Pounds 10.7m within two years of its
creation.
He cited witnesses who had described Homes Assured's regional subsidiaries
as having 'wildly varying accounting systems'. Only two of the businesses
had the ability to provide information to headquarters 'as and when
required'.
He recalled that Mr Douglas Dunkley, who was appointed head office
accountant in April 1988, had told the court that the 1987 accounts were
delayed for many months.
The judge reminded the jury that none of the defendants had given evidence,
but said this should not cause them to draw adverse conclusions.
He described Mr Anthony Dobson, who started Homes Assured in late 1987, as
'by all accounts a man who is enthusiastic and perhaps prone to considerable
exaggeration'.
The judge said the prosecution had suggested that Homes Assured was 'not
properly run, under-funded' and badly organised.
'Even after that time when its insolvency should have been obvious to
everybody it went on trading,' he said in his summary of the prosecution's
arguments.
Three directors, Mr Keith Woodward, Mr Anthony Dobson and Mr Michael
Robinson, all deny a joint charge of fraudulent trading from November 1988
to August 1989.
Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable
security by deception and Mr Woodward one of furnishing false information.
The summing-up is expected to conclude today.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Oftel rejects cellphone complaint

<TEXT>
OFTEL, THE telecoms regulator, has rejected complaints that Mercury
One-2-One, the cheap-rate cellular mobile telephone service to be launched
soon, is acting unfairly to competitors which want to provide a service on
the same network.
One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury's parent Cable &amp; Wireless and
telephone company US West, is required under its licence to provide airtime
on the new service for rival service providers.
Mr Don Cruickshank, the director-general of telecommunications, said
yesterday that he would not be justified in concluding that One-2-One was
showing undue preference to its own direct sales division by offering other
service providers disadvantageous terms and connection arrangements.
The decision follows complaints to Oftel from some potential competitors.
Mr Cruickshank also rejected allegations that the network operator was in
contravention of its licence by securing preferential supplies of handsets
which it was refusing to make available to others.
Oftel is still investigating complaints alleging unfair cross-subsidy of
handsets.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Roof support system at Bilsthorpe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE ROOF support system used at Bilsthorpe
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and deep mines throughout the world - relies on steel bolts three metres
long which are coated with adhesive resin and rammed into the rock above the
coal, Clive Cookson writes.
The bolts strengthen the sandstone rock in the same way as steel can
reinforce concrete. Mr John Harrison, lecturer in rock mechanics at the
Royal School of Mines, London, said it was a common misunderstanding that
bolts were used to attach a roof to a hard rock stratum. 'In fact the rock
supports itself and the tunnel roof becomes a strong beam.'
The photograph shows a rock bolted roof at Asfordby pit, Leicestershire. The
steel mesh hung from the bolts does not give structural strength but is
intended to prevent small pieces of coal or rock falling.
Mr Harrison said yesterday that - contrary to claims by the National Union
of Mineworkers - rock bolting was faster and cheaper than traditional steel
arches and also a safer way to support the roof.
He said: 'Rock engineers understand that if you make the rock capable of
supporting itself, it is far stronger than any engineering material. Steel
arches allow the rock to fail around the arch.'

FT  20 AUG 93 / Coal unions urge roof-bolt probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All THREE main coal industry unions yesterday called for an 'industry
summit' on roof bolting after the collapse of a roof at Bilsthorpe colliery,
Nottinghamshire, killed three men.
British Coal rejected the claim that roof bolts were less safe than
traditional supports and the broader criticism by the National Union of
Mineworkers and some Labour MPs that safety was being sacrificed to improve
productivity.
Mr John Longden, British Coal's Nottinghamshire Area director, said: 'It is
wrong to assume that roof bolting was at fault. The roof fall was so massive
that no support system could have held it.'
Mr John Meads, head of the British Association of Colliery Management, one
of whose members died in the accident, said roof bolting done properly was
'safer than other forms of support'.
He described as 'political scaremongering' the claim that safety was being
sacrificed. 'The accident trend has been down, not up, in the past few
years.' Last year saw just three fatalities at British Coal, the lowest
number on record.
Nevertheless the inquiry into the Bilsthorpe accident will concentrate on
roof bolting. Bolts, which can cut the cost of driving new roads and of
maintenance by up to 50 per cent, started to replace steel arches in many
British mines in 1988.
The NUM and Nacods, the supervisory union, have at national level opposed
bolting for many years, while the Union of Democratic Mineworkers has
generally been more supportive. But yesterday Mr Mick Stephens, the UDM
general secretary in Nottinghamshire, backed the call for a bolting inquiry.
He said: 'We have always had some doubts and naturally those doubts have now
grown'.
Virtually all 30 British Coal pits use bolts somewhere with local union
agreement. Throughout the industry there is at least 100 kilometres of
roof-bolted ceiling.
British Coal said last night that bolting at each site was carefully
controlled and a code of practice agreed with the Health and Safety
Executive.
Critics, such as Mr David Feikart, an energy consultant and former NUM
official, say: Bolting was developed in America and Australia where pits are
generally less deep than in the UK and have more uniform geological
features.
Bolting appears not to give the same warning noises as a creaking steel
arch.
People are not properly trained to understand how bolting works.
Mr Feikart does not deny that safety has been improving - which he
attributes to heavy-duty coalface equipment - but believes continued
pressure for cost-cutting is causing problems, especially with outside
contractors.
He and Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, yesterday said the
government was about to change mining health and safety regulations. The
most controversial change abolishes the deputy function - which has
traditionally combined production supervision and responsibility for safety.
The NUM and Nacods have argued that the changes will provide too much
discretion to mine managers to improve productivity at the expense of
safety. The change was, unusually, not agreed by union representatives on
the Health and Safety Executive.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Call to scrap council reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT's plans for reorganising local government in Wales and
Scotland should be withdrawn, leaders of the Assembly of Welsh Counties and
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said yesterday.
In a joint declaration after a meeting in Cardiff they described the
proposals as 'a serious threat to local democracy, to the delivery of
services and to the social and economic well-being of communities'.
They called on the government to set up independent commissions to recommend
the structure and organisation of local government that would best deliver
services.
The government has published white papers for local government reform in
Wales and Scotland. In Wales the existing eight county and 37 district
councils would be replaced by 21 unitary authorities.
Scotland's three island, nine regional and 53 district councils would be
replaced by 28 single-tier councils.
The Welsh and Scottish associations said: 'The process of transition is
certain to be costly and hinder the development of policies on community
care, on protection of the environment and on the encouragement of
investment.'
The associations said they would not co-operate with the government over its
proposals, and reorganisation should not be considered until it had agreed
to create a directly elected Welsh assembly and Scottish parliament.
In contrast to the Assembly of Welsh Counties, the Council of Welsh
Districts wants the government to press ahead with the reforms.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Heseltine's crusade progresses in silence: Industry minister
Tim Sainsbury tells Kevin Brown why the DTI's cultural revolution is still
on track despite some setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLE with industrial policy, says Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry
minister, is that it takes a long time to produce results.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, gave his department a
new lease of life last year when he initiated a raft of proposals designed
to improve Britain's industrial competitiveness.
The policy revamp revolves around a 'partnership' between government and
industry, and a deregulatory crusade to rid companies of the burden of red
tape.
But 16 months later there is little concrete evidence that the Heseltine
approach is working. In part this is because the DTI was sidetracked for
most of last year by the pit closure crisis.
The department has also been leaderless since June, when Mr Heseltine
suffered a heart attack while holidaying in Venice. He is recovering, and is
expected to return to work in time for the Conservative party conference in
October.
Mr Sainsbury, in charge of industry policy in Mr Heseltine's absence,
concedes that there is 'some scepticism as to whether (the new approach) is
actually going to deliver'.
Part of the problem, he says, lies in the low-key nature of the partnership
work, much of which takes place out of the public eye.
As examples, he points to the DTI's efforts to improve the relationship
between carmakers and component companies - regarded as vital for improved
competitiveness - and its success in persuading a number of companies to
co-operate in bidding for overseas contracts - acting, in effect, as
'national champions' - rather than wasting resources by bidding against each
other.
'It's not 'hold-the-front-page' stuff,' he says. But the result has been 'a
big improvement' in the DTI's relationship with industry, much of which was
contemptuous of the department less than two years ago.
Dipping into a briefing file he quotes with approval speeches in which
corporate leaders have praised the department's 'supportive' role. 'You
would not have got that not long ago,' he says.
Nevertheless, progress towards the fulfilment of many of Mr Heseltine's
initiatives has clearly been slower and more difficult than expected.
For example, only 40 of 100 'exporting experts' who were to be seconded to
the DTI from the private sector have been appointed. It has been 'difficult'
to find the right people, Mr Sainsbury says.
More importantly, perhaps, the opening of the first of a network of
'one-stop shops', intended to offer comprehensive advice to small
businesses, has been delayed by several months.
The shops, dismissed by some critics as a gimmick, are regarded by Mr
Heseltine as an important vanguard in the march towards a cultural
revolution in business and government.
Mr Sainsbury says he is not concerned by the postponement - the first shop
will open in Birmingham at the end of September - claiming that he is more
interested in ensuring that the shops offer the right service.
But the delays serve to highlight the department's difficulties in producing
concrete evidence that the Heseltine regime is making a difference to
industry.
Much will depend on the success of the second arm of policy, the crusade
against red tape, which will focus on an omnibus deregulation bill in the
next parliamentary session starting in November.
Already the department is claiming some successes. A series of seven
business taskforces is busy identifying regulations that could be scrapped,
and the European Commission has agreed to consult industry before issuing
draft directives, rather than afterwards.
Mr Sainsbury says co-operation from other departments - which are supposed
to be helping in the reduction of red tape - is 'getting better', mainly
because the prime minister has made clear his strong support.
'I think the message has been received and understood,' Mr Sainsbury says.
Nevertheless, he admits: 'Industry, quite reasonably, wants to see some red
meat. It wants to see things actually changing.'
That may take some time. About 3,500 regulations have been earmarked for
investigation, and the DTI has given the impression that many could be
scrapped easily.
This may be true of rules such as those which regulate the spacing of
clothes pegs in factory changing rooms, or which designate harmless
commodities such as Brillo pads as dangerous substances.
But many regulations have health and safety implications or are incorporated
into workplace agreements, or implement EC directives. Those will be more
difficult to shift.
For the moment everything is on the table in negotiations with other
departments - including the deregulation of London buses, which has not yet
been dropped by the transport department in spite of criticism from Tory MPs
and business pressure groups.
'The concept of working in partnership to help British industry is not easy
to grasp because it is not something dramatic like privatising British Steel
or finding a home for Rover,' says Mr Sainsbury.
But, he says, the department will be judged in the end by its performance.
'When people see the bill I think they will realise that we are making real
progress.'

FT  20 AUG 93 / London hotels 'most expensive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSPEOPLE PAY more for a hotel room in London than anywhere else in
Europe, according to a survey of business travel costs published today.
A listed rate of Pounds 223 for a single room in a typical four-star hotel
chain in the city compares with Pounds 127 in Dublin and Pounds 123 in
Milan.
However, the survey, by Visa, the credit card organisation, found that
London offers some business-travel bargains. The bill for a day's
secretarial services is less than a third of the fee charged in Geneva. And,
while taxis are expensive, car-hire charges are among the lowest.
British businesspeople face a bewildering array of varying travel costs
across the continent, says Visa.
Eating out in Geneva is five times more expensive than in Barcelona, and the
cost of a secretary in Amsterdam is five times greater than in Milan. Paris
has the cheapest taxis but the dearest breakfasts. In Oslo a 30-minute
telephone call costs as much as a cup of coffee.
Mr John Chaplin, Visa vice-president for market development in Europe, said
this variation in prices created difficulties for any company attempting to
rationalise its travel and entertainment costs.
'In these competitive times many companies are attempting to control costs
by formulating a coherent travel policy,' he said. 'But if a company pays
Pounds 120 for a hotel room in Dublin and is then charged Pounds 220 for a
similar room in Brussels, forward budgeting and cost control can become a
nightmare.'

FT  20 AUG 93 / Savers withdraw highest figure recorded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING society savers withdrew Pounds 11.5bn last month, the highest
figure recorded, to give the societies a net outflow of funds in July for
the second consecutive month, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said savers withdrew money to pay for holidays, L-registration cars and BT3
shares.
The net outflow of Pounds 61m followed June's outflow of Pounds 56m - the
first month this year when societies suffered a net outflow.
Mr Coles said that July's figure was not unexpected given the recent BT3
share offer. 'Seasonal factors will also have had a depressing effect, since
July is traditionally a month when consumers withdraw funds to finance both
holiday spending and purchases of new cars,' he said.
Lending for new mortgages continued on an uneven course with net new
commitments falling last month, reversing a rise in June. Net new
commitments fell to Pounds 2.9bn in July from Pounds 3.2bn in June.
The figure represents a significant fall from July last year, when net new
commitments totalled Pounds 3.4bn. Mr Coles said, however, that a
year-on-year comparison was misleading because this time last year buyers
were rushing to beat the deadline to avoid paying stamp duty on house
purchases up to Pounds 250,000.
He added: 'New commitments have remained around Pounds 3bn since March,
suggesting that the current levels of lending activity will be broadly
maintained.'

FT  20 AUG 93 / Tourism spending up 7% to Pounds 25bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS SPENT more than Pounds 25bn on tourism to all destinations last year
in spite of the recession, an increase of 7 per cent in real terms from
1991, the UK tourist boards said yesterday.
Travel to destinations outside the UK fuelled the growth, however, with
holiday areas in Britain seeing their market share decline, according to the
English, Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh tourist boards.
Spending on tourism outside the UK by British travellers rose in real terms
from Pounds 12.62bn in 1991 to Pounds 14.41bn last year, while British
tourists travelling in the UK spent Pounds 10.66bn, compared with Pounds
10.85bn in 1991. Each of the four tourist boards registered declines in real
spending in their region.
Last year 80 per cent of trips were to destinations in the UK, but those
outside the UK lasted twice as long and cost five times more.
The report reveals a variety of distinctions between the four main regional
tourism markets of the UK.
Of English tourists, 90 per cent visit English destinations, while 50 per
cent of Scottish tourists choose to holiday in Scotland. Just 22 per cent of
Welsh tourists holiday in Wales, while 66 per cent of Ulster travellers
holiday in Northern Ireland.
England remains the most popular destination in Britain, accounting for 47m,
or 59 per cent, of all UK residents' holidays. The most popular type of
holiday destination in England remained the seaside resort.
Other points of the study include:
Hill-walking, hiking and rambling ties with swimming as the most popular
activity pursued on holiday, closely followed by visiting cultural and
historic sites.
Travelling by car to holiday destinations was the preferred means of
transport for 78 per cent of travellers.
Hotels, motels and guest-houses accounted for 21 per cent of holiday
accommodation on all trips, with many more people - 37 per cent - staying
with friends and families.
August was the most popular month for holidays - 19 per cent of all trips
start then.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Replica eggs ruffle feathers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRD protection officials are concerned that a new range of reproduction
wild birds' eggs could prompt more people to steal the real things.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds disputes claims by Emerald
Collectables, the company making the replicas, that the collection of about
50 popular and unusual birds' eggs is a 'conservation-friendly' alternative
to the illegal practice of nest-raiding.
Mr Ron Grover of Emerald's marketing department said: 'We think people won't
bother with stealing eggs because the replicas are so exact. Even the people
who make them can't tell the difference if you put them next to real eggs.'
Mr Chris Harbard of the RSPB said, however: 'We are concerned that by
highlighting the attractive nature of birds' eggs this could result in
people taking up the collection of real eggs, which are free - if you don't
get caught.'
The RSPB believes there are at least 300 active egg collectors in Britain.
It said: 'Young people are taking this up all the time. It is a kind of
collecting mania which is not disappearing and every egg collected means one
bird killed.'
Mr Grover said that other authorities had welcomed the replicas, which
include reproduction golden eagle, jackdaw, kestrel and avocet eggs. One
bird sanctuary was substituting reproductions in a golden eagle nest while
it tested eggs for for fertility.
He added: 'I don't agree with the RSPB at all. They have been extremely
rude. We sent them a letter offering them a percentage of turnover for their
backing and they haven't even had the courtesy to reply.'
Subscribers to the collection receive a selection of four to six eggs a
month as well as a wall unit to display them. Each egg comes with a profile
of the bird.
The RSPB believes the collection, which costs more than Pounds 200 for about
50 eggs and accompanying paraphernalia, will have limited appeal to egg
thieves.
Mr Harbard said: 'For some of them it is the challenge of evading the
authorities or even the physical test of reaching the egg on a dangerous
precipice. They meet to compare collections and . . .score brownie points
off each other.'
The society said it had received a letter of complaint from one member.
However, the company said the collection had attracted 'widespread
interest'.
Some schools believe the reproductions had 'educational potential' and one
museum plans to use the eggs for schoolchildren to handle.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Lending increase points to steady recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODESTLY STRONG bank and building society lending last month was consistent
with an improvement in consumers' willingness to take on new debt,
economists said yesterday.
Bank of England figures showed a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.8bn monthly
rise in M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private and
corporate sectors. This was slightly higher than expected and a big rise on
the figure in June, when lending rose Pounds 627m.
With official consumer credit figures, the M4 data reflect a steady, if
gentle, recovery.
Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese Bank, said: 'The
overall message from the figures is that debt is beginning to pick up again.
They are consistent with economic recovery.'
The underlying growth of broad money, or the M4 money supply, remains weak,
however, and points to continued low levels of inflation.
Broad money - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society
deposits - grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in July compared with
June. This took the year-on-year growth rate to 3.6 per cent, up from 3.3
per cent in the previous month. Although the one-month increase was quite
sharp, the annualised growth rate remains close to the bottom of the
government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range for broad money
growth.
Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association, covering lending by
the UK's nine biggest commercial banks, confirmed that the trend in lending
continues upwards, although it has not yet reached the levels of a year ago.
Lending by these banks to the UK private sector was a net seasonally adusted
Pounds 1.4bn in July, well up on June's rise and on the average of the last
six months, both of which were less than Pounds 800m.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the bankers' association, said: 'The
composition of lending still presents an all-too-familiar picture with very
strong mortgage demand . . . but good-quality commercial propositions are
rare.'
Unadjusted figures from the association show strong mortgage lending last
month offset by reduced lending to most other categories. Mortgage lending
rose Pounds 1.05bn, the highest monthly figure for two years and 24 per cent
higher than July last year.
Consumer credit, however, fell Pounds 192m on the month, nearly twice the
reduction of July last year. Within this there was a small increase on
credit cards of Pounds 21m.
The only significant increase in lending in the companies sector was a
Pounds 410m rise in lending to securities dealers, although there was also a
Pounds 117m rise for manufacturers. The association said this possibly
related to corporation tax payments.
Lending to property companies, retailers, building societies, wholesalers,
hotels and caterers and construction companies fell.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Profits rise well ahead of earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPANY profits grew far faster than earnings as the economy continued
its steady growth in the second quarter, the Central Statistical Office
reported yesterday.
Measured at current prices, provisional figures showed that gross trading
profits of companies rose by 4.8 per cent between the first and second
quarters of this year and were 9.6 per cent higher than in the second
quarter of last year.
Overall income from employment rose only 0.1 per cent in the second quarter
compared with the first and was 1.6 per cent higher than in the second
quarter of last year.
Figures for the UK gross domestic product deflator, the most comprehensive
measure of domestically generated inflation, suggest overall earnings from
employment may have fallen in real terms between the first and second
quarters.
According to yesterday's data on UK output, income and expenditure, the GDP
deflator rose 0.6 per cent between the first and second quarters but was
just 1.1 per cent up on the second quarter of last year, the lowest annual
growth rate since the third quarter of 1962.
The Central Statistical Office confirmed its earlier estimate that GDP
increased by a real, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in the second quarter
and was 1.5 per cent up from the same period last year. But it was unable to
provide complete figures on the components of GDP. Officials said details of
the construction industry were omitted because of a lack of official data
and because the Department of the Environment would not consent to the CSO
publishing its own forecast of latest trends.
Information provided yesterday showed that consumer expenditure rose by a
real 0.5 per cent in the latest quarter and was up 1.9 per cent on the year
before. Gross domestic fixed capital formation fell 0.7 per cent after the
first quarter's erratically high 0.8 per cent growth rate but was l6 per
cent higher than in the second quarter of last year. By contrast, general
government final consumption rose 1.1 per cent in the latest quarter but was
2.7 per cent down on the second quarter of last year.
The Treasury said the 'figures confirm the recovery is under way over a
broad front'.
Capital expenditure by UK manufacturing industries fell by a real 1 per cent
in the second quarter and was 1 per cent lower than in the same period last
year, according to provisional estimates.
The CSO said that total capital spending was little changed in the year to
the end of June compared with the previous four quarters, although spending
on plant and machinery rose 1 per cent and on vehicles by 25 per cent.
Outlays on new building work fell 14 per cent.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Motorola to spend Pounds 50m on Scots plant expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA, the US electronics group, is to spend Pounds 50m expanding its
semiconductor plant at East Kilbride near Glasgow to meet what it calls
'exceptional demand' for its products.
The expansion will create 180 jobs, taking the workforce to more than 2,000.
It follows the completion of a Pounds 40m expansion project announced just
over a year ago.
The project, which involves installing new equipment and building extra
cleanroom facilities, will enable Motorola to expand its capacity to make
6in wafers for customer-specific integrated circuits.
The investment also involves accelerating production of digital
signal-processing chips to meet a 'huge surge' in demand throughout Europe.
The 400,000 sq ft plant's total production capacity will increase by up to
25 per cent.
Mr Steve Hanson, Motorola's assistant general manager for Europe, said:
'This is in response to an exceptional demand for our products which has
outstripped our expectations, even since our announcement just last summer.'
He added: 'Motorola East Kilbride is playing a leading role in Europe in
meeting these demands.'
Some of the extra demand is for semiconductors for use in telecommunications
equipment such as mobile telephones, especially from China and eastern
Europe. There is strong demand from the personal computer and workstation
markets, and from automotive products.
Motorola manufactures mobile telephone equipment at its plant at Easter Inch
in West Lothian, which opened in early 1992 and is already being expanded.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NORTHERN IRELAND textile company has won an order to supply traditional
Arab headgear to a distribution company serving Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Dubai
and Bahrain.
Lintrend, based at Larne, has adapted a technology it developed for
producing wrinkle-free linen to cotton fabrics, and is to use it to make
wash-and-wear cotton yashmaghs, ghuttras and thobes - respectively coloured
headgear, plain white headgear and full-length white gowns.
Mr Fred Sloan, managing director, said: 'The material maintains a permanent
lustre like silk. It can be machine-washed, does not need ironing, does not
fade with washing and keeps its appearance throughout its life. It looks
like a million dollars.'
He said his company had developed the technology to produce crease-resistant
linen, 'but there has been strong market resistance. People seem not to
believe it is linen if it doesn't crease.'
Looking for an alternative market, he applied the technology to cotton
fabrics, and found that there was a demand for non-crease cotton gar-ments
in the Middle East.
The initial Pounds 1.8m order will be to supply the ghuttra and yashmagh,
and to then start producing the thobe, the full-length shirt which is worn
throughout the Middle East. Mr Sloan said that the thobe will be made from a
mixture of cotton and molinease, a natural cellulose fibre.
He added: 'Unlike artificial fibres, this mixture will dissipate heat and
will bring a big improvement in comfort for the wearer.'
He plans to have orders worth Pounds 9m a year within five years, and to
increase his Larne workforce from 26 to 300.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Brazilians curb wage adjustments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S economics team was yesterday celebrating its most impressive
victory in the federal Congress to date.
The Congress voted by 318:144 late on Wednesday night to pass government
legislation granting monthly wage adjustments of 10 percentage points below
the monthly inflation rate.
The vote brought to an end a battle begun two months ago, when the Congress
approved monthly wage adjustments aimed to keep employees' pay fully abreast
of inflation.
The horrified finance ministry estimated then that such full adjustment
would cost the government the equivalent of an extra Dollars 11bn a year on
pensions and salaries, based on this year's figures.
The change on Wednesday night was the result of frantic lobbying in Congress
by government members. Mr Jamil Haddad, health minister, was forced to quit
after his party had refused to support the government.
In a final push to secure legislators' votes, Mr Winston Fritsch, chief
economic policy-maker, presented Congress members with figures to show that
inflation would top 50 per cent a month in December if the full adjustment
were retained.
The vote took place amid galleries packed with trade union members who
jeered the result and threw banknotes into the auditorium.
Afterwards Mr Odacir Klein, a Congressman from the Democratic Movement
Party, which had supported the government, warned the administration: 'This
was the last blank cheque - now we must see some results'.
A jubilant Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, appealed for
patience yesterday: 'We won't do anything crazy such as shock plans, price
freezes, dollarisation or prefixing of prices. We will do what is necessary
and you can be sure we will reduce inflation.'
The Brazilian financial markets yesterday had their best day for months. The
main Sao Paulo stock market index closed last night at 85,132 points, up
5,598 on the day.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US June trade deficit soared 44 per cent to Dollars 12.06bn (Pounds
8bn), the highest monthly shortfall in nearly six years, the Commerce
Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Imports rose 5.1 per cent from May to a record Dollars 49.7bn, while exports
fell 3.3 per cent to Dollars 37.65bn. The resulting deficit was well above
private economists' expectations of an Dollars 8.6bn deficit and the biggest
since the Dollars 12.56bn gap for October 1987.
Meanwhile, the US deficit with Japan climbed to Dollars 4.33bn from Dollars
3.75bn in May. President Bill Clinton's administration wants Japan to keep
stimulating its economy so as to bring its trade into better balance by
importing more.
The Commerce Department slightly revised its estimate for May's total US
trade deficit to Dollars 8.38bn from a previously announced Dollars 8.37bn.
US trade with western Europe deteriorated to show a deficit of Dollars
1.70bn in June from a small surplus in May of Dollars 332m.
Exports of US-made industrial supplies fell Dollars 826m to Dollars 8.85bn
in June, while consumer goods exports fell Dollars 202m to Dollars 4.3bn.
One of the few export bright spots was sales of civilian aircraft, which
rose in value by Dollars 521m to Dollars 2.19bn. Analysts had said Boeing's
foreign deliveries increased to 22 aircraft in June from 18 in May.
However, imports of many goods rose sharply and pushed the US further into
the red on trade. Car imports climbed Dollars 431m to Dollars 8.59bn, while
imported consumer goods grew by Dollars 629m to Dollars 11.3bn.

FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US seeks less chip reliance on Japanese

<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department has put forward plans to increase
government-sponsored efforts to reduce US semiconductor manufacturers' heavy
dependency on Japanese suppliers of ceramic semiconductor packages.
Mr Ronald Brown, commerce secretary, stopped short of recommending that
President Bill Clinton invoke powers to limit imports or order that a quota
of US government purchases be made from domestic suppliers.
The ceramic packages are used to house some types of semiconductor chips,
including most microprocessors and many of the chips used in military
equipment. Japanese suppliers, led by Kyocera, dominate the world market,
supplying over 90 per cent of ceramic packages for chips used in some US
weapon systems and an estimated 60 per cent of those used in commercial
semiconductor products.
The decision follows an incident that showed the vulnerability of the
semiconductor industry to interruptions in supplies of critical materials.
An explosion at a Sumitomo Chemicals plant in Japan is raising serious
concerns about a possible shortage of epoxy resins used to make
semiconductor packages for standard devices such as memory chips.
The Commerce Department plan, announced on Wednesday, follows a nine-month
study of the semiconductor ceramic packaging industry, prompted by a
petition filed last November by two US ceramic package makers - Coors
Electronic Package and Ceramic Process Systems.
The US companies claimed that dependency on Japanese suppliers of ceramic
packages was a threat to US economic competitiveness as well as to military
security. The department concluded that imports do not now represent a
national security threat.
Mr Brown also directed the US Bureau of Export Administration to review
criteria for determining what constitutes a 'national security threat' after
the ending of the cold war. Industrial competitiveness might be included.
The case has been closely watched as a bellwether of the Clinton
administration's stance on government intervention to protect strategic US
industries.
However, the department's apparent reluctance to impose limits on imports is
believed to have been influenced by the opposition of US semiconductor
manufacturers.

FT  20 AUG 93 / 'Creeping crisis' warning for US airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING restrictiveness in the world's skies is a 'creeping crisis' that
threatens to cripple US airlines and ultimately the US economy, according to
Mr Gerald Baliles, head of a federal commission set up to analyse the
industry.
Formally unveiling the commission's proposals yesterday, Mr Baliles urged
the government to work towards increased access to foreign markets and to
cut the tax and regulatory burdens on US airlines. He also called for
modernisation of the air traffic control system, including the adoption of
satellite technology known as the Global Positioning System, to increase
system capacity.
The National Commission to Ensure a Healthy, Competitive Airline Industry
was established in April to look into ways of ensuring the future
competitiveness of the US industry, which has lost Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6.7bn) in the past three years.
While many analysts believe the airline industry is beginning to revive
along with the general economy, Mr Baliles emphasised that the industry
would never be sound without substantial structural change.
He said he feared other nations would renege on bilateral airline access
agreements because the US had become the world's lowest-cost competitor. He
urged faster negotiation of multilateral access agreements to keep US
airlines from losing business to protected foreign carriers.
The commission also recommended that foreigners be allowed to purchase up to
49 per cent of the voting stock of US airlines - a move likely to face
opposition in Congress. However, the change might provide the US with some
leverage to pry open international skies, Mr Baliles said. Commissioners
suggested that the move be contingent upon increased access to the
purchaser's home market.
The commissioners rejected a return to the tight regulation of the industry
that was abandoned in the late 1970s. However, it proposed that a financial
advisory committee be established to monitor the behaviour of at-risk
carriers.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, welcomed the commission's
recommendations. 'United strongly supports the negotiation of multilateral
agreements - as opposed to conventional bilateral agreements - between the
US and foreign governments,' he said.
Outside analysts suggested, however, that the commission was really just
tinkering, because industry problems stem more from overcapacity and a soft
economy than from any structural problem.
Mr Kevin Murphy, who analyses the industry for Morgan Stanley, the New York
investment bank, said: 'The good news from the perspective of Wall Street is
that the report still has a laissez-faire bent, it's more fine tuning than
reregulation.'

FT  20 AUG 93 / Chicago lawyer is brought in to head Clinton's Nafta drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr William Daley, a Chicago lawyer,
to head the administration's lobbying for the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Mr Daley - brother of Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago and son of the late
Mayor Richard M. Daley, who ruled the city for 21 years - had long been
widely expected to take the job. Nafta supporters were puzzled at the
administration's apparent lethargy in getting its lobbying operation under
way.
Mr Clinton said Mr Daley's appointment could not be finalised earlier
because he was waiting for Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to
negotiate side agreements aimed at protecting labour and the environment.
The president had insisted on these before he would support the ambitious
free trade treaty by the US, Mexico and Canada. The side agreements were
concluded on Friday, and Nafta supporters are annoyed the administration has
left the field clear for opponents of the treaty since then.
Mr Daley said winning Congressional support for Nafta would be 'quite a
challenge'. Being from the Midwest, his territory is home to much opposition
to Nafta but he has close ties to trade unions, the treaty's most fervent
critics. If the treaty is passed, it seems likely to do so with more votes
from Republicans than from Mr Clinton's fellow Democrats.

NIPPON KAYAKU, the Japanese chemicals company which is the world's biggest
supplier of an epoxy resin used in making semiconductors, is to raise its
prices by as much as 30 per cent, writes Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
The move follows an explosion last month which halted production by Sumitomo
Chemical, the market leader, until the end of the year. It lends substance
to fears among chip makers that epoxy makers will use the shortfall in
supply caused by the accident to restore profit margins, which had been
eroded by aggressive pricing. Nippon Kayaku said yesterday it was investing
Y1bn (Pounds 6.5m) to enlarge capacity at its plant and would increase
prices from next month by at least Y200 a kilogram, from its current
Y600-Y700 range. Its expanded production will come on stream in January.
About then, Sumitomo is to restore half its previous capacity.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Play it again and again, Uncle Sam: A controversial market
in second-hand CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGN in the window is discreet and handwritten: CDs for as little at
Dollars 2.99 (Pounds 1.97). But the savings to be garnered inside this
downtown Manhattan record shop in New York are anything but modest.
Products at Dollars 2.99 may be rare but used compact discs in the Dollars
6-Dollars 10 range are plentiful. For example, Next Exit, Grover
Washington's 1992 album, is being sold for Dollars 8.99. The same CD,
purchased new in Tower Records, one of the biggest mainstream record stores
in the area, costs Dollars 14.99.
Shops like this have become the focus of a crackling debate in the US,
leading in the past month to lawsuits and heated accusations.
On one side are retailers and consumers, interested in being able to buy and
sell recordings at the best price. On the other are some of the largest US
record labels and well-known recording artists. They are concerned that
sales of used CDs will cut into new purchases, and that royalty flows will
be reduced.
The volume of business in these sharply discounted, second-hand CDs is
reckoned to be small. The Recording Industry Association of America, a
Washington-based trade group, says total sales of CDs rose by 22.3 per cent
to 407.5m units last year, or over Dollars 5bn in value. Used CDs are
estimated to account for only 1-2 per cent of this.
But the second-hand market's growth potential could be considerable. Many
music retailers would like to exploit it. A second-hand CD is unlikely to be
noticeably inferior in quality to a brand-new product - unlike a vinyl
record, or even a cassette tape. Mr Russ Bach, president of Thorn-EMI's CEMA
Distribution arm in California, recently forecast that, 'if left unattended,
the used CD business will grow to about 20 per cent of unit volume by 1998'.
Small, independent music retailers have dealt in used CDs for some time. But
the stakes were raised last winter when Wherehouse Entertainment, a US west
coast chain, moved into the market. Wherehouse operates 339 outlets and was
the first retailer of any size to defy the distributors' wishes.
The wrath of some of the industry's biggest companies - such as CEMA, Sony
and Time Warner - descended. They withdrew advertising and promotional
support for all retailers dealing in second-hand CDs.
Wherehouse has fought back in the law courts. Last month, it launched a suit
against four of the biggest record distribution companies - CEMA, Sony Music
Distribution, UNI Distribution (part of MCA, now owned by Japan's
Matsushita) and Warner Elektra Atlantic.
In its complaint, the retailer alleges that prices of new CDs were being
maintained 'at artificially high levels', and that the four distributors had
'combined. . .unreasonably to restrain trade. . .in used CDs'.
It points out that the same distributors operate 'record clubs' which
advertise and sell CDs at a substantial discount to shop prices. Wherehouse
also argues that its own second-hand CD sales are an effort to stay
competitive with these record clubs. Distributors, it says, are worried that
the secondary market in CDs will threaten clubs' viability.
Wherehouse's legal action has been followed by the Independent Music
Retailers' Association - about 150-200 'mom and pop' music stores formed to
fight the distributors over second-hand CD sales. Like the Wherehouse suit,
IMRA's class action is filed in Los Angeles courts. It alleges price-fixing
and unfair trade practices.
Mr Don Rosenberg, one of IMRA's founders and owner of the 15-outlet chain
Record Exchange, says there is no law against selling second-hand CDs. He
also notes that the royalty issue has not stopped second-hand trading in
other industries.
Mr Rosenberg claims, more controversially, that the sale of second-hand CDs
does not depress new CD business, and points to his own stores' experience
as evidence. Here, big distributors beg to differ. 'There is no such thing
as a small sideline when you are taking royalties from artists, producers,
songwriter, publishers, musicians and artist managers, and taking margin
away from the record company,' claimed Mr Bach in Billboard magazine last
month.
'If used CDs hit the main record channels of America and become widely
accepted by consumers, and if CEMA supports retailers selling used CDs, then
we will be cutting off our own future.'
While the lawsuits grind on, the Federal Trade Commission is also understood
to be looking at the issue. In line with its usual practice, though, the
government anti-trust agency declines to confirm any specific investigation.
Not all distributors think like the retailers named in the Wherehouse suit.
Retailers say that PolyGram, for example, has a different policy, arising
from the notion that the industry must learn to live with sales of used CDs.
In London, PolyGram refused to comment.
Judging by the number of people in the downtown Manhattan store, there is no
doubt where consumers' sympathies lie. 'Customers love it,' says Wherehouse.
'As long as we're involved in a legal business and the distributors are
involved in illegal restraint, the lawsuits will continue'.

FT  20 AUG 93 / California retreats on taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CALIFORNIAN senate has agreed on changes to the state's controversial
system of corporate taxation and so may have helped to head off a
transatlantic tax war.
The state senate's committee on revenue and taxation has approved a bill
that would deal with three of the main complaints by foreign companies
against the way Californian corporate taxes are assessed.
The bill does not go as far as the British government has demanded. The UK
wants the state to eliminate the worldwide unitary assessment, by which
companies may be taxed on a proportion of the income they earn throughout
the world, rather than only on income earned in California.
State officials hope, even so, that the present legislation will be enough
to head off retaliation which the British government has threatened to
impose against Californian companies operating in the UK from January 1
next.
The UK has been embroiled with California over unitary taxation for years,
because of a decade-old lawsuit about the issue between Barclays Bank, the
British clearing bank, and the California Franchise Tax Board, which
collects the tax. The US Supreme Court is expected to decide this year
whether to hear the suit.
The Clinton administration has been unwilling to provoke a tax war with the
UK and perhaps the European Community, but also unwilling to abandon the
almost bankrupt state of California, which stands to lose as much as Dollars
3bn (Pounds 2bn) on the Barclays case and associated suits.
Californian politicians warned that the new bill - now generally expected to
win approval by the full state legislature and be ready for signature by
Governor Pete Wilson by mid-September - goes as far can realistically be
expected.
'The 1993 tax law of California will not contain a single thing that the
British government could object to, except for the very existence of
worldwide unitary taxation as an option for those companies that want it,'
said Mr Brad Sherman, a member of the tax board, who has been prominent in
seeking a way out of the California-UK impasse.
But British opponents of unitary taxation said the measure still did not
satisfy their concerns. 'It's fine as far as it goes but it doesn't go far
enough,' said Mr Peter Welch, chairman of the Unitary Tax Campaign, a
consortium of British companies opposing the Californian system.
California had already gone some way, in the 1980s, to meet objections to
the unitary system. Companies may now choose, instead of a unitary
assessment, to be taxed on a 'water's edge' basis, including only their
activities in the US.
The bill agreed by the revenue committee would remove three irritants which
remained: a fee charged to those who choose the water's edge system, which
brings the state about Dollars 45m a year; some complicated paperwork
imposed only on companies choosing water's edge; and the tax board's right
to override the choice of water's edge (a right it has never used).
The UK, however, had sought to have the unitary system eliminated and the
water's edge system made mandatory.

TURKEY and the European Community are negotiating a framework timetable for
the harmonisation of legislation, to pave the way for full customs union in
January 1995.
Turkish and EC trade officials have less than two months to agree a
legislative agenda to bring Turkish commercial and trade law in line with
the EC, before it is presented to the Turkish-EC Association Council meeting
on October 4.
The move is the final stage on the road to customs union which is seen by
Turkey as a step towards full EC membership.
Turkey's formal application for EC membership was presented in 1987 and
politely shelved in 1989.
But Turkish officials are increasingly concerned that, in the process of EC
'enlargement', Turkey is being overtaken in the queue by central and eastern
European countries.
Average protection rates for EC industrial goods are around 15 per cent,
according to EC calculations.
Under the additional protocol to Turkey's 1964 Agreement of Association, to
achieve a customs union Turkey has to reduce import duties on EC goods to
zero and adopt the community's common external tariff

FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Focus of S Africa reforms shifts to trade
 -The revised offer to be presented to Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN South Africa started on the road of political reform in 1990, this was
as much a function of the crippling economic cost of apartheid as it was a
reflection of the moral and political bankruptcy of that policy.
Since then, the country's faltering political fortunes have hogged the
limelight. Later this month, however, South Africa will present a revised
trade liberalisation offer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), which forms part of a revision of trade policy as fundamental as the
political reform under way.
Mr Stef Naude, director general of the Department of Trade and Industry,
comments: 'Without a doubt, this is the biggest reform of trade policy ever
undertaken in this country.'
The aim of the reform is simple: the transformation of the existing
industrial base, fed for decades on a diet of political isolation, import
substitution and strategic self-sufficiency, into an internationally
competitive, export-led manufacturing sector.
The Gatt offer is but the first of many initiatives which include reform of
export incentives, investigation of export processing zones, more efficient
anti-dumping legislation, a trade agreement with the EC and the future of
the South African Customs Union.
Pursued against the background of a weak economy, unemployment running at
over 40 per cent and fundamental political transition, it is a Herculean
labour.
No longer can government unilaterally decree policy changes. Democracy,
transparency and consultation are the new watchwords. When it comes to
economic policy, the imprimatur of the National Economic Forum, the
tripartite body where business, labour and government are represented, must
be sought.
At least in the area of trade policy, there is fairly broad consensus among
these three groups as to the way forward. Nobody would argue with the
premise, contained in the government's recently published Normative Economic
Model, that 'Much of the country's future economic prosperity will be
determined by its ability to play a bigger role in international trade in
industrial goods.'
This clearly requires conformity to Gatt, whose signatories all benefit from
'most favoured nation' status and 'national treatment' - the first ensuring
that any tariff cut offered by one country to a second must automatically be
extended to all other trading partners, and the second guaranteeing that an
exporter is treated just as a local company is treated.
'There is no way South Africa can fully reintegrate into the global economy
outside Gatt,' said Mr Stef Naude.
Conformity to Gatt is not the only reason for lowering tariff barriers. It
is also necessary to remove the anti-export bias in South Africa whereby
protection makes the local market more profitable than exports.
It also raises input costs for local exporters, making them uncompetitive
compared to exporters elsewhere who can obtain inputs at world prices.
A recent World Bank study of South Africa's trade policy found that it was
not overly protective, 'but far too fluid and complex, and biased against
exports.' Compared to developing countries, the protection level is fairly
average. According to NEM, South Africa's tariff barrier (weighted by import
values) stands at 21 per cent, though this rises to 27 per cent when account
is taken of special import surcharges  - which survive for fiscal rather
than protection purposes.
South Africa's revised Gatt offer will thus have two main features: first,
it will involve a one-third reduction in average tariff rates. Second, it
includes a dramatic rationalisation of the tariff structure which is
virtually unmatched in its complexity.
Instead of the current high degree of dispersion, tariff levels will range,
at 5 percentage point intervals, from zero to a maximum of 30 per cent (with
the exception of the motor industry).
Also, almost all tariffs will be bound - which means, in theory, they can
never be raised, only lowered. This compares with only 55 per cent in its
original offer.
South Africa has also committed itself to phasing out emergency dumping
formula duties, - a measure which has been the main instrument to counter
disruptive competition. to be replaced by proper anti-dumping measures,
further reducing the overall level of protection in the country as formula
duties often resulted in an increased overall level of protection.
The Gatt offer - particularly the lowering of import tariffs - should not be
seen in isolation. All parties agree that it will have to be accompanied by
supply-side support measures to assist local industry to improve its
competitiveness. With unemployment already at alarmingly high levels, the
social and political costs of simply dropping tariff barriers, without other
policies introduced in parallel, are unthinkable.

FT  20 AUG 93 / BAe deal in Taiwan less sure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace conceded yesterday that talks on finalising arrangements
for a Pounds 250m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) were
'taking longer than we had anticipated'.
BAe, which three weeks ago said it regarded the deal as a certainty, was
responding to reports that Mr Yang Shih-chien, the Taiwanese vice economics
minister, had said the deal could still collapse.
Mr Yang has been closely involved in the establishment of the venture and
blamed differences over the financing of the joint venture, called Avro. BAe
said that this was the main subject of the talks still to be resolved.
BAe shares fell 14p to 454p on the news because the deal is central to BAe's
drive to return to profitability. It would mean manufacture of the RJ range
of regional jets would be partly carried on in Taiwan, which is close to the
fast-growing east Asia markets and which offers lower labour costs.
The stumbling block in the talks is thought to concern collateral for loans
to Avro. Several banks both own stakes in Avro and are lending it money. But
Taiwan law prohibits a bank from extending unsecured financing to a venture
in which it holds more than 3 per cent.
Behind this obstacle lies concern among some Taiwan investors that the
project might not make money. One of the reasons BAe needs a partner with
strong manufacturing capability and access to markets is that its regional
aircraft business has lost money for several years.
TAC, 29 per cent owned by the government, and British Aerospace signed an
agreement in January 1993 to form a 50-50 venture making the RJ family of
regional passenger jets, which would be assembled in Taiwan and the UK.
Mr Yang last month confirmed that the government would increase its direct
equity holding in TAC to 39 per cent.
This holding will be through two bodies: a government development fund,
which will lift its stake in TAC from 24 per cent to 29 per cent, and the
state-run Chiao Tung Bank, which will raise its stake from 5 to 10 per cent.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Israel writhes under the goad of Hizbollah: Armed conflict
risks overtaking diplomatic peace efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S problems in southern Lebanon refuse to go away. Just as the Jewish
state was congratulating itself on last month's devastating seven-day
offensive against Lebanese civilians, intended to curb attacks by the
pro-Iranian Hizbollah militia, an increase in regional violence is back on
the agenda.
The death of at least eight Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon yesterday
in two Hizbollah attacks, the first of which was followed by immediate
retaliatory strikes by Israeli aircraft, has underlined the continuing
fragility of the region.
It has also raised the prospect of armed conflict overtaking diplomatic
peace efforts and re-opened the fault lines between Israelis who argue for a
more intensive peace drive and those calling for tougher military measures.
Once again violence in southern Lebanon is driving Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, to weigh up (for the second time in a month)
whether to pursue the diplomatic track or risk scuttling peace talks by more
serious military action.
Suspicions that Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon and the arms conduit
to Hizbollah, tacitly allowed yesterday's attacks have also dented Israeli
hopes of a real change in relations with Damascus. Israelis point out that
yesterday's attacks came after Syria reprimanded the Lebanese government for
deploying troops in southern Lebanon - a move which could have restricted
Hizbollah activities.
For 15 years, Israel, in defiance of UN resolutions, has been trying to
'purge' Lebanon of hostile Arab guerrillas. Today that goal is as elusive as
it was when Israeli soldiers first crossed in substantial force into
Lebanese territory in 1978, and later, in 1982, marched all the way to
Beirut.
Indeed, many Israeli military experts believe the country is now facing its
most effective enemy in Hizbollah, which took over resistance to Israel
after most Palestinian guerrillas were forced to flee Lebanon during the
1982 Israeli invasion.
This year alone there have been more than 600 attacks on the self-styled
Israeli 'security zone' in southern Lebanon. Yesterday's incidents brought
the casualties for 1993 to at least 17 soldiers killed and 31 wounded.
Furthermore, Israeli military analysts say the highly mobile Hizbollah is
much better armed this year, with Iranian supplied Sagger anti-tank missiles
and Strela shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles. With the assistance of
Iranian officers, it is also better trained.
The Israeli public has come to expect revenge attacks and the pressures for
serious military action is especially intense given that the government has
been telling the public that last month's offensive, in which 130 Lebanese
were killed, was a decisive blow against Hizbollah.
Mr Rabin, a former army chief who embodies the belief that diplomacy must be
backed by force, will also come under intense lobbying from military
hardliners and Israeli hawks led by Mr Ariel Sharon, the former defence
minister responsible for the disastrous 1982 invasion.
Mr Sharon has called for an expansion of the security zone by the creation
of a 'supplementary zone' between the Litani and Awali rivers where Israeli
troops and their Lebanese proxies would have freedom of action without
maintaining a military presence. 'Villages in the zone which have concealed
terrorists for years should no longer be left standing,' he wrote recently.
Few Israelis back Mr Sharon's military adventurism. Most fear being sucked
into another Lebanese quagmire like the 1982-85 campaign, where 654 Israeli
soldiers died and thousands were wounded.
But many also believe that Israeli aerial and artillery retaliation leave
the underlying problems unsolved. Some hardliners, therefore, see an answer
to the problems in suspending peace talks with Syria.
'More Israeli retaliation is futile. We should tell Syria to go to hell,'
said Brig Gen (Res) Aharon Levran, former deputy head of military
intelligence. 'Hizbollah is a whip in Syrian hands to hurt Israel and we
should not talk peace with them any more. The problem is that this
government wants peace at any price. They want to put their names in the
annals of history and they don't give a damm about the true and cruel
realities.'
However, a majority of the government and the public still recognise that
only a comprehensive Middle East peace deal will solve Israel's problems in
southern Lebanon. 'We must prevent ourselves being tempted into deeper
military involvement in Lebanon or we will have casualties like this every
day,' said Mr Ran Cohen, an MP from the left-wing Meretz party. 'Military
action will not stop the violence; only a peace agreement will stop it. This
is the only way.'
Attacks by Hizbollah, combined with suspicions of Syria, weaken the voices
of reason and moderation in Israel and threaten wider conflict. But the
lesson of Israel's actions in Lebanon in the 1970s and 1980s is apparent to
all but the most diehard Israelis: that violence is no substitute for
genuine negotiation. Israelis who are seriously committed to peace hope the
same message is understood in Syria.

<TEXT>
THE Pakistani government last night announced a package of economic reforms,
imposing taxes on the politically influential feudal landowners.
Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister who is due to remain in power
till the October 6 elections, also promised to take punitive action against
tax evaders and those with unpaid utility bills.
He also announced a plan to reduce import tariffs to an average of between
35 and 50 per cent over the next three years. Tariffs now average more than
90 per cent.
The televised speech ended several days of speculation over the package,
which aims to curtail Pakistan's budget deficit. In the past, successive
Pakistani governments have failed to introduce steps such the imposition of
income taxes on farmers because of the farmers' political clout.
'We are fully prepared to take the politically tough decisions that we
believe are necessary to put Pakistan back on the road to prosperity,' said
Mr Qureshi.
He also announced wage increases for low-paid government servants and
promised to introduce a new system of social security for the poor.
Implementation of some of the reforms may extend beyond Mr Qureshi's term in
office but his successors are expected to continue with the programme,
officials said.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Indian TV launches a real carry-on: Producers' fight for air
time descends into farce
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE launch of five new television channels last Sunday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Independence Day - gave Indians a freedom long denied them by Doordarshan,
the country's state-owned broadcaster.
It was responding belatedly to the challenge of Star Television, the Hong
Kong-based satellite broadcaster which has attracted a huge audience in
India with its five channels: entertainment in English and Hindi, an Asian
version of the MTV music channel, sport and BBC World Service Television.
However, the new offerings from Doordarshan, an unwieldy, bureaucratic
organisation which previously had only two terrestrial channels, did not
begin auspiciously.
Those fortunate enough to have an additional satellite dish jeered the menu
of old Indian films and dated programmes from the archives.
In line with the government's programme to open up the economy, the launch
of the satellite network using India's new Insat-2B satellite had been
intended to coincide with much greater use of privately produced material.
But Doordarshan's attempt to offer slots to producers on a
first-come-first-served basis has descended into farce.
Fearing they would be elbowed out by a rush of more aggressive bidders,
seasoned producers, such as Mr Prannoy Roy of New Delhi Television and Mr
Ishwari Bajpai of Octave Communications, deputed employees to queue outside
Doordarshan's commercial office on Delhi's Tolstoy Marg on June 23, nearly
two weeks before what was then the applications deadline.
The queue became longer by the day as more than 300 people braved the
monsoon rain. Producers say their men have been offered up to Rs50,000
(about Pounds 1,100) to relinquish their places.
Those left out took the matter to the courts. Bennett Coleman, owners of
Times Television and the Times of India group of publications, challenged
the queue's validity. An interim district court judgment ordered police to
dismantle it, allowing it to be re-formed two hours before the opening of
the applications counter.
The queue refused to disperse. Mr Roy went to the Delhi High Court, which
appointed a registrar to verify the truth. Prominent film and television
personalities, such as Bombay film producers Ramanand Sagar and Saeed Myrpa,
and television magazine producers Madhu Trehan and Karan Thapar, have turned
the sidewalk into a tourist attraction.
Two parallel queues have formed, one of which includes representatives from
newspapers including the Indian Express, Times of India, and Hindustan
Times. The battle, waged with equal ferocity in the courtrooms as in the
columns of the newspapers, remains unresolved.
The Information and Broadcasting Ministry, however, had promised to launch
the new channels on Independence Day. It was forced to assure the courts
that it would use only in-house programming.
Doordarshan is finding it difficult to keep pace with the appetite of the
new channels. 'It's like expecting a roadside food vendor to cater to a
five-star hotel clientele,' says a senior official.
Doordarshan is paying for its dismissal two years ago of Star TV as a
'one-day wonder', a luxury that only a handful of the country's elite would
be able to indulge in. Star TV, 64 per cent of which was recently bought by
Mr Rupert Murdoch, now has an Indian audience of 18.8m. Though Doordarshan's
reach remains enormously bigger than Star's, the Hong Kong-based network
will be the biggest competitor for advertising revenue.
Other adversaries are emerging in Asian skies, including:
A consortium comprising Time Warner's HBO Asia, with access to Warner
Brothers and Paramount films; Turner Broadcasting Systems, which owns CNN;
ESPN International, the sports network; Viacom, owners of MTV; Australia's
AUSTV; and Hong Kong's TVB.
The Asia Television Network, which has a bank of more than 3,000 Hindi films
through an arrangement with Cable Master, a video film company, and a tie-up
with Sun TV of Madras to screen films in regional languages.
Regional language channels such as Asianet, which will beam programmes in
Malayalam, the language of Kerala, starting on August 29, through
transponders hired from the Russian Ekran satellite.
'Even three years ago, we had the chance to lead the wave of government
deregulation and enhanced technology in Asia, but we did little to
capitalise on it,' admits a Doordarshan official. 'Now that we have woken up
to the fact that Asia is indeed television's most exciting frontier, and
India is one of its largest audiences, we will have to make up for lost
time.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA may suffer a 10 per cent financing gap in its annual budget as a
result of the Japanese yen's appreciation and lower than expected oil
prices.
Economists estimate that 40 per cent of Indonesia's Dollars 55bn (Pounds
37bn) foreign public debt is denominated in yen. Interest and principal
repayments for fiscal 1993 were budgeted at Dollars 8bn but with the yen's
appreciation could rise to nearly Dollars 9bn, say economists in Jakarta.
While about a third of Indonesia's exports go to Japan, the three main items
 -oil, liquefied natural gas and plywood - are traded in US dollars.
Indonesia, therefore, has to buy yen to service its yen-denominated debt.
Meanwhile, the average oil price since April has been less than the Dollars
18 per barrel assumed under the 1993 budget.

US AIRCRAFT attacked and destroyed an Iraqi missile position just west of
the northern city of Mosul yesterday, according to the Pentagon in
Washington.
Six aircraft were involved in the attack, which was made in response to the
launching of two Sam-3 missiles. The US statement did not say whether the
missiles had been aimed at the aircraft.
An Iraqi spokesman in Baghdad claimed that the US attack had been unprovoked
and its anti-aircraft battery had opened fire in self defence. He added that
a soldier and a civilian had been wounded.
Mosul is within the air exclusion zone north of the 36th parallel, which US
aircraft patrol daily to protect the Kurdish population. The northern
'no-fly' zone was imposed more than two years ago.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Tokyo orders blitz against regulations
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new coalition government promised yesterday to produce within a
month an emergency programme aimed at deregulating the economy.
Its intention is both to curb the rise of the yen and ensure that the
benefits of the currency's present strength are felt by consumers.
Each ministry is being told to identify regulations that could be lifted to
achieve these ends - ranging from import barriers to price controls. The
electricity power federation last night yielded to official pressure to cut
its charges, in order to reflect cheaper imported energy.
The initiative, decided at the first meeting yesterday of a special
ministerial council on the economy, followed persistent calls for action
from industry, which is suffering under the twin burdens of a prolonged
slowdown at home and a currency squeeze on export earnings.
The move also reflects the wish of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who became prime
minister last week and chaired yesterday's meeting, to tilt the balance of
economic power in Japan from producer to consumer.
His seven-party administration was elected on a platform of political
reform, but Mr Masayoshi Takemura, its chief spokesman, acknowledged
yesterday that the state of the economy and the foreign exchange markets
meant 'we are now snowed under by these daily issues instead'.
Mr Hosokawa later met Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren, the largest
business federation, and agreed the yen had gone further than economic
fundamentals justified.
The government appeared not yet to have decided whether the measures put in
train yesterday, which it said would be ready by September 20, should
include a fiscal stimulus. Mr Takemura said only that ministers would seek
to ensure that two packages of public works spending and tax cuts, unveiled
in the past year by the previous Liberal Democratic government and totalling
Y23,900bn (Pounds 157bn), had their desired effect.
By contrast, the electric power federation said its plan to cut consumers'
bills would put just Y150bn into the economy.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, endorsed the view expressed on
Wednesday by Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, that no
further cut in the central bank's official discount rate from its present
2.5 per cent was yet needed.
Mr Takemura admitted that there were 'wide-ranging viewpoints' at the
meeting.
Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the economic planning agency, said the
EPA would not withdraw a declaration made in June that the economy had
bottomed out, although acknowledging 'new unfavourable factors'. These
included the dampening effects on consumer spending of a cool summer, as
well as the impact on international competitiveness of the yen's further
rise.
Mr Fujii, citing the same factors, said they made the outlook 'even more
austere'. The best way to deal with it was by passing on its benefits to
consumers, he added. The yen fell against the dollar after the meeting,
closing in Tokyo at Y101.98 after trading as high as Y101.10. It was down
Y0.51 on the day.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Aids saps the vitality of Uganda's economy: The many family
tragedies making a national disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAKABUBI'S village was in mourning last month. Nobody grieved for the death
of yet another Aids victim more than this 31-year-old widow. Her husband had
already died of Aids, and this latest victim was godfather to her youngest
son. He had promised to help with school fees. Now he is dead, Nakabubi must
struggle alone.
Most of the widows in villages across western Uganda have lost their
husbands to Aids. And in a country were women are regarded as chattels,
widows often lose more than just their husbands.
Another widow, Mabel, was evicted from the family home by her in-laws when
her husband died in 1990. They also sold her cows, 'to pay for my husband's
hospital bills'. When she clung to a small banana plot, her brother-in-law
stole the harvest. When she, too, fell sick, the same man took her four
children away. 'If I could only earn a little money,' she says, 'I could get
my children back. Give them love while I live.'
The southern districts of Masaka and Rakai, once known as the granary of
Uganda, bear the heaviest burden of the Aids epidemic outside Kampala, the
capital. Out of the 38,552 Aids cases reported in Uganda by the end of last
year, almost 8,500 were in these two districts.
Every family knows of a relative or a friend afflicted by the condition.
Production of the two main cash crops, coffee and bananas, is dwindling
because Aids is attacking adults in the prime of life. Often, the surviving
partner also has the virus and chooses to expend his or her dwindling
energies producing food crops for the family's subsistence.
Health workers in Masaka say the disease is killing what was a thriving
market town. 'With fewer farmers coming to market, the town merchants are
going out of business or cutting their losses by moving to Kampala,' says Mr
Elias Mugisha, an Aids counsellor who works for TASO, a Ugandan
non-government organisation which cares for Aids and HIV sufferers.
The World Bank, which plans to finance a study on the impact of Aids on the
Ugandan economy, estimates Aids-related deaths will reduce Uganda's
population growth rate from 3.7 to 3.1 per cent from 1995 to the turn of the
century. The crude death rate, which at 20 per 1,000 is already twice the
average among low-income countries, is likely to rise to 26 per 1,000 during
this period.
The deaths are sapping the strength of Uganda's predominantly rural economy.
'Agriculture is suffering,' says Mr Keith Muhakanizi, an economist at the
Finance Ministry. 'As yet, I don't have macro-economic data to sustain this
assertion, but a trip to any village will bear this out. Cash crops are
being abandoned in favour of essential food crops as labour loses
productivity.'
Exports of coffee, Uganda's main cash crop, have fallen from a recent peak
of 176,453 tonnes in 1989 to 123,883 tonnes last year. But low commodity
prices and bad weather have also contributed to the decline.
Beyond issues of output and productivity, Mr Muhakanizi says the cost of
caring for Aids patients is eating up people's savings, leaving less to
invest in economic development.
Government and non-government organisations report that families resent
spending their meagre resources on medication for patients they know will
die. Where charities try to provide bed sheets and other basic comforts for
Aids sufferers, they often find that relatives sell the donated goods to
recoup the cost of caring for the patient.
Aids is also putting an intolerable strain on the extended family network,
which is the only form of social insurance most Africans have. In Uganda,
where annual per capita income is a mere Dollars 167, one of the lowest in
sub-Saharan Africa, the responsibility for housing, feeding, clothing and
educating Aids orphans is often beyond the means of most rural households.
The problem is not confined to rural areas. 'One of our best-trained
economists died of Aids last month,' Mr Muhakanizi regrets. He says
companies are likewise losing skilled workers and can no longer afford to
provide medical care schemes. 'Even our surplus labour will not alleviate
the problem in the long run,' he says.
Mr Manuel Pinto, the director of Uganda's Aids Control Programme, has
resigned himself to the fact that the disease will continue to be the main
killer in Uganda for the foreseeable future. 'Aids takes a long time to
manifest itself, so we are a long way away from seeing the reversal of the
epidemic, or the fruits of our prevention efforts,' he says. The rate of HIV
infection varies from 5 per cent in some rural areas to 30 per cent in urban
areas, and according to government data it is still rising.
'Children are our window of hope,' Mr Pinto says. 'We are trying to educate
those between the ages of five and 15 so that they are kept free from Aids.'
The problem is compounded by the practice of polygamy and the low status of
women in Ugandan society. But slowly, Mr Pinto believes, the government is
getting its educational message across. Agencies such as TASO report that
polygamy in the countryside is on the wane, and that more people are using
condoms.

The United Nations yesterday agreed fresh aid for Angola, as the government
reported that people were starving in the besieged city of Cuito, Reuter
reports from Luanda. The UN World Food Programme said it would mount a
six-month Dollars 56.7m (Pounds 38m) emergency operation for nearly 2m
people in Angola.
The WFP had suspended flights to many cities for several weeks, including
Cuito, because of attacks on its aircraft by Unita rebels, but a WFP
spokeswoman said aid flights had resumed this week and the agency was
increasing overland deliveries.

The former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan yesterday announced it would
issue a national currency at par to the dollar on November 1, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
President Saparmurad Niyazov, of the Central Asian republic, which is the
world's third biggest gas producer, said Russian roubles would be gradually
replaced at an exchange rate of 1,000 roubles to each unit of the new
currency, the manat.
Mr Niyazov, quoted by the Russian Interfax news agency, did not say how the
government would back the manat at this rate, or how much Turkmenistan had
in foreign currency reserves.
Mr Niyazov promised that the minimum monthly wage would be 150 manats and
average pay the equivalent of Dollars 370 to Dollars 400 after the exit from
the rouble zone takes effect.

TAIWAN'S President Lee Teng-hui yesterday suffered a setback in his efforts
to replace conservatives on the ruling Kuomintang or National party central
committee with more progressive politicians, writes Dennis Engbarth from
Taipei.
Of the president's 210 nominees for the central committee, 58 lost in the
elections at the party's 14th congress.
Mr Hsieh Shen-shan, deputy secretary general of the party, said that,
'facing a new situation and fierce competition', the fact that 72.3 per cent
of nominees were elected 'was a success'.
But conservative delegates critical of Mr Lee gained between 35 and 40 seats
on the central committee.
This showing should be sufficient to secure several seats on the central
standing committee, the Kuomintang's top policy-making body, which the
central committee will elect next Monday.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Turkey wants to open Iraq oil pipe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY is to urge the UN to lift sanctions on Iraq's oil export pipeline, in
the first sign of a shift in Ankara's policy towards Baghdad.
Mr Vulkan Vural, senior adviser to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, said
yesterday reopening the Iraqi pipeline was the foreign policy priority, and
would be the centre of discussion when Mrs Ciller goes to Washington next
month.
Although Turkey insists it is not considering unilateral action on lifting
sanctions, Mrs Ciller's government has adopted a more conciliatory approach,
in contrast to President Suleyman Demirel, who made oblique criticism of the
government this week.
'Have sanctions removed Saddam Hussein or have they led to the suffering of
the Iraqi people?' asked Mr Vural.
A recent report from the Food and Agricultural Organisation estimated Iraq's
food import needs at around Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn), and warned that
pre-famine conditions now prevailed.
However, Turkey is equally anxious that the current crisis should not
jeopardise its long-term economic relations with Iraq, which before the Gulf
war was its second largest trade partner. There is also concern at the
deteriorating state of the pipeline, which has been shut since August 1990,
when under resolution 661, Turkey informed the Iraqis it was suspending
loadings at Yumurtalik, Turkey's Mediterranean oil terminal.
The two pipelines have a capacity of around 76m tonnes a year, and link with
Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields. Turkey is losing an estimated Dollars 750,000 a
day as a result of the closure. More than that, the sanctions have
devastated the border trade with Iraq that is vital to Turkey's impoverished
south east.
'The members of the Security Council should understand that it is unfair to
make Turkey suffer for this,' Mr Vural said.
Turkey is launching 'extensive discussions' with its allies, he said, and
would present its proposals when the UN Security council met on Iraq on
September 20.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Last strike ends at Hyundai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 10-WEEK round of strikes at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate,
finally ended yesterday when 52 per cent of the workers at its shipbuilding
subsidiary agreed a pay pact.
Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) was the last of nine Hyundai companies to
resolve the labour strife that first began on June 5.
Hyundai is estimated to have lost Won900bn (Pounds 760m) in sales as a
result of the industrial action, which involved 60,000 workers.
The action has affected the Korean economy. When the central bank recently
reduced its 1993 GNP growth forecast from 6 per cent to 5.7 per cent, it
largely blamed the Hyundai strikes for the revision.
The Hyundai workers were mostly unsuccessful in achieving their demands
during wage negotiations.
They struck for an average pay increase of 16 per cent, although most
finally settled for the 4.7 per cent wage raise offered by management, in
addition to production bonuses and fringe benefits.
Workers were also forced to abandon their demands for a working week of 40
hours instead of 44 hours and a say in management and personnel decisions.
HHI workers agreed to end their strike, which began on July 5, after the
government threatened to intervene tomorrow and impose a 20-day cooling-off
period.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday continued its cautious repair of the damage
caused by the European currency crisis by lowering overnight interest rates
for the fourth time in 10 days. The rate was trimmed by half a point to 8.25
per cent.
However, the bank left its key intervention rate at 6.75 per cent and also
held the 5-10 day lending facility at 10 per cent. Economists suspect that
the French are awaiting the outcome of next Thursday's meeting of the
Bundesbank council.
Although the franc has stabilised this week, the central bank's own
financial position still shows the strain of the crisis. The bank yesterday
disclosed only a slight reduction in the deficit on its foreign currency
reserves, to FFr175bn in the week to August 12 from FFr188bn in the previous
week.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, yesterday warned of the
'grave disruptions' which can occur on financial markets if high
expectations of interest rate cuts are not fulfilled.
In remarks reported by a German news agency, he said that the currency
market upheaval of recent weeks 'should make it clear to everyone' what
happens when markets are fed with unrealistic expectations.
His comments appear targeted at the many German banks which are expecting a
cut in the discount rate after next Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Oil companies resume Azeri talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS have re-opened in London between a group of eight foreign oil
companies and officials from Azerbaijan over a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn)
oilfield development in the Caspian Sea.
The Azeri government is understood to have agreed that the project be
discussed as a joint development between the companies, rather than holding
separate negotiations for the three fields, which are estimated to contain
4.5bn barrels of oil.
The talks had been put on ice during the political upheaval in Azerbaijan in
June when the republic's leader, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, fled the capital and
was replaced by Mr Gaidar Aliyev, an official from the Brezhnev era.
Mr Aliyev officially relaunched the negotiating process 10 days ago in Baku,
although the oil companies had been talking to Azeri officials in New York
in the interim. Mr Aliyev said he would like to see a deal agreed by the end
of September, but many details must still be finalised. The Azeri delegation
in London is led by Mr Marat Manafov, an Azeri businessman with strong links
to the west. He is being advised by seven oil industry experts from the US,
Canada and the UK. The appointment of Mr Manafov has encouraged some of the
oil company representatives, who now have a single point of contact with the
Azeris with a mandate to secure a deal.
Mr Aliyev is understood to have offered either to return a Dollars 70m
pre-payment made by the companies or to offset it against future costs. The
companies are also talking about the route for an export pipeline.
Four possible plans are under negotiation.
The companies involved in the talks include: Amoco, British Petroleum,
Statoil, Pennzoil, Ramco, Turkish Petroleum, Unocal and McDermott.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Ford-Werke chief fights decision to move him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, yesterday became embroiled in public conflict with
one of its top executives in Germany, in its latest shake-up of the group's
European management. Mr John Hardiman, who was dismissed this week as
chairman of the Ford-Werke management board, is considering taking legal
action for breach of contract.
On Wednesday Ford of Europe announced that Mr Hardiman would return to the
US to a position in Ford's international automotive operations.
He was to be replaced immediately by Mr Albert Caspers, Ford of Europe
manufacturing director, who was to add the chairmanship of the German
subsidiary to his existing role.
Mr Hardiman's lawyer announced yesterday that the Ford executive might seek
a temporary injunction against his dismissal in order to force his
reinstatement.
'Mr Hardiman's contract runs to the end of April 1995 and under German law
such a contract can only be ended for gross misconduct, which nobody is
claiming,' he said. Mr Hardiman had a written contract with Ford-Werke not
with Ford of Europe or with Ford of the US.
He said the first Mr Hardiman had heard of his impending dismissal was from
newspaper reports in Germany last week.
Ford of Europe is fighting to overcome its third year of heavy losses and is
in the process of drastic restructuring including the cutting of around
10,000 jobs across its European operations.
The company has run up heavy losses particularly in Britain and in Germany,
where Ford-Werke suffered a net loss of DM469m last year.
Mr Hardiman, 59, has worked for Ford in Europe for more than 30 years. He
became chief executive of Ford-Werke in 1989.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Izetbegovic expects no quick deal

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday dismissed hopes of a quick
settlement to the 17-month war after the presidents of Serbia and Croatia
joined talks on the republic's ethnic partition. 'I do not expect the
successful conclusion of negotiations very soon,' he said after almost five
hours of meetings with his Serb and Croat adversaries.
His remarks came as the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his
Croat counterpart, Mr Franjo Tudjman, returned to Geneva to join all-party
talks, in a move which was hoped would give fresh impetus to the peace
process. Earlier Lord Owen, the international mediator, indicated he was
making a final push to broker an accord 'in the next few days' - although he
conceded that problems remained over the boundaries of the future
partitions.
Mr Milosevic left a private meeting with Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, last night calling today 'a very critical day'. Serb sources said Mr
Karadzic had offered, with the Croats, to give the Moslems 32 per cent of
Bosnian territory, 2 per cent up on the original offer but far short of the
40 per cent Mr Izetbegovic is demanding. The sources also said that Serbs
and Croats had ironed out their territorial disputes.
Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, yesterday repeated that he would refuse to endorse
any peace agreement that had not been previously approved by the Bosnian
parliament, and demanded that the Serb forces lift their siege round
Sarajevo.
With the threat of air strikes now receding, a UN spokesman in New York last
night emphasised that although the UN now had the capability to use air
power, that did not mean such action was imminent.
But as a sign of the diplomatic pressure against air strikes, President
Boris Yeltsin yesterday took credit for the fact that neither the UN nor
Nato had employed force against Serbia and suggested that it might soon be
possible to lift sanctions against Serbia. If negotiations were proceeding
'it will be necessary to reconsider the sanctions against Yugoslavia', he
said.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE UN EFFORT IN BOSNIA: SOME SUCCESS IN SARAJEVO BUT THE SIEGES SPREAD
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bosnian government yesterday called on the UN to open the road to
  Mostar, where 35,000 Moslems have been trapped for 100 days by
  fighting between Croats and Moslems. For their part, UN officials
  reiterated that, without rapid widespread aid, Bosnia could soon face
  an even more severe humanitarian crisis. Though the siege of Sarajevo
  had been the main focus of attention, UN officials said the biggest
  problem now was fighting in central Bosnia. It was little-known
  regions such as Maglaj, Jablanica and Mostar that were the new trouble
  spots.
An official said: 'All over Bosnia there are tiny pockets that the
  outside world just doesn't know about. There the humanitarian
  conditions are terrible.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SARAJEVO                 This city is now better supplied than many: 16
                         air-lifts a day are providing almost all of the
                         nearly 5,000 tonnes of food the UN estimates is
                         needed each month. Fuel, medical supplies and
                         water remain low, but six fuel convoys reached
                         the city last week, enabling water pumps to
                         start working.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SREBRENICA, GORAZDE      Food convoys are reaching the 60,000 people in
  AND ZEPA               the Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa,
                         surrounded by Serbs. Civilian protesters have
                         been blocking some convoys to Gorazde, but air
                         drops are providing basic supplies to the
                         70,000 there. Srebrenica still faces severe
                         water problems, and there is serious
                         over-crowding in all three towns.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
BANJA LUKA REGION        Conditions in this Serb-held area seem
                         relatively stable, although reports suggest
                         'ethnic cleansing' continues, with large
                         refugee movement. Convoys reach the city
                         easily, and a key UN warehouse has been
                         established in the city.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TUZLA                    Despite concerns about the largely Moslem
                         population, which is partly surrounded by Serb
                         forces, food convoys are reaching the area.
                         There is a large UN warehouse.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MAGLAJ                   This isolated Moslem enclave has been cut off
                         for several weeks by Serbs and Croats. There is
                         deep concern about the estimated 40,000 Moslems
                         here.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TARCIN AND JABLANICA     Fighting between Croats and Moslems has left
                         these Moslem-dominated towns severely short of
                         food and water. Despite one food convoy getting
                         through recently and some air drops, the
                         situation is reported as serious.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MOSTAR                   A Croat offensive has prevented aid from
                         reaching the city for 100 days. Its 35,000
                         Moslem inhabitants are reportedly becoming
                         critically short of food and water. There is
                         Red Cross concern about detention camps near
                         the city.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
VARES                    The Croat enclave faces severe problems of
                         overcrowding: originally supporting some 7,000
                         people, it is reported to have more than 20,000
                         refugees living in precarious conditions. The
                         UN is attempting air drops.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
GORNJI VAKUF REGION      Renewed fighting between Moslems and Croats has
                         isolated many communities. After UN officials
                         were recently attacked, aid groups say the area
                         is becoming too dangerous to operate in.

border, writes Chrystia Freeland in Moscow and agencies.
If the Armenian forces - pushing down from the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh - reach the border they will cut off a huge swathe of
southern Azerbaijan. According to a statement released by the Azeris,
Armenian forces are advancing toward the town of Goradiz, just 5km from
Iran. Armenia's capture of Cebrayil is the most recent in a series of
Armenian victories.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE top echelons of France's financial administration are preparing for a
round of musical chairs following Mr Jacques de Larosiere's appointment as
head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The most important move will be a replacement for Mr de Larosiere as
governor of the Bank of France. The central bank is in the process of being
granted autonomy in the formulation of monetary policy and the new governor
will take control at a particularly difficult time following the European
currency crisis which has resulted in the effective flotation of the French
franc.
The favourite for the post is Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, currently director of
the French Treasury, the most powerful civil service post in France's
financial administration. His selection as head of the central bank would
trigger a further reshuffle within the Treasury.
The decision on the next central bank governor will be taken by the cabinet
and President Francois Mitterrand meeting as the council of ministers on
August 25. But bankers and diplomats in Paris say that Mr Trichet faces
little opposition for the post.
'He would seem to be the natural choice,' says one French banker. 'He has
the right background and the right views.' Mr Trichet served as senior aide
to Mr Edouard Balladur, the current prime minister, when he was economics
minister in 1986 and 1987.
The implementation of laws granting the central bank independence in
monetary policy is expected by the end of the year. The French government
has promoted the reform in order to strengthen the financial authorities'
anti-inflationary credentials. But the task of maintaining a tight monetary
policy will be complicated by pressures for more expansionary policies to
help stimulate the economy and by the increased instability of the franc
resulting from the ERM reforms.
Should Mr Trichet become the governor of the Bank of France, there is no
clear candidate to replace him as head of the Treasury. One name mentioned
in French financial circles is that of Mr Christian Noyer, the chief of
staff of Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Progress claimed in VW 'spying' probe

<TEXT>
GERMAN prosecutors investigating allegations of industrial espionage by
senior Volkswagen employees have made progress following up new clues,
according to Mr Thomas Seifert, head of the economic crimes division in the
Darmstadt public prosecutors' office.
His comments yesterday fuelled speculation that the criminal probe is
entering a decisive phase.
Further witnesses have been interrogated, while evidence from 'top-class and
important' witnesses from Volkswagen has yielded nothing to persuade
investigators to call off the probe, Mr Seifert said.
The investigation is believed to have focused in recent days on reports that
11 VW trainees were instructed to punch GM and Opel data into the German
group's computers at the end of March. 'Naturally we are following this
trail,' Mr Seifert said.
Opel asked for the launch of a criminal inquiry in late April, following the
defection from General Motors to VW of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
GM's global purchasing director, and several colleagues.
Opel supported its suspicions with affidavits relating to missing secret
data.
Volkswagen claims that no secret information has made its way into the
group's possession, although it admitted earlier this month that 'possible
confidential' material had been destroyed on company property.
Mr Georg Nauth, official spokesman for the investigating team, said
investigations so far had confirmed testimony from Adam Opel, the German
subsidiary of General Motors. This included findings made since an official
statement, made on July 22, linked Mr Lopez and his associates with
confidential data found in a Wiesbaden house.
However, Mr Nauth denied press reports that investigators had established
'without doubt' that the VW trainees had copied Opel secrets into the VW
database.
Mr Nauth refused to name any VW witnesses, although he said Mr Lopez and
three associates under investigation had not been interviewed yet. Mr
Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, had not been called 'because he is not a
suspect', he added.
The 'top-class' witnesses referred to by Mr Seifert are known to include Mr
Daniel Goeudevert, a former VW director, and Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of
the group's board of supervisors, who are also not among the suspects.

Hungarian industry is showing the first signs of recovery after four years

week, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Industrial production grew 5.5 per cent in the year to June, taking activity
back up to the levels of two years ago. There was a 5.3 per cent leap in the
month to June. However, industrial production remains more than 30 per cent
down on the late 1980s and disappointing export statistics clash with the
latest indications of stronger economic activity.

The Ukrainian currency yesterday plunged in value against the dollar,
plummeting to less than one-third of its previous value, writes Oleh Mamaiev

Officials attributed the devaluation at the central bank's hard currency
auction as a reaction to new regulations which oblige Ukrainian exporters to
sell 50 per cent of their hard currency earnings to the government at the
fixed rate of 5,970 coupons to the dollar. Western economists believe the
Ukrainian economy moved into hyper-inflation in June. In yesterday's trading
the Ukrainian coupon fell to 19,050 against the dollar, from last week's
level of 5,970.

THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, yesterday stepped up his campaign
to force parliamentary elections, announcing a two-month strategy to oust
the existing, conservative legislature.
At a press conference held to celebrate the second anniversary of the failed
coup, Mr Yeltsin said parliament was blocking the economic reforms made
possible by the victory of pro-Yeltsin forces in August 1991.
But Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of parliament and one of Mr Yeltsin's
most bitter opponents, vowed that early autumn elections will not take
place. The existing Russian constitution makes no provisions for calling a
poll before the current legislature's mandate expires in 1995.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in German money supply has exceeded the target range set by the
Bundesbank for the fourth consecutive month, writes David Waller in
Frankfurt. According to provisional figures, M3 - which comprises cash in
circulation as well as savings and short-term time deposits - grew at 7.5
per cent in July on an annualised, seasonally adjusted basis.
This follows growth of 7 per cent in June and compares with a target range
of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. Although the headline figure was in line with the
expectations of economists, there was disappointment about a sharp, 8 per
cent rise in bank credits to companies and private individuals over the past
six months.
This is an increase from the 7.6 per cent growth rate in the six months to
July. The August M3 was likely to climb still higher, reflecting Bundesbank
currency interventions.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Rexrodt seeks road to peace for car makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, has had almost three weeks
in which to reconsider his impulsive hint that he might be prepared to act
as middleman in the industrial espionage row between Volkswagen and Adam
Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors.
On Tuesday night he was given food for thought in an hour-long meeting with
Mr David Herman, the beguilingly mild Opel chairman. They had a 'good talk'
on matters of a 'non-communicable nature', according to official statements.
The minister will hear from VW's Mr Ferdinand Piech at a similar private
session today.
Signs of potential misunderstandings were already apparent as this week's
meetings were announced. Mr Rexrodt's office was careful to stress that the
minister's aim was to gather information, while VW tried to suggest the
talks were in some way a continuation of Mr Piech's own peace-making
initiatives.
These started with an abortive attempt to heal the breach with Mr Jack
Smith, GM president, after a nasty exchange at the end of last month.
The VW chairman's suggestions at a press conference, laced with war-like,
xenophobic overtones, that Opel secrets had been 'planted' on his new
employees and in VW computers, had earned him the riposte from GM that his
ideas were grotesque and that his grasp on reason might be less than secure.
A telephone call to Mr Smith was rewarded with the cold shoulder.
Mr Piech might communicate in writing with Mr Herman, but he had to retract
his charges first, he was told. A telephone call from Mr Piech to Mr
Rexrodt, who had appealed for more moderate language and warned against
damaging Germany's international image, was the cue for this week's
interviews.
Both sides, the government, and other German motor makers have reason to be
worried. Although it is understood Washington does not see any immediate
danger to inter-governmental relations, the fact that the US Justice
Department has begun an investigation into the case is reason enough for
concern.
Future US sales prospects for German car makers, not least VW itself, may
also be at stake. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are at or beyond the point of no
return on their first-ever investments in US car plants. Mr Rexrodt is also
confronted by a mood approaching panic in some sectors of the domestic
vehicle components industry, caused partly by VW's draconian price-cutting
demands.
However much the minister may wish for calm, his half-hearted mediation
offer came too late. Mr Rexrodt appears to believe that it is best if both
sides agree to keep quiet and let the criminal investigations proceed.
Volkswagen pre-empted his wishes last weekend when it said it was
withdrawing from the war of words.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Germany tied by its own policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE key to turning round the recession in Germany lies in export markets: on
that, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
Economics Ministry, and the country's main economic institutes are agreed.
They are not sure, however, when the upturn will come, and how strong it
will be.
Moreover, there is a clear relationship between policies intended to tackle
domestic problems and the health of Germany's main export markets. The
Bundesbank's strict monetary stance, designed to stabilise inflation and
maintain D-Mark stability, has been a deciding factor in the stagnation
afflicting other European Community economies. At the same time, the
D-Mark's strength is an important factor militating against a rapid recovery
of German exports.
The latest OECD report sums up neatly the arguments of optimists and
pessimists.
The former, it says, 'expect declining German interest rates will quickly
lead to lower rates elsewhere, and thereby stimulate European activity, and
hence the demand for German exports'. They argue that recent losses of
export market share are due more to the high proportion of investment goods
in German exports than to their price.
Pessimists, on the other hand, fear that expensive German exports will
continue to lose market share in 1994. They blame the rise in wage costs and
D-Mark revaluation.
The OECD errs on the pessimistic side: it forecasts export growth next year
at 2.3 per cent, compared with 3.8 per cent suggested by the economic
institutes, and the Economics Ministry's 4 per cent.
That is against a background of 2.5 and 5 per cent expected growth this year
and next in Germany's main export markets. The OECD suggests that higher
wages and the strong D-Mark this year add 5 per cent to relative unit labour
costs in manufacturing. That should subside to under 1 per cent in 1994.
The report also points to important changes in the composition of Germany's
balance of payments, which led to a huge swing into deficit on the current
account in the aftermath of unification.
Main factors were a surge in imports (largely unification-related) and more
modest growth in exports. The deficit on invisibles widened for four
reasons: soaring tourism payments; a drop in net investment income, as
appreciation of the D-Mark meant large valuation losses on foreign assets;
loss of military receipts with withdrawal of allied troops; and rising
transfers abroad.
The OECD is loath to criticise any German institution too openly, but it
does allow some questions about the adequacy of the Bundesbank's M3 measure
of money supply to creep into its analysis, and therefore some implicit
questioning of the strictness of its interest-rate straitjacket.
It also points out that inflation has been caused by several factors which
do not respond easily to the Bundesbank's lead interest rates: tax-push
effects and administrative price rises in east Germany; service sector
inflation; and structural excess demand in the housing market, forcing up
rents and construction costs.
It urges the central bank to use all its room for manoeuvre to keep cutting
interest rates.
As for the federal government, the criticism is mainly of past policy
failures. The OECD economists say the costs of unification were not seen in
time, and the fiscal adjustment was also far too late.
The solidarity pact negotiated with the federal states last March has gone
some way to stabilising state spending and the rising deficit. But it relies
too much on increasing direct taxation from 1995, too little on cutting
subsidies in the west. The latest DM21bn savings package in the west is much
more like it - concentrating on expenditure, not taxation.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Post Office counters benefit fraud with barcode scanners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Financial Times Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCODE SCANNERS are to be mobilised as a high-tech weapon against benefit
fraud which costs the government an estimated Pounds 300m a year.
The latest anti-fraud campaign, codenamed Alert, is a joint project between
the Post Office and the Department of Social Security's benefit agency. The
scanners will cost Pounds 150m to install nationwide. Initially, however,
they will be tested in 200 London post offices.
Mr Mike Francis, head of the benefit agency's fraud branch, said: 'We hope
most offices will have the equipment by the end of next year, everywhere
except remote places like the Orkneys. You don't get much fraud there.'
The benefit books - mainly pension books in the pilot stages - have been
redesigned to prevent forgery, carrying individual barcodes which can be
read like the price of a loaf of bread at a supermarket checkout.
If a book has been reported stolen, or if a genuine cover has been switched
to conceal stolen coupons of a higher benefit value, the scanner signals an
irregularity to staff, who then confiscate the book.
Eventually the Post Office plans to install 20,000 scanners costing Pounds
7,500 each. The authorities will not disclose details of the scanning
equipment for security reasons. But they would be similar to the Symbol
Technologies machines used by Superdrug, the chemist. 'With a barcode
facility, we can put out a red signal which alerts staff to any
irregularity,' Mr Francis said.
'The new order books are very hard to fake. A trial run showed that
top-of-the-range supermarket equipment will help us save Pounds 5m in the
200 test offices alone. That is not a bad return on a outlay of Pounds 1m to
Pounds 1.5m.'
There are 900m benefit transactions in the UK each year. The scanners could
cut out the need for expensive police operations such as Operation Hammer,
which uncovered counterfeit books in south-east London with a face value of
Pounds 2.4m. Last year, the DSS recovered Pounds 558m in fraudulent benefit
payments, after investigating 270,000 cases.

UNIVERSITY vice-chancellors are calling on the government to introduce a new
funding system requiring students to pay towards their tuition because a
lack of money is denying places to thousands of young people.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals says many 18-year-olds are
missing out 'because the government cannot find the money to fund the extra
places needed to satisfy demand'.
'To achieve a mass higher education system we will need the co-operation of
the government to establish a scheme whereby future graduates can contribute
painlessly to the cost of their education,' it adds.
In a report published today it outlines four possible new methods of raising
funds and will decide on its favoured option next month. The options are:
a 'graduate tax', where graduates would pay a higher rate of income tax for
all of their working lives;
A fee for tuition backed by a loan which would be repaid via higher income
tax payments - graduates on lower incomes would thus take longer repaying;
loans for living costs, at a level chosen by the student, which would
similarly be repaid via the tax system, and;
'top-up fees', again backed by loans repaid via the tax system, which would
allow universities to choose the level of funds they raised.
The Department for Education has welcomed the report, which it says is a
useful contribution to the review of government expenditure being carried
out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury.
However, it denies claims from universities that government funding
decisions lie behind the disappointment for many 18-year-old university
applicants this year.
According to universities, they made more offers of places conditional on
A-level results than they could afford to honour because the government
delayed announcing a cut in funds - from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300 per
student - for classroom-based subjects until December last year.
Yesterday's A-level results, which were better than expected, added to
university admissions tutors' problems, according to the CVCP, because a
higher proportion of candidates than usual successfully completed their
offers.
But Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said there was no evidence that
candidates would miss out. She said those who narrowly missed satisfying
their offers should consider options in further education.
The department says universities should have realised from the autumn
statement that higher education was due for a period of consolidation and
that no rises in funding would be forthcoming.
The vice-chancellors' plans appear to have cautious backing from both
lecturers and students.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Yen's rise reversed after Fed intervenes
</HEADLINE>

MONETARY authorities in the US yesterday dramatically reversed the yen's
powerful rise by intervening in the foreign exchange markets and buying the
dollar. The move surprised currency dealers.
Four interventions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank triggered a surge in
the dollar which earlier this week looked set to fall through the Y100
level. The Fed conducts open market operations for the US central bank.
The interventions pushed up the value of the dollar by 4.6 per cent in four
hours. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at Y105.90, up from its
London close of Y104.15. In early New York trading, it was as low as
Y101.20. The move was substantial, even by recent market standards. In Tokyo
today, the dollar opened at Y104.80.
The Fed's intervention will surprise and gratify the new Japanese
government, which has said for the past week that it would like central
banks from other Group of Seven industrialised countries to help stem the
yen's rise. The Bank of Japan bought dollars again earlier yesterday in the
Tokyo market but until now has felt friendless.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, sworn in as prime minister last week, spoke by
telephone to President Bill Clinton yesterday. Issues discussed included
Japan's continuing high trade surplus with the US, which analysts in Tokyo
thought would militate against any effort by the west to ease the plight of
Japanese exporters. The two countries are to hold bilateral trade talks next
month.
In the US, Mr Lawrence Sum mers, the treasury under-secretary for
international affairs, said the US was 'concerned that the recent rapid rise
in the value of the Japanese yen could retard growth in the Japanese and
world economies'.
Without the intervention, the yen would probably have continued to rise on
news that the US trade deficit had widened to Dollars 12.06bn in June, the
biggest monthly gap since October 1987.
Some analysts suggested that the intervention, the first by the US in three
months, may have been part of an as yet covert deal between the US and
Japanese administrations.
Some Wall Street analysts guessed that the Fed's action was linked to a
cabinet meeting in Tokyo yesterday which pledged to introduce another fiscal
stimulus in the Japanese economy in the autumn. Mr Joe Taylor, a currency
analyst with Technical Data, a market analysis group, said: 'Possibly, the
Japanese gave some sort of assurance to the Clinton administration that the
structural impediments to a healthy trade relationship would be smoothed
out.'
Another interpretation was that, while Washington and Tokyo were still
willing to let the dollar fall against the yen, they were concerned about
the speed of the recent decline. An analyst at one of the largest US
securities houses said: 'I think the intervention is a gesture to the
markets, a signal that everyone should not go too long (on) yen, too
aggressively. It's a dampening move.'
The intervention led investors to sell Japanese government bonds in the
belief that a weaker yen would reduce the chance that the Bank of Japan
would cut the official discount rate.

FT  20 AUG 93 / Barclays appoints banking outsider as chief executive:
Shareholders welcome choice of Courtaulds Textiles head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the largest UK bank, yesterday ended a year of controversy over
its senior management by appointing Mr Martin Taylor, the 41-year-old
chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, as its chief executive.
In one of the most radical corporate appointments in recent years, Barclays
hired Mr Taylor, a former Financial Times journalist, to split the running
of the bank with Mr Andrew Buxton, its executive chairman.
The news was welcomed by shareholders who have criticised Barclays since it
was disclosed in April 1992 that Mr Buxton would combine the roles of
chairman and chief executive. The decision to split the roles was announced
last January.
Criticism of Barclays' management increased earlier this year when the bank
disclosed that it made a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss last year, and cut its
final dividend. It announced first half profits of Pounds 335m this month as
bad debt provisions fell.
One investor described the hiring of Mr Taylor, who has been widely praised
for his restructuring of Courtaulds Textiles, as 'almost too good to be
true'. Barclays shares rose 4 per cent, while those of Courtaulds Textiles
fell 2.6 per cent
Mr Buxton said Mr Taylor would have responsibility for running the bank's
three operating divisions, including its UK branch bank and BZW investment
bank, while he would retain primary responsibility for strategy and external
relations.
However, Mr Buxton emphasised that Mr Taylor would also have a large role in
forming strategy.
'There are bound to be some important strategic decisions over the next few
years, and we will make them together,' he said.
Mr Taylor was appointed chairman of Courtaulds Textiles in March, but was
approached by Barclays' headhunting company in June. He said he had already
intended to become non-executive chairman and seek a job elsewhere within a
year.
Courtaulds Textiles appointed Mr Noel Jervis, the director responsible for
fabrics, as managing director. It said Sir Christopher Hogg, Mr Taylor's
predecessor and currently a non-executive director, would resume the chair
in January.
Mr Taylor, who studied Mandarin at Oxford, is regarded as one of the most
intellectually gifted corporate executives of his generation. Barclays did
not disclose how much it would pay him, although he said it constituted a
'small rise' on the Pounds 206,000 he earned last year. He will be employed
for two years and then on a rolling one-year contract.
Mr Taylor said he intended to stay at Barclays for 10 years. He will join
the board on November 1 and become chief executive on January 1. The largest
immediate challenge would be to improve customer service, he said.
He becomes the youngest chief executive of a British clearing bank, although
Mr Derek Wanless, who was appointed National Westminster Bank's chief
executive last year, is only four years older. Banks have appointed more
executives from other industries in recent years, but Mr Taylor is the first
chief executive of a clearing bank with no banking experience.

FT  19 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Philips executive
sets three-year profit target

THE HEAD of Philips' lossmaking consumer electronics business reaffirmed his
prediction that the sector would reach break-even point this year, but said
that the longer-term goal must be to achieve operating profit equivalent to
between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of net sales.
Mr Henk Bodt, chairman of consumer electronics at the Dutch electronics
group, said he 'would certainly feel very unhappy' if this target were not
attained in three years.
Consumer electronics, Philips' single largest business, posted an operating
loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 77m) in the first half, down from Fl 177m a year
earlier.
The group as a whole saw net profit soar to Fl 1.32bn. This was due largely
to a Fl 1.1bn extraordinary gain on the sale of its stake in a
Japanese-based semiconductor joint venture.
'I am more confident than I was a year ago, and first-half figures gave some
signs of hope,' Mr Bodt said. He stood by previous forecasts that Philips
would go through the break-even point in consumer electronics in the course
of this year, but declined to say whether the sector's full-year result
would be positive or negative.
Mr Bodt, speaking ahead of an important consumer electronics trade show in
Berlin later this month, said the company was stepping up its marketing of
the 'digital compact cassette'.
This is a successor to the standard cassette and a product which will in
part help determine Philips' future in the consumer field. Philips will use
the show to promote a car stereo and a portable version of the DCC.
Mr Bodt said he was 'not completely satisfied' with the initial marketing of
DCC, which was launched in September last year, and added that he wished the
portable and car products had been available earlier.
DCC's rival, the MiniDisc produced by Sony, is so far available only in a
'Walkman' version.
Mr Bodt declined to be drawn on reports that DCC sales were below
expectations.
However, he said he expected car and portable players to account for 60 per
cent of total DCC sales a year from now.
CORRECTION
Philips of the Netherlands expects its consumer electronics business to
break even during 1994, and not this year as wrongly stated yesterday.

PACIFIC Magazines &amp; Printing, an Australian offshoot of News Corporation,
has come through a flat period with profit and dividend growth for the year
ended June.
The company yesterday announced a 13.2 per cent increase in net earnings, to
ADollars 59.2m (USDollars 40m), on a 12.4 per cent sales rise to ADollars
661m. The dividend is going up from 10 cents to 20.4 cents a share.
The result reflected a rise in pre-tax profit from ADollars 52.4m to
ADollars 58.4m for the company's printing division. Pre-tax earnings from
magazines eased from ADollars 46.3m to ADollars 44.9m.
Directors said the results followed a contraction in magazine advertising
and cost increases reflecting increased promotion and improved production
quality.
They said the company had spent ADollars 36m on acquisitions, and a further
ADollars 31m on new plant in the year. This lifted interest-bearing debt by
ADollars 17.3m to ADollars 221.9m.
With much of this expansion concentrated in the Asian region, directors said
they would continue to focus on this area. The result was helped by a
reduction in financing charges, from ADollars 25.1m to ADollars 18.4m. Tax
took ADollars 25.6m, against ADollars 21.3m previously.
The company began trading in its current form in October 1991, and
comparative figures were stated on an annualised basis.
Australian Provincial Newspapers, the regional publishing group 15 per
cent-owned by Independent Newspapers of the UK, has increased net earnings
by 46 per cent to ADollars 6.5m for the June half. Sales rose 7 per cent to
ADollars 67.2m. The interim dividend is up from 1 cent to 2.3 cents a share.
CORRECTION
Australian Provincial Newspapers is 25 per cent-owned by Independent
Newspapers of Ireland, and not 15 per cent by Independent Newspapers of the
UK as wrongly stated yesterday.

world class needs regular investment

<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th August 1993) appended to this article.
Sir, It is encouraging at last to read an article by an economist in your
paper that recognises that manufacturing industry has to expand again
('Painful adjustments', by Bill Robinson, August 17).
However, Mr Robinson believes that businessmen find it difficult to
understand that when oil runs down, the exchange rate weakens, and
manufacturing industry expands again.
Their concern - not lack of understanding - is based simply on the fact
that, once you have destroyed skills, plants and subcontractors, and lost
key research and development facilities and international distribution
networks, it takes years to rebuild them and regain market share against
competitors who may have maintained investment over a decade.
The UK has some of the best companies and products in the world, but on
average there is still a sizeable gap between the us and our best
international competitors (the US and Japan).
Recent endeavours to improve competitiveness have been extremely encouraging
(productivity up 10 per cent over a decade, and 8 per cent in the last
year). However, a solid manufacturing base with its supporting services able
to compete with the best in the world will only happen with sustainable
investment and continuous improvement year after year, and decade after
decade.
That is what the Treasury and economists need to believe and understand, if
we want wealth and employment for the community.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Rise in savings volume at east
German banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL interim savings volume for Ostdeutscher Sparkassen und Giroverband,
eastern Germany's savings banks, rose 5.4 per cent to DM116.3bn (Dollars
69.2bn) compared with the same period last year.
The rise over the first six months of the year, fuelled largely by an
increase in savings among private account holders, coincides with growing
unemployment and fears that any upswing in the economy will take longer than
expected.
A spokesman for the 137 banks grouped under the OSGV, said personal savings
rose by DM3.9bn to DM94.4bn.
He said the high rise in personal savings reflected the end of the 1990-91
consumer boom, as well as uncertainty about future jobs prospects. 'People
are putting aside money for their future security,' he said.
The OSGV also recorded a rise in loans, which grew nearly 12 per cent to
more than DM30bn. About 19 per cent of the total credits were earmarked for
setting up small businesses. This reflects a rise of DM2.2bn to DM14.1bn.
More than 26 per cent of loans went to the services sector; 18 per cent to
small workshops; 14 per cent to trade; and 1 per cent to agriculture.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank to raise DM880m
share capital
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, Germany's third largest bank, is raising DM880m (Dollars 519m)
through an issue of Genussscheine profit-participating certificates which
count as supplementary capital under European Community capital adequacy
rules.
The move, which follows a DM500m rights issue earlier this year and an issue
of Genussscheine last autumn, is designed to boost the bank's capital
position following growth in the balance sheet during the course of the
current year.
It will take the bank's total capital to DM14.5bn, of which DM3.2bn is made
up of profit-participating certificates.
The new certificates will pay 7.25 per cent interest and will be issued at a
price of DM1,100. The certificates, which will be offered to shareholders
between September 1 and September 15, come with warrants attached: each
nominal DM1,000 certificate contains four warrants.
Two warrants offer the right to buy one Commerzbank share at DM300,
exerciseable between January 1994 and December 1997.
Commerzbank said profits in July and August followed the first-half trend
when net operating profits rose 16.3 per cent.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING hopes of a bull market in global equities pushed stock markets in
the UK, Germany, Hong Kong, Spain, Singapore and Malaysia to new peaks
yesterday and produced a strong performance on Wall Street.
Markets in continental Europe continued to respond to expectations of lower
interest rates as UK and German markets strengthened at suggestions that
funds are being pulled out of Japanese equities.
The markets appeared to feed on each others' strength as the day progressed.
As Tuesday's all-time high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average spurred
early price rises in London, so big gains overseas and heavy buying of drug
stocks pushed US equity markets further into record territory yesterday. The
Dow Jones average broke through 3,600 for the first time in yesterday's US
morning trading.
UK equities attracted foreign demand, particularly from the US, as global
investment strategists recommended the London market on hopes of falling
interest rates, a firm currency, and growing confidence in the recovery of
the economy and corporate earnings. Statistics on domestic retail prices and
sales, released yesterday, were in line with expectations.
The FT-SE 100 Index registered its best daily gain since late January,
rising 48.6 points to a new closing peak of 3,073.6. The renewed advance in
share prices was backed up by near record trading in both traded options and
stock index futures.
Stock markets in Pacific Rim countries chalked up five new 1993, or all-time
closing highs. New Zealand equities rose 3.4 per cent to a three-year peak.
Australia shrugged off a tax-laden federal budget to close at its best since
1987.
Hong Kong chalked up its third consecutive peak and Singapore its fourth on
overseas demand for blue chips. Malaysia completed the field as
institutional funds continued to mop up quality stocks.
Germany and Spain also hit new highs for the year. Frankfurt's Dax index hit
1,935.75, up 25.55. Mr Eckhard Frahm, an institutional adviser with Merck
Finck in Dusseldorf, estimated that the 29 per cent appreciation of the yen
this year meant Japanese investors were buying the Dax at an effective level
of under 1,400.

North Korea is ready to resume discussions with the United Nations nuclear
watchdog on opening its atomic sites to inspection, the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Vienna.
Pyongyang stepped back from the brink last month after weeks of tension
following its unprecedented decision in March to withdraw from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, blocking further IAEA checks. But a team of IAEA
experts returned from a week-long visit to North Korea last Thursday and
said they were only allowed to carry out maintenance work on surveillance
equipment at two suspect nuclear plants.

The first US diplomat posted to Hanoi in nearly 40 years arrived yesterday,
but the US went out of its way to play down his role, Reuter reports from
Hanoi.
The temporary assignment of Mr Scott Marciel and two State Department
colleagues to help the US military detachment in Hanoi did not mean the US
was establishing relations with Vietnam, a US government spokesman said.
'This temporary arrangement does not represent any change in US-Vietnamese
relations,' he said in a statement.
The Washington statement said the three diplomats would not rent office
space, fly the American flag or hire local staff. 'What we are doing is to
strengthen our efforts to find the answers for the families of our missing
men,' it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk yesterday said the Inkatha Freedom party and other
important players in South Africa's transition to democracy could approve a
new constitution without returning to the multi-party negotiations, Reuter
reports from Pretoria.
'My point of view is that all major role players must support the final
result and the new constitution,' Mr de Klerk said.
Asked if the process could be concluded without Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's
Zulu-based Inkatha returning to the talks it walked out of last month, Mr de
Klerk said: 'One of the options could be that agreement could be negotiated
in a process which is not necessarily concentrated around specifically one
table.'
Inkatha quit the talks on July 2, when the date of April 27 next year was
set for the country's first all-race election. Chief Buthelezi said this was
premature and criticised how decisions were taken at the talks. He has
refused to send his delegation back to the negotiations but Inkatha has
continued to hold bilateral meetings with the government and African
National Congress.
'The election date can be reached, the formalities are not important,' Mr de
Klerk said. 'In the final analysis a new constitution must have the support
of all role players. We will be looking at all available options to ensure
all agreements have the support of all major parties.'

<TEXT>
SINGAPORE yesterday formally accepted two nominees for the country's first
direct presidential election, but with no rallies or opposition candidates
in sight, the race promises little in the way of spectacle, Reuter reports
from Singapore.
A government commission announced it had accepted the candidacies of Mr Ong
Teng Cheong, who resigned as deputy prime minister to run for president, and
Mr Chua Kim Yeow, a former senior government official.
Mr Tan Soo Phuan and Mr Joshua Jeyaretnam were the only opposition figures
seeking to run. Both were declared ineligible under a law which, in effect,
rules out all but senior members of Singapore's establishment.
'It is anti-democratic,' shouted Mr Tan after police escorted him from the
nomination centre yesterday.
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Sunday only about 400 people were
eligible as candidates under the law.
Political analysts say few Singaporeans doubt that Mr Ong will win the
contest with the support of the ruling People's Action party, which has been
in power since independence in 1965.

THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday said it had admitted the three
central Asian former Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan
as members, bringing its total membership to 56, Reuter reports from Manila.
The three would subscribe to a total of 31,476 shares with a par value of
Dollars 10,000, raising the Manila-based bank's authorised capital stock to
Dollars 24.1bn, the ADB said.
Their membership would become effective once they had completed payment of
their capital subscription and other formalities, the bank said.
The three are already members of the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Their ADB membership is expected to give
them access to more concessional development loans.
Three other former Soviet states - Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan -
last year indicated their interest in joining the ADB.

CONTINUED fighting in Bosnia yesterday threatened to undermine the peace
talks in Geneva despite the agreement between the three warring parties to
hand over control of Sarajevo to the United Nations.
A UN protection force official in Zagreb said fighting was continuing
between Moslem and Croat forces in central Bosnia, in spite of formal
agreements for a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, UN officials in Sarajevo repeated warnings that the estimated
35,000 Moslem inhabitants of Mostar to the south-west, who have been cut off
from humanitarian supplies by fierce fighting between Croat and Serb forces
around the city, are facing critical shortages of food and water.
A Red Cross worker there confirmed that the situation was deteriorating, and
said the city was under sporadic shelling. Although Croat-dominated areas
had some water, there was very little in Moslem areas, where food was also
in shorter supply.
Mr Mate Boban, Bosnia's Croat leader, claims Mostar - mostly Moslem before
the war - as the capital of his ethnic mini-state. UN officials yesterday
dismissed his assertion that relief workers had been allowed into the city.
In an attempt to shore up the talks, international mediators summoned Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, and his Croat counterpart, Mr Franjo
Tudjman, to Geneva. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the conference
co-chairmen, appear to believe that the Serb and Croat presidents, due to
arrive today, will exert pressure on their respective proteges.
Meanwhile, as the diplomatic tensions between the UN and Nato over the
possible use of air strikes continued to bubble, the Belgian government
yesterday announced that it fully supported Lieutenant-General Francis
Briquemont, the Belgian UN commander in Sarajevo, in spite of his
controversial comments attacking Washington's threatened air strikes.
Gen Briquemont, and Brigadier Vere Hayes, his British chief of staff, had
been quoted earlier this week as criticising the Nato plans for air strikes.
Their comment prompted an angry response from the US envoy to the UN, Ms
Madeleine Albright, who said it was 'unconscionable' for two senior UN
officers in Bosnia to have questioned President Bill Clinton's policy.
Nato officials in Brussels yesterday sought to play down the comments,
insisting that their threat of air strikes remained very real. Nevertheless,
there were indications in London that Gen Briquemont's fears about the
implications of air strikes were shared by many other European allies.
The threat of air strikes has receded in recent days with the withdrawal of
Serb forces from strategic heights around Sarajevo.
Commander Barry Frewer, spokesman for the UN protection force in Sarajevo,
said small numbers of Serb soldiers were still in the woods on Mount Igman
despite an agreement to leave last Saturday, but said they posed no threat.
The UN and leaders of the Bosnian Serbs have already announced the complete
withdrawal of Serb forces from Mount Igman.
Commander Frewer declined to say how many Serbs remained on the mountain
which commands the western approaches to the city, but a Bosnian army
spokesman claimed that at least 250 remained, with more hidden in the woods.

FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sun Alliance slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The composite insurance area of the market was rife with rumours of an
imminent rights issue, with marketmakers plumping for a big issue from Sun
Alliance and moving the share price lower as the session progressed.
At the close, Sun Alliance was a shade easier at 396p after relatively good
turnover of 3.2m shares. The rest of the composite sector was also under a
cloud as the cash-call stories circulated.
The rights issue talk was embellished with precise details of the terms of
the issue - said to be a one-for-six at 345p to raise around Pounds 500m.
Most analysts disregarded the suggestions, saying that Sun Alliance has one
of the highest solvency ratios among the UK composites and that its balance
sheet had been boosted, along with other insurance groups, by the upsurge in
UK equities and gilts in the past few months.
Sun Alliance is scheduled to report interim results early next month, with
brokers forecasting that the group will achieve profits in the region of
Pounds 50m, compared with a loss of almost Pounds 98m in the same period
last year.
Guardian Royal Exchange, 2 off at 208p, was also mentioned as likely to ask
shareholders for cash. GRE's interim figures are due for release on August
26, with the company forecast to report profits of around Pounds 60m,
against a Pounds 39m loss.
Sedgwick 'old' stood at 194p ex-rights with the new shares finally quoted at
23p after Transamerica, the US insurance group, was thought to have sold its
nil-paid rights into the market. A block of just over 23m new nil-paid
shares was sold to one marketmaker at 17p and placed in the market at 18p.
Britannic Assurance was in good form, ending 10 ahead at 442p, after the
increased interim dividend.
The banks sector was one of the few areas of the market to encounter heavy
investor resistance to the upsurge in share prices. 'There is an increasing
feeling that the sector has already run ahead of itself and is due for a
correction,' said one banks specialist.
HSBC, one of the star performers in the financials area over the past year,
ran into a flurry of profit-taking, closing 8 down at 764p on turnover of
4.9m. Barclays also attracted persistent selling, settling 5 cheaper at 472p
on 7.5m traded.
Standard Chartered continued to defy intermittent bouts of selling pressure,
responding instead to forecasts of outstanding earnings per share growth in
the current year and closing 6 higher at 989p, after touching a record 994p
at one point.
Merchant banks, the best performing sector of the stock market since the UK
withdrew from the ERM last September, resumed their upward path, led by SG
Warburg, 20 higher at 804p, and Kleinwort Benson, 6 up at 499p.
British Gas continued to attract large-scale buying interest after the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the gas industry, which is
increasingly being viewed by the big institutions as as good an outcome as
the market could have hoped for. British Gas advanced 8 more to 335 1/2 p
with turnover a hefty 19m shares.
Enterprise Oil, a poor market since last week's resignation of Mr John
Walmsley, the highly rated finance director, came under renewed selling
pressure and fell 7 to 432p, with the big institutions said to have been
switching out of the stock and into companies such as British Gas, BP and
Shell Transport.
Pittencrief jumped 20 to 291p in response to the sharp rise in the price of
its US associate, Pittencrief Communications.
Shares in British Aerospace were back in favour after the company said it
was raising the size of its refinancing package (a five-year underwritten
revolving credit facility) that was agreed last month by Pounds 100m to
Pounds 1.5bn, after it won widespread support among its banks. The shares
rose 13 to 468p. Fears about the financing of its regional jets joint
venture with Taiwan had led to weakness in the stock in the previous
session.
A buy recommendation from Smith New Court boosted Lucas Industries, which
gained 6 at 162p. Smith believes: 'Under the existing management, the
company is likely to maintain the final dividend.' Motor dealer Evans
Halshaw put on a further 16 at 390p as the market continued to appreciate
Tuesday's bumper profits.
A profits downgrade for First Leisure, said to be by Cazenove, left the
shares 15 down at 319p.
Stores shares performed strongly as belief in a consumer recovery
underpinned by more domestic interest rate cuts attracted investors. Among
the leaders, Boots surged 15 1/2 to 490 1/2 p, GUS 'A' 38 to 2058p, Next 6
to 208p and WH Smith 'A' 10 to 479p.

FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that Rank Organisation will suffer if more British holidaymakers go
abroad next year prompted two brokers to turn sellers of the stock. Both
tour operator Thomson and Thomas Cook, the travel agent, forecast a 10 per
cent growth in the package holiday market for 1994 as they launched their
new brochures this week.
NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett were both pointing out that Rank's
domestic holiday business, encompassing the Butlin's and Haven-Warner
chains, could be hit as a result. While NatWest was advising investors to
take profits - the shares having performed strongly in the last quarter -
Hoare was recommending a switch into Thorn EMI. Rank lost 7 to 792p.
Mr Hamish Dickson, leisure analyst at Hoare, said that in contrast Thorn's
recent underperformance had been overdone and that the stock also held yield
attractions. He added that recent music industry figures showed the
potential recovery in the European market and that Thorn was ideally placed
to exploit it.
Thorn shares had been badly hit two weeks ago by the group's decision to
redeem a preference issue early, which could have left around 11m shares in
the group overhanging the market. Hoare claims that its latest research
suggests it is now unlikely to be higher than 7m. Thorn shares climbed 15 to
952p.

FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs up on US demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG STOCKS led the market higher for a second day as American investor
enthusiasm showed no sign of abating. Yesterday, Wellcome was the star
performer, the shares surging 55 to 733p in hefty turnover of 8m, its
highest daily volume in six months.
Zeneca, the former bioscience arm of ICI, was also in sparkling form,
appreciating 32 to 695p. Turnover there was a heavy 9.5m. Glaxo, which had
led the surge on Tuesday with a 36 1/2 p rise, climbed a further 33 to 591p
yesterday with even higher volume of 12m shares. SmithKline Beecham also
showed a sharp gain, finishing 18 1/2 stronger at 466 1/2 p.
US investors were still responding positively to the speech made on Monday
by President Clinton in which he failed to mention drug price cuts - an
issue casting a cloud over the sector in recent months - as part of his
healthcare reforms. The president's omission was taken as a signal by some
on Wall Street that pharmaceuticals will escape any punitive financial
regulation when the White House plans are announced later this year.
Analysts were also continuing to point out yesterday the relative
underperformance of the leading drugs shares, and that even after
yesterday's gains they still looked good value. Mr John Aldersley at Smith
New Court said: 'No-one likes to see stocks move this fast, but even after
today's rise, they are still down on six months ago.' He remains a buyer of
Wellcome and SmithKline, although less positive on Glaxo.

FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG overseas demand drove the derivatives sector sharply ahead, sending
the September Footsie futures contract to a new peak, and brought healthy
turnover in the traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, a firm start to trading in the September contract on the FT-SE
100 at 3,042 was followed by strong demand, in anticipation of favourable
data on inflation. Confirmation of good inflation figures, together with
good demand from US buyers, drove the contract further ahead, with UK
institutions said to have been largely absent from the day's main action.
This developed into a squeeze, in which the futures led the cash market
higher.
It finished at 3,086, up 55 from the previous close and around 4 points
above the estimated fair value premium to cash of about 7 points. A premium
of between 10 and 15 points was seen for most of the session. By the close a
hefty 17,086 contracts had been traded, the daily average for this year
being 11,313 lots.
Active dealing in the index options, ahead of Friday's expiry, made a
significant contribution to strong volume in the traded options. Total
turnover reached 73,642, of which 29,434 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option
and 8,796 in the Euro FT-SE option. The combined average volume for the two
options this year stands at 10,985 lots. British Steel was the busiest stock
option.

FT  19 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: New Footsie peak on overseas buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUDDEN rush of overseas buying caught the UK stock market by surprise
yesterday and drove share prices to new all-time peaks. Marketmakers
struggled with a shortage of stock now of severe proportions, while record
trading in both traded options and the September Footsie future indicated
the rush by fund managers to climb aboard the rising stock market.
Equity prices opened higher and, in spite of a weaker government bond
market, moved ahead strongly throughout the session. At best, the FT-SE 100
Index touched a new trading peak of 3,076.2, before settling to a closing
high of 3,073.6; the day's gain of 48.6 was the largest daily rise since
January 26 this year. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed 29 points to a new
peak of 3,494.9.
'There was substantial overseas investment in UK equities yesterday,' said
Mr Nigel Little of Panmure Gordon. Dealers reported heavy US demand for UK
equities, and the attractions of the UK market were supported by a global
strategy note from Nomura International, which was believed to have operated
a buy programme in UK equities.
'Don't be long Japan . . . don't be short Hong Kong, UK, US and Mexico,' was
the advice to clients from Mr Nicholas Knight,the Nomura strategist who
remains committed to his forecast of a Footsie reading of 3,500 at end-1993.
Mr Knight sees London as attractive for foreign investors because of its
perceived recovery in the economy and in corporate earnings, as well as
falling interest rates and a firm currency.
The announcement yesterday of a rise of only 1.4 per cent in UK retail
prices and a decline of 0.2 per cent in retail sales in July left views on
the economy little changed, but the firmness of sterling underlined optimism
on interest rates. However, UK equities lacked encouragement from the
domestic government bonds, which yesterday saw a reversal of the firmer tone
of recent sessions.
Further strong rises in the drugs stocks as US investors regained confidence
in the sector provided a sound platform for the advance in the Footsie
index. But domestic retail shares responded to the market's confidence that
interest rates will fall again soon by moving ahead in good volume.
Favourable views of the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruling on
British Gas overflowed to benefit other utility issues.
Seaq volume increased sharply to 887.1m shares, close behind the year's
record of 908.2m registered less than a week ago. Tuesday's Seaq turnover of
638.5m shares, when the Footsie gained 16.7, was worth Pounds 1.43bn in
retail value, confirming that investors continued to take the bull tack.
Domestic confidence in the UK equity market has been reinvigorated by this
week's news that Britain's public sector deficit was below expectations last
month, buttressing hopes that the UK government is under less pressure to
raise taxes in its November Budget.
Equity traders were prepared to brush off the slower trend in UK government
bonds yesterday, dismissing this as little more than expected profit-taking.
A rising bond market has provided the background for the advance in UK
equities which, NatWest Securities has commented, are no more expensive
relatively than they were several weeks ago.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Drug shares help push Dow to
another record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SHARP RISES on overseas markets and heavy buying of drug shares pushed US
equity markets further into record territory yesterday, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average finishing above 3,600 for the first time, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow, which ended at an all-time high on Tuesday, was up a
further 17.88 at 3,604.86, but some way below its peak for the day of
3,617.71.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 2.91 to 456.04, but it
remained just shy of its record close of 456.33. The American SE composite
added 3.97 at 446.63 and the Nasdaq composite was up 3.82 at 734.83, both
record peaks. Trading volume on the New York SE was heavy at 312.9m shares.
Stronger overseas markets set the tone for an upbeat opening to US trading.
Markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris staged big rallies before New York
started trading, and analysts were not surprised when US equities picked up
where European stocks had left off.
The US markets were also aided by further gains in Treasury prices. The
benchmark 30-year government issue yesterday rose almost three-quarters of a
point, lowering the yield to 6.255 per cent, the lowest it has been since
the Treasury began selling 30-year bonds in 1977.
Falling yields are bullish for stocks because they lower the cost of capital
for US companies, and because they make equities look a more attractive
alternative to investors seeking high yields.
Pharmaceutical issues were in the vanguard of the markets' rise. Analysts
said the sector is now looking oversold, and luring investors looking for
bargain buys.
Merck rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 , Pfizer Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars
63 1/4 , Bristol Myers-Squibb Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 ,
Schering-Plough Dollars 2 to Dollars 63, Glaxo Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 17
7/8 and John-son &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40, all on heavy buying.
Eastman Kodak firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 in volume of 3.1m shares
after the company, which recently announced changes among its senior
management, unveiled plans to cut 10,000 jobs and boost its cash flow to
Dollars 2.8bn by the end of 1995.
Consumer products shares were in demand. Procter &amp; Gamble gained Dollars 1
7/8 at Dollars 49 1/8 , Philip Morris Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 1/8 , RJR
Nabisco Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 5 1/4 and American Brands Dollars 1 at
Dollars 32 5/8 .
Airline issues moved against the broader trend, weakening on concern about
the earnings outlook for the sector. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 , UAL Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 144 1/2 ,
Delta Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 3/8 and USAir Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15
7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks were mixed, with Borland
International up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 17 3/4 and Intel Dollars  1/2
higher at Dollars 65 1/2 but Microsoft unchanged at Dollars 77 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed solidly higher in heavy trading as the market
shrugged off worries about a weak Canadian dollar.
The TSE 300 index rose 36.8 to 4,069.3 and advancing issues outnumbered
declines by 471 to 273. Volume was 74.9m shares.
Some observers are concerned about the lower Canadian dollar pushing up
short-term interest rates, threatening to further stifle an already weak
economic recovery. However, a lower exchange rate compared with the US
currency is seen as beneficial to the large number of Canadian companies
with exports to the US or whose products are priced in US dollars.

SAO PAULO resumed forward progress after an earlier suspension of trading in
Telebras by Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission was lifted. But the
market faltered later, the Bovespa index losing 0.8 per cent on the day,
after Tuesday's 3.8 per cent rise.
The suspension of Telebras, which accounts for some 60 per cent of the
market's daily average volume, was requested by the authorities to clarify
comments in the media by the group's president which referred to the launch
of a new ADR later this year.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Madrid scale new
peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses saw new highs in Frankfurt and Madrid, and some near misses,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT raised its sights to include the April 2, 1990 DAX all time high
of 1,976.43 as the DAX index rose 25.55 to a new 1993 peak of 1,935.86. But
it widened them, too, to incorporate potential short-term volatility as DTB
options expire tomorrow.
Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM10.4bn. Ms Heidemarie Hoppner, at B Metzler
in Frankfurt, wondered whether Volkswagen would be able to hold a DM400
striking price on Friday, or Bayer DM300, or BASF DM260. Yesterday, these
three rose DM4.80 to DM400, DM3 to DM302, and DM2.90 to DM260.60
respectively.
Options-related buying was credited, too, for the DM23 rise to DM744 in
Daimler, recommended by DB Research along with Siemens, up DM5.60 yesterday
to DM690.50, and Allianz, which justified its beta stock rating with a gain
of DM57 to DM2,475.
Meanwhile, the trading sell of Schering from the same source, on a reworking
of the sums for its Betaseron multiple sclerosis drug, seemed to have run
its course for the time being as the stock recovered DM26.50 to DM961.
MADRID extended a climb founded on interest rate hopes, the general index
closing another 3.60 higher at a new 1993 high of 290.46. Dealers said that
Wall Street quoted stocks, Telefonica, Repsol, Endesa, Iberdrola and a few
of the big banks, had led prices upwards.
Telefonica rose Pta55 to Pta1,560, and Repsol by Pta50 to Pta3,715, as
turnover climbed again from Pta26.7bn to Pta31.55bn.
PARIS, encouraged by the continued strength of the franc, added another
24.46 or 1.1 per cent to the CAC-40 index which closed at 2,160.75.
Turnover was strong at FFr4.1bn. Brokers at the Paris office of James Capel
said that interest had shifted to recent market laggards, such as Alcatel
Alsthom, up FFr20 at FFr725 and Rhone-Poulenc, FFr6.10 higher at FFr166.
Interest has also been strong in Alcatel ahead of an announcement from South
Korea, due this week, on the award of a railway contract. Siemens of Germany
is another leading contender for this contract.
Rhone-Poulenc has recently attracted a buy recommendation from Kleinwort
Benson, which forecast a rise in the shares, helped by an upturn in the
chemical sector next year.
AMSTERDAM switched its attention from the publishing sector, strong on
Tuesday, to foods. The CBS Tendency index gained 2.1 or 1.6 per cent to
128.8.
An analyst at the Amsterdam brokers, Pierson, commented that it was evident
that institutions were being sector specific at present, concentrating on
those which had underperformed the market in recent weeks. The present
rally, he added, was sentiment driven on expectations of lower European
interest rates following the next Buba council meeting later this month.
Among active stocks, Unilever gained Fl 3.50 to Fl 199.20, Heineken Fl 4.70
to Fl 180.50 and Bols Wessanen Fl 1.80 to Fl 41.80.
The positive mood was enough to underpin Nedlloyd, the shipping and
transport group, which reported a worse than expected half year loss of Fl
116m, and the shares closed down just 50 cents at Fl 45.50, although off an
intraday year's high of Fl 48.50 just before the announcement.
Hunter Douglas, the building components company which pleased the market
with Tuesday's six month figures, put on Fl 9.50 or 16 per cent to Fl 68.70.
ZURICH ended almost 1 per cent higher, the SMI index rising 22.4 to 2,487.2.
There was good demand for selected industrials and banks, the latter after
results from Credit Suisse which left bearers in its parent, CS Holding,
SFr85 higher at SFr2,910.
Among industrials, Nestle added SFr11 to SFr1,104 and Brown Boveri SFr20 to
SFr949, the latter in advance of today's half-year results.
STOCKHOLM featured strength in banks and a rise in Electrolux B of SKr12 to
SKr273 on good half year results. The Affarsvarlden general index advanced
37.2 to 1,339.1 in heavy turnover of SKr2.9bn. OSLO's All-share index was up
5.91 to 586.37 in turnover of NKr918m, assisted by a gain in Hafslund of
NKr4.50 to NKr135.00; and, in HELSINKI, the HEX index put on 2.9 per cent to
1,489.6.
MILAN remained in strong form, although some sporadic profit-taking was
evident towards the close. The Comit index ended up 10.73 or 1.8 per cent at
618.98.
Generali built on Tuesday's 4.7 per cent rise, adding another L647 to
L41,703.
The telecommunications sector also came under the spotlight with respective
gains in Stet and Sip of L38 and L75 to L4,400 and L3,527.
DUBLIN barely scraped to a new 1993 high although, on the day, the ISEQ
overall index rose 28.04, or 1.6 per cent to 1,745.86 with financials 2.2
per cent ahead.

EQUITY prices fluctuated as investors waited for a statement by Mr Yasushi
Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, and the Nikkei average closed
moderately lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally down 68.80 at 20,773.18 after moving
between a range of 20,732 and 20,964. Share prices were also supported by
arbitrage buying, but met heavy profit-taking later by investors who had
purchased stocks around the 21,000 level.
Volume contracted to 280m shares from 320m. Declines led rises by 595 to
362, with 197 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
shed 5.89 to 1,675.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 1.58 at
1,276.65.
After the market had closed, Mr Mieno denied that there were plans for a
discount rate cut, adding that the mechanism for a recovery was in place.
Meanwhile, the yen took a breather from its record-breaking rise, trading
narrowly between Y101.32 and Y101.70.
Profit-taking continued to depress steels and shipbuilders, with financial
institutions selling stock. Nippon Steel dipped Y10 to Y380 and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries receded Y13 to Y687.
Cosmo Securities, which will become a subsidiary of Daiwa Bank, closed at an
offered price of Y549, down by its daily limit from Friday's close of Y649.
The stock was suspended from trading on Monday and Tuesday after the company
had announced losses of Y68.9bn due to irregular shifting of clients'
accounts. The broker said that it will allocate 243.75m new shares to Daiwa
at Y320 per share.
However, other brokers firmed on bargain hunting, with Nikko Securities
improving Y20 to Y1,370 and Daiwa Securities Y40 to Y1,480.
High-technology issues were mixed: Toshiba fell Y13 to Y677 and Sony lost
Y10 to Y4,340 but Matsushita Electric Industrial advanced Y10 to Y1,370.
Housing shares were higher on hopes raised by the new government's measures
to boost housing starts. Daikyo rose Y10 to Y1,330.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 45.12 easier at 22,673.37 in volume of 60m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, retreated Y300 to Y9,250 as
investors took profits.
Roundup
CLOSING highs were almost the order of the day around the Pacific Rim.
NEW ZEALAND was catapulted to its best close in more than 3 1/2 years by a
turnround from loss into profits at Fletcher Challenge, the forestry
company.
Fletcher shot up 47 cents, or nearly 16 per cent, to NZDollars 3.47, helping
the NZSE-40 index to close 63.80, or 3.4 per cent, stronger at 1,957.24.
Brokers estimated turnover in excess of NZDollars 90m, its highest since the
1987 crash, with half of that volume in Fletcher shares.
AUSTRALIA closed at its highest level since 1987, shrugging off a tax-laden
federal budget to end 20 ahead at 1,894.7. Brokers said low inflation and
perceptions that the economy was on the mend also stoked the rise.
HONG KONG chalked up its third straight record high on overseas buying of
blue chips, the Hang Seng index adding 32.18 at 7,560.97. Turnover fell from
HKDollars 5.69bn to HKDollars 4.63bn.
Investors were also optimistic about corporate results due from Hang Seng
Bank, Hutchison and Cheung Kong today, although each of these underperformed
on the day with falls of 50 cents to HKDollars 61.50, and 10 cents apiece to
HKDollars 22.90 and HKDollars 27.80 respectively.
SINGAPORE's fourth consecutive peak left the Straits Times Industrial index
up a further 23.06, or 1.2 per cent, at 1,951.40. KUALA LUMPUR hit a new
high with the KLSE composite index gaining 6.11 at 791.02 as institutional
funds continued to mop up quality stocks led by Tanjong and Telekom
Malaysia, which firmed 40 and 20 cents to MDollars 15.10 and MDollars 15.90.
SEOUL's recovery from the false names trading ban continued on bargain
hunting, optimism that the government will come up with market-boosting
measures, and an inflow of funds. The composite index rose 24.24 to 713.18.
BOMBAY advanced in spite of higher margins on sales and purchases imposed by
the stock exchange authorities to keep a check on continuously rising
prices. The BSE-30 index put on 55.81 at 2,631.39.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Central America feels the benefits of
liberalisation - The region's equity markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new climate of economic liberalisation and growing political stability has
given a boost recently to Central America's fledgling stock markets. But
business caution, and sometimes arduous legal procedures, mean that they
still have a long way to go.
Many of the leading companies in Central America - a geographical area
bounded by Guatemala and Panama - are family owned and, faced with the
prospect of being accountable to shareholders, have been reluctant to issue
shares. Share issues and commercial paper also require financial disclosure
which, in a region notorious for its failure to pay taxes, has put off a
number of potential participants.
But Mr Roberto Solorzano of Guatemala's Bolsa de Valores Nacional, the
largest and oldest of the country's three exchanges, believes that this will
have to change. In the past, the protection afforded to Central American
businesses by high external tariff barriers meant that they enjoyed largely
captive markets in which foreign competition was limited. But following
rapid economic liberalisation, this is no longer the case.
'If Guatemalan companies are to survive they will have to increase capital
in order to compete,' says Mr Solorzano.
A capital market has yet to appear in Guatemala, but four large local
companies are preparing to issue shares by the end of the year, and a dollar
futures market is developing, according to Mr Solorzano.
Investors had hoped that the market, which is currently trading about 1.2bn
quetzales a month (Dollars 210m), would reap the benefits of a prospective
share issue representing the government's remaining 25 per cent stake in
Aviateca, the former national airline.
But since the election of Mr Ramiro de Leon as Guatemalan president in June,
the previous government's extensive privatisation programme has been put on
hold for fear of antagonising the labour unions.
The oldest and largest market in Central America is in Costa Rica, where the
Bolsa Nacional de Valores began operating in 1976. Over 90 per cent of
transactions on both primary and secondary markets are government bond
issues.
Of the 115 companies listed, only 12 have issued shares, the rest covering
mostly short-term commercial paper. The bolsa is now having to compete with
a second exchange after the opening of the Bolsa Electronica, which uses
software of the Chilean exchange which, it hopes, will provide it with a
technological advantage.
Meanwhile, in northern Central America, plans are also under way to
strengthen the links between the markets of Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala, as economic integration between the 'northern triangle' has
gathered pace.
At a meeting earlier this year, these three countries' presidents agreed to
facilitate a closer integration of the markets as part of moves towards
greater financial harmonisation, to include free movement of capital, and
permission for national banks to operate in neighbouring countries.
A committee of members of the three exchanges is looking at the practicality
of trading on each other's markets without having to make major changes to
current legislation. There is already an agreement to allow brokers to work
in all three countries and to allow securities registered in one country to
be traded in the others.
'It is a question of time; there are no major obstacles,' says Mr Guillermo
Hidalgo-Quehl, president of the El Salvadorean exchange. 'What we need to do
is to put these agreements into practice.'
But Mr Roberto Orellana, the president of the El Salvadorean Central Bank,
admits that it will not be so easy. 'One of the problems is currency
convertibility,' he says.
In Guatemala, all foreign exchange must be sold daily to the Central Bank,
which complicates payments. In addition, a future electronic link-up is at
the mercy of particularly poor telecommunications in El Salvador and
Guatemala.
Mr Orellana is confident, however, that the system will be operating fluidly
this year. 'The laws are becoming more uniform,' he says. 'The markets
should integrate, and become more competitive.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Portillo dips futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling interest rate futures fell back sharply yesterday after
a British government minister sugg-ested that there might not be any
interest rate cuts in the UK for some time, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's July data for retail sales and inflation were much as the market
had expected and had little effect on sterling prices.
But interest rate futures fell back and the longer dated cash rates firmed
after Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, was satisfied with current interest
rates.
'He is showing himself satisfied with the present level of interest rates,'
Mr Portillo told a television interviewer. 'So I do not want to lead you to
expect any changes whatsoever.'
The comments had an immediate impact on futures dealers who, in recent
weeks, have pushed the December contract up to levels that virtually price
in a full percentage point off interest rates.
The contract dropped 14 basis points at one stage to a day's low of 94.58,
before ending at 94.62. The September contract was 8 basis points down on
the day at 94.16.
In the cash market, three-month money was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent. The
yield curve out to six months and one year sloped a little less steeply than
it did on Tuesday, however. Six-month money closed at 5 per cent and the
one-year rate at 5 17/32 per cent.
The overnight cost of lending was up at 6.50 per cent because of
difficulties removing a Pounds 900m shortage, which left late assistance of
Pounds 285m.
French franc market interest rates fell sharply yesterday as the currency
continued to appreciate on the foreign exchanges.
Three-month French francs were back below 8 per cent yesterday, closing at
7.75 per cent from a previous 8.33 per cent. September French franc interest
rates were up 26 basis points on the day, finishing at 93.08 from a previous
close of 92.82.
In its weekly intervention in currency markets, the Bundes-bank drained
liquidity of DM5.8bn. This was due to a lack of interest in the weekly
tender, which again came at a fixed rate of 6.80 per cent. With call money
yesterday at 6.74 per cent, dealers clearly borrowed more cheaply in the
interbank market.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling up on rate comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING rose sharply against both the D-Mark and the dollar in London
yesterday afternoon, after a UK government minister gave a strong indication
that interest rate cuts should not be expected for the time being, writes
James Blitz.
After falling below the DM2.49 level at the start of the week, the pound
stabilised on Tuesday as dealers took the view that a cut in interest rates
had already been priced into the market.
However, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the UK Treasury, told
British television yesterday that an easing in monetary policy was not to be
anticipated. This led to a sharp fall in UK interest rate futures and
sterling climbed 2 1/4 pfennigs to close at DM2.5450. A London dealer spoke
of a very large commercial order being received from the Far East.
The pound was not affected by July's figures for retail sales and inflation,
both of which were released yesterday. However, sterling may have gained
some momentum from a sharp rise in UK equity markets. US investors may have
sought to profit from the rise in UK shares, and the pound gained 2 1/2
cents against the dollar to close at Dollars 1.5125.
Sterling's rise may partly have triggered a fall in the dollar/D-Mark rate,
as dealers commenced selling of the US currency yesterday afternoon. The
Bundesbank's latest monthly report also supported the D-Mark, giving little
indication of any prospect of German short-term rates coming down. The
central bank said high money growth meant the scope for cuts was limited.
The dollar ended at DM1.6825, down about 1 1/2 pfennigs. It finished New
York trading at DM1.6800.
By contrast, the dollar/yen exchange rate was confined to tight ranges as
dealers waited for today's Japanese cabinet meeting, which could bring a
response to the high yen. Mr Yasushi Mieno, Japan's central bank governor,
said yesterday that the authorities were not considering a cut in the
discount rate, although some thought the possibility still existed. The
dollar closed steady in London at Y101.50, and at Y101.65 in New York.
In Europe, the French franc continued to perform strongly in the wake of
Tuesday's easing in French money market rates. The currency closed at
FFr3.514 per D-Mark from a previous FFr3.517.
There was market talk that the Bank of France was buying foreign currencies
as the franc appreciated, needing to make up for the severe depletion of its
reserves in the midst of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. One
dealer also spoke of rumours that Belgium and Luxembourg were at odds over
whether to continue their common currency area.
The Danish krone recovered from an early fall against the D-Mark after
Denmark's central bank said it was selling D-Marks to support its currency.
The krone was trading at DKr4.0936, having been at DKr4.1200 earlier in the
day.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tradition takes a back seat in
mozzarella market - A victory for cows over buffaloes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE ROELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOZZARELLA cheese business has become one of the fastest growing
agricultural foodstuff sectors in Italy. Production has increased threefold
in the past five years and now sales are generating an annual turnover of
about Ll,950bn (Pounds 820m).
The growing popularity of mozzarella inside Italy and abroad has placed the
bulk of new demand on fior di latte - the cheaper and more industrially
produced cows' milk version.
Only about 10 per cent of the market is held by what Italians consider the
real mozzarella, made from buffalo milk. This differs from the cows' milk
product in its more pronounced flavour and softer, fattier texture, as well
as its porcelain white colour. Such special characteristics do not come
cheap. Mozzarella made from buffalo milk costs roughly twice as much as
ordinary mozzarella: usually L20,000 to L23,000 a kilogram, compared with
L12,000 or less for the best cows' milk cheese.
Only as a result of intense lobbying was the cows' milk product allowed to
call itself mozzarella in 1987. Buffalo milk producers bitterly resent this
broadening of the product name and have been fighting a rear-guard action
ever since.
With more than 90 per cent of buffalo-milk mozzarella produced in southern
Italy, mostly on small-holdings, it is perhaps not surprising that the
lobbying of the bigger and better organised northern dairy farmers won their
case. Within the industry, it is also said that the growing mozzarella
business was one element encouraging farmers to over-produce on Italy's
European Community milk quota.
The limited amount of buffalo mozzarella produced each year will probably
prevent it ever proving a serious threat to fior di latte's dominance. This
is partly the result of natural factors: buffalo give most milk in winter,
when mozzarella is not much eaten, and much less in summer when fresh
cheeses are popular. This has led to a great deal of fraud, with cow's milk
being substituted in summer in order to satisfy demand.
Buffalo farms are generally small - only about 100 have more than 200
animals - and as 75 per cent of buffalo mozzarella is made in the farm, the
small scale of operations makes mechanisation expensive. Larger dairies have
mechanised the entire process of cheese-making, as well as packaging, but if
many small dairies have a machine for moulding the cheese, they carry out
most other operations manually.
The fragmentation of production of the buffalo milk cheese inhibits a
national network of distribution - in any case complicated because of the
need for the product to be sold fresh. Between 30 and 35 per cent of buffalo
mozzarella is sold directly to consumers at the dairy. Only 10 per cent
reaches the north of Italy.
Mozzarella using cow's milk has been much more successful in establishing
mass production, and 90 per cent of the market is held by four large
companies: Galbani, Invernizzi, Locatelli and Kraft. Its production is
almost entirely mechanised, while distribution is so efficient that a
consumer survey by Largo Consumo found the cheese present even in small
supermarkets 100 per cent of the time.
Nevertheless, according to Mr Alfredo Jemma, a big independent buffalo
producer near Naples, 'buffalo mozzarella may take only a small slice of the
market, but she is queen'. When the buffalo product is present, consumers
are apt to pick it instead of ordinary mozzarella. Its craftsman-like
quality is attractive to the modern consumer, keen to indulge in and
prepared to pay substantially for the riches of what the Italian Ministry of
Agriculture calls 'a society immersed in alimentary well-being'. Even the
large buffalo dairies, which use machines, continue to make a certain
quantity of cheese by hand to cater for this demand. Mr. Jemma explains: 'It
is an unbeatable method as far as quality is concerned'.
As a result, even without the help of government or EC subsidies, small
businesses have been able to survive through the popularity of the quality,
high-value food they produce. Scale of operation is not so important. 'You
can make a good living with a dairy, even with 200 kg (per day),' comments
Mr. Michele D'Amato, who sells mozzarella in the town of Eboli, just south
of Naples.
The government has recognised the special qualities of buffalo mozzarella,
even if it gave way on the trade denomination of mozzarella to include fior
di latte. Negotiations are under way for the cheese to go a step further
from its current status as a 'typical' product and become a 'DOC'
(controlled origin) one. More important from the standpoint of the Italian
dairy industry's fortunes within the EC, buffalo mozzarella will probably
qualify as a DOC cheese.
Italy imports L1,665bn worth of cheese, but exports only L521bn worth
because local production costs are so high. This also applies to fior di
latte. At present, in fact, Luxembourg exports more mozzarella per head of
population than Italy.
Buffalo mozzarella on the other hand falls within the bracket that
constitutes the country's strength in the export field: typical, quality
cheeses difficult to imitate abroad. The passage of mozzarella into EC
consciousness will not be without problems, however. Popularity has brought
problems in the form of hygiene regulations that seem to militate against
traditionalism.
The EC is now pressing for the pasteurisation of buffalo milk, to the dismay
of producers. Says Mr Jemma, who himself pasteurises his milk: 'The best,
the pure type of mozzarella is made with unpasteurised milk - what does the
EC know about mozzarella?'
Exports of buffalo mozzarella require air transport to ensure top quality.
This is particularly expensive because of the need for the cheese to be
transport with liquid - at least a kilogram to every kilogram of mozzarella.
Producers argue that in order to export successfully they will need a
subsidy, and an application for this is now in progress.
Machine-made buffalo mozzarella lasts about five times longer than
hand-made. Transportation without liquid also extends its shelf-life. Some
companies vacuum pack their exports, in which case the mozzarella will last
for more than 30 days.
However, producers tend to turn up their noses at the consumers of this type
of product. In the south, mozzarella is considered no longer edible after
two days and is used for pasta and pizza recipes. One producer who vacuum
packs his cheese for consumption in the US, commented: 'As far as I'm
concerned, they're not eating mozzarella at all'.
It seems then that buffalo farmers will aim for the top section of the
market, and leave the bulk to the cheaper cows' milk product.
In spite of the complaints of producers, the widespread use of ordinary
mozzarella has probably helped the buffalo type. Now the lesser product has
been thoroughly absorbed into eating habits, people will be prepared,
perhaps, to pay dearly for the very best.

THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States represents the 'last great frontier
for minerals exploration and development' but there are daunting challenges
facing any western company wanting to share in that development, according
to a new Financial Times Management Report.
At the same time, every mining company needs to monitor very closely changes
in the CIS's mining and economic policies so as to gauge accurately the
total impact of new mining development on international commodity markets,
says the author, Mr James Dorian.
The evidence suggests that at present much of the CIS metallurgical sector
is in crisis, he says, with 25 to 40 per cent of the ferrous metal
industry's capacity being idle, together with 40 to 65 per cent of
non-ferrous capacity.
'With little or no experience in supervising mining development activities,
the former republics are having to grapple with tremendous problems and
difficulties historically handled at a distance by Moscow authorities,' he
adds.
Nevertheless, foreign mining companies are rushing to do business in the
former Soviet Union because it possesses some of the largest reserves of
oil, gas, gold and diamonds found anywhere in the world. The Russian
Federation is by far the wealthiest of the new independent states,
accounting for about 90 per cent of CIS oil output and most of the gold,
diamonds, platinum and base metals production. As much as 40 per cent of the
world's remaining reserves of crude oil are in the Russian province of
Siberia.
After Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are the next two wealthiest republics.
'The potential for further mineral discoveries in the new CIS is immense,
with the most attractive areas occurring in the Russian Federation (Far East
region and Siberia), Kazakhstan and the Caucasus region,' the report adds.
However, although the republics are welcoming foreign technology and
know-how, potential foreign investors may have to endure years of legal
wrangling as fledgling mining laws are tested and ethnic groups dispute
mineral rights.
They will also have to grapple with the local economic and technological
problems.
Other barriers to foreign entry include the CIS's lack of information on
industrial enterprises, poor infrastructure, unclear decision-making
hierarchy, non-convertible, non-existent or new, untested currencies and
conflicts over ownership rights to resources in numerous autonomous regions.
The report points out there are more than 200 ethnic groups in the new CIS
and says minerals-rich Uzbekistan 'has a high potential for inter-ethnic
unrest, as does Kyrgyzstan and, to a lesser extent, Kazakhstan. Areas of
possible conflict over mineral resource rights in Russia include the
republic of Sakha (also known as Yakutia) and the autonomous regions and
areas in western Siberia.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway and Iceland in bitter
fishing row
</HEADLINE>

NORWAY AND Iceland have become embroiled in a bitter dispute over fishing
rights in a huge undeclared zone in the Barents Sea where Arctic cod spawn.
There are no signs yet of an end to the row after two days of discussions
between the two Nordic countries.
A modern fleet of 21 Icelandic trawlers is expected to arrive in the
disputed zone this week to join two vessels already there to fish Arctic cod
in blatant defiance of their Norwegian counter-parts, who have threatened to
destroy their nets unless they vacate the area.
Mr Johan Joergan Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister, this week failed to
win assurances from Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, Iceland's foreign minister,
to prevent his fisherman from exploiting the 62,400 sq km zone. The two
ministers had been engaged in serious discussions over the dispute on Monday
and Tuesday and the Icelandic government was split over what could or should
be done in response to Norway's strong objections to fishing in the area.
The disputed area, which falls outside the jurisdiction of both Norway and
Russia, is a major spawning ground for Arctic cod, which eventually make
their way to both Norwegian and Russian waters and on which those countries'
cod quotas are partly based. Norway not only fears that fishing by the
Icelanders will set a precedent signifying the area is open to one and all
but that it will also upset the spawning ground.
This could restrict or inhibit the cod growth development and, in the end,
force Norway to reduce quotas, which it has been able cautiously to increase
in recent years following positive results of stringent resource management
during the 1980s.
NRK national radio reported from Iceland that a further 20 to 30 Icelandic
trawlers also planned to head towards the disputed area if the cod catches
proved sufficient to return a profit. One estimate put the value of a cod
catch from the area by 15 vessels manned by less than 20 fisherman each at
NKr100m (Pounds 9.1m).
Meanwhile, the Norwegian coast guard was stepping up surveillence of the
area and using Orion type aircraft to monitor the Icelandic trawlers.
Norway claims that already this year some 470 tonnes of Arctic fish have
been caught in the disputed area by six vessels registered under Caribbean
flags. Last year two of the vessels, Norway claims, caught 2,178 tonnes of
cod while in 1991 four vessels - two from Greenland and two from France -
caught 1,570 tonnes.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany seeks 'green' currency
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY HAS called for a moratorium on revaluations of the 'green' currency
rate at which European Community support prices are translated into D-Marks
to protect its farmers from further cuts in earnings.
It also wants an emergency meeting of EC agriculture ministers to be called
to discuss the operation of the green currency system in the aftermath of
the crisis which undermined the community's exchange rate mechanism at the
end of last month.
Government spokesman Mr Norbert Schaefer told a news conference in Bonn
yesterday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked the European Commission and
the Belgian EC presidency to suspend revaluations of the green D-Mark
pending the emergency meeting. He said Mr Jochen Borchert, Germany's
agriculture minister, had requested the council meeting to discuss ways of
averting damage to farmers whose national currencies had effectively been
revalued as a result of the widening of fluctuation bands for currencies in
the ERM to 15 per cent from August 2.
A Belgian government official told the Reuter news agency, however, that
there would be no emergency meeting this week. 'For the moment there is no
reason to call such a meeting,' he said. 'Next week it is possible, but it
all depends on the evolution of exchange rates and both the mark and guilder
edged down a bit on Tuesday.'
Asked if a meeting would be called if there was a drop in German green
rates, the official said it was up to Mr Andre Bourgeois, the Belgian farm
minister and current president of the EC farm council. But Mr Bourgeois was
out of touch on holiday in Italy and had not yet been informed of the German
request.
A commission official explained, meanwhile, that green rate changes were
automatic and could not be suspended by the commission. 'It's an automatic
thing,' he said. 'There's nothing we can do about it even if we want to.'
'The (green rate adjustment) regulation is a council regulation. It's up to
the ministers if they want to change the regulation.'
However, farming industry officials in Brussels said they thought that only
the Dutch were likely to back the Germans in seeking a change in the system.
They also suggested that Germany was playing to its farm audience rather
than expecting any real change in the system.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices at Australian sales this week eased again, and the pace of the
decline accelerated a little. The AWC market indicator was only 2 cents down
at 430 cents a kilogram on August 18 but fleece wool eased in the 5 to 10
cent range. Trade comment mentions the Garnaut wool report, published last
week, as an additional reason for market dullness. A fixed schedule for
stockpile disposal by tender raises new uncertainties in a trade already
unhappy about the inadequacy of world demand to absorb current production
and stocks.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenyan tea output record
forecast
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S tea production rose by 22.42m kg in the first half of 1993, compared
with the same period last year, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The rise gave
weight to predictions that a record output would be achieved by the end of
the year, a leading brokerage firm said.
'The crop figure for the month of June 1993 has been announced at 17,053,611
kg, showing an increase of 2,836,090 kg or 19.95 per cent over the same
period in 1992,' said the Mombasa-based African Tea Brokers.
'The cumulative figure (for end-June) now stands at 113.42m kg - an increase
of 22.42m kg or 24.64 per cent over last year,' ATB said.
The brokers said that growing areas had reported low temperatures and
isolated showers earlier this year, but it has recently warmed up.
The Kenya Tea Board forecast in March that output could rise to a record
210m kg in 1993, from 188.1m kg last year and 203.6m kg in 1991.
But the record estimate was threatened in the early months of the year by
low temperatures, after scattered seasonal rain fell in all tea-growing
areas.
ATB said that 161,188 packages were sold in four auctions at an average
price of 102.66 Kenyan shillings (Dollars 1.57 at current prices) in June,
compared with 189,200 packages at 57.10 shillings (Dollars 1.73 at last
year's prices) in the same period last year.
Although auction prices have risen in local currency terms, devaluations of
about 60 per cent since January have wiped out these gains in hard currency
terms.
The brokers said the market for all teas declined with closing rates below
opening levels in June, especially for brighter grades, because of selective
buying from Britain and Pakistan - among the top buyers of Kenyan teas.

Robusta COFFEE futures continued to surge at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday as signs of a pick-up in roaster interest added to the buoyant
mood encouraged by news earlier in the week that African producers would
join in the export retention scheme adopted by their Latin American
counterparts. The November position closed at Dollars 1,215 a tonne, up
Dollars 39 on the day, taking the rise on the week so far to Dollars 93.
London COCOA futures were boosted by the New York market's break through
stubborn resistance, but the sterling-denominated market was held back by
the pound's firmness. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM provided the
main feature as a battle developed around a key support level of Dollars
1,170 a tonne for three months metal. It managed to close 50 cents above
that level operators trying to trigger US investment fund liquidation were
countered by equally determined buyers. NICKEL took an early fall to a new
six-year low of Dollars 4,640 as speculative selling and trade hedging of
Russian metal continued. But it steadied on short-covering.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Equities: Mexican soft drinks bottler plans
Dollars 150m global share offer

COCA-COLA FEMSA, the Mexican soft drinks bottler, is hoping to raise up to
Dollars 150m from domestic and international investors with a share
offering.
The company is a joint venture between FEMSA, Mexico's largest beverage
company, and the Coca-Cola Company, which acquired a 30 per cent equity
stake in the company in April 1993 for Dollars 195m.
FEMSA is reducing its stake in the venture from 70 per cent to 51 per cent
by offering 19 per cent (equivalent to 82m shares) to the public.
About 20 per cent of the shares (16.4m of common stock) will be offered to
domestic investors, while 4.9m American depositary shares (ADSs) or 60 per
cent of the stake will be offered in the US. The remaining 20 per cent or
1.64m ADSs will be offered to European investors.
Each ADS represents 10 Series L shares and will be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, while the Series L shares will be listed on the Mexican
exchange.
The indicated pricing is Dollars 17 to Dollars 19 per ADS. Bear Stearns is
global co-ordinator for the offering.
FEMSA had already indicated that it would separate the soft drinks division
from the rest of the company once the Coca-Cola transaction was completed.
Coca-Cola said yesterday it had signed a letter of intent for a joint
venture Dollars 30m bottling plant in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei
province of China, Reuter reports from New York.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts hit by profit-taking as rate cut
hopes recede

UK GOVERNMENT bonds weakened across the board as the prospect of an interest
rate cut appeared to recede and some investors took profits.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said in a TV interview
that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, was 'satisfied with
the present level of interest rates'. The news dampened hopes of a cut in
the base rate, currently at 6 per cent, and short-dated gilts fell around
3/16 on the day.
The inflation and retail sales figures released yesterday did not make much
impact on the market, dealers said, as they were in line with expectations.
The annual inflation rate edged up in July to 1.4 per cent, from 1.2 per
cent in June, while underlying inflation (which strips out the effects of
mortgage interest payments) inched up from 2.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent,
which is still well within the government's target of 1 to 4 per cent.
Trading was mainly futures-driven, and the Liffe gilt future ended at
113.11, against the previous close of 113.21, having moved in a range of
113.07 to 113.31.
ANOTHER bout of rate-cut speculation invigorated some European government
bond markets yesterday, with Spain and Italy seeing some early buying
interest, although initial enthusiasm appeared to wane in the course of the
day.
The French government bond market closed higher, buoyed by the strength of
the franc and hopes of further easings by the central bank.
There was some speculation that the overnight rate may be lowered again as
early as today at the repo, following Tuesday's 50 basis point cut to 8.75
per cent.
Meanwhile, trading in German government bonds was lacklustre as the market
awaited the release of M3 money supply figures. The Liffe bund future opened
at 97.36 and traded at 97.22 by late afternoon.
TRADING in Australian government bonds was volatile in the wake of the
country's federal budget, announced late on Tuesday.
Traders initially sold off Australian bonds, focusing on a budget forecast
of an increase in Australia's headline inflation rate from the current 1.9
per cent to 3.5 per cent by the end of 1994.
This saw yields on 10-year Commonwealth bonds jump from 6.8 per cent before
the budget to over 7 per cent in offshore trading, eventually peaking at 7.1
per cent in early Australian trading yesterday.
But the sell-off was reversed in late trade, with yields easing to 6.9 per
cent as traders refocused on the likelihood of another official interest
rate cut before the year-end.
Among shorter-dated securities, the Reserve Bank's treasury note auction
yesterday saw yields ease from 4.790 per cent to 4.595 per cent on 13-week
notes.
PORTUGAL will issue up to Es750bn of fixed-rate treasury bonds this year,
Es150bn more than originally planned, Reuter reports. The government is to
reduce its planned issue of family savings certificates by Es150bn to Es50bn
so there would be no increase in the overall volume of debt issued.
'Raising the limit of Treasury bond issues was foreseeable, particularly if
we wanted to increase the depth of the market and its liquidity, so this
should be viewed simply as a routine measure,' Treasury director Mr Manuel
Pinho said.
IN THE US, the yield curve continued to flatten yesterday as the long end
posted strong gains while the short end slumbered.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  23/32 at 99
7/8 , yielding 6.255 per cent, yet another new record low for the issue. At
the short end of the market, the two-year note was up only 1/16 at 100 17/32
, to yield 3.946 per cent.
Traders put the early gains among longer-dated securities down to a
follow-through from overnight demand on foreign markets, especially in
Japapn, and to some futures-related buying. Volume was light throughout the
day, which magnified the impact of early buying. Continued speculation that
the Federal Reserve would buy securities outright via a coupon pass also
fuelled demand at the long end.
Bonds have risen to new highs mainly because economic fundamentals are still
positive - the economy continues to grow slowly, and inflation remains low -
and supply pressures are no longer a concern now that the final 30-year
issue of 1993 is out of the way.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Pricing of Denmark's Dollars 1bn FRN
deal creates confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICING of the Kingdom of Denmark's Dollars 1bn offering of
floating-rate notes (FRNs) prompted some confusion in the international bond
market yesterday.
According to the terms of the four-year deal, arranged by Lehman Brothers,
Denmark appeared to be paying an all-in cost of nine basis points below the
London interbank offered rate (Libor).
This initially baffled syndicate managers at the other banks which had been
invited to bid for the mandate, since they had shown much more aggressive
pricing proposals to the borrower.
Denmark's National Bank said that Lehman Brothers had attached a 'structure'
to the deal which enabled the Kingdom to come away with an all-in cost of
more than 10 basis points below Libor. However, it to give further details.
Lehman Brothers also declined to comment on what happened behind the scenes.
It said the issue had received a good reception in eastern Asia and in
Europe, partly because the pricing was not as tight as the market had
expected.
The fact that there was no call option on the issue made the notes
attractive to investors who believe US interest rates will start climbing
again before the notes mature, Lehman said.
The notes, which carry a coupon of  1/8 of a basis point below Libor, were
re-offered at their issue price of par. They are expected to be freed to
trade today.
The Eurodollar sector was tapped late in the day by Exxon Capital Corp, the
financing arm of the US oil giant, which raised Dollars 250m through an
offering of 15-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 1/8 per cent, were priced to yield 37
basis points over the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003.
Philips Electronics NV also raised dollars but launched its Dollars 500m
offering in the 'Yankee' market - the US domestic market for foreign
borrowers.
Lead-manager Goldman Sachs said that the triple-B credit rating of the Dutch
company had not yet recovered sufficiently to enable it to tap the
international bond market. However, the deeper US domestic market was able
to accommodate borrowers with weaker credits, the firm said.
The offering from the Dutch company was divided into two tranches of Dollars
250m, one with a maturity of 10 years and the other with a life of 20 years.
The bonds due in 2003 were priced to yield 110 basis points over 10-year US
Treasuries while the bonds due in 2013 were priced at a yield spread of 105
basis points over the 30-year US Treasury, which is traditionally used to
determine the pricing for long-dated bonds.
Elsewhere, Rabobank Nederland, the triple A-rated Dutch bank, raised L200bn
through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. A syndicate manager involved in the
deal said that the borrower had swapped the proceeds of the issue into
floating-rate dollars, achieving a borrowing cost of 25 basis points below
Libor.
The bonds, which have a coupon of 9 per cent, were re-offered at 100.25 and
they were quoted at 100.30 bid when freed to trade.
Dixons Group, the UK electrical retailer, has signed a Pounds 225m revolving
credit facility with a number of international banks. The facility, arranged
by NatWest Capital Markets, includes about Pounds 140m which has a
three-year maturity.

THE COMMODITY Futures Trading Commission, the primary regulator of the US
futures industry, is asking for public comment on applications from the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to be exempted
from many of the agency's rules.
The 60-day comment period could set the stage for a significant change in
the agency's way of treating institutional transactions on organised
exchanges.
The CFTC, using new powers granted under its 1992 reauthorisation, exempted
off-exchange swap, hybrid, and energy contracts from its jurisdiction
earlier this year with relatively little public debate. Those exemptions
were for transactions not previously regulated by the CFTC.
The CBoT and CME argue that similar exemptions are due for their
institutionally-traded contracts.
The CME has specifically asked for regulatory relief for its new 'rolling
spot' currency products, which are aimed at interbank foreign exchange
traders.
The CFTC, noting that such exemptions would be a fundamental departure from
exchange regulation of the last 70 years, has made it clear it wants broad
public input before making a decision.
Mr Albrecht, acting CFTC chairman, said the CFTC's decision would depend 'in
large measure on what happens during the comment period'.
The agency is not in a strong position for landmark decision-making.
Mr Albrecht steps down from the Commission on Friday, leaving three seats
vacant on the five-member board.
Commissioners are nominated by the White House, and President Bill Clinton
has not yet named any choices for the CFTC.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications and computer group,
yesterday said it would close 40 offices and phase out 3,000 to 4,000 jobs
by early 1995, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Most of the job cuts will affect AT&amp;T operators.
The move, in response to the growing use of automated operator services, is
an extension of the company's 1992 plans to cut between 3,000 and 6,000
non-management and between 200 and 400 management jobs by the end of 1994.

<TEXT>
METALL Mining, the Canadian-based mining subsidiary of Germany's
Metallgesellschaft (MG) metals group, wants to concentrate more heavily on
copper production and refining. The group said yesterday it planned to buy a
large mining project.
Metall is 'aggressively pursuing' the acquisition of a large copper mining
project. The company currently has a modest exposure to copper. It is
developing the Izok Lake property in Canada's Northwest Territories,
believed to be North America's biggest undeveloped zinc and copper deposit.
Metall said it expected copper demand and prices to improve as countries in
south-east Asia, South America and eastern Europe expanded their housing,
infrastructure and communications facilities.
Expansion in copper smelting would also reduce the company's vulnerability
to changes in copper treatment charges, and improve its chances of acquiring
mining assets. Copper and other metal smelting charges have risen sharply in
the past two years.
The centrepiece of the company's plans is the possible acquisition of MG's
substantial copper smelting and refining assets. These include a 35 per cent
stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie of Hamburg, one of Europe's biggest copper
producers, and a 40 per cent interest in Austria's Montawerke Brixlegg.
Metall would pay a 'substantial portion' of the purchase price by issuing
common shares to MG. The German company presently has a 59 per cent stake in
Metall Mining. Metall directors have retained NM Rothschild, the UK merchant
bank, to prepare a valuation of MG's copper smelting assets.
Smelting capacity may also be increased at 87 per cent-owned Copper Range,
an integrated producer in northern Michigan. Copper Range is presently
conducting a feasibility study to expand smelting capacity from 75,000
tonnes to 135,000 tonnes.

FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forestry and energy group, reports
profits after abnormal items of NZDollars 381.8m (USDollars 213.3m) for the
year ended June, against a loss of NZDollars 157.5m last time.
The recovery reflects a turnround in abnormal items, to a surplus of
NZDollars 15.5m after a debit of NZDollars 472.8m a year ago.
The company plans a free issue of Fletcher Challenge Forest shares to
shareholders. These will reflect the value of the company's New Zealand and
Chilean forests, but not its pulp and paper industries.
About 50 per cent of the value of these assets would be reflected in the new
shares.

well received

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE flotation of Barito Pacific, the Indonesian wood products company, is
likely to be at least five times oversubscribed, say brokers backing the
issue. They base their estimates on investors' preliminary commitments.
Brokers in Jakarta say large funds, including Global Asset Management and
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GSIC), have requested
substantial stakes. The issue is intended to raise nearly Dollars 300m and
would value the company at over Dollars 2.5bn.
The company has been dogged by poor publicity since announcing its flotation
in July. It has denied allegations that its parent, Barito Pacific Group, is
burdened by debt. It also denies that the issue was damaged last month when
Salomon Brothers of the US withdrew as lead foreign co-ordinator of the
issue, reportedly on the grounds of inadequate financial disclosure by the
company.
Barito executives say Salomon Bros has since decided to support the issue as
a foreign selling agent, although brokers stress no written agreement had
been signed.
Brokers close to the deal say investor interest has been strongest in Hong
Kong and Singapore, and deny a lack of interest in New York, where only 13
potential investors attended the company's 'road show' presentation last
month.
Brokers say the GSIC, which has refused to comment on its intentions, has
requested a stake of at least Dollars 30m. The presence of GSIC would
reassure fund managers reluctant to commit funds without evidence of strong
foreign backing for the issue.

<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered
ratings of two leading Japanese banks due to mounting concerns over
deteriorating loan portfolios.
The long-term debt rating for Long-Term Credit Bank was cut to A3 from A2,
while-short term deposits were downgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
The agency also lowered long-term debt ratings of Norinchukin Bank, the
central agricultural financial institution, from Aa3 to A1. The Prime-1
rating for short-term deposits was confirmed.
Moody's said as well as disclosed non-performing loans, LTCB had a
substantial volume of loans to restructuring non-bank financial
institutions. It said LTCB faced risk posed by closely-linked real estate
companies and by non-bank financial institutions facing financial stress.
The agency expressed concern over Norinchukin's high exposure to housing
loan companies. Norinchukin's profits were depressed by the need to aid
low-margin operations of small agricultural co-operatives. The bank is also
increasing its reliance on securities gains to boost its earnings.
Earlier this week, Moody's lowered credit ratings of Asahi Bank, a Japanese
commercial bank, due to concerns over continuing vulnerability of asset
quality and outlook for weak core profits.

mill stake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CRA has agreed to sell its 48.02 per cent interest in the An Mau steel
rolling and coating mill in Taiwan. The price remains undisclosed, but is
higher than book value.
The group's 1992 annual report showed an equity carrying amount of ADollars
67.1m for the An Mau interest, and a ADollars 4.1m net profit contribution.
An Mau's 1992 sales were ADollars 320m.
CRA's interest will be sold to one of its Japanese partners in the An Mau
joint venture, Yodogawa Steel Works. The sale continues CRA's policy of
divesting non-core assets.
The sale is scheduled for completion by the end of 1993. CRA initially made
its investment in An Mau because the mill was potentially a direct user of
CRA products, but this is no longer the case.

The company yesterday announced a 33 per cent fall in net earnings, to

The result followed abnormal losses of ADollars 64.4m, reflecting provisions

The abnormals are not expected to be repeated in the current year, Leighton
said. It expects increased net earnings for 1993-94.

13.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATING profits for the German banking sector rose by 13.5 per cent last
year, reaching a total of DM40bn (Dollars 23.6bn), the Bundesbank has
calculated.
The main reason for the increase was a 10 per cent surge in earnings from
interest income, reflecting a DM9.5bn increase in bank lending volume, the
German central bank says in its August monthly report, published today.
As a result, the banks were able to improve interest margins and capital
ratios, in spite of the onset of recession in Germany in the second half of
last year, the Bundesbank found.
Recent interim figures from the banking sector showed that banks have
maintained their immunity to the downturn in the German economy, even as the
economy has deteriorated further during the current year.
This has been mainly because of strong profits on own-account trading,
though growth in interest income has also proved resilient.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Aga on course for higher profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, said it was on course to achieve
higher profits in 1993 as income after financial items rose by 4 per cent to
SKr766m (Dollars 95m) in the first half.
The figures continued the group's steady performance in the face of
difficult market conditions, but showed it was unable to reap the full
benefits of strong growth in sales and operating income because of high
interest costs.
Sales for the period were 32 per cent higher at SKr7.54bn. The company said
this was due to the depreciation of the Swedish krona and acquisitions.
Operating income was up 25 per cent at SKr792m.
However, the costs of financing the purchase of CEGF, the French cold
storage company, and the greater expense of servicing foreign loans with a
weaker krona, meant net financial costs were SKr158m higher than in the same
1992 period.
The group's performance would have been static but for the fact that its
share of income from the power company Gullspangs Kraft rose by SKr28m.
Aga said it was satisfied with the performance of its core gas operations,
considering the weak economic climate in most of its key markets.
Exchange rate factors lifted gas sales by 24 per cent to SKr5.45bn and
operating income by 14 per cent to SKr697m.
The cold storage and food processing business, Frigoscandia, saw sales rise
58 per cent to SKr2.09bn, mainly due to acquisitions. Operating income
soared to SKr95m from SKr22m.
Aga is sticking to an earlier forecast that full-year profits will exceed
last year's SKr1.48bn.
Mr Marcus Storch, the company's chief executive, said: 'The recession is
expected to continue throughout the year, although some recovery is
anticipated in the UK and the Nordic countries. Growth in the US is low and
the economic climate in Latin America is mixed.'

<TEXT>
VIAG, the German energy-based conglomerate, has forecast that profits for
the full year will be lower than last year, and reported pre-tax profits for
the six months to the end of June down from DM384m to DM305m. Group turnover
rose fractionally from DM12.08bn to DM12.14m.
The company said the downturn in Germany's economy hit the group's packaging
and trading subsidiaries especially hard in the first six months of the
year. There was likely to be no respite from recessionary pressure in the
second half, the Bonn-based group predicted.
On a more positive note, it said its core energy business was to a large
extent immune to the economic downturn and that profits in its chemicals
activities, as well as its Kuhne &amp; Nagel transport and logistics subsidiary,
would continue to develop positively in the second half of the current year.
It would make further efforts to establish a 'permanent improvement' in its
cost structures, Viag said, and the effects of a wide-ranging
rationalisation programme would make themselves felt in the second half.
After stripping out the effect of recent acquisitions, the number of
employees fell by 5 per cent year-on-year.
Viag is in negotiations with the government of the state of Bavaria to
participate in the planned privatisation of Bayernwerk , the largest
southern German energy utility in which Viag already has a 39 per cent stake
and which in turn has a 24.9 per cent stake in Viag .

deficit

<TEXT>
DEPRESSED freight rates pushed Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and road haulage
group, into a Fl 116m (Dollars 60m) net loss for the 1993 first half from a
slim profit of Fl 1m a year earlier.
The company, which described the result as 'most unsatisfactory', said
results in the second half were expected to show clear improvement, though
the figure would remain negative.
In a breakdown of developments over the first six months, Nedlloyd said a
'low point' was reached in the first quarter when losses totalled Fl 86m.
This was followed by a narrowing of losses to Fl 30m in the second quarter.
The ocean-shipping division swung into an operating loss of Fl 62m in the
first half from a Fl 34m profit a year earlier. Although land-based
transport and distribution remained profitable, operating results fell to Fl
5m from Fl 8m.
The company said it was not clear whether road haulage second-half results
would match those in the same period of 1992 because of continuing recession
in Europe.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Electrolux interim result better
than expected

ELECTROLUX, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers, saw its
shares rise by 4 per cent yesterday after it produced a better-than-expected
first-half profit of SKr763m (Dollars 95m).
The result was up fractionally on profits of SKr758m in the same 1992 period
and followed an increase in second-quarter profits to SKr561m from SKr505m.
Sales surged to SKr49.6bn from SKr40.8bn in the first half, almost entirely
because of the impact of currency movements rather than increased volumes.
The company noted that market conditions continued to be difficult, with
demand generally weaker in Europe but better in North America.
Operating income after depreciation rose by 6 per cent to SKr1.6bn as a
result of a better performance in most countries. The two main exceptions
were North America and Spain, where the company's total operating income
from household appliances fell by SKr500m.
Electrolux has been hit by heavy product launch costs in North America,
while the company's Spanish activities have suffered from weak market
conditions and from the impact of an 'inflexible labour market' on its
restructuring efforts.
Analysts said that they welcomed signs that the company's long-running
problems in North America were being resolved and said that they were
encouraged by the company's assessment that its income in the region should
gradually improve in the second half.
They also noted the performance of the group's outdoor products division,
where sales rose 43 per cent to SKr8.25bn from SKr5.76bn.
Sales in the group's main division, household appliances, rose a more modest
17.8 per cent to SKr27.0bn from SKr22.9bn. Industrial product sales were up
22.5 per cent to SKr8.93bn, while commercial appliance sales rose 13.4 per
cent to SKr4.98bn.
Outdoor products and industrial products improved their operating income
during the period, while household and commercial appliances both registered
a decline.
The latest figures included a SKr200m gain from the sale of most of the
company's stake in the Australian company Email, but this was entirely
offset by a capital loss on the disposal of the company's direct sales
operation in France.
Mr Colin Gibson, analyst with Carnegie in London, said he now expected
Electrolux's full year profits to exceed 1992's SKr1bn level.
Electrolux B shares closed at SKr273, up SKr11 since Tuesday's close.

JYSKE Bank, the first of the larger Danish banks to report on the first
half, moved to a profit this year of DKr394m (Dollars 57m) from an operating
loss of DKr479m in 1992.
Net interest and fee income soared by 33 per cent to DKr1.06bn from DKr795m.
Provisions declined to DKr387m from DKr677m, and the adjustment for the
market value of securities since the end of last year added DKr382m to
profits, compared with only DKr57m last year.
The bank made an unrealised loss of DKr135m in the recent currency turmoil,
but maintained an earlier forecast that operating earnings for the year will
be in the region of DKr150m to DKr250m, compared with a loss of DKr913m for
the whole of 1992.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Higher financial costs put SAS
in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) slumped SKr609m (Dollars 75.7m) into the
red in the first half of 1993, a SKr1.1bn turnround on its performance in
the same 1992 period.
The airline blamed a big rise in financial costs, but also said fierce
competition, recession, and depressed traffic volumes in Sweden had
aggravated its losses. Yields fell 6 per cent overall and by 13 per cent in
domestic Swedish traffic.
The tone was considerably more gloomy than in March, when the airline
announced a 1992 loss of SKr743m, but it declined to make a full-year
forecast because of the impact of market deregulation, restructuring and
unrest in the foreign exchange markets.
The company has been discussing a link-up with KLM, Swissair and Austrian
Airlines, and said yesterday it expected to start talks on an 'airline
constellation with a joint balance sheet' soon.
Operating revenue for the first half rose 8 per cent to SKr18.9bn. However,
the company made a loss after depreciation of SKr145m, against a SKr708m
profit in the first half of 1992.
The deficit was aggravated by SKr1.1bn in financial losses, stemming from a
weaker krona, higher interest costs and increased net debt, leaving it with
a loss before financial items of SKr1.23bn, compared with a SKr484m profit.
The bottom line would have been even worse if the airline had not made a
SKr554m gain on the sale of its terminal catering and contract catering
businesses in June. This helped restrict the pre-tax deficit to SKr609m,
after last year's SKr502m profit.
'Deregulation in Europe and overcapacity in the industry, combined with the
recession, have resulted in intense competition and a general fall in
yields,' SAS stated. It said the competition meant it had not been able to
increase fares in line with the depreciation of the Swedish krona.
SAS also noted that Sweden, its most important market, was a conspicuous
exception to a pattern of recovery in international air transport volumes,
and said recession had scarred many of its other operations, such as SAS
Leisure Group. The Swedish domestic air market was deregulated in July 1992.
Bright spots for the company were an 8 per cent rise in revenue passenger
kilometres and a 6 per cent increase in production. Passenger numbers rose 3
per cent to 9.2m.
The airline's equity/assets ratio weakened to 19 per cent as at June 30,
compared with 23 per cent at the end of 1992.

LUFTHANSA, the German state-controlled airline, has given Austrian Airlines
(AUA) until early next month to decide on proposals for a business
co-operation agreement, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
The proposed agreement has been the subject of intensive discussions between
the two airlines in recent weeks, culminating yesterday in a meeting between
senior executives from both airlines. These included Mr Rudolf Streicher,
chairman of AUA's supervisory board, and Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief
executive.
The agreement envisages close co-operation in business areas such as
passenger services, marketing, cargo, maintenance and flight operations. If
adopted, it could deal a blow to the Alcazar project, a proposed link-up
between AUA and other European airlines Swissair, SAS and KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines.

FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Acquisition boosts Credit Suisse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Suisse, the flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group,
has reported a 67 per cent jump in consolidated profits before taxes and
provisions in the first half of 1993 to SFr2.4bn (Dollars 1.59bn), and
forecast 'good profits' for the full year.
The profit growth rate was flattered by the inclusion, for the first time,
of the results of Swiss Volksbank, which was acquired by CS Holding for
SFr1.6bn in mid-April.
Excluding the Volksbank contribution, Credit Suisse's pre-tax profits grew
by 51 per cent.
Like Union Bank of Switzerland, which last Thursday reported a 58 per cent
rise in first-half profits before taxes and provisions to SFr2.76bn, Credit
Suisse said buoyant trading income was the main contributor to its growth.
The group's profits from securities and foreign exchange trading nearly
doubled to SFr1.53bn, with 20 per cent of the growth coming from the
addition of Volksbank's trading results.
Trading, which has long been a strong point at Credit Suisse, surpassed
lending to become the group's largest source of earnings.
The inclusion of Volksbank business accounted for roughly half of the 47 per
cent gain in commission income to SFr1.23bn, and provided all of the 27 per
cent gain in net interest income to SFr1.51bn.
Group expenses jumped by 38 per cent to SFr1.99bn, with Credit Suisse's own
costs rising only 8.7 per cent.
Credit Suisse said that the process of uniting the two banks had been
progressing well. Expenses were lower in the second quarter than in the
first, indicating that synergies were already occurring.
Credit Suisse did not reveal a figure for bad loans provisions at the
interim stage. However, it said that the difficult business climate and
continuing structural adjustments meant that substantial provisions would
again be necessary. Last year's provisions rose 34 per cent to a record
SFr1.5bn.
The acquisition cost of Volksbank was roughly SFr640m below the disclosed
net worth of the bank. Credit Suisse subsequently realised SFr170m through
the sale of Volksbank shares held in Volksbank's own treasury.
It has since transferred the remaining SFr472m of this 'badwill' from the
bank's capital reserves to a special provision to cover anticipated
restructuring costs.
The group's total assets reached SFr229.4bn at the end of June, 33 per cent
higher than at the end of last year, mainly as a result of the Volksbank
acquisition.
This almost certainly means that Credit Suisse has surpassed Swiss Bank
Corporation to become Switzerland's second-largest bank after UBS, with
total assets of SFr290.7bn at the end of June.
CS Holding, which also owns Bank Leu and other banks, has become the
largest.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood Computer drops 69% to Pounds
541,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHERWOOD COMPUTER Services, which earlier this month saw its shares fall by
almost a third following a profits warning, is maintaining its interim
dividend at 1.75p.
Bearing out the warning, pre-tax profits tumbled 69 per cent to Pounds
541,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 1.75m
previously. That period benefited from an exceptional gain of Pounds 522,000
following reorganisation of the company's pension scheme.
The shares, which hit a five-year high of 350p at the end of February,
closed yesterday at 145p, up 1p.
The group suffered an operating loss of Pounds 315,000 (Pounds 1.6m profit)
on continuing operations, but made an operating profit of Pounds 747,000
from recent acquisitions. The purchases helped lift turnover to Pounds 11.8m
(Pounds 10.7m).
Sherwood, which has developed specialist software for the housing and
insurance markets, put most of the blame for the profits fall on 'the well
publicised difficulties in the Lloyd's insurance market.'
Mr George Matthews, chief executive, said the company had sold no licensed
software in either sector in the first half. Reorganisations and
contractions had deferred orders at Lloyd's, while the switch from poll tax
to council tax had delayed orders from local authorities.
The group closed two licence sales in the housing sector last month, and was
expecting to sell two more in the second half. The insurance sector was
showing good prospects for 1994, Mr Matthews said.
After minorities of Pounds 203,000, fully diluted earnings per share fell to
3.4p (16.7p).

WITH ALL businesses contributing and offshore operations producing record
figures, Rea Brothers, the private banking group, lifted pre-tax profit from
Pounds 284,000 to Pounds 802,000 in the first half of 1993.
Principal activities include banking, investment management, corporate
finance and trust and company administration.
The effect of low short term interest rates on earnings from capital had
been offset by increased banking and investment activity. Fund management
had a 'particularly good' six months.
Benefit came from a reduction in doubtful debts from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds
21,000. But Pounds 175,000 was provided in anticipation of certain costs
relating to the return to Alderman's House following damage from the
Bishopsgate bomb in April.
Earnings rose to 1.42p (0.26p) and the interim dividend rises to 0.3p
(0.25p).

<TEXT>
SECOND-QUARTER profits of Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian food processor 56
per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings of the UK, slipped by 6 per cent
through competitive pressures and lower interest income.
Net profits fell to CDollars 16.9m (Pounds 8.58m) for earnings of 20 cents a
share, against CDollars 20m, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose from
CDollars 678.2m to CDollars 742.4m.
Interest income dropped to CDollars 1.6m (CDollars 2.6m). The group had cash
reserves of CDollars 168m at June 30, compared with CDollars 201m a year
earlier. Long-term debt climbed from CDollars 28m to CDollars 45.4m.
The company painted a brighter picture of prospects for the remainder of the
year. Mr Brent Ballantyne, newly-appointed chief operating officer, said the
retail sector was showing signs of recovery, while good summer weather
should boost prepared meats and bakery volumes.
Grocery products, bakeries and flour milling were among the businesses which
were hit by competitive and other pressures in the second quarter.
Maple Leaf was re-examining the future of its food service division, which
supplies restaurants, hospitals and other institutions.
On the other hand, agribusiness earnings improved significantly.
Fresh pork and poultry operations benefited from plant consolidation and
cost-cutting. Frozen food profits were also higher.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: City Centre Restaurants up at Pounds 4.76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY CENTRE Restaurants, which owns, among others, the Garfunkels and Deep
Pan Pizza chains, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.32m to Pounds 4.76m
in the six months to June 30.
However, Mr Phillip Kaye, chief executive, described the group's growth in
the first half as 'slight'.
In particular, London, home of the 35 Garfunkels outlets, had been dreadful
until July 1, he said, when tourists seemed to arrive.
This was not helped by the fact that most of the Garfunkels restaurants had
been refurbished in the period under review, using most of the Pounds 3m of
capital expenditure.
The group had no borrowings and cash balances of Pounds 12m at the end of
June. This should rise to about Pounds 16m by the end of the year, said Mr
Kaye.
He ascribed the profits rise mostly to the just under 100-strong Deep Pan
Pizza chain.
As a volume business, he said that the promotions the chain had been running
for the past two years had been crucial. He added that margins under the
promotions - whereby you could eat as much as you liked from the pizza and
pasta buffets for Pounds 2.50, now risen to Pounds 3.25 - were 'not as tight
as you'd think. They are only tight when you don't have the volume'.
A further benefit of the promotions has been that 'they destroy the
competition'.
Some 40 Deep Pans are attached to cinemas, and Mr Kaye said that the film
Jurassic Park had done wonders for the trade in those outlets.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating profits to
Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 4.06m). The interim dividend is traditionallynot
increased at half-time and is again 0.45p, payable from earnings of 1.68p
(1.57p).
COMMENT
City Centre Restaurants, now valued at about Pounds 160m, has rather sneaked
up on the rails, and this sums up the style of the group. It has ridden out
the recession by quietly, carefully getting on with its business, which Mr
Kaye describes as 'one of the most straightforward and tidy ones you could
find. We just run restaurants'. The group resisted the temptations to which
many others in the leisure sector succumbed in the late-1980s, and
consequently has not fallen at any fences. Mr James Naylor, once of First
Leisure and latterly Whitegate Leisure, is set to take the reins from Mr
Kaye in October, and one hopes he will not feel it necessary to divert the
group from its track. Pencilled in pre-tax profits of about Pounds 12.5m for
the year give a multiple of just over 19, a deserved premium.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Broadcastle restores pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite little improvement in trading conditions and generally lower
margins, Broadcastle produced a first half net profit which more than
matched the whole of 1992.
The financial services group also announced a return to the dividend list.
The expansion was achieved by the application of 'good housekeeping
principles' and the careful selection of business, the directors explained.
On turnover of Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.29m) for the six months to June 30,
pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 155,000) and the net
balance at Pounds 202,000 (Pounds 77,000).
For the 1992 year the net balance was Pounds 185,000.
Directors were 'sufficiently encouraged' by the results to restore
dividends, and declared an interim of 0.25p from earnings per share of 1.22p
(0.48p).
They forecast a final dividend of 0.5p.
It is intended to build the group, through Harton Securities, to the level
of the minimum capital required under EC banking regulations.
'This will be done as quickly as is consistent with the exercise of prudent
judgment.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance lifts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITANNIC Assurance, the life assurance company, yesterday announced an
improvement in its interim dividend to 3.85p, against 3.433p.
'We anticipate that the life assurance business will be strong this year,'
said Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, explaining the dividend
increase.
Britannic, like other life assurance companies, is not required to release
interim profits figures.
Shareholders are currently entitled to 9.7 per cent of the profits of the
with-profits pool, and Mr Shaw noted that 'the market expectation is that we
will move to 10 per cent by the year end.'
That level, he said, is in line with the industry average and is already
reflected in Britannic's share price. Several proprietary life assurance
companies have recently taken steps to give shareholders a greater
proportion of the profits reserved for policyholders.
Britannic said that its general insurance businesses had sharply reduced
underwriting losses for the six months ended June 30 to Pounds 1.43m,
against Pounds 2.3m last year.
Premium income increased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 17.9m, while investment
income rose marginally to Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 1.57m).
Mr Shaw said that losses paid out on theft claims on home insurance appear
to have steadied to last year's levels.
However, the company is still paying out roughly 60 per cent of premium
income in theft claims - up from the historical level of 30 per cent.
In its life business, Britannic reported strong rises in premium income in
all branches, although its industrial branch business - in which premiums
are collected door-to-door - experienced smaller rises.
In ordinary branch business, pensions sales surged from Pounds 57.8m to
Pounds 68.6m, while in unit linked business, sales of life assurance
products roughly doubled to Pounds 7.33m.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Better margins boost Rosebys and current
period starts well
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSEBYS, the retailer of household textiles, curtains and accessories,
lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 681,000 in the six
months to June 26.
Historically the majority of profits come in the second half, according to
Mr Roy Waudby, chairman.
He added that so far in the current period 'we have experienced a most
welcome increase in like for like sales.'
In the first half turnover reached Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 20.9m).
Operating profit jumped to Pounds 737,000 (Pounds 560,000) reflecting
improved margins and strict cost controls.
Margins further improved, Mr Waudby said, as a result of continuing the
overseas buying policy.
Consequently both stocks and net borrowings were higher than normal at the
period end, amounting to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.9m) and Pounds 4m (Pounds
1.8m) respectively.
During the period the number of branches in England and Wales were increased
to 148.
Since then three more had been opened and it was expected that at least 10
others would be operative in the second half, of which seven would be sited
in Scotland.
Earnings per share improved to 2.3p (1.9p).
The interim dividend goes up to 1.4p (0.9p).
The company was floated in March 1992.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Richardsons Westgarth rises 37% but warns
on second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARDSONS Westgarth, the steel stockholder and processor, achieved a 37
per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.42m, for
the first half of 1993.
The outcome was achieved on turnover some 23 per cent higher at Pounds
32.3m.
Nevertheless, the shares closed 2p lower at 87p.
Mr Roger Payton, chairman, said that increased prices by steel producers and
lack of any sustained demand from customers were expected again to impact on
business in the second half.
In the 1992 year the group reported profit of Pounds 1.92m on sales of
Pounds 53.5m.
Net attributable profit for the half year came out at Pounds 950,000 (Pounds
750,000), giving earnings per share of 3.32p (2.84p). The interim dividend
is lifted from 1.25p to 1.3p.
Mr Kevin Middis, finance director, said yesterday that the group was not
seeing a lack of demand but the high level achieved in 'a very buoyant and
positive first quarter' had not been sustained in the second three months.
He said the company had gained market share in the north-east of England
against stiff competition and was expanding capacity in Yorkshire and
Scotland.
Mr Middis said analysts were looking for full year pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 2.5m, which he thought was reasonable.
He said it was 'extremely difficult to maintain margins at present'. The
demand pull was absent, he said.
Mr Payton said that a record 90,000 tonnes of steel was supplied to
customers, the increase of some 20,000 tonnes representing organic growth.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Ransomes suffers downturn to Pounds 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANSOMES, the grass cutting machinery maker, yesterday announced interim
results which, according to Mr John Kerridge, the new chairman, represented
a setback in its recovery programme.
At the pre-tax level profits for the six months to end-June fell from a
restated Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.21m on the back of a 12 per cent rise in
turnover to Pounds 89.7m. However, after adjusting for exchange rate
differences, the turnover increase was only 1 per cent.
Operating profits declined from Pounds 6.24m to Pounds 5.4m and losses per
share widened from 2.6p to 4.4p. Payment of a dividend on the convertible
preference shares, due on October 31, has been postponed. The company's
ordinary shares fell 5p to 19p.
Commercial grass machinery sales increased to Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 46.4m)
but at constant exchange rates declined by 9 per cent. The principal
shortfall arose in the US, which was adversely affected by a continuing
sluggish economy and adverse weather conditions.
The French market showed a significant decline while the performance in the
UK was flat with 'no evidence of any economic recovery affecting the group's
markets.'
Exports, however, were 'encouraging' with signs of markets in the Far East
showing continued growth.
At the operating level, profits of the commercial grass machinery activities
fell from Pounds 3.98m to Pounds 2.4m, while those of the consumer side
improved from Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.96m. With all divisions showing
improvements, sales of the consumer division advanced by 30 per cent to
Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 25.5m), or 23 per cent after adjusting for exchange
rate movements.
For the 1992 year better grass growing conditions helped Ransomes swing from
losses of Pounds 4.6m to profits of Pounds 900,000 pre-tax on turnover 6.7
per cent ahead at Pounds 156.6m.
At the half year end the group's bankers remained fully supportive of the
measures being adopted by the board.
Mr Kerridge joined Ransomes late last year after retiring for health reasons
as deputy chairman of Fisons.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: A building dilemma for forecasters -
Conflicting signals from the construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN WHICH direction is the UK construction industry heading? Analysts trying
to make sense of conflicting signals currently emanating from the industry
may be forgiven for feeling confused.
Their dilemma will not have been made easier by contrasting views about the
health of the market voiced yesterday by two of the industry's largest
companies.
BICC, owner of the Balfour Beatty construction company, and Marley, the
building materials group, both of which announced half year results
yesterday, expressed themselves very differently about prospects for the
sector.
Mr David Trapnell, chief executive of Marley, which supplies a wide range of
clay, concrete and plastic components to builders, spoke confidently about
an industry which had passed its worst. Recovery, he said, had slowed since
the spring but sales were still moving upwards, albeit more gradually.
Prices charged to customers, also, had improved although they still had a
long way to go to recover ground lost during the past 18 months, he said.
In contrast, Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC, spoke disparagingly of a
'disappointingly slow recovery' in the UK, North America and Australia. The
short-term trading outlook remained difficult, he said. Although the UK
economy was showing signs of stabilising, construction prices and
opportunities to tender for work were weak. Growth would have to come from
international markets, mainly from the Asia-Pacific region.
The main difference in the perspective of two companies is that while UK
housebuilding has improved other construction markets, notably office
development, remain deeply depressed because of over-building in the late
1980s.
Contracting and construction shares during the past 12 months have risen by
more than three quarters, according to the FT-Actuaries indices -
outperforming the FT-A All-Share index by more than 30 per cent. This makes
construction the fourth best performing share sector behind merchant banks,
other financials and commercial property.
Yet most forecasts from the industry expect construction output to fall by a
further 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year. Next year output is forecast
to rise by only about 1 per cent. This hardly suggests a robust recovery to
support such a strong rise in share prices.
The historic p/e ratio for contracting and construction shares has gone off
the scale at more than 80 (the FT-A indices do not measure sector ratios of
more than 80), while building material shares command a historic p/e of more
than 40.
Mr Leslie Kent, construction analyst with brokers Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, said
yesterday: 'These kinds of earnings multiples suggest an increase in
construction output and prices which we consider completely unrealistic
given the over-supply of contractors and building materials. This has not
been helped by the downturn in continental European construction markets.
'The British market is beginning to recover in some areas but progress is
gradual and is offset by continuing declines in other areas.'
Mr Trapnell says an improvement in new house sales and house repair and
maintenance during the spring boosted sales of bricks, roof tiles, aerated
concrete blocks, plastic plumbing and decorative products enabling the group
to put up some prices.
This improvement has not been matched by recovery in other areas of
construction, according to Mr Trapnell, who says the failure to replace
large scale works on the Channel tunnel, which have been completed, and
projects in London's Docklands has reduced opportunities for general
construction work.
BICC, a member of the Anglo-French consortium building the Channel tunnel,
has much higher exposure to commercial and industrial building markets as
well as large scale road, rail, water and electricity generation
infrastructure projects.
It, therefore, has proportionately less to gain from a housing recovery. Its
fortunes are more dependent upon investment decisions taken by government
ministers and company directors in other industrial and commercial sectors.
Companies, however, are unlikely to fully regain confidence until they see a
much greater improvement in consumer spending which depends in part on the
health of the housing market.
Mr Trapnell says the large sales increases reported by housebuilders in the
spring have subsequently slowed but this may be through normal seasonal
factors - as potential buyers depart for summer holidays - rather than the
recovery faltering.
Comparisons with a year ago of new house sales in September, October and
November may also be inconclusive. These will be measured against a dreadful
last autumn when the housing market virtually collapsed as interest rates
fluctuated wildly and sterling withdrew from the ERM.
Marley's view is that the UK housing market, after allowing for seasonal and
other distortions, has embarked on a gradual recovery which will lead to
house sales rising 'by perhaps 5 per cent a year rather than some of the big
jumps we have seen in previous recoveries.'
This may be encouraging for home owners and some hard pressed housebuilders
and building material companies but hardly seems sufficient to justify the
scale of share price increases seen in the sector during the past 12 months.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Housing pick ups project Marley into
doubled profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Marley more than doubled during the first six months of
this year from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 13.2m, as the building materials group
took advantage of housing market recoveries in the UK and US.
Comparisons with the 1992 first half, however, were flattered as those
figures included a Pounds 3.6m loss on disposals which previously had been
taken below the line.
Mr David Trapnell, chief executive, said figures were re-stated to take
account of the new FRS 3 accounting rules. A better guide to the group's
performance was the 33 per cent rise in operating profits from Pounds 13.1m
to Pounds 17.4m.
Earnings per share rose from 0.8p to 3p, more than covering a maintained
interim dividend of 2.1p.
Mr Chris Beenham, finance director, said the group would prefer to see
dividends covered at least two times by earnings before it increased
payments to shareholders.
Mr Trapnell said the biggest improvement had been at the heavy building
materials division which moved from a Pounds 700,000 operating loss to a
Pounds 1.6m profit.
Volume sales of concrete aerated blocks in the UK, mainly to the housing
market, had risen by about 11 per cent compared with the first half of last
year. Sales of roof tiles increased by some 7 per cent.
Cost savings, mainly in the UK where the labour force was reduced by 500 to
4,300, had added a further Pounds 4m to profits. Lower prices for clay and
concrete products compared with the first half of last year reduced this
gain to about Pounds 1m.
The group had managed to raise building materials prices during early summer
but had still not recovered to levels prevailing 12 months ago. Overall, UK
operating profits had more than doubled from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 5.3m.
The expanding automotive components business lifted its contribution to
profits from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 1.8m, helped by rising car sales in the
UK.
Profits from plastic plumbing, wall and floor mouldings, including
international contributions, rose from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 14m.
The international businesses, which in the first half generated sales of
Pounds 148.4m (Pounds 119.7m), accounted for just under half of group
turnover of Pounds 299.1m (Pounds 273.2m). Its contribution to operating
profits is much higher, following the recession in the UK construction
industry, and rose in the first half from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12.1m
including a Pounds 1.5m gain on currency movements.
Mr Trapnell said profits had risen strongly in the US, helped by an 8 per
cent increase in housing starts in southern states, and in New Zealand. A
strong German market for DIY products meant that profits grew marginally in
western Europe, despite sharply falling demand for construction products in
other continental European markets. Profits from South Africa fell slightly.
The chief executive said the group would be looking to expand its
international plastic products interests.
COMMENT
Having successfully reduced UK operating costs during the recession, Marley
finds itself well placed to take advantage of even a modest recovery in
housebuilding, as evidenced by its latest first half figures. Price
increases, provided they can be held, will improve margins further although
these may never recover to the peak levels reached previously. The US
housing recovery should continue to boost North American profits while there
is still no sign of any slackening in the group's German markets. The
balance sheet is not strong, but at the same time is under no great strain
with gearing of 64 per cent on net borrowings of Pounds 136.7m. Most of the
group's virtues, however, have been recognised already in the share price,
and a prospective multiple of more than 23 on full year pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 30m leaves little room for further improvement in the market
price.

FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Swithland to seek costs from Hoskins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITHLAND Estates, a private company run by Mr Adam Page, former chairman of
Midsummer Leisure, is to seek 'substantial costs' from Hoskins Brewery, the
Leicester-based real ale brewer.
The move follows eight months of abortive negotiations on a deal to inject
three of Swithland's Fatty Arbuckle theme bars into Hoskins in return for 41
per cent of the USM-quoted brewer's equity.
Mr Page said yesterday that Hoskins had ended the negotiations without
notice last Friday.
Mr Robert Hoar, a Hoskins director, had notified him that the company had
begun negotiations on a proposal from a third party.
In a statement on Monday, Mr Barrie Hoar, Hoskins' chairman, said that
negotiations with Swithland had been 'terminated for a variety of reasons
beyond the control of the company.'
However, Mr Page said: 'We do not believe there were any valid reasons for
not completing the transaction. We complied with all the requirements to
enable the deal to proceed - and we still believe it would be in the best
interests of Hoskins' shareholders.'
He claimed to have reached agreement to buy the Hoar family's 30 per cent
share-holding only the day before the negotiations were ended.

REED ELSEVIER, the international publishing group, said yesterday that it
was set to complete the purchase of Official Airline Guides, the former
Maxwell company, within the next two to three weeks.
In May, Reed signed a non-exclusive letter of intent to buy the business for
Dollars 425m (Pounds 285m) from Price Waterhouse, the joint administrator of
Maxwell Communication Corporation.
At this stage it is thought highly unlikely that another bidder will come
forward.
Mr Nicholas Jones, Reed deputy director corporate relations, said last night
that due diligence work would shortly be completed.
'We are now just waiting for the details to be pored over by the lawyers,'
he said.
Reed already owns ABC World Airways Guides, and has obtained US anti-trust
clearance to acquire OAG, which had operating profits of Dollars 44.5m last
year.
It believes that putting the two guides together will allow it to compete
better with the electronic systems operated by many airlines.
If the deal goes ahead, the acquisition will be by Reed Travel group, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Kodak to shed 10,000 more jobs

EASTMAN Kodak, the troubled photographic equipment company, expects to cut
about 10,000 jobs by the end of 1995, some 7.5 per cent of its workforce.
The forecast cuts are in addition to 2,000 job losses announced earlier this
year.
Kodak could not immediately comment on the number of redundancies expected
in the UK. The job cuts will mean bad news for Rochester, New York - a
company town near Lake Ontario. The forecast was made in a letter to
shareholders by Mr Kay Whitmore, Kodak's departing chairman.
Mr Whitmore, who has a reputation for disliking job cuts, was told to go as
the head of Kodak by independent directors earlier this month.
He is staying on until a replacement is chosen. When Mr Whitmore's impending
departure was announced, Kodak's directors said the company no longer
expected to unveil a 'turnround' plan in September. They added that Mr
Whitmore would write to shareholders after the August 13 board meeting.
Mr Whitmore wrote that Kodak's plans anticipate 'reducing capital spending
to the level of depreciation, capping both research and development and
sales, advertising, distribution, and administration, and pursuing
opportunities to turn assets into cash'.
Mr Whitmore did not elaborate on potential asset sales. Speculation has
centred on its health interests, dominated by Sterling Drug.
He said that should allow the company to generate cash flow - profits after
tax and interest, but with depreciation taken into account - of Dollars
2.8bn between the beginning of 1993, and the end of 1995. Cash flow should
reach Dollars 700m in 1993, Dollars 1bn in 1994 and Dollars 1.1bn in 1995.
The 1993 figure will include a contribution from the large Eastman Chemical
unit which Kodak has already said will be spun off.
Yesterday, Kodak said independent directors - who include Mr Roberto
Goizueta, chairman of Coca-Cola, and Mr John Phelan, former head of the New
York Stock Exchange - were 'pleased with some of the elements' of Mr
Whitmore's proposed restructuring.
On Wall Street, Kodak - which stood at Dollars 55 3/8 in advance of Mr
Whitmore's overthrow - gained another Dollars   1/4 to close at Dollars 60
1/2 .

FT  19 AUG 93 / Ted Turner expands empire into Hollywood film production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR TED TURNER, the creator of Cable News Network which has transformed
television news around the world, has finally satisfied his desire to expand
into Hollywood.
Mr Turner's Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System is to buy two
independent film studios, Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, for
Dollars 672m (Pounds 450m) in cash and shares. TBS will also assume roughly
Dollars 170m of the studios' debts.
The combination of the two successful studios gives Mr Turner, who is
married to the actress Jane Fonda, new muscle in the entertainment industry.
He will be able to produce and distribute top quality theatrical films as
well as stock his cable empire with fresh programming.
Castle Rock has produced hit films such as In the Line of Fire and A Few
Good Men. New Line, best known for its low-budget series Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles and Nightmare on Elm Street, has also produced films such as
Glengarry Glen Ross.
TBS has agreed to acquire privately-held Castle Rock for a reported Dollars
100m in cash plus the repayment of Dollars 46m of debt to Westinghouse
Electric, which owns 15 per cent of the studio, and Dollars 15m in debt to
Sony Pictures Entertainment, which holds 44 per cent.
Turner will also assume another Dollars 100m worth of debt, secured on
Castle Rock's future production. The remaining 41 per cent interest in
Castle Rock is divided among its five principals, including veteran
Hollywood executive Mr Alan Horn and the film director Mr Rob Reiner. Sony
will continue to distribute the studio's films until 1997.
The acquisition of New Line, a listed company, involves Dollars 511m worth
of Turner shares and the assumption of about Dollars 70m in debt. The
studio's founder and chairman, Mr Robert Shaye, who owns 27 per cent of the
company, stands to make a profit of more than Dollars 100m. Each of New
Line's 22m shares will be converted into 0.96 shares of Turner Class B
common stock. Based on Turner's closing price of Dollars 24.12 on Tuesday,
Turner will issue some 21m Class B shares for the merger.
Both deals were announced after the US market closed on Tuesday. Yesterday
Turner Class B shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 23. New Line's
shares rose Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 19 1/2 .

FT  19 AUG 93 / Barclays chooses chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS has chosen a new chief executive from outside the banking industry,
Sir Peter Middleton, the bank's deputy chairman, told banking analysts in
New York yesterday.
Analysts said that Sir Peter had told them that an announcement could be
made as early as today because the executive had already been offered the
job and agreed in principle. It now required only the formal agreement of
the two companies' boards.
Barclays is thought to have selected a British candidate to split the
responsibility of running the biggest UK bank with Mr Andrew Buxton, its
chairman. But analysts said Sir Peter did not disclose the executive's
nationality.
Speaking at an analysts' meeting following the bank's first-half results,
Sir Peter said that Barclays had interviewed executives from commercial and
investment banks, but had chosen an outsider with financial experience.
The appointment is the culmination of a four-month search. Mr Buxton
announced his decision to split his role as chair-man and chief executive
following pressure from large shareholders.
There has been speculation that Mr Charles Miller Smith, a director of
Unilever, was among the non-bankers shortlisted by Barclays with the help of
its headhunting firm Spencer Stuart. The bank said yesterday that it could
not comment.
If it cannot announce its choice today, the bank is thought likely to wait
until next week. However, Sir Peter said that Barclays had hoped to make an
announcement this week.
He said Barclays wanted the new chief executive to build up the bank's
central group function independently of its three operating divisions:
personal and corporate banking, the BZW investment bank, and service
businesses.
Sir Peter, who is also chairman of BZW, said the new chief executive would
be involved in Barclays' treasury function, the way in which it allocates
capital to operations, and the reform of its management of credit and other
risks.
Barclays returned to profit in the first half of this year with a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 335m following a full-year loss of Pounds 242m for 1992,
and the cutting of its dividend.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Japan braces itself for the US roadshow: Carmakers looking
to develop reciprocal inroads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent sale by Chrysler, one of the Big Three US carmakers, of its final
2.7 per cent stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors ended an equity link that
spanned more than two decades.
By coincidence, on the same day, the US Court of International Trade ruled
against a charge brought by US carmakers that Japanese manufacturers were
dumping mini-vans in the US market.
The relationship between US and Japanese carmakers has always been as much
coloured by politics as ruled by business interests. In the past, the
wrangling has centred on the US car market, with US makers calling on
politicians to curb the Japanese onslaught on their home territory. But now
the focus of political and business interest has been shifting from the US
to Japan.
A complex web of relationships has grown up between the Big Three and their
Japanese rivals. These gave US manufacturers smaller, fuel-efficient cars
and introduced them to Japanese-style manufacturing methods, while allowing
Japanese car companies a direct route into the US market.
The Japanese market was never a focus of these alliances - in 1992 imported
cars took only a 4.1 per cent share.
But changes in the political and business environment have wrought a shift
in roles. Now Japanese car executives sense a greater interest among US
manufacturers in penetrating the Japanese market, and worry that US
companies might be serious about using their corporate links to expand their
share.
'Ford is now serious about entering the Japanese market,' says Mr Yoshihiro
Wada, president of Mazda.
Although the US company has had a dealer network of 300 stores for more than
10 years, which Mazda set up to sell Ford cars, Ford was not particularly
enthusiastic about selling to the Japanese market, Mr Wada says.
That has changed. Ford recently announced that it would start supplying the
Japanese market with right-hand drive models, including the best-selling
Taurus, from next year. The US company is also setting up a technical centre
in Tokyo to help increase sales of its auto parts to Japanese carmakers.
General Motors, meanwhile, has been pushing Toyota to sell GM cars through
its dealer network.
In April, the US company said the two had agreed in principle to manufacture
a car in the US for the Japanese market, with Toyota handling the
distribution. The Japanese company says it is still considering the
proposal.
Many Japanese car companies acknowledge a debt to the US industry in helping
them realise their global ambitions.
'It is questionable whether Mitsubishi would have grown into the company it
now is without the tie-up with Chrysler,' says Mr Taizo Yokoyama, managing
director of Mitsubishi Motors which has been selling about 40 per cent of
its cars in the US through Chrysler's dealers.
Nissan says it was able to develop the Quest multi-purpose car because of
its tie-up with Ford. Both companies wanted a new multi-purpose vehicle but
independent development would have been too costly, says Mr Junji Shibata,
general manager of Nissan's European and North American operations group.
Japanese manufacturers have had to dissociate business interests from the
political pressures. For example, Ford, which has had a 24.5 per cent stake
in Mazda, joined GM and Chrysler in calling for anti-dumping duties on
Japanese mini-vans, including Mazda's MPV Wagon.
However, Mr Wada describes Ford as acting from political necessity, not from
a desire to cause Mazda difficulties. 'They are speaking on a political
level,' he says.
But as US companies step up their efforts to enter the Japanese market, the
sacrifices Japanese carmakers may have to make are overshadowing the
advantages they see in their links with US companies.
While the Japanese makers say they are willing to help US competitors in
their home market, they emphasise the need for clear business incentives for
such co-operation.
'We are considering selling Chrysler cars through our dealers,' says
Mitsubishi's Mr Yokoyama, 'but it depends on how competitive Chrysler's cars
will be in Japan.'
If they can do what the Japanese did in the US and provide domestic
manufacturers with cars that they lack, the possibilities for partnerships
would increase, Mr Yokoyama suggests.
Chrysler, for example, is riding high on a Japanese craze for four-wheel
drive cars and provides Honda with its Jeep Cherokee.
Meanwhile, with the yen's appreciation, buying US-made parts or finished
products may actually make good business sense for Japanese manufacturers.
But the consensus is that US carmakers still have some way to go in meeting
the needs of Japan's demanding consumers. Ford's enthusiasm about the
Japanese market 'does not mean it will have a car that will do well in Japan
this year or even next year', Mr Wada says.
With the US domestic car market in one of its worst post-war slumps and
protectionist calls hampering their advance overseas, Japanese carmakers
must be hoping their US partners prove to be slower students in the Japanese
market than they were many years ago in the US.

FT  19 AUG 93 / BICC falls as Europe suffers downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE deepening recession on the European continent adversely affected BICC,
the cables and construction group, which yesterday reported a 12 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits for the half-year to June 26.
Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said: 'In the last year, the continental
European economies in which we operate have deteriorated rapidly. The rate
of recovery in the UK and Australia has been disappointingly slow while the
upturn in North America is only stuttering along.'
Profits fell from Pounds 58m to Pounds 51m on higher sales of Pounds 1.95bn
(from Pounds 1.77bn). The shares fell 14p to 403p. Around Pounds 4m of the
fall in profits was due to the decision not to capitalise interest on
property developments.
The rest of the decline was mainly attributable to BICC Cables, the European
business, where profits fell from Pounds 47m to Pounds 36m. It closed two
factories at its loss-making operations in Spain and cut the workforce 22
per cent. This compares with a 20 per cent staff cut in the UK and 25 per
cent in the US.
Profits from the Italian and Portuguese operations also fell while the cable
business in Germany broke even.
North American cables reported a loss of Pounds 3m compared with a profit of
Pounds 1m. A rationalisation programme in Canada is expected to yield annual
savings of CDollars 10m (Pounds 5m). Australasia reported increased profits
of Pounds 20m (from Pounds 13m) through increasing volumes and benefiting
from a lower cost base.
Balfour Beatty, the contractor, increased operating profits to Pounds 17m
(from Pounds 15m). Sir Robin was encouraged by the increasing number of UK
infrastructure projects involving the private sector but urged the
government not to cut capital spending as way of bringing public spending
under control.
Sir Robin said offers, although inadequate, for part of the group's property
portfolio, indicated the first 'chink of light' in the depressed property
sector.
Borrowings rose to Pounds 151m, partly because of acquisitions and
disposals, giving gearing of 20 per cent. The interest charge was Pounds 16m
(from Pounds 17m). Last year debt was wiped out from the proceeds of a
rights issue. Earnings per share fell to 8.2p (from 11.2p). The interim
dividend is held at 6p.

FT  19 AUG 93 / British Gas to expand abroad if MMC proposals adopted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS intends to expand its overseas operations and concentrate more
of its investment abroad if the recommendations made by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission on Tuesday are adopted by the government, the company
said yesterday.
The commission proposed in two wide-ranging reports that British Gas lose
its monopoly over household supply by 2002. It also recommended the sale of
the company's trading arm by 1997 to encourage competition.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said: 'With the sale of the trading arm,
we will no longer have the opportunity to grow in the UK gas market
directly. From the point of view of growth of the company, that puts more
focus on our overseas activities.'
He said the company had already placed a great emphasis on expanding
overseas. Its opportunities to invest in the UK would be curtailed with the
loss of the trading arm - which sells gas to households and industrial
customers.
British Gas acknowledged that there were many opportunities for expansion
worldwide. But its overseas expansion programme, which has seen the company
pay Pounds 1.5bn to build its Global Gas division since privatisation, has
been widely criticised in the City as lacking focus.
'So far Global Gas has a portfolio of various businesses around the world
which hasn't added up to anything meaningful,' said Ms Irene Himona,
industry analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. The company is
conducting a review of its Global Gas operations as a way of giving them
more focus in the company.
British Gas's overseas businesses are concentrated in its exploration and
production division, which also includes interests in the North Sea, and its
Global Gas unit which buys into overseas gas markets. The company said
several years ago that it aimed to earn 60 per cent of its profits from
these divisions by the end of the decade.
Mr Brown said these targets were no longer relevant, since a higher
proportion was likely to come from overseas activities in future. These two
divisions helped make up for a drop in profits from UK gas supply last year,
when they contributed Pounds 361m to profits compared with Pounds 1.2bn for
UK gas supply.
Mr Paul Spedding, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the overseas business
held the key to growth at British Gas. He expected it to generate income of
Pounds 450m by 1997.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Monetary union 'still on course': Bundesbank says new ERM
margins need not disrupt integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK said yesterday that the new wide margins of fluctuation
within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System need not
disrupt the process of monetary integration in Europe.
The German central bank said the second stage of European monetary union
would still come into force by next January 1, in line with the Maastricht
treaty.
It left uncertain, however, the future timetable towards a single currency,
saying 'the further steps on the road to economic and monetary union will .
. . hinge crucially on whether, and how soon, the economic and political
prerequisites for a common currency can be fulfilled'.
In a staunch defence of its own actions, published in its latest monthly
bulletin, the Bundesbank said its credibility had been 'hardened' by its
proven independence, and its absolute priority for an anti-inflationary
monetary policy, in recent weeks.
The article gave no hint of remorse for the stern monetary policy which
precipitated the latest ERM crisis.
It said the system had become vulnerable to massive speculation because the
limits to exchange rate stabilisation had become clear.
The Bundesbank bought EMS partner currencies equivalent to almost DM60bn
(Dollars 34.80bn) in July - mostly French francs. Purchases on July 30, when
the Danish krone also fell to its lower intervention point, totalled almost
DM30bn.
While it agreed that the new broad currency bands in the ERM would offer
Germany's EC partners greater latitude for a monetary policy independent of
its own, the bank warned they must 'exploit this monetary policy scope with
circum-spection'.
From an all-European point of view, the temporary widening of the margins of
fluctuation in the EMS is not to be regarded as a relapse into less orderly
monetary conditions.
'As long as member states' monetary policy makers abide by the medium-term
objectives for price stability, and neither succumb to the temptation of
economic policy hyperactivity, nor aim at gaining short-term competitive
advantages, the preconditions for exchange rate stability remain in place.
'By the latest monetary policy measures, the authorities have succeeded in
preserving in principle the rules of the EMS. Owing to the greater
flexibility in the operation of these rules, potential tensions have been
lessened at the same time, and thus a major contribution has been made to
containing intervention volumes.'
The analysis of the ERM crisis puts the long-term blame on the premature
effort to operate a system of unchanged parities.

FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK water sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With next year's regulatory review looming, water companies can draw mild
encouragement from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on British
Gas. The rate of return on new investment recommended by the MMC is around 1
percentage point higher than that suggested by the water industry regulator.
Water companies will be loath to risk a direct appeal to the MMC, but its
findings set a precedent. Capital expenditure may run at Pounds 5bn a year
through the second half of the decade, so a 1 percentage point increase in
rate of return adds Pounds 50m a year to profits. Existing assets may also
earn more.
The snag is that the MMC's findings might strengthen the argument that water
companies have made excessive returns on capital since privatisation. As the
MMC recognised, valuing the capital base of utilities is no easy matter.
Ofwat's favoured approach is to take the market capitalisation of the water
sector at privatisation as a measure of historic assets, to which new
investment is added. On that basis - and applying the MMC's rates of return
for gas - the water sector should be making annual profits of perhaps Pounds
800m. Last year, profits amounted to well over Pounds 1bn.
The question is whether Ofwat will try to claw back what it might argue are
excess profits by allowing lower rates of return in future. The comfort for
shareholders is that such action would have to be gradual. Water companies'
ability to service the huge amounts of capital needed to fund investment
would otherwise be damaged. On that basis, there seems little to disturb the
recent rally in the sector. As in the case of other utilities, investors'
enthusiasm for shares which yield more than the market average is proving a
match for regulatory doubts.

FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: SCA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a paper company to contemplate increasing capacity again is a real act
of faith that the market has turned. Swedish investors clearly believe as
much, having bid up their paper sector by 1.3 times since last October. But
the signs are not all positive and it will take time to soak up current
overcapacity. Significantly, SCA's new machine in the UK will not come on
stream until 1995. The company's move may also reflect structural
considerations as much as cyclical ones, as Nordic producers shut capacity
in home markets and open mills using recycled pulp closer to end users.
Timing paper cycles is certainly tricky, as Fletcher Challenge - which
yesterday wrote down the carrying value of UK Paper by NZDollars 229m - will
doubtless confirm. Hence SCA's caution in considering sharing the project
with South African investors. They, in turn, may have the additional
temptation of parking funds offshore. But if things really are turning the
paper industry's way, this may be dispiriting news for others. UK newspapers
have benefited greatly from the 30 per cent fall in newsprint prices since
1989. If that trend reverses itself, advertising revenues remain sticky and
the spectre of VAT materialises, newspapers' margins could be painfully
squeezed.

FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: BICC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market's euphoria could scarcely have contrasted more with
the dour faces on display at BICC. Although there was an encouraging 54 per
cent profits recovery in Australasia and an improving trend in the UK, BICC
was consumed by the gloom surrounding lengthening recession in mainland
Europe. Germany was particularly weak. Cable volumes in Spain fell 30 per
cent. If, as seems probable, BICC's experience has broader implications for
UK manufacturers, it was entirely lost on the overall market yesterday.
Despite the 3 per cent fall after its figures, BICC's shares have still
climbed 95 per cent from last October's trough. The theory is that even if
trading remains grim, BICC's shares are underpinned by the yield, which
remains at 6 per cent. But that presupposes that the dividend will be held.
After the 27 per cent fall in interim earnings, this may be open to doubt.
BICC has previously dipped into reserves to maintain its payment. Its
earnings may barely cover the dividend this year too. BICC would then face
the agonising dilemma of deciding whether to persevere with its pay-out
policy or preserve cash to fund expansion. At this stage in the cycle,
investors may have assumed such worries were redundant. But a further
downward lurch in BICC's European markets may make them all too real.
Chasing yield may be the latest fashion. But it is worth keeping an eye on
earnings too.

FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: High on yield
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 48-point rise in the FT-SE 100 index at the end of a record 18 consecutive
rises and one flat day suggests a degree of hysteria about UK equities.
Certainly there were some special factors in London yesterday, not least
overseas investors buying from market makers who were chronically short of
stock. Yet with eight different equity markets hitting all-time or 1993
peaks yesterday, there is more going on. Sharply reduced worldwide inflation
expectations, low and falling short term interest rates and a consequent
fall in real bond yields have encouraged investors to overlook historically
low equity yields.
The 35 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 - and a 70 per cent rise in small cap
stocks - since sterling left the ERM argues for caution, but there is some
support from bonds for the current market valuation. If inflation remains
subdued, yield is a good yardstick for assessing market valuations. With
bond yields around 7.5 per cent and equities yielding 3.7 per cent, the
yield ratio is hardly stretched. Comparison with overseas markets is also
encouraging. The reward for holding equities as opposed to bonds is still
substantially higher for UK shares than many overseas markets - notably the
US.
Such considerations are doubtless driving the move away from highly rated
cyclical shares, which have already more than discounted economic recovery,
towards larger companies with solid dividend yields. Still, nervous
investors must be wondering how low absolute equity yields can fall. That in
part depends on how sustained the remission in inflation proves. Both the
monetary aggregates and the yawning output gap suggest that any inflationary
threat is some way off.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Beefing up the SIB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE regulation of retail financial services, Britain's Securities and
Investments Board has been given a clear and demanding blueprint, courtesy
of the Treasury, on where to go next. Yet in the wider securities area there
is considerable discontent over the workings of the 1986 Financial Services
Act, without any general agreement on the remedies that are needed to
address the flaws in the system exposed by Polly Peck, Blue Arrow, Guinness
and others. Some clues as to the likely evolution of the regulatory
structure are nonetheless beginning to emerge, notably from the stock
exchange and the SIB itself. They involve a degree of centralisation, based
on an enlarged role for the SIB, that may well ruffle the odd feather in the
City and Whitehall.
The first plank in the argument for an enlarged role for the SIB is that
surveillance of market malpractice is hobbled from the outset if it is
carried out by different agencies. The initial steps towards countering many
forms of market malpractice, for example, lie in identifying suspicious
trading patterns. But different regulators are monitoring trading
information across a range of markets open to the insider dealer, including
formal derivative markets such as Liffe, over-the-counter markets, so-called
non-markets such as Reuters' Instinet dealing system, as well as the stock
exchange itself. In that fragmented market environment, a centralised
approach to monitoring data, supplemented by whatever additional information
is available under existing international agreements, would clearly be more
effective.
Investigatory process
Equally compelling is the case for a more coherent investigatory process. In
most insider dealing cases, the initial work is undertaken by the stock
exchange. Evidence is then passed on to the Department of Trade and
Industry, which in turn makes a decision on whether to shunt the paper in
the direction of the Crown Prosecution Service.
Small wonder that so many probes into suspicious trading activity before
takeover bids start with a bang and end in a whimper. In the absence of a
single authority with responsibility for seeing the investigation through
from beginning to end, impetus is lost.
Investigations are not helped by the fact that the powers of the stock
exchange to interrogate and demand documents are inadequate, especially in
relation to people outside the financial services sector. Those of the DTI,
meantime, are extensive but expensive. While the powers and resources to
address wrongdoing exist, they are unevenly distributed around the system.
Prosecution powers
The final area in which both the SIB and stock exchange share common ground
relates to prosecution. Here the options are too narrowly polarised between
the regulatory sanctions available to the SIB and the self-regulatory
bodies, and the criminal law. The SIB is already moving further into the
middle ground by preparing to deploy the hitherto unused sanction in Section
59 of the Financial Services Act, which permits it to disqualify people from
the financial services industry. Yet it could also be argued that the
protracted proceedings and unsatisfactory outcomes in the highly technical
Guinness and Blue Arrow affairs might well have been avoided if there had
been an alternative to blanket resort to criminal law, with its onerous
requirements in relation to proof.
It is striking that one of the main differences between the US Securities
and Exchange Commission and the SIB lies in the ability of the US agency to
mount civil actions. The question is whether some form of US-style plea
bargaining could provide a filtering mechanism to ensure that only those
misdeeds with a strong chance of resulting in successful prosecution find
their way into the criminal courts. A wider range of civil options might
then be made available to the SIB.
Expanding the powers of the SIB in this way would make for more effective
enforcement. But there are questions of cost. Fewer headlines about botched
prosecutions involving City institutions might, at a pinch, be an acceptable
trade-off to practitioners. The more important question, to which time alone
holds the answer, is whether an enlarged SIB would deliver on its promise to
perform.

FT  19 AUG 93 / An ill wind of change: Wind power is uneconomic,
environmentally intrusive and unnecessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this month Mr John Gummer, the UK environment secretary, overturned
the decision of a local council in Cornwall, south-west England, and
authorised the construction of a wind farm at Four Burrows near Truro.
Many people will support his action. Mr Gummer can override local opposition
to projects of national interest if he wants to, and wind power has clearly
won a place in this government's, if not the nation's, heart.
But this is rather disturbing. It is not the first time that a UK secretary
of state has pushed through a wind farm against the wishes of people who
have to live nearby. In fact, it is the fourth. In addition, two more
projects have been referred to Mr Gummer, and a further six are on appeal
after having been turned down by local councils.
Why is wind power being thrust upon the country in this way when it is
uneconomic, environmentally intrusive and, worse still, quite unnecessary?
I must disclose an interest. I spend a lot of time in the Duddon estuary in
south Cumbria where Mr Michael Heseltine, an earlier environment secretary,
bulldozed through another wind farm a couple of years ago. Two wind farms
now mar this beautiful stretch of countryside on the borders of the Lake
District, producing elect-ricity which the country does not need.
I have learnt in the course of many conversations about wind farms that this
is not a subject for rational discourse. People either feel good about them
because they are clean and green, or they object to the way they spoil the
landscape. The economic case seldom comes into it.
I don't want to waste time attacking the visual aspects of wind farms
because I accept that some people see beauty in clusters of 100-foot white
propellers twirling in the wind. Nor will I dwell on noise objections
because the evidence is clearly mixed. But I do want to question the
commercial case, on several grounds.
The first is cost. What few people realise is that wind power technology is
a very long way from commercial operation. It costs as much as 12p to
produce a kilowatt hour of wind power compared to the 2.5p-3p that
electricity fetches on the UK wholesale market, and the 8p that households
pay for it. The difference has to be made up through a special levy on
customers' bills. This is not itemised so most people do not even realise
that they are paying it. To date, wind power has received some Pounds 5m in
customer subsidies, and this is due to be increased as the next round of
subsidised projects is approved.
The second is that Britain has an abundance of power generation capacity,
and the last thing it needs is additional uneconomic plant. Capacity
currently exceeds demand by about 30 per cent, which is one reason why coal
miners are being thrown out of work.
The third is that wind does not supply predictable amounts of power when we
need it. It is subject to the vagaries of the weather; it cannot be switched
on at 5pm to cook the evening meal, yet if a gale blows at 4am, the power it
generates is wasted.
The fourth is that Britain is unusually well endowed with fuel sources
(coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro), so there is no case for arguing that wind
power is necessary for a diversity of supply.
The last is that even if it is wise on environmental or other grounds to
explore alternative energy sources, the fact is that wind can only make a
tiny contribution. According to the government's advisory group on
alternative energy, wind could supply a maximum 10 per cent of the country's
needs. But to achieve this we would have to build 38,000 windmills on 4,000
square kilometers of land, and transform all our exposed hillsides into
whirligigs.
We should be clear why the government is trying to push through such a
nonsensical plan. It is not out of any belief in its commercial value,
because there is none. It cannot be in furtherance of a utopian vision of a
land free of fuel-burning power stations, because that will never happen. It
is not even in support of British technology, since most of the equipment
used is imported.
The truth is that the government is exploiting widespread ignorance about
the true cost and potential of wind power to strengthen its own rather
doubtful green credentials. It is managing to get away with it because the
debate about wind power is so soggy.
All of which is very bizarre for a government so strongly committed to the
free market and the elimination of subsidy. If British Coal is being forced
to lop off an arm and a limb to stay alive, why are we handing wind power a
crutch?

FT  19 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Valuing the environment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PUTTING VALUES on the environment tends to be controversial. Many
non-economists find it offensive, feeling that clean air and water,
rainforests and whales are priceless. This position is absurd. The exercise
of working out what we are prepared to pay or forego to preserve the
environment is necessary. It is necessary if public debate is to be
informed. It is necessary if governments are to weigh up the cost of
cleaning up the environment against the benefits. It is also necessary if
economically efficient policies are to be adopted.
What is more, attributing values often helps rather than hinders the
environmental cause. Discharging pollution into the atmosphere or the oceans
often appears free, for example, because there is no market in these
'goods'. They are 'externalities', consequences not taken into account by
decision makers. As a result, environmental resources tend to be overused,
which is why environmentalists should welcome serious attempts at costing
the earth.
Misleading terminology has been responsible for much opposition to
environmental valuation. The exercise is one of putting values on people's
preferences for preserving the environment, not searching for values
intrinsic to the natural world itself.
People's desire
The value of protecting the environment can be derived partly from the use
people actually make of resources and the damage that, say, global warming
would do to crop yields. The valuation is also likely to include an
'existence' portion, which represents people's desire for the trees or the
whales to be there, even if they do not make direct use of them.
Preservation of the Grand Canyon ranks high in US studies of such
preferences, for example, even though many citizens never visit it.
An 'option' value for the potential use of some resources may also be
included: people hope that tropical jungles may eventually yield new
medicines. The derivation of such values is inevitably rough and ready. It
is far better, however, to be roughly right, by making these calculations,
than precisely wrong, by ignoring the need to do so.
The OECD reported last year that governments of its member countries were
increasingly using such techniques in policymaking. But with the exception
of the US's Environmental Protection Agency, adoption of such analysis has
been patchy and tentative.
OECD reports detect a 'credibility problem' and attribute it to two unsolved
controversies. The first is how future costs and benefits should be
discounted because they do not occur for many years.
Future generations
Many environmentalists oppose the notion of discounting, on the grounds that
it under-represents the interests of future generations who must, for
example, pay for decommissioning nuclear power stations. But that argument
ignores the opportunity cost of the investment, which could be spent on
research, education or infrastructure - a clean environment is only one of
many benefits handed on to future generations.
Present modes of analysis also do not take adequate account of uncertainty.
Scientists disagree, for example, about the likelihood and the extent of
global warming. Nor do these methods reflect people's tolerance for higher
risks where they have some control, such as driving a car, than where they
have none, such as from a nuclear power station.
Those points need clearer treatment. So do even more ambitious plans for
environmental valuation, such as bringing 'green' values into the national
accounts to reflect gains or losses to a country's 'environmental capital'.
Despite those unsettled questions, economic analysis can help clarify which
policies should be followed. Economic instruments, such as taxes and permits
for pollution, can then bring the costs of cleaning up the environment into
the open, whereas regulation tends to leave them hidden. But neither solves
the political problem of enforcing the best policies if they prove unpopular
 -as the energy taxes proposed by the US, UK and European Community are
proving. If the analysis is carried out systematically, however, governments
cannot claim ignorance of what they are sacrificing.

history. It is also likely to be the biggest challenge in AT&amp;T's history.
Nobody doubts that Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's naturally cautious chairman, is
right to see mobile communications as 'absolutely central' to his industry's
future. The question is: how central and how soon?
It is tempting to look back for inspiration. Early railways provided local
connections to canals; the first car buyers in the US were farmers shifting
their produce to rail. As for the telephone, it was seen originally as an
access system for the telegraph. Western Union, the world's largest
telegraph service, spurned the offer to buy Alexander Graham Bell's
telephone patents for Dollars 100,000, and rued the day ever after.
As Mr Robin Meakin, mobile communications analyst at CIT Research, the
London-based consultancy, puts it: 'In cellular communications, we have seen
many of the same arguments about technological redundancy rehearsed, and
many of the same business plans discussed.'
The analogies apply up to a point. It is no coincidence that few of the more
imaginative and aggressive marketers of mobile communications have been the
traditional fixed-wire operators. McCaw, for all its financial vicissitudes,
was a trailblazer in the US; companies such as Vodafone, Mannesmann and
Hutchison were prime movers in Europe.
It is also true that the technology is now at hand for cellular
communications to compete head-to-head with fixed-wire companies for the
first time. New digital cellular networks currently coming on stream in the
US and Europe are enhancing capacity and quality. The regulatory and
competitive structure is in place too: rival companies are licensed across
the US, and most European governments have licensed - or soon will -
competing operators to provide a digital service to the pan-European GSM
standard.
Even where telecommunications operators still have a legal monopoly, efforts
are being made to give mobile services a separate, competing identity.
Belgacom, the Belgium monopoly, last month hived off its unit to build a
digital GSM network into a separate division, and invited Pacific Telesis
(Pactel), the US operator, to join as a 25 per cent strategic partner.
By the same token, in the US the 'Baby Bell' regional companies believe the
McCaw takeover is a regressive step. They have responded angrily, arguing
that the move will allow AT&amp;T to re-enter the local market from which it was
evicted at the break-up of the old Bell company in 1984. Pactel, a Baby Bell
which is also one of the top five US cellular operators, yesterday
reportedly claimed: 'AT&amp;T is going to roll over everybody on the highway; it
is on an orgy of reintegration.'
The reality is unlikely to be as simple as that. For the foreseeable future,
cellular and other wire-less technology will complement, not replace, the
fixed wire. It is not another railway displacing the canal - a mode of
transport which had virtually no advantage, or potential for development,
over the steam engine on tracks. It is more like the car, the train and the
aeroplane coexisting in tension - the three appealing to distinct, but
related and overlapping markets, each developing new strengths.
The fixed-wire has two key, continuing strengths. It is far cheaper than
wire-less technologies yet developed. And what it loses in mobility it gains
in capacity.
Prices are still going up in parts of the cellular industry. Handsets for
digital cellular services are at least double the price of their analogue
counterparts - and 10 or more times the cost of fixed-wire handsets.
As for call tariffs, serious competition has only recently begun to bring
down cellular prices significantly. As it does so, fixed-wire tariffs are
falling sharply. In the UK, the imminent launch of Mercury's PCN 'One-2-One'
network is pushing Vodafone and Cellnet to cut tariffs. But standard
business tariffs for the London area are still double or more BT's peak rate
tariff; and for most calls made in the afternoon the premium is far higher.
In the US, charges are generally lower, although they vary greatly between
the 700-plus cellular operating regions. To take Southwestern Bell in
Dallas, the basic package comes at 38 cents a minute for the first 200
minutes after a Dollars 49.95 access charge. The local peak call rate on the
fixed network is 24 cents a minute, which Southwestern cannot beat even for
its heaviest users.
While price competitive wire-less local networks are some way off, the
introduction of fibre into the 'fixed' local network is set to bring a wide
range of broadband, multimedia services to businesses and households that
mobile systems will be unable to match. Vice-President Al Gore's 'super
highway' is already under construction: in the US and much of Europe, even
many medium-sized businesses now have their own fibre connections, and the
laying of fibre across local exchanges is not far off.
Discarding simplistic notions of wireless networks 'replacing' the fixed
wire does not, however, dampen mobile's prospects. Rather, it highlights the
importance of the industry developing new markets and innovative
relationships between different, complementary technologies.
The room for complementary growth remains vast. Since 1984 the US market has
grown from about 1m to 12m subscribers. The Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association estimates that the top 11 US cellular providers added
627,580 subscribers in the first quarter of 1993, compared with 481,670 in
the same period of 1992, and there is no sign of growth tailing off.
Europe now has more than 6m subscribers - double the tally three years ago.
In the UK alone, Vodafone and Cellnet have added more than 250,000 customers
so far this year.
All the signs are that the industry is starting to penetrate the mass
consumer market. A detailed analysis of the US subscriber base by Economic
and Management Consultants International, a Washington-based group, suggests
that personal use of cellular phones rivalled business use by the end of
1992, and is now growing far more quickly. EMCI's five-year projections for
the US cellular subscriber market give 14.4m subscribers by the end of this
year, 17.7m by the end of 1995 and 25m by the end of 1996.
Such projections are necessarily little more than 'guesstimates', given the
data from which they project. And the scare about possible brain cancer
links to mobile phone use which swept the US earlier this year underlines
the youth of the industry and its susceptibility to swipes from unexpected
directions. But the trend is unmistakable.
What does this mean for AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn gamble? First, upward curves are
not enough. The trends, and McCaw's existing capacity to exploit them, are
more than reflected in the purchase price, so sitting on the wave will not
yield much of a real return. AT&amp;T may fashion a new key to unlock the market
faster. For instance, a report last year by the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, concluded that the current duopoly
arrangement in place in most areas was 'unlikely to provide a product at a
competitively set price'. The field is open for someone to prove it wrong.
However, the greatest challenge and opportunity for AT&amp;T is to exploit
wire-less services as an extension of its existing portfolio. As Mr Meakin
of CIT puts it: 'In future, real commercial success will lie in providing as
many types of local access technologies as possible - in being a truly
technology-independent local access provider.'
AT&amp;T has two clear qualifications for achieving that goal. Its existing
marketing and research strength - the Bell laboratories invented cellular in
the first place - make it well-placed to integrate wire-less with its other
services, offering businesses and consumers single billing arrangements,
personal numbering, attractive 'one-stop' packages including mobile and
fixed-link long-distance facilities, and so on.
Second, lacking a local network, AT&amp;T will be largely unconstrained by the
fear of competing against itself in developing the local market. Whatever
the reality, that fear has proved a notable constraint for many operators.
There is, however, a critical assumption behind the latter point: that the
existing regulatory structure which bans the Baby Bells from fixed-link
long-distance operations and AT&amp;T from local networks stays intact. The
structure, established in 1984, is under fierce assault, and AT&amp;T's McCaw
deal is another hammer blow. If the edifice crumbles and a free-for-all is
the result, today's map will be no guide to the future.

The unseemly row between the British and Norwegian environment ministers,
sparked off by Thorbjoern Berntsen's unfortunate outburst, reminded a reader
in Warsaw of an old joke about a man who received 25 years' imprisonment for
describing the first secretary of the Communist party as an 'uneducated
psychopath' - five years for slandering a high state official, and 20 years
for revealing state secrets.

Having done his bit to help sort out the Gatt chaos, Arthur Dunkel could
have been expected to put his expertise to good use on the boards of one or
two companies in his native Switzerland.
But it seems that he did the Gatt members a bigger favour than they probably
realise by agreeing to extend his term by an extra six months while they
searched for his successor. The big Swiss companies hold their AGMs - at
which new board members are approved - in the first half of the year.
So Dunkel, who made way for Peter Sutherland at the end of June, may have to
kill time before he can join SMH, maker of the Swatch - one of several
companies said to be keen to have him on board. In the meantime, he is
keeping his hand in lecturing at Geneva University and chairing the School
of Arts in Lausanne.

Good news and bad news for Mercedes and Toyota drivers. According to the
RAC's experts, called by 99,298 people who lost their car keys last year,
the S Class Mercedes and Toyota Lexus were the most difficult to break into.
Slightly exasperated proof of this fact is Alan Marsh, Inchcape director and
chairman of Lexus UK to boot. Although the Japanese manufacturer had
thoughtfully provided him with three sets of keys, Marsh managed to lock
himself out of his car at Birmingham Airport.
He called the RAC, which in turn called out a local specialist locksmith.
Despite having watched a confidential training video on how to enter the
Lexus, he gave up after three hours of fruitless struggle leaving Marsh with
the onerous task of convincing the local Lexus agent that he was indeed the
rightful owner.

Whatever else one might think about Lord Goodman, Britain's best known
solicitor, it should never be said that he doesn't give value for money.
Tucked away in his memoirs (reviewed on the opposite page) is an anecdote
about one of the three Boulting brothers, better known as Peter Cotes. Lord
Goodman recounts how Cotes went to see him in 1952 to complain about being
offered a meagre Pounds 100 to direct a play in the West End which he said
was bound to flop. The alternative was to accept 1 1/2 per cent of the
box-office takings. Even in your impoverished state, advised Goodman, Pounds
100 is no great sum of money. It would be better to take a sporting risk on
the box office.
The play is still running and is called The Mousetrap.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Observer: Developing speculation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that the Bank of France governor Jacques de Larosiere has secured the
presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the
rumour-mongers are turning their attention to a much bigger subject - the
presidency of the World Bank, the grandaddy of the development banking
world.
The speculation has been prompted by concern about the health of former J P
Morgan boss Lewis Preston, 67, who moved to the World Bank a couple of years
ago. He is still expected to return after convalescing from coronary bypass
surgery. But this has not stopped much tongue-wagging about who might get
the job if it was up for grabs again.
Though it may seem odd, tradition has it that the job goes to an American.
Preston was appointed by a Republican president, so Clinton would probably
want a Democrat in place.
The favourite on the Washington cocktail party circuit is Paul Volcker, the
former Federal Reserve chairman. He is two years younger than Preston and
was in the running last time. The downside is that he is probably nowhere
near as rich as Preston, so might not be willing to take a pay cut in order
to serve his country yet again.
A couple of other names being bandied around are Lazard Freres' Felix
Rohatyn and Robert Rubin, director of the White House economic council. Both
are old Wall Street hands and know their way around the capital markets, if
not the developing world.
However, ex-President Jimmy Carter's name has also been mentioned. He is a
Democrat and has taken a strong interest in development issues since he left
the White House. But he turns 69 in October. A more enterprising suggestion
is that General Colin Powell, who is about to retire as chairman of the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff, might be the man to attack the World Bank's
management structure. After all, he has already run the Pentagon, possibly
the only organisation with a bureaucracy more Byzantine than the World
Bank's. And thanks to Jacques Attali's brief time at the EBRD, the job is
now much better paid.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Taxman - stay thy grasping hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one figure about the British economy which every schoolboy
knows, it is that the public sector expects to borrow Pounds 50bn in
1993-94. Since the start of the financial year there have been good and bad
months; and the new estimate of Pounds 46bn of the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research lies within the same ballpark.
Bill Robinson, former special adviser to Norman Lamont, the ex-chancellor,
has explained, in a fascinating series of articles in the FT, the origins of
the deficit problem; but I am much less sure of his conclusion that tax
rates need to be raised further and interest rates reduced.
We may have to come round to this combination if other countries cut
interest rates so much that sterling threatens to rise to uncompetitive
levels. This has not happened yet; and sterling has retained some
four-fifths of its effective devaluation since its departure from the
exchange rate mechanism last September. There was never a realistic chance
of retaining the whole of it indefinitely anyway.
But as the new August NIESR Review points out, the independent fiscal case
for tax increases has been much exaggerated. It is almost forgotten that Mr
Lamont has already left behind some Pounds 10bn of tax increases, nearly all
of them to be phased in over the next two financial years. The NIESR assumes
for forecasting purposes that the chancellor announces another Pounds 2 1/2
bn of tax increases in his November Budget to show he is taking the fiscal
balance seriously.
It is human nature to project the present indefinitely, and to disbelieve
that the public sector borrowing requirement will ever come down without
drastic hair-shirt measures.
The NIESR does not dispute that the present level of the PSBR, which
corresponds to 7 per cent of gross domestic product, is unsustainably high.
The main NIESR point, however, is that on the basis of tax and spending
measures already taken or announced, the PSBR will fall sharply and
'stabilise at below 2 1/2 per cent of GDP towards the end of the decade'.
Most of the improvement is expected in the next couple of years. Whatever
financial and economic writers may say, the financial markets, judging by
the rise in gilts, do not share the scepticism of these commentators.
According to the last Budget Red Book, taxes (including National Insurance
Contributions) are expected to climb from a recession low of 34 1/2 per cent
of GDP this year to 37 per cent in 1997-98. This would not be quite as high
as the 38 per cent reached in the mid-1980s; but it would be much higher
than anything achieved, except fleetingly, under any previous government,
Labour or Conservative. There was no such rise in the tax-take during
recovery periods in earlier cycles.
On this basis the public sector debt ratio (gross debt as a proportion of
GDP), should stabilise around next year at a little below 50 per cent of
GDP. This ratio, which is sometimes called the solvency ratio, is within the
Maastricht guidelines, comparable to that of the early 1980s and much lower
than anything experienced in earlier decades. Do we then really need to
ratchet up the tax-take even further? The moral I draw is the need to stick
to present plans against pressures from the spending lobbies rather than for
draconian new measures out of a misplaced desire for the government to show
'leadership'.
The NIESR Review contains an analysis by Nigel Pain and others, which
represents a more sophisticated attempt to put UK public sector borrowing
into perspective than any I have yet seen. One of the most interesting of
his charts compares the PSBR with the net capital spending of the public
sector (net of receipts, not net of depreciation). In every year until 1991
the PSBR was less than net capital outlays, as the new current and capital
breakdown promised for the next Budget will doubtless confirm. So the public
sector obeyed what is sometimes called the 'golden rule': only borrow to
finance capital outlays.
Admittedly the present borrowing requirement of 7 per cent of GDP is now so
high that the 'golden rule' has been well broken. But on NIESR projections
it will be observed again from about 1995 onwards.
Of course, if even the modest recovery now generally foreseen fails to take
place, all bets are off and that includes all golden rules. The main aim of
policy would then be to get the economy back on something as near to a
normal growth trend as possible; and monetary and fiscal policy would have
to be subordinated to that end.
The most uncomfortable aspect of the public finances in the NIESR analysis
is shown by yet another ratio: that of public sector debt to public sector
capital, which the authors call 'gearing'. This is expected to level off in
the mid-1990s at a higher level than it has been at any time since the
1960s. The change reflects mostly developments on the assets side, such as
the fall in value of North Sea reserves, privatisation and council house
sales.
If one tries to work with too many ratios at the same time, however, the
result will be giddiness. It is best to concentrate on the PSBR ratio and
the solvency ratio. The high gearing of the public sector should be taken as
a hint to improve the public sector's balance when an opportunity occurs
rather than as an imperative for immediate action.
Admittedly, the advocate of fiscal stringency can point not only to the
gearing ratio, but also to the uncertainty of all PSBR projections and,
above all, the lack of any room for absorbing a shock, as arguments for the
chancellor to have a margin in hand.
One opposing argument is that the recovery is not yet so certain and so
strong that the government can take risks with measures which reduce
taxpayers' spending power. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated
that measures already announced in the last Budget will cost householders
some 2 per cent of annual income by the time they are fully implemented in
1995. The measures have probably been already taken into rough account in
people's spending plans. To go beyond these would risk denting confidence at
a sensitive time; and it would be folly to reckon in advance on offsetting
fiscal tightening by monetary relaxation or sterling falling.
Moreover, the most widely canvassed tax increases, in value added and other
consumer taxes, would have a knock-on effect on the headline inflation rate
 -which will in in any case be tending to rise in the coming months and thus
risk destroying the new, and still very fragile, non-inflationary
psychology.
But above all, the reason why I would part company from many in the economic
fraternity is the relentless rise in the tax-take in successive decades from
the 1950s onwards. The 1980s were the first decade in which this ratio
stabilised, although it did not decline. It would be better to wait for an
opportunity to act on the public spending side in the review now taking
place for the later years of the decade, rather than rush into
ill-considered tax increases which may have adverse supply side effects,
nonetheless real even though difficult to quantify in forecasting models.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Monetary union possible now
Maastricht is dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WILLEM H BUITER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The ratification by the UK of the Maastricht treaty is a prime example
of political necrophilia. In substance, the treaty is dead.
The world has been reminded forcefully of the incompatibility of (quasi-)
fixed exchange rates, independent national monetary policies and
unrestricted international mobility of financial capital. However, the
current alternative of a (quasi-) free float, independent national monetary
policies and unrestricted capital mobility, while feasible, is bound to lead
to unattractive behaviour of exchange rates and interest rates.
We should expect to see, once again, exchange rate overshooting, excess
volatility and persistent misalignment. Foreign exchange markets are
inhabited by nervous, myopic, private-sector herd animals, economically
illiterate politicians and wide-eyed innocents masquerading as central
bankers and monetary technocrats. How these players are driven matters
little if no two experts agree on what the fundamentals are or how they
affect exchange rates.
Regardless of the exchange rate regime, the basic incompatibility and
tension is between multiple currencies and independent national monetary
policies on the one hand, and unrestricted capital mobility on the other. If
we are to have unrestricted capital mobility, we need a single monetary
authority and preferably a single currency. If national currencies and
independent national monetary policies are retained, restrictions on
international capital movements are essential.
Since effective capital controls are hard to administer - and are
inconsistent with single market legislation - we are likely to see a
continuing exchange rate mess until a common European currency finally is
established.
The mechanics of monetary union are actually very simple; the principal
point is that it should come like a thief in the night. We will wake up and
discover that independent central banks have been abolished (after fixing
exchange rates for ever) and that currency control has been transferred to
the European central bank. This could happen as early as the second half of
the next decade.
It is fortunate that the process of European integration is strong enough to
survive one bad treaty.

There is plainly much to be said for Lord Goodman, even if he says a lot of
it himself. At the age of 80, he has chosen to tell all, or at least part,
of his remarkable life story. 'Remarkable' is his word, not mine. He had a
'remarkable' mother and a 'remarkable' grandfather and the adjective is
spread liberally throughout the book.
The slightly conceited title, Tell Them I'm On My Way, reads like an advance
warning to the spirits that he is looking forward to even higher things in
another place. Wherever he goes, he is sure to meet a pile of close friends,
most of them described as the best practitioner of this, that or the other
of their generation.
Not that Goodman has done badly on earth. As he states early on: 'I have
gravitated to almost every unpaid chairmanship in England at one time or
another.' Arts Council, Newspaper Publishers' Association, the Housing
Corporation and the Royal Opera House - Goodman had a hand in them all,
usually at the top.
Note the use of the word 'unpaid'. The author says that he realised as a
young man the conflict between 'those activities which one enjoyed, either
for themselves or because of a sense of virtue, and other activities which
one needed to do to keep alive: ie, to earn money from them'. Goodman drew a
sharp distinction between them. As a solicitor he made enough money to
enable him to be employed in public life for nothing. 'I have always pursued
the no doubt slightly sanctimonious attitude,' he writes, 'of refusing to be
paid for public service.'
Yet there must have been more to Goodman than that. Why was it that so many
people in public positions turned to him for advice?
Partly he was lucky in his early contacts. Everywhere he went he seemed to
meet somebody who could help him. Lloyd George enters on page 3.
Unfortunately Goodman was too young to be introduced, but he did know Edward
Heath's father long before most people had heard of the young Teddy. He was
put off economics at University College London, but by no less a person than
Hugh Gaitskell, who taught him for a term. In the war he met George Wigg who
urged him to be a Labour candidate in the 1945 general election. The seat in
mind was Tory-held and, Goodman thought, likely to remain so. In the event
it went Labour. Goodman reflects that history might have been changed if he
had stood.
One contact led to another. Although he never joined the Labour party, and
sometimes did not even vote for it, Goodman notes that almost all his
political connections were on the left. When Harold Wilson became prime
minister in 1964, it crossed Goodman's mind that he might be offered a job.
It came slightly later when he was made chairman of the Arts Council, but he
was also an unofficial adviser to Wilson, summoned whenever the prime
minister wanted. Other tasks followed, notably sounding out Ian Smith on a
Rhodesian settlement. Goodman thinks that if he had accompanied Wilson to
the Fearless talks in 1968, a settlement might have been reached.
By then, he was sometimes known as the Blessed Arnold. His role in
government continued in the Heath period when he still sought a Rhodesian
deal. Wilson had made him a peer; Heath made him a Companion of Honour. He
met the Queen alone, 'a tremendous privilege', writes Goodman, 'compared
with lining up with hundreds of others to receive some trivial award like a
knighthood'.
Still, it is with the early Wilson years that he will be most associated.
His contacts were useful, he was discreet and he was undoubtedly a clever
lawyer. Although it may seem an inappropriate metaphor for a man so
physically large, he worked like a rugby centre three-quarter, spotting a
gap and going for it fast. He was a lawyer who preferred to settle out of
court.
The newspaper world, development of commercial television and showbusiness
helped, since all involved legal work. Goodman says he never looked back
after advising Associated Newspapers in 1954 how to mount the Ideal Home
Exhibition with a lower tax bill.
Good fortune and good contacts dogged him for the rest of his life. In the
mid-1970s, when he was less active in politics, he was offered the
Mastership of University College Oxford despite remembering only one visit
to Oxford in his life and never having previously dined at High Table at
either Oxford or Cambridge. Naturally he accepted. He said he wanted little
to do with fund raising, but then found it quite easy to raise Pounds
300,000 for the college by a single letter. Other letters followed. Only
Armand Hammer turned him down.
The book contains big gaps. Goodman claims that the English legal system,
with its division between solicitors and barristers, is 'demented', but he
has not been prominent in seeking to reform it. He is unduly complacent
about the law of libel, out of which professionally he has not done badly.
His foreign travel is limited, his interest in economics non-existent, and
he does not say much about the changing state of Britain over time.
He professes a great love of theatre and music; the evidence here is
confined to name-dropping and fund-raising. He is also capable of great
contempt (though not, of course, in the legal sense) of the Foreign Office
in particular, the civil service in general, of Harold Wilson's other
cronies, sometimes of Wilson himself, and of practically every member of the
Tory party since 1979, though he is careful not to be too rude about Lady
Thatcher. His political hero, kept to the end for the encomium, was Harold
Macmillan.
In short, Lord Goodman seems a trifle pleased with himself. No intelligent
man, especially a lawyer, should write, as he does: 'I believe fervently.'
One may hope fervently; belief is a different matter.

Sir, An anecdote springs to mind in response to Dr M Singer's letter.
A colleague of mine was in the US for a series of meetings this summer. A
native of Spain, he is very much a smoker. As we sat in a conference room
waiting, he looked around for an ash tray. He did not find one and asked me
about it.
I pointed to a sign on the wall that said: 'Smoking in this room will only
be permitted once a consensus has been reached by all present.'
I guess that's the democratic 'No smoking' sign of the 1990s, although it
seems slightly out of place in a country that distributes free needles to
drug addicts. And for the record, I too am a non-smoker.

Sir, A good way to reduce the malign influence of currency speculators would
be to insist that all transactions should be in writing (or confirmed in
writing) in order to form a contract. Electronic transmission would be
acceptable. It would then be possible to require a delay of, say, three days
in clearing all transactions, as the banks find it 'necessary' to do with
cheques in order to persuade their clients to use debit cards.

EL MARIACHI (15)

EDINBURGH FIM FESTIVAL: BEST YOUNG FILM-MAKERS
LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS (PG)
Marcel Carne
HOT SHOTS] PART DEUX (12)
Jim Abrahams
LAKE CONSEQUENCE (18)
Rafael Eisenman
Hombres y mujeres, gather round the campfire. This week's story is 'El
Mariachi' and it is a cracker. Once in Mexico there was a handsome
travelling guitarist, or mariachi-player, who carried his instrument inside
a big black case. But one day a gangster's contract was put out on a
fugitive killer carrying an arsenal of guns concealed in - yes] - a
near-identical big black case.
You see the opportunities for comical-dramatical confusion? Simple but
inspired. And imagine them enacted in a movie. Woofling-whistling music
after Ennio Morricone; lunging visuals a la Sergio Leone; screen wide as a
water-melon slice; a girl; a town; a lot of chases; a crowning gunfight.
Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi touched its lighted cigar to festival fuses
this year and blew several happy audiences, including mine at Berlin, right
out of their seats. As often in cinema - see Metropolis, Casablanca,
L'Avventura, Airplane] - the most ridiculous plots are the most inspired.
Here we have mistaken identity to the power of infinity, as a simple mix-up
between black-suited itinerants becomes something like a Feydeau farce
played out in a Spaghetti Western set.
The timing does it. Who expects madness to be paced and choreographed like a
ballet? But from the first moody swagger into the first wide-angle bar; from
the first hair-raising zoom into the knuckle-cracking finger-flexing of a
harmonica player; from the first stomach-lurching camera movement that
challenges gravity and a heavy breakfast; from the first proof that the
sultry heroine means sado-sexual business ('Sing]' she hisses to the hero,
holding a knife to a sensitive body part as he sits in his bath); from the
first striking of the villain's match on his henchman's chin stubble; from
all this to the drop-dead grace and perfection of the showdown El Mariachi
is as major a delight as a minor film can be.
Made in Mexico by a first-time American director on a joke budget (Dollars
7000), it shows what human enterprise can do when tinged with judicious
insanity. (Rodriguez raised the money by hiring himself out as a guinea pig
for a drugs trial. Young film-makers, do not practise this at home.) The
movie has no content but more than enough style to make up the deficiency.
*****
The Edinburgh Film Festival, just begun, boasts El Mariachi plus Derek
Jarman's Blue (reviewed by me last week, announced for a London opening next
week) plus a serviceable blend of the past year's festival successes and
world or UK premieres.
These include Anthony Minghella's Mr Wonderful, John Sayles's Passion Fish,
Ken Loach's Raining Stones, Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden and the
customary egg-and-spoon race between young unknowns for the prize of Best
Young Film-Maker. The seniors mentioned have all produced modest work or
work already noted at other cine-sprees, so let us forget about them until
they reach public cinemas.
The youngsters, pitching apprentice shorts and non-features into the
Edinburgh pot, are a more intriguing mix of the craftsmanlike-conventional
with the wild and interesting.
Nicole Mitchell's Spring Belle (fly-on-wall fresco of a Sydney 'Come
Dancing' junket), Jon Camoy's Dinner With Malibu (teenage boy spies on Dad's
girlfriends) and Don McKellar's Blue (no relation to Jarman's film, but
starring rival movie-maker David Cronenberg as a porn-obsessed office boss)
are wry short stories on film: teasers well-lensed if a little tame in their
teasing.
Alexis Bisticas' The Clearing is stranger and more haunting: a camera's-view
saunter through a woodland where nice and naughty actions are glimpsed and
where a lonely saxophone sound leads on like Jack O' Lantern. Finally the
camera does a cut and about-turn and we see and recognise the walker's
famous face: that radiant, runic old phiz shining with secret knowledge and
transcendent questions. (To identify, think of the person we've referred to
most in these paragraphs).
But the best of the young movies is Dan Geva's Jerusalem: Rhythms Of A
Distant City. This handheld portrait of a waking town - Geva's hungry,
headlong camera devours everything from the morning's fresh loaves to the
first wailers at Jerusalem's Wall - is a mini-tribute to Ruttman's classic
documentary Berlin, Symphony Of A City and a knockout in its own right.
Kinetic technique matches kinetic vision: a pantherish pantheism leaping on
every detail small or large to celebrate the marvel of living and the even
greater marvel (in a city) of living together.
*****
Fifty years ago this week filming began on Les Enfants Du Paradis. Half a
century later, we are still marvelling. Back in a new print is the film the
French Academy once voted the country's best of all time: three hours of
romance, epigram and superfine melodrama set among theatre folk in 19th
century Paris. Lines crackle; faces glow or glower above the wing collars.
Pierre Brasseur's leonine actor, Marcel Herrand's preening
playwright/murderer, Jean-Louis Barrault's ice-featured mime (resembling
Kenneth Williams re-sculpted by Bernini) and Arletty's beauty of the
boulevard du crime, the melting-eyed Garance . . . Four-to-umpteen
characters caught up in a time of French history as troubled as that in
which the movie was made.
This may be the least filmic of all great films. Jacques Prevert's script,
Marcel Carnes direction, Alexandre Trauner's sets, conjured from the moral
and political rubble of Occupied France, are elegant, paperweight constructs
that sheer will and passion seem to have made monumental. The truth-based
main characters - only Garance had no historical forebear - step in and out
of their professional fictions no less surreally, but far more magically,
than A. Schwarzenegger did in Last Action Hero. And as in Olivier's
almost-contemporary Henry V, theatre is both matrix and metaphor for the
dramatic switchbackings that flow from it. A wonder; and at 50 younger than
ever.
*****
The rest of the week consists of a bad spoof and a worse skin-flick. Hot
Shots] Part Deux is a worthy sequel to Hot Shots] Part Un: 90 minutes of
legalised gag starvation with Charlie Sheen as our gung-ho hero, here
changed from trainee top-gunner to Rambo clone. He sports Stallone-style
hair and Stallone-style muscles. (Do these Hollywood stars go to a gym or
plug themselves into a giant bicycle pump?). And he has an urge to topple
Saddam Hussein (Jerry Haleva).
Saddam, of course, steals the show. Lighting his cigar with a desktop oil
derrick, hand-hoovering crumbs from his silk pajama trousers, raiding his
fridge for Camel Milk or Yankee Dog Burgers, he is a pantomime villain
turned politically-incorrect pratfaller. He is also the only funny thing for
miles around. Elsewhere, the jokes drop like stones; and the long, middle,
Saddamless section could be laughed at only by paid hyenas trained by 20th
Century Fox. I thought I heard some of these at the Press show.
Lake Consequence is funnier, though not by intention. From the stable of
executive producer Zalman King (9 1/2 Weeks, Full Moon Junction) comes
another high-faluting essay in soft porn, this one telling the story of the
Housewife (Joan Severance) and the Tree-pruner (Billy Zane). She fancies
him; he fancies her; off she goes, accidentally abducted when his trailer
moves off with her still in it.
They end up in Lake Consequence, wherever that is. Lots of Jacuzzis. Lots of
percussion and snare-drums on the soundtrack. (It sounds like a blue movie
filmed at the Peking Opera). And lots of Mount Rushmore-style sex, where
giant close-ups mean you cannot tell a nose from a thighbone, a pair of
breasts from a full moon junction. To enhance vision (if you could possibly
be interested), take a pair of binoculars and stare through the wrong end.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Arts: Mark Morris; Love Song Waltzes - Alastair Macaulay
explains why Morris is the most musical of choreographers / The Edinburgh
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So what if Edinburgh's Playhouse Theatre had a fire that has stopped the
Mark Morris Dance Group appearing there this year? The company has simply
transferred to the Meadowbank Stadium. The stage is large, the audience
shows a certain Dunkirk spirit in overcoming the auditorium's
inconveniences, and the final ovation is warmly enthusiastic. (Seating is
unreserved, so arrive 30 minutes early, and avoid the poor sightlines of
rows 3-10 of the front stalls.)
This is Morris's second Edinburgh Festival, and there are plans next year to
show his greatest work of all, the Handel L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il
Moderato, when the Empire Theatre reopens. There are several reasons why he
is a perfect Festival artist, and the most important reason why he is
perfect for a festival as musical as Brian McMaster's Edinburgh is that his
dances are supported by some of our most world-class musicians.
Morris is the most musical choreographer alive, and he is like Balanchine,
the greatest of all choreographers, in that he puts on shows where, if you
don't enjoy what you see, you can just close your eyes and listen to the
music. For his two danced sets of Brahms love-song waltzes, the excellent
company pianist Linda Dowdell is joined by Malcolm Martineau, and by a vocal
quartet all the more interesting (and Mark-Morris-like) because made up of
four dissimilar personalities: Amanda Roocroft's creamy, under-enouncing,
warm soprano; Felicity Palmer's urgent, cutting mezzo; John Mark Ainsley's
fastidiously elegant, youthful tenor; Thomas Allen's clouded, moving,
experienced baritone.
But watching helps you hear. Brahms's liebeslieder waltzer are so easy on
the ear that it is easy to miss the pictures of love's mixed pains and joys
they tell - but Morris's dances plunge you right back into the billows of
sexual desire, confusion, tenderness, fulfilment. His vision is modern,
barefoot, and bisexual; and, in the New Love Song Waltzes (Brahms's op. 65,
chor. 1982), he deconstructs it to the extent of having no waltzes and and
no duets. This is post-1960s love, and yet the dances are classical in that
they link back the 'democratic' un-virtuosic dance style of the 1960s
experimentalists, by way of Isadora Duncan's natural movement, through to
the chain dances of the Greeks.
New Love Song Waltzes is among the most loveable dances Morris has ever
made, and the way it catches sexual love passing around a whole community
makes it a classic. Love Song Waltzes (op. 52, chor. 1989) has less sex and
less emotional abandon, but it is an even more lucid response to its music -
and a remarkably serious portrait of a community dealing with love in our
time. There are fleeting portraits of despair, consolation, ardour amid a
group, but Morris's vision here is remarkably clear-eyed and controlled. By
the time he made this set of love-song waltzes, Aids has cast its shadow
over the world. Love Song Waltzes' is not about Aids, but it shows love and
community under that shadow.
Morris's gift for helping you hear music is most obvious, and wonderful, in
his 1993 realisations of two string quartets by Henry Cowell, Mosaic and
United. This is the kind of musical modernism that, though very eloquently
expounded here by the Emperor Quartet, might well bother a large audience -
but Morris's choreography draws you deep into its structures and its
mysteries. London saw this work finely danced a few months ago by the White
Oak group (including Baryshnikov); Morris's five dancers, however, are
greater masters of phrasing and contrasting dynamics, and so they reveal
their music in greater depth.
The choreography of Mosaic and United is highly economical, composed (like
the two Brahms sets, and so much of Morris's work) mainly of a few motifs.
How in this case Morris chose motifs so different and so satisfying is his
secret. The most memorable is a huge, slow arc that each dancer traces with
one arm, in which the whole upper body opens and expands; and this is
contrasted with a sharp lift of the heels while the dancers close their
flexed arms before their faces. Either move is in the modernist, abstract
spirit of the music; but the contrast is more musical yet, and helps to open
up atmospheres in the score.
This first Morris programme also has a world premiere, A Spell, set to four
Shakespeare songs by the Jacobean composer John Wilson (sung, rather
faintly, by Christopher Robson, with beautiful lute playing bu Tom
Finucane). It is a daffy, camp joke in which Morris transcends camp and
finally wipes the laughter off his audience's faces. He himself, dressed as
Cupid (with wings), unites and blesses two lovers (Ruth Davidson and
Guillermo Resto). It is deliberately ridiculous, and yet, even in his
opening dance, Morris marvellously contrasts his own broad scale of motion
with voluptuous delicacy of detail; he is the least embarrassed man you ever
saw onstage. And the lovers' story moves through cartoon mime to become
serious, and poignant.
You watch Morris's dances, and finally - though everything about his work is
accessible - you are encompassed by mystery. How does he makes his modern
visions so musically satisfying? How does he make his men and women, with
their different builds and colours and hairstyles, into an utterly
harmonious view of the world? How does he catch an audience so frequently
between laughter and seriousness, between bright and dark emotion? The
mystery, and the pleasure, grows with every performance of his work I see.
At the Meadowbank Stadium; Programme One until Thursday 19. Programme Two
August 21-23

Once again there is an abundance of sport and from 11 in the morning until 8
at night BBC2 is devoted to it pretty well exclusively. Athletics And
Cricket brings live coverage from the World Athletics Championships in
Stuttgart and the sixth Test (or 'Walkover') which begins today at the Oval.
Christopher Hitchens, described as 'cultural critic at large for Vanity
Fair' is one of those people who tend to be described as 'clever', a word
used by the chattering classes to mean pretentious, showy but shallow, or
supercilious. In Witness (9.00 C4) he reports on the leaders of some of the
bizarre cults in Los Angeles.
The questionable thesis in Episode 1 of Pandora's Box blinded me to the
strength of the other programmes when the series was first shown. The repeat
screening (9.30 BBC2) moves on to the story of 'the men on whom Dr
Strangelove was based ..who believed the world could be controlled by the
scientific manipulation of fear'.
BBC Proms Live features the American trumpeter Wynton Marsalis with his jazz
septet (10.05 BBC1 and Radio 3).

FT  19 AUG 93 / Arts: New opera, 'Anna'/ 'Tourist Variations' - The
Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noble intentions, dire results. To keep opera alive there is a continual
need for new works and in the last few years both the Royal Opera and
English National Opera have set up studios, where composers can watch their
operatic young struggling to take their first painful steps.
With noble commitment the Edinburgh Festival has now undertaken at least a
single exercise of a similar kind, acting jointly as midwife with the
Traverse Theatre. On Tuesday they presented two operatic premieres. The
Traverse ambitiously chose two of Scotland's leading young composers and two
equivalent dramatists to produce a pair of small-scale operas. Noble aims
indeed - but the offspring should have been smothered at birth.
Marginally the better of the two was Anna, words by John Clifford, music by
Craig Armstrong. A woman is dissatisfied with her life. Unabashed at boring
all around her with her troubles, she indulges in long periods of emotional
navel-gazing with four characters called North, South, East and West. By the
time one of them declares, 'Who are you? The self you've never known]', it
is clear that whichever point of the compass she heads for, she will end up
in pseuds' corner.
The music manages to build up some feeling of world-weariness as poor Anna
trudges the streets in despair, but Armstrong falls back far too easily on
repetitive minimalist note-spinning to accompany the long passages of
moralising. Pamela Helen Stephen, an involving singer, did her best to make
the hour bearable.
The other piece was Tourist Variations, a two-handed conversation piece
about tourism and the meaning of life. This sort of comedy where the most
banal statements are supposed to roll wit, satire, and cosmic relevance into
one is difficult to bring off, though Poulenc tried. The ingenuity to keep
it going for an hour would stretch the most brilliant minds and proved way
beyond Iain Heggie (words) and James MacMillan (music). Their package deal
was a one-way ticket to tedium. Eirian Davies and Alasdair Elliott were the
hard-working singers.
*****
In the morning there had been a recital of the latter composer's chamber
music at the Queen's Hall. James MacMillan is the special focus for new
music at this year's festival. Widely recognised as the front-runner among
young Scottish composers, publicly acclaimed by audiences at the Proms, he
is both an obvious and an enterprising choice for an Edinburgh
retrospective.
The recital was of early pieces. From the beginning MacMillan at his best
has been a distinctive voice, rhythmical, pungent, able to hit upon snappy
memorable ideas which are repeated for a minute or two, before he moves on.
Works such as the Piano Sonata probe darker feelings. It is interesting to
hear that his style, shorn of its vitality and unpredictability for Tourist
Variations, can be made to sound like Sondheim - but not encouraging. There
is more MacMillan next week.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Arts: Anne Evans makes debut recital - The Edinburgh
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three encores at the end of her Queen's Hall recital, the soprano Anne
Evans held up her hand to stop the audience asking for more. 'You'll have to
excuse me, as this is my first recital. Ever. You've heard it all.' Since
Evans has been singing for 25-odd years, this is a surprise; but this was an
accomplished debut in the form. And how smart of Brian McMaster to ask her
just now, while her Isolde has been making recent news, and to present her
as the opening recitalist.
Evans takes her place on the recital platform with simple dignity. One
admires, as one seldom can with a Wagnerian soprano, her wrists, her ankles.
Principally, however, the eye settles on her erect carriage and the striking
bone structure of her face. From seeing her, it is hard to believe that she
has already had a long career.
Or from hearing her. Evans's voice has real bloom, and this is surely what
has made her valued in the dramatic repertory. Where others are beefy or
clarion or steely or bovine, she has fragrance. Combine that with power and
commitment, and you have something rare. Her fare consisted of Berg's Seven
Early Songs, Schumann's Frauenliebe und-leben, and Wagner's Wesendonck
Lieder. When she greets spring in Wolf's 'Er ist's' (her first encore),
everything is in harmony. She is equally eloquent in revealing her late
husband's sleep of death in the Schumann, and in the softly ascents of
anguished desire in Wagner's 'Im Treibhaus'.
But Evans is not consistently eloquent, and the basic musicianship that
gives her so sure a sense of the shape of each song has a few faults. The
vowels and consonants (however clearly delivered) are not naturally married;
and she is seldom free in most open 'e' vowel sounds. Her conception of
legato is also imperfect. Very often she 'pings' into a new note, and then
adds vibrato (a) to hoist it up into tune (b) to swell its volume. The
impulse that shapes each note overrules the impulse that links the notes
into a phrase.
When a phrase or a song works for Evans, these flaws vanish, and her voice
is completely focused in its utterance. Elsewhere, her sound is lovely
enough to please an audience; she is intelligently involved in words even
when she does not communicate them effectively. But she is still an immature
artist. Perhaps the new challenge of the recital platform is what she needs.

FT  19 AUG 93 / People: De Beers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is turning out to be a year to remember for Chips Keswick, chairman of
Hambros Bank. Knighted in the New Year, he then joined the illustrious group
who are directors of the Bank of England - and now has topped all that by
becoming a director of De Beers, the South African group which dominates the
world diamond business.
As a regular visitor to South Africa, Sir Chips is well-known to the
business community there and, more important, is well-known to Julian
Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of both De Beers and its sister organisation, the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Rupert Hambro, a former chairman
of Hambros Bank, has been a non-executive director of Anglo for more than
ten years.
The connections between Hambros, De Beers and the diamond market go back
many more years. The UK merchant bank is reputed to have provided a vital
link between De Beers and the former Soviet Union in the days when
international politics decreed there should be no formal relationship
between them. According to trade sources, Hambros bought most of the Soviet
rough (uncut) diamonds and made sure that most ended up safely with De
Beers' cartel, which controls about 80 per cent of the market. After the
collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no longer any need for this ruse and
Russia quickly joined the cartel.

FT  19 AUG 93 / People: Hammerson slims down its board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hammerson, the UK property company, yesterday announced the first of a
number of measures designed to cut overheads and rationalise its management
structure; they are being introduced by Ron Spinney, the company's new chief
executive, who was appointed in April.
Jon Scott, the head of Hammerson's property management operation, has
resigned from the board and left the company. John Richards will now be
responsible for the UK operations which comprise its property management and
development interests.
Bruce Heyland and Tony Ball have resigned from the board in order to devote
their time more fully to operational responsibilities for overseas
subsidiaries - in Canada and the US, and in Australasia, respectively. They
have not been compensated for leaving the board.
Hammerson says these changes are 'designed to provide a clearer division
between group and operational management responsibilities'. The group has
also cut the number of head office staff from 67 to 57. The redundancies
covered property, financial and communications staff.
Hammerson is one of the UK's strongest property companies having
strengthened its balance sheet with a Pounds 199m rights issue in May.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 31.1m in 1992, down from Pounds 55.5m in 1991.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sing Singapore -
Courtesy, punctuality and fecundity have all been the subject of state
campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore's 2.8m inhabitants are living proof that patriotism, politeness
and punctuality - even fecundity - can be marketed and advertised by
governments in much the same way that washing powder is sold by soap
manufacturers.
For more than a decade advertising agencies on the island have done brisk
business for a famously dirigiste government, bombarding citizens with
campaigns urging them to love their country, turn up at wedding parties on
time and flush the lavatory.
The campaign to persuade people to have fewer babies was so successful that
the anxious authorities have made a U-turn and are now pleading with them to
have more.
One of the pioneers in selling feelings rather than products in Singapore
was the British-educated Richard Tan Kok Tong, a former defence official and
head of the information ministry's psychological defence unit - wisely
renamed the publicity department - who is now responsible for corporate
advertising at Singapore Press Holdings.
In 1981 on a visit to the UK, Tan was so impressed by the patriotic mood in
London's Albert Hall on the last night of the Proms he decided to use songs
to create what he calls a 'Ra] Ra] Rule Britannia kind of spirit' in
multi-racial Singapore.
The early hit song 'Stand up for Singapore' became the basis for a
continuing campaign called 'Sing, Singapore'. And, since then neither the
government nor the advertising industry has looked back.
Ten years ago the defence ministry took the revolutionary step of using
advertising to sell the idea of 'total defence' - involving civilians as
well as troops. The SDollars 1m (Pounds 435,000) budget was at that time the
largest in the history of Singapore, says Tan. 'I was given a special award
by the industry before I left the government]'
Last year the government bought advertising space worth SDollars 9.7m for
its various campaigns, according to Survey Research Singapore, the island's
main advertising research group. In the first half of 1993, the Family Life
Education Programme, which features sugary, televised scenes of happy
families in an attempt to encourage Singaporeans to have more children, was
the fourth biggest brand campaign in the country and spent SDollars 1.93m -
slightly less than Kentucky Fried Chicken.
'Government campaigns are quite sought after by advertising agencies,' says
Rosalind Chan, group account director of J. Walter Thompson in Singapore.
'They do have pretty big budgets.'
The Courtesy Campaign, for example, dates back more than 10 years and is
still going strong with an annual budget of SDollars 600,000, in addition to
corporate sponsorship.
Among the government's latest targets are Singaporeans who are too greedy at
buffet lunches; a poster bearing the slogan 'If we could only see ourselves
sometimes' shows a man putting a whole lobster on a plate already groaning
with noodles, meat, vegetables and prawns.
Measuring the results and effectiveness of campaigns about such ambiguous
notions as patriotism and politeness is inevitably a subjective affair.
Non-Singaporeans, when questioned on the value of government campaigns are
apt to laugh or groan. 'These gooey adverts on TV really are horrible if you
come from a different cultural background,' says one westerner after
watching a 'family life' spot.
The consensus among Singaporeans, however, is that the campaigns do work in
Singapore because the inhabitants are accustomed to official exhortations
and even the young are accustomed to obeying them.
Ivan Chong, president of the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents
says: 'They grew up in a campaign society.'
The main concern of agencies is that Singaporeans will suffer from 'campaign
fatigue' - already the government assigns most of the dozen or so current
campaigns to specific months to avoid overlaps.
Some observers say that cosmopolitan, well-travelled young Singaporeans are
less receptive to official browbeating than their elders and have even been
known to mock government campaigns. 'They are not all robots here,' says one
foreign businessman.
Tan, however, could be viewed as a walking advertisement for the Singaporean
campaigns. Not only did he meet his wife through the official match-making
service of the social development unit, but he also launched the National
Punctuality Drive at his wedding. A few late-comers to the wedding were
shown the extent of their misdemeanour the next morning when they discovered
themselves pictured with superimposed clocks in the newspaper. 'I was so
worried that my relatives would scold me,' he says.
Tan says the willingness of Singaporeans to respond to government campaigns
is rooted in the belief that they inhabit a vulnerable, disparate nation of
recent migrants surrounded by the large Moslem populations of Indonesia and
Malaysia.
'We have a background where the people are told you're here as migrants and
we either pull together or we get hanged together,' he says. 'It's against
this sort of precondition that people can accept this sort of propaganda.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): New universities
educate their public - The former polytechnics' efforts to establish a
suitable and memorable image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's old polytechnics have spent the past year grappling with an
awkward task - establishing their new university brand image.
Marketeers have two problems. One is to imprint their new names, some of
which have changed radically, on public consciousness. The other is to
reverse the widespread perception that has existed for decades, that the old
polytechnics were second-class institutions compared with universities.
Any such distinction is now officially at an end. Last year, the government
removed the 'binary divide' between universities and polytechnics, because
it had been seen as redundant and a barrier to the expansion of higher
education. The former polytechnics are now funded by and answerable to the
government, rather than local authorities.
The evidence is that marketeers have done a good job: applications to new
universities through the Polytechnics Central Admissions System rose by 5
per cent this year, in spite of a fall in the number of 18-year-olds.
But the methods used have varied widely.
De Montfort University - formerly Leicester Polytechnic - has been the most
ambitious. It launched a Pounds 500,000 multi-media campaign earlier this
month aimed at 18-year-olds, whose A-level results do not reach expectations
and who will be looking for a place via the clearing system.
All the stops have been pulled out. Central to the campaign is a 30-second
cinema and television commercial featuring a voice-over from Angus Deayton.
It uses footage from Sir David Attenborough's BBC documentary 'Trials of
Life', which shows a nimble sealion shrugging off a killer whale attack.
Computer graphics at the end of the commercial are provided by De Montfort's
school of design and manufacture, and reinforce the message that to be
nimble and ahead of the competition, like the sealion, you need a university
degree.
The commercial is appearing on Channel 4 in two, four-week bursts, which
started on August 9 and will run until mid-October. It is also appearing on
349 London area cinema screens and 209 Midlands screens. And a similarly
aggressive newspaper campaign is in progress, targeted at broadsheets, with
the slogan: 'The Real World. Entry visas now available at De Montfort
University.'
The old polytechnics have traditionally taken most of their students from
their locality, so De Montfort's national campaigns could be seen as first
steps to cutting links with the local area.
Michael Brown, De Montfort's executive pro-vice-chancellor, said: 'In market
research we've found that the choice of university is very whimsical. The
problem is that customers' perceptions lag behind. We are trying to find a
professional way to challenge people's perceptions about what's on offer.'
Marketing departments of other new universities are watching De Montfort's
experiment with keen interest. While some say that this level of expenditure
for marketing is beyond them, others are trying similar, less ambitious
campaigns.
Teesside University's new image is centred around an ambitious logo,
designed using the tangram pieces, which spell out the university's
initials.
The logo has been designed by Bush Hollyhead, a freelance graphic designer.
Ms Helen Pickering, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, said the design is intended to
reflect the university's identity, 'offering flexibility and modularity as
well as quality'.
Teesside has ensured that its new corporate identity is impressed hard on
the educational community by running a series of advertisements featuring
the logo on the front page of the Guardian.
In London, most of the new universities are content to reinforce their
standing with traditional target groups. South Bank University - formerly
South Bank Polytechnic - has opted to spend heavily on poster advertising in
the London Underground.
In common with De Montfort's campaign, the message is aimed at name
recognition, and propagating the benefits of a university education. There
is little attempt to sell any benefits specific to South Bank. South Bank's
marketing department says: 'We have to be imaginative because we can't take
for granted the fact that people will know about us.'
This led to a cheeky poster campaign, where underground travellers see a big
(though technically incorrect) slogan 'We Can't Advertise', followed by more
sober advertising copy in smaller letters apologising for not being able to
explain that a South Bank degree would improve a candidate's chance in the
job market.
The University of North London - formerly the Polytechnic of North London -
has cut spending on advertising this year. Instead, it has chosen to enforce
its new brand image on its local community.
UNL has several imposing modern buildings throughout the London boroughs of
Camden and Islington. All now are 'badged' with large versions of the
university's new logo - a design of a welcoming figure with outstretched
arms - and its new name.

FT  19 AUG 93 / People: Mosaic adds another piece
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Davison, a former managing director of County NatWest Ventures, is to
take over the helm of Mosaic Investments, a troubled mini-conglomerate best
known for handling the marketing rights to cartoon characters such as Roland
Rat, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tom and Jerry and Thunderbirds.
Davison, 50, will take over from Hugh Sykes, 60, the company doctor who was
brought in last October shortly after Mosaic's shares had been suspended
because it could not raise sufficient funds to redeem a preference share
issue.
Mosaic had been an acquisitive glamour stock for a brief period during the
1980s, and its reputation was boosted by the fact that Tomkins chief
executive Greg Hutchings was a big shareholder.
However, when the company ran into serious financial problems Hutchings, who
took on the chairmanship briefly, turned to Sykes to sort out the company.
Several poorly performing and loss-making businesses have been sold and the
company has been refinanced. A Pounds 2m preference share issue will
eliminate borrowings and leave it with net assets of Pounds 8.7m. The
shares, which touched Pounds 5.15 at one stage, were suspended at 60p. They
resumed trading seven months later at 19p and had recovered to 24p
yesterday.
Having completed his company doctoring role, Sykes says that it is time to
hand over to someone to take the company forward. Leon Angrave, Mosaic's
managing director, resigned last week and it is expected that Davison's role
will be a semi-executive one which will occupy a substantial proportion of
his time.
Davison, who was found through headhunters, is a non-executive director of
Pepe group, the international jeanswear group, and Holliday Chemical
Holdings. After building County NatWest Ventures into one the biggest
development capital companies in the UK, Davison spent four years heading
Business Mortgages Trust, a listed bank, which he reorganised and sold to
Nykredit, a Danish mortgage company, following a hostile bid from National
Home Loans in 1989.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doug Ritchie, who as chairman and chief executive of British Alcan Aluminium
was responsible for most of the UK's aluminium production, has died of
cancer in Montreal at the age of 52.
Four years after Alcan of Canada bought British Aluminium for Pounds 30m in
1982 and merged it with its own UK operations, Ritchie was appointed chief
executive with the task of turning what had been two domestic companies into
one internationally competitive group.
He presided over a Pounds 300m investment and rationalisation programme
which saw substantial cuts in capacity; the workforce was nearly halved but
there were consequent huge productivity gains.
Ritchie was born in Ontario and attended McGill University where he was
awarded a BSc and an MBA. He joined Alcan in 1966 as a sales supervisor in
Toronto. He filled a variety of posts before emerging in 1985 as vice
president of Alcan's primary and secondary metals group - giving him
responsibility for all the group's North American aluminium smelting and
sales activities.
In 1991 he became chairman of British Alcan as well as chief executive. At
that time a reorganisation of Alcan's European operations put him in charge
of all primary and secondary aluminium operations in Europe except for those
related to rolled products.
He leaves a wife, Cydney, and three grown-up sons.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Mass of fine print may obscure judgments
 -Roger Davis argues that professional experience and instinct should count
for more than rigid adherence to the rule book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE unsurprising event for accounting and auditing this year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with the unprecedented volume of pronouncements - has been the cry of 'too
much'. But I have another concern: over-engineer the rules and you will
endanger accountancy as a real profession.
There are still too many options for accounting for the same thing, when no
one way can rationally be said to be right or best. The Accounting Standards
Board needs support and encouragement in resolving the remaining issues. It
is time, also, to extract ourselves from a stick-in-the-mud attitude to the
need to redefine and revitalise the audit.
But you need a well sharpened pencil to draw the line between narrowing
choices and compromising professional judgments. I readily acknowledge that
practising accountants should now reassert the authority of those judgments
and thus render an almighty rule book unnecessary.
For that is what professionalism means: forming judgments from professional
experience and then sticking to what your guts tell you, however tough the
going. Most accounting is commonsense. An experienced auditor conducting a
rapid financial investigation of a company will instinctively judge its
financial state without pondering over the fine print of the rule book.
That is what a good audit represents, or should do. But I am currently
seeing its reverse. The threat of sanctions (not least through litigation
for absurd sums) engenders an attitude which says 'stick to what the rules
say - it's safer'.
Auditing should remain an art. It is overlooked that the term derives from
the latin auditore - to listen; that is, to listen to explanations and to
judge on whether they stand up. The growing complexity of the different
parts which make up a business, and of the environment in which it
functions, requires more judgment, not less, by the auditor.
The problem is that the more rules you have, the more the avoidance industry
will find the loopholes; and the inevitable consequence being yet more
rules. It is so obvious that I stress it only because it is what I see
happening in practice. Write a 50-page standard on the meaning of each of
the 10 commandments and those inclined to adultery will find something to
excuse their indulgence.
Applying that analogy to accounting, you find the need for yet more
explanatory notes to the accounts as an excuse for not getting the figures
right in the first place. It adds yet further to the complexity of company
accounts.
There is a danger of reaching a level of auditing and accounting precision
with which business will not be able to cope. Companies will adopt one
accounting policy for their external reporting and another for internal
management purposes. There can be no sense in that.
I fear for a profession more concerned with whether the figures get into the
right boxes, rather than with a sensible overall picture of business
performance, encapsulated in this recent exchange with one of our brightest
managers: 'If you were running this company would you think you had done
well or badly?' answered by 'It depends on how you interpret the standard'.
So we have a stark choice. Auditors will go on shielding behind an
ever-growing rule book. Or they will stand up to be counted on accounting
that flies in the face of commonsense; I believe auditors did lose some of
that culture in the 1980s, because of competitive pressures to retain
business in an environment which was already encouraging a legalistic
approach to accounting.
Thankfully, my evidence is that the climate has changed; company boards are
increasingly asking auditors robustly to challenge their thinking on
financial reporting and stewardship. The practising accountant should
capitalise on the mood.
For I fear the consequences if the trend continues and a rule book mentality
really does get a grip on auditing and accountancy. At best you will narrow
the outlook of the people in the profession and they will increasingly lose
sight of the underlying commercial drivers of the business being audited. At
worst you will no longer be able to attract or retain those with the able
and agile minds auditing needs if it is to serve the public interest.
It will also be deleterious to the outstanding business training which the
profession has traditionally given to its graduates and from which industry
has benefited.
That is equally true of more rules on what the auditor can and cannot do,
such as so-called audit quarantining to build fences between auditors and
management: a red herring if ever there was one, and something that betrays
an outdated understanding of the profession.
Because the professional accountant's traditional business advice has
required more specialism, many accountancy firms have become
multi-disciplinary partnerships. Rather than threatening audit independence,
all their services represent a professional challenge, founded on the audit
discipline. Increasingly audit itself needs industry and functional
specialists from non-accounting disciplines.
The final audit report to shareholders should be based on regular assurance
to management from a unique professional perspective, and by working on the
correct assumption that most British management is trying to do its best for
stakeholders.
When the chairman of one of our largest clients said to me recently, 'As the
company's auditor, do you think the board should involve itself in this
transaction whose ethics could be questioned?' should I have said 'I am not
allowed to advise you but I will tell you after the event'?
The good auditor has a knack of sensing those who are only on the make for
themselves. No amount of rules will help: not highly prescriptive accounting
standards; not lengthy auditing standards; not lengthier company accounts;
and not longer audit reports. Quite simply an auditor should not put his or
her name to a company report if the professional instinct says the basic
message is wrong. But that is not the way we are going.
This is where we get back to professionalism. It is about none of the above,
but the ability and attitude of those who work in the profession.
The vicious circle is ever more regulations and a disinclination for
brighter graduates to join the party.
The virtuous circle is the opposite. Can auditors be trusted with
flexibility? Auditors have to earn that trust. I suggest:
Practising accountants should view the rule books as the underpinning and
not the driver of their judgments.
They should be able to stand up for those judgments without fear of the
consequences. So they need support, which they don't always get, not just
from company managements but from all those institutions who share the
responsibility for good corporate governance.
Those who write the rules should concentrate on the spirit and avoid the
growing tendency to over-engineer commonsense subjects.
Those who interpret the rules in regulating company accounts and auditing
should do likewise. For example, I would like to see the Financial Reporting
Review Panel taking to task those who have followed the rules when to do so
was perverse.
Quite simply, without trust professionalism is dead.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Technology: In search of quality - A look at an automated
product that aims to filter computer data for flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principle 'garbage in, garbage out' is a basic feature of computers.
With the personal computer has come personal data, which has made things
worse, not better.
Research carried out at Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that
data stored in a spreadsheet such as Excel is generally unuseable by anyone
other than its author. This is a chilling discovery because many
organisations rely on data held in personal spreadsheets for critical
decisions. It hardly matters how fast information is delivered to the
screen, if the data is untrustworthy.
Everyone has stories about a stupid computer and the problems can usually be
traced to human error - mis-keying - but more seriously, they result from
systems design. For example, a parent who complained that British Waterways
had tried to charge a 10-year-old the full price for his dinghy licence was
told, 'the computer can't tell he's a juvenile'.
If that is so, then not only is the data incomplete, but the system design
is at fault. The word 'quality' appears in almost every annual report as an
objective, or point of pride. Quality can be built into a car, by a process
of training, evaluation and checking.
Applying the rule of quality to data is more difficult, and many systems
have foundered on this. This was the conclusion of Robert P Goldberg, a
professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management. Research at MIT proved the
unreliability of data, not only personal, as in spreadsheets, but
departmental. Goldberg, the co-developer of the Best/1 package which is used
worldwide to measure and plan computer capacity performance, and his
researchers have produced a piece of software to help measure 'data
quality'.
This is a different job from validation of data, which is often done by
screen checks that set parameters for the entry of certain values. Sometimes
checks can be overwritten, but data can be corrupted by valid, but totally
meaningless entries. Often, this happens when the person entering the data
has no ultimate interest or responsibility - known as ownership - of the
results.
A common cause of flaws is the 'code that works'. For instance, a data entry
screen on a customer might ask for various items, including the SIC, or
Standard Industry Code. The finance clerk entering the data is in a hurry to
enter current values and find out about this month's late payers. The SIC
code is irrelevant to the immediate task, but has to be entered, so the
quick solution is to find any valid code that works - oil industry will do
nicely - and keep entering it as a way of getting past the SIC field. The
result is that some time later, the marketing department gets very excited
about making such promising strides in the oil industry, and mounts a direct
mail campaign, on totally inaccurate information.
Another common problem is a value field set up for one purpose, but used for
another unrelated function, by some system of values or codes that means
something to one department but not to anyone else. Goldberg and his MIT
research team have plenty of horror stories, such as the airline that flew
aircraft half-empty due to 'phantom bookings' made by test data. The QDB
Analyze software the team developed is aimed at improving data quality by
applying some of the mechanical and engineering processes used in total
quality management.
'Quality' depends upon a subjective evaluation in which accuracy, integrity,
consistency, completeness and timeliness are all elements. 'An increasing
amount of information is becoming a fundamental part of decision making,'
says Ken Ledeen, chief executive officer of QDB Solutions, the company set
up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to market QDB Analyze worldwide. 'It is
dramatically increasing the visibility of inaccuracy. There are no clean
sheets any more. You might be sitting down with new software tools but old
data derived from existing databases.'
What matters, says Ledeen, is the process behind the data. 'There is no
absolute definition of correct or accurate. The priorities have to be set
according to the payoff, and that means determining what the system does and
what the user needs from it.'
He cites JP Morgan, the banking and investment institution in New York,
whose expertise in risk management was undermined by poor quality data. The
data on its credit-risk management database was only 60 per cent complete,
and any user had to double-check. Using QDB Analyze, JP Morgan discovered
the problem was one of accuracy taking precedence over timeliness.
Timeliness is more important in risk management, because the users need to
know immediately a transaction had taken place: they are less bothered
whether it is worth Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.60m) or Dollars 7.5m.
Jonathan Kutchins, president of the Exeter Group, a consulting and software
company in Cambridge, Mass is an enthusiastic user of QDB for his clients.
'QDB Analyze acts almost like a cleanser. It gives you statistics about your
data over a period of time, but as well as overall metrics, it can, on
request, provide actual instances of bad data,' says Kutchins. 'It's one
thing to correct data, but another to correct the process that resulted in
the flaw in the first place.'
According to Kutchins, the PC-based product is easy to use, and capable of
downloading large datasets - not just samples - from many different
mainframe database products. QDB Analyze is one of a very few automated
products available for data filtering.
People, not computers, used to do the job of 'filtering data', a point
particularly relevant in the recession-hit UK, according to Rick Marengo. He
is the managing director of Softool Rack, the Wokingham-based software tools
specialist recently appointed as the UK agent for QDB Solutions. 'The middle
managers simply are not there any more to filter out the rubbish' he says.
'The accuracy of the data becomes paramount.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / Technology: A mould breaker - Advances in chromium plating
may have far-reaching implications for the car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, Diesel Marine International received a telephone call out of
the blue from Nissan, the Japanese motor manufacturer which was building a
press shop for its car plant at Washington, Tyne and Wear, England.
'They were interested in our chrome-plating tank,' says David Batie,
director of DMI, based in nearby North Shields and one of the largest
industrial chromium platers in Europe. 'They said they couldn't possibly
press car panels without chromium-plating the dies.'
This, says Batie, was news to DMI, part of the Newcastle-based Torday &amp;
Carlisle group and a long-established supplier of new and reconditioned
parts for marine diesel engines.
However, five years later DMI is enthusiastically expanding its links with
Europe's car and truck industry to exploit an opportunity that could
transform both it and its parent company.
The story combines technology, differing cultural attitudes in the European
and Japanese car industries, and environmental and cost issues in car
production.
Pressings was always the poor relation in the European car industry, says
Batie. There is only one cast-iron die, and its associated blankholder and
punch, for each panel and it is kept going throughout a model's production
run with welded repairs to mend cracks, fill holes and keep it to the right
shape.
Damaging a die beyond repair is a serious matter for a car company - it
would take months to make a new one. So any new approach was greeted with
extreme caution.
In the 1970s, the advantages of chrome-plating press dies were understood -
cheaper, easier-to-machine iron could be used under the chrome, and the dies
would last longer - but the process could not be perfected. Producing an
even layer of chrome across the contours and cavities of a car die was
difficult, and getting the chrome to stick to a mixed surface with all the
repairs and modifications was also hard. The idea was quietly dropped.
Typically, though, the Japanese motor manufacturers, in co-operation with
chromium-plating companies, kept going. Overall product quality, consistency
and cost savings from 'lean manufacturing' were factors. On top of that was
the competitive environment. More frequent model changes and shorter
production runs meant more dies, giving an incentive to find cheaper
production methods.
But the biggest spur, says Batie, came in the mid-1980s with the more
widespread use of zinc-coated steels to reduce corrosion. The zinc powder
would stick to the cast-iron die, causing pimples on the body panels. Large
presses which can cost up to Pounds 5,000 an hour to run would regularly be
stopped for 15-20 minutes for the dies to be cleaned.
Typically, too, the solution has not come about through any quantum leap in
technology by the Japanese, but through perseverance over 20 years in
perfecting the chromium-plating process, adjusting the variables such as the
positioning of anodes to achieve a very thin micron layer of chromium across
the die surface.
Encouraged by Nissan, which was keen to have a local chromium-plating
company working for it, DMI took a licence for the process in 1989 from
Japan's Koka Chrome Industries, which has worked for Nissan on the process
over the past 17 years.
DMI is receiving dies at its North Shields plant, at its Dutch plant in
Zwolle and has a sub-licensee in Barcelona. It dechromes and rechromes the
dies in about two days and returns them to customers. Batie says putting
chromium on a die has a number of advantages beyond cutting the initial die
cost. The chromium can act as a wear indicator if the grey iron shows
through. The die can be quickly rechromed before welding is needed and
consistency in the pressing can be maintained.
The shininess of the chromium surface works much better with zinc-coated
steels, says Batie, but the chromium also has a natural 'lubricity' which is
important for environmental reasons.
Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are tightening up on the use
of lubricating oil in industry, but the chromium dies remove the need to
lubricate the steel and prevent it tearing and splitting as the die punches
into it.
New 'laser-textured' steels, designed to give a high finish with minimum
paint, are particularly difficult to 'draw' without lubrication when using a
normal cast-iron die, says Batie.
DMI is already working regularly with all the Japanese car manufacturers in
Europe and Rover, Renault and Saab. It has reached differing stages of
contact with several other groups, and has also chromed dies for the German
pressings subcontractor Benteler.
The process has generated immense interest in the industry, says Batie,
although this has not always been turned into business. Some companies still
remember past difficulties with chromium-plated dies, or are tackling the
problem differently by using specially-hardened cast iron.
But, in a European motor industry that has learnt so much from Japanese
manufacturing techniques, the background to the process gives DMI
credibility. Even in Germany, the motor industry's problems have forced
engineers to become much more receptive to Japanese ideas.
The challenge for DMI, and for Paul Torday, chief executive of the parent
company, is to work out how quickly to expand the service. The
chromium-plating plants have to be reasonably close to the customers, yet
each need several clients to be economical.
For this reason, and because effluent problems associated with the use of
chromic acid and other chemicals used in chromium-plating make it difficult
to obtain a licence for a new chromium-plating plant in Europe, Torday
believes DMI is most likely to expand through acquisition or joint ventures.
It is considering a plant near Paris and another in the south of France for
the Italian market.
The new business could account for as much as half of DMI's turnover -
currently Pounds 18m - in three to four years, excluding possible
non-automotive markets such as white goods.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Maxwell policy writ issued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS to the companies formerly owned by Robert Maxwell have
begun legal proceedings against insurers that are refusing to settle a
policy on the life of the publisher.
A writ has been issued seeking payment of more than Pounds 10m on a personal
accident policy taken out for Mr Maxwell by four companies.
The companies are Maxwell Communication Corporation, Mirror Group
Newspapers, and two businesses within the private empire, Robert Maxwell
Group and Headington Investments.
The writ and statement of claim lodged in the High Court name more than a
dozen companies including several UK large composite insurers.
The move follows a breakdown in discussions for a compromise out-of-court
settlement without an acceptance of liability by all the insurers involved
which would have generated Pounds 6.5m.
Just over half of the insurers involved agreed to the settlement, which has
led to payments so far of about Pounds 3.5m. Those now being sued are being
pursued for their share of the value of the gross claim, which was Pounds
20m.
The insurers have argued that if Maxwell was assassinated or committed
suicide, his policy would be void.
Under a recent tentative agreement - subject to final approval by creditors'
committees - MCC and MGN will each receive about one third of the proceeds
of the policy, and the two private companies will take the remainder, which
will be divided equally between them.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Currencies 'face more turmoil'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE could be facing more currency turmoil in spite of the decision to
widen the fluctuation margins of the European exchange rate mechanism to 15
per cent, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned
yesterday.
In its quarterly report the economic research body said the failure of the
ERM demonstrated the weakness of market intervention as a means of defending
exchange-rate bands.
Moving to a system of wider bands or even free-floating 'does not put the
monetary authorities back in control', it said.
Mr Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University and
one of the Treasury's seven-strong panel of independent economic
forecasters, today warns that market forces alone are insufficient to save
the European Community from 'endemic recession'.
Writing in today's London Review of Books, he says there is a pressing need
for 'some supranational authority, call it a federal government' to pursue
macro-economic policies.

FT  19 AUG 93 / MPs back right to levy interest on late debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to introduce a statutory right to interest on
overdue commercial debts mounted yesterday with the results of a survey
suggesting that four out of five MPs support the proposal.
The Forum of Private Business published the survey alongside a draft bill
that would allow companies to claim interest from late-paying customers for
up to six years after the debt arises. Businesses that had failed to make
payments on time would also have to record those payments as contingent
liabilities in their accounts.
The organisation, which represents more than 20,000 companies, said small
businesses were owed about Pounds 50bn in overdue debts, with an average
81-day wait for payment.
The organisation called on the government to tackle the issue and said there
was wide support for the principle of statutory interest.
The Department of Trade and Industry is examining measures to deal with late
payments but has so far concentrated on a proposal for large companies to
state in their accounts the average time taken to pay bills.
Baroness Denton, small-business minister, has said she is not convinced that
statutory interest will lead to an improvement in payment performance.
The DTI said last night that the draft bill would be 'closely examined' to
establish whether it was practical.
Under the organisation's proposals, companies would remain free to agree
their own contractual terms.

<TEXT>
ONE IN five UK exporters has suffered losses during the past year because of
non-payment by customers elsewhere in the European Community, NCM Credit
Insurance, Britain's leading export credit insurer, said yesterday.
The cost of payment delays rose 52 per cent in the 12 months to June 30, it
said in a quarterly study. For reasons of market secrecy it did not reveal
the cash cost of payment delays.
'The outlook for UK exports, 60 per cent of which normally go to the EC,
remains bleak,' said Ms Conni Randall, NCM business strategy director.
Among the leading EC markets, losses due to non-payment were highest in
France, where 20 per cent of exporters reported losses in the 12 months to
June 30. Even Germany, regarded as one of Europe's most stable export
markets, saw one in 14 companies reporting losses.
Payment delays grew most strongly in Italy - up 150 per cent between June
1992 and June this year. Delays rose by more than 60 per cent in Germany.
NCM, the Dutch-controlled company which two years ago acquired the
short-term export credit arm of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee
Department, claims to account for 80 per cent of private-sector export
insurance in the UK. Last year it provided cover for exports worth about
Pounds 14bn.
The database it used for the quarterly study draws on records of 2.5m
companies worldwide.

The boxes, donated by British Telecommunications, date from the 1920s and
1930s and are expected to raise more than Pounds 1,000 each for the Prince's
Youth Business Trust and local community work. Each will have a Dartmoor
Prison brass plaque. There have already been a number of inquiries about the

FT  19 AUG 93 / Crisis fears over Pounds 50bn PSBR played down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's forecast of a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing
requirement for this financial year does not spell crisis for Britain's
public finances, a leading UK economic research body reported yesterday.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said in its latest
quarterly economic review that current fiscal policy was sustainable. It
said that recent government actions would tend to stabilise the PSBR at
about 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product by the late 1990s, compared
with the 8 per cent of GDP officially envisaged for 1993-94.
The institute, in its forecast for the UK economy, assumes that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, will announce a further Pounds 2.5bn of tax
increases in the November Budget on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of tax increases
for 1994-95 and the Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96 introduced in the March
Budget.
It said that the government's case for fiscal tightening in November should
not rest on 'such insecure foundations' as fears about future debt levels.
'The need to raise tax rates to stabilise the debt stock has been greatly
exaggerated,' the institute commented.
It said tax increases in November would be more justifiable as part of a
policy switch in which taxes were raised and interest rates cut to maintain
demand. Such a policy change might be advisable if interest rates were to
fall sharply elsewhere in Europe or the pound were to rise strongly,
undermining the competitiveness of UK exports.
The institute's analysis suggests that the ratio of general government gross
debt to GDP will stay well within the Maastricht treaty criterion of 60 per
cent of GDP in the years ahead. While the ratio will rise from an estimated
40.4 per cent last year, it should stabilise a little below 50 per cent by
the end of the decade, it said.
The institute is more optimistic than the government about current borrowing
trends. It expects a 1993-94 PSBR of Pounds 46bn, equivalent to 7 per cent
of GDP.
The institute, which advocates a Keynesian approach to economic policy, said
the present level of government borrowing was not excessive in the context
of the recent recession. Although it argues that only about 2.5 percentage
points of the 9 per cent deterioration in the PSBR/GDP ratio since 1988-89
can be directly attributed to the recession, the institute expects that
public finances will benefit from enhanced revenue and less need for social
security spending as the economy recovers.
Its main forecasts assume that UK short-term interest rates remain in a 5.5
per cent to 6.5 per cent range during the next two years before rising
again.
The institute sticks by the forecast of 2 per cent GDP growth for this year
which it first made last November. It has revised downwards its earlier
expectations of end-1993 retail prices inflation, excluding mortgage
interest payments, to about 3.5 per cent.
Looking ahead to next year, the institute expects consumer demand to
accelerate in spite of the prospect of higher taxes. The growth would be
based on a fall in unemployment from 2.91m at present to an average of 2.84m
in the fourth quarter of this year and 2.8m next year, an improved housing
market and increased personal wealth.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Resilient food prices raise RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL rise in the headline rate of inflation last month from 1.2 per
cent to 1.4 per cent was mainly because food prices fell by less than normal
for the time of year.
Last year the drop in food prices in July was exceptionally sharp whereas
this year the fall was 0.1 per cent.
Most fresh vegetables and home-killed lamb were cheaper but there were price
rises for milk, cereals, some biscuits and cakes. The 2.8 per cent fall in
seasonal food prices compared with June was the smallest for any July since
1983.
In spite of the relative resilience of food prices, a breakdown of the
retail prices index shows there are still strong deflationary pressures in
the economy and the July rate remained close to June's 30-year low of 1.2
per cent.
One of the main factors behind the low June figure was the early start to
summer sales. This appears to have continued into July in many sectors, with
shopkeepers fearing a large drop in demand if they raise prices.
For household goods, prices fell by 1.2 per cent compared with June,
reflecting widespread sale offers on furniture and electrical appliances.
There were increases, however, for pet foods.
Prices for clothing and footwear fell 3.5 per cent compared with June.
Clothes were only 0.4 per cent dearer than in the same month a year ago.
The combined June and July falls for household goods were the sharpest for
the time of year since 1956, and for clothing and footwear since 1914.
The only other component of the RPI in which prices fell on the month was
leisure goods. The Central Statistical Office said the 0.9 per cent
month-on-month fall reflected reductions in the prices of hi-fi equipment
and videos, as well as toys and newspapers.
Prices of household services rose by 1.1 per cent compared with June, partly
because of an end to special reductions for local 'cheap-rate' telephone
calls. There were also increases in some insurance premiums and trade union
subscriptions.
Housing costs rose a slim 0.1 per cent, reflecting a continuing rise in the
average outstanding mortgage debt. There was no change in mortgage interest
rates compared with a small fall in July last year.
Inflation may rise again this month. The CSO said prices of seasonal food
usually rise in August, although prices for fresh fruit and vegetables have
fluctuated widely in recent months. Further increases in pub beer prices are
also expected. As sales end, a recovery in prices of audio-visual equipment
is also likely.

FT  19 AUG 93 / MP hears tales of hard times: David Owen takes the political
temperature of Hereford's constituents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELDERLY countryman fishes a scrap of buff envelope out of his jacket
pocket and consults the list scribbled on the back.
'Now then, set-aside,' he says. 'That could be used to help wildlife a lot.'
He laments the declining number of redstarts, nightjars and nightingales in
his rural patch. It is the seventh topic he has broached in just 25 minutes
at Mr Colin Shepherd's Monday morning surgery.
The clubbable Tory MP's Hereford seat, which he has held for 19 years, is a
typical English shire constituency encompassing an ancient market town and
an extensive rural hinterland.
Comparatively prosperous but not unmarked by recession, its
agriculture-based industries such as chicken-processing and cider making are
supplemented by light engineering and high-tech enterprises.
As a place to take a snapshot of what is on voters' minds since parliament
began the summer recess, a visit to this week's surgery reveals that it is
not Maastricht, nor indeed Bosnia, that is most worrying people. Rather it
is how to make ends meet when money is tight.
A finely balanced argument over whether to build a Hereford bypass continues
to raise hackles after six years high on the agenda - the sort of tussle
between the environment and economic development that is familiar all over
the country.
The issue of the bypass has gained national significance after being chosen
as one of two schemes to be subjected to a form of 'round-table'
consultation as part of the government's plans to speed up the roadbuilding
programme.
The other old chestnut, which has returned to the front of people's minds
since the government embarked on its review of local government structures
in the English shires, is the strong local desire for Herefordshire to be
resurrected.
The county was grafted on to Worcestershire in the reorganisation of the
1970s, triggering widespread and lasting resentment. But Hereford and
Worcester is in only the fourth tranche of councils due for review under the
schedule designed by the government to give priority to areas with 'a
history of dissatisfaction' with existing arrangements.
Of the seven constituents who made the trip to the Conservative association
office - above a busy car dealership and across the road from a tombstone
engraver - most were seeking assistance with personal and specific problems.
There is a minimum of political point-scoring. The MP, diligently jotting
details into a carbon-papered notebook, acts essentially as a consultant
with the experience and standing to identify and secure the full attention
of those with the power to put matters right.
Three of the morning's appointees have housing problems, one has a query on
the eligibility of certain individuals for the social fund - which provides
loans and grants to the needy - and one is incensed about being refused
access to her place of birth by a foreign government.
A television dealer complains on his sheep-farming father's behalf about a
missing form from the Ministry of Agriculture.
It turns out he has much to get off his chest about 'useless' government
paperwork in general. His strength of feeling suggests that the government's
initiative to cut red tape may be popular if it can make significant
headway.
Then there is the elderly countryman. His copious list includes the
Herefordshire county issue, the extent to which the National Health Service
may be being 'bled' by high-charging suppliers, a proposal to tax caravans
and trailers, and several points about 'this bypass lark'.
He concludes by urging Mr Shepherd to 'export' British animal-rights
activists to discourage songbird hunters in southern Europe. 'I always think
it is a miracle when my housmartins come back every year on April 17,' the
MP patiently replies.
In spite of presiding over one of the Liberal Democrats' prime targets in
England, and a majority of less than 3,500, Mr Shepherd will probably be in
reasonably good spirits when Conservatives regroup for their party
conference in October, although he agrees that he would not want an election
tomorrow.
'The association in Hereford is in very good heart: money is coming in,
people are attending functions and support for John Major is good,' he says.
'If people don't like me, they are inclined to avert their eyes and walk
past me fairly smartly. There are times in every parliament when this
happens. The mood at the moment is not like that. It was a few months ago.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / Review of bus industry demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FULL review of the bus industry was called for yesterday by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission after it found another local bus company guilty of
anti-competitive behaviour designed to force a competitor out of the market.
There have been a number of instances of bus companies attempting to squeeze
rivals out of the market since deregulation. Most recently, in June the
commission found Southdown Motor Services guilty of trying to force a rival
off routes in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, by pitching fares at an uneconomic
level.
Responding to the commission's report on bus services in mid and west Kent,
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the government was not
yet convinced of the need for a wide-scale review.
But he said it would consider the commission's suggestions for tightening
the application of competition law to the bus industry.
The commission said the introduction by Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services
of additional bus services timed immediately before those of a competitor
was designed to force the competitor's withdrawal from the routes.
This behaviour, together with the use of selective fare reductions on
journeys immediately in front of a competitor's and other actions were
practices which operated, or were likely to operate, against the public
interest, the commission said.
The commission also examined M&amp;D's operation of the Chatham bus station and
found the terms on which it offered access to other bus companies
unreasonable, denying passengers a choice of services from the station.
Mr Hamilton said he had asked the director-general of fair trading to seek
undertakings within three months from M&amp;D that it would address the
commission's complaints.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Low prices hit recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY that buys waste newsprint in central Scotland for recycling has
told councils it can no longer afford to pay for the paper they collect,
because of low prices in the waste newsprint market.
Stirling Recycling, of Gartcosh, near Glasgow, is no longer paying for the
waste newsprint it takes from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Falkirk district
councils.
The councils collect old newspapers and magazines which local people have
put in recycling banks and pass them on to Stirling Recycling, which sells
them to newsprint processors.
Mr David Symmers, chief executive of the Independent Waste Paper Processors
Association, said: 'This sort of problem is happening all over Britain -
some companies are charging councils for taking the newsprint off them.
'The market is weak because Europe is flooded with surplus waste paper from
the subsidised German recycling system.'
The oversupply of waste newsprint in Britain and the increasing
unwillingness of the companies that take it to pay for it means that the
cost to local authorities of running newsprint recycling schemes will
escalate.
If Edinburgh District Council receives nothing from Stirling Recycling up to
the end of this financial year, it will forgo income of Pounds 26,000 - or
Pounds 10 per tonne - and still have to pay to collect the paper.
'It can cost companies up to Pounds 30 per tonne to collect, bale and clean
the waste newsprint,' said Mr Symmers. 'Yet they may only be getting Pounds
25 for selling it.'
Germany, where both producers and consumers are legally obliged to pay for
the recycling of waste paper and packaging, is blamed for flooding the
European market with surplus waste.
Other European Community countries are trying to persuade Germany to change
its recycling policies.
Mr Symmers said that the UK needed more plants such as the one proposed in
Aylesford by SCA Group and Mondi. 'We badly need one in Scotland,' he added.
A project spearheaded by North British Newsprint, part of Stirling
Recycling, to build a Pounds 220m recycled newsprint mill at Gartcosh has
been stalled since 1991 when Abitibi-Price, the Canadian paper company,
pulled out.
Mr Christopher Wilkins, chairman of North British Newsprint, said it would
review its plans for the plant in the light of events at Aylesford. 'The
project is fully developed and a major company is currently contributing
towards it,' he said. 'We are waiting for the appropriate time to start.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / Hopes revived for Pounds 250m paper plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY, PHILIP GAWITH and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, JOHANNESBURG, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBABILITY that a new Pounds 250m paper-making machine will be built in
Aylesford, Kent, rose yesterday. SCA Group, of Sweden, and Mondi Europe,
largely owned by South African interests, said they were in preliminary
talks over co-operating to build the machine.
The machine would be able to produce 280,000 tonnes of newsprint a year,
adding to capacity of 90,000 tonnes from an existing machine and providing
up to 100 new jobs.
A decision is expected this year so the machine could be commissioned by
mid-1995. It would use recycled fibre as raw material, and SCA plans to
increase its post-consumer waste collection system to provide 80 per cent of
the 400,000 tonnes of waste paper the mill would need each year.
SCA's Maybank subsidiary is already a large collector of pre-consumer waste
and has started 'paper banks' with local authorities.
The UK makes about 36 per cent of its annual requirement for newsprint -
close to 2m tonnes. Overcapacity in Europe and dumping from Canadian
producers have cut newsprint prices sharply in the past two years, leading
to losses for some European producers. Imports from Canada have begun to
recede, partly because demand in the US has picked up.
The new machine could increase UK production to nearer 50 per cent of
consumption. Its site is only 30 miles from London, the largest printing
centre in Europe. The project has already attracted a Pounds 20m government
grant.
SCA is one of the largest European paper groups. Mondi Europe, which has
invested in two Austrian paper companies, is owned by a consortium led by
Anglo American Corporation. The consortium also includes De Beers, Minorco
and Mondi Paper, a large newsprint producer in South Africa. The proportion
it could take from Aylesford is still under discussion. It would be likely
to pay for its share from funds it holds outside South Africa.
Mr Ulf Frolander, president of SCA Graphic Paper, said he expected some
recovery in the newsprint market by 1995, with capacity utilisation and
prices forecast to rise.
Plans for a new machine at the site, which is owned by SCA, were first
announced in 1989 when the mill was owned by Reedpack, the management
buy-out from Reed International. Reedpack was taken over by SCA in 1990. SCA
decided to bring in a partner to reduce its risk. Mr Frolander said that if
talks with Mondi did not succeed, SCA would seek another partner.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Gas companies reject price fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIVAL GAS companies yesterday attacked claims by British Gas that the
introduction of competition to the household supply market would mean higher
prices for large groups of customers.
'These statements are not true, but British Gas is scoring some good points
with them,' said Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of Utilicorp UK, which has
linked up with six regional electricity companies in order to enter the
domestic supply market.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended on Tuesday in two reports
on the gas industry that household customers be given a free choice of
supplier by 2002.
It also quoted in its reports figures by British Gas showing that prices for
1.4m of its customers using small amounts of gas would double in a free
market. A further 60 per cent of the company's 18m consumers could be worse
off.
The commission said that although prices could go up in the shorter term,
the introduction of competition would bring the prospect of price reduction
in the long run.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, denied allegations of
scaremongering. 'We've said all along the removal of the monopoly should
only take place after the government has given careful consideration to all
these issues,' he said.
Competitors disagree with claims that they will only be looking to
cherry-pick in a competitive market and supply the most profitable
customers.
Rival suppliers say they are already delivering gas to some high-volume
domestic customers who have seen savings of between 10 per cent and 12 per
cent.
Competitors are also annoyed at claims that prices will rise in a more
competitive market. They believe it could deter the government from opening
up household supplies.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Overseas companies win draft telecom licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has granted draft licences to three overseas companies to
offer telecommunications services in the UK.
The draft licences have been issued to Sprint, the third-largest
long-distance US operator; Telstra, the overseas arm of the Australian
national operator; and Worldcom, a London-based company owned by
Telecolombus of Switzerland and IDB of the US, both communications groups.
If confirmed, the licences will give the three carriers wide-ranging powers
to offer services on leased lines and over the public network.
The draft licences give the operators 'code powers' to construct facilities
in the UK, but they will not be allowed to offer international voice
telephony services using their own facilities.
The operators would also be allowed to operate 'international simple resale'
services, re-selling leased lines connected to the public network at both
ends, to Australia, Sweden and Canada.
The government's readiness to grant public telecommunications licences to
overseas companies marks a milestone in the development of competition in
the UK market.
Four large-scale licences have been issued since the 1991 duopoly review,
but none to an existing telecommunications operator.
Mr Phil Madden, Telstra's European business development manager, said that
the company would explore options 'ranging from having a physical 'backbone'
in the UK to leasing lines and using new wireless technology to provide
local connections'.
Mr Vincent Gargaro, chief executive of Sprint International Northern Europe,
said the licence, if granted, was 'only one milestone in a lot of things
that have got to happen before we can offer a service.'
Worldcom has been re-selling leased lines to business customers for nearly
two years. It has more than 100 customers, mainly in London.
American Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US operator, has a licence
application pending. If the three draft licences are granted, AT&amp;T's chances
of direct access to the UK market will improve.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Pit probe will focus on roof supports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL was expected to launch an inquiry today into the Bilsthorpe pit
accident, in which at least one miner died, with attention focused on the
mine's roof support, Michael Smith writes.
The roof bolting system on which the trapped miners were working at the
Nottinghamshire pit has been introduced gradually throughout British Coal
mines over the past decade in the face of strong opposition from the
National Union of Mineworkers.
British Coal said yesterday that roof bolting was more scientific and safer
than traditional methods.
The accident inquiry will involve British Coal, the mining inspectorate and
the mining unions.
Yesterday's accident happened on a section of mine where roof bolting is
being applied. British Coal said yesterday that the circumstances
surrounding the accident were unclear.
Roof bolting works in a similar way to a screw being driven into a wall
through a plug. A hole is driven into the roof. It is then packed with a
glue-type resin and a bolt is inserted. Roof bolts are placed about a metre
apart.
British Coal said virtually all its remaining mines used roof bolting,
although the system was not suitable for all parts of mines. Before roof
bolting, pit tunnels were held up with a system of steel arches and girders.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said yesterday that he was totally
against roof bolting as a primary support and had been campaigning against
it for many years.

THE FALL in pay rises appears to be bottoming out after hitting the lowest
levels since its surveys began in 1976, the Reward Group of independent pay
analysts said yesterday.
Mr Steve Flather, managing director of Reward, said: 'There is evidence that
we have reached the bottom for all main groups of employees.'
The latest survey finds the settlement level for clerical and manual workers
running at between 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent. However, taking into
account 'pay drift', mainly seniority increments and performance pay,
earnings increases for clerical workers were as high as 5.3 per cent in the
12 months to June 1993. In July the figure fell to 3.9 per cent. For a
director's secretary over the past year it was 5.5 per cent; 3.1 per cent
for a receptionist; 2.1 per cent for a clerk typist; and 5.8 per cent for
manual and skilled crafts workers.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Examiners asked if they make the grade: John Authers on
whether a rise in A-level passes means candidates are improving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EDUCATION community had hoped to take some credit for good news after a
troubled year.
But yesterday teachers and administrators were being asked whether the fifth
successive rise in the pass rate in A-level exams was because examination
candidates were improving or because examiners were making exams easier.
The National Union of Teachers dismissed the claim that standards had been
lowered as 'a hoary chestnut', while the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers had 'full confidence' that A-level examining boards were setting
papers which were 'as rigorous as ever'.
Dr William Lambert, convener of the GCE secretaries group which represents
the examination boards, said: 'Any improvement in the percentage of students
gaining these grades is due solely to improved performance on their part.'
The examinations were 'second to none in terms of quality control and
consistency of standards from year to year'.
A-levels have not always been intended as a measure of educational
standards. When they were developed after the war as the main examination
for university entrants in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, each board
was given a general guideline that the top 10 per cent of candidates would
receive an A grade, the next 15 per cent a B grade and so on.
This ranked candidates but said nothing about the standard of one year's
entrants compared with another's.
Also, a given grade might be easier to achieve from one examining board than
from another.
The boards now meet every three or four years to try to agree on uniform
standards.
But the table, compiled from the boards' reports by Mander Portman Woodward,
a group of independent sixth form colleges, shows that success rates
continue to vary widely.
In English Literature, where marking must be more subjective than in some
subjects, only 1.5 per cent fail with the Oxford and Cambridge board, while
25.6 per cent fail the Associated Examining Board's purely written syllabus.
Its more popular alter-native syllabus, which includes an element of teacher
assessment, has a failure rate of 6 per cent.
Similar, although smaller, disparities are noticeable in other subjects  -
for example, 9.1 per cent fail mathematics with Oxford and Cambridge,
compared with 33.5 per cent at the AEB.
Dr George Turnbull of the AEB says the differences are due to the boards'
customers. The Oxford and Cambridge board is popular with independent
schools, many of which are selective and could be expected to achieve higher
results. The AEB has traditional links with adult and further education.
The boards' standards are monitored by the Schools Examination and
Assessment Council, a government body which assesses two subjects each year.
The council enforces a more uniform standard than that achieved by different
universities for degrees.
Mr Joe Ruston, a director of Mander Portman Woodward, argues that there is a
need for a single examining board. 'The question is, how do you achieve
harmonisation between the boards unless by having one board for the whole
country?'
This year the government mounted an investigation of all A-level boards,
which should settle the question. The Office for Standards in Education,
which runs school inspection in England and Wales, expects to publish its
review in October.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Shell confirms talks on union derecognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL COMPANIES have been privately discussing union derecognition across the
British oil industry, it was confirmed yesterday by Shell UK.
But the company rejected a union accusation that the oil companies were in
'collusion' on a union-busting strategy. It said it was 'completely without
foundation'.
Mr Fred Higgs, the TGWU general union's officer for the oil industry, said
that Shell and other oil companies had met at a hotel in Stratford upon
Avon, Warwickshire, on March 5. Union derecognition had been discussed.
Their next meeting was due next month.
Shell UK in a written statement said that the Stratford meeting was 'one of
a series of informal get-togethers held twice a year, on average, for many
years'.
It added: 'Union derecognition was an item on the agenda of this meeting
along with a wide range of other issues such as quality management,
suggestion schemes and sickness monitoring.'
Last night Shell said: 'All companies with refineries in Britain are invited
to the meetings.'
Mr Higgs announced a national consumer boycott of Shell products sold at
filling stations in protest at the company's plan to derecognise the unions
at its Shell Haven refinery.
Shell expressed 'regret' at the union call for a boycott, adding that it was
'not helpful at the current time'.
It said: 'This will only exacerbate the already fragile situation at Shell
Haven.'
Its decision to derecognise the unions at the refinery had been 'motivated
by commercial considerations only', Shell said. 'The simple fact is that the
situation is so precarious that without a radical restructuring of all
working arrangements on the site, we would have no option but to consider
more drastic action.' This could have involved closing the refinery.
Shell said that the system of three separate unions at Shell Haven was to be
replaced by 'a simple and effective process of direct consultation between
employees and line managers'.
The company said it had 'no general policy of derecognition' and pointed out
that it continued to operate union agreements elsewhere in its refineries.
'All employees have and will continue to have the right to join a union of
their choice,' Shell said.
Mr Higgs said the unions had been willing to negotiate a new deal at Shell
Haven in line with Shell's policies. 'We have done this at the company's
Stanlow refinery,' he said.
Mr Higgs and Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman, will meet Shell
managers at the Shell Haven refinery today to discuss the issue.

FT  19 AUG 93 / EC steel shake-up 'overdue'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LORDS EC energy, industry and transport committee today rejects any
notion of 'national burden-sharing' in planned cuts to Europe's steelmaking
capacity.
In a strongly worded report the committee says large-scale restructuring of
the EC steel sector, which is suffering from chronic overcapacity and
recession, is long overdue.
It warns against state subsidies to support inefficient production and says:
'There is a real danger that efficient private firms such as British Steel .
. . will suffer at the expense of inefficient state firms such as the
bankrupt Ilva in Italy.'
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman of British Steel, has argued that continental
steelmakers should reduce overcapacity to match the heavy cuts made in the
UK.
The committee's report comes at a sensitive time for the EC steel industry.
More than 30m tonnes of crude steel capacity have been recommended for
closure, leading to an estimated 70,000 job cuts.
The committee says British Steel does not expect to participate in the
current closures but the UK government has not ruled out further cuts.
It says competitive forces should be allowed to determine the future
structure and location of the industry, but expresses concern about the
human costs of closures.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Regional Jet orders give Shorts Pounds 70m
boost

<TEXT>
SHORTS, the Belfast subsidiary of Canada's Bombardier, has won up to Pounds
70m of fuselage work for the Canadair Regional Jet aircraft following this
week's announcement of two big orders from Air Canada and Utah-based SkyWest
Airlines.
Air Canada has ordered 24 50-seat Regional Jets from Bombardier worth more
than CDollars 400m (Pounds 205m), with deliveries stretched from May 1994 to
June 1996. The airline has taken options on another 24 aircraft.
SkyWest, a Delta Air Lines connector, said it had placed a USDollars 170m
(Pounds 114m) order for 10 Regional Jets with a further 10 options.
Deliveries are due to start in January.
If the options are taken up it could mean three years' work for Shorts on
the jet programme.
Since its acquisition by Bombardier in 1989, Shorts has doubled turnover,
increased jobs and turned losses into significant profits. It will soon
begin making the complete fuselage of the Learjet 45.
Air Canada has offered to buy rival Canadian Airlines' international
business for CDollars 200m and assume CDollars 800m of debt and lease
obligations for three 747-400s and five 767s, Robert Gibbens reports.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian Airlines and its parent PWA, labelled
the offer 'outrageous'.

<TEXT>
NORWAY will be holding a series of talks with US government officials
through September in an effort to avoid US trade sanctions, writes Karen
Fossli in Oslo.
Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, this month made an official
recommendation that Norway's decision to resume hunting minke whales in
defiance of the International Whaling Commission moratorium undermined the
effectiveness of the IWC's conservation regime.
Under a provision of US fishing law, the Pelly amendment, such a step gives
President Bill Clinton the authority to impose trade sanctions against the
offending country. Sanctions could be aimed at US imports of Norwegian
fishery products, valued at between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100m (Pounds
67.1m) a year.
Norway's whalers ended their hunt last month, falling four short of a
government-set quota of 160 minke whales. In autumn they will resume for
scientific purposes.

Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada chairman, said the offer would bring stability
to Canada's airline industry, providing one viable international carrier
while preserving Canadian Airlines as a domestic and North American carrier.
Both companies would be strengthened, he said. 'Together we could create
jobs and avoid the import of management control.'
Mr Harris said that under the offer Air Canada would take over Canadian's
international cockpit and cabin crews. It would get Canadian's Asian and

mainland China.
He ruled out a complete merger.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Airlines set to lose Dollars 2bn this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S airlines will lose another Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) this year
in spite of a steady recovery in passenger traffic, Mr Pierre Jeanniot,
director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said
yesterday.
This is a sharp improvement on last year's Dollars 4.8bn loss but will bring
the total lost by the world's airlines to Dollars 13.5bn over the past four
years.
The forecast will add to the pressures facing the administration of
President Bill Clinton to act on airline losses. A US commission is
scheduled today to submit a report on ways 'to ensure a strong competitive
airline industry'.
Mr Jeanniot blamed governments for the 'sorry state' of the airline
industry.
'Some governments, particularly in North America and Europe, have confused
deregulation or liberalisation with laissez-faire,' said Mr Jeanniot, a
former president of Air Canada. He attacked the imposition of fuel taxes, as
planned by President Clinton's administration, and said governments should
consider measures such as guaranteeing loans to troubled carriers.
He conceded that the airlines had contributed to their problems by adding
too much capacity in the face of limited demand.
Capacity on airlines rose 7 per cent in the first half of 1993, while
traffic grew at only 6 per cent, according to Iata figures.
'There is 4 per cent more over-capacity now than four years ago,' said Mr
Tom Murphy, a senior director at Iata. 'That's the equivalent of more than
400 Boeing 747s flying empty across the Atlantic Ocean every day.' The
over-capacity was likely to fall slowly and airlines would not return to
significant profits until 1995, said Mr Jeanniot.
The latest figures from Iata indicate the slowness of recovery in demand.
The first half of 1993 saw a further decline in companies' travel budgets.
Surveys of business travellers show that 28 per cent have seen budgets cut
this year.
This year's response to lower budgets is to travel less; last year, the
tendency was to buy a cheaper ticket.
However, Mr Jeanniot said that when the upturn came airlines would recover
quickly.
'Fuel prices and interest rates are about as low as they have ever been - we
should be making a lot of money right now. We have been passing on
productivity improvements to passengers. We must hang on to them for a few
years. Fares don't have to go up.'
Mr Jeanniot said there were still obstacles to further productivity gains.
Airports and the world's air traffic control networks, for example, had not
improved efficiency as much as the airlines. Airlines paid Dollars 12bn in
airport fees and air traffic control charges in 1991. Total revenues that
year were more than Dollars 200bn.
He said recovery was also being inhibited by the uncertainty of future
government regulations.
As well as the US commission, the industry is being studied by a European
Community comite des sages (committee of wise men), the EC council of
transport ministers and the OECD.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S trade with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has
undergone an extraordinary upheaval in the past four years, with a complete
switch from east to west Germany as the main source of exports and market
for imports.
A new report compiled by the Institute for the German Economy (IW) in
Cologne shows how the external trade ties of east Germany collapsed after
the Comecon trade bloc was effectively wound up in 1990/91, and how west
German industry moved in to fill the gap.
Between 1989 and 1992, east German exports to eastern and central Europe
fell overall by more than 75 per cent, from almost DM29bn (Pounds 11.5bn) to
just DM7bn. In the same period, west Germany pushed up its sales from
DM24.4bn to DM30.1bn, an increase of some 23 per cent.
East Germany's ailing enterprises were hit not only by the switch into hard
currency pricing, but also by a clear preference in eastern Europe for west
German products, according to the IW report.
The east Germans also proved unable to switch from state-trading relations
to competitive export marketing.
More than 51 per cent of west Germany's exports to eastern Europe consists
of investment goods and equipment, including machinery, vehicles and
electrical products.
However, western exports, and imports, have been boosted by the trend
towards the processing of German products under contract in the cheaper wage
economies of eastern Europe.
Eastern Germany, on the other hand, retained much more traditional emphasis
on raw materials and agricultural products in its exports.
Overall, Germany's exports to eastern and central Europe still fell - by
some 30 per cent - between 1989 and 1992, while its combined imports fell by
nearly 23 per cent.
Trade with the two parts of the former Czechoslovakia has grown dramatically
with west Germany. German exports were up 172.5 per cent, and imports up
nearly 166 per cent.
East German exports to the former Czechoslovakia fell less than to other
parts of eastern Europe, down a mere 79 per cent in the period.

business community. Only a few days ago Mr Jorge Marshall, the economics
minister, was obliged to deny publicly that the country was in danger of
slipping into recession.
But there are signs that the world economic downturn is starting to catch up
with Chile, which registered a 10.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product
last year and which has seen growth averaging 7 per cent since 1987.
'For a while there may have been a feeling that Chile could defy gravity,'
said one western diplomat. 'But now there is a consistent picture of
unambiguous deceleration.'
Such deceleration, which comes in spite of estimated 7-7.5 per cent growth
in the first six months of this year, is most clearly marked in Chile's
balance of trade position. This year the central bank is predicting a
Dollars 500m (Pounds 335.5m) trade deficit, the first in 12 years, as the
price of commodity exports slips and imports remain strong.
In the first half of the year Chile recorded a Dollars 112m trade deficit,
with exports down 4.1 per cent and imports up 19.3 per cent on the same
period of 1992.
Private economists predict that the current account deficit, which amounted
to Dollars 583m last year, will widen in 1993 to Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.2bn,
or up to 5.5 per cent of GDP. However, most observers believe the country,
which has Dollars 9.9bn in foreign exchange reserves and continues to
attract healthy capital inflows, can sustain such deficits for a few years,
but not indefinitely.
The first six months of 1993 has seen a sharp deterioration in prices for
Chile's main exports.
The price of copper, which accounts for more than 30 per cent of export
revenue, is likely to average considerably less than the government's budget
estimate of 96 US cents a pound.
Given that every one cent slide in the copper price costs the Treasury
Dollars 22m, Chile would 'lose' about Dollars 200m at current prices. It is
a measure of the country's fiscal prudence that at least Dollars 100m of
this will be met from a Dollars 800m copper stabilisation fund accumulated
since 1988.
Other commodities have also suffered. The price of fishmeal has been
affected by a rapid expansion of Peruvian production, while that of
cellulose has slipped because of overcapacity and competition from recycled
paper. Fruit growers, whose penetration of world markets has typified the
country's dynamic export performance, claim that the European Community's
restrictions on Chilean apples have cost the economy at least Dollars 100m.
In all, economists estimate that, barring a sharp recovery in commodity
prices, the country is likely to suffer a 'terms-of-trade shock' this year
equivalent to 2-3 per cent of GDP.
However, non-traditional exports such as salmon, wine and mining equipment
surged by 10 per cent in the first six months, a sign of continued export
diversification. The strong performance of such sectors adds weight to those
who argue that Chile's economy, which underwent wholesale restructuring
through the 1980s, is in a good position to weather the fleeting storm of
low commodity prices.
Although imports in general continue to grow, those of consumer goods are
slowing. Consumer imports in the first half of this year, at Dollars 945m,
were 14.5 per cent down on the second half of 1992. One economist called
this 'welcome and necessary'.
Imports of capital goods, on the other hand, were worth Dollars 1.6bn in the
six months to June, against Dollars 1.2bn in the same period of last year.
This suggests that levels of investment, and therefore the prospects for
future growth, remain healthy.
'In terms of investment we can be satisfied,' said Mr Alejandro Foxley, the
finance minister.
Government officials say that most fundamentals remain healthy. Inflation,
at about 12 per cent, is in check while the peso, which has been
appreciating steadily to the detriment of exporters, appears to be
stabilising and may even edge down slightly.  Interest rates, which have
been relatively high this year, are also likely to come down.
The government appears to be keeping a tight rein on spending, in spite of
pressures to relax controls ahead of presidential elections in December. The
Finance Ministry projects a Dollars 500m balance of payments surplus this
year.
Mr Armen Kouyoumdjian, an economic consultant, still rates Chile's economy
as the 'healthiest in the region'.
Mr Foxley sees no cause for concern. 'One has to remember that the economy
is going to grow by 6 per cent this year, that the rate of unemployment in
Santiago is below 4 per cent for the first time in 30 years, and that we
have record public and private investment as well as falling inflation.'
There nevertheless remains the nagging worry that Chile, the self-styled
'dragon' of Latin America, may be running out of puff. As one diplomat put
it: 'We're too close to the top to be able to see the bottom clearly.'
He is one of the many observers who expects Chile to pull off a 'soft
landing,' but warns it is too early to tell for certain.

<TEXT>
THE insurance industry's opposition to Proposition 103, the 'insurance
revolt initiative' passed by California voters in 1988, is starting to
crumble.
Allstate Insurance, one of the largest providers of property and casualty
insurance in California, has agreed to pay policyholders Dollars 110m
(Pounds 74m) in rebates on home and car insurance premiums, complying with
the demands of state regulators.
The agreement with Mr John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, ends
Allstate's five-year legal battle over implementation of Proposition 103.
The California law sparked moves in several other states to bring soaring
car, home and commercial insurance costs under state control.
Allstate has been in the forefront of the industry's legal battles against
Proposition 103, which required insurers to cut 1989 premiums to 20 per cent
below 1988 levels and submit all subsequent rate increases to state
regulators for approval. Allstate and other insurers have insisted that
their rates are fair and that they could not afford to pay rebates. However,
announcing the settlement on Tuesday, the insurance company said it wanted
to move forward after spending about Dollars 2m on litigation.
Refunds will be paid to Allstate's customers in California who purchased
policies in 1989. The Dollars 110m refund represents 5.3 per cent of the
Dollars 2bn in premiums collected by the company that year.
The surprise settlement is a significant achievement for Mr Garamendi, who
is widely expected to be a candidate for state governor in next year's
election. The agreement 'sends a strong signal to other insurers,' Mr
Garamendi said.
However, Mr Harvey Rosenfield, Proposition 103 author, accused the insurance
commissioner of offering 'discounts' to insurance companies willing to
settle the rebate issue. Allstate had originally been ordered to pay Dollars
244m in rebates, he said.
To date about a dozen smaller insurers have agreed to pay a total of Dollars
725m in rebates to their 7m customers in California. However, State Farm,
the state's largest insurer, is continuing its legal fight against
Proposition 103.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Explosion unearths chipmakers' fears - New
concerns over price increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW in the world semiconductor industry had heard of the chemical plant in
Niihama, a coastal city in western Japan, until it blew up last month. As
the dust settled it emerged that the site produced 60 per cent of world
requirements for a type of epoxy resin used to seal chips.
Sumitomo Chemical, owner of the plant, said yesterday that half its capacity
should be restored by the end of the year. This partially allayed anxieties
in the industry of a severe shortfall in supply of the material at a time
when semiconductor demand, particularly in the US, is strong.
But it has not been able to quell concerns that Sumitomo's dominance of the
epoxy resin market leaves chipmakers vulnerable - not so much to another
explosion, but to price increases. Sumitomo had been trying to raise prices
of epoxy resins since April, and the company yesterday said it would
continue to press for an increase.
There were two main reasons why the semiconductor industry was in the dark
about Sumitomo's importance as a supplier. First, epoxy resin producers sell
their product not directly to the industry but to compound makers who
provide the finished substance.
Second, the number of suppliers has shrunk relatively recently, with makers
such as Dow Chemical of the US leaving the market. Chipmakers argue Sumitomo
had gained its position in the past few years through aggressive pricing.
The strategy, to buy market share and then boost its prices, may have been
in its final stage when the blast occurred.
The chemical makers in turn blame the semiconductor industry for the
razor-thin margins which the materials carry, saying that it has held down
suppliers' prices to control costs during its cyclical downturn. Sumitomo
itself says that its epoxy resin operations, with Y6bn (Pounds 37.8m) annual
sales, were in the red. However, NEC, another leading Japanese electronics
group, insists that Sumitomo's marketing policy was partly responsible for
the low profitability of the epoxy resin business. 'They came into the
market with very cheap prices to increase market share,' said one official.
An official at a US chemical company agreed that Sumitomo, which entered the
market in the early 1980s, had destroyed the pricing structure for epoxy
resin. Japan's Fair Trade Commission bans unfair price reductions which
erode profits and drive competitors out of the market. But the FTC insists
that it found no problem with Sumitomo's case.
Semiconductor makers have started to look at ways to reduce the use of
epoxy. NEC says it is experimenting with other substances such as the
ceramics which some producers use, while Toshiba is trying to cut down the
size of the semiconductor itself.
The case has also flushed out the exposure of the semiconductor industry to
one or two suppliers controlling other crucial substances. Tanaka Kikinzoku,
a specialist metals company, produces an estimated 70 per cent of the wire
bonding for semiconductors while Tokyo Ohka Kogyo has a 30 per cent market
share for photoresists, another component.
Sumitomo has meanwhile acted to restore 50 to 60 per cent of its usual epoxy
resin output from next month through arrangements with Nippon Kayaku and
Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, the country's other two significant producers
of epoxy, as well as with Chang Chun Plastics of Taiwan. They are boosting
output through the use of spare capacity, technological assistance from
Sumitomo, and adding production lines.
These moves have themselves given rise to fears that relationships among the
suppliers are becoming more cosy. By next year Sumitomo should have regained
its market leadership and may be in a position to dictate a mutually
beneficial new pricing policy.
The market for the type of epoxy resin used in semiconductors is difficult
to enter for other reasons. Purity requirements are high, and the first
three months' output from any new facility is on trial and can be rejected
by users on quality grounds.
Dow, which moth-balled its Texas plant in 1991, would be subject to the same
vetting if it reopened. It was unwilling to do this unless Sumitomo
guaranteed a market for the first five years of its output. The two are said
to have discussed the possibility but such a commitment appeared too
long-term for Sumitomo to find palatable.
The Japanese company said yesterday that it intended to have annual
production capacity of 5,500 tonnes by the end of the year by restarting one
of two lines at a cost of more than Y1.4bn.

FT  19 AUG 93 / World Bank move on plan to monitor projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank board will meet next week to discuss proposals for setting up
an inspection panel to review complaints about projects from executive
directors or outside groups.
But the draft paper circulated to directors before the meeting suggests a
modest unit with an annual budget of only Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 402,700)
and a single permanent, though not necessarily full-time, staff member.
The suggested annual budget is almost exactly half of that required for a
single independent commission set up under Mr Bradford Morse, former
administrator of the United Nations Development Project, to investigate the
World Bank-funded Narmada dam project in India.
The furore over Narmada was a driving force behind many World Bank
directors' desire to set up some form of inspection panel.
Criticism of the draft paper, especially from environmental groups which
have led the battle against projects such as Narmada, focuses on the limits
proposed on the panel's independence, on the restricted scope of complaints
it could investigate, and on the publication of the panel's verdict.
Complaints could be brought either by any four executive directors or by a
directly affected third party, but in the latter case the board would decide
whether to proceed with an investigation.
Environmentalist groups also complain that investigations would be limited
to violations of the World Bank's own policies, rules and procedures. They
would not be allowed for violations by a borrower country of its loan
agreements with the World Bank.
In most cases, critics of the paper argue, the bank follows procedures in
drawing up its loan agreements, insisting on very adequate environmental and
human rights safeguards; the problem arises when those safeguards are not
put into effect by the borrower.
A further criticism is the draft paper's proposal that the panel's judgement
should only be released to the complainant after the World Bank board had
already taken a decision on what to do about it, too late for the
complainant to have any input into the remedy.
A separate draft paper on expanding the disclosure of World Bank
information, is also due to be discussed but is at a more advanced stage,
and could be concluded that day. The inspection panel document is likely to
be reworked and concluded shortly before the bank's annual meeting at the
end of next month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY will be holding a series of talks with US government officials
through September in an effort to avoid US trade sanctions, writes Karen
Fossli in Oslo.
Earlier this month, Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, made an official
recommendation that Norway's decision to resume hunting minke whales in
defiance of the International Whaling Commission moratorium undermined the
effectiveness of the IWC's conservation regime.
Under a provision of US fishing law, called the Pelly amendment, such a step
gives President Bill Clinton the authority to impose trade sanctions against
the offending country, without limit to any amount or kind of product.
Sanctions are expected to be aimed at US imports of Norwegian fishery
products, valued at between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100m a year.
Mr Clinton has to make a decision on sanctions against Norway by October 6,
according to Norwegian officials.
The IWC voted in May to continue the moratorium on all commercial whaling
despite a recommendation by its scientific committee for a limited
harvesting of the minke whale.
Norway's whalers completed their hunt last month falling four short of a
commercial quota of 160 minke whales set by the government. In autumn they
will resume whaling for scientific purposes.

FT  19 AUG 93 / China promotes inland development zones
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has launched a drive to promote economic development zones in its
inland regions to narrow the gap between the struggling hinterland and
relatively prosperous coastal areas.
Mr Liu Peiqiang, a senior official of China's State Council, or cabinet,
said the government aimed to provide an economic boost for areas that had
lagged behind the south and other regions in the scramble for investment
funds.
The authorities recently clamped down on the unrestrained spread of
development zones in coastal regions - these zones offer generous tax breaks
 -in an effort to re-direct investment elsewhere.
A widening income gap between coastal and inland areas has begun to cause
political problems. It has also resulted in a mass migration of people from
China's hinterland to areas of opportunity, especially in southern China
where the economic boom has been most pronounced.
The State Council has approved 30 development zones across the country, but
provincial and local governments have sought to develop thousands of such
areas in a scramble for investment funds. The authorities in Beijing have
disallowed most of these proposed zones in a nationwide clampdown.
Mr Liu indicated that provincial capitals would be a favoured location for
new development zones whose purpose is to attract foreign investment in
processing and high-tech industries.
South Korea yesterday began work on a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m) industrial
park for South Korean industry near the city of Tianjin, 130km east of
Beijing.
The site is being developed by the Korea Land Development Corporation, which
is partly owned by the South Korean Construction Ministry.
It will be the South Korean government's largest investment in China since
diplomatic relations were established last year. Two-way trade is expected
to reach Dollars 13bn, making China South Korea's third largest trade
partner.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Subic Bay finds new role as an industrial base: Jose Galang
reports companies value the facilities left by US forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBIC, the former US naval base in the Philippines that is being transformed
into an industrial zone, is slowly living up to hopes that it will become a
magnet for foreign investment.
Nearly nine months after the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) took
over from the American forces, the facility has attracted nearly 20
projects, involving total investments of more than Dollars 307m (Pounds
207m). The authority says it has had a further 2,000 inquiries.
It is not difficult to appreciate Subic's potentials. The US forces left the
area in November last year with well-paved roads, a telecommunications
system, an airport, power-generating plants, and water and sewerage systems.
Having played a strategic role in US naval operations, Subic's natural
deep-water harbour, well-maintained piers and berthing areas, could provide
a transshipment centre for companies aiming for the Asia-Pacific markets.
All that makes Subic ideal for enterprises that want to start up quickly.
Incentives offered to investors are also among the most generous in the
region: a 5 per cent tax on gross income in lieu of all national and local
taxes, no controls on foreign exchange, and free flow of goods and capital
within the zone as a separate customs territory.
And yet just over a month ago the outlook for Subic was very bleak indeed. A
June 10 executive order issued by Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president,
limited exemptions from import taxes and duties to raw materials and
equipment being brought into Subic. Consumer goods, under the Ramos order,
were to suffer the usual levies.
The sudden change in policy, lamented as a violation of the spirit of Subic
as a 'special economic and free port zone', caught not only the investors by
surprise but also the SBMA officials. Apparently the Ramos order was drafted
by his legal adviser without consulting SBMA executives.
Decrying the change of rules midstream, large investors at the industrial
estate threatened to withdraw. Mr Ramos eventually amended his directive and
granted duty-free import of consumer goods provided the items were consumed
within the zone.
The Philippine Supreme Court then ruled as unconstitutional the appointment
of Mr Richard Gordon as the SBMA chairman. Mr Gordon was also mayor of
Olongapo City, where the Subic zone is located, and the court said
individuals were barred by the charter from holding two government posts.
Mr Gordon, who was in Japan selling the Subic zone to prospective investors
when the Supreme Court ruling was handed down, initially chose to stay with
his Olongapo constituents. However, after being urged by Mr Ramos to
'consider the bigger and broader interests of the country', he opted to stay
on at SBMA.
Although quickly resolved, these anxious episodes typify, analysts say, the
travails of doing business in the Philippines. Sudden changes in state
policy, even while a new enterprise is still groping its way around, are not
new to local investors. This pattern took hold during the martial law
administration in the late 1970s, with many of the policy changes proving
favourable to business groups close to the government.
If the Philippines is to get its economy on track for sustained growth and
finally keep in step with its high-growth neighbours, analysts say, stable
and even rules must apply. Subic may have awakened the 14-month-old Ramos
administration to that necessity.
Last week Mr Gordon finalised a Dollars 60m loan agreement with the Taiwan
government for the development of a 300-hectare area within the Subic zone
that will be exclusively for Taiwan industries.
SBMA officials had earlier estimated that some 700 light and medium
industries, all seeking to market their produce to various markets in the
region, would locate operations at Subic. At the loan signing ceremonies in
Taipei last week, however, officials were saying that only 30 companies had
so far shown interest.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Yen's rise likely to speed deregulation: Reform would help
public benefit from currency's surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE renewed surge of the yen brought signs yesterday that the Japanese
government was preparing to speed up market reform in an attempt to boost
the sagging Japanese economy and cut the high trade surplus.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, has indicated that the structural
reform of Japan's markets would be discussed when ministers meet today for
emergency talks on the economic situation.
The government believes measures such as the deregulation of markets would
not only help pass on the benefits of the high yen to the public but also
deflect foreign criticism that Japan's closed market is keeping its surplus
high.
The yen's latest sharp rise is attributed to a combination of factors:
Yen buying by institutional investors who expect a reduction in the official
discount rate from 2.50 per cent to 2.0 per cent to improve prospects for
Japanese bonds and equ-ities.
Speculative money fleeing from European currencies into the relatively safe
haven of the Japanese yen. The return of relative stability to Japanese
politics has heightened the view of the yen as a safe currency.
Falling Japanese investment flows to overseas markets, which have reduced
demand for dollars.
Loss-cutting selling by Japanese exporters and investors in currencies
against which the yen has risen, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars
and European currencies, which has affected the yen-dollar rate as well.
Behind all these moves is a spreading belief that the yen will continue to
rise until the US is convinced that Japan is serious about reducing its
trade surplus.
Comments last Friday by Mr Walter Mondale, the newly appointed US ambassador
to Japan, that he considered correcting the bilateral trade imbalance an
urgent priority have revived the view that the US may use the threat of a
strong yen to goad the Japanese government into action.
The yen's initial rapid rise earlier this year was similarly triggered by
comments by US government officials suggesting the Clinton administration
wanted a stronger yen. 'There is a perception that the US has no intention
of supporting the dollar,' says Mr Masayuki Takaura, chief of dollar-yen
dealing at Sanwa Bank in Tokyo.
The situation has caught the just-formed Japanese government in a bind.
The US government wants Japan to reduce its current account surplus
substantially by stimulating the domestic economy through fiscal measures,
such as an income tax cut.
However, the coalition government under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has
publicly stated that, due to the difficult financial situation the
government faces amid the recession, it is not prepared to reduce income
taxes immediately.
Nor is the government inclined to cover the shortfall in revenue by issuing
deficit bonds.
Although the US and Japan are to begin official talks next month within a
new framework for discussing bilateral trade and economic issues, there are
no indications so far that differences on how to tackle the trade imbalance
can be resolved.
Many traders agree that in the long term the current level of the yen-dollar
exchange rate is not sustainable, since it does not reflect economic
fundamentals.
But they also believe the yen's rising trend is unlikely to be quickly
reversed, unless the US changes its policy stance or unless Mr Hosokawa's
government sends a strong signal that it is prepared to tackle the surplus
in a way that would satisfy the US.
A cut in the discount rate is unlikely to do the trick, say traders. 'That
would not have such a major impact because the US is demanding fiscal
measures to stimulate domestic demand,' Mr Takaura says.
Until the Japanese government can convince the US that whatever measures it
adopts will be as effective in reducing the trade surplus as an income tax
cut, it will continue to face the prospect of a relentlessly rising yen.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Hussein's poll law seeks curb on Islamists: Brotherhood may
contest law's legality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN'S announcement of a new electoral law this week is a clear
demonstration of the extent of his alarm at the rise in popularity of
Islamic politics in Jordan.
The new law, despite almost unanimous opposition from the country's
fledgling political parties and members of parliament, is likely to be a
serious blow to the Islamists' aspirations.
Under the previous system, the number of votes cast by a voter was
determined by the number of seats in a constituency: a system which was
widely held to favour large groups, such as the Islamists, able to field
many candidates in each constituency. But the change will mean that the
elections due on November 8 will be conducted on a one-person, one-vote
basis.
It is thought the government's prime motive is to cut the seats held by
Moslem fundamentalists in the new parliament. At the last elections in 1989,
fundamentalists won 30 out of 80 seats.
Inevitably, fundamentalist reaction to the change has been condemnation. The
Islamic Action Front (IAF), political wing of the powerful Moslem
Brotherhood, is threatening to contest the legality of the new law, perhaps
boycotting the elections altogether. It says parliament was dissolved by the
king before the new law was issued to avoid debate and the risk of
non-ratification.
Such threats are probably more a matter of form than an effort to bring
about a head-on confrontation with the government.
The Islamists have until now been successful under Jordan's political
system. Historically, the Moslem Brotherhood was favoured by the king as a
counterbalance to the Arab nationalist and socialist parties, such as the
Nasserites and Baathists, which were banned in 1957 following a coup
attempt.
The fact that they were allowed to develop while other parties were banned
was part of the reason for their success at the last elections. The
Brotherhood's organisation and social influence were well established, while
other political parties were legalised only last year.
However, in the last parliament, the fundamentalists rigorously pursued
their aim of Islamicising the state.
Draft laws, calling for the segregation of sexes at public swimming baths,
health clubs, schools and universities, and an alcohol ban were never
actually passed, but, together with calls to abandon peace talks with
Israel, they caused great anxiety for the government.
In announcing the new election law, the king urged fundamentalists to live
up to their responsibilities and not 'undermine or distort Islam'.
But unlike Algeria and Egypt, there is little evidence of Islamic militancy
in Jordan - despite a trial due this month of 10 fundamentalists charged
with plotting to assassinate the king in June.
Generally the fundamentalists work within the mainstream of politics. As
elsewhere, their support is based on easing economic deprivation and
providing social welfare to the poor and needy.
Outside mosques in Amman on a Friday, the Moslem Brotherhood can be seen
distributing subsidised food and clothes. It also runs hospitals and
schools.
The Brotherhood is believed to have substantially more financial resources
than other parties. But the source of funding is something of a mystery.
Collections are made at mosques, and money from abroad, particularly Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and Iran, is said to boost its finances considerably.
Whether the latest announcement will subdue the Islamists remains to be
seen. But their presence will not go away. The king will have to maintain
tight control if he is to preserve the kingdom's democracy on his terms.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN President Lee Teng-hui, fending off a challenge from dissidents in
his ruling Kuomintang or Nationalist party, yesterday won another four-year
term as party chairman, Reuter reports from Taipei.
'Our party is today moving towards more democracy and modernisation,
creating a new beginning in the party's history,' Mr Lee told the party
congress after his victory.
In the first election by secret ballot for the post in the Nationalists'
99-year history, Mr Lee gained the votes of 1,686 delegates at the party's
14th congress.
But in a sign of unprecedented dissent among the Nationalists, 357 spoiled
ballots were cast. Rebel delegates opposing Mr Lee, accusing him of delaying
internal party reforms and failing to halt corruption, said they cast
spoiled votes.
No one ran against him. Dissidents cancelled plans to field their own
candidate after Mr Lee pushed through some internal reforms demanded by the
rebels.
These included the creation of four new posts, for party vice-chairmen, and
the new procedure for selecting the chairman.
'The elections for chairman were undemocratic. It is an inglorious victory
for Mr Lee. We did not field a candidate because there was too much pressure
on us,' said Mr Feng Hu-hsiang, spokesman for the rebel faction.
In a conciliatory gesture towards the rebels, Mr Lee yesterday named Mr Hau
Pei-tsun, a former premier ousted by the party's mainstream faction in
February, and judicial branch chief Mr Lin Yang-kang as two of the
vice-chairmen.
The other two are Taiwan Vice-President Li Yuan-zu and Premier Lien Chan -
close political allies of Mr Lee.
Mr Lee, 70, became chairman at the last party congress in 1988. He has
presided over a series of democratic reforms which began when his
predecessor, the late president Chiang Ching-kuo, lifted martial law in
1987.
He has also engineered a gradual easing of tensions with China, over which
the Nationalists have claimed sovereignty since they lost the civil war and
fled to Taiwan in 1949.
But Mr Lee's reforms opened the way for the Nationalists' unity, once
maintained through iron discipline, to crumble. He now faces a difficult
task in trying to heal deep internal divisions which have become the most
serious threat to the Nationalists' grip on power in four decades.
The Nationalists suffered a blow last week when a group of rebel legislators
broke away to form their own party - the first formal split among the
Nationalists since 1949.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Hassan al-Alfi, Egypt's minister of the interior, was seriously
injured and four people killed yesterday in a bomb attack on his car in
central Cairo.
It was the latest in a wave of terrorist attacks on senior officials and
tourist facilities during the past 18 months and was presumed to be the work
of Islamic extremists.
The blast came as the minister's car was within 500 metres of the Interior
Ministry. Initially it was reported that gunmen had also opened fire on the
motorcade, but this was later denied when it became known that the bomb had
been packed with ball bearings.
The area of the attack, close to the US embassy and Tahrir Square, was
quickly sealed off by riot police and armoured personnel carriers.
A woman who witnessed the blast said the minister was taken to hospital in a
van which happened to be passing the scene.
Gen Alfi, who took office only four months ago, has vowed to pursue a tough
line against the terrorists. His predecessor, Mr Abdul Halim Moussa, was
removed from the post for reportedly having sought to open a dialogue with
militant Islamic groups.
The determination of President Hosni Mubarak's government to respond harshly
to the extremist threat has been brought home over the past two months by
the execution of 15 convicted terrorists.
Mr Mubarak has accused Iran of being behind the efforts to destabilise his
regime.
Mr Safwat al-Sherif, the minister of information, narrowly escaped an
assassination attempt in April, and earlier this week gunmen opened fire on
a Nile cruise ship carrying British tourists.

THE Bank of Japan has no plans to cut the official discount rate, despite
the yen's sharp rise against the dollar, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank's
governor, said yesterday.
'The mechanism for economic recovery is in place,' Mr Mieno said. The Bank
did not consider that the Japanese economy had hit bottom yet, Mr Mieno
said, but neither did it see any grounds to change its view that the economy
would pick up in the latter half of the fiscal year.
While consumer spending and private capital investment remained sluggish,
recent progress in stock adjustment and past fiscal and monetary measures
were providing the fundamental conditions for recovery, he said.
Mr Mieno's remarks came amid widespread expectations of an easing of
monetary policy to stimulate Japan's still weak domestic economy and help
curb the recent sharp rise of the yen.
The currency's movement has been largely attributed to speculation on the
markets that the US sees a higher yen as a means of reducing Japan's trade
surplus.
The yen took a breather on the markets yesterday, trading in a narrow range
between Y101.32 and Y101.70 against the dollar, as market traders waited for
further developments to give them direction.
Its future movements will depend largely on what, if any, specific measures
the Japanese government comes up with today, at the emergency meeting of
ministers, to address the country's high surplus.
Businesses and economists alike have been calling for a substantial
reduction in the discount rate to provide a psychological boost to
corporations, help stimluate the domestic economy and send a clear sign to
the currency markets that Japan is serious about tackling its huge trade
surplus.
Although Mr Mieno expressed strong displeasure with the current speed of the
yen's rise, which was 'excessive' and would have an adverse effect on
Japan's economy, the best way to tackle the surplus was to get the economy
back on the road to growth by taking dramatic steps to open and deregulate
Japan's markets, he said.
Deregulation, which is an issue the coalition government is keen to address,
was important not just to help imports enter the country but to increase
investment in Japan, he said.

THE Cambodian government yesterday launched a military and political
offensive against the Khmer Rouge with attacks on three of the guerrilla
group's bases. In pre-dawn raids, soldiers from the newly unified Cambodian
armed forces pounded Khmer Rouge bases in north-western Cambodia with
mortars and heavy artillery.
'We won't allow the Khmer Rouge to occupy their own zone any longer,' said
government co-chairman Prince Norodom Ranariddh at an open meeting with the
other co-chairman, Mr Hun Sen.
'From now on, any group or party that is outside the government is outside
the law,' the prince said. 'And if they are outside the law then they are
the enemies of the government, and guerrillas.'
'There is no need to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge,' Mr Hun Sen said. 'The
Khmer Rouge must give its army to the government and open its autonomous
zone.'
The government has also been broadcasting radio appeals and dropping
leaflets on Khmer Rouge soldiers calling on them to desert their commanders
and join the national army. They are being offered a reward and an
equivalent rank to the one they have in the Khmer Rouge.
United Nations officials said it was not clear how successful the military
offensive had been. The national army has made inroads into the three Khmer
Rouge bases, which are logistical centres, but so far they are not in
control of any of them.

THE three sides in the Bosnian peace talks yesterday agreed on a plan to
demilitarise Sarajevo and put the besieged capital under UN administration.
The proposals - agreed 'in principle' on Monday and now fleshed out in more
detail - provide for the city to be run by a UN administrator app-ointed by
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general.
The administrator will be advised by a body comprising four Moslems, three
Serbs, two Croats and one minority representative, probably Jewish.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said it had been agreed 'to
postpone a solution on Sarajevo for two years and, in the interim, the
capital will be administered by the UN'.
But officials at the Geneva talks pointed out that the agreement was to form
part of a wider Bosnian accord, suggesting it was unlikely to be implemented
quickly. UN officials in New York said the proposals would need a fresh
Security Council resolution and there might be disagreement among member
nations.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic played down the significance of
the agreement. It did nothing to 'solve the agony of Sarajevo,' he told the
FT. 'We need the immediate lifting of the siege.'
Fierce fighting elsewhere in Bosnia yesterday threatened to undermine the
Geneva peace talks. A UN protection force official in Zagreb said fighting
was continuing between Moslem and Croat forces in central Bosnia, in spite
of formal agreements for a ceasefire.
UN officials in Sarajevo, meanwhile, reiterated warnings that the 35,000
Moslem inhabitants of Mostar to the south-west, who have been cut off from
humanitarian supplies by fierce fighting between Croat and Serb forces
around the city, were facing critical shortages of food and water.
A Red Cross worker in Mostar confirmed that the situation was deteriorating,
and said the city was under sporadic shelling.
The US yesterday said that Croatia could face economic sanctions if its
troops continued to impede relief supplies to Mostar.
But the State Department said there was no question of threatening military
action against the Croatians along the lines of the threat of air strikes
levelled at the Bosnian Serbs surrounding Sarajevo.
US officials remain reluctant to make any specific promise to contribute
troops to a Bosnia peacekeeping force, should a settlement be reached, but
reaffirmed their general commitment to take part.
Amid continued diplomatic tension between the UN and Nato over possible air
strikes, the Belgian government announced it fully supported
Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont, the Belgian UN commander in Sarajevo,
in spite of his controversial comments attacking Washington's threatened air
strikes.
Gen Briquemont and Brigadier Vere Hayes, his British chief of staff, were
quoted earlier this week criticising Nato plans for air strikes.
A UN spokesman said late yesterday the organisation now was in a position to
use air power in Bosnia. Ms Madeleine Albright, US envoy and Security
Council president, had been informed.
The UN announced on August 11 that all arrangements were in place for
possible air strikes, but that tests were being carried out. The
announcement indicates these have been completed.

AN anti-corruption commission made up of supporters of Russian president
Boris Yeltsin yesterday accused the vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi,
one of Mr Yeltsin's most outspoken critics, of being 'linked' to a Swiss
bank account containing millions of dollars smuggled from Russia.
The commission also asked parliament to sack another Yeltsin opponent, the
chief prosecutor, Mr Valentin Stepankov, Russia's most senior legal
official, and to 'review the conduct' of Mr Rutskoi. Mr Rutskoi dismissed
the charges and described his accusers as 'a committee of rascals'.
The commission, whose chairman is the minister of justice, was set up by Mr
Yeltsin. It has no authority to prosecute individuals, but it can make
recommendations to the president that he bring cases before either the
public prosecutors or parliament.
Yesterday's allegations highlight the extent to which widely popular
anti-corruption campaigns are being wielded as political weapons in the
conflict between Mr Yeltsin and his conservative antagonists. The battle
began last April when Mr Rutskoi accused top Yeltsin allies of assisting
'mafia-style groups' in their attempt to 'seize control of the country'. Mr
Stepankov continued the offensive by launching corruption probes into the
affairs of two cabinet ministers who are strong supporters of the president.
Mr Yeltsin's camp struck back yesterday. Mr Andrei Makarov, a member of the
anti-corruption commission, said the group had uncovered a network of
corruption in the Russian government and law-enforcement agencies. 'We are
no longer dealing with individuals but a fully fledged system,' Mr Makarov
said.
He also accused Mr Stepankov of plotting to murder him and said that he
could substantiate his charges with taped telephone conversations.
Yesterday's allegations included charges that officials illegally diverted
oil which had been earmarked to fulfil Russian state contracts with Bulgaria
and India and sold it instead in western Europe, privately pocketing the
revenues.
Mr Yuri Kalmikov, the Russian minister of justice and chairman of the
commission, blamed the prosecutor-general's office for 'complete failure in
the struggle against crime' and said he was handing his commission's charges
over to the Moscow prosecutor's office instead.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of parliament and one of Mr Yeltsin's
most bitter opponents, defended Mr Stepankov as the only Russian official
seriously battling corruption.
In response to widespread fears that many export deals benefit corrupt
officials, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations yesterday severely
restricted the number of companies, including joint ventures, allowed to
trade in strategic raw materials. Only four companies have retained the
right to export oil, five to export petroleum products and five to export
coloured metals.

THE recently constructed office suite of the president of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development would not disgrace a Greek shipping
magnate.
It has three ante-chambers, a private bathroom, mirrored ceilings, a deep
white rug and spectacular views of the City of London and St Paul's
Cathedral.
Mr Jacques Attali, for whom the top-floor office was designed, quit the bank
a month ago, just as it was finished.
His successor, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, has less flamboyant tastes. But
given the severe criticism the EBRD has faced for the extravagance of its
spending on its head office, Mr de Larosiere is unlikely to ask for an
immediate redecoration.
Mr Ron Freeman, who has been acting EBRD president since Mr Attali went,
yesterday cautioned Mr de Larosiere to adopt a policy of slow change in
respect of the bank's operations.
Mr Freeman, who remains as first vice-president in charge of merchant
banking, urged Mr de Larosiere not to implement Mr Attali's proposal to
merge the merchant banking department, which makes private sector
investments, with development banking, responsible for infrastructure
projects, many of which are in the public sector.
'The benefits of a restructuring have been way overdone,' he said. 'The
departments are already working much closer together.'
The bank was set up in the spring of 1991 to encourage the development of
market economies in eastern Europe. It later gained responsibility for the
countries of the former Soviet Union.
Some of the countries and agencies which own the bank have become concerned
that it is not making sufficient economic impact on the region. A merger of
those departments was intended to help the bank make investment decisions
based on the needs of the economies rather than purely on the potential
return to be earned.
However, Mr Freeman said that the departments had been working much more
closely together over the past few weeks and that the best way forward was
to create inter-departmental teams to work on individual projects.
On the other hand, he said that there would inevitably be a relaxation in
the stipulation, contained in the bank's charter, that no more than 40 per
cent of investments should be directed to the public sector.
But that does not mean that the bank's commitment to stimulating the private
sector would be reduced, he insisted. The countries of the former Soviet
Union, which only became eligible for EBRD investments after the bank's
statutes were written, are far less developed than many in eastern Europe
and therefore need more infrastructure and public sector investment.
However, the rate at which it has disbursed loan and equity finance, whether
for private or public sector projects, has been slow. In 1992, just Ecu126m
(Pounds 95.13m) was disbursed, compared with a budget 'base case' of
Ecu272m. In total, the bank has now disbursed Ecu274m and made commitments
to invest Ecu1.6bn.
Mr Freeman said that criticism of the slow rate of disbursement was
misplaced. He said he felt the bank should be disbursing more slowly.
Only by keeping back funds could the EBRD put pressure on governments to put
in place conditions necessary for a private sector to flourish.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Steering system problem in jet crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PRELIMINARY report on the crash of Sweden's fly-by-wire Gripen jet fighter
in central Stockholm earlier this month has blamed a combination of the
aircraft's steering system and the pilot's joystick movements.
The findings of the official inquiry will be crucial to the future of the
SKr60bn (Pounds 5bn) project because of the jet's importance for Sweden's
military aerospace programme.
The JAS 39 Gripen is a single-engine, multi-role fighter being developed by
a consortium led by Saab-Scania and including Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson
Radar Electronics and FFV Aerotech (part of the Celsius defence group which
is currently being privatised).
The project is already over budget and behind schedule, leading some
commentators to question whether Sweden can maintain a viable military
aerospace industry on its own. A prototype of the aircraft crashed during
the development phase in 1989.
Yesterday's report said the sensitivity of the steering system needed to be
corrected, but it otherwise found no technical faults. It did not blame the
pilot, Lars Radestrom, directly, despite saying his 'large and rapid
joystick movements' contributed to the accident.
The high-profile crash took place during an air display in front of
thousands of spectators on August 8. However, there were no casualties.
The Swedish air force has ordered 140 aircraft but consortium members have
been relying on export orders to make the project a commercial success.
They are looking to sell 500 aircraft in the next 10-20 years. Although they
have never identified potential export markets, countries in South-East
Asia, Latin America, and central and eastern Europe have all been mentioned.
There was bitter disappointment last year when the Finnish government opted
to buy 57 new F18s from the US group McDonnell Douglas.
Mr Anders Bjorck, Sweden's defence minister, said yesterday: 'There is
nothing in the report to indicate the JAS project should be interrupted. I
hope that the fault can be corrected as quickly as possible so the aircraft
will be able to fly again soon.'

FT  19 AUG 93 / GDP figure helps lift recession gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMANY'S gross domestic product for the second quarter of this year
was unchanged compared with the first three months, fuelling hopes that the
recession has finally bottomed out.
Latest statistics from the federal Economics Ministry showed that the
decline in GDP over the four previous quarters had been stemmed in the
second quarter. During the first three months of this year it fell by 1.5
per cent from the previous quarter, or 3.2 per cent over the same period
last year.
However, the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Forecasting (DIW)
yesterday dampened expectations for growth in the third quarter. It
predicted that the economy would stay flat largely because rising
unemployment was curtailing private consumption. It predicted that GDP for
1993 would decline by 2 per cent.
The two reports coincide with the release of official statistics on sales
for the manufacturing and mining industry for the first half of the year.
They show a fall of 8 per cent, to DM942.7bn (Pounds 377bn), compared to the
same period a year ago, while exports, which totalled DM246.9bn, declined by
9 per cent.
However, both the ministry and the DIW are cautiously optimistic about
growth in eastern Germany. DIW expects GDP to grow by 5 per cent this year
in the five eastern Lander. It rose 6.3 per cent in the second quarter,
compared to 3.9 per cent in the previous three months.
However, such growth is coming from a very low base. East German GDP
contracted by 31.4 per cent in 1991, when the economy collapsed following
monetary union, which exposed the region's lack of competitiveness, and the
subsequent loss of industry's markets in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. GDP growth in 1992 was 6.8 per cent.
Much of the growth in eastern Germany remains concentrated on the
construction industry and services.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Jacques II leads restoration at EBRD: The rise of a French
mandarin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FISCAL disciplinarian. A stickler for detail. A dedicated civil servant.
These are the kind of epithets used by former colleagues to describe Mr
Jacques de Larosiere, the new head of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. They suggest he will run a much tighter ship than his
predecessor, Mr Jacques Attali.
In Paris, government and financial officials say Mr de Larosiere, the
63-year old governor of the Bank of France, has the expertise and style to
set a new course for the EBRD and to repair the damage to France's image
wrought by Mr Attali's forced departure.
'The problems encountered by Mr Attali were a result of his style, but also
a result of his lack of experience in banking and finance,' said one French
government official. 'In both regards we expect a difference with Mr de
Larosiere.'
Statesmanlike and precise, Mr de Larosiere comes across as the archetypal
central banker. Mr Attali, by contrast, struck many bankers as a Bohemian
intellectual.
Mr de Larosiere certainly has more impressive financial credentials than Mr
Attali, who had never previously run a bank.
Before becoming governor of the Bank of France in 1987 he served for eight
years as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
Before that he worked his way up the ranks of the French Treasury, a period
during which he managed development assistance programmes at the French
Economics Ministry and chaired the economic development committee of the
OECD. In 1974 he was appointed head of the French Treasury.
According to one former monetary official in Washington, Mr de Larosiere is
a disciplined bureaucrat. 'He has always regarded himself as an instrument
of his political masters. He will not have his own agenda.'
It was during Mr de Larosiere's stint at the IMF in the early 1980s that the
third world debt crisis briefly threatened the stability of the global
financial system. Mr de Larosiere is remembered for being cool and
resourceful during the crisis. Mr Attali himself has contributed to this
impression, writing in 1985: 'The worst is over for Argentinian debt thanks
to de Larosiere who knew how to manage the crisis with the private banks.'
However, others query the relevance of much of Mr de Larosiere's experience
for his new task. One former senior IMF official notes that Mr de
Larosiere's expertise lies largely in macroeconomic and fiscal policy.
He has no track record in promoting entrepreneurship or private sector
development, a job that might come more naturally to a private-sector
banker.
'His IMF background does not reassure me,' says Professor Hans Singer of the
Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, a long-term critic
of IMF structural adjustment programmes. He would have preferred a 'neutral
figure', perhaps from one of the Nordic countries rather than somebody
associated with the IMF's 'contractionist, monetarist framework'.
'The west missed an opportunity in not appointing a well-qualified east
European,' comments Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington.
Mr de Larosiere's most important contribution is likely to be in restoring
morale and reforming the management of the EBRD which, under Mr Attali, has
been heavily criticised for its slow disbursement of loans to eastern Europe
and for its lack of financial controls.
'He is quiet, not bombastic, but he can be very tough,' says Mr Paul
Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, who worked
alongside Mr de Larosiere during the 1980s debt crisis.
Mr de Larosiere 'will run the EBRD with a firm hand', says a former
colleague at the IMF. 'He likes to make sure people know who is boss. He
loves the thought of putting order into finances.'
At the Bank of France, Mr de Larosiere leaves more harmonious labour
relations and a more efficient management structure than when he arrived.
In 1987 the unions at the bank launched sporadic protests against planned
changes to working practices. Mr de Larosiere reached an agreement with the
unions and subsequently reformed the management structure, encouraging
greater delegation of decision-making. Apart from the occasional spat, such
as during the recent legislation to make the central bank independent,
labour relations have been relatively smooth during his tenure.
Those who have worked with him say his management style is firm but open.
'He likes to build a consensus before acting,' says a colleague at the Bank
of France.
At both the IMF and the Bank of France, Mr de Larosiere won a reputation as
an ardent advocate of macroeconomic austerity. At the IMF he had an almost
emotional attachment to fiscal retrenchment in debtor countries, according
to insiders.
In France the same firmness has been evident in Mr de Larosiere's conduct of
monetary policy.
An unswerving advocate of the strong franc policy of successive governments,
he has sought to ensure a policy of financial discipline to reduce
inflationary pressures and to improve the competitiveness of French
industry.
This policy has been successful, with French unit labour costs now lower
than most of France's European competitors and with annual inflation at a
meagre 2 per cent.
However, the sustained assaults against the franc last month have
strengthened the hands of those in Paris who are pressing for a more
expansionary economic policy.
The currency crisis has also cast a shadow over Mr de Larosiere's vision for
western Europe.
He helped prepare the Delors report on European economic and monetary union,
which laid the foundation for the Maastricht treaty, but which has been
shaken by the weakening of the ERM.
Approaching retirement age, Mr de Larosiere must now adjust to new horizons.
He is likely to find the challenge of helping to revive the private sectors
of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at least as demanding as any
other he has faced in a long and distinguished career.

forecasts for end to recession

GERMAN economic recovery is likely to be slow and hesitant, with growth of
1.4 per cent in all-German gross domestic product next year, compared with a
decline of 1.9 per cent in the current year, according to the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development.
For the west German economy alone, the organisation expects a year-on-year
real GDP decline of 2.5 per cent this year, followed by an increase of just
1.0 per cent in 1994. That is clearly more pessimistic than the latest
forecast from the German Economics Ministry, which is looking for a 1.5 per
cent growth of GDP next year, after a decline of the same amount in 1993.
The caution of the OECD annual report, prepared in June and published today,
is based on the probability of continuing sluggish consumer demand, with
unemployment continuing to rise; an effective freeze on public sector
spending, with a 3 per cent nominal ceiling on growth; and relatively weak
export growth because of the hesitant world economic recovery and the strong
D-Mark.
The report was released in Bonn yesterday, after its conclusions had been
leaked in German newspapers.
It assumes a continued easing in interest rates, as the Bundesbank responds
to slower inflation, continuing wage moderation, and 'growing economic
slack'. Inflation is assumed to fall from almost 4.5 per cent in the first
half of the current year, to below 3 per cent by the end of 1994.
'In the face of such an improving inflation outlook,' the OECD says,
'short-term interest rates are assumed to come down in the course of 1993 to
around 5 per cent by end-year, and then fall by perhaps another percentage
point in 1994, to 4 per cent by end year.' The Bundesbank discount rate
currently stands at 6.75 per cent.
Long-term interest rates are projected to fall only marginally, to around
6.25 per cent.
The other key element in German recovery, export earnings, are projected to
grow by only 2.5 per cent in 1993, and by some 5 per cent in 1994, with
competitiveness deteriorating further in the current year, because of the
strong D-Mark. Relative manufacturing unit costs in a common currency are
seen as increasing by some 5 per cent this year, before levelling off to an
increase of less than 1 per cent in 1994. On the basis of a comparison with
previous recovery periods from recession, the OECD expects an upturn in
investment to begin in the first quarter of next year. But it warns that
such an upturn may be delayed, because the last investment boom was
exceptionally strong.
'Capacity is likely to keep growing faster than projected demand, even with
slow or no growth of investment,' it says. 'Thus potential growth is likely
to exceed actual growth for the foreseeable future, precluding a turnaround
in capacity utilisation.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKETS in the US, Britain and Germany climbed to fresh highs
yesterday on hopes that lower European interest rates will spur economic
recovery in Europe and help fuel growth in the US.
Share prices in several Far Eastern markets also posted strong gains.
The UK and German markets were boosted by heavy overseas buying and reports
that institutional investors were shifting funds out of Japanese equities.
In the US, investors appeared confident that European economic revival would
aid the struggling US economy.
Throughout the day, the markets appeared to feed on each others' strength.
Just as Tuesday's new high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average spurred
early rises in London, so big gains there and in other overseas markets
helped lift US stocks at the opening in New York, sending the Dow through
3,600 for the first time.
Heavy demand for recently depressed drug stocks, and further declines in
domestic bond yields, also contributed to the advance of US equities. By the
close, the Dow had reached 3,604.86, up 17.88.
In the UK, the FT-SE 100 Index ended at 3,073.6, up 48.6, the biggest daily
gain since late-January.
The advance was fuelled by foreign demand, in particular from the US, as
global investment strategists recommended the London market in anticipation
of falling interest rates, a firm currency and growing confidence in the
recovery of the economy and corporate earnings.
The rise in share prices was backed by near record trading in traded options
and stock index futures.
German and Spanish stocks also hit highs for the year. Frankfurt's DAX index
ended up 25.55 at 1,935.75.
Five stock markets in Pacific Rim countries climbed to high points for the
year.
New Zealand equities rose 3.4 per cent to a three-year peak and Australia
shrugged off the impact of the federal budget to close at its best level
since 1987.
Malaysia reached an all-time high, Hong Kong climbed to its third
consecutive peak and Singapore its fourth on overseas demand for blue chips.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Treasury officials to spend two years in private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is to make fast-stream officials spend two years in
private-sector companies as a condition for promotion to senior levels of
the Civil Service.
Its policy co-ordinating management board, chaired by Sir Terence Burns,
permanent secretary to the Treasury, decided that civil servants approaching
assistant secretary level should leave the Great George Street department in
Whitehall for two-year secondments to companies throughout the UK.
The development comes as Britain's monetary authorities, the Treasury and
the Bank of England, struggle to overcome criticism that they are out of
touch with industry.
It amounts to an acknowledgement that most Treasury officials have spent
their careers within Whitehall and lack experience of the commercial world
that depends on their policies.
Of the eight most senior Treasury officials, only Sir Nigel Wicks, Sir Alan
Hardcastle and Mr Alan Budd have worked in the private sector. The rest have
spent their careers either in government or academia.
The system of secondments will complement a recent decision that top
Treasury officials should spend one day a year visiting UK companies. It
should help to shrug off the department's remote image by underscoring its
commitment to developing stronger links with business.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the move. 'The CBI supports
the principle of increased contact between Treasury officials and the
private sector, believing it will promote greater interchange and
understanding of each other's methods and requirements,' it said.
The system of secondments will affect about 85 civil servants, the most
successful of whom reach assistant secretary level in their mid-thirties.
It should cost industry nothing, in that the officials' salaries will
continue to be paid by the government.
The Treasury yesterday described the innovation as a 'fairly big change.
Resources and logistics permitting, it should affect about half our staff.'
About half of Treasury officials come to the department with some sort of
outside experience already.

FT  19 AUG 93 / A-level pass rates up for fifth year in succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A-LEVEL results out today show an increase in pass rates for the fifth year
in succession, with 80 per cent of entrants securing passes.
But the results, announced by the GCE examining boards, will intensify the
strain on the higher education system, which has made conditional offers to
more students than it can now afford to take.
The figures show a 1.6 per cent increase in the number of passes at grades A
to C (usually required for university entrance) and a 1.2 per cent rise in
the overall pass rate.
However, the number of entries in science subjects, which the government has
attempted to encourage, fell sharply, although provisional figures indicated
that total entries had risen.
Business studies showed the biggest rise in entries, up 17.6 per cent after
increases of more than 20 per cent in the previous two years. Religious
studies showed a rise of 13.1 per cent. However, the number of entrants for
physics fell 9.6 per cent.
The Business and Technology Education Council, which offers a vocational
alternative to A-levels, said the number of students completing its two-year
course for the BTEC national diploma had risen by 25 per cent.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said the fall in the number taking
science A-levels was disappointing, but described GCE A levels as a
continuing success story which were a credit to students and their teachers.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said that the higher pass
rate would intensify the difficulties for admissions tutors and applicants.
University applications increased by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this
year, but there was no funding for any expansion in student numbers.
The universities' difficulties follow a cut by the government earlier this
year in the tuition fees payable for each student in arts and non-applied
subjects from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300.
Most universities have already made conditional offers. Universities cannot
refuse any applicant who satisfies the conditions of their A-level offer.

MODEST price increases coupled with rising retail sales suggest the UK is on

Retail sales were up 4.4 per cent in July compared with a year ago, the
biggest year-on-year increase for more than four years, although they fell
0.2 per cent compared with June.
The headline inflation rate fell by 0.2 per cent on the month, leaving the
annual rate only slightly higher than June's 30-year low of 1.2 per cent.
Retail prices rose 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Excluding mortgage
interest payments, they rose 2.9 per cent, up from 2.8 per cent in June,
inside the Treasury's 1-4 per cent target range.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that
the government was not yet prepared to cut interest rates from 6 per cent.
'I don't want to lead you to expect any changes whatsoever,' Mr Portillo
said on television yesterday.
His comments sent the pound sharply higher. In London it closed up 2 1/4
pfennigs on the day at DM2.545. Against the dollar it closed up just under
three cents at Dollars 1.5125, gaining further in New York to close at
Dollars 1.5175.
Expectations of steady UK economic growth were reinforced by the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research, a leading economic research body.
But it warned that inflation is also likely to pick up next year.
The institute forecast that growth would accelerate to an annual rate of 3
per cent by the final quarter of this year and average 2.9 per cent in 1994.
While the institute expects underlying retail price inflation to stay within
the government's target range this year, it forecast that both the
'headline' and underlying inflation rates would reach around 4.5 per cent by
the middle of next year.
The institute expects the government to raise indirect taxes by about Pounds
2.5bn and cut interest rates by 0.5 points in its November Budget. But it
said the rate cut might have to be reversed in 1994 as inflation moves above
the official target range.
The Central Statistical Office figures showed that in the latest three
months retail sales rose by 0.7 per cent compared with the previous quarter,
and by 3.6 per cent compared with the same three months a year ago. Thus the
small July drop did not break the upward trend in retail sales.
The figures suggest that sales by mixed businesses - mainly department
stores - are leading the rise. In the three months to July, sales volumes
rose a seasonally adjusted 1.9 per cent, compared with the previous
three-month period. Food retailers' sales rose 0.4 per cent.
Sales by non-food retailers were up 0.4 per cent in the latest quarter, with
the strongest performance coming from household goods. These rose 3 per cent
in the three months to July to stand 10 per cent up on a year ago.
Clothing and footwear sales fell by 1 per cent in the latest three months.

FT  19 AUG 93 / Russia begins mass immunisation programme: More than 4,000
cases of diphtheria reported this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday announced a mass immunisation programme of its 150m
population in an attempt to halt a diphtheria epidemic.
Children will be inoculated first, but adults will have to wait until next
year, officials in Moscow said. Immunisation of the whole population will
take two years.
More than 4,000 cases of diphtheria have been reported in Russia so far this
year, with about 100 deaths. Local authorities and medical experts blame
deteriorating living standards and inadequate health supplies.
Diphtheria generally attacks the throat and tonsils and can severely damage
the heart and kidneys.
Other diseases are also reported to be on the increase. The incidence of
tuberculosis in Russia is up 26 per cent this year, Dr Andrei Monisov,
deputy head of the Russian government agency which deals with epidemics,
said yesterday in Moscow. Typhoid fever, which hit the southern Russian city
of Volgodonsk earlier this month, has infected 106 people.
The central Russian region of Altai has been declared 'a zone of increased
danger' because of an outbreak of anthrax, which 71 people contracted from
diseased meat.
Moscow and St Petersburg have been hit hardest by diphtheria, but the
epidemic has struck other regions of the country. Earlier this week a
quarantine was introduced in the Siberian town of Abakan when seven soldiers
in a military unit were diagnosed with diphtheria and another 43 identified
as carriers.
In Ukraine, Ms Roberta Feldman, an American who headed the International
Finance Corporation's small-scale privatisation programme, fell ill earlier
this year.
A Ukrainian doctor treated her with five times the normal dose of
out-of-date penicillin - the only appropriate medicine on hand in Kiev - and
the symptoms abated.
About two weeks later Ms Feldman saw her doctor in the US. His diagnosis -
yet to be confirmed by laboratory analysis - was that she was suffering from
bubonic plague. Ms Feldman still has a scar on her forehead but has
otherwise recovered.
Ms Feldman's experience is isolated - only one other case of plague seems to
have been detected recently in the former Soviet Union - but is indicative
of the spate of rare diseases making a disturbing reappearance.
Dr Monisov said the severity of the diphtheria outbreak was because large
numbers of Russians have not been immunised. Many Russians have recently
begun to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated because of the fear
that unsterilised needles might be used to administer the vaccine.
'There is a portion of the population in Moscow which does not trust state
medicine,' he said. According to Dr Monisov, less than 15 per cent of the
adult population in Russia has been inoculated against the disease. He said
that the government is stepping up its drive to inoculate Russian children
with safe, disposable syringes, but that Russia would not be able to produce
enough vaccine to treat adults until next year.
Dr Monisov said that, with 812 cases of diphtheria this year in Moscow out
of a total population of more than 9m, the statistical chance of contracting
the disease is slim. However, he encouraged tourists to be vaccinated before
travelling to Russia.
Thomson Holidays, one of Britain's largest travel groups, has suspended
tours to Moscow and St Petersburg from the end of August. 'Thomson just
didn't feel comfortable about sending any more tours to Russia,' the company
said. It said Thomson clients had found it difficult to obtain inoculations
against diphtheria on short notice in Britain.
Russian health officials attributed the increased incidence of infectious
diseases to the worsening economic situation and to the greater mobility of
the population since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The judge removed the block on the 50 per cent stake owned by Mr Maurizio
Gucci, grandson of the group's founder, requested last month by Investcorp,
the Bahrain-based merchant bank which owns the remaining shares.
Investcorp had sought the freeze pending the resolution of an arbitration

FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Degussa tumbles 26% to DM121m at
nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEGUSSA, the metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday warned there would
be no recovery in group profits in the last quarter of the financial year as
it reported a fall in pre-tax earnings by 26 per cent to DM121m (Dollars
70.3m) in the nine months to the end of June.
The group blamed the decline on reforms in the German healthcare sector,
combined with the effects of the worldwide recession on its metals
businesses.
It said there was no way it would be able to catch up the shortfall in
profits in the rest of the financial year.
In contrast to the fall in earnings, group sales rose strongly, up by 13 per
cent to DM10.7bn. But Degussa said that the bulk of the increase was due to
sharply increased precious metals trading and sales together with changes in
the companies included in the consolidated figures.
Stripping out these factors, turnover would have been just below the level
of the comparable period last year, Degussa said.
Losses in the metals division - which accounts for just over one-third of
group turnover excluding precious metals - were 'markedly higher' than last
year, Degussa said, reflecting weak demand amid the recessionary
environment. There was a slight improvement in profits from the chemicals
division.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS is to invest DM500m (Dollars 290m) to build a new range of
diesel engines at its main Adam Opel engine plant at Kaiserslautern,
Germany, after winning agreement from trade unions on a package of
far-reaching labour reforms at the plant.
The US carmaker has chosen to build the range in Germany despite the burden
of German labour costs, the highest in the world auto industry.
Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said the
group had decided on Kaiserslautern, because of progress it had made in
introducing streamlined 'lean' production methods at the plant. It has won
agreement for team working and the integration of production and maintenance
work.
The diesel engine plant will operate for 24 hours a day for five days a week
and will continue running through rest periods. Shift changes will be
achieved without any break of production, and preventive maintenance will be
performed as part of normal working time on Saturdays without payment of any
overtime premium.
Opel is cutting the layers of management at the plant from five to four, and
the works council has agreed to work to lower absenteeism to 'an
internationally competitive level' of less than 5 per cent. Opel suffers
absenteeism of around 9 per cent at its Bochum and Russelsheim plants in
Germany.
The company said it believed that with the new labour agreement 'competitive
manufacturing will also continue to be possible in Germany'. The choice of
Kaiserslautern was a commitment by Opel to Germany, said Mr Herman.
The facility will have capacity to produce 250,000 engines a year with
production starting at the end of 1995. It will employ 475 people at full
capacity and will help to slow the fall in the Opel workforce at the site.
GM urgently needs a modern diesel power unit for its European car range. It
has fallen behind several of its main rivals, including Volkswagen and
Peugeot, in the provision of competitive diesel engines at a time when
diesels are rapidly growing in popularity. It was forced yesterday to cut
the prices of its 1.7 litre Vectra and Astra diesel cars in Germany by
DM1,000 per car to try to bolster sales.
Diesel engines accounted for 17.1 per cent of new car sales in Europe last
year compared with 14.7 per cent a year earlier, according to figures from
Automotive Industry Data. The diesel market share in Germany jumped to 15
from 12 per cent.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Slower S Korean growth seen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRIVATE economic institutes yesterday predicted that South Korea's economic
growth would slow to around 5 per cent this year as a result of the
introduction of the real-name financial system last week.
The real-name system, which bans the use of aliases in financial
transactions, is meant to reduce the size of the underground economy.
Four institutes, all associated with the country's large conglomerates, said
the new system will further dampen corporate investment by creating business
uncertainty.
It will also cause financial difficulties for small and medium businesses,
which are dependent on the unofficial kerb market for credit. The kerb
market is likely to be severely hurt by the new measure because it is
largely funded by money held in false-name accounts.
The government in January set a growth target of 6 per cent for 1993 against
last year's 4.7 per cent, the lowest growth rate in 12 years.
But the central bank last month estimated that GNP growth will reach 5.7 per
cent because of declining corporate investments, which contracted by 7.3 per
cent during the first half of 1993 due to sluggish demand both at home and
abroad, excess production capacity and higher interest rates.
The central bank also blamed production disruptions caused by strikes at
Hyundai, the nation's largest conglomerate, for slower growth.
Inflation is expected to accelerate to between 6 and 7 per cent from
previous predictions of 5 to 5.5 per cent, according to the institutes.
This reflects growing private spending as consumers liquidate their
false-name bank accounts and buy goods to avoid paying tax on their savings.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA has asked Israel to stop seeking an improvement in relations
with North Korea until suspicions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme are
resolved, writes John Burton.
The South Korean request followed a meeting between Israeli and North Korean
officials last week in Beijing.
Israel has held talks with North Korea to persuade it to stop supplying
Scud-C missiles to Syria and Iran. The tempo of contacts has increased
following North Korea's successful test firing in May of its Rodong-I
ballistic missile.
North Korea reportedly has agreed to sell the missile to Iran. The Rodong-I
could reach Israel from western Iran.
Pyongyang proposed last October that Israel purchase a North Korean gold
mine for Dollars 1bn, the amount of money it said it would lose if it
stopped selling missiles to Israel's enemies. Israel rejected that offer,
but the talks continue on other forms of economic co-operation.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Russia launches oil privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA launches the first official privatisation of oil companies today.
On offer are just 8.3 per cent of Komineft, which produces oil and gas, and
two of its subsidiaries, Tebukneft, which produces oil, and Snabneft, which
supplies oil equipment. The fact that only a small proportion of shares are
on sale, compared to stakes offered in manufacturing and services, reflects
the political battle around privatisation, particularly of such a key
industry.
Despite attempts by Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, to switch
companies from socialism to capitalism as fast as possible, there has been
well-argued opposition to giving away shares in an industry requiring
particularly large capital investment.
Subscription for shares, offered in exchange for privatisation vouchers
given to each Russian citizen but purchasable by foreigners and others, is
open until September 15.
Mr Valentin Leonidov, director-general of Komineft, said another 8 per cent
of his company would be put on sale later for money, with the proceeds
providing a welcome 'if insignificant' financial boost of perhaps Rbs3bn.
He hoped to attract some foreign investors.
Komineft is one of Russia's better-run oil companies. 'Leonidov is
excellent,' said one western oil executive whose company has a joint venture
with Komineft. 'With Komineft, you would be buying into something that's
functioning relatively well already.'
Although the oil industry is considered a jewel of the Russian economy, it
is saddled with customers who do not pay their bills, including state-owned
refineries. As a result, it is owed a total of Rbs1,200bn. Komineft is owed
Rbs66bn, while owing other companies just Rbs5bn.
Starved of investment by the state, a quarter of his oil wells are idle, and
he expects his production, including that produced by joint ventures, to
fall to 11m tonnes this year from 12m last year.
He has so far relied mainly on foreign capital to help redress the
situation, setting up five joint ventures with foreign partners which supply
equipment in return for the right to export oil produced.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Paris sets out plan for jobs increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has finalised a five-year plan to fight unemployment
by reducing the costs of hiring workers while maintaining social benefits,
the Labour Ministry said yesterday.
Government officials said that the scheme would be the centrepiece of its
strategy to reduce unemployment, forecast to rise to 12.5 per cent by the
end of the year. But they declined to give details before the plan is
formally announced on Thursday.
The plan is expected to include a fixed timetable for the government's
commitment gradually to take over from employers the burden of social
security charges for employees' families. The French government has already
cut employers' payments for the lowest paid workers and is committed to
doing away with them entirely.
The plan may also include modifications to the SMIC, the inflation-indexed
minimum wage. The SMIC is blamed by many employers and political
commentators as one of the principal factors in France's high unemployment
rate, particularly among the young. The unemployment rate for 18-25 year
olds is about 20 per cent, one of the highest rates in Europe.
But Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said last week in a television
interview that he did not want 'to use the pretext of an economic crisis to
reduce the protection of the least advantaged in the country'.
Officials at the Labour Ministry said that the main emphasis of the plan,
which contains about 50 measures, would be the simplification of procedures
and the reduction of costs relating to access to the labour market, training
and state administration.
Mr Balladur will discuss the plan with trade unions and employers on
September 6. It will go to the full cabinet on September 15 and be presented
to parliament from October 4.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Rexrodt moves to defuse VW spying row with GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GUNTER Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday stepped into the
bitter dispute between the motor giants Volkswagen and Adam Opel, General
Motors' German subsidiary, apparently aiming to defuse the conflict.
His intervention is a clear indication of concern at the highest levels of
the German government over the damage done to the country's international
reputation by the row over the alleged theft of industrial secrets.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as Mr Rexrodt himself, has already publicly
urged the two sides to settle their differences.
Mr Rexrodt invited Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, for talks at the
economics ministry in Bonn last night and he has agreed on a similar meeting
with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, to be held on Friday. Both
companies have agreed to the discussions.
A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt was not seeking to mediate directly
in the dispute, in which GM has accused VW of industrial espionage and the
theft of confidential docu-ments. 'He is merely seeking to inform himself
about the situation, and about the arguments on both sides,' she said.
The move was immediately welcomed by VW as a step towards peace talks
between the two companies. They have been at loggerheads since Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing director for GM,
defected to VW in March. GM accused Mr Lopez and several associates of
systematically plundering industrial secrets before their departure.
There was less enthusiasm from senior officials at Opel, who insist that
before the two companies can sit down together Mr Piech must withdraw what
Opel sees as anti-American accusations against GM, and his suggestion that
the US company was somehow responsible for planting its secret documents on
VW employees.
In a furious outburst last month, Mr Piech suggested GM was trying to damage
VW in a commercially motivated war. This week he underscored his commitment
to his production director, repeating that he would 'put my hand in the
fire' for Mr Lopez.
Opel officials added yesterday that the company would not enter peace talks
while the German legal authorities were in the middle of an investigation
into allegations of theft, industrial espionage and fraud.
At VW, Mr Otto Wachs, a company spokesman, said the Rexrodt initiative was
'very much to be welcomed, because it supports us in our efforts to talk to
each other. For two weeks we have been trying to initiate talks with Opel,
but so far without success,' he said.
Yesterday, Mr Georg Nauth, spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in
Darmstadt, which is responsible for the investigation, expressed some doubt
about VW's move to appoint independent assessors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand. He
insisted his office was already in possession of more information than would
be available to an independent investigator.
'An independent investigator cannot undertake searches, cannot confiscate
documents, and cannot make inquiries at Opel,' he said.

FT  18 AUG 93 / British Gas may be broken up by UK government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS, one of Europe's largest energy companies, would be forced to
sell its trading activities and see the eventual abolition of its monopoly
over household supply if the UK government adopts recommendations made
yesterday by the country's Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The report proposed a nine-year timetable for the introduction of
competition into the entire UK gas market.
The proposals were much more far-reaching than had been expected in the gas
industry. If accepted by the government, they would lead to the largest
corporate break-up ever seen in the UK, and bring about a complete
transformation of gas transportation and supply.
British Gas, which was privatised by the UK government in 1986, had turnover
approaching Pounds 10.3bn (Dollars 15bn) in 1992, of which Pounds 8.1bn
arose from UK gas supply.
The introduction of full competition into household gas supply would go
further than any other country, including the US, in freeing up the market
for domestic customers.
British Gas said the proposals would result in the loss of at least 20,000
jobs at the company and keep its profits below the levels achieved in recent
years. But the company's shares rose 4p to 328p on the London Stock
Exchange. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said the report's
recommendations should allow the company to plan ahead with greater
certainty. However, he said it would place British Gas under financial
strain, forcing a stringent review of its entire investment programme.
The monopoly authority sug-gested a phased introduction of more competition
into the gas market with a partial opening up on March 31 1997. The
company's trading arm would have to be sold off by then to remove any
conflicts of interest between its marketing activities and its operation of
the pipelines network.
A complex pricing formula which governs the charges British Gas can levy on
households should also be eased slightly, the commission suggested.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will have to decide
whether to enshrine the commission's recommendations into law. The
government could shy away from changes which could lead to higher prices for
domestic customers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, consumer affairs minister, said the government had not
reached a view on the commission's findings. The government may want to push
ahead with the introduction of competition more quickly. Ofgas, the industry
regulator, said it believed the commission had been 'overly cautious' in its
proposals for freeing up the market.
Ofgas and many of British Gas's rivals which supply industrial customers
would like to see the gas market freed up at the same time as electricity
supply, scheduled for 1998.
The monopolies inquiry was called a year ago after a series of rows between
British Gas and its regulator. Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, wanted the
Commission to set a rate of return that British Gas should be allowed to
earn from its pipeline operations. Mr Brown, however, requested a full
review of the company's activities.
British Gas was last subject to a Monopolies Commission investigation in
1988 because competition in the industrial supply market had been slow to
develop since privatisation. The inquiry concluded that this resulted from
lack of access to gas supplies and recommended that British Gas buy no more
than 90 per cent of gas from new North Sea fields.
British Gas yesterday said the government should consider setting up a body
to regulate Britain's regulators after the Monopolies Commission rejected a
request by it and other companies for an examination of the overall system
of regulation.

FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tour war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a price war among tour operators knocked Airtours and Owners
Abroad, although both recovered strongly to limit the losses. Airtours
finished 3 down at 375p and Owners just a half-penny off at 78p.
Although similar talk accompanies the launch of the 1994 brochures every
year, this year's has been given added spice by the consolidation in the
travel industry this year with Airtours buying two major travel agencies and
Thomas Cook taking a big stake in Owners Abroad.
Leisure analysts said the new integrated companies were unlikely to want to
sustain a situation where discounts being offered by travel agencies are
added to price cuts from the tour operating business. 'These things are
usually shown up to be phoney wars pretty quickly,' said a seasoned
observer.
Market perceptions that the MMC report into British Gas was a lot less
damaging to the share price than might have been expected triggered a burst
of strong buying interest in water shares, viewed as a prime target for
regulatory interference.
The big trading stocks in the sector all attracted strong support, and were
led forward by Thames, 8 better at 533p, North West, 7 1/2 firmer at 528 1/2
p, Seven Trent, 6 up at 532p, and Anglian, 5 higher at 523p. Wessex
spearheaded the more thinly traded issues, advancing 10 to 633p, while South
West added 9 at 558p.
The electricity stocks also made good progress, with Norweb prominent and
finally 7 higher at 564p.
Analysts said the market was wrong to assume that other regulatory bodies
would adopt a similar course to that undertaken in the gas industry. 'An
assumption that there is a super-regulator and a utilities-wide policy is a
dangerous course to steer and is quite clearly not the case,' said one
utilities specialist, who advised caution in chasing the recently buoyant
utilities sectors any higher.
There was renewed speculation that Grand Metropolitan is about to sell its
Chef and Brewer chain of public houses and restaurants. A sale of Chef and
Brewer has been rumoured for several months, although drinks analysts
believe that negotiations with several parties have foundered over price.
GrandMet was thought to be seeking around Pounds 750m for the 1,600-strong
chain.
Whitbread was one name being suggested yesterday. Its 'A' shares moved
forward 9 to 508p. GrandMet eased 2 to 451p.
Fears that BICC would announce a rights issue with today's interim results
appear to have faded. The shares improved 20 to 417p.
Presentations by Kwik Save were said to have encouraged some buying interest
and the shares ended 22 higher at 710p.
Dealers said renewed whispers in the market of a takeover bid for United
Biscuits had no foundation. The shares climbed 4 to 389p.

FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sedgwick pressured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 143m rights issue from Sedgwick, the insurance broking group, to
fund its acquisition of financial services group Noble Lowndes from TSB and
Scandinavian insurance broker Arvid Bergvall, came as a surprise to the
market. One insurance broking specialist described the move as 'realistic
recognition by Sedgwick of the need to push more deeply into the consulting
market'.
Sedgwick shares came under growing pressure as the session wore on, with
dealers becoming increasingly nervous about the possibility of US group
Transamerica placing a short 20m nil-paid shares in the market this morning.
The US group, which has a 24.1 per cent stake in Sedgwick, said it will not
take up its full entitlement to the issue.
By the close Sedgwick were 15 lower at 191p, with turnover reaching a hefty
5.1m shares, the biggest single day's business since mid-July.

FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited report on British Gas prepared by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission was given a cautious thumbs up by a stock market which
has been preparing itself for the possibility of much worse news.
Prior to news of the MMC report Gas shares were trading around 3 easier at
320 1/2 p. The market's initial reaction to the report was to hoist the
shares to a day's high point of 338p before a sustained bout of
profit-taking drove the share price down to a closing level of 327 1/2 p, a
net gain of 4.
The MMC report generated an upsurge in turnover in Gas shares, where some
38m changed hands during a frantic trading session. Turnover yesterday was
the highest for a single trading session since July 1990 when the UK
government sold its remaining 54m shares in Gas at 220 3/4 p a share.
Dealers said the main elements in the MMC report, including a recommendation
that the company divests its gas trading activities by March 1997 and a
downwards shift in its gas pricing formula, were no more than the market had
expected; 'It could have been much worse,' said one marketmaker.
Gas shares embarked on a strong upwards move at the beginning of last week
as the market picked up the scent of a less than onerous report from the
MMC. Many of the leading broking firms adopted a strong buy stance in the
stock, driving Gas shares up to what was then an all-time high.
One analyst who attended the post-MMC report meeting with Gas described the
atmosphere among the assembled host as 'slightly gloomy', and said the
feeling was that the result was 'not so bullish as a share price of 338p
suggests'.
Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull adopted a bearish view of the report.
'Sir James McKinnon will be feeling a lot happier than Cedric Brown after
this,' he said, adding that Gas 'will find it difficult to grow the
dividend'. Mr Alan Marshall, oil and gas specialist at Swiss Bank
Corporation, was firmly in the optimists' camp, setting a 350p price target
on the shares and describing the outcome of the report as 'pretty good'.
In another twist to the Gas story, rumours began circulating that Gas may
embark on a strong push into the global oil exploration business by
launching a bid for Lasmo, the troubled oil exploration and production
company.
It would not be the first time that Gas has shown interest in Lasmo. In the
late 1980s Gas launched an unsuccessful 'dawn raid' on Lasmo, netting only a
handful of shares in the group. There was considerable two-way interest in
Lasmo shares yesterday, turnover expanding to a much higher than usual 6.9m.
The stock gained a penny at 134p.

FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo back in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG shares moved smartly forward on a combination of technical factors and
news from the US. Glaxo was the best performer, gaining 36 1/2 at 558p in
hefty volume of 11m, the biggest daily turnover for six months. Initial
strength came from the announcement that the US authorities had approved
Zofran, the drug produced and marketed by Glaxo for the prevention of
post-operative nausea and vomiting. Drugs analysts said this wider use of
the product - Zofran has been available for narrower usage since February
1991 - was welcome, but warned that cheaper post-operative drugs were
available in the US.
Technical issues were also at work. Dealers in New York said a strong rise
in drugs stocks in the past two days on Wall Street was only just being
reflected in London. Yesterday's rises on Wall Street were inspired by a
speech by President Clinton on healthcare in which he made no reference to
cutting drug prices - an issue which has dogged the sector for several
months.
In addition, Glaxo shares are considered to have lagged behind their rivals
and there was some thought that they were looking cheap. Buying interest
from the US prompted The Bank of New York to annnounce yesterday that BNY
(Nominees), which holds stock on behalf of US investors, now holds 21.94 per
cent in Glaxo.
Among other drug stocks, SmithKline Beecham rose 16 to 448p and Wellcome 34
to 678p.

FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index closed at a record
high after a late afternoon squeeze in the futures drove the market sharply
forward, writes Joel Kibazo.
A good performance in the gilts sector late in the session brought strong
demand for the contract. Sentiment was boosted by a buoyant performance by
drug stocks around the same time, all of which pushed the contract to a high
of 3,038 just before 4pm.
Light profit-taking in the last few minutes before the close left September
at 3,031, just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 7 points,
on volume of 7,516.
The early part of the session was marked by mixed trading. The contract
opened at 3,019 and had fallen to 3,006 by 10am on sporadic selling. The
publication of a better than expected MMC investigation into British Gas
helped to halt the earlier decline.
It was followed by sideways trading for the next few hours before the late
demand not only sent September ahead but pulled the underlying cash market
higher.
Traded options were also busy and saw total volume of 33,816 lots, against
Monday's total of 23,573 contracts. Some 10,781 were dealt in the FT-SE 100
option. The stock options were particularly active and Vodafone Group led
the league table with a total of 3,881 contracts, followed by Lasmo with
2,949 trades.

FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds lead share prices higher again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INITIALLY sluggish UK stock market slipped back to test the Footsie 3,000
level early yesterday but then renewed its advance to close 16.7 up at a new
trading and closing peak of 3,025. Renewed gains in UK government bonds
provided the chief impetus for equities, with a squeeze on positions in both
stock index futures and blue chip shares driving prices ahead.
Corporate developments also worked in the stock market's favour. US
regulatory approval for Zofran, its post-operative nausea drug, brought a
welcome return of New York buying of Glaxo, which soon rubbed off on to the
other pharmaceutical leaders. Weakness of this key sector, which is
represented in the core stocks of most large investment funds, has been a
significant drag on market confidence this year.
The session opened well, with equity strategists at several leading
securities houses reaffirming their bullish stance on shares. Few analysts
have raised their 1993 forecasts in spite of the upsurge of the past month,
and the range of estimates for the Footsie remains 3,150 to 3,500.
However, with no lead at first from stock index futures or from gilts, share
prices began to wilt. Sedgwick, the insurance broker, called the market for
a Pounds 143m rights issue. The FT-SE 100 Index was soon 6.5 off at 3,001.8
although volume was low.
The first turn for the better came when the UK Monopolies and Mergers
Commission announced what was regarded as a somewhat more helpful report on
British Gas than had been feared by some stock market specialists. At first,
however, it was only British Gas shares, rather than the broad range of the
market, that responded positively to the news. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T's bid for
McCaw had disappointed speculators in Vodafone, although the shares remained
firm.
Equities were moving into the second half of the session before gains at the
long end of the bond market reactivated optimism for shares. Falling yields
on government bonds have been significant in prompting a reassessment of
prospects for the relative return on equities by the end of the year.
The running was taken up by stock index futures and it was soon evident that
last week's squeeze on share prices, reflecting unwillingness of fund
managers to sell while at the same time seeking to buy, had intensified.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 6.5 up at 3,465.9, also rose to a new peak but the
influence of the stock index futures, which is tied to the FT-SE 100 stocks,
and of the renewed confidence in pharmaceutical shares, also luminaries of
the FT-SE 100 Index, took the interest away from the second line issues.
Strong rises in British Gas, Glaxo and Wellcome gave a boost to the Footsie,
but the gain of 2.24 in the Dow Industrial Average as New York opened its
new session was of little importance for London.
Of the 638.4m shares traded through the Seaq network yesterday, the
contribution from non-Footsie stocks fell to only around 48 per cent,
against some 60 per cent last week.
More significantly, retail, or customer, business dipped to Pounds 1.12bn on
Monday, compared with recent daily averages of around Pounds 1.5bn -
implying that profit-taking had been fairly light.

FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late demand leaves Dow at
fresh peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices edged higher in busy trading yesterday, with most indices
setting new records, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 at 3,586.98, just
eclipsing the previous all-time peak of 3,583.35 set last week. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.75 higher at 453.13, while the
American SE composite gained 1.33 at 442.66 and the Nasdaq composite added
4.12 at 731.01, both new records. Trading volume on the New York SE came to
261m shares.
Equity markets opened lower yesterday, a natural reaction to Monday's heavy
buying which lifted several key indices to record highs.
Although the initial profit-taking depressed prices in the first few minutes
of trading, the selling was insufficiently widespread to leave stocks in the
red for particularly long.
Within an hour of the start the markets were back in positive territory, but
they struggled to make much headway for most of the day. The lack of a
strong lead from the bond market, where yields rose slightly, and some
disappointing economic news (the Commerce Department reported that housing
starts fell by 2.7 per cent in July), was to blame for the sluggish nature
of trading. A burst of late buying, however, allowed stocks to edge into
record territory just before the close.
The big news of the day was Hewlett-Packard, which dropped Dollars 5 to
Dollars 70 1/4 in heavy trading after reporting fiscal third-quarter
earnings of Dollars 1.06 a share, up from 75 cents a share a year ago, but
well short of Wall Street expectations - analysts' forecasts had averaged
around Dollars 1.20 a share for Hewlett-Packard's latest quarter. The stock
staged a strong recovery later, however, and ended just Dollars 1 3/8 down
on balance at Dollars 74.
Some other technology stocks ended notably firmer. Compaq was ahead Dollars
2 at Dollars 54 1/4 and IBM Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 43.
Retail issues were mixed in the wake of the release of second-quarter
earnings. Dayton Hudson fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/4 on news of a 43
per cent drop in profits to 28 cents a share. The company also said it would
take a 5 cents a share charge in the third quarter to cover changes in tax
rates.
JC Penney rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 3/4 after the company unveiled a
40 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings to Dollars 112m, or Dollars 42
cents a share.
Glaxo ADRs climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16 5/8 in volume of 2.6m after
the company received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to
market in the US its post-operative anti-nausea product Zofran.
Canada
TORONTO closed modestly higher, led by a strong gas sector and showing
little effect from yesterday's rise in the bank rate. The Bank of Canada key
rate rose 47 basis points to 4.67 per cent at the weekly Treasury-bill
tender.
The TSE 300 index was up 12.3 at 4,032.5 as advances narrowly outscored
declines by 365 to 359. Volume was a relatively moderate 50.9m shares valued
at CDollars 616.5m.
Energy stocks posted a 1.44 per cent index rise, while the industrial
products group was up 1.05 per cent, but golds lost some ground.

FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Wide variations in senior
bourse performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses saw wide variations in performance, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, closed for a holiday on Monday, lost ground on disappointment that
while the Bank of France eased its 24 hour lending rate, it left the
intervention rate unchanged.
The CAC-40 index shed 11.71 to 2,136.29 as turnover drifted back from
FFr3.6bn to FFr2.9bn. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that equities
were discounting a sharp fall in interest rates and 'a speedy resumption of
economic growth'. A period of consolidation could be expected, he said,
warning that 'disappointing company earnings figures should emphasise. . .
the seriousness of the current economic downturn'.
Euro Disney reacted to last week's news of a fall in third quarter revenues,
the shares slipping FFr4.45 or 6.8 per cent to FFr60.80. Peugeot lost FFr4
to FFr693, having announced that it was to suspend production of its 405
model in the UK.
FRANKFURT's DAX index eased 2.02 to 1910.17 after an intraday low of
1895.77. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.2bn.
Siemens consolidated, rising 30 pfg to DM684.90; it emerged that Monday's
DM8.60 gain followed an upgrade from 'long term buy' to 'buy' from DB
Research whose analyst, Mr Sonke Papenhausen, said that improving chip
demand had led to a 15 per cent increase in selling prices since last
October.
Its subsidiary, AEG, rose DM5.20 to DM173.50 on its leading role in a
Siemens-led consortium which has won a DM2.2bn high-speed train contract
from Germany's railroad authorities.
In retailing, Asko dropped DM55 to DM745 on its bid for Massa, which
reflected the terms and rose DM12 to DM184. In chemicals and metals, Degussa
fell DM11.50 to DM371.50 on a drop in half year profits; and, reflecting
hopes in mobile telecommunications, Mannesmann rose DM5.50 to DM335.50 on
the AT&amp;T bid for McCaw Cellular Communications in the US.
MADRID accelerated late on US buying, the general index closing 5.64 higher
at 286.86 for a gain of 5.9 per cent over the past five sessions. Turnover
climbed again, from Pta25.6bn to Pta26.7bn.
The buying made its impact more obviously, but not exclusively on the
relatively illiquid construction sector, where Cubiertas rose Pta540 to
Pta8,390, FCC by Pta990 to Pta14,390 and Valderivvas by Pta430 to Pta9,400.
In utilities, Gas Natural ended Pta520 higher at Pta9,200 and, among
US-traded blue chips, Telefonica rose Pta65 to Pta1,505.
ZURICH tried again to ignore bearish noises from London, the SMI index
hitting a high of 2,291 early in the day, but it subsided later to close
14.1 lower at 2,464.8.
There was some nervousness in advance of today's first half results from
Credit Suisse; its parent, CS Holding, fell SFr40 to SFr2,825. Cyclicals saw
profit-taking but closed above earlier lows, Alusuisse bearers ending SFr14
down at SFr558 after SFr548.
AMSTERDAM saw some switching out of cyclicals into defensive stocks as the
CBS Tendency index lost 1.2 to 126.7.
Among the gainers on the day, Unilever added Fl 2.30 to Fl 195.70 and
Elsevier Fl 3.60 to Fl 137.40. Williams de Broe in London upgraded the stock
yesterday, and commented that the group's long-term profitability would be
helped by cost cutting, product development and geographic expansion in
Asia, Latin America and east Europe.
Hunter Douglas fell Fl 3.70 or 6 per cent to FL 59.20; it reported a 16 per
cent gain in first half profits after the close.
STOCKHOLM was given a boost by SE Banken first half results which came in at
the top end of expectations. The bank also announced a SKr5bn rights issue
and said that it had withdrawn an application for state assistance. The A
shares advanced SKr9.50 to SKr78.50. The Affarsvarlden general index put on
16.9 to 1,301.9.in turnover of SKr1.5bn.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel said that the results had given the market
a shot in the arm. He added that the bank was now solidly capitalised even
although it might not be profitable for some time to come.
Attention would now turn, he said, to forthcoming results due out from
Electrolux today, Ericsson on Thursday, Investor on Friday and
Handelsbanken, Stora and Sandvik in the next week. Surprises were unlikely,
he said, but any less than positive comments could see some profit-taking.
MILAN was lifted by a broker's positive rerating of Generali, which gained
L1,505 or 4.7 per cent to L41,000, the Comit index putting on 15.21 or 2.5
per cent to 608.25.
However, Mr Marco Ortelli of brokers Akros Sim in Milan said that while the
Comit index has risen by some 20 per cent since mid-June, there were no
fundamental reasons behind the upswing.
Fiat and Olivetti were cases in point, he noted, the former adding another
L285 to L7,415 yesterday, in spite of recent figures showing a 30 per cent
decline in domestic car sales. Olivetti was up L43 at L2,168.
The cement and construction sector was another good performer on the day,
with Italcementi gaining L660 or 5.6 per cent to L12,475.

FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Singapore
establish new record highs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEIGHTENED hopes of a discount rate cut initially pushed up share prices,
but a late afternoon fall in the yen prompted profit-taking, and the Nikkei
average ended marginally lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei lost a net 59.51 at 20,841.98, having risen to a high for the day
of 21,025.60 during the morning, the first move above the 21,000 level since
June 7. However, the subsequent profit-taking pulled the index down to a low
for the session of 20,749.47 just before the close.
Volume increased to 320m shares from 234m. Dealers led market activity,
while foreign investors were active buyers. Overall rises still led declines
by 648 to 309 at the close, with 199 issues unchanged, but the Topix index
of all first section stocks was finally 6.29 easier at 1,681.75. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.42 firmer at 1,281.34.
The dollar, which fell to a record low of Y100.40 in the morning, managed to
close higher following comments by government officials which suggested that
an economic stimulus package was being formulated for the autumn. Traders
said buy orders were cancelled soon after the yen moved back to the Y101
level.
In spite of the Nikkei's retreat, some analysts said the underlying tone
remained firm. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson International said:
'People do not seem to be reacting to bad news because they do not want to
sell into a bottoming economy.'
Profit-taking depressed steelmakers and shipbuilders, Nippon Steel shedding
Y2 to Y390, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y11 to Y700 and Hitachi Zosen Y4 to
Y606.
Trading houses, which had firmed recently on hopes of an interest rate cut,
lost ground. Itochu, the most active issue of the day, receded Y7 to Y625
and Mitsubishi Y10 to Y1,160.
Oil issues gained further ground: Koa Oil was Y20 stronger at Y1,050.
Brokerages, which had eased on Monday on reports of heavy losses at Cosmo
Securities, turned upwards on bargain hunting. Nomura Securities put on Y10
at Y2,210 and Nikko Securities Y10 at Y1,350. Cosmo was once again suspended
for the day on the three major exchanges.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 53.71 to 22,718.49 in volume of 25.4m
shares. Electrical, machinery and textile issues weakened, while domestic
demand related stocks firmed.
Roundup
THERE were further record highs established by the Hong Kong and Singapore
markets yesterday.
HONG KONG made fresh headway, helped by strong overseas buying, and the Hang
Seng index ended 39.30 higher at another all-time closing peak of 7,528.79.
Earlier in the session it reached 7,541.77 before succumbing to
profit-taking. Turnover swelled to HKDollars 5.3bn from the previous day's
HKDollars 4.6bn.
Property shares were the day's only losers as banks led the market forward.
HSBC Holdings, which releases its interim results later in the month, was
the most active stock in turnover of HKDollars 341m as the shares climbed
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 85.50.
Profit-taking was evident in the property sector, with Hang Lung Development
relinquishing 10 cents to HKDollars 11.70 and Henderson Land losing 20 cents
to HKDollars 21.50.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index attained a new record close of
1,928.34 with a rise of 5.45.
Volume decreased to 111.8m shares from the 115.4m registered on Monday.
Among the actives were Great Eastern Life, Java Fund and Jurong Engineering.
In KUALA LUMPUR the index neared its previous record close set earlier this
month, the composite index advancing 12.15 to 784.91.
Tenaga and Telekom, which have a combined weighting of 40 per cent in the
index, firmed 30 cents apiece to MDollars 10.70 and MDollars 15.60
respectively.
SEOUL was in uncertain mood as sentiment remained upset by the government's
ban on false-name trading. The composite index finished 2.73 down at 688.94,
but off the day's low of 679.76. Turnover amounted to Won356.4bn.
Among the actives were companies with low price/earnings ratios, popular
with foreign institutions, following rumours that the government might lift
the ceiling on foreign ownership from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.
AUSTRALIA was lifted by strength in National Australia Bank, a firmer gold
sector and optimism ahead of the federal budget.
The All Ordinaries index closed 14.4 ahead at 1,885.1 in turnover of
ADollars 448.6m.
NAB appreciated 28 cents to ADollars 11.24 following a number of brokers'
upgrades.
The golds index moved up 68.0 to 2,148.9 on the overnight bullion price rise
in New York. North Flinders Mines moved forward 30 cents to ADollars 12.80
and Plutonic 25 cents to ADollars 7.15.
BOMBAY rallied after a weak start, with most leading shares ending firmer.
The BSE index climbed 73.65 to 2,576.98.
COLOMBO was pulled lower by a fall in blue chips, the all-share index
shedding 13.67 to 748.85. Turnover expanded to SLRs85m from SLRs57.2m.

FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany leads European turnover gains -
A look at the continued upsurge in bourse activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reflecting a 6.4 per cent advance by the FT-Actuaries Europe index in July,
turnover in Europe's top eight equity markets rose strongly for the second
month in succession.
A rise of 20.8 per cent for the month follows one of 20.3 per cent in June,
and a fall of 2.5 per cent in May against April, when markets seemed shaken
by their sheer ebullience in the early months of this year.
Turnover on Seaq International, the London-based screen dealing system, rose
by 21.8 per cent for the seven Contental markets, notes Mr James Cornish, a
strategist with NatWest Securities, which produces the turnover figures.
This, he says, means that London activity rose slightly as a percentage of
the domestic markets, underlining the strong interest of international
investors. Germany was the headline performer in volume terms over the
month, a 43.2 per cent rise in turnover comparing with a share price gain
for the market which was slightly below average, at 5.8 per cent in local
currency terms.
France, which showed a 5.6 per cent gain, saw slightly lower turnover on the
month, the clear inference for Germany being that share price appreciation
was less important to buyers, short-term, than other considerations.
The German equities team at Kleinwort Benson Research says as much.
'Liquidity has pushed the market ever higher,' it says, but the DAX index
has yet to revisit its all-time high and this sets Germany apart from many
other major European markets.'
In Frankfurt, the month started with key interest rate cuts from the
Bundesbank, but turnover did not start to motor until almost a week later as
it became widely perceived that US and UK investors, underweight in German
stocks, had changed their asset allocation policies. In the end, the month
came out 61 per cent higher than the previous three-month average, and only
2.8 per cent below the record level of January, 1990 in the euphoria
following the opening of the Berlin wall.
There were strong performances elsewhere. The Netherlands saw a gain of 27.8
per cent, 31 per cent over the previous three months, as the market rushed
to buy cyclical stocks; trading in Dutch stocks in London continued to rise
as a share of domestic volume, notes Mr Cornish.
In Belgium, with the market up 3.6 per cent, turnover rose 23.6 per cent to
a level not seen since March. Italian turnover climbed 15.6 per cent to a
record high, 31.2 per cent on its three-month average as the share price
index reocred after a fall in June. UK activity rose on interest rate hopes,
and its Swiss counterpart on this year's phenomenal interest in bank shares.
Spain joined France on the downtrend as economic uncertainty put stock
markets in the shade.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Money Markets: France trims overnight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH money market interest rates rose yesterday, in spite of the Bank of
France's decision to trim the cost of lending funds through its overnight
window, writes James Blitz.
The French authorities cut their overnight money market interest rate by
1/2 percentage point from 9.25 per cent to 8.75 per cent.
This was the third reduction in the cost of funds lent through this window
since the widening of the currency bands in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
However, dealers continued to think that the speed with which French rates
are coming down is too slow to improve the country's economic performance,
and those doubts were expressed in a weakening in the value of the French
franc on Monday.
The French domestic money markets were shut on Monday, but the cost of
three-month money rose sharply yesterday, reflecting the franc's poorer
performance the previous day. Three-month domestic cash rose from Friday's
8.30 per cent to 8.45 per cent yesterday. Offshore lending rates in the
euromarket softened, having risen sharply on Monday. They closed at 8.38 per
cent, having been at 8.55 per cent earlier this week.
French franc futures also reflected the upturn in cash rates, with the
September Pibor contract dropping 21 basis points to close at 92.82.
The Bundesbank, as expected, left its repo rate unchanged at 6.80 per cent
for 14-day funds in the run-up to today's money market tender.
German call money edged slightly higher yesterday, being quoted between 6.70
per cent and 6.80 per cent compared to 6.65 per cent to 6.75 per cent on
Monday. This was partly due to more tax payments being received.
Call money is still at the soft end of the Bundesbank's desired range. There
are few expectations of a reduc-tion in the Bundesbank's dis-count rate when
the central bank's council meets again on August 26.
Sterling markets remained quiet. Three-month money was unchanged at 5 7/8
per cent, although the yield curve sloped sharply downwards to 5 5/8 per
cent for six-month rates and 5 9/16 per cent for one-year cash. The December
short sterling contract was 2 basis points firmer at 94.73. A shortage of
Pounds 450m was removed in the afternoon with late assistance of Pounds 55m.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/yen decline checked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese yen fell sharply against the dollar yesterday, reversing its
recent upward trend, as dealers waited to see whether the Bank of Japan
would cut its official discount rate tomorrow, writes James Blitz.
On Monday, the Japanese currency looked as though it would break straight
through the Y100 barrier against the dollar, as dealers continued to be
swayed by the size of Japan's trade surplus and the belief that the US is
pursuing a dollar depreciation policy in an attempt to boost its exports.
However, the yen's rise was checked yesterday and, after closing in London
at Y101.05 on Monday, the currency depreciated to a low of Y102.30 in
European trading yesterday before ending at Y101.45. In New York it closed
at Y101.05.
There are strong expectations in the market that the Japanese authorities
could cut their official discount rate tomorrow by  1/2 percentage point to
2 per cent, in an attempt to boost their economy and stop a currency
appreciation that is damaging exports. Japanese government officials also
said that they had 'emer-gency measures' in mind to stop the yen's rise,
which led some dealers to take profits.
However, barring more currency intervention, it was hard to see what the
Japanese authorities could do. A cut in the ODR has already been discounted
by many dealers. Another fiscal boost would help the economy but would
possibly strengthen the currency. Mr John Hall, an economist at Swiss
Banking Corporation, believes the yen will break through to the Y90 level by
the end of the year in any event.
Trading in European currencies was dominated by a bout of D-Mark weakness,
with several dealers talking of speculators taking profits in the wake of
its recent move upwards.
The French franc appreciated sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, moving to
a close of FFr3.517 from a previous FFr3.544. In part, it was helped by
another reduction in the Bank of France's overnight rate of lending, this
time to 8.75 per cent from 9.25 per cent.
But comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance minister, that
France was not seeking to introduce capital controls in the wake of the
widening of exchange rate mechanism bands may also have helped. One leading
fund manager said the threat of capital controls might still lead
international fund managers to put a premium on French assets by selling the
franc.
Sterling profited from the D-Mark's weakness, rising 2 pfennigs on the day
to DM2.5225. Better than expected figures for the public sector deficit in
July helped bond markets, pushing the currency upwards. Dealers continued to
think that the pound's recent fall may have bottomed out.
The dollar was also a beneficiary of D-Mark profit-taking, ending at
DM1.6960 from a previous DM1.6865. It finished New York trading at DM1.6927.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lithuanian land reform yields
crop of problems - Undersized farms are unable to meet output requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITHUANIA'S agricultural economy proves the trite maxim that the trick is in
the construction. Destruction was the easy part.
In 1991, the largest Baltic state started breaking up the collectives. The
stated goals were: first, to make a dislocated sector competitive; and,
second, to raise output by returning land to former owners.
On both counts, the approach has failed, and not repeating its mistakes may
be the lingering lesson for former Soviet-bloc states in similar straits.
Speed was never a problem. The 1,058 collectives were quickly split up into
413,000 plots of no more than 3 hectares each. So far about 80 per cent of
state agricultural assets have been privatised. The generous land
restitution scheme has created 104,000 new private family farms - in a
country of only 3.7m people.
Production plummeted last year. The 1992 grain and potato harvests, for
example, were down to 66 per cent and 72 per cent of the 1991 level
respectively. Expectations for 1993, a wet season, are only slightly better.
Other sectors reveal similar drops.
'The collectives have been destroyed. What instead? No one knows,' says Mr
Czeslaw Okinczyc, a former member of parliament. 'Chaotic agricultural
reforms have brought down the industry.'
But low output figures, seen across the former Soviet Union, were expected,
if not to this extent. Lithuania, under Soviet rule, was assigned to produce
surplus meat, milk and poultry products and to depend on grain shipments
from other republics, mainly Ukraine. Autonomy does not come overnight.
Western aid - now totalling Dollars 48.7m, of which Dollars 3.80m comes from
the European Community's Phare program - is helping to develop private
production, free-market principles and broader trading links. These were
anticipated problem areas.
The Achilles' heel has been land reform. The state unilaterally promised to
restore owners, and their numerous offspring, to their pre-1939 plots. So
large tracts of land were broken up into small farms, many of which cannot
compete in either the domestic or foreign market.
The average farm size dropped to 9 hectares this summer, but it has not
bottomed out. Demand for plots appears to be insatiable: 450,000
applications for land restitution are still pending.
At this rate Lithuania may be severely crippled. A healthy agricultural
economy, according to western experts, requires average farm sizes
comfortably above 10 hectares. Of course, products like strawberries and
flowers need little space, but self-sufficiency demands diversity.
'If they continue dividing land for privatisation's sake,' says Mr Johannes
Ostergaard, an EC consultant at the Ministry of Agriculture, 'they'll go
down to 6 hectares - and that's not reasonable'.
Denmark, a small but developed country, is often used as the benchmark for
the Balts. Average farm size in Denmark is about 40 hectares and rising.
Lithuania may be wise to match that figure, post-Soviet politics permitting.
The new government, dominated by the old nomenklatura, understands the
predicament. Parliament recently prohibited division of farmland below 20
hectares. Other forms of compensation now have to be found.
They do not have to look far. In Latvia and Estonia, the other two Baltic
states, land was sold to the highest bidders while former owners were
compensated with shares in industrial enterprises.
But Lithuanian officials deny that the process went too fast and too far.
'We believe people will work better now,' says Mr Virgilijus Skulskis,
privatisation director at the Ministry of Agriculture. 'Our people don't
understand their enterprises are private yet.'
Indeed, psychology rather than economics resonates more powerfully, even
among experts. 'All farms in the United States and Denmark started small,'
explains Ms Onute Babraviciene, the country director for the US non-profit
group, Volunteers in Overseas Co-operative Assistance.
'They have to feel what it's like to be private. People are so proud to be
farmers.'
Co-operatives, now a political hot potato, are a possible future solution.
Ms Babraviciene, whose group promotes this idea, says 'people who can see
that's difficult to be alone will be the leaders of the future'.
Ultimately, however, the open market may provide the answer. "Farmers with 2
or 5 hectares will not want to be farmers,' said Mr Skulskis, who hopes
large agribusiness concerns eventually will consolidate many small farms.
Yet with unexpected hurdles put in the way, the transition to a healthy
agricultural economy may now take more than the one or two years originally
expected.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers pin hopes on
export curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICAN COFFEE producers, who have lost more than Dollars 1bn a year since
the collapse of an international export quota system in 1989, hope their
fortunes will be revived by an agreement to withhold 20 per cent of their
output, which was signed alongside Latin American producers in Kampala
yesterday.
The accord, due to take effect on October 1, will be open-ended. 'We intend
to maintain the retention scheme until we reach our target price,' said Mr
Guy-Alain Gauze, the Ivory Coast's coffee minister and chairman of the
Kampala meeting. He would not reveal the target price but said stocks would
be released slowly on to the market when prices improved.
The success of the scheme will depend on world coffee prices rallying high
enough to finance the costs of withholding exports. Each country will be
responsible for its own retention scheme. The participants agreed to meet in
Brasilia on September 23 and 24 to hammer out the details of policing the
plan.
If the plan succeeds, 10m bags of 60 kg will be withheld from the world
market during the 1993-94 crop year. Stocks in importing countries were
estimated to stand at over 20m bags last March. Half of the stocks are held
in the US, with most of the balance in Europe.
The agreement in Kampala was the first to unite coffee producers since the
breakdown of the International Coffee Agreement four years ago. It was
brought about by dire necessity, as global coffee earnings have fallen to
below Dollars 6bn from their peak of Dollars 11bn in the mid-1980s. Even
Indonesia, which has shunned commodity pacts in the past, attended the
Kampala meeting as an observer. Indonesian delegates said they supported the
principle of retaining production.
'For four years the Ivory Coast has been exporting at a loss,' Mr Gauze
said. 'We could sustain this state of affairs no longer.' The Ivory Coast is
Africa's biggest coffee exporter, despite a steep decline in production,
from 284,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to 192,000 tonnes in the 1992-93 season,
according to the US Department of Agriculture.
The 25 nations of the Inter-Africa Coffee Organisation produce about a fifth
of the world's coffee. But the slump in world prices and the costly workings
of cumbersome state marketing boards have led a growing number of African
coffee farmers to abandon their plantations in search of more profitable
cash crops. The continent's 1992-93 production of 1.03m tonnes was 16 per
cent lower than the 1989-90 crop.
Even before the agreement, African governments were implementing reforms
designed to give coffee farmers a better deal. In Kenya, producer of
Africa's finest Arabica coffee, farmers have been allowed to keep half their
earnings in foreign currency since the beginning of the year. They are no
longer forced to market their beans via the state Coffee Board of Kenya.
Most of the large coffee estates are now selling their produce directly at
the auction houses in Nairobi, cutting the expense of middlemen.
Even so, Kenya's coffee production has shrunk from 125,000 tonnes to 83,000
tonnes in five years.
Uganda's coffee earnings reached a nadir of Dollars 98m in 1992, compared
with average annual revenues of Dollars 300m between 1982 and 1989,
according to the Ministry of Finance's budget statement. In a bid to revive
the sector, the government abolished export taxes on coffee last year,
liberalised producer prices and licensed private traders. Even greater
efforts are being expended to diversify exports away from coffee, which
still earns 60 per cent of Uganda's hard currency.
Some traders are questioning the benefits of the retention scheme for
countries like Kenya, whose fine Arabica coffee fetches a hefty premium on
the world market. 'Prices this season have reached highs of Dollars 250 for
a 50 kilo bag,' says Ms Bridget Carrington, a trader with C. Doorman in
Nairobi. 'This is three times the price paid for Colombian or Central
American beans.'
If prices soar to new heights, Ms Carrington fears world roasters may reduce
the proportion of Kenyan coffee in their blends. She believes the retention
scheme may have the undesired effect of undermining demand for Kenya's prime
produce and depressing exports.
It is also unclear how Africa's cash-strapped governments are going to pay
for the build up in withheld coffee stocks.
Mr Peter Ngategize, the research and development manager of Uganda's Coffee
Development Authority, believes the financial costs of the retention scheme
should be born by exporters. 'But the government will probably have to
shoulder some of the expense,' he says. Private coffee traders are just
beginning to establish their business in Uganda and it would be unfair to
hit them with huge unforseen costs.
Mr Ngategize says the retention agreement will only work if the price gains
on the world market offset the cost of withholding stocks. But in Uganda's
case, he believes higher prices are only part of the solution.
'Our coffee plantations are old and in poor shape,' he says. 'We have to
invest in research and extension services to improve the quality and
productivity of our shambas (farms).'
Other delegates to the Kampala meeting chose to strike a note of caution.
'Commodity pacts have had a high failure rate in the past,' one participant
said. 'The retention scheme is a temporary solution, with problems of
sustainability.'

FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germans and Dutch get bulk of
CIS aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY AND the Netherlands have been given by far the biggest allocation of
aluminium from the Commonwealth of Independent States under the terms of
import restrictions imposed last week by the European Commission.
France, from where Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium group, led a campaign
for the EC to take action to 'safeguard' European producers, can import only
48 tonnes.
Traders complained yesterday that application of the ECrestrictions were
chaotic. Germany is already imposing rigid regulations but Italy is still
permitting unrestricted imports of CIS aluminium.
Meanwhile, protests about the EC's action continue to grow. Mr Alan Bekhor,
managing director of Trans-World Metals, which claims to be the biggest
trader in Russian aluminium, said the EC made no attempt to consult the
trading houses that handle most of the CIS aluminium exports before taking
action. He said the futility of the commission's attempt to limit the free
flow of a global commodity was illustrated by the fact that aluminium's
price had fallen by Dollars 30 a tonne since restrictions were imposed on
August 7.
The commission says that only 60,000 tonnes of CIS aluminium may be imported
to the EC between then and the end of November. Germany, whose manufacturing
industry is a big consumer, has been allocated 25,210 tonnes and the
Netherlands - the arrival point for most of the CIS metal coming into Europe
 -24,552.
Other allocations include: Denmark and Ireland, nil; Italy 5,778 tonnes;
Belgium and Luxembourg 1,254 tonnes; Greece 454 tonnes; Spain 1,548 tonnes;
Portugal 306 tonnes and the UK 762 tonnes. Once imported the metal can be
freely transferred between EC countries.
Mr Bekhor has written to Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external
economic relations, suggesting that the imposition of restrictions
'demonstrates how far the EC commission has become little more than the
instrument of the depressed European producer lobbies'.
He points out that, as EC aluminium production totals only 2m tonnes
compared with consumption of about 4m tonnes, 'the EC proposal will hurt
twice as many people as it is presumed to benefit.'
Mr Bekhor said yesterday that the commission's decision was based on
outdated information. The price of alumina (aluminium oxide) had been
deregulated and energy prices were also gradually being freed. Transport
costs were rising - it now cost Dollars 25 a tonne to ship aluminium from
Siberia to the coast compared with Dollars 1 under the old Soviet regime.
Significantly, CIS aluminium exports had stabilised at about 1m tonnes a
year and the marketing of Russian metal had been so effective that the EC
was no longer importing most of it. The bulk was now attracted to Japan and
the US, which did not impose the 6 per cent import duty levied by the EC.
This trend was accelerated after the US granted CIS republics 'most favoured
nation status' in June last year.
Western traders had been helping the CIS industry regain stability. For
example, Trans-World had provided pre-payments to CIS smelters when they
were short of hard currency to buy raw materials a year ago.
Mr Bekhor said that aluminium was one of the most robust, profitable and
efficient industries in the CIS. Many smelters had plans to improve their
processes and to cut pollution. 'The EC has made a very bad decision based
on a seriously flawed report. The consequences have not been thought through
and this will become a very big public issue because it is such a scandal'.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Floating krone lifts Danish
farm prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday raised Danish farm prices by 2.2 per cent,
as part of the system for frequent adjustment of 'green' currency rates
adopted in the wake of the August 2 decision to set 15 per cent fluctuation
bands for the European exchange rate mechanism currencies.
The new agrimonetary dispensation recognises all EC currencies as floating
within a wide 15 per cent band, and the commission now reviews farm price
conversion rates every three trading days. If the monetary gap between any
two member states exceeds 6 per cent during these periods, either or both of
the currencies get their green rate changed if individually they have
revalued or depreciated by more than two percentage points.
The current adjustment, based on trading on August 12, 13 and 16, is to plug
the gap between the Dutch guilder, which commission figures show
appreciating by 1.92 per cent against its central rate, and a krone
depreciation of 4.29 per cent. The green krone was revalued by 0.8 per cent
on August 11, along with the agricultural conversion rate for the French
franc, which rose by 1.8 per cent.
Prior to the latest turmoil in the ERM, the Commission was reviewing green
rates about three times a month, but purely for the weaker currencies inside
the ERM, the peseta and the escudo, and those floating outside it, sterling,
the lira and the drachma.

<TEXT>
Lower London Metal Exchange COPPER and ALUMINIUM prices during the afternoon
uncovered good buying interest, which resulted in busy markets and, in
copper's case, a final rally. Traders said a late afternoon collapse in
copper prices was due to US-based selling touching off liquidation and
stop-loss selling orders, which pushed the three months delivery price down
to Dollars 1,895, against an earlier high of Dollars 1,913. But strong
buying below Dollars 1,900 eventually turned the market and last business
was at an unchanged Dollars 1,905 a tonne. Aluminium eased to the day's lows
in the early afternoon after news that the closure-threatened
263,000-tonnes-a-year Romanian smelter had only been operating at 110,000
tonnes a year. The three months position dipped to Dollars 1,186 a tonne but
good trade buying was evident below Dollars 1,190. COCOA futures closed
lower in London, depressed by another failed attempt in New York to breach
key resistance at Dollars 1,017 a tonne for the December futures position.
The strength of sterling also added to the downward pressure.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Better-than-expected PSBR boosts
long-dated gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMBINATION of better-than-expected borrowing figures and general
enthusiasm over the inflation outlook helped to boost long-dated UK
government bonds by three-quarters of a point yesterday.
Short-dated gilts were little changed as the market's attention shifted from
hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate to the good inflation background
and yesterday's release of the July public sector borrowing requirement
figure.
The PSBR figure of Pounds 1.5bn was below market expectations of Pounds
1.8bn to Pounds 1.9bn, helped by proceeds from the sale of the third tranche
of shares in British Telecommunications.
Economists pointed out that the latest Confederation of British Industry
survey, published yesterday, indicated economic recovery without the threat
of a pick-up in inflation, a scenario which was warmly welcomed by the gilt
market.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 113.01 and reached a high of
113.24 before slipping to 113.21 by late afternoon. With the rally
concentrated on longer-dated stocks, the gilt yield curve flattened.
FRENCH government bonds ended lower on the day, despite the Banque de
France's half-point cut in the overnight rate to 8.75 per cent yesterday
morning. While the franc strengthened on the news, the bond market sold off
as both domestic and international investors took profits.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German bond market closed higher on the day, more
than making up for early weakness. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at
97.15, and rose to a high of 97.37 before ending at around 97.35.
MR JOHN Dawkins, the Australian Treasurer, forecast higher-than-expected
inflation in his budget speech yesterday, which had a negative impact on
government bonds.
He said the consumer price index (CPI) was expected to rise by 3.5 per cent
in the fiscal year 1993-94. The market had expected a CPI rise of between
2.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent.
Bond prices fell on the news, with the yield on the 9.5 per cent bond due
2003 rising to 6.87 per cent, from 6.80 per cent just before the budget
speech.
The Australian government projected a budget deficit of ADollars 16bn for
the year ending June 30 1994, widening from a revised deficit of ADollars
14.6bn in the 1992 - 93 fiscal year.
JAPANESE bonds saw volatile trading, taking their cue from the yen, but
ended little changed on the day. The yen strengthened to a post-war high of
Y100.25 to the US dollar, before slipping back.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.065 per cent and traded
in a range of 4.03 to 4.11 per cent before ending at 4.07 per cent.
In the futures market, the December contract reached a high of 111.22 and
ended Tokyo trading little changed at 110.90, but slipped back in London to
110.72.
AFTER early gains, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell back on
disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not add reserves to the system.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 99
1/4 , yielding 6.304 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 1/16 at 100 15/32 , to yield 3.980 per cent.
The market lacked a firm direction in morning trading, but longer-dated
securities maintained their upward momentum. The gains sent yields on the
30-year bond to record lows. Traders said the strength was primarily due to
buying in anticipation of a coupon pass by the Fed, which would involve the
central bank buying Treasury coupons outright.
In the afternoon long prices fell back when a coupon pass failed to
materialise. The losses, however, were minimal, and trading remained light
throughout the session.

FT  18 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark expected to launch
tightly-priced Dollars 1bn FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market expects the Kingdom of Denmark to launch an
aggressively-priced Dollars 1bn issue of four-year floating-rate notes
(FRNs) today.
Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National
Bank, confirmed that the notes would pay interest below the London interbank
offered rate (Libor) but declined to say by how much. The market expects the
coupon to pay up to  3/16 of a point below Libor.
Mr Sorensen declined to say which bank had been awarded the mandate for the
offering, Denmark's third transaction in the international bond issue in as
many weeks.
The proceeds from the notes will be used to replenish the country's foreign
exchange reserves. They were depleted by heavy currency intervention in
recent weeks to help restore stability to the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Yesterday, the Province of Ontario and the European Investment Bank (EIB)
succeeded in raising cheaper funding than usual when they swapped the
proceeds of two international bond issues which raised Pounds 255m and
CDollars 500m respectively.
In what is known as a 'back-to-back' or 'parallel' deal, Ontario and the EIB
used their rarity value in the sterling and Canadian dollar sectors to
achieve fairly aggressive terms on their seven-year offerings.
The two borrowers then ultimately took on the other's liabilities, so that
Ontario ended up with Canadian dollars and the EIB with sterling at much
lower interest rates than they would have done had they raised the funds
directly in the market. Both borrowers were believed to have achieved a
saving of at least 10 basis points.
Officials at the joint lead managers, BZW and Salomon Brothers, said that
demand for both bond issues was good but that Ontario's bonds were selling
faster because of the current lack of supply in the Eurosterling market.
As a result, when Ontario's bonds were freed to trade, their yield spread
over the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2000 tightened to around 32 basis
points from 35 basis points at pricing.
However, the yield spread over the underlying Canadian Treasury on the EIB's
bonds widened to around 14 basis points from 12 basis points at pricing.
Officials at Ontario's borrowing department said that after yesterday's
transaction the province had completed just over half of its CDollars 10bn
borrowing needs for fiscal 1993.
The State Bank of New South Wales also tapped the Canadian dollar sector
with a 10-year, CDollars 150m offering which was priced to yield 52 basis
points over the underlying Canadian Treasuries. The deal was arranged by
Merrill Lynch, which also lead-managed a Dollars 200m issue of FRNs for
Finnish Export Credit.
An official at Merrill Lynch said that the notes were likely to be taken up
by holders of an earlier FRN issue by the same borrower, since those notes
are expected to be called in December 1994.

FT  18 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Globex backers split over
withdrawal of Liffe from talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange's exit from
discussions to join Globex last week has split the three backers of the
electronic after-hours futures trading system.
The Chicago Board of Trade's refusal to let Liffe list its German bund
contract on Globex has angered its Globex partners, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Reuters, the electronic information group, prompting
speculation that Reuters may seek other exchanges to become primary partners
in the system.
Although the CBoT and the CME control Globex's content and development,
Reuters has invested an estimated Dollars 78m in the system, which it
intends to recover from transactions fees.
Liffe, with its lively trade in bund and Euromark futures would have added
much-needed volume to Globex. The CBoT intends to trade bund futures on its
own trading floor sometime in the future.
Describing the current situation as 'volatile', Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's
chairman, said the exchange was ready to re-open negotiations with Globex if
the issue of listing Liffe's bund contracts were resolved.
In letters to Mr Patrick Arbor, the chairman of CBoT, Reuters and Mr Jack
Sander, CME's chairman, have suggested that the CBoT's action was
self-interested and at odds with Globex's goals.
'We believe the position on bund contracts you have taken with Liffe is
inconsistent with the Globex agreement,' a Reuters executive wrote in a
letter to Mr Arbor on August 2, a week before the Liffe discussions were
terminated.
In a reply to Reuters, Mr Arbor, wrote: 'In considering the best interest of
the Globex system, the Board of Trade is not required to ignore its own best
interests.' Mr Arbor could not be reached for comment yesterday, but Mr
Thomas Donovan, CBoT's president, said the exchange remained committed to
Globex.
During its first year of operation, which ended in June, Globex had volume
of 1.294m contracts, far below projections. Half of that volume originated
on Matif, the French futures exchange. The CME generated two-thirds of the
remaining volume, with the CBoT the smallest contributor.
It is unlikely that the North American exchanges will be able to meet a
contractual agreement with Reuters to produce 50,000 or more in volume per
night by April 1994. If that goal is not met, Reuters or the exchanges will
be free to terminate the contract. If so, Reuters could seek other partners
in the system.

THE Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of
the late Sir Y. T. Pao, yesterday announced a 44 per cent increase in net
profit to HKDollars 1.38bn (USDollars 178m) for the six months ended June.
Operating profit was boosted by a HKDollars 478m pre-tax profit from the
sale of the International Bank of Asia building and a portion of Wharf Cable
Tower.
Wharf has interests in infrastructure, transport and communications, but has
recently focused on enhancing returns from its land bank.
The company will complete 9m square feet of new property within the next
four years, compared with its existing 7m sq ft of investment property.
Next month, Wharf's giant Times Square retail and office project will open.
The company estimates the property will provide a recurrent income stream of
HKDollars 700m at current market prices.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Californian insurer loses battle over rebates
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLSTATE Insurance yesterday became the biggest insurer to concede defeat in
the battle with Californian regulators over Proposition 103, the
controversial state legislation which decided that premiums on motor and
other types of property/casualty insurance should be rolled back, and
rebates made.
Allstate and the California Department of Insurance said the company had
agreed to repay Dollars 110m in rebates to 2.9m policyholders who held
policies in the year to November 1989. This represents 5.3 per cent of the
company's written premiums during the period.
The agreement marks the biggest single victory for Mr John Garamendi, the
politically-ambitious Californian insurance commissioner, in his battle with
insurance companies over rebates under Proposition 103, which was passed in
1988 on a 'voter initiative'. It takes to 7m the number of people who will
have received rebates.
Allstate, which had been one of the most vociferous opponents of the
legislation, said it had decided to settle to put the dispute behind it. The
cost of the settlement, which had been provided for in previous years, would
not affect 1993 earnings. The company will pay rebates averaging Dollars 66
on each auto policy, Dollars 26 per homeowners policy, and Dollars 207 on
each commercial policy.
Mr Garamendi, while welcoming the settlement, said: 'This agreement should
send a signal (to other insurers) that either through the courts or directly
with companies, we will see to it that rebates are paid.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO big US store chains, Texas-based JC Penney and Minnesota's Dayton
Hudson, yesterday revealed a decline in core retailing margins during the
second quarter of 1992, providing further evidence that the US retail
industry remains highly competitive.
Dayton Hudson, which takes in a mixture of department stores and discount
outlets, said that after-tax profits in the three months to end-July fell to
Dollars 24m, compared with Dollars 42m a year earlier.
Sales were Dollars 4.29bn, compared with Dollars 4bn. Net earnings would
have been even lower, at Dollars 19m, but for the inclusion of a
non-recurring credit.
Mr Kenneth Macke, Dayton's chairman, said that the company was 'very
disappointed' with the second-quarter performance overall.
He added that the Target discount stores, which form the largest division,
performed well, with operating profits improving on a 5 per cent increase in
same-store sales. But even here, gross margins fell due to price reductions,
part of a strategy of 'value-pricing'.
Target did, however, see some improvement in the 'mark-down' rate, and its
operating expense ratio also showed a slight improvement.
The other two divisions - the department stores and the Mervyn's chain  -
both reported a fall in operating profits and deteriorating gross margins.
The second-quarter results mean that Dayton's first-half earnings stand at
Dollars 54m after tax, down from Dollars 77m at the same stage last year.
Sales in the first half were Dollars 8.33bn, compared with Dollars 7.69bn.
At JC Penney, after-tax earnings reached Dollars 112m in the second quarter,
an improvement on the Dollars 80m in the same period of 1992, while sales
rose to Dollars 3.96bn, against Dollars 3.79bn.
However, the company said that the advance was due to 'an outstanding
performance' by the catalogue division, lower expenses and a 'significant
rise' in the profitability of the insurance division.
Gross margins, as a percentage of sales, fell to 31.7 per cent from 32.4 per
cent a year ago.
Mr William Howell, chairman, said that the decline was expected 'because the
company's strategy in the intensely competitive retail environment has been
to stress unit sales and lower initial price points'.
On Wall Street, shares in JC Penney closed up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 3/4
on the news, while Dayton Hudson lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/4.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANON, the Japanese copier and camera maker, is to seek further operating
activities abroad. Yesterday, it blamed the strength of the yen for a 61 per
cent slide in interim pre-tax profits, to Y15.54bn (Dollars 151m).
Sales were down just 2.6 per cent, at Y493.9bn, for the six months to June.
The company said the rise in the yen over the period had a Y50bn negative
effect on export revenues, which it managed in part to cover through price
increases and cost cuts.
Canon is to seek ways to transfer research and development, as well as
production bases, overseas. It also wants to open joint ventures with
companies abroad. The company already has research centres in Britain,
France, the US and Australia, and manufactures in several countries.
Its only area of revenue growth in the half-year was in computer
peripherals. Copiers were slightly lower, but camera sales fell by a
quarter.
Net earnings fell 48.1 per cent to Y11.58bn. For the full year, it is
maintaining an earlier forecast of a 0.3 per cent dip in sales, to Y1,060bn;
pre-tax profits down 50.7 per cent to Y38bn; and net earnings 48.1 per cent
weaker at Y21bn. The dividend is being held at Y12.50, of which Y6.25 is
being paid now.
Cosmo Securities, the financially-troubled Japanese second-tier broker, is
to issue 243.75m new shares worth Y78bn in a third party allotment to Daiwa
Bank. Daiwa announced last week it would rescue Cosmo, which last year made
an extraordinary loss of Y69.8bn.
The bank will buy the stocks at Y320 per share.

Wharf yesterday unveiled its plans for the further redevelopment of its
Harbour City complex. It will tear down three residential blocks, and
replace them with three 33-storey office towers. These will sit above a
retail podium. The combined floor area will be 2.5m sq ft. Work will start
in 1994.
On October 31, it will launch Hong Kong's first cable television network,
after receiving a licence five months ago. The group is determined to expand
into communications, and has launched a bid for the licence for Hong Kong's
second telecommunications network.
Group profits for the second half of the year will be boosted by the
proceeds of the sale of its Parc Oasis residential development in Singapore.
The directors recommended an interim dividend of 19 cents a share, compared
with 16.5 cents in 1992.
It was announced that Mr Peter Woo would step down as chairman in 1994, and
assume the position of honorary chairman, previously held by his late
father-in-law, Sir Y. K. Pao. He will be replaced by chief executive Mr
Gonzaga Li.
Mr Woo will remain chairman of Wharf's parent company World International.

Dollars 513m charge

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NAVISTAR International, the Chicago-based truck and engine manufacturer
which recently negotiated a landmark agreement to cut workers'
post-retirement benefits, reported a net loss of Dollars 312m, or Dollars
9.99 a common share, for its third quarter.
The loss reflected a one-time charge of Dollars 513m related to the new
benefits plan. Excluding the charge, the company's operating results
improved in the third quarter.
Before the special charge, pre-tax operating income rose to Dollars 11m, up
from a loss of Dollars 49m in the third quarter of 1992. The 1992 quarter
included a Dollars 24m charge related to a vehicle recall.
Consolidated sales from the company's manufacturing and financial services
operations totalled Dollars 1.12bn, up 22 per cent from Dollars 917m in the
1992 third quarter.
Mr James Cotting, chairman, said: 'The improvement in year-over-year
operating results is the result of increased demand across the board in all
of our businesses.'
The company said that shipments of mid-range diesel engines increased 30 per
cent in the quarter, while retail sales of medium and heavy trucks rose 28
per cent, to 80,600 units.
Navistar on July 1 implemented a new post-retirement benefits plan, which it
expects will reduce its liability for retiree healthcare and life insurance
to about Dollars 1.1bn worldwide, down from Dollars 2.6bn.

FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Exercise in reassurance at
Nippon Credit - The bank hopes that its new president will restore its image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HIROSHI Kubota, the new president of Nippon Credit Bank, has an
impeccable reputation as a senior bureaucrat. The bank clearly hopes that
his presence will lend credibility to claims that the worst of NCB's
bad-loan problems are over.
Mr Kubota makes it clear that he was not parachuted in by a finance ministry
fearful that the bank was collapsing. He says he took the decision himself
after an approach from NCB, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks.
Through the reassuring Mr Kubota, the bank has begun a campaign to convince
the outside world that reports of its problems are exaggerated, and to
suggest that one reason for unwanted attention is that it has been
forthcoming in dealing with non-performing loans.
NCB estimates that its own problem loans are around Y592bn (Dollars 5.86bn),
while links to ailing housing loan corporations and to three finance company
affiliates have created another Y500bn in non-performing loans. At Y1,100bn,
non-performing loans amount to around 10 per cent of the parent bank's total
loans, but the narrow definition of problem loans in Japan has given rise to
suspicions that the burden is far heavier.
One sign of financial institutions' concerns is that the interest rate in
the secondary market for five-year debentures issued by NCB has crept about
0.3 per cent above that of the Industrial Bank of Japan. The two banks
issued the debentures at the same rate, but NCB's much-publicised problems
have created, by Japanese standards, an unusual and embarrassing distinction
between the two institutions.
Bridging that interest rate gap would be a sign of the effectiveness of Mr
Kubota, who aims to reduce NCB's problem loans to zero within the next three
to four years - an ambitious goal given the deterioration of the Japanese
property market, the source of many of the bank's ills.
Clearing away the financial debris from the bubble era of the late 1980s -
when NCB, along with many other Japanese banks, funded speculative property
developments - is only part of Mr Kubota's brief. He also must restore the
reputation of a bank that confesses to having a 'bad image'.
After joining the finance ministry in 1954, Mr Kubota spent time as an
inspector in the banking bureau and rose to become director-general of the
National Tax Administration Agency. That background means that he knows a
bank balance sheet, and his positive judgment of NCB's difficulties has had
a calming influence, although it has not yet cleared away all concerns.
Instead of emphasising the bad-loan figures, NCB points to a 68 per cent
rise in core banking profits, to Y90.8bn, for the year ended March, due to a
fall in official interest rates which created a favourable spread.
Net profit fell 58 per cent to Y13.3bn after Y70bn in provisions and
write-offs, which the bank said showed its determination to deal with its
loan portfolio.
Mr Kubota admits that the interest rate spreads may not be as favourable
this year, but says the bank will generate profits through increased
business in east Asia, which he recently toured: 'It is easier to generate
new business in Asia than in a place like New York. Of course, New York is
still very large and important, but Japanese companies are very interested
in Asia now.'
The new president also sees longer-term profits in domestic property, which
he thinks will be stimulated by the need for urban redevelopment. The future
emphasis, he says, will not just be on lending but in providing 'value-added
services' in development, which would take advantage of the bank's
traditional expertise.
In the shorter term, the property market could continue to be a source of
worry for the bank. Property loans account for 21.5 per cent of lending, and
Tokyo Shoko Research, a private credit research company, estimates that
NCB's total property-related exposure is 23.8 per cent, the second-highest
of leading Japanese banks.
The high level of exposure partly reflects the bank's past. From 1957 to
1977, NCB was known as the Nippon Fudosan Bank, or the Japan Property Bank.
It was originally the Bank of Chosen, the central bank of Japanese-occupied
Korea from 1909 to 1945, and was in charge of issuing bank notes in
Manchuria, northern China.
Japan's residential property market is showing signs of recovery, with
demand for new apartments on the rise, but commercial property prices have
fallen about 20 per cent in the past year, and appear set to fall further as
large projects commissioned during the late 1980s are progressively
completed.
One sign of the continuing troubles in the property market is the inability
of the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company to sell property collateral.
The CCPC was established by NCB and other Japanese banks in January to buy
their non-performing property-related loans, and to put a floor under
property prices by announcing details of collateral sales. In the period
from January to July, the CCPC bought Y502.58bn in loan credits from banks,
but recovered only Y920m in collateral.

DEGUSSA, the metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday warned there would
be no recovery in group profits in the last quarter of the financial year as
it reported a fall in pre-tax earnings by 26 per cent to DM121m (Dollars
70.3m) in the nine months to the end of June.
The group blamed the decline on reforms in the German healthcare sector,
combined with the effects of the worldwide recession on its metals
businesses.
It said there was no way it would be able to catch up the shortfall in
profits in the rest of the financial year.
In contrast to the fall in earnings, group sales rose strongly, up by 13 per
cent to DM10.7bn. But Degussa said that the bulk of the increase was due to
sharply increased precious metals trading and sales together with changes in
the companies included in the consolidated figures.
Stripping out these factors, turnover would have been just below the level
of the comparable period last year, Degussa said.
Losses in the metals division - which accounts for just over one-third of
group turnover excluding precious metals - were 'markedly higher' than last
year, Degussa said, reflecting weak demand amid the recessionary
environment. There was a slight improvement in profits from the chemicals
division.

FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forestry and energy group, said a
significant boost in log prices helped it post an annual result ahead of
expectations and the group is well-positioned for the future, Reuter reports
from Wellington.
FCL reported a bottom line profit of NZDollars 381.8m (USDollars 210.88m) in
the year to June 30, against a loss of NZDollars 157.5m a year ago. The
result included a pre-tax abnormal gain of NZDollars 15.5m from a loss of
NZDollars 472.8m a year ago.
Mr Ron Trotter, chairman, said the result was significantly ahead of
expectations.
'We received a significant boost from the sharp rise in international log
and lumber prices during the second half of the year,' he said.
The result was also boosted by a NZDollars 178.69m tax credit compared with
a NZDollars 141.72m credit a year ago.
Net earnings excluding abnormals were steady at NZDollars 302.8m, compared
with NZDollars 305.1m last year. Abnormal items gave a net after-tax gain of
NZDollars 79m in the period. Gains included NZDollars 234m on the sale of
Fletcher Challenge Methanol, NZDollars 85m on the sale of 49 per cent in
newsprint and forestry operations in Chile, NZDollars 74m from transactions
with the Natural Gas Corporation Ltd and NZDollars 24m from the sale of
Rural Bank.
Losses included NZDollars 227m on the write-down of the carrying values of
UK Paper and NZDollars 80m of restructuring costs.

HEWLETT-PACKARD yesterday reported a 44 per cent increase in third-quarter
earnings, but failed to live up to Wall Street's more optimistic
projections. The computer and electronics group's stock fell sharply to
trade at Dollars 71 1/8 at midday, down from Monday's close of Dollars 75
1/4 .
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.06 per share,
well below analysts' projections of around Dollars 1.20 per share. In the
third quarter last year, net earnings were Dollars 188m, or 75 cents.
Expectations for HP's third quarter had been inflated by the strong rate of
growth in orders placed during the first half, despite earlier warnings that
it expected slower order growth in the third quarter.
The rate decline, from 26 per cent in the first half to 19 per cent in the
third quarter, was nonetheless 'a bit disappointing', said Mr Lew Platt, HP
president and chief executive.
Order growth slowed substantially in Europe and slightly in Japan, he said.
However it remained 'healthy' in the US.
Net revenue for the third quarter grew 23 per cent to Dollars 5bn from
Dollars 4bn in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue in the US was Dollars
2.4bn, up 28 per cent, while international revenues totaled Dollars 2.6bn,
an increase of 18 per cent from a year ago. International sales growth was
dampened by sluggish sales in Europe, the company said.
'Our results are a major improvement over last year's third quarter, with
profit margins up and earnings growing faster than revenue,' said Mr Platt.
Operating expenses rose only 9 per cent, despite revenue growth of 23 per
cent, due to tight expense controls, he added. 'We've been working to create
a leaner, more productive company, and this result shows real progress
toward that goal.'
The company was unhappy, however, with a sharp rise in third-quarter
inventory levels, particularly in its personal computer printer group, which
stockpiled parts in anticipation of a strong fourth-quarter seasonal surge
in sales.
For the first nine months, net revenue increased 21 per cent to Dollars
14.6bn. Net earnings rose 8 per cent to Dollars 879m, or Dollars 3.47 per
share, from Dollars 813m, or Dollars 3.21, in the same period last year.
Comparisons exclude the effect of a Dollars 332m after-tax charge last year
for a change in accounting standards for retirement benefits.
Mr Platt said improved profitability remained the company's top goal. 'Our
new product programs are aimed at pursuing and creating revenue growth
opportunities,' he said.

return

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE Bank, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday announced a return to
profit and said preparations for reprivatisation could commence this autumn.
DnB achieved a first-half net profit of NKr204m (Dollars 27.72m) against a
net loss of NKr1.16bn last year due to improved net interest income, strong
gains on securities due to a sharp decline in domestic interest rates and
improved efficiency.
Mr Ole Lund, chairman, stressed the bank must achieve stable profits from
'basic banking' operations before a programme for a gradual return to
private hands could be completed by early next spring. The timetable would
be influenced by the third-quarter performance.
Following a six-year banking crisis in the Nordic region, DnB's ended up
with a 70 per cent stake acquired in return for numerous cash bail-outs.
Last April, the bank received a state cash injection of NKr1.5bn in
preference capital. DnB was also granted a state guarantee of NKr600m which,
Mr Lund said, it would not have to call on.
Net interest income rose by NKr296m to NKr2.64bn. Other operating income -
gains on shares, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments - shot up
by NKr780m to NKr1.87bn as operating expenses contracted by NKr172m to
NKr2.25bn achieved by nearly five years of wide cost cutting.
Mr Finn Hvistendahl, president, said he knew of no other large bank which
could point to similar cost effectiveness. However, the bank is still
saddled with credit losses which, at NKr2bn in the first six months of this
year, remained unchanged from last year.
Net non-performing loans increased to NKr12.12bn by end-June from NKr11.6bn
at end-1992 due to a reclassification of 'doubtful' loans to non-performers.

<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African-controlled company that dominates the world
diamond industry, is maintaining its dividend at 25.2 US cents a share
following improved earnings in the half-year to June.
Although the company continues to be very cautious about prospects for the
second half, the outlook is much better than a year ago when De Beers caused
a furore by announcing, unexpectedly, that a weak market would force a
substantial cut in the final dividend.
The balance sheet has also strengthened, showing an overall improvement of
Dollars 963m following a decline in borrowings and an improvement in net
current assets. The finances of De Beers were weakened in 1992 when it was
forced to spend large sums stabilising the open diamond market.
A year ago, at the time of the dividend warning, the company was suffering
from an unexpected economic weakening in leading markets and a glut of
illicit supply from Angola.
The diamond account was largely unchanged from the same period in 1992, with
income of Dollars 373m against Dollars 379m. An improvement in South African
operations, following increased production from the new Venetia mine and the
benefits of downsizing at the other mines, was offset by a weaker
performance from Centenary, which holds the non-South African assets -
mostly in Botswana and Namibia.
Weakness in the South African economy caused investment income from
interests outside the diamond industry to fall to Dollars 111m from Dollars
139m. Interest income also declined to Dollars 33m from Dollars 65m, leaving
pre-tax income 9 per cent lower at Dollars 444m against Dollars 473m.
A lower tax bill boosted attributable income which rose to Dollars 353m from
Dollars 325m in 1992. Earnings per share rose to 93 cents from 86 cents last
time.
Strong sales by the Central Selling Organisation, the marketing arm, of
Dollars 2.54bn in the first half of 1993, up from Dollars 1.79bn, helped
reduce diamond stocks by Dollars 527m to Dollars 3.24bn from Dollars 3.77bn
at the end of 1992. The balance sheet is thus likely to weaken again.

ENI, the Italian state energy and chemicals company due to be partly
privatised, is likely to report a group loss this year after losing L815bn
(Dollars 529m) in 1992.
However, in a letter accompanying its 1992 accounts, Mr Luigi Meanti,
chairman, suggests it may return to the black in 1994, partly because of
privatisation receipts.
Results for the first quarter suggest 1993 will be 'another difficult year,'
according the letter. Margins in the energy business have been eroded by the
weak oil price, while chemicals are still overshadowed by the recession.
Problems at the EniChem chemicals subsidiary, which lost L1,560bn in 1992,
were largely responsible for last year's Eni group losses, which compared
with net profits of L1,081bn in 1991. Poor performance in chemicals wiped
out earnings at Eni's profitable Agip and Snam oil and gas subsidiaries.
Mr Meanti said other parts of Eni's activities were likely to do better this
year, with higher earnings in engineering and services and some improvement
in the lossmaking metals and mining division.
This year's results will also be overshadowed by heavy restructuring costs
linked to the group's concentration on its core businesses, and sales of
non-strategic operations.
The group has already announced a string of asset sales, the biggest of
which is the Nuovo Pignone turbines and compressors subsidiary. Other
disposals, mainly of relatively small business units, are expected to raise
about L2,700bn for EniChem by the end of 1994 and about L1,000bn for the
Agip Petrol subsidiary.
Eni, which has been severely implicated in Italy's political corruption
scandal, is also trying to ascertain the size of kickbacks and other
off-balance sheet payments. Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's
biggest banks, said Mr Vincenzo Palladino, its deputy chairman, had
resigned.
Mr Palladino, a prominent Milan lawyer, was arrested last month in
connection with allegations of corruption regarding the former Enimont
chemicals joint venture between Eni and the private-sector Montedison group.

DEGUSSA, the metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday warned there will
be no recovery in group profits in the last quarter of the financial year as
it reported a fall in pre-tax earnings by 26 per cent to DM121m (Dollars
70.3m) in the nine months to the end of June.
The group blamed the decline on reforms in the German healthcare sector,
combined with the effects of the worldwide recession on its metals
businesses.
It said it saw no hope of a recovery in the world economy in the latter
months of the financial year. It said there was no way it would be able to
catch up the shortfall in profits in the rest of the financial year.
In contrast to the fall in earnings, group sales rose strongly, up by 13 per
cent to DM10.7bn. But Degussa said that the bulk of the increase was due to
sharply increased precious metals trading and sales together with changes in
the companies included in the consolidated figures.
Stripping out these factors, turnover would have been just below the level
of the comparable period last year, Degussa said.
Losses in the metals division - which accounts for just over one-third of
group turnover excluding precious metals - were 'markedly higher' than last
year, Degussa said, reflecting weak demand amid the recessionary
environment. There was a slight improvement in profits from the chemicals
division. In the healthcare division profits were 'substantially below'
prior-year figure.
Degussa, which has reduced its total number of employees from 33,500 to
31,760 over the year to the end of June despite a number of acquisitions,
vowed to maintain its programme of cost-reduction and restructuring. Wella,
the German haircare and cosmetics group, reported that group profits climbed
by 3 per cent to DM66m from DM64.1m in the first six months of the year,
whilst profits at the parent company dropped by 1.7 per cent to DM29m.
Escada, the German fashion group, expects to make a profit for the 1993 full
year, Reuter reports. This follows an operating loss of DM10m to DM15m in
the first six months of the year, according to Mr Wolfgang Ley, chief
executive.

DELL Computer, the personal computer manufacturer, reported its first
quarterly losses after charges of Dollars 71m to cover restructuring,
inventory write-offs and other adjustments for delayed and cancelled
products.
Losses for the quarter were Dollars 75.7m, or Dollars 2.03 a share, compared
with net income of Dollars 21.9m, or 57 cents, in the same period last year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 701m from Dollars 458m.
Dell, until now one of the fastest-growing companies in the computer
industry, had previously acknowledged problems with the development of
notebook computer products and announced plans for restructuring charges.
Other factors contributing to the second-quarter loss included a
'significant sell-off of excess inventory at substandard (profit) margins,'
the company said.

NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-owned bank, said falling interest rates and
rationalisation helped it achieve a SKr1.7bn (Dollars 211m) profit in the
first six months of the year. In the same 1992 period it suffered a SKr5.2bn
loss.
The figures are not strictly comparable as the bank's position has been
strengthened following a reconstruction at the start of the year when
SKr50bn of problem loans were transferred to a separate state entity called
Securum.
This cut the number of the bank's non-performing loans to a quarter of its
previous level and created the conditions for a strong recovery in
profitability.
Operating profit before credit losses rose to SKr4.52bn in the first half
from SKr1.39bn, reflecting an increase in net interest earnings and lower
costs.
Credit losses dropped sharply to SKr2.78bn from SKr6.61bn. Just over SKr1bn
of these losses were related to the transfer of assets and reserves to
Securum.
The bank said non-performing loans fell to SKr10.4bn at the end of June
compared with SKr11.1bn at the start of the year (excluding Securum). It
added that its pro-forma capital adequacy ratio increased from 8.9 per cent
to 10.0 per cent over the same period.
Nordbanken said its full-year result would exceed the half-year level,
although it warned that second-half profits would not be as large as in the
first six months. Last year, the bank suffered a SKr16.0bn operating loss,
the biggest deficit ever disclosed by a Swedish bank.
'The outlook seems good for even lower interest rates, which is good both
for customers borrowing from the bank and for the bank's investment

The government eventually intends to return Nordbanken to the private
sector, although it has not set a timetable for the move.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Two banks to advise on Brent Walker
disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the property and leisure group, yesterday announced the
appointment of two merchant banks to advise it on the possible flotation of
William Hill, which might value the betting shop chain at over Pounds 500m.
The banks are Hill Samuel, which is Brent Walker's existing adviser, and NM
Rothschild.
William Hill has to repay a Pounds 350m loan by March 1 1994, and a
flotation is one way of raising the money. Brent Walker has received a cash
bid of Pounds 360m for William Hill from a consortium of investors, led by
SG Warburg.
However, Brent Walker is keen to retain a stake in William Hill and had
talked of maintaining a 40 per cent shareholding. Bankers believe it would
not be possible for Brent Walker to keep more than a small interest or 'the
sums don't work out,' one said. Potential investors are likely to want to
see William Hill managed independently from Brent Walker and financially
viable on a stand-alone basis.
Brent Walker bought William Hill for Pounds 685m in 1989 from Grand
Metropolitan but is trying to reclaim Pounds 200m of the purchase price.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar Pounds 0.4m back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFE INDMAR, the Edinburgh-based engineer, yesterday reported a swing from
losses of Pounds 236,000 to profits of Pounds 424,000 pre-tax for the half
year to June 30.
The interim dividend is lifted by 0.25p to 0.75p from earnings of 2.7p
(losses 1.53p). The shares responded with a 15p rise to 60p.
Referring to the final dividend, which was passed last time, Mr Gavin
Hepburn, chairman, said the company was expecting to pay a final but that
this depended on the results for the second six months.
He said the positive profit swing of Pounds 660,000 was achieved on turnover
down 10 per cent at Pounds 15.1m. He added that prospects for the remainder
of the year 'remained encouraging for all four divisions.'
There was a continued good performance in the distribution division with
profit 'considerably ahead of the previous year.' Sluggish demand,
particularly from the Ministry of Defence, held back electro-mechanical
products but the division returned to profit in the opening period.
Engineering achieved break-even and losses in the catering equipment
operations were substantially reduced.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Quicks ahead despite patchy sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUICKS, the Manchester-based motor distributor which returned to the black
last year, continued its recovery with a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
for the first half of 1993.
They came to Pounds 1.38m, against Pounds 1.11m. Profits for the whole of
1992 were Pounds 2.06m following losses of Pounds 952,000 previously.
Mr Alec Murray, chief executive, said that car sales for the first half had
been fairly patchy. Margins were down and its was difficult to make money on
new cars.
But sales for August, the trade's busiest month, were running 10 per cent
ahead of his expectations so far. The second half would be 'far better than
the 1992 second half, which was nothing short of disastrous.'
Mr Murray expected used car sales to be 20 per cent ahead year on year,
while the after sales business, which accounted for 75 per cent of profits,
was doing well.
The overall market for commercial vehicles remained sluggish, but the
trading position of the Iveco Ford and Leyland Daf dealerships was
encouraging.
Midland dealerships again improved their profit performances. The group had
been awarded its first Japanese franchises.
Turnover fell from Pounds 99.4m to Pounds 98.5m. Last month the group bought
Laidlaw for Pounds 8.15m; it has five Ford dealerships in Scotland, Kent and
Essex and was expected to increase group turnover by 50 per cent.
Earnings per share were increased to 5.2p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is
2p (1.75p).
Analysts suggested yesterday that the group had suffered from its
traditional over-dependence on Ford, which had lost market share . But
management had introduced cost controls and rigorous management systems, and
the purchase of Laidlaw fitted in well with the existing business. One
described the company as 'conservative, well-managed, but not particularly
exciting,' with a share price still reasonably cheap compared with others in
the sector.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Continued progress lifts Epwin to Pounds
1.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EPWIN Group, the maker of PVC-u windows and doors, continued its recent
progress with a 34 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.75m in
the six months to June 30.
The rise from Pounds 1.31m was struck on turnover up 20 per cent at Pounds
24.7m (Pounds 20.5m). With the exception of the commercial sector, which
serves local authorities and the Property Services Agency, volume increases
were gained in all the group's other UK markets.
Mr John Townsend, finance director, said that 'the mix was essential' to the
group's success, which 'tracked back to the Telford extrusion plant' which
has absorbed some two thirds of the Pounds 9.9m capital expenditure
programme instigated in March 1992.
'When the volume comes through, you get a return on capital,' he said.
Mr Jim Rawson, chairman, said that Epwin had expected a poor winter, partly
because of the general economic climate and partly because of the seasonal
nature of the group's business.
So the group mothballed the South Wales factory in December with the loss of
about 100 jobs.
However, the anticipated decline did not materialise in November, December
or subsequently, and the factory was reopened, though with some savings on
the wages front.
Mr Rawson said that the pick-up in the market now stretched to eight months
and that the group had continued to gain market share.
He added that there was 'some level of returning confidence by home owners
and their willingness to invest in property improvement'.
Earnings per share expanded 14 per cent, from 5p to 5.7p, and the interim
dividend is lifted to 2.3p, an increase of 10 per cent on last time's 2.1p.
At the period-end, there were no external borrowings.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: US Smaller Trust asset value soars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the year to June 30 net asset value of US Smaller Companies Investment
Trust rose 17.9 per cent in dollar terms, and 50.3 per cent, from 93.9p to
141.1p, in sterling equivalent.
The trust does not hedge currency exposure; the difference is the result of
the dollar's appreciation of 27.5 per cent against sterling.
The underperformance against the Russell 2500 and the 2-3 Decile Benchmark
emerged largely during the second half, primarily because of the market's
preference for 'value' stocks compared with 'growth' stocks.
Outlook for investment in smaller companies in the US continued to be
favourable.
On the revenue side total income was Pounds 597,000 (Pounds 397,000) and
earnings per share worked through at 0.64p (0.54p). The dividend is again
0.3p, although the previous total included a special 0.2p.

</HEADLINE>

PROFITS before tax of Stonehill Holdings expanded from Pounds 49,000 to
Pounds 264,000 for the year ended March 31. The results reflected the
acquisition of Cathay International United Investments.
With the acquisition the group's activities and operations are focused
predominantly on the People's Republic of China. There are significant
opportunities to expand in China through acquisitions and joint ventures,
and by developing CIU's existing operations at the Landmark Hotel in
Shenzhen.
In the UK the group continued to make progress at the Stonehill Business
Park and with the management contract relating to the Montpelier Business
Park in Ashford.
The furniture division was closed at the end of the year. Turnover from
continuing operations was Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 4.56m) with operating profit
at Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.83m). Net interest charges dropped to Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 1.79m). Earnings per share came to 0.027p (losses 0.042p).
It is planned to reorganise the capital. Preference dividends are in arrears
totalling Pounds 252,000.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw jumps to Pounds 3.7m -
Results from two motor distributors illustrate industry recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVANS HALSHAW, the West Midlands-based motor dealing group, is seeking
significant acquisitions as its trading performance improves sharply.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 3.73m, compared
with Pounds 1.51m, on turnover of Pounds 189.1m (Pounds 169.2m). Earnings
per share were 11.3p (4.6p). The interim dividend goes up to 3.8p (3.6p).
Although the rise in profits was higher than market estimates, it emphasised
a growing trend in the motor dealing sector. Rival groups Lex and Cowie have
both recently announced improved results.
Mr Geoff Dale, chairman, was confident that improved trading would continue.
August, the new registration month, is 'very positive' with group sales 15
per cent higher than the same month of 1992 and the market, he said, 'is
more consistent now, not just in car sales but across the business.' Overall
car sales have been 20 per cent higher than last year.
During recession, the group continued to invest, in, for example, motor
villages where several franchises are grouped together, while, at the same
time, bearing down on costs, helping it move into recovery with a lower cost
base.
Organic growth would continue, Mr Dale promised, 'while we step up our
search for the right major acquisitions.' Potential purchases will be judged
against three criteria.
They will have to fit into the geographical pattern of the group's business;
they will have to hold franchises which fit the existing blend - not being
dependent on any one car maker; and they will be quality businesses with a
local reputation and adequate showroom and technical facilities.
Evans Halshaw is one of the six largest UK motor dealing groups, but is
probably only half the size of Lex, which itself has been expanding with the
purchase of Arlington and Lucas Autocentres. Cowie too has made a recent
acquisition.
With the larger motor trade groups in expansive frame of mind, Mr Dale sees
the industry becoming less fragmented. Given that the car makers also have
substantial interests at the retail end of the market, he opened up the
possibility of the smaller and medium-sized companies being squeezed between
them and the acquisitive larger groups.
The rise in car sales - new model sales will probably finish 10 per cent
higher in 1993 than in 1992 - can have a quick effect on the financial
position of companies in the trade. Servicing and parts sales make up the
base of their business - 74 per cent of Evans Halshaw's mix last year but 62
per cent so far this year as car sales rise. The new and used car trade is
the jam on the bread and butter.
But the jam is not being evenly spread. This is clear from Evans Halshaw's
business which is spread over 42 dealerships and 17 marques.
Dealerships south of the M4 motorway are finding trading the most difficult.
The Ford franchises are doing less well than the Rover, Vauxhall and Peugeot
franchises. With the exception of Jaguar, the luxury end of the car market
remains sluggish.

FT  18 AUG 93 / French purchase lifts Kalon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREATLY helped this time by its recent French acquisition rather than by its
UK side, Kalon, the paints group, maintained the pattern of its growth with
a 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.16m to Pounds 8.73m
in the six months to July 3.
Group operating profits rose to Pounds 8.76m (Pounds 5.93m).
Continuing operations - essentially the UK activities - were ahead 5 per
cent to Pounds 6.3m on turnover of Pounds 56.5m (Pounds 50.5m), while
Novodec, the French private-label paint maker acquired in February for
Pounds 22m, pitched in Pounds 2.46m on turnover of Pounds 19.3m in its five
months in the group.
Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director, said the growth in the UK
decorative paints division had come from additional volumes and that Kalon
had lifted its market share in the UK retail and trade paints sectors,
though margins had fallen.
Prices had come under pressure as a result of the competitive cash-back
incentives from the multinational branded paint makers - ICI and Crown  -
and as competition between the DIY superstores - such as B&amp;Q, Texas and
Do-It-All - hotted up.
Mr Hennessy reckoned that, including the cash-back offers, paint prices fell
18 per cent year-on-year, and otherwise were down as much as 25 per cent.
In response to this and a general recession-driven urge for customers to buy
cheap, Kalon introduced a range of 'budget' products to pick up busin-ess at
lower price points - 'fine-tuning to suit strategy to market conditions',
said Mr Hennessy.
On a six-monthly basis, Novodec had lifted its profits 40 per cent on
turnover up 22 per cent, and that as 'a one-legged animal' in private-label
retail paints.
Soon to come are further legs - the introduction of Leyland trade paints
into the Pounds 500m French trade paints market (the UK's market is Pounds
300m), and the launch of trade centres.
The first will open in Lille at the turn of the year and up to four are
planned by the end of 1994.
The specialist products division, recently formed after Kalon bought Mangers
in November 1992 and Chelec two months later, made Pounds 148,000 on
turnover of Pounds 3m.
Profits in the exports side fell 40 per cent to Pounds 197,000 on Pounds
2.47m turnover, though there should be an improvement in the second half.
The Spanish operations reduced their losses and are expected to break even
over the year.
The interim dividend is lifted 30 per cent to 1.3p, payable from a 29 per
cent rise in earnings per share to 4.46p (3.45p).
COMMENT
Having raced ahead in the past five years or so, UK paints activity, Kalon's
core business, is now slowing down. There has been over-capacity and largely
paints in the UK have been over-priced. With this in mind, the group's
French move seems more impressive now than it did in February and is another
feather in Mr Hennessy's cap. Production efficiencies and lower raw material
costs may just be the tip of the iceberg in the French operation's
medium-term growth potential. If Mr Hennessy and his team can replicate
Kalon's operational formula in France, and the feeling is they can, then Mr
Hennessy will again earn himself an enormous pay packet in his now famous
triennial bonus scheme. Short term, forecasts for the year remain at Pounds
19m pre-tax, giving a multiple of about 17. The premium to the market still
does not fully value the group.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bucknall recovery under way as deficit is
cut to Pounds 1.33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKNALL GROUP, the quantity surveying, property and project management
company, reduced pre-tax losses by 31 per cent in the year to April 30.
Mr Richard Miles, chairman, expects 'a return to profitability in the not
too distant future.'
The pre-tax deficit was Pounds 1.33m, reduced from Pounds 1.92m last time.
Losses per share were 10.5p (13p). No dividend is proposed.
The lower losses and the prospect of a return to profit owe more to cost
reductions than to demand in the construction and property markets where the
group is taking work on margins which, said Mr Miles, 'are hovering around
the break-even.'
Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 16m, fractionally lower than
the year before.
The UK accounts for about 75 per cent of the group's business and domestic
operations came back into profit during the second half.
Bucknall is trading profitably in Germany, Hong Kong and the Middle East;
but cancelled projects forced retrenchment in France and the cost of this
was the main factor dragging on finances last year, just as similar
experiences in the UK pulled down the previous year's figures.
Behind expectations of a return to profitability is the absence of sizeable
restruct-uring costs in the current year.
'We are confident that the worst is over for the group,' Mr Miles said.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Noble Lowndes under Imro investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBLE LOWNDES, the employee benefits agency, is under investigation by the
Investment Management and Regulatory Organisation, according to the
acquisition document circulated by Sedgwick Group yesterday.
It says that last year Noble Lowndes identified possible breaches of Imro
rules on 'suitability and switching' by two of the consultants in its
personal financial services divi-sion.
Imro launched a formal investigation in April this year to examine these
breaches, to study the effectiveness of compliance systems and controls
within the company and to consider the payment of compensation to investors
who may have suffered loss.
Mr Stuart Tarrant, group finance director, said Sedgwick was fully aware of
the investigation, which he expected to take several more months to
complete.
Mr Tarrant said TSB had agreed as part of the sale of Noble Lowndes to
provide an indemnity against any disciplinary proceedings that result.
The acquisition document says Noble Lowndes has already implemented and is
in the process of implementing further significant changes in its systems
and procedures to remedy compliance weaknesses.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins sale discussions may lead to new
directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSKINS Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer, said yesterday that
its board was 'in discussions with a third party which may lead to the
appointment of new directors.'
In view of the development, the company said Mr Richard Holman, a dissident
shareholder, had agreed no further action should be taken for the time being
over his request for an extraordinary meeting.
The discussions are believed to involve the sale of most of the 30 per cent
shareholding in the USM-quoted company of Mr Barrie Hoar, the chairman, and
his family.
Mr Hoar said the family had decided to sell a majority of its stake
'provided we can ensure that new management will be in the best long term
interest of all shareholders.'
He and his brother Robert fought off an attempt by rebel shareholders to
remove them from the board last year and have been facing a further
challenge from Mr Holman.
Mr Adam Page, former chairman of Midsummer Leisure whose plan to reverse
three theme bar businesses into Hoskins collapsed, said he had reached a
verbal agreement to buy the Hoar shareholding. However, he had been informed
the following day that the family was negotiating with another party.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: 'Bloody bizarre' goings on at RTZ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BLOODY BIZARRE stuff, isn't it?' said an RTZ official yesterday after
reading a Reuter report about the organisation which said it might arrange a
bid for the world's biggest mining company.
Mr Raymond Grant, who signed a fax message to RTZ saying a bid was being
organised, told the news agency that his group felt mineral wealth should
not be controlled by corporations.
'All we do is co-ordinate together for peace for development in the
developing world and we believe that mineral wealth is the birthright of
each nation,' he added. 'And we do not believe that the birthright of each
nation should be held within a corporate structure.'
Mr Grant claimed individuals, companies and countries that were members of
his organisation held Pounds 200m-worth of RTZ shares.
The market was not panicked by Mr Grant's revelations and the RTZ share
price ended unchanged at 687p.
Even so, Mr Grant and his friends would have to find at least another Pounds
7bn to buy the group.
RTZ, which has contacts with many environmental and national groups around
the world, said it had no previous knowledge of Mr Grant's organisation.
Instead of rushing to hire a merchant bank to mount a bid defence, RTZ
passed the fax on to the London Stock Exchange.
The Stock Exchange contacted the UK takeover panel as the fax appeared to
breach UK bid regulations.
'We will be investigating,' said an exchange official.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Marbaix merges Asquith and Butler to create
single machine tool maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the oldest UK machine tool builders, Asquith and Butler, are being
merged into one company by their new owner to create a strong force in one
of the most competitive industrial product markets.
Marbaix Lapointe, the machine tool side of Marbaix (Holdings), a
family-owned Basingstoke-based concern, has combined the two companies, both
based in Halifax, to form Asquith Butler.
The Asquith site will close and the entire company will move on to the
nearby Butler site.
The merger is the culmination of a plan by Marbaix to broaden its presence
in the machine tool industry, after buying in 1987 the Lapointe broaching
machine business.
Last year Marbaix Lapointe purchased Asquith, founded in 1866 and best known
for its vertical machining centres.
Asquith had been subject to a management buy-out in 1981.
Then in February it paid a nominal amount to the publicly-quoted B Elliott
engineering group for Butler, which makes horizontal machining centres.
Butler was founded in 1868 and had been combined by B Elliott with Newall,
the Keighley-based blade-tip grinding business, which was excluded from the
sale.
Marbaix was attracted by the strength of the products and the personnel at
Asquith and Butler, but because of the recession both companies were losing
money.
'We have put together two companies that may not have survived on their
own,' said Mr Peter Cain, managing director of Marbaix Lapointe, yesterday.
The merger would produce economies of scale and better utilisation of
factory equipment.
Asquith Butler will have annual sales of Pounds 10m-Pounds 11m and about 120
employees - a large company for the machine tool industry. Mr Cain said
competition, mainly from Spain and France, was serious, but he believed
Asquith Butler would make a profit this year.

FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Drug clearance boosts Glaxo
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO has won US approval for its ondansetron drug to treat patients
suffering from nausea that sometimes follows surgery.
The approval could add more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) a year to the
sales of the drug by 1997. Glaxo shares rose 36 1/2 p to close at 558p
yesterday as the pharmaceutical sector in London caught up with overnight
gains on Wall Street after President Bill Clinton's latest comments on his
health care reform ambitions.
Until now, the drug has been limited in the US to patients with nausea
arising from cancer chemotherapy rather than anaesthetics used in
operations.
Glaxo said it would begin promoting the wider use for ondansetron, sold
under the trade name Zofran, later this year.
It is already approved and available for use in 17 countries for
post-operative nausea. The US is likely to account for at least half total
sales, said Mr Stuart Adkins, pharmaceuticals analyst with Lehman Brothers,
the stockbroker.
The drug is one of Glaxo's most important new products. It is one of a small
group of big sellers likely to take over from Zantac, the ulcer treatment,
as a mainstay of the company's profitability.
Zantac's position as the world's best selling drug is under threat from the
expiry of its patents and a patent law suit in the US.
Launched in March 1990, ondansetron had world sales of Pounds 163m in the
six months to end-December 1992. Although sales are growing quickly, the
drug is facing competition from SmithKline Beecham's Kytril, and Navaban,
from Sandoz of Switzerland.
Post-operative doses are much lower than for post-chemotherapy. A typical
dose of 4mg will cost Dollars 17.29 in the US. Chemotherapy doses are
between 8mg and 32mg and cost proportionally more.

FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: An acquisition with logic - Sedgwick's
purchase of Noble Lowndes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEDGWICK GROUP was quick yesterday to defend its proposed acquisition of
Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy, from TSB Group on both
price and business logic.
At Pounds 110m, the purchase is priced at more than three times the
company's net assets of Pounds 33.9m and nearly 10 times pre-tax profits of
Pounds 11.5m in the year to October 31 1992.
But Mr Stuart Tarrant, Sedgwick's group finance director, preferred to
stress that the acquisition is for less than the company's turnover during
the past year of Pounds 122.5m.
Sedgwick argues that Noble Lowndes is an important part of the benefits
consulting sector with a strong brand image, which fits in neatly with its
own consulting services division. Last year, its own employee benefits
consultancy reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.1m.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive of Sedgwick, said yesterday: 'It has been our
stated strategy to develop our business in two clearly defined areas,
worldwide insurance and reinsurance, and consulting services. We consider
the employee benefits field offers significant potential for long-term
growth.'
He highlighted the scope for increased business from the budgetary pressures
on governments, the changing demographic structure of developed countries
and the reviews of employee benefits instigated by many companies as a
result.
Mr Tarrant also stressed the potential for considerable cross-selling
between Noble Lowndes and Sedgwick's existing clients, particularly in the
middle market.
He was also keen to point out yesterday what he believes is substantial
scope for improved margins, particularly in the US. 'They bought six
different businesses in the US, and I'm not sure the rationalisation is
fully completed,' he said. 'Our view of the US is very positive.'
Noble Lowndes, which was acquired along with Hill Samuel, the merchant bank,
in 1987 did not fit easily into TSB's collection of businesses. Its disposal
marks a further step towards the bank's stated intention of concentrating on
retail banking and insurance for mass market customers.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, the TSB chairman, emphasised yesterday that Noble
Lowndes was a 'discreet' business despite being profit-making. 'It is a
particular type of expertise and a particular culture. It was always
relatively small, and there was no obvious synergy for us,' he said.
TSB has accelerated the rate at which it has disposed of businesses
recently, although Sir Nicholas emphasises that this strategy has been in
place for three years. It agreed to sell Swan National Leasing, its vehicle
contract hire arm to the leasing business of Midland Bank last month.
The bank has a greater managerial than financial incentive to dispose of
businesses. It is already well-capitalised, despite the large losses on
lending through Hill Samuel. Its Tier 1 ratio of capital to risk-weighted
assets stands at 8.1 per cent - well above international standards.
But the bank has made little secret of wanting to divest businesses outside
retail financial services - inclu- ding Hill Samuel - in order to focus its
management on a single type of operation. This would mark a return to TSB's
roots as a retail savings bank before acquisitions in the late-1980s.
The bank has already added Pounds 58m to its Pounds 1.3bn of Tier 1 capital
by selling Swan National Leasing; the Noble Lowndes disposal will increase
that further. Probably as important, the bank has been seen to achieve a
good price despite fairly publicly offering several businesses for sale.
The biggest strategic question for TSB is whether the Noble Lowndes sale is
a precursor to that of Hill Samuel. The bank has been trying to re-focus
Hill Samuel as a merchant bank, concentrating on corporate finance and
advisory services, after removing Pounds 1.6bn of poor debt into a separate
unit.
Sir Nicholas insisted that yesterday's disclosure was 'irrelevant' to Hill
Samuel. But the upturn in acquisition activity which the sale signals can
hardly be bad for TSB's chances of getting an offer for the merchant bank
which satisfies the barrier of returning value to shareholders.

FT  18 AUG 93 / SE Banken launches rights and drops request for aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, has
withdrawn its request for state support after yesterday disclosing plans to
raise SKr5.3bn (Pounds 440m) through the largest rights issue in Swedish
banking history.
'The crisis for the bank is over,' said Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive.
Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, welcomed the bank's decision to
withdraw its application for state support as 'good for taxpayers, good for
SE Banken and good for confidence in the Swedish economy.'
The bank also announced a return to profit in the second quarter and the
first fall in loan losses since it plunged into crisis last year.
The performance was seen as a sign that the worst is behind Sweden's banking
sector, which has been ravaged by huge losses.
SE Banken said it was withdrawing its request for state aid because it no
longer felt in danger of falling through minimum capital adequacy
requirements - a turnround from February when it first applied for help.
In the second quarter the group made SKr310m. This restricted the first-half
loss to SKr298m, SKr2.2bn lower than in the same period of 1992 and much
less than analysts had predicted.
Operating profits before lending losses rose 58 per cent to SKr4.85bn, while
credit losses fell 8 per cent to SKr5.15bn.
Net problem loans fell to SKr22.5bn, or 7.4 per cent of overall lending,
compared with SKr28.8bn, or 7.9 per cent of lending last year.
The bank's capital ratio has risen to 9.1 per cent, compared with 8.4 per
cent on December 31. It is now comfortably above the 8 per cent minimum.
Shares are being offered on a one-for-one basis at a deeply discounted price
of SKr20 per share. Many of the bank's leading shareholders, including the
Wallenberg family which holds 7 per cent, have indicated support.
Yesterday's disclosures sent the bank's shares up a further 11.5 per cent to
SKr78.5, against SKr7 in April.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Days of the one-way currency bet are over: Speculation in
the ERM may be more difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH and German politicians have recently expressed grave concern at the
profits made by currency speculators during the recent crises in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
But, ironically, foreign exchange dealers are themselves beginning to wonder
whether recent events were the last opportunity to make easy profits by
placing big one-way bets on the devaluations of weaker European currencies.
Instead, they think that profits will come more from sophisticated
marketmaking activities now that governments have allowed currencies to
float within very wide bands.
Some players, like Mr George Soros, the head of the Quantum hedge fund in
New York, have made big returns by selling a currency to its central bank as
it approached the ERM floor against the D-Mark and buying it back when it
had devalued.
But, with the new 15 per cent limits, the build-up of investor pressure as a
currency approaches its floor may be less common. 'The phenomenon of central
banks providing the market with a profit as they try to maintain fixed
exchange rates may not be there in future,' says the head of currency
dealing at a top London bank.
Instead, dealers are learning to live with a different market, one in which
European exchange rates move two ways but over bigger distances than they
did when they were straitjacketed in smaller bands. 'A 2 or 3 centime move
in the D-Mark/French franc exchange rate is now a daily phenomenon,' says
one London currency dealer. 'That cross rate might have budged by only a
fraction of that amount until recently.'
The new situation highlights the importance for banks of their intermediary
role as marketmakers, buying a currency from a client and selling it at a
more lucrative price to another. 'It becomes far more important to make
markets in this kind of environment,' says Mr Chris Deuters, head of foreign
exchange at Lehman Bros in London.
Marketmaking may sound less ambitious and exciting than taking aggressive
one-way bets. But, currency managers at the leading commercial banks in
London - at institutions such as Citibank, NatWest Markets or Barclays - say
they have been focusing on this for some time.
This is partly through necessity. Commercial banks' balance sheets were
weakened by the asset price deflation of the 1980s, making managers much
more averse to risk-taking. And, even if they wanted to speculate in
currencies, the Bank for International Settlements' directives restrict the
amount of long-term risk a commercial bank can undertake with its cash
holdings.
But, the returns on marketmaking have also been huge. Citibank, which claims
to be one of the leading interbank counterparties in the London market,
recently reported an increase in revenues from Dollars 377m (Pounds 253m) in
the first half of 1992 to Dollars 592m in the first six months of this year.
Chase Manhattan, another leading interbank dealer in the London market, also
reported increased revenues, up from Dollars 124m in the first six months of
1992 to Dollars 188m in the first half of 1993.
A top official revealed his bank's profits were up 90 per cent on those for
the first half of 1992. 'These are the kinds of figures being reported by
the major banks in the London currency market,' he says.
What is striking about these revenues is that they came in a six-month
period which saw few crises in the ERM. The punt, peseta and escudo were
devalued, but these are comparatively illiquid markets where speculative
profits are limited.
Instead, several new phenomena in the currency market helped transform
two-way pricemaking in currencies into a lucrative activity. The volumes of
currency flowing across the foreign exchanges increased because of the
greater activity of pension funds in international asset allocation.
The International Monetary Fund reported earlier this year that cross-border
equity holdings in the US, Japan and Europe had increased from Dollars 800bn
in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991.
Fund managers invest increasingly large quantities in overseas bond and
equity markets - and they first have to buy foreign currencies from the
commercial banks to purchase these instruments. The banks are living in a
period of increasing turnover in foreign currencies, estimated at a global
Dollars 1,000bn a day.
Once fund managers and multinational companies have bought overseas equities
and bonds, they protect them from volatile exchange rates.
After the exit of sterling from the ERM last year, many banks in London and
New York discovered greater customer interest in their derivatives, which
allow the purchaser to hedge risk.
The increased role of fund managers means that a small group of banks have
the liquidity to handle the huge flows in foreign exchange, so currency
business is becoming concentrated in the hands of the top 10 or 12
commercial banks in the London market. 'We are picking up the business of
people we had never heard of two or three years ago,' says Mr Albert
Maasland, head of sales at Chase Manhattan Bank in London.
Commercial bank dealers may have reasons to feel unsure about the future of
the business. The prospect of capital controls has recently been mooted by
French and Belgian politicians as a means of containing large-scale capital
moves.
Implementation of those controls would dry up the fluctuation in European
exchange rates. So, too, would any fast track move to European Monetary
Union. Both moves would be difficult for governments to take because of the
difficulty they have already experienced co-ordinating their monetary
policies.
But for the moment, currency managers can profit from daily exchange rate
movements, whether they are in the thick of a speculative crisis or not.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Tiphook finance director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RODGER Braidwood has resigned as finance director of Tiphook, the
container leasing and transport rental group which last month revealed
pre-tax losses of Pounds 21.8m for the year to April.
He is to receive compensation totalling less than one year's salary, which
was more than Pounds 500,000 according to the 1992 annual report, although
he had a three-year contract.
Tiphook shares fell 2p to 242p.
The company blamed last year's loss on a Pounds 77.3m charge following
changes in accounting policies. The charge covered, among other things,
foreign exchange hedging losses, losses on interest rate swaps and costs
related to redemption of preference shares.
Tiphook said yesterday that Mr Braidwood's departure was 'amicable'. He is
abroad on holiday. His replacement is Mr Andrew Chandler, 36, the financial
controller who joined the group in 1990. Tiphook conceded that Mr Chandler
was not well known to shareholders, but said its banks knew him well.
Tiphook also confirmed that Mr Rupert Hambro, a non-executive director,
would become a non-executive deputy chairman, and that he would chair the
audit and remuneration committees. A review of salaries and incentive
payments to directors was in hand, and directors' salaries would be cut this
year. More non-executive directors from outside the UK would be recruited
'in due course'.
The group said it was committed to 'stronger financial controls' and that it
had 'adequate funding for its current needs'. There has been speculation
that its burden of Pounds 1bn debt could lead to an equity issue.
One lender to the group said the announcement of board changes was 'an
appropriate step'. He said that it could be hard to achieve the right
balance between entrepreneurial flair and strong business management in a
company like Tiphook.

FT  18 AUG 93 / US miners contribute to 16% fall at Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 16 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 905m to Pounds 763m, for the nine months to
June 30.
Last year's figure was, however, boosted by Pounds 129m of exceptional gains
from the sales of British Ever Ready and a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial
Chemical Industries. This time there was only a Pounds 10m asset write-down.
Profit before exceptionals fell from Pounds 764m to Pounds 733m on sales of
Pounds 7bn (Pounds 6.1bn). Fully diluted earnings per share, reflecting the
return to a regular tax charge, slid to 11.5p from 15.7p. The shares shed 3p
to 252 1/2 p.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the group was on target to complete
its Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) acquisition of Quantum Chemical Corporation
of the US by the end of September.
Its full-year results are expected to show that absorbing Quantum's Dollars
2.5bn borrowings has pushed gearing to more than 80 per cent. The group
expects the acquisition to make a positive contribution to earnings in
1993-94. Analysts believe the rise in debt will lead to sales of smaller
businesses.
The US miners' strike had affected 19 mines owned by Hanson's Peabody
subsidiary - accounting for half of the company's capacity. Peabody's
profits for the nine months, including a first Australian contribution, fell
32 per cent to Pounds 73m.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, said the
United Mine Workers of America had agreed to resume negotiations with the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association in Washington DC.
Hanson benefited from the strength of the dollar against sterling. It was
Dollars 1.4935 at the end of June compared with Dollars 1.8920 in the
previous year. This is understood to have almost made up the shortfall in
profits from the Peabody strike. More than half of the group's profits are
generated by Hanson Industries.
The results include nine months' contribution from Beazer, the building and
aggregates company bought in late 1991.
In the three months to June 30, Hanson's profits before exceptionals fell
from Pounds 276m to Pounds 266m. Earnings per share were 3.8p (7.2p) and the
quarterly dividend is 2.85p.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Sedgwick raises Pounds 144m to fund deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEDGWICK, one of the UK's biggest insurance brokers, yesterday launched a
Pounds 143.7m rights issue to fund two acquisitions.
The main target is Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy, which
it has agreed to buy from TSB Group for Pounds 110m.
Funding will come from a one-for-five rights issue of 90.7m shares at 165p
each. The company's shares closed down 15p yesterday at 191p.
The announcement came as the group unveiled pre-tax profits up 4 per cent to
Pounds 54.1m in the six months to June 30.
The group has also agreed in principle to buy Arvid Bergvall, a Scandinavian
marine insurance broker, for a maximum of NKr196m (Pounds 17.8m).
Up to 90 per cent of the purchase will be satisfied in cash, with the rest
in Sedgwick shares.
Noble Lowndes, which is based in the UK, employs 2,750 staff in 44 locations
around the world. Its services include pensions advice, employee benefits
and personal financial services consulting. Pre-tax profits were Pounds
11.5m in the year to October 31 1992.
Mr Tarrant said all Noble Lowndes' senior management would be transferred
except Mr Carl Daniels, the chairman and chief executive, who was retiring.
The managing director's role was being split into two, for Europe and the
rest of the world.
Transamerica International, which owns 24.1 per cent of Sedgwick, supported
the rights issue and will partially subscribe, reducing its stake to 21 per
cent.
The closing date for acceptances is September 7. The issue is fully
underwritten by NM Rothschild and SG Warburg.
Sedgwick's interim turnover rose to Pounds 379.6m from Pounds 323.3m.
Earnings per share increased by 0.1p to 7.5p and the dividend remained
unchanged at 3p.
Pre-tax profits from insurance and reinsurance rose to Pounds 55.7m (Pounds
55.3m) and from employee benefits consulting to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.3m).
Profits from insurance underwriting fell to Pounds 0.3m (Pounds 0.7m) and
the Lloyd's underwriting business made a loss of Pounds 0.4m (loss of Pounds
0.7m).
'It's a mixed bag,' said Mr Stuart Tarrant, group finance director.
'Reinsurance has been extremely difficult. We are happy with the premiums
but there is just not the capacity around.'
Exchange rate movements contributed Pounds 11.1m to pre-tax profits during
the period. Interest and investment income fell to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds
26.3m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by Hanson's legendary standards of opacity, its third-quarter results
are particularly murky as it finalises the acquisition of Quantum. What
little can be gleaned suggests the Peabody strike is now inflicting real
pain while the UK and US recoveries are proving largely joyless. The market,
though, seems prepared to look through the dull outlook for this year and
next towards the sunnier uplands that may lie beyond. If Hanson's early
cycle businesses are sparking by then and its late cycle activities can take
up the slack, Hanson could again produce faster earnings growth than the
market.

FT  18 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: SE Banken
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloom surrounding Nordic banking is lifting as quickly as it descended,
judging by SE Banken's first-half results. It is a measure of the renewed
confidence that Sweden's biggest commercial bank is launching a SKr5.3bn
rights issue and has withdrawn its request for state support after just nine
months. The 11-fold rise in SE Banken's shares since April now looks to have
firmer foundations.
The rights issue will significantly bolster SE Banken's balance sheet and
move it away from the danger zone: its problem loans threatened to push the
bank below international capital adequacy standards. At an operating level,
it is showing a marked improvement in earnings. Sweden's lowest interest
rates since the 1970s have certainly helped, but SE Banken has also made
useful gains in securities and foreign exchange. Costs are now 2.5 per cent
lower than a year ago, although the full extent of the rationalisation is
masked by the krona's devaluation. Still, it would be dangerous to get swept
away. SE Banken's problem loans are horrific and credit losses may amount to
as much as SKr11bn this year. And while banks across the world have found it
easy to justify wider margins while recession lingers, the trick will be to
maintain them when recovery takes hold.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sedgwick's last rights issue in 1986 marked a turning point for all the
wrong reasons. Group revenue has since risen by 26 per cent, but expenses by
more than 40 per cent. That is reflected in an unrelenting squeeze on
margins, first as insurance rates softened in the late 1980s and latterly as
underwriting losses have eroded capacity in the London market. No surprise,
then, that yesterday's rights price is little more than half that offered
seven years ago.
The acquisition of Noble Lowndes from TSB looks better timed than the move
into US brokerage at the top of the cycle in 1986. Whether Sedgwick will be
able to create a one-stop shop for insurance broking and benefits
consultancy remains open to question. But even without cross-selling between
the two sides of the business, demand for consulting should pick up as the
economy turns. A purchase price of around 14 times last year's earnings,
once the impact of TSB's pension fund holiday on Noble Lowndes' profits is
stripped out, does not look over the odds.
Since 75 per cent of Sedgwick's revenue will come from insurance broking
after the acquisition, though, its fortunes are still tied to the insurance
cycle. Waiting for US rates to harden has so far proved thankless. Halting
the steady shrinkage of London market capacity depends on Lloyd's success in
attracting corporate capital. The golden scenario for Sedgwick - in which US
rates harden as the capacity of the London market increases - looks unlikely
indeed.

FT  18 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Laughing Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the Monopolies and Mergers Commission reports appear to give British
Gas a framework for the next decade, the company can not act on it yet. The
Department of Trade and Industry is clearly in favour of early competition,
but the MMC proposals would delay a free-for-all in the domestic market
beyond 2000. That alone is enough to cast doubt on whether the
recommendations will be accepted. The limbo for British Gas shareholders
will thus last a few months longer - hence yesterday's cautious share price
response.
Still, working on the assumption that the DTI votes in favour of the
changes, shareholders have several reasons to be pleased. Overall, the
essence of the MMC's conclusions is that if a more competitive market
structure is to be introduced, customers, rather than British Gas's
shareholders, should bear the cost. In the absence of a genuine competition,
the MMC panel would seem to have awarded British Gas an away win.
In the central recommendation on divestment of its trading activities,
British Gas has been left with a viable business which it can sell or
demerge, and which faces only limited further competition in the next few
years. It could easily have been required to lose market share without
compensation. The company is also being allowed to pass on the costs of
restructuring its business to customers. The price cap on the total business
has also been eased, bringing in an additional Pounds 300m of profits over
three years to make up for last year's reduction of the tariff threshold.
When the transport and trading businesses are finally separated, British Gas
will be able to charge the demerged trading company at the rate currently
charged to third parties. Its pipeline business will then be making profits
of at least Pounds 800m a year. With the higher rate of return on new
assets, British Gas's overall rate of return will climb as it invests in new
pipes, as will its profits as the capital employed in the business grows.
The delay in competition will also increase value for Gas's shareholders -
either by boosting the price of the trading arm if it is sold, or protecting
its profits if it is demerged.
All of which leaves British Gas in a better position than it was last
August, albeit somewhat short of the peaches and cream paradise the company
was seeking. The dividend looks secure, though given that finances will
remain tight, and the company is some distance short of its target of a
twice-covered payout, any dividend increases are likely to be slow. That
said, the 45 per cent yield premium to the market looks too high, even
though other utilities have higher dividend cover. All the more so since
many of them are just about to go through the regulatory mill.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Merseyside postal workers mobilise for strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S postal service faces the possibility of further disruption in
spite of yesterday's settlement of a two-week dispute by Royal Mail staff in
Cardiff.
A strike ballot of 1,100 postal workers on Merseyside is being prepared to
protest against a threat by local management to reduce full-time delivery
jobs as part of a plan to cut costs by 5 per cent.
The Union of Communication Workers fears the loss of a quarter of the
full-time jobs at Merseyside's 32 postal delivery offices if the Royal Mail
introduces part-time staff to make second deliveries.
The ballot is the latest sign of unrest among staff as the Royal Mail
presses ahead with its quality of service scheme designed to increase
efficiency in the face of rising competition.
In Cardiff, in a ballot organised by the UCW, the staff voted by 556 to 154
to end their industrial action. More than 1m letters were held up by the
strike and the Royal Mail warned it may take a week to clear the backlog.
The Royal Mail said last night it was 'premature' to discuss the plan for
Merseyside, although consultations were going on with the UCW. However, Mr
John Ireland, a local UCW official, warned: 'If talks fail we will go for a
strike ballot.'
An internal Royal Mail management document obtained by the union reveals
details of the Liverpool 'delivery plan' which are to be discussed in staff
briefings this month for implementation in September.
The document says Liverpool has low levels of productivity and jobs can be
safeguarded only by raising productivity.
The plan aims to align working hours and the number of workers more closely
and calls for early starts to ensure the maximum amount of mail is delivered
on time on first delivery.
At present, it says, 85 per cent of the postal traffic is available for
first delivery and this workload is handled by 60 per cent of the delivery
hours. The remaining 15 per cent of the workload is taken out on a second
delivery that uses 40 per cent of the working hours available.

FT  18 AUG 93 / China imposes freeze on pay in state enterprises: Austerity
drive targets loss-making public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has imposed a wage freeze on employees of bloated state enterprises as
part of its austerity drive to regain control of a runaway economy.
The authorities have also warned that state enterprises which make no effort
to pay off their debts - a widespread problem - would gradually lose their
subsidies.
Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, called
yesterday for an accelerated programme of economic reform to deal with the
country's overheating economy. 'We should carry out the rectification by
means of reform, accelerate the reform on the basis of rectification and
lose no time in promoting reform,' he told a meeting of Chinese bankers.
The latest measures to curb waste in the loss-making and overmanned state
sector indicate that China may at last be preparing to tackle one of its
biggest economic challenges.
But problems in this area are so deep-rooted that even if a determined start
is made now, it will take the authorities years to bring the situation under
control.
An official in China's labour ministry was quoted yesterday in the
English-language China Daily as saying that the payment of wages, bonuses,
allowances, subsidies and commissions had 'run out of control'.
Urban employees' wages have risen by 21.7 per cent in the first six months
of this year, compared with the same period last year. State-owned industry
paid out Yn41.29bn (Pounds 4.87bn) in bonuses, during the first six months
of this year, 38 per cent more than the same period in 1992.
China's economy grew by 13.9 per cent in the six months to June. The cost of
living rocketed by more than 17 per cent in the same period, panicking the
leadership into a severe programme of retrenchment, including a credit
squeeze and a crackdown on speculative real estate development.
Western economists in Beijing estimate that more than 50 per cent of China's
state enterprises are losing money. Total annual losses are estimated at
around Yn100bn. There are more than 10,000 small, medium and large state
enterprises.
Mr Rongji who was appointed to head the People's Bank, China's central bank,
last month, is responsible for a wide-ranging economic stabilisation
programme that aims to bring inflation down below 10 per cent within the
next six to 12 months.
The programme's other objectives include restraining money supply growth,
curbing investment in fixed assets and combating rampant speculation in real
estate and commodities.

Motors' German subsidiary, apparently aiming to defuse the conflict.
His intervention is a clear indication of concern at the highest levels of
the German government over the damage done to the country's international
reputation by the row over the alleged theft of industrial secrets.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as Mr Rexrodt himself, has already publicly
urged the two sides to settle their differ-ences.
Mr Rexrodt invited Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, for talks at the
economics ministry in Bonn last night and he has agreed on a similar meeting
with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, to be held on Friday. Both
companies have agreed to the discussions.
A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt was not seeking to mediate directly
in the dispute, in which GM has accused VW of industrial espionage and the
theft of confidential documents.
'He is merely seeking to inform himself about the situation, and about the
arguments on both sides,' she said. 'He is very concerned about the
situation.'
The move was immediately welcomed by VW as a step towards peace talks
between the two companies. They have been at loggerheads since Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing director for GM,
defected to VW in March. GM accused Mr Lopez and several associates of
systematically plundering industrial secrets before their departure.
There was less enthusiasm from senior officials at Opel, who insist that
before the two companies can sit down together Mr Piech must withdraw what
Opel sees as anti-American accusations against GM, and his suggestion that
the US company was somehow responsible for planting its secret documents on
VW employees.
In a furious outburst last month, Mr Piech suggested GM was trying to damage
VW in a commercially motivated war. This week he underscored his commitment
to his production director, repeating that he would 'put my hand in the
fire' for Mr Lopez.
Opel officials added yesterday that the company would not enter peace talks
while the German legal authorities were in the middle of an investigation
into allegations of theft, industrial espionage and fraud.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Merseyside postal workers to vote on part-time plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER disruption is threatening Britain's postal services in spite of
yesterday's settlement of the two-week dispute by Royal Mail staff in
Cardiff.
A strike ballot of 1,100 postal workers on Merseyside is being prepared in
protest at a threat by local management to reduce full-time delivery jobs as
part of a plan to cut costs by 5 per cent.
The Union of Communication Workers fears the loss of a quarter of the
full-time jobs at Merseyside's 32 postal delivery offices if the Royal Mail
introduces part-time staff to make second deliveries.
The ballot is the latest sign of unrest among staff as the Royal Mail
presses ahead with its quality of service scheme designed to increase
efficiency in the face of rising competition.
In Cardiff, in an individual ballot organised by the UCW, the staff voted by
556 to 154 to end their industrial action. More than 1m letters were held up
by the strike and the Royal Mail warned it may take a week to return the
postal services to normal.
The Royal Mail said last night it was 'premature' to discuss the plan for
Merseyside, although consultations were going on with the UCW. However, Mr
John Ireland, a local UCW official warned: 'If talks fail we will go for a
strike ballot.'
An internal Royal Mail management document obtained by the union reveals
details of the Liverpool 'delivery plan' which are to be discussed in staff
briefings this month for implementation in September. 'At the moment the
union are trying to block proposals,' it complains and calls for
'verbal/face-to-face communication' with the staff.
The document warns jobs can be safeguarded only by raising productivity in
deliveries. It points out: 'It is an established fact that our competitors
such as Securicor, UNT, DHL and other private operators have found ways
round our legal monopoly.'
'This competition has grown by 50 per cent in the last two years and this in
a time of recession,' says the document. 'It is estimated that we presently
have 95 per cent of the letter delivery market but if competition continues
to grow at the present rate this share will fall to 60 per cent in the next
five years.' It adds: 'For these reasons we have been targeted to make
productivity savings.'
The paper goes on: 'In addition Liverpool has low levels of productivity
when compared with other areas. Therefore changes must and will happen and
staff owe it to themselves to at least listen to what is being proposed.'
The Royal Mail plan aims to align working hours and the number of workers
more closely to the workload on Merseyside.
At present, it says, 85 per cent of the postal traffic is available for
first delivery and this workload is handled by 60 per cent of the delivery
hours. The remaining 15 per cent of the workload is taken out on a second
delivery that uses 40 per cent of the working hours available.
'Clearly the areas for productivity gains are on second delivery,' the
document says. It calls for early starts to ensure the maximum amount of
mail is delivered on time on first delivery.

Entering the Pearly Gates, Mrs Jones is anxious to enlist St Peter's help in
finding her late husband. On being told his name is Dai Jones, the saint
sighs. 'We have hundreds by that name,' says he, could she perhaps be a bit
more precise? Was he, for instance, Jones the Post or Jones the Grocer? Mrs
Jones was unable to oblige. 'Funnily enough he never had a nickname.'
'Well,' said St Peter, patiently, 'can you give me any other sort of
detail?'
After a little thought, Mrs Jones related how her husband had always said he
would turn in his grave were she to be unfaithful to him when he was gone.
'Aha,' cried St Peter. 'That must be Revolving Jones.'

US ambassadors to Mexico are in the habit of stirring things up, but has Jim
Jones, who is stepping down as chairman of the American Stock Exchange to
take up the top diplomatic post in Mexico, set a record?
Even before he had set foot in the country, Jones was heard agreeing to
check figures on drug hauls as well as to broach the ticklish question of
electoral fraud. That may have satisfied his interlocutor during
confirmation hearings, right-wing republican senator Jesse Helms, but the
nationalist Mexican press immediately branded Jones an interventionist
would-be proconsul. Even the normally sedate Excelsior newspaper urged his
replacement.
Jones, a former democrat congressman from Oklahoma, complains that he merely
said yes to Helms's leading questions and was misunderstood. Still, if he is
to avoid the fate of John Gavin, the former movie star appointed Mexican
ambassador in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, he had better smarten up his act.
Gavin's willingness to break all the rules of diplomacy went down well with
the likes of Helms, but his period in office coincided with a low point in
relations between the US and its important neighbour. Gavin so incensed the
locals that the Mexican press suggested that Cantinflas, the comedian who
made his name in Around the World in 80 Days, should be sent as Mexico's
ambassador to Washington.

Tiphook's finance director, Rodger Braidwood, walked the plank yesterday - a
move thoroughly well-leaked, as has become the wont of the appropriately
named company.
Nothing surprising in that, given the catalogue of recent financial
disasters. But why did he not go at prelims time in July - surely something
else has not gone wrong? And why is he being replaced by his deputy, Andrew
Chandler, who has been there since 1990 and so is no new broom.
The answer is probably that Tiphook, shuddering under gearing levels of 470
per cent, could scarcely allow itself the luxury of a lengthy executive
search, even if it thought it could lure the right person. And Chandler is
by all accounts a slightly more down-to-earth character than his flamboyant
predecessor.
Quite enough entrepreneurial flair is resident in chairman Robert Montague.

Over the years John Selwyn Gummer, Britain's environment minister, has been
called everything, from a crystallised choirboy and solemn-visaged pipsqueak
to a born head prefect. But until now no one has ever dared to call him a
'drittsekk', in public at least.
However, Norwegian environment minister Thorbjoern Berntsen has no such
hang-ups. Berntsen, 58, who used to be a ship's plumber before he took up
Gummer's trade, was addressing a pre-election rally when he uttered one of
Norway's more common swear words, which apparently translates into something
very vulgar, to describe his opposite number in England.
The Norwegians are particularly upset by British emissions of poisonous
gases which fall as acid rain in Norway, killing forests and polluting
lakes. But there is more to it than that. Berntsen, not known for his
environmental sensitivities until he got his job, obviously does not like
Gummer. But unlike his counterpart Labour MPs in Britain, he is not afraid
of saying so.
Yesterday Berntsen admitted that he could probably have said the same using
somewhat different words, but 'I usually say things directly so that people
understand what I mean'. And whereas lesser political figures might have
toned down their comments yesterday, the minister was showing no signs of
being cowed by the rising diplomatic storm. He told the state radio station
that Gummer was one of 'the most arrogant people' he had ever met.
The British embassy in Oslo said it was regrettable for ministers to use
such language, but it seemed that 'Mr Berntsen has been expressing himself
in his usual forthright way'.
Bet John Gummer won't stoop to calling Berntsen a whale-murderer.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Balancing act in the pipeline: Disruption would accompany
the break-up of British Gas. Is it politically acceptable?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, UK secretary of state for trade and industry, has had
plenty of holiday reading heaped on him by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. But while yesterday's 2,000-page report contains a clear set of
recommendations on how to deal with the monopoly of British Gas, he now has
to judge whether they are politically acceptable.
In this, he will have to weigh the government's deep-seated commitment to
greater competition against the disruption that is bound to accompany the
largest company break-up seen in the UK. There will be implications for
domestic gas prices - always a highly sensitive subject - and for the wider
energy balance where the future of coal is already at stake.
Above all, he and his ministerial colleagues are keen for a solution that
brings to an end the bitter squabbling between British Gas and its
regulator, Ofgas, which has overshadowed the company since privatisation in
1986, and which triggered the monopoly inquiry in the first place.
The clarity of the commission's report is both its strength and weakness. It
is forthright about the anti-competitive effect of British Gas's dominance
of all segments of the gas market, and about the remedies that are needed:
British Gas must be made to sell off its supply business, and barriers must
be lowered to allow more competitors to enter the market to supply
households and other small consumers.
Mr Graeme Odgers, commission chairman, said the present structure of British
Gas's business 'is unable to provide the necessary conditions for
self-sustaining competition'.
The report is also a carefully crafted document. It sets out a timetable of
events extending over nine years in a logical progression, leading from
today's highly regulated environment to one in the year 2002 where the gas
market is totally free. But some events are also designed as counterweights
to others to keep disruption to a minimum. Thus, British Gas is allowed
various price benefits to compensate it for the dismantling of its monopoly.
However the commission's craftsmanship also makes it harder for Mr Heseltine
to play around with the recommendations. If he only wants to accept part of
them, or tries to change them, the whole package risks falling apart, rather
like a Chinese puzzle.
Will he, for example, accept the most dramatic recommendation: that British
Gas be made to divest itself of its trading activities by 1997? This goes
much further than most observers had been expecting because of the huge
costs and practical difficulties in dismembering an industry of this size.
It even exceeds the demands contained in a special report prepared by a
number of British Gas's would-be competitors and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. They
called for the separation of British Gas's activities into subsidiaries
rather than a complete break-up.
Logic, insofar as it is any guide, suggests that Mr Heseltine will agree to
a break-up. The government is keen to stimulate competition. It has also
been bombarded with criticism for transforming a string of utilities - from
British Telecom to the electricity generators - into something approaching
private sector monopolies. The monopolies commission gives it the
opportunity to correct the problem in one sector.
Mr Heseltine could still opt for the lesser course proposed by the Coopers
report. But the commission is emphatic that this would not achieve the
desired objective of creating true competition. It also asserts that the
cost of break-up - Pounds 80m annually - is less than British Gas has been
warning of, and would in any case be offset by lower prices as a result of
increased competition.
He also faces some tricky issues in the abolition of British Gas's monopoly
of the tariff market for small consumers. Although the way forward should be
clear to a free-market government, opening up any utility market to
competition is fraught with problems.
Under the present arrangements, a minority of British Gas's customers - the
top third - pays more for its gas and subsidises the majority. This pricing
structure would be swept away by competition, meaning, as the commission
tactfully puts it, there would be 'winners and losers'. The 'postalised
system', which currently ensures that all consumers pay the same no matter
how much it costs to transport the gas to them, would also be sacrificed, so
remote consumers would pay more.
There are also technical and social problems in deregulating gas: who would
be responsible for ensuring that the system operated safely, and who would
supply the disadvantaged segments of the population? If the commission
report has a weakness, it lies in its failure to address these difficulties.
'These are matters for the regulator,' Mr Odgers said yesterday.
It would be easier for Mr Heseltine to deal with the commission's proposals
if the government was not already embroiled in controversy over the
imposition of value-added tax on home heating, and the long-running row over
the run-down of the coal industry. Both these issues have shown that there
are few better ways that the government can stir public ire than by
interfering with the energy industry. It was already clear yesterday that
the Labour party is ready to pounce on any move which suggests that little
old ladies might be left shivering in the cold.
There is one way Mr Heseltine could modify the recommendations to make the
package as a whole more politically acceptable. The commission took the view
that the costs of the restructuring should be loaded on to the consumer
rather than British Gas's shareholders. This was because it believed that
the company's profitability should be enhanced to enable it to attract
investment - and presumably win British Gas's support for the package and
help it fatten up the trading business for divestment. Mr Heseltine could
redirect a portion of these costs on to British Gas itself, which would have
the double advantage of keeping prices down for the consumer and ensuring
that costs were being shared.
Apart from the consumers and shareholders, a third constituency that needs
to be catered for is the group of potential competitors. Unless the
arrangements are sufficiently attractive, they will not participate and the
whole exercise will fail.
With its forthright emphasis on opening up the market, the report went down
well with this group yesterday. Mr Edward Trafford, marketing director of
Mobil, one of the largest suppliers of gas from the North Sea, commended the
commission for 'good thinking' in the recommendations. 'They put British Gas
on a level playing field. The timetable might be a bit faster but at least
they've shown us the horizon we're heading for.'
For British Gas itself, the report marks the beginning of a period of deep
uncertainty, both over Mr Heseltine's intentions and, assuming he accepts
most of its recommendations, the future of the gas business as it settles
into its new shape. The hazard it faces is that Mr Heseltine will take the
politically easier route of accepting only those parts of the report that
profit the consumer without giving British Gas the countervailing benefits.
However, it seems unlikely that Mr Heseltine can afford to be too selective
as he pores over the recommendations. The question of whether more
competition needs to be injected into the gas market is hardly at issue any
more. The report has identified the two main defects of the gas business:
the conflict of interest inherent in British Gas's control of all aspects of
gas supply and transportation, and the effect of the lack of competition on
prices and service standards.
The question has now moved on to how best to deal with these defects. The
Department of Trade and Industry was being studiously uncommunicative
yesterday about its views on the report. But ministers have already
indicated that they want a 'manageable' solution to the British Gas problem.
By this they mean an outcome that satisfies most of the concerns of most of
the interested parties. That is no small task. But the commission's report
has clarified many of the issues in this most complex of monopolies, and
pointed to the possible answers.
