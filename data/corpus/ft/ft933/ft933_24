FT  18 AUG 93 / A lull in creative tension: The outlook for the regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at the Office of Gas Supply were congratulating themselves
yesterday on the outcome of the report by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. 'On a scale of one to 10, I think we've scored nine out of 10,'
said Mr Greg McGregor, director of competition and tariffs.
The commission has embraced many of Ofgas's suggestions for the future of
the gas industry, with some important modifications. It has also vindicated
the view of Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, that his combative style of
regulation has achieved significant benefits for consumers.
Ofgas had called for the radical break-up of British Gas into separate
regional companies as a way of achieving full competition. But officials
stressed yesterday that this was a way of promoting discussion rather than
Sir James's favoured route. Ofgas's main concern was the separation of the
pipelines company from British Gas's trading activities, as the commission
recommended.
Mr Graeme Odgers, chairman of the commission, said he believed the
regulatory system was fundamentally sound, though 'there have been problems
with rather confrontational relationships'. But, in future, the closer
concentration of Ofgas on the technical aspects of the pipelines company
should reduce the element of acrimony.
The retirement of Sir James in October and of Mr Robert Evans, chairman of
British Gas, next year, will help to smooth tensions between the company and
its regulator. Sir James's Glaswegian charm has made little impact on the
taciturn Mr Evans, and they have failed to strike up a cordial working
relationship.
Sir James describes his relations with British Gas as 'creative tension',
but the tension has often been more evident than the creativity. Sir James
has implied that British Gas's top management is not up to the job of taking
the company into a new competitive marketplace. British Gas has countered
with implications that the regulator is 'off his rocker'.
'It is very important to say that the regulatory system has been given a
clean bill of health by the commission. British Gas had been pouring a huge
amount of scorn on us,' said Mr McGregor.
Ofgas welcomes the chance to develop a relationship with a separate
pipelines company - which is what will be left of British Gas when its
trading activities have been divested after March 1997. Mr McGregor said he
relished the idea of working with the company to set up a regulatory regime,
rather than working against it as now.
Sir James's attempts to agree pricing and structural reforms with British
Gas have been fraught, and he has often turned to the media to promote his
views. British Gas has sometimes been caught on the hop, as when Sir James
called on the company to cut its prices to household customers in an
early-morning radio programme last year.
'With the changes at the top of Ofgas and British Gas, I think it provides
an opportunity for a constructive relationship to be built,' said Mr Cedric
Brown, chief executive at British Gas.
But already hints of future tension have slipped into the more co-operative
noises emanating from both the company and the regulator. Ofgas wants to see
competition introduced for household customers more quickly than the
commission has proposed. It believes that many of British Gas's fears of
price rises for small users, and other penalties of a freer market, are
'alarmist'.
In addition, the regulator is unhappy about suggestions by the commission
that the consumer should foot the bill for the costs incurred in selling off
British Gas's trading arm. Ofgas is prepared to push hard for shareholders
to bear this burden, since it is they who have benefited from monopoly
prices - higher than if the market were competitive - since privatisation.
The commission has also trustingly left the details for the introduction of
competition into household supply open to negotiation between Ofgas and
British Gas. This is an area that could prove contentious since views differ
greatly. Sir James's successor will need patience and tolerance if he or she
is to remain in harmonious relations with British Gas.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Nigeria's choices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR TIMES, President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military leader, has
postponed a handover to civilian rule. Yesterday he continued to vacillate,
saying that he had told his army colleagues he was prepared to resign, but
giving no indication of actually doing so. Meanwhile his speech failed to
provide details of the interim government he promised Nigerians when
aborting the presidential poll last June.
The sooner the general goes the better, and international and domestic
pressure must make him choose one of two options. In theory, the most
honourable would be to respect the result of the June election. Unofficial
results gave clear victory to Chief Moshood Abiola. Flawed though the
process was, it offered one way back to civilian rule. If the general cannot
accept that, he has another escape route. His offer of an interim government
could win support, if he retired leaving effective power in the hands of a
new civilian adminstration.
Western governments can play some part in forcing him to choose. They can
warn that in addition to existing ban on visas for military officers, an
arms embargo will be imposed, arms contracts suspended, and heads of
diplomatic missions withdrawn.
This is not enough to budge General Babangida from his bunker. First and
foremost the solution lies within Nigeria. The trouble is there is a growing
danger that the campaign to oust the general will become less a struggle for
civilian rule than a battle between the predominantly Moslem north and the
mainly Christian south.
The divide was starkly illustrated by last week's stayaway called to protest
against military rule. It was massively supported in south-west Nigeria, the
Yoruba-speaking stronghold of Mr Abiola, but won little backing in the
north.
Whatever strategy Nigeria's opposition chooses to pursue, it is vital that
it transcends this dangerous political fault-line. If this crisis cannot
forge a coalition that overcomes ethnic, religious or other rivalries,
Nigeria's prospects are bleak.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Leading Article: The MMC and British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S Monopolies and Mergers Commission's reports on the UK gas market
are in some ways more radical and in some ways less radical than expected.
The commission has been more radical in recommending a break-up of British
Gas, but less radical in proposing that the company's domestic monopoly not
be abolished until early next century.
The overall thrust of the two reports, which aim at a more competitive gas
market, seems about right. Although British Gas has certainly improved value
for money and customer service since privatisation in 1986, much remains to
be done. The company is still overstaffed, while its monopolistic culture
remains strong. Greater competition will not only give British Gas an
incentive to become more efficient, but also give customers a choice.
Nevertheless, some of the commission's detailed recommendations are open to
question. First, the proposed timescale for abolishing British Gas's
monopoly seems too leisurely. The company currently has a lock on all
customers using less than 2,500 therms a year. The commission thinks this
figure should be reduced to 1,500 therms in 1997 with further liberalisation
postponed for another three to five years.
The reason for the delay is that the commission has been persuaded by
British Gas's argument that a free-for-all could cause problems in balancing
supply and demand through the pipeline system. This, it argues, would not
only inconvenience customers but could lead to gas explosions.
Safety argument
While this safety argument cannot be ignored, a solution could surely be
found in less than seven to nine years. The modest reduction in the monopoly
proposed for 1997 will bring the benefits of competition, currently enjoyed
by business customers, to only 500,000 of British Gas's 18m domestic
customers. Customers, who can already choose their telephone company and who
by 1998 will be able to pick their electricity supplier, will wonder why
they are denied choice in gas.
Second, the form of break-up advocated by the commission may not be ideal.
It wants British Gas's trading arm - responsible for selling gas to
customers - to be split from the rest of the business to ensure fair
treatment for rival trading companies which have to send their gas through
the company's pipelines. The commission argues that a complete separation
was necessary. The less radical option of putting Chinese Walls between the
pipeline and trading businesses would, it believes, still allow British Gas
to show favouritism to its in-house trading company. And although break-up
would have its costs, they would be outweighed by the benefits.
Break-up costs
Nevertheless, if the one-off costs of break-up are to be incurred, a
preferable option may be for the pipeline business rather than the trading
arm to be divested. This would ensure fair access to the pipelines not only
for rival trading companies but also rival North Sea gas producers. The
commission seems to have rejected this approach on the flimsy grounds that
British Gas needs to be a large integrated pipeline and production company
to compete in world markets.
In deciding whether to accept the commission's recommendations, ministers
will have to answer some awkward questions.
Are they prepared to see an end to the system under which all domestic
customers pay the same for each unit of gas? Unbridled competition could
lead to prices going up for people who use little gas, such as the elderly,
and those living in remote rural areas. Although heavy users and
city-dwellers should benefit from competition, the government may feel
uncomfortable if vulnerable groups end up with higher bills.
Who should pay for the costs of divestiture? The commission has recommended
that the costs are passed through to customers - a proposal that pleases
British Gas. But the public will be rightly concerned if shareholders, who
have already done well since privatisation, seem to benefit at the expense
of customers.
Quick answers are not likely. Nor are they desirable since most interested
parties will not have access to the commission's full reports until next
month. But the pro-competitive stance of these reports is the right one:
action should follow.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Keating's haul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Paul Keating's Labor party unexpectedly won the Australian general
election last March, everybody knew victory had its price. Yesterday's
federal budget made clear the cost: a growing problem with public sector and
current account deficits, rising taxes and a risk that the government's
hard-won grip on inflation may begin to slide.
Promises by Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, of sustained job
creation seem wishful: despite fiscal stimulus, unemployment remains stuck
above 10.7 per cent of the workforce. Reaffirmed intentions to cut the
budget deficit from a record ADollars 16bn to ADollars 6bn, or 1 per cent of
gross domestic product, by 1996-97 seem more fanciful still in light of
hesitant economic growth. For all its strides in streamlining the economy in
recent years, the government now has its work cut out to preserve
credibility with financial markets and to boost its political capital at
home - and another election is less than three years away.
Mr Dawkins will no doubt make much of having kept a pledge to reduce
personal tax rates this November. But this should not be allowed to hide the
government's embarrassment at having to junk a second promised round of tax
cuts later. Nor, given the way Mr Keating focused his campaign fire on
opposition plans for a sales tax, can he escape the charge that he is doing
something similar by raising indirect taxes.
More worrying is the impression that the government has no clear medium-term
strategy for controlling public expenditure. Mr Dawkins talked yesterday of
further cuts in defence spending, and even of tightening up on the social
security budget - although Mr Keating had insisted on the stump that there
was no fat to cut. With national savings at their lowest for 30 years, the
government will thus need to raise new direct taxes as well as broadening
indirect taxation if it is to have a hope of meeting its deficit target.
Ultimately, however, Australia's biggest problem is slow growth. GDP is
forecast to rise this fiscal year by 2.75 per cent - less than is needed to
maintain per capita income. Only through faster growth will Messrs Keating
and Dawkins create the employment needed to secure re-election - and that,
sadly for them, is largely beyond their control.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Old guard hangs on: Political infighting in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's Kuomintang, the ruling nationalist party, has overseen the island's
extraordinary economic development since it was driven out of China by the
Communists in 1949. But internal disputes are threatening to tear it apart
and end its dominance.
President Lee Teng-hui, addressing the party's 14th congress this week,
acknowledged that the party was plagued by factional struggles.
'Implementing internal reform (of the party) is more difficult than tackling
external challenges,' he said.
The pressures on the KMT are similar to those faced by a number of
long-standing ruling parties in Asian countries, where rapidly growing
prosperity has fostered pluralism, democratisation, and a distaste for
corruption.
In Japan, disillusionment with the Liberal Democratic party, especially over
corruption in high places, has just ended its long hold on power. In South
Korea, President Kim Young-sam, the opposition campaigner who became the
candidate of the ruling conservative party, has launched a crackdown on
bureaucratic corruption. Even in China, the communist government has found
it necessary to take a stern line on official malpractice, which has
mushroomed in the current economic boom.
'A lot of the old ruling parties are going to have to come to terms with the
corruption that they tolerated and indeed benefited from,' says Mr Peter
Ferdinand, director of the Asia programme at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London.
In Taiwan, there is an additional element in domestic political struggles:
the relationship with mainland China. The opposition Democratic Progressive
party has called for a formal declaration of independence from China. The
KMT is officially against this, although factions within it differ on how
strongly to oppose such a move. All are conscious that Beijing, for which
the top long-term foreign policy goal is reabsorption of Taiwan, would view
with great concern any shift which looked likely to lead to a formal
declaration of independence.
Last week, six members of the Yuan, Taiwan's legislature, broke away to
establish the New party, attacking the KMT's corruption. One of them, Mr Lee
Ching-hwa, son of a reformer prime minister, said: 'The old KMT is going in
the direction of money politics, dictatorial policies and Taiwan
independence, while the New party is opposed to all of these.'
This week's congress has shown that their departure has not ended internal
dissidence. President Lee had to give way to rebels yesterday and make
concessions on the election of party vice-chairmen. They are likely to be
leaders of the faction harking back to the KMT's mainland origins, whose
influence he has been seeking to reduce.
The arguments within the party have been growing for decades. Until recent
years, the KMT's right to hold power and its methods were unquestioned. Its
leader, Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan with 2m soldiers, bureaucrats and
others in 1949, driven out by Mao Zedong. Their stay was intended to be only
temporary, the prelude to a return to the mainland, since they regarded
themselves as the rightful rulers of China. Firm government and martial law
were needed because of the constant military stand-off with the mainland.
But as the years have passed, that pretext has become outmoded. Though China
remains determined to reabsorb Taiwan, the threat of imminent military
action to achieve this goal has receded. Mr Chiang's son and successor,
Chiang Ching-kuo, realised that the KMT would have to strike roots in
Taiwan. People born in Taiwan have increasingly dominated the KMT,
displacing the 'mainlanders'.
Mr Lee, who took over as president in 1988, overcame resistance from
Chiang-era KMT elders to carry out political reforms including elections of
the National Assembly in December 1991 and the Legislative Yuan in December
1992. The effect has been to strengthen the power of Taiwan-born politicians
at the expense of those who saw Taiwan's future bound up in that of mainland
China.
While the KMT has yet to face a serious external challenge to its control,
its attempt to transform itself from an authoritarian revolutionary party
into an electoral machine has not been smooth. The congress is intended to
speed the process.
Its showing in last December's legislative elections, when the Democratic
Progressive party - the main opposition party - won 52 seats compared with
the KMT's 102, underlined growing disquiet at its policies and practices.
The KMT is finding it hard to adapt to democracy. Accustomed to decreeing
measures and seeing their successful implementation, it has found itself
forced to backtrack several times in recent months.
Its ambitious six-year Dollars 300bn (Pounds 201bn) plan for massive
improvement of the island's infrastructure has had to be delayed and scaled
down amid political and financing problems. Last month, parliamentary
defeats forced it to cancel a Dollars 17bn high-speed railway project.
Though the party has long had open factions, party leaders have been
accustomed to iron discipline. Now, however, they have found themselves
floundering in their dealings with dissidents.
The party has also been undermined by the success of its economic policies,
which have fostered highly efficient industrial companies. Independent
businessmen resent the preferential treatment afforded to companies within
the KMT's own extensive corporate holdings.
At the root of the KMT's problems, however, remain divisions between the
'mainlanders' and Taiwanese-born. Mr Lee has succeeded in putting virtually
all arms of government under the control of people who, like him, were born
in Taiwan. But yesterday's developments, and the formation of the New party,
have shown how difficult it is for him to exorcise the mainlanders'
influence.
There are few signs that the KMT leadership is taking firm action to produce
new policies and internal reforms which will satisfy the party's dissidents.
If it does not, it could face a growing electoral challenge from the New
party. A first test will be local elections later this year. Success for the
New party could create a three-party system representing a range of views on
China, from independence to closer links, perhaps with the KMT occupying the
middle ground.
The transition to a more complex democracy will be viewed closely by the
west - which wants to avoid Taiwan's status leading to eventual conflict
with China - and by the island's Asian neighbours, especially China itself.
Mr Ferdinand, of the Royal Institute, notes that 'the power of Taiwan to
serve as a model for the rest of China should not be underestimated'.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Personal View: Good and bad of managed trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By C FRED BERGSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are widespread concerns that managed trade is coming to dominate US -
and perhaps global - commercial policy. Some reviewers - including Michael
Prowse in the Financial Times on June 25 - have attacked my new book,
Reconcilable Differences? United States-Japan Economic Conflict (co-written
by Marcus Noland, now senior international economist at the Council of
Economic Advisers), as supporting such an approach. Some have similarly
attacked Laura Tyson's book, Who's Bashing Whom? Trade Conflict in
High-Technology Industries, published by the Institute for International
Economics last November*.
Neither Mr Noland and I, nor Ms Tyson, chairman of the council, believe that
trade policy measures can solve 'the Japan problem'. Japan's huge and
growing global current account surplus must be reduced primarily by
maintaining a strong yen and by restoring vigorous growth in Japan's
domestic demand.
The US must correct its budget deficit and adopt domestic measures to
strengthen its competitiveness, as the administration of President Bill
Clinton is beginning to do.
Our writings flatly reject protectionism. We remain devoted to an open and
multilateral trading system. We also believe that aggressive efforts to open
the Japanese market are essential.
However, there is enormous confusion over both the meaning of the term
'managed trade' and its recent history.
There are two different types of managed trade. The traditional version,
usually implemented via voluntary export restraint agreements (VERs),
restricts trade and closes markets. It raises prices, reduces competition
and reinforces cartel behaviour. It is the most insidious form of
protectionism, creating unholy alliances between shielded import-competing
industries, which are guaranteed market share, and exporters, who are
suddenly licensed to jack up prices and reap windfall profits.
The Reagan administration specialised in this type of managed trade. It
negotiated VERs with Japan on cars, steel and machine tools. The then
secretary of the Treasury, James Baker, proudly proclaimed that Mr Ronald
Reagan had 'granted more import relief to US industry than any of his
predecessors in more than half a century'.
The Clinton administration has adopted no such arrangements. Mr Noland and I
flatly reject them, as does Ms Tyson.
The second type of managed trade, sometimes pursued via voluntary import
expansion agreements (VIEs), aims to increase the participation of imports
in protected foreign markets. It seeks to increase trade and open markets to
new competitors. Implemented properly, it reduces prices and enhances
competition.
The Bush administration employed this type of managed trade in several
cases. It extended the Reagan VIE in semiconductors and pushed Japan into
new VIEs in cars and car parts. Mr Clinton has negotiated no VIEs but has
raised the possibility with Japan.
Mr Noland and I espouse the use of such agreements to expand exports in
certain carefully circumscribed cir-cumstances, as does Ms Tyson.
VIEs may be necessary in markets that deny access to foreigners through a
web of opaque exclusionary practices that cannot be addressed by the usual
tools of trade policy.
Mr Noland and I analysed 12 sectors of the Japanese economy, ranging from
agriculture, high-technology and medium-technology manufacturing to
financial and other services. We found a pervasive pattern of exclusionary
corporate practices coupled with government intervention. Some of those
interventions, especially those that curbed imports directly, have
disappeared but they have left a profound legacy of market closure.
The preferred response to such market closure is to identify and abolish the
offending government policy, such as discriminatory public procurement. This
can be done through the multilateral procedures of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade - antitrust policy is the proper counter to restrictive
corporate practices.
Unfortunately, tackling restrictive government policy by taking action
through the Gatt is often impossible, even when Japanese access limitations
can be clearly discerned. VIEs may be the only way to introduce new entrants
into some closed sectors in Japan. Even Japan's former prime minister, Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, publicly solicited foreign pressure to help Japan change.
The Reagan-Bush semiconductor VIE illustrates the proper use of managed
trade to promote exports. Market access was clearly limited: Japan's import
share never rose above 10 per cent-12 per cent, despite the competitive
position of non-Japanese companies in other markets and huge changes in all
the most important economic variables. At least partly as a result of the
VIE, sales to Japan from Europe, Korea, other Asian countries and the US
have increased to about 20 per cent of the market.
More important, Japanese end-users sought out foreign suppliers for the
first time and began to design their chips into the production process.
Competition and world economic welfare have improved as a result.
Why do some free traders oppose a device that expands trade?
Some confuse policy targets and policy instruments. Both VERs and VIEs
require government intervention in markets. Hence many observers
instinctively denounce VIEs even though they seek, as US undersecretary of
the Treasury Lawrence Summers puts it, to unmanage rather than manage trade.
There are, however, significant practical problems with VIEs. Any numerical
target is bound to be arbitrary; it is far superior to use a range of
qualitative and quantitative indicators rather than a single market share.
No government can control the outcome; changes in the market, in growth
rates or in exchange rates can frustrate even the most faithful com-pliance.
A dangerous dynamic is thus set in motion: the US administration will be
attacked as soft if it fails to retaliate against an unmet target - even if
all parties know that the failure had nothing to do with Japanese effort -
but subjects itself to legitimate counter-retaliation if it does so.
Moreover, VIEs must be used only for temporary periods. They apply only to
intermediate industrial products, not consumer goods bought by millions of
individuals. They must be open to all imports, unlike the Bush VIEs on cars
and car parts, which are limited to US companies and are a blatant
invitation to divert sales from other supplying countries  - an invitation
that Mr Clinton has firmly rejected.
The problems of applying VIEs are thus formidable. They should be used
sparingly and only with the utmost care by the US and Japanese governments
as they pursue their forthcoming sectoral nego-tiations.
However, it should be clear that there is an enormous difference in
principle between the two types of managed trade. It is analytically
incorrect to equate both with protectionism. VERs are clearly protectionist
and should be resisted. But VIEs expand trade and may be needed on occasion.
Their judicious use can help Japanese consumers, foreign producers and the
prospects for maintaining an open trading system.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Interim managers can speed up
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD MCKEOWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lucy Kellaway's excellent article, 'Troubleshooters for hire' (August
9), postulates a future of more self-employed, project-focused,
knowledge-based interim managers, with companies employing fewer very senior
executives to hire and co-ordinate the short-term specialists.
The effect of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic is surely speeding
up this process.
More companies, stripped of massive structures and now lean and fit, are
reorganising tasks into part-time or ad hoc projects and are turning to
networks of independent specialists or leased executives for help. In some
cases those specialists are former employees now operating independ-ently
and available for hire.
There are a lot of motivated quality people in the marketplace ready to
tackle short-term projects, fill temporary gaps or take on part-time posts.
I speak from experience, having been a professional interim manager for five
years with a continuing flow of projects.
Smaller and medium-sized companies could probably benefit from this resource
to speed up recovery. But it is also up to independents to market themselves
and seize such opportunities.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Leaving school' (August 10) summarised the dilemma facing
pupils in the 14-19 age group in the UK educational system. The changes to
the national curriculum and the transformation of GNVQ into vocational
A-levels will help to bridge the divide between the academic and vocational
routes, but the apparent stigma of the work-based vocational route after the
age of 16 still remains.
There can be no escaping the fact that for a significant proportion of
16-year-olds staying on at school is not the most appropriate method of
personal development, and the acquisition of skills is best achieved in a
job with structured training leading to vocational qualifications.
The enhancement of the image of this route is just as important as the
elevation of GNVQ, and an acknowledgement of the value of the apprenticeship
approach by schools and government would do much to achieve parity of esteem
across the whole spectrum of education.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Grant schools are audited properly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID WALSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Funds at risk in opt-out schools' (August 12) outlined
the criticisms of Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the Audit Commission, over
the audit arrangements for grant-maintained schools.
My company has been involved in the grant-maintained schools sector from
early on and we currently act as auditors to a number of such schools. In
every case, we have gone through the rigorous selection procedure set down
by the Department of Education. Once appointed, our terms of engagement are
definitively set out in a letter of engagement detailing the respective
roles and responsibilities of the auditors and the governing body. We are
appointed not by school staff but by the governing body of the school. I
believe that this provides the independence that Sir David claims does not
exist.
I also take issue with Sir David's claim that personnel within
grant-maintained schools are unfamiliar with handling public finances.
Invariably the schools have a history of setting and operating their budgets
and controlling and recording income and expenditure within their local
education authority's management scheme. On incorporation, grant-maintained
schools are funded directly by the Department of Education; it seems that
Sir David considers local authority funds to be less 'public' than those of
central government.
The work of the independent registered auditors is also subject to
monitoring by their regulatory bodies. I object to Sir David's implication
that the Audit Commission is more likely to detect misuse or
misappropriation of funds than the independent sector.
Finally, if Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, had taken the time
to familiarise herself with the audit requirements issued by the Department
of Education to all grant-maintained schools she would have known that they
are indeed answerable to statutory audit procedures.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Coal need not make electricity
expensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A D J HORSLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There was much with which I agreed in your editorial 'In the pit'
(August 16). But your statements that 'coal is a dirty and expensive form of
generating electricity', and that changing the energy market by, for
example, restricting gas-fired stations, closing nuclear plants or halting
imports of French electricity 'would impose higher electricity costs on
British businesses and consumers' cannot go unchallenged.
If new power stations are to be built, coal is at present a more expensive
source of generation than gas. But why do we need new stations now when
there is already surplus capacity? High-efficiency coal-fired power stations
will be forced to operate at greatly reduced output and the consumer is
having to pay a return on unnecessary investment. This may well be one of
the reasons behind the surge in electricity pool prices this summer, which
has so disturbed consumers and Offer, the electricity watchdog.
As pointed out in the Commons trade and industry select committee report in
January, the cost of electricity from existing power stations  - even
allowing for the addition of flue gas desulphurisation when needed - is
cheaper than that from many new gas-fired stations, and will become more so
with the continuing decline in British Coal prices. The stimulus for much
gas-fired generation has been provided by rivalry between regional
electricity companies and generators, rather than by underlying economics.
As to nuclear, it is hard for a coal business struggling for survival to see
it implied that nuclear power, dependent for almost half its income in
England and Wales on a levy on other forms of generation, is somehow driving
out coal on cost grounds.
The attraction of imported electricity depends on the classification of
power imported over the link with France as 'non-leviable'. This means, in
effect, that wholesale purchasers of that power in the UK can afford to pay
more for the power because they are still collecting the levy on their
sales, but do not need to pass it to the French. The select committee
pointed out that 'far from providing cheap electricity, Electricite de
France has provided some of the more expensive baseload supplies'.
That the government decided not to make any fundamental changes in the
electricity market as a result of the coal review is a matter of record.
That to have done so would have led to higher costs to consumers is not.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Arts: A new 'Foscari' and a concert 'Cos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the end of this decade there will be no such thing as rare Verdi. The
Royal Opera's grand design of staging all the Verdi operas in time for the
centenary of the composer's death in 2001 is already causing ripples of
activity away from London, where the productions of some of the early operas
are being seen first.
I due Foscari is one of them - a co-production between the Royal Opera and
Scottish Opera. Although widely neglected for being excessively gloomy, this
is in fact one early Verdi work which British audiences have seen relatively
recently, when English National Opera put it on in the late 1970s. On that
occasion economy imposed an ironic twist upon the opera: painted backdrops
were borrowed from Johann Strauss's comic operetta A Night in Venice with
the result that Verdi's tragedy was played out in front of pretty
picture-postcard sets.
None of that here. The production team at Scottish Opera - Howard Davies
(producer) and Ashley Martin-Davies (designer) - had shut out any glimpse of
Venetian canals, piazzas and watery vistas. They stress the dark, indoor
drama about the city's shady political activities with the Venetian Council
of Ten meeting in secret session to pronounce harsh judgments on those who
have transgressed its laws.
Theirs is a Venice of austere simplicity. The same bare hallway affords
access to the council-chamber and doubles as the dungeon, when prison-bars
are lowered across the stage. For the council-scene itself rows of seats pop
up through the floor, not without some mechanical hitches; coat-hangers
conveniently descend from the ceiling when the councillors need to don their
robes.
As in so many Verdi productions at the moment, the councillors wear everyday
clothes of the composer's period, but robe themselves for duty in medieval
style (as though to emphasise Verdi's choice of a 15th-century story to
clothe his 19th-century political views). No matter what they wear, the
Scottish Opera chorus seems to sing splendidly at the moment and the
orchestra was in no less fine form. Richard Armstrong made a name for
himself early on with his Verdi conducting and this I due Foscari was
vigorous, rhythmical, energetic.
At a time when Verdi singers of calibre are hard to find, the company has
not fared badly. The Chinese tenor Deng (no Christian name, easier to spell
than Pavarotti) is an interesting addition to the ranks of Italian-opera
tenors. He is no actor, though he enjoys himself staggering about as the
condemned Jacopo Foscari, covered in tomato ketchup. His singing is
confident, plausibly Italianate in sound, though not in vocal mannerisms.
First-night nerves unfortunately had the soprano, Katerina Kudriavchenko,
wandering all over the place in pitch during her poetic entrance aria. She
has the quiet, floated top notes for it, though, and enough force in a venue
the size of the King's Theatre to give Lucrezia's big moments some punch.
Her Italian is indistinct. The young tenor Richard Coxon made his mark as
Barbarigo; Nicolas Cavallier sang with firm, youthful bass tone as Loredano.
The scene was set for a reasonable show, when fate intervened. The baritone
Frederick Burchinal, the evening's Francesco Foscari, went down with
bronchitis and elected to act his role while it was sung for him from the
wings. This is never a satisfactory solution and it would surely have been
better for everybody if Phillip Joll had been allowed to complement his
proudly stentorian singing by playing the character, however simply, on
stage.
Scottish Opera's Managing Director announced wittily to the audience that
this was a performance when they would get 'I tre Foscari' - a good line,
but next time a different solution would be preferred. Otherwise Verdi was
well enough served. (Sponsored by Hertz.)
*****
When you go back to a masterpiece you know, you find that you don't know it.
Its component parts add up to something new in your mind, and you find new
meanings in it. This is probably more so with Cos fan tutte than with any
other Mozart opera. The balance between delight and pain in its tale of love
is always different. The women's betrayal of their fiances - cos fan tutte,
all women do so - and the men's efforts to find them false: the degrees of
feeling, folly, irresponsibility, heartlessness, in all this are forever
shifting.
When Charles Mackerras conducts Cos fan tutte, he often heightens your sense
of unfamiliarity by his way with the text. He customarily adds ornaments,
opens cuts, and chooses lesser-known alternative versions of certain
numbers; and so it was in Monday's Usher Hall concert performance -
employing a text different in several details from the Cos he conducted with
Welsh National a few seasons ago. Guglielmo's first aria was given in a
little-known version, Despina and Alfonso sang their duet, Ferrando sang all
his arias, acres of oft-deleted recitative was restored. And all of it was
alive, spontaneous.
And sparkling. The opera's latterday commentators often exaggerate its
quasi-tragic pains. True, if there is a key word in da Ponte's libretto, it
is tradimento (betrayal); the women at the end admit that they deserve to
die for it. But Mackerras reminds us that Cos, not least when dealing with
betrayal, is both fun and sensuous. The libretto, after all, is full of
oxymora - 'sweet pain,' 'dear sighs,' and so on. Those who enter this
opera's cruel trap are also those who find most bliss there.
The world-class cast was an appealing mix. At its core was Felicity Lott
(ravishingly attired) as Fiordiligi: utmost elegance, liquid phrasing,
gleaming tone, vivid diction, thrilling dignity, tenderest emotion - an
ideal exemplum of multi-faceted sensibility. Marie McLaughlin (a potential
Fiordiligi who has recorded Despina) sang Dorabella with Latin warmth and
impulsiveness, equally natural in the tragedy-queen heroics of her first
aria and the delicious erotic surrender of the second. (Both her gown and
her hairdo had one idea too many, which could be in character.)
Jerry Hadley plays Ferrando as a callous buffoon, a prat whose prank
pratfalls himself. He brought off all three arias with fluency - but why so
loud? He even orated the climactic seduction duet as if to a packed forum.
Alessandro Corbelli, though often drowned by Hadley in ensemble, is a
Guglielmo who illumined the rarely-heard 'Rivolgete a lui' and other
passages with firm tone and vivid utterance. Nuccia Focile's pellucid,
bright Despina and Gilles Cachemaille's detached, urbane Alfonso both know
the way of the world so well that they hardly seem to steer events at all -
they just nudge things along their natural course.
All praise to the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, playing for Mackerras with
panache, luscious tone and wit. Though the great solos and duets of this Cos
were warmly applauded, its great events were its larger ensembles. These so
fizzed with dancing rhythms and changing dynamics that we, spectators,
became as helplessly involved as any participant onstage.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Arts: Sellars kills off Aeschylus - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may not believe it on the evidence of this production, but The Persians
is a very powerful anti-war play. First performed in 472 BC, it went back to
the Athenian victory over the Persians eight years earlier. Many of the
members of the first audience must have fought in the war as, it is claimed,
did Aeschylus himself.
Apart from being a strong-structured piece in its own right, the play is
remarkable for its sympathetic attitude to the Persians. There is no
Athenian triumphalism and the horrors of war are shown from the losing
Persian side.
There are some similarities with the recent war in the Gulf, although not as
many as the director, Peter Sellars, pretends. For example, the Persians in
480 BC must have had reasonable expectation of winning. In the Gulf War only
a fanatic could have thought that Iraq could stand up to the air power of
the US and its coalition of forces. It was a different kind of contest.
Where Sellars is on stronger ground in pursuing analogies is that Xerxes,
the Persian leader, survived despite the loss of many of his troops. A
parallel with Saddam Hussein is thus not far-fetched and there is certainly
nothing wrong with seeking to give ancient plays a modern edge.
The key question is whether the deliberate insertion of modernity sharpens
or blunts the message. We can safely assume, I think, that any audience
going to see The Persians is going to be fairly intelligent, capable of
drawing its own comparisons between warfare past and present and probably
enjoying reflecting on immutability.
From an ideal production of The Persians - namely the original play - an
audience would come away marvelling at the wisdom and foresight of
Aeschylus. From the Edinburgh production the temptation, to which I fully
succumb, is to curse the perversity and tricksiness of Sellars. It does not
add to the pathos periodically to introduce the sound of American aircraft
bombing Baghdad, nor does it help to have the characters speaking through
microphones as a symbol of the way the war in the Gulf was covered by CNN.
It is Aeschylus who has been killed.
There are other defects. The original has a strong chorus and a powerful
part for the messenger who brings the bad news. Neither have much prominence
here, yet they are surely central to the play, the chorus for its comments
and the messenger for his graphic description of the Persian losses. Again,
the original gives some striking lines to the ghost of Darius, father of
Xerxes. Here the ghost is dressed in a long white nightgown and communicates
in deaf and dumb language with the words coming through a microphone
offstage: they are not all the words of Aeschylus.
The production, intended as the opening theatrical showpiece of the
Festival, runs at the Royal Lyceum for the rest of this week.
*****
The only reservation about the Red Shift company's production of Death In
Venice is how far it will make sense if you are unfamiliar with the story.
Thomas Mann's masterly short novel has already been turned into a movie by
Visconti and an opera by Benjamin Britten. A stage version, however, is an
even bigger challenge because of the need for greater dialogue. The novel
depends heavily on the writing style and the imagination.
Red Shift pulls it off by preserving what dialogue there is and distributing
the narrative text among the characters. Members of the cast play several
roles without the panoply of a full change in costume. At the same time,
there is one central character, Gustave von Aschenbach, the Mann-like figure
who goes to Venice, becomes infatuated with a young boy whom he scarcely
dares approach, and then dies of cholera. Aschenbach is played by Michael
Sheldon who captures the loneliness of the well-known writer whose very
success makes him feel cut off from the rest of society. Sheldon does it
with exquisite delicacy, never lapsing into sentimentality.
The company also has a distinctive style with sets: spare, but suggestive
and functional. Three panels of dark and light blue are enough to show the
sea and the sky outside Venice. Columns open up to allow a hotel reception
desk and an altar to descend with the minimum of fuss. Jonathan Holloway
directs, the design is by David Roger.
The production plays at the Assembly Rooms throughout the Festival before a
spell at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, then a nation-wide tour. It is
sponsored Di Saronno Amaretto.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dudley Moore's career has been a striking manifestation of the Peter
Principle (which, you may recall, states that people are promoted until they
reach a level at which they prove to be incompetent). As a young man, in
partnership with Peter Cook, he was superb in the BBC series Not Only But
Also. Watch any of the 'Dagenham Dialogues' - if it's a good painting the
eyes, or the bottoms, follow you round the room; always count railings
otherwise something awful will happen - and they work as well today as they
did in the 1960s. Then he was accepted as a film actor, a job where you
would have to say he was, at best, mediocre.
More recently he has been used, back on television, as the presenter of
didactic music series, a role in which he proved in Orchestra] to be
embarrassingly bad. Why, then, is he now appearing in a similar series
called Concerto]? Presumably because, in television, nothing succeeds like
familiarity. The opening programme on Channel 4 on Sunday featured Michael
Tilson Thomas, who showed in the recent BBC programme about Beethoven's 5th
Symphony that he was such an impressive conductor/presenter, and soloists
James Galway and Marisa Robles, both charming and articulate. So why did
anybody think it a good idea to bring in Moore with his Goon voices and
facetiousness? Presumably the reasoning is that those thickies out there in
front of their sets will never accept musical analysis without the sugar
coating of comedy - and Dudley Moore is funny, isn't he? Not in Concerto]
he's not.
*****
The impressionists on Spitting Image have a lot to answer for. Nowadays we
all think we know how Prince Charles sounds when chatting with his friends.
Keeping your teeth gripped firmly together and speaking through your nose
say 'Shall we take a walk rind the grinds? It's all dine to Mother Thingy in
the end isn't it? You know, Nature'. So strong is our certainty that this is
how he sounds that it came as a great surprise to find him talking only a
little like that in ITV's Survival Special 'Highgrove, Nature's Kingdom' on
Friday. True, he had a walking stick so long that he had to reach up to hold
it, but generally speaking he came across as quite sane. The programme was
of a remarkably old fashioned type, close to the original Disney wildlife
model, with superb pictures by Maurice Tibbles (the fox in the foreground
with the rabbit sitting stock still in the background, for instance) but a
fatuously condescending commentary: 'Conservation doesn't necessarily mean
preserving everything . . . spring is a busy time on the farm . . . the
horse was domesticated by man long ago'. Gosh, no, really?
*****
Some have claimed that in Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy on BBC2 the third
part was better than the second and the second better than the first. To me
they seemed quite consistent: all excellent. The first, set in a betting
shop, was a Chekhovian lament about provincialism and the virtues of loyalty
to your roots versus the attractions of escape. The second, set in the ante
room to a snooker hall, while still concerned with small town mentality,
looked at pecking orders, crime and hypocrisy. The third, set in the vestry
and belfry of a church, featured a sexually naive sacristan, an adulterous
wife and a wise innocent. They did more to make you think than an entire
year's supply of glossily filmed mini-series. Let us hope that this
tremendously successful transfer from stage to screen has reminded Charles
Denton, BBC Television's new head of drama, that there is infinite life in
studio production.
*****
The 'up to' habit is spreading like couch grass through television news
rooms and it should be ripped out and banished immediately. When they tell
us 'At least Pounds 1m was stolen' that is fair enough; it means that a
minimum of Pounds 1m was involved so that, whatever the precise figure, this
was a significant event. But to say 'Up to Pounds 1m was stolen', as they
did on the BBC's south east regional news, is meaningless. It could mean
that Pounds 999,999 was stolen or that Pounds 1 was stolen. If they mean
'About Pounds 1m was stolen' they should say so. Similarly with casualty
figures: 'Up to 10 people were killed' is nonsense whereas 'At least eight'
makes sense.
*****
The success achieved by the BBC's Community Programmes Unit (responsible for
access programmes such as Open Door) in dishing out video cameras to members
of the public and getting them to make programmes about their own lives is
remarkable. Video Diaries has produced some of the most powerful
documentaries we have seen in the last couple of years, and the current
series of Teenage Diaries on BBC2 on Saturdays is proving that this was no
flash in the pan. Though the camera is in the subject's own hands the
content does not always endear the subject to the viewer. Indeed the
programmes in this series so far - made by a fatherless, husbandless 15-year
old mother; an astonishing Portuguese boy musician; a school-hating
13-year-old girl with a shaven head; and the 12-year-old daughter of
single-parent mother - have left some viewers seething and muttering about
fecklessness, conceit, mollycoddling and scrounging off the state. But that,
surely, is an indication of the effectiveness of the form. It would be
interesting to know just how much of the editing, music laying, and tripod
mounted footage is really the work of the teenagers, but even if the fine
professional hands of the unit do intrude more than we might guess, this is
still a most impressive series.
*****
Yet again coverage by a foreign broadcaster of a big sporting occasion is
revealing by default the extraordinarily high standards of the BBC's own
sports coverage. German (presumably) coverage of the marathon at the World
Championships in Stuttgart gave us overhead shots of a completely deserted
road, shots of athletes from the waist down so that they were
unidentifiable, pointless shots of the helicopter which was doubtless
providing the pictures of the deserted road, and a crucial time gap between
the first and second runners which must have been wrong unless the chasing
runner got a lift on one of the motorbikes. Where a BBC camera crew would
have been well prepared for Konchella's astounding finish in the 800 metres,
the Germans were taken entirely by surprise, and so on. If you enjoy
athletics it is all deeply irritating except insofar as it highlights the
home grown excellence that we are so used to.
*****
The time has come, if not for a complete retraction, at least for a
reappraisal. When Pandora's Box was first shown I found the thesis in the
opening episode, about attempts by Soviet Russia to run a 'scientific'
state, wholly unpersuasive, feeling that blame was being laid at the door of
science when it should have been that of politics. I took little notice of
the rest of the series, but the repeats on BBC2 on Thursdays are showing
that to have been a mistake. The episode two weeks ago on the faith that was
placed in DDT just after the war, then the launch of the ecology movement
with Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring', followed by a new wave of blind faith
in Mother Nature, was a profoundly sane programme. And although this pink
newsprint may seem an odd place to be saying so, last Thursday's systematic
expose of the ineffectuality of the 'science' of economics, at least as
practised in Britain since 1945, was masterly. I now look forward eagerly to
tomorrow's programme about the chaps at the Rand Corporation, the first
'scientific' think-tank, who believed in the balance of terror and provided
Hollywood with the models for Dr Strangelove.

BBC2's generally good series of sports documentaries On The Line deals today
with England's first-class cricket umpires. Who knew that after a county
match umpires are 'marked' by the team captains? With only a seasonal
contract and the sort of intimidation of umpires now practised by players,
the job looks pretty unappealing (8.30).
The penultimate offering in BBC2's season of drama repeats from the 1960s
and 70s, The Wednesday Play, is 'Hard Labour', devised by Mike Leigh, and
with a cast that includes Bernard Hill, Ben Kingsley and Alison Steadman.
(9.00). The star is Liz Smith who plays a put-upon housewife and char.
In its 'gay' season Channel 4 shows the movie The Hours And Times, an
account of an imaginary weekend in Barcelona in 1963 with John Lennon
resisting the advances of Beatles' manager Brian Epstein.
ITV pursues its fixation upon crime and punishment with a 2 1/2 hour drama
documentary about a young criminal who killed himself in Swansea prison
three years ago, 15: The Life And Death Of Philip Knight (9.00).

From the outside, the Saint Ouen waste incineration plant on the outskirts

roofs and elegantly circling approach roads at the back.
Inside, the computerised control room resembles a research laboratory, well
endowed with high technology.
Only the faint smell of garbage betrays the fact that this is the place
where the community's rubbish ends up each day.
Built two years ago, the Saint Ouen plant incorporates the latest technology
for household waste incineration.
It is run on a 24-hour basis by a crew of eight and has the capacity to burn
630,000 tonnes of garbage a year. The energy gained from the burning process
is then used to heat 70,000 flats in Paris.
In the view of the Brussels-based Association of Plastic Manufacturers in
Europe, the modern French waste incinerator shows that burning household
waste in order to produce energy is far more economical and ecological than
recycling the accumulated waste.
APME has been fighting a rearguard battle to promote incineration technology
in Europe.
Its lobbying efforts have increased recently as the European Commission
debates a packaging directive which would force the member countries to
adopt similar parameters in the disposal of household waste.
The Commission is due this autumn to adopt a directive which will set the
recycling quotas for all EC member countries.
Plastics make up only a small portion of the packaging found in household
bins, but they have become a testing ground for legislators across Europe.
Lightweight plastics especially, such as yoghurt pots or cheese wrappers,
are at the centre of a growing battle between French and German legislators
who hold opposing views on the recycling -versus-incineration issue.
France argues that household waste can be incinerated before it is put on
landfills.
And it has developed modern waste technology which enables the incineration
to be conducted without toxic emissions.
But Germany wants the EC directive to follow its own national legislation.
Under the influence of the strongest pro-environment lobbies in Europe,
Germany has adopted strict recycling laws for waste packaging which prevent
incineration - this is in spite of the fact that the modern incinerators are
environmentally friendly.
The headache for ministers in Brussels is how to reconcile both views in its
directive.
It must also set the limits for the recycling quotas and decide what
pressure should be applied to meet them.
The aim of the EC directive is to curb the growing mountains of household
waste which are at present dumped on landfills across Europe. As space for
landfills has become scarce, awareness of its environmental impact has
increased.
But the directive must also harmonise existing household waste recycling
laws in Europe to ensure that different national waste packaging laws do not
prevent particular packaging forms from being sold throughout the community.
The issues have become more urgent recently amid problems with Germany's
strict waste packaging law, which sets high recycling targets and forbids
incineration.
Flaws in Germany's waste management scheme surfaced when the much-vaunted
national recycling scheme, Duales System Deutschland, recently announced it
was on the verge of bankruptcy.
German law states that only 100,000 tonnes of plastics can be recycled this
year, but the diligence of Germans in separating their rubbish and the
efficiency of DSD in collecting it means that 400,000 tonnes of plastic
packaging is likely for collection.
The excess rubbish has increasingly resulted in waste paper and glass being
exported to neighbouring countries.
In the case of plastics, Germany's insufficient domestic recycling capacity
has led either to yet more controversial exports or to the equally disliked
local storage of waste plastic.
This inability of DSD to recycle the small household plastic waste
packagings has also intensified the debate on whether recycling should be
compulsory in member countries.
According to APME, the problem with the German law is that it attempts to
recycle all forms of packaging, including those containing mixed materials
which are often difficult to sort from other rubbish forms.
APME says that lightweight plastic packaging should be incinerated.
In the Saint Ouen plant, for example, small plastics, which are not
separately collected as in Germany, are used as fuel to burn the household
waste.
But the German government is locked in an awkward position. The public
perceives incineration as detrimental to the environment, even when energy
is recovered. 'More than any country in Europe, Germany is suffering from
the nimby syndrome - the not-in-my-backyard syndrome,' says Franz
Fraundorfer, a consultant in the German-based office of Arthur D. Little,
the US management consultancy.
Helmut Schnurer, state secretary at the German federal environment ministry
explains: 'We need new incinerators but we are meeting enormous local
resistance.'
The government is aware, however, that modern incinerators are
environmentally friendly and can make more economic sense. Incineration
will, in fact, be allowed as an alternative to recycling in its forthcoming
law on recycling consumer durables.
This will mean the building of new incinerators.
'Local politicians will no longer be under the influence of local pressure
groups because they will be able to say they are simply obeying a federal
requirement,' says Schnurer.
But in the case of the controversial two-year-old packaging law, there is no
turning back. Any change would represent loss of face for the government and
for Klaus Topfer, federal environment minister and architect of Germany's
waste management laws.
Meanwhile, the Commission's solution for the waste packaging directive could
be to allow both recycling and incineration.
But this solution is unlikely to please either France or Germany.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Campaign to fell pulp producer
 -Lobbyists are urging the City not to invest in Barito Pacific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of London had its first taste of co-ordinated environmental
lobbying last week when 275 fund managers received a letter urging them not
to invest in an Indonesian wood products company, Barito Pacific.
Barito is planning a Dollars 250m (Pounds 179m) flotation on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange.
'I've been in the business over 10 years and this is the first time I've
been confronted with a situation like this. It's difficult to know how to
react,' says Simon Fraser, investment director at Fidelity Investment
Services.
The flotation, announced in early July, ran into trouble two weeks later
when Salomon Brothers withdrew as lead underwriter. Salomon's decision was
believed to be based on its concern about a lack of management information
which it is obliged to supply to the US regulatory authorities.
Environmentalists and human rights groups want to stop the proposed
expansion of Barito, one of the world's largest makers of plywood, pulp and
paper. Funds from the flotation will be used to increase the company's pulp
production and expand the area planted with industrial forests.
'The expansion is not in the interests of the environment, large numbers of
local and indigenous people whose lands have been logged by the company
without consent, or, in the longer term, the process of sustainable
development of the Indonesian economy,' says the briefing document produced
by the environmental campaigners. The covering letter is signed by 13
groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Japan Tropical
Forest Action Network.
Barito and its financial advisers presented its flotation proposal at a
meeting in the Savoy Hotel last month. Over 200 fund managers attended and
they, plus other potential City investors were subsequently sent the
campaigners' alternative analysis of Barito.
The campaigners make specific allegations about Barito's logging, financial,
social and political activities. Simon Counsell, a forests campaigner at
Friends of the Earth, says legal restrictions prevented the groups from
printing stronger claims.
One leading fund manager - who did not want to be named - was impressed with
the environmental arguments and said he believed most of the allegations. He
would not be subscribing. 'If there is an environmental cloud hanging over
this issue then I think it will sink it. This campaign could be quite
effective.'
Michael Hanson-Lawson, managing director of Crosby Securities UK, the
flotation's international co-ordinator, said the project was environmentally
sound and he would not be swayed by the campaigners' arguments. He was,
however, impressed with the efficiency of the campaign. 'They targeted the
fund managers very well - this could be an inside job.'
Environmental issues were significant in the flotation. He was sure that his
clients would read the document and take the arguments into account. But he
considered the environmental campaign to be nothing more than a 'minor
irritant'.
James Robinson of Henderson Administration found the campaigners' document
too emotive.
'They would do their cause more good if the language was less emotive. They
use phrases like 'unacceptable political connections'. Unacceptable to
whom?' He said this was one of the first times he had been approached by a
group of environmental campaigners. In future he would pay more attention to
similar approaches if their arguments were presented in a better way.
Henderson would not subscribe to the Barito issue because there was
insufficient international backing. 'We have not been swayed by the
environmental arguments,' he said.
Counsell said campaigners would continue to target fund managers and would
attempt to use the City as a lever in bringing about change. He admitted the
campaigners had much to learn in dealing with the City. 'In the past we
have, for example, successfully persuaded investors away from Fisons over
their policy on peat extraction. We are relative novices in the use of City
language, but we intend to improve,' he said.

FT  18 AUG 93 / People: New flightpath for Curt Ekstrom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Curt Ekstrom, general manager of Unisys in Sweden and a founder of Amadeus,
one of the two main European airline reservation systems, has been
headhunted as the next chief executive of Speedwing Systems. This is the
largest division within the Speedwing Group, British Airways' information
technology and consultancy services business.
He replaces 54-year-old Malcolm Dillingham, who, after three years in the
job, is moving to work on the technical aspects of BA's strategic stakes in
Qantas and USAir.
The division provides reservation, airline accounting and yield management
systems to other airlines.
Rick Wills, managing director of the Speedwing Group, says that Ekstrom's
experience at Amadeus is very valuable as 'the basic technology is very
similar; it has given him lots of transport industry contacts and both are
international companies'. Amadeus was set up by Air France, Iberia and
Lufthansa and is a direct competitor of Galileo, which is owned by BA and
KLM.
'Revenue management products in particular are going to be greatly in
demand,' according to Wills. The way an airline accounts for receipts from
passengers on complicated itineraries using several carriers has a huge
impact on cash-flow and hence profits, he argues.
Many of the smaller airlines in the eastern block use Speedwing reservation
systems, as, closer to home, does British Midland. Austrian Airlines is
among those using the accounting system.
Ekstrom, 51, also goes on the boards of Bedford Associates, Speedwing's
US-based software house, and of Speedwing Logica, a joint venture between
Logica and BA.
One of the industry's most respected IT professionals, according to BA,
Ekstrom worked his way up SAS, to become general manager of SAS DATA, the
Scandinavian airline's IT arm. He also spent four years in Bangkok, managing
Thai Airways' data processing department. He was a founder and the original
president and chief executive officer of Amadeus between 1988 and 1990.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Management: Seven routes to the top of the tree - Hard work,
motivation and a certain something can lead to business success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Success stories of business superstars are certainly as interesting and
improbable as the biographies of minor European monarchs or film stars.
Many tycoons can tell the 'teaboy-to-managing director' fable of how they
made it from humble beginnings to multi-million dollar moguls. Many of these
tales are of an occasionally moving, roller-coaster ride through early
success, false starts and repeated failure, with the only comparison on this
lonely journey being a consistent motivation to succeed.
But by definition, these auto-hagiographies are the enviable stories of
success. How people become rich is the stuff of dreams; the hope of every
lottery ticket buyer and the fantasy of every gambler. Most people have
imagined what they would do if they won the pools. However, no self-made
billionaires are such idle time wasters. They have all worked hard, for long
periods to find those extremely elusive secrets of success that lead to
mega-riches. They are proponents of the adage that 'success' comes before
'work' only in the dictionary.
The so-called secrets are of course often well known. People who have
studied the histories of business achievement have documented various
possible routes to the same end - that sweet, distinctive smell of success.
A careful examination of the main pathways to company growth has revealed
how relatively few they are in number.
Case studies have shown for instance that the success of companies such as
Walt Disney, Benetton, Korean Airlines, Federal Express, Hilton Hotels,
Gucci and the Mandarin Hotel group were each achieved via different
pathways.
Business School researchers such as Simon Tam, at Hong Kong University
Business School have argued there are only really seven distinct routes to
significant business success.
All hyper-growth firms surveyed appear to fit into one or other of these
categories.
All companies following one pathway might experience the same benefits, but
they also share the same vulnerabilities.
The seven routes are distinct, although they may exist in various
combinations, within large groups or over time. They are:
The Product Innovation Route: here the business is built on one or more
extremely successful, original and unique product. Polaroid and Sony are
examples. Products may be as varied as instant noodles to adult magazines,
but the companies succeed, after a long period, researching the unique,
innovative and, of course, highly desirable product.
The Technological Innovation Route: here business success lies not in
finding a new product, but rather a different way of producing it.
Honda added an engine to a bicycle and Evergreen thought of container ships.
Many have, sometimes through luck, discovered a new way to do things. And
they have become extremely rich in the process. The Relationship Route: all
business people know about contacts and networking, but few make it the
secret of their success. Khashoggi and Hammer, for example, both became
filthy rich by establishing and maintaining highly beneficial relationships
with politicians, the military, corporations and royalty.
They certainly believed that God gave us our friends and the devil out
relations.
Exploiting the Rigid Competitor Route: some firms have succeeded by spotting
not a gap in the market, but the lazy, inflexible rigid competitor.
Regulatory change and the opening of legal loopholes means that some
entrepreneurs have anticipated and used the opportunity.
Freddie Laker, Federal Express and DHL typify those who made their killing
by exploiting the complacency of others.
Turnround Route: some have made it rich by a dramatic and unpredicted
turnround of poorly functioning companies.
Individuals have taken weakly functioning organisations and changed then
into vigorous, customer-sensitive, dollar-generating companies. Hilton
Hotels and First Pacific nicely illustrate this. The Market Forces Route:
some people are, it seems, super-sensitive to consumers' psychology. Those
with the metaphorical ears to the ground of market forces have included
Gucci, Saatchi and Saatchi and Lotte.
These highly successful businessmen have capitalised, mobilised and
manipulated market forces to their own ends.
The Exceptional Service Route: There are those, such as Singapore Airlines
and the Mandarin Hotel chain whose success is almost entirely attributable
to going beyond currently conceivable levels of service.
The potential customer becomes a regular customer and a happy
free-advertiser by word-of-mouth for the company.
It is hard work but such companies are proof that it can be done and there
are rich pickings once the reputation for service has been won and the
prices can be marked.
The problem with all lists or category systems is that the hair-splitter
find unclassifiable or combination routes. Others, hoping for fame, devise
alternative classification systems. But rather than figure out a perfect and
parsimonious nomenclature for becoming rich, it may be better to begin the
journey.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Management: Rule by consensus - Kabi Pharmacia's chief
executive exemplifies the Swedish way / Euromanagers to Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS CAREER moves go, it could hardly have been better timed. In the four
years since Hakan Astrom joined Sweden's Kabi pharmaceuticals group, he has
shinned up the corporate ladder at the same time as the company has gone
through a dynamic period of expansion. Sales have grown 10 times since he
took the helm.
In 1989 he was worried the company was too small to survive. Today he sits
at the top of Europe's eighth largest pharmaceuticals group and one of the
world's top 20 - the jewel in the crown of the food and pharmaceuticals
group Procordia.
Astrom, 46, is nothing if not modest about his success. Of his elevation to
the post of chief executive in March 1992, he comments it was a fortuitous
reshuffle around him that brought him the top job.
'There was no-one left but me for Kabi Pharmacia,' he says. Colleagues say
the promotion was merited by his intelligence, in-depth knowledge of
pharmaceuticals and capacity for hard work.
His tendency towards self-deprecation is part of a manner that is low-key.
In conversation Astrom is soft-spoken, undemonstrative and easy-going. He is
not outwardly dynamic, comments a colleague, who adds that he is a far less
dominant figure within the company than Hakan Mogren, boss of Sweden's other
big pharmaceuticals company, Astra. Part of the reason is that Astrom works
in the shadow of Jan Ekberg, Procordia chief executive and a former boss of
Kabi.
But his manner sits well with a management style that emphasises teamwork
and consensus. Management is about getting the 'commitment and involvement'
of those around you, and not just giving orders, he stresses. 'You get the
best out of people if they have been involved in the decision-making process
and understand why a decision has been taken,' he maintains.
Consensus-style management is part of a Swedish tradition and culture. It is
a process that extends to the shop-floor through the extensive consultation
rights of trade unions.
Astrom does not criticise the process of union involvement. 'The unions have
the same objectives as management, which is to develop a good company. It is
a strength, particularly in periods of change, to know that unions are
supportive of a given strategy.' He notes that in other countries,
managements often use unions as an excuse for not doing things.
He goes further in suggesting that the management of a big international
pharmaceuticals group also needs the direct input of its specialists and
researchers. 'These groups expect to participate in the life of the company,
but they also have a lot of knowledge which has to be brought into the
management process,' he says.
But he admits that this can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Unions, for
example, are consulted at corporate, divisional and plant level, while
Astrom has a monthly meeting with union representatives.
'It's much easier to be a manager in a country where there is more emphasis
on giving orders because what you are saying is not really questioned. But
it doesn't mean you will reach the right decision. With the Swedish way, you
are more likely to have challenges if decisions are not right.'
Not everyone is so enthusiastic. As one foreign observer says: 'Swedes don't
like to take decisions individually, which can mean they are rather weak and
slow to make up their minds.'
Astrom does not accept this, and points to the current integration of Kabi
with the newly acquired Italian pharmaceutical group Farmitalia Carlo Erba
to make his point.
'This deal was only completed in May, and yet already we have moved very
quickly to get the new management teams in place in all the countries where
we will be operating. You can combine both speed and accuracy of decision
making with a management style of involvement and commitment,' he maintains.
Astrom confesses to being a workaholic - his working day can easily stretch
from 8am to 10pm - but he also finds time to pore over management books and
articles. One result of his reading has been a new emphasis on time-based
management, or a programme called TTM 50 which aims to cut delivery times to
market by 50 per cent.
Important as measures like this are, he believes there are dangers in
becoming too caught up in internal processes.
'It's very easy to get internally focused, but the key to management is to
maintain an external focus as well so that you don't lose sight of the
customer, the market and the competitive situation. It's important to
establish a strategic direction, so that everyone in the group is heading
towards the same goal.'
Though clearly a defender of Swedish management style, Astrom believes the
Swedes lose out in having a limited number of foreigners in senior
management positions, even in the country's big multinationals. It's not
surprising, he says, given Sweden's climate, high tax rates and generally
low pay levels by international standards. 'But it will have to change.
Sweden needs to become less insular,' he states.
New turmoil awaits Kabi in the autumn as Procordia - which is
part-state-owned and part owned by Volvo - is split into its food and
pharmaceutical segments as part of a resolution of an ownership dispute
between the two main shareholders. Volvo is to take over the food
operations, while what is left of Procordia will be vertically integrated
with its pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses. For Astrom it almost
certainly means he will be playing second fiddle again to Jan Ekberg, at
least in the short term, probably as one of several vice-presidents.
'It is a lesser role,' he says without a trace of wounded pride.
'On the other hand the company is much bigger now, and the challenges ahead
are tremendous.'
These challenges suggest he will remain with the group in the short-term, at
least until the Kabi and Farmitalia Carlo Erba integration is complete.
This will take several years and for the moment he is not looking beyond
that. 'You shape your career path by creating results. If you create
results, you will over time be rewarded,' he says.
This is one in an occasional series. Previous articles appeared on August 13
and July 19.

Alan Jones, 49, has joined Kalon, the paints group, as managing director of
the decorative paints division. Formerly he was managing director of Paul's
Food Group, which is the cereals part of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the
chemicals, timber and building supplies, food and agriculture, and
plantations group.
Before that, Jones had been managing director of Adams Foods; indeed Mike
Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, says that he has been a managing
director for 15 years.
Jones takes over the job, which involves the day-to-day running of the
division, from Hennessy himself, who therefore knew the kind of replacement
he was looking for. Hennessy says he had only interviewed about six people
and had been happy to wait until he had found the right candidate.
The appointment will free Hennessy, also 49 and a crucial influence on the
rapid growth of Kalon, to concentrate on his role of developing the group as
a whole. He is keen to push both the group's development in continental
Europe following the acquisition of Novodec in France and the expansion of
the new specialist products division in the UK.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Fall in VAT registrations highlights recession's toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday announced an unprecedented
net decrease in the number of businesses registered for value added tax last
year, indicating the recession's heavy toll among small businesses.
The stock of VAT registered businesses declined last year for the first time
since records began in 1979, according to DTI figures. It reported a net
decrease of 41,000 businesses, equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the stock
of 1.64m VAT registered businesses at the beginning of last year.
The department said there were 189,000 new registrations last year,
equivalent to 12 per cent of the stock of businesses at the start of the
year, and 230,000 deregistrations, amounting to 14 per cent of the stock.
While there were small net increases in the number of businesses in
wholesaling, finance, property and professional services, the number of VAT
registered businesses in construction fell by 21,000 or 9 per cent of that
sector.
There were small declines in the number of businesses in the agricultural,
transport, retail, catering and motor trades.
The number of businesses declined in all regions last year, except for
Northern Ireland.
The DTI stressed that its figures did not measure births and deaths of
businesses but indicated trends in the size of the small business
population.
Registration for VAT is mandatory when turnover reaches Pounds 37,600 a
year.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Tax rises will cost households 2% income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX increases announced in the spring Budget and last April's switch from
poll tax to council tax will cost households an average of 2 per cent of
annual income by the time they are fully introduced in 1995, the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies says.
Concluding that the combined measures will have a 'significant impact on
household living standards', Mr Christopher Giles and Mr Michael Ridge, IFS
research officers, say that income losses will total 0.5 per cent for the
bottom 10 per cent of households measured by income, while the top 10 per
cent will experience an aver-age drop of 2.65 per cent of income.
Writing in the latest issue of Fiscal Studies, an IFS publication, the two
researchers say the Budget tax increases planned for the period to April
1995 will lead to both rich and poor losing a significant share of their
income.
However, the replacement of the poll tax by the council tax will mitigate
the income losses of those with low standards of living.
Although public attention has focused on the government's plans to levy
value added tax on domestic fuel and power from next year, the researchers
point out that the VAT change will account for only 22 per cent of the total
Pounds 10.3bn increase in tax revenues which is planned by the government
for 1995-96.
The combined effect on income tax and National Insurance contributions will
be twice as important as the VAT change.
In a separate article the IFS says the government must take care to avoid
another poll tax-type fiasco as water companies shift from water rates to
alternative methods of charging households for water and sewerage services
by the end of this decade.
It points out that water charges have become a large and increasingly
conspicuous item for UK households in recent years.
The 1989 Water Act prohibits the use of rateable values - the basis of the
UK local property taxes before 1990 - for levying water charges after the
end of the century.
The switch to new systems will lead to 'significant numbers of households
experiencing gains or losses compared with the present system' and is likely
to amplify public awareness of water charges, the IFS says.
Local authorities in England collected 26 per cent of this year's expected
income from the council tax in the first three months after its
introduction, according to figures released yesterday by the Department of
the Environment.
The equivalent figure for the first year of the poll tax was only 16 per
cent.
Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, described them as a 'very good set
of results', and added that outstanding poll tax arrears had also been
reduced by 10 per cent during the same three months.
The Institute of Revenue, Rating and Valuation, whose members collect the
tax, said the news was encouraging, but added there was 'no room for
government complacency' because transitional relief for the council tax has
yet to be removed.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Farmers seek to save wages board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS and their employees are fighting to save the Agricultural Wages
Board, the only remaining statutory body to set minimum pay rates for
low-paid workers.
Their campaign has persuaded Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, to
extend the consultation period about the future of the board until November.
The deadline had been September. Mrs Shephard, as employment secretary this
year guided legislation through parliament to scrap wages councils next
month. The councils set minimum rates for 2.5m private-sector workers. But
the legislation does not cover the board, which is governed by agricultural
rather than employment regulations.
Farmers and farm workers believe the board is still relevant in an industry
where it is estimated that workers earn 76 per cent of the average male wage
and craftworkers have a minimum rate of Pounds 159 for a 39-hour week. Many
employers pay above minimum rates, but many farm workers nevertheless claim
income support.
Mr Paul Redgate, a national officer of the TGWU general union, which
absorbed the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers in 1982, said
free collective bargaining worked where there was a number of employees, but
most farms employed very few workers. 'It is difficult to take industrial
action against your boss who is probably working alongside you,' he said.
Mr Oliver Walston, who employs four men on his 2,000-acre farm in
Cambridgeshire and who is active in the National Farmers Union, said
'embarrassment' was a polite way of describing the anguish he would feel if
he had to negotiate with people he knew well.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Earlier release for economic statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL ECONOMIC statistics are to be released at 9.30am instead of 11.30am, the
Central Statistical Office announced yesterday.
The change, which takes place next week, was sought by the prime minister to
give the City and financial markets more time to digest the information, and
to stop the release of figures clashing with cabinet meetings.
Downing Street yesterday said that the prime minister had also argued for
the change partly to shorten the period when information was available
without being made public.
The move stemmed from a 'prime ministerial initiative that CSO were very
happy to go along with', Downing Street said. The change fitted in with the
prime minister's Citizen's Charter initiative and was 'good news for the
users of statistics'.
The CSO has already taken steps to limit access to sensitive information
ahead of release.
Statistics released by other departments, such as employment data, will
follow suit.
The new time of 9.30am is seen as a compromise between the markets, which
want information released as early as possible, and journalists and
government officials who are not in favour of an early start.
Next week's figures for new construction orders will be the first official
statistics to be released at the new time.
The old release time of 11.30am was already an improvement for the markets
on the previous time of 3.30pm.
One City analyst commented yesterday: 'This shows that the CSO is catching
up with the working day of the City, and the new release time is good news
for lunches.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SENSITIVE company tax information could fall into the 'wrong hands' under
government market-testing plans for parts of the Inland Revenue, Mr Clive
Brooke, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, warned
yesterday.
In a letter to 50 companies, he said Revenue files had never been penetrated
by industrial or commercial spies or by computer hackers.
Confidential tax information was known only to officers, who had never sold
nor exchanged any details. 'This may not be the case in future because the
government is set on privatising key parts of the Revenue,' said Mr Brooke.
The Revenue's computer division is about to be contracted out, and typing
and secretarial services are to be market tested with the possibility of
work going to private contractors.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Thames to launch satellite channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television yesterday announced the launch of a new satellite and
cable television channel, called UK Living, which will start broadcasting on
September 1, Gary Mead writes.
The move extends Thames' broadcasting alliance with two of the dominant
forces in cable communications, the US companies Cox Enterprises and
Tele-Communications (TCI).
UK Living is aimed primarily at women in the 25-45 age range in the middle
and lower socio-economic groups; there are about 3.8m women who fit that
profile in the UK. It will broadcast a mix of soap operas, chat shows,
dramas and films.
The bulk of the material will come from taking previously broadcast
programmes from BBC TV and Thames TV's extensive library. A unique feature
will be the broadcasting of BBC TV programmes within a week of their first
being transmitted on the BBC network.
The shareholders of the new channel plan to develop it alongside their
existing cable and satellite channel, UK Gold, which specialises in
broadcasting library material from Thames TV and the BBC.
UK Living has Pounds 25m in funding and a Pounds 2m launch marketing budget,
contributed by Thames, TCI and Cox.
Ms Lis Howell, formerly head of programming at the breakfast commercial
television company GMTV, is in charge of creating UK Living's schedule.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Councils spurn reforms: Lang fails to quell gerrymandering
storm over Scottish shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE organisation which represents councils in Scotland has told Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, that it will not reconsider its refusal to co-operate
with government plans to reshape local government.
Mr Charles Gray, convener of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities
(Cosla), has told Mr Lang: 'We are not prepared to help you make the best of
a bad job.'
Cosla strongly opposes the white paper on reorganising local government
which proposes creating 28 single-tier authorities to replace the nine
regional, three island and 53 district councils. The reform also involves
taking water services out of the hands of regional and island councils and
creating three water authorities.
Cosla has argued that the present two-tier structure should be maintained
and objects to the loss of council control of water services.
The Labour-dominated body is particularly angry about the proposed
boundaries for the new councils, drawn up without the setting up of a
commission of the kind operating in England. Mr Lang has been widely accused
of gerrymandering to create Conservative-controlled councils.
The gerrymandering charge has been levelled at the intended creation of
councils in South Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Stirling and Berwickshire &amp;
East Lothian which could have Conservative majorities. Critics have argued
that these councils would have smaller populations than adjoining
Labour-controlled authorities.
A recent System Three opinion poll showed support in Scotland for
single-tier councils at 29 per cent in July against 46 per cent in May.
Cosla is refusing to take part in discussions with the Scottish Office on
the details of the plan, which will form a bill in the next session of
parliament. It has urged member councils to boycott discussions.
So far Lothian and Grampian regions, which are Labour-controlled, have
banned discussion with the Scottish Office. Strathclyde region, the biggest
in Scotland, has told its officials not to take part in talks. Central and
Tayside regions are also likely to ban contact with the Scottish Office.
However, Highland region, which will survive after reorganisation while the
district councils under it disappear, has said it will continue talking to
the government. Borders region is strongly opposed to the proposal that it
should lose Berwickshire, but has nevertheless decided to keep talking to
the Scottish Office.
The boycott on discussions will make it more difficult for the Scottish
Office to complete its plans. On the other hand councils will find it more
difficult to influence the final shape of the legislation if they refuse to
discuss it.

price cuts for the 1994 season.
Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, launched its new brochure including
cuts worth Pounds 60m on next season's holidays. It said they would result

not say I would be happy with a price war, but you can't stay out of it.'
However, a director of another leading tour operator said yesterday that he
believed the price-cutting would be shortlived. 'It's a phoney war,' he
said. 'None of us could exist in a permanent state of discounting.'
The first shot in the pricing battle was fired on Monday, when travel agent
Thomas Cook announced a 10 per cent discount on prices of all holidays in
its 1994 brochure. That was immediately matched by Pickfords and Hogg
Robinson, and yesterday AT Mays, the UK's largest independent travel agent
chain, said it would offer 10 per cent discounts.
Lunn Poly, which is owned by Thomson, said it would also announce discounts
at the launch tomorrow of its new brochure. 'We will not be beaten for
price,' the company warned.
The biggest discounts are being offered to consumers who book early. Thomson
saw its market share in the lucrative pre-Christmas booking period dip
sharply for the 1993 season. This year it hopes to increase its share of the
pre-Christmas market from 33 per cent to 50 per cent.
'We expect the pre-Christmas market to grow from 1.5m to 2m holidays this
year, and Thomson wants the biggest share of that,' said Mr Newbold.
Thomson is forecasting a big increase in tourists travelling to mainland
Spain and the Balearic Islands. Overall, Thomson forecasts that the package
holiday market should return to its 1988 level of about 10m holidaymakers
against this year's 8.5m.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Hambros Bank to advise Tube
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground has appointed Hambros Bank as an adviser on raising
private-sector funding.
The move is a response to the private-finance initiative announced by Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in the Autumn Statement last year.
Hambros is to 'consider the feasibility of the private-sector funding
opportunities that the Underground and London Transport have already
identified', and 'suggest possible further opportunities for private-sector
involvement'.
Projects being examined for joint-venture possibilities include CrossRail,
the Pounds 2bn project to build a pair of rail tunnels between London's
Paddington and Liverpool Street stations, and the overdue modernisation of
the Northern Line.
London Underground denied that full-scale privatisation was an option, while
Hambros said that it was not part of its remit.
London Underground said: 'This is not a prelude to privatisation, but we
have major problems over funding our long-term investment plans, given that
the 1992 Autumn Statement reversed the promises made in the 1991 Autumn
Statement. This clearly placed upon us the need to explore every feasible
avenue.'
Mr Tony Sheppeck, a member of the London Underground board, said that the
aim was to create 'a decently modern metro within 10 years, reversing
decades of neglect'. He said this had gained 'tremendous support from
business and the community in London'.
The main priority of the new initiative is to raise funds for new trains and
signals, rather than opening new lines.
Mr James Stewart, of Hambros' asset finance division, said equipment supply
would provide one of the main routes for private-sector involvement in
London Underground.
Hambros already advises the Department of Transport on British Rail's West
Coast mainline, and works on several other projects involving health and
transport. It is one of several City institutions to devote heavy resources
to advising on public-sector projects.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Special agent licensed to listen and learn from industry:
The Bank of England official responsible for economic information-gathering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAN WATSON takes off his glasses, cocks his head, poses a meticulously
framed question and listens intently. It is a pose he repeats hundreds of
times a year in the course of gathering information about economic
conditions from top industrialists.
Mr Watson is the most senior of nine people employed by the Bank of England
throughout Britain to form contacts with the business world. The ideas they
come up with - from a network comprising some 3,600 companies - are fed each
month to the Bank's headquarters and shared with the Treasury. Mr Watson
acts as its 'regional agent' in north-west England, taking in Greater
Manchester, and parts of Lancashire, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Staffordshire.
The head of a 60-strong Bank branch in Manchester his main task is searching
for economic insights. He combines this with arranging contacts for
companies and providing a sympathetic ear to recession-hit executives.
Reports on the 20 or so companies Mr Watson visits each month are dictated
into a tape recorder as he drives between appointments. The reports form the
basis for his seven-page study of economic conditions in the north-west sent
monthly to Mr Mike Smith, the Bank official in London who co-ordinates the
regional agents' work.
Mr Smith translates the prose of Mr Watson and the other agents into a
five-page, confidential 'national summary' of UK business conditions.
Together with the latest economic statistics and evidence from business
surveys, the summary is fed to a small group of Bank and Treasury officials
for briefing Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on economic developments.
With the government having been wrongfooted on several occasions during the
recession about the speed of recovery, the Bank and Treasury are examining
the regional reports increasingly closely for clues as to how close Britain
is getting to sustainable growth. The Treasury, while stopping short of
establishing as wide ranging a set of company contacts as the Bank, is
trying to learn more about conditions in industry, mainly through a series
of company visits for top officials.
Much of Mr Watson's time is taken by visits to companies and lunches and
dinners with industrialists. Through such contacts he believes he finds out
about nearly all the important events at the 400 or so companies with which
he is in contact.
Mr Watson has no formal training as an economist, spending most of his
Threadneedle Street career in departments dealing with banking and
management training. But in discussions he turns his hand to conveying the
formal Bank views about such things as how much inflation is working through
the economy.
The general conclusion from his recent visits to companies - and supported
by the monthly reports from the other eight Bank agents - is that a fragile
recovery has started. Yet it could be stifled by events such as further
economic contraction in continental Europe.
A broad assessment is given by Mr Peter Foden, chairman of the
Cheshire-based ERF truckmaker: 'The economy is healthier than it was, but
it's a long way from going mad.'
Mr Watson has to work hard at keeping the confidence of the companies he
talks to. The reports he sends to the Bank's head office do not discuss
individual companies by name.
'I try to probe but not embarrass,' he says.
Mr Watson's general knowledge about the region - and his links with
commercial banking and the Treasury - are appreciated by contacts such as Mr
Peter Jones, chairman of the Emerson housebuilding group in Alderley Edge,
Cheshire. 'I use Alan as a sounding board,' says Mr Jones.
Another fan is Mr John Waldron, chairman of Kratos, a Manchester-based maker
of scientific instruments.
'He's plugged into the (business) network in the north-west and speaks his
mind clearly.'

FT  18 AUG 93 / Leasing trade seeks car register
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE in the law to weaken the right of finance companies to reclaim cars
bought innocently when they are still subject to hire purchase or leasing
agreements is being sought by the finance and leasing industry itself.
Its trade organisation, the Finance and Leasing Association, has presented
proposals for the government to set up a vehicle ownership register, which
would be complementary to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at
Swansea. The register would be based on the manufacturer's vehicle
identification number, which the association insists is a much more reliable
identifier than the registration number.
Any finance company which did not register its interest in a vehicle would
lose its ownership right to it in the event of a subsequent unauthorised
sale to an unsuspecting third party.
On the register would be details of ownership, mileage records, reports of
theft and insurance write-offs.
The proposals coincide with publication of an association survey of members
in the motor finance sector indicating a total of 7,500 cases of theft and
fraud related to such vehicles over the past year. Mr John Brown,
association chairman, said it was likely that the reported figures 'are just
the tip of the iceberg'.
Under the association's scheme potential purchasers would be able to gain
access to information on any car by phoning the register and on payment of a
small fee. The association also wants the law changed to require
manufacturers to register all new cars under the same system.
The proposals received support from the Retail Motor Industry Federation,
which represents the retail motor trade. It said that such changes to the
law 'are long overdue and will do a great deal to reduce road
vehicle-related fraud'.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Pension fund manager reprimanded by Imro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PYRFORD International, the pension fund manager for Courage, the brewer, has
been fined Pounds 30,000 and reprimanded by Imro, the self-regulatory body
for the pension fund management industry, it was disclosed yesterday.
This follows an official complaint made to Imro in May last year by the TGWU
general union over the operation of the Courage brewery employees' pension
fund.
The fund was forced to write off a Pounds 10m investment in Harlin Holdings
 -later called International Brewing Holdings - which owns 38 per cent of
Foster's Brewing Group, Courage's Australian owner since 1986.
Imro found that Pyrford had committed eight breaches of rules.
Two of the findings related to certain investments where the company had
given the trustees of the pension fund 'no warning of the fact that it
considered the investments to be not readily realisable and that it may not
be possible to establish the current value of the investments'.
It also found that the company, between May 1990 and March 1993, 'failed to
establish and maintain adequate systems for the control of accounting
records and for the conduct of permitted business'.
It also pointed to omissions of details of management charges in statements
to the trustees, and to lack of effective arrangements for ensuring
compliance with the regulatory rules.
Imro said it could not comment on its judgment.
Mr Brian Revell, the union's national official for the food and drink
industry, said: 'The Imro decision completely vindicates our complaint. This
case shows clearly that workers' pensions are not safe when left totally in
the employers' hands.'
He went on: 'Employees' pension contributions are not some private
investment fund for their bosses.
'The Courage case highlights the need for honest and open dealings with
pension funds, which are no more or less than our members' deferred
earnings.'
Mr Revell said Courage had shown 'misplaced confidence in their fund
managers' and this demonstrated 'the need for genuine and powerful worker
participation through their unions in the control of pension funds'.
Pyrford International was formed by the managers of Elders Investment
Management in early 1991 in a buy-out from Foster's, then known as Elders
IXL.
When the TGWU lodged its complaint with Imro, Courage said that since the
write-off in 1990-91 the trustees had decided to invest no further money in
companies related to Courage and Foster's.
Neither Pyrford nor Courage could be contacted for comment last night.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Minister unveils M6 widening plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government expects to spend Pounds 570m widening 57 miles of the M6
motorway between Birmingham and Manchester.
Mr Robert Key, roads minister, yesterday announced the government's detailed
plans for easing congestion on one of the UK's busiest motorways.
He immediately ran into charges from Friends of the Earth, the environmental
group, that the widening would create more traffic problems.
Speaking in Knutsford, Cheshire, Mr Key said that the government would
publish next year the draft statutory orders for the road. But he was vague
about when work would start, other than saying 'the mid-1990s' and 'within a
few years'.
He added: 'My ambition is that it should be open by the time of the
Manchester Olympics.' The city is bidding to hold the Olympic Games in the
year 2000. So far the government has made no budgetary provision for the
motorway work.
The plan is to widen the motorway from three lanes to four lanes in each
direction. At present the M6 carries 90,000 vehicles a day (including 25,000
heavy trucks) through Staffordshire and Cheshire. The Department of
Transport expects the widened motorway to carry 120,000 vehicles a day by
the year 2015.
The plan is complementary to proposals for privately run toll motorways
around the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. The southernmost point of
the widened M6 would be at the junction with the orbital roads.
Construction work on the M6 would be on land next to the existing
carriageway, allowing traffic to move during the work. This technique,
called parallel widening, has been used to enlarge the M5 near Worcester.
Friends of the Earth, a consistent opponent of the government's
road-building programme, warned the Department of Transport that the worst
congestion problems were in the cities. 'Unless we deal with these,
expanding the motorway network will encourage further traffic growth in
congested bottlenecks like Birmingham and Manchester,' it said.

THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission is due to hand its report on perfume
prices to the Department of Trade and Industry today.
The Office of Fair Trading asked the commission to investigate nine months
ago after complaints that leading fragrance houses were maintaining prices
at an artificially high level. The Superdrug chain, which had been cutting
as much as 30 per cent off recommended retail prices, complained to the OFT
that fragrance manufacturers were refusing to supply stores.
Officials at the department are expected to consider the report for three to
four weeks before publishing its findings and deciding whether any trading
rules have been violated.
Superdrug was supported in its complaints by Asda and Littlewoods.

FRESHLY-SQUEEZED orange juice was yesterday exempted from value added tax,
Andrew Jack writes.
Orange juice that has only been pasteurised is not a 'manufactured beverage'
and can therefore be zero-rated, a VAT tribunal ruled.
Customs and Excise, in an appeal case brought by Tropicana, argued that VAT
should be charged
Following the defeat, Customs said it would take the case to the High Court.
It said the ruling contradicted a VAT tribunal decision against Sunjuice
that the product should be standard-rated.
Customs said yesterday that traders could temporarily zero-rate orange juice

FT  18 AUG 93 / Business aims to find a common purpose in Belfast: A charity
that runs an initiative to break down city barriers has taken up the
challenge of Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHARITY Common Purpose aims to find solutions to social problems in
cities. It brings together decision-makers from the public, private and
voluntary sectors, and declares in its promotional material that there is
'almost no limit to what can be achieved within a city when its key people
from every sector . . . work together'.
It is a bold claim and, after testing it in 17 mainland cities since the
charity was launched in 1989, Common Purpose has this year taken its message
to Belfast.
Organisations seeking to break down barriers between the communities in
Northern Ireland risk accusations of presumptuousness or naivety. 'Working
together' and 'common purpose' are far from obvious descriptions of many
aspects of life in the province. But the request for Common Purpose to bring
its initiative to Belfast came from within the city, and is supported by
business and voluntary sector leaders.
Common Purpose draws recruits from among those who are rising to the top of
organisations, operating through discussion sessions and a series of visits
and study programmes covering education, health, crime and other social
issues. Participants in the first year's programme in Belfast come from
organisations including Ulster Bank, Boots, Royal Mail, Shelter, Ulster
University, the city council and the probation board.
Common Purpose's Belfast programme is its standard one - it does not contain
overt sessions on sectarianism - but local promoters of the initiative were
determined controversial issues must not be avoided.
'If we failed to consider the divisions within the community the whole thing
would be a waste of time,' says Mr George McGrath, British
Telecommunication's deputy chief executive in Northern Ireland and chairman
of Belfast Common Purpose. 'We were satisfied that these issues would come
out as part of the natural examination of aspects of Belfast life.
'It would hardly be possible to discuss crime and punishment, or send the
Common Purpose team out with a police or army patrol, without considering
the issues that cause division in our society.'
Ms Louise Ward Hunter, Common Purpose project leader in Belfast, says early
experience indicates that the scheme is avoiding the danger of the exchange
of views becoming no more than a repetition of familiar partisan slogans, or
generating an artificially polite atmosphere in which straight-talking was
avoided.
This is supported by evidence from the other efforts to break barriers being
made by business and voluntary sectors in the province
Mr George Mackey, chief executive of Laganside Development Corporation and
an active supporter of Common Purpose's move into Belfast, is also chairman
of Business in the Community in Northern Ireland. BITC is trying to
strengthen business-community links in a province where sectarian divisions
are not the only problem - unemployment at 14.4 per cent is the highest in
the UK and an estimated 95,000 children live at or below poverty levels.
BITC's Seeing is Believing programme, like Common Purpose, brings business
leaders into contact with aspects of life that do not appear on their
regular agendas. There are, for example, 400 people serving life sentences
in Northern Ireland due for release relatively soon, and a BITC team has
been set up to help handle the training and employment aspects of their
re-entry into society.
Mr Mackey says the reaction of some business leaders during prison visits
associated with the initiative has been a 'mixture of voyeurism and shock'.
Like Common Purpose, the programme was not set up to promote discussion on
violence, crime and punishment in the Northern Ireland context, but has
succeeded in doing so.
Ms Julia Middleton, founder of Common Purpose, decided to take the scheme to
the province after being approached by Mr Quintin Oliver, director of the
Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action. She is convinced that the
popularity and speedy acceptance of the scheme in mainland Britain - 1,500
people with an average age of 38 have already taken part and pilots are
planned in France and Germany next year - should ensure that it will
withstand the potential difficulties of its introduction in Northern
Ireland.
Mr Oliver regards such voluntary-sector initiatives as uniquely important in
the province. 'A combination of direct rule, the poor reputation of local
government and a remote Civil Service with extensive decisionmaking powers
denies people the opportunities for grassroots political activity that are
available elsewhere,' he says. 'So charities and voluntary organisations
have a particularly vital role.'

FT  18 AUG 93 / Audit rap for housing associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING associations must improve their financial and management controls if
they are to deal with the extra private-sector funds planned for them by the
government, a report by the National Audit Office warns today.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general, also recommends extra
powers for the Housing Corporation, which distributes government grants to
the associations.
The government intends to reduce the proportion of housing association
funding which comes from government grants from 75 per cent to 55 per cent
by 1995-96. Between now and 1995-96 an estimated Pounds 2.5bn of private
finance is needed to support forecast investment by the corporation of
Pounds 5.4bn.
Sir John says this exposes the associations to greater financial risk and
questions whether sufficient controls are in place for associations to deal
with the higher borrowing requirements which will follow these grant cuts.
He says the borrowing requirements will 'place associations' financial
management systems, practices and skills under substantially greater
pressure than has been experienced so far', while 'vigorous efforts will be
required to carry forward work on enhancing their oversight and monitoring'.
Sir John also warns: 'The willingness of the private sector to meet
associations' borrowing requirements has yet to be tested at the level
required to meet planned levels of development over the next few years.'
The report, based on a detailed study of 14 associations, makes several
criticisms of their management:
Some managing committees must be strengthened. The audit office found that
six associations had had difficulty recruiting members with the necessary
expertise, particularly in the area of finance. On average, 37 per cent of
committee members were over retirement age, and in one case this figure was
69 per cent. The pay of committee members and staff is limited by law.
Internal audits must be increased. Only six of the 14 associations studied
had been visited by internal auditors, and the corporation has no national
data on how effectively internal audits have been implemented. Most of the
associations without internal audit managed a 'significant' number of
housing units (from 1,350 to 5,600), and two had been advised by the
corporation in 1988-89 to start an internal audit.
External audits often fail to receive a sufficiently swift response from
associations - in one case the auditors raised the same observation in
successive years.
Borrowing strategies are inadequate in some cases. The report found few
associations had made 'long-term assessments of the availability of adequate
security for their proposed long-term borrowings'.
The audit office also found formal inquiries into associations by the
corporation were 'exhaustive and time-consuming'. It suggests the
corporation should be allowed to intervene before completing an inquiry, and
should publish research into using inter-association comparisons as
performance indicators.
The corporation has no power to vet the accounts of associations'
unregistered subsidiaries even though its 1991 survey found 30 associations
facing potentially serious financial difficulties because of investments in
subsidiaries ranging from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 12m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tony Allen is resigning as chief executive of Berkshire County Council at
the end of November.
The council, which during his tenure has pioneered contracting-out of
services to the private sector, now intends to devolve power further. It
plans to allow more autonomy to the people who chair committees and to
replace the office of chief executive, with a 'corporate manager'. The
council, jointly controlled by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, said this
was 'one of the most radical reorganisations in local government'.
Mr Allen is believed to disagree with some of the plans.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Nurses strike at London hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 40 nurses staged a one-day strike yesterday in protest at plans
they claim could close London's busiest casualty unit.
The dispute at University College Hospital centres on the government's
healthcare reforms and growing fears that the local health authority will
take away the hospital's funding.
Camden and Islington Health Authority plans to withdraw its service
contracts from UCH and the Middlesex Hospital as a result of the new
internal healthcare market. Unison, the public services union which
represents the nurses, claims that this would close both hospitals.
Mr Chris Hart, London health officer for Unison, said the strike was 'a
great success.' UCH denied it had caused problems.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Tories to set up anti-EC forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics are to set up a fully fledged secretariat as the next
stage in their struggle to shape the government's European policy to their
liking.
The decision reflects their determination to continue campaigning on
European issues even though Britain has now ratified the Maastricht treaty.
Well-marshalled Euro-sceptic opposition to Maastricht in parliament last
month forced Mr John Major, the prime minister, to stake his government's
future on a confidence motion after a humiliating defeat over the treaty's
social chapter.
The new body, which is expected to be known as the European Foundation, will
pick up the baton from the group assembled by Mr Bill Cash, the leading
Euro-sceptic Tory MP for Stafford, primarily to try to block Maastricht.
It is likely to concentrate on utilising and making more widely available
the welter of EC-related data the anti-Maastricht campaign has collected. To
do this it is expected to employ a small number of full-time staff.
Since the Maastricht Bill gained Royal assent, the Euro-sceptic camp has
been keen to emphasise that its campaign would include continuing to take a
stand on fresh Europe-related legislation.
A new flashpoint has already been threatened when the government brings
forward a bill on EC finance in November.
The proposed legislation will implement the agreement which was reached at
the Edinburgh summit increasing national governments' contributions to the
European Commission. Although ministers have described it positively, they
have conceded it will probably be opposed by some hardcore Tory rebels.
Senior ministers headed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, have
attempted to heal Tory wounds over Europe before elections to the European
Parliament next June.
The Conservative European election manifesto is expected to concentrate on
policy areas about which there is consensus within the party.
The Euro-sceptic operation will probably shift headquarters from its elegant
Westminster town house later this year.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Consumers 'will face
price rises' - Industry reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER organisations warned yesterday that gas bills would rise next year
if the recommendations in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission reports were
implemented.
Independent gas companies criticised the MMC's suggested timetable for
reform as too slow.
Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumer's Council, said: 'If these
recommendations are implemented it appears that large numbers of domestic
consumers will pay more for their gas. The reports were expected to remove
much of the uncertainty - that it certainly has not achieved.'
The National Consumer Council said that the government had not carried out
any detailed analysis of costs and benefits to consumers. 'This does not
bode well for prices and standards of service in the long term, over which
no controls are envisaged.'
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said the reports offered
nothing for the consumer and added: 'The cost of loosening British Gas's
stranglehold on the gas supply system will be paid through dearer gas bills
if present price controls are relaxed.'
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat energy and environment spokesman, said
that greater competition in the gas industry should be accompanied by an
increasingly strict regulatory process, guarantees of no discrimination over
the category of customer, and no risk of an increase in domestic customers'
gas bills.
Utilicorp UK, which has gas joint ventures with five electricity companies,
said the commission had taken the minimum steps necessary to introduce
competition into the domestic market.
The reports 'posed no real threat to British Gas's monopoly for five years,'
said Mr Roger Turner, Utilicorp's managing director. 'This report is a
gesture as far as the consumer is concerned. There is a danger that nine out
of 10 consumers will never enjoy the benefits of cheaper prices through
competition.'
Mr Malcolm Faulkner, marketing director of the Norweb electricity
distributor which has a gas joint venture with Utilicorp, said that, while
the report's conclusions were welcome, 'it seems to be all jam tomorrow. We
would like to see it more in line with the electricity market which will be
fully opened up by 1998.'
Mr Faulkner welcomed the recommendation that British Gas divest its supply
arm and said that he hoped it would lead to a further splitting up of the
gas distribution company to enable meter reading to be performed
independently.
'There could be a licensed meter operator,' he said. This opened up
economies of scale possibilities between gas and electricity meter reading.
However Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, an independent gas
company, said the regulatory authorities should look carefully into whether
regional electricity companies should be allowed to supply gas in their
areas.
'They would constitute a serious threat to competition. They could
cross-subsidise between their regulated electricity businesses and their
unregulated gas businesses.'
Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas director-general, welcomed the reports even though
they rejected his suggestion of breaking British Gas into 12 regional
companies and introduced liberalisation at a slower rate than he wanted.
'The recommendations will put gas customers on the same footing as
electricity customers in opening up the market to competition with all the
benefits that will bring, he said.
Ofgas dismissed suggestions that breaking up the British gas monopoly would
lead to price rises for small users. With proper safeguards, this need not
happen, it said.
Sir James said his next tasks included regulating relations between the
separated businesses which are to be created within British Gas, and setting
new terms for the transportation and storage of gas.
'Progress on these should not be affected by decisions on the ultimate
ownership of the different businesses.'
Mr Dave Stirzaker, leader of 32,000 gas workers in the Unison union, said
implementing the recommendations would mean the loss of at least 20,000 jobs
in companies which supply contracts or services to British Gas, as well as
the 20,000 jobs in British Gas itself.
Mr Donald Macgregor of the GMB general union said the report's
recommendations did not reflect customers' demands for a good and safe
service or the high level of skills needed for the job.
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said the recommendations
should allow the company to plan ahead with greater certainty.
Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said it should be in the interest of
the company's shareholders to split the supply business from transportation,
provided an appropriate financial and regulatory framework for the process
could be found.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Measures aim to end
threat of dominant market role - Commission's proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in two separate reports, concentrated
on the potential threat to customers and competitors of the dominant market
position held by British Gas.
One report will go to the secretary of state for industry, the other to Sir
James McKinnon, director-general of Gas Supply (Ofgas).
The commission also examined the way the company calculates its prices, and
recommended several changes to formulae used by British Gas to measure price
movements.
Its principal recommendation was that the company - the country's largest
gas supplier as well as its biggest seller of gas services - should divest
itself of its trading activities by March 31 1997.
This would leave the company to concentrate on gas transportation and
storage using its 250,000km national pipeline network to sell gas to a new
generation of independent suppliers.
The commission concluded that the dual role of British Gas as a seller and
owner of gas might be 'expected to reduce the effectiveness of competition
in supply of gas . . . inhibiting choice, restricting innovation and leading
to higher levels of gas prices'.
It said that the longest independently operated pipeline, known by the
commission, was just 50km. Competitors, therefore, were almost completely
dependent on the company's transportation and storage facilities and so
vulnerable to prices and conditions imposed by British Gas.
It said the sale of the company's trading activities, in its view, would not
put at risk security of gas supply or safety.
The reports concluded: 'Although some increase in costs in the short term
may result, the development of self-sustaining competition would bring
significant benefits to users.'
The MMC proposed two big changes to formulae used to determine prices. These
recommendations, if approved by Ofgas, would mean higher prices for many
domestic customers.
One proposal would mean that the next price change - due on April 1 next
year - for customers consuming 2,500 therms a year or less would be based on
the annual rise in the retail price index less 4 percentage points. This
compares with the present arrangement of price changes of RPI less 5
percentage points. The average household uses about 600 therms a year, so
most domestic customers will be affected.
The commission has also recommended changes to the formula used to calculate
prices charged to competitors using British Gas's pipelines.
This formula is based on a rate of return determined by Ofgas which British
Gas is allowed to earn from its pipeline business. The commission has
rejected claims from British Gas that the rate of return be lifted to 6.7
per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Instead the
commission concluded that the company should earn between 4 per cent and 4.5
per cent on existing assets and between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent on new
investment.
This compares with the rate of return previously allowed by Ofgas on
existing assets of 4.5 per cent.
The commission said that previous attempts to encourage competition had been
only partially successful. About one third of all non-tariff customers at
industrial and commercial premises using more than 25,000 therms a year were
currently supplied by independent companies, according to British Gas. This
compared with just 5 per cent in 1991.
Recent attempts to encourage greater competition for non-tariff business
customers between 2,500 and 25,000 therms, however, had been unsuccessful.
Also, customers served by independents were almost entirely contracted to
buy continuous gas supplies while so-called interruptible supplies, under
which gas availability can be restricted at peak demand, were almost
exclusively provided by British Gas.
British Gas also retained a monopoly on tariff customers using 2,500 therms
a year, most of them domestic customers charged under the formula calculated
by Ofgas.
The removal of the company's tariff monopoly, which the government has
announced is likely to abolished, would be beneficial to users, said the
commission. It recommended as an interim measure that the threshold for
tariff customers be reduced from 1997 from 2,500 therms to 1,500 therms a
year.
It also recommended that the non-tariff market share of British Gas over
2,500 therms a year, excluding gas for power generation, chemical feedstocks
or natural gas vehicles, be restricted to 55 per cent until the
transportation and trading can be separated.
British Gas had previously agreed to reduce its market share in this part of
the market to 40 per cent by 1995.
The commission said that increased competition had been beneficial in
driving down costs, with the average revenue per therm from contract gas
sales by British Gas falling by more than 30 per cent in real terms since
1986-87.
This was mainly due to lower prices for North Sea gas, but also to reduced
margins. In spite of this there were 'still complaints by some users that
gas prices are higher than for their European competitors'.
The commission noted: 'In the USA there is a high degree of competition
between interstate pipeline operators, who have also been under pressure to
withdraw from the sale of gas to end users.'
The MMC rejected a proposal by British Gas that it be allowed to retain
common ownership of separately established transportation and trading
businesses. The commission also disagreed with the company's view that
'competition was now self-sustaining and that the rapid growth of
competition showed that barriers of entry to the market were now
negligible'.
It said that the viability of competitors of British Gas depended on
gas-selling prices, which could be influenced by the large market share of
their biggest rival, and by gas transportation costs which were determined
directly by British Gas.
The recommendation that the company divest itself of its trading activities
would require changes to the Gas Act, the commission said. Until that could
be achieved the company's non-tariff activities should remain subject to
price schedules and to market share limits.
A date for removal of the tariff monopoly would 'depend on the progress of
legislative change so as to impose obligations for safety and security of
supply and social obligations on all competitors in the domestic market,'
the commission said.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Call for body to monitor
watchdogs - Regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas yesterday called on the government to reconsider urgently
establishing a body to regulate the privatised industry regulators.
Its call followed the rejection by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of
a request by British Gas and others for the commission to examine the
overall system of regulation. According to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive
of British Gas, the commission concluded that its terms of reference were
inappropriate to a wider assessment of the way regulatory affairs are
conducted.
British Gas made a number of criticisms of the regulation system to the
commission. They included: instability and uncertainty in the system;
overlap between the Office of Fair Trading, the Department of Trade and
Industry and Ofgas; inadequate procedures for the management of regulation;
and the public perception of an acrimonious relationship between Ofgas and
British Gas.
The commission, in its report on the Fair Trading Act reference, confirms
that it was asked to consider a number of detailed changes to the regulatory
system set up by the 1986 Gas Act that were outside its remit. 'Any findings
which we were to make relating to the (gas) industry would inevitably be
considered as having relevance to other regulated industries,' it says.
Such issues raise considerations of such importance, it adds, that if they
are to be considered 'they should be dealt with in the context of suitably
broad terms of reference which would allow a relevant body to consider them
as they applied to all regulators and not simply a single example'. It is
not clear whether the commission feels it would be the right body to carry
out this role, or even whether it believes such a change is necessary at
this stage.
Yesterday it declined to expand on the view expressed in the report. But in
an interview with the Financial Times last week, Mr Graeme Odgers, the new
chairman of the commission, indicated he was not convinced of the need for
change in the regulatory framework.
He said: 'Because the privatisation process as a whole has been so
successful, the government should think very carefully before making any
substantial changes to the regulatory regime.'
The disappointment of British Gas and others at the commission's failure to
investigate the regulatory system appears to stem from confusion about its
role. But it was 'not right to think of the MMC as regulator of the
regulators.'
The UK system of regulation, including the regulation of competition,
involves a separation of the roles of investigator, prosecutor and
adjudicator, which Mr Odgers is keen to preserve. The commission's role is
to act as adjudicator. Regulating the regulators would involve it in a
prosecuting role.
The commission's rejection of British Gas's request for an examination of
the regulatory system should not be interpreted as reluctance to carry out
privatisation inquiries in future. Mr Odgers confirmed last week that the
commission was happy to continue to handle them.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Gas chief defends
decision over MMC inquiry - The Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday
delivered its far-reaching report on the future of the UK gas industry. The
report took a year to prepare and recommends a plan to take the industry
into the 21st century. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
will decide whether to implement the recommendations

MR CEDRIC BROWN, chief executive of British Gas, was convinced yesterday
that his decision to submit the company to a wide-ranging inquiry by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission was the right one, in spite of the
commission's proposal that British Gas sell off its trading activities.
Mr Brown said: 'We now have the MMC setting out a framework for the next 10
years. A year ago we didn't know what would happen in the next six months
and we had no way to develop and plan our business.'
Mr Brown will be involved in intense negotiations with the government in
coming months. He will try to persuade Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, to adopt all the recommendations in the report and not
to proceed with a piecemeal implementation of the plan.
'I hope we don't have a quick-fix job cobbled together without keeping the
framework in place,' he said.
British Gas does not believe it is necessary to split up the company in
order to encourage the development of further competition. But Mr Brown
regards the commission's proposals for selling its trading arm as the best
option for its shareholders under the circumstances.
The commission differs from the industry regulator, Ofgas, on who should pay
for the divestment.
The cost of selling pipelines - arising from loss of economies of scale and
duplication of certain functions - will be about Pounds 130m, Pounds 80m a
year more than the company's current plans for separating its transport and
trading divisions.
The commission recommended that consumers bear this cost because the
development of competition would benefit them in the long run. British Gas
believes shareholders should not carry the cost of splitting up the company.
However, Ofgas says shareholders who have benefited from higher prices under
British Gas's monopoly should pay for divestment.
These details will be hammered out between the regulator, British Gas and
the government. Mr Heseltine could shy away from suggestions that household
customers pay for introducing competition as politically unpalatable.
British Gas has warned of higher prices for some customers - particularly
those using less gas - in a more competitive market. The company says a
separate pipelines company could have to charge customers living farthest
away from gas terminals more for their supply.
Ofgas calls these fears 'alarmist'. Mr Greg McGregor, director of
competition and tariffs, said he believed price rises to household customers
could be minimised. 'It is complete nonsense for British Gas to conjure up
the image of cross-subsidies in the system and maintain that smaller users
will end up paying more than large users.'
The commission has recommended adjusting the formula governing domestic
prices from next year so that consumers' gas prices should fall more slowly
than would have been the case. This will give British Gas additional
revenues of Pounds 300m from 1994 to 1997 before more competition is
introduced.
Competition will be introduced in phases. The commission recommended that
competition be extended to customers using more than 1,500 therms a year on
March 31 1997. The limit is currently 2,500 therms. This change will add a
further 500,000 customers to the competitive market - 100,000 industrial and
commercial consumers and 400,000 domestic.
The commission also recognised that British Gas's trading arm may have to
raise its prices when it is sold, in order to make a profit. This has
angered consumer groups which say households will pay the cost of transition
in the industry.
The commission, however, did not embrace British Gas's claims for a much
higher rate of return on its pipelines network. This is the formula that
governs the charges British Gas can levy on its rivals which use the system
for sending their own gas to industrial customers.
The commission proposed that British Gas's rate of return be 4 per cent to
4.5 per cent for existing assets - slightly lower than at present - and
between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent for new investment.
But British Gas's competitors and consumer groups would like to see the
speedier introduction of competition for households. Ofgas agrees, and
believes that the government should aim to free gas supply in line with the
electricity industry, which will be opened to full competition in 1998.
The government's own date for opening up the market had been set for 1996
before the commission inquiry. Some competitors would also like to see
British Gas's monopoly reduced more quickly than the commission has
proposed.
At least 30 companies - including many of the regional electricity companies
which have set up gas trading arms - had been gearing up to move into
household supply.
But British Gas says important issues have to be addressed before
competition can be introduced, such as safety in the system and social
obligations of the gas suppliers.
Mr Brown said he would have liked the commission to have provided answers to
all the questions about opening up the market. 'There are a whole range of
major issues that need to be resolved, but a whole raft of them await
political decisions which may not be as clear-cut as this report,' he said.
The changes proposed by the commission - particularly the sale of the
company's trading arm and the abolition of its monopoly - would require
legislation.
Mr McGregor said the report was designed cleverly to work on two levels if
the government decided not to go ahead with its full implementation. 'The
internal re-organisation of British Gas prior to the sale of its trading
activities could stand on its own independent of any decision on
divestment,' he said.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications
operator, has secured a Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) five-year contract to
provide data and managed network services across Europe for Worldspan Travel
Information Services.
Worldspan, owned by TWA, Delta and Northwest Airlines of the US, and Abacus,
a Singapore-based computer reservations company, is a leading provider of
automated airline ticket reservation systems.
Under the deal, a new network will interconnect Worldspan's European
locations, and will be managed by AT&amp;T Istel, AT&amp;T's European-based network
and information services provider.
The contract is one of the largest in Europe for managing a single company's
data network services.
Worldspan said it was a step towards creating a global data network for its
international operations.
Based in Atlanta, Worldspan provides more than 12,000 travel agencies
worldwide with access to reservations systems of airlines and others.
Earlier this year it signed a separate Dollars 100m contract with AT&amp;T to
consolidate its US-based travel agency customers and offices on to a single
nationwide network.

FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Caribbean pact with Cuba draws US fire - A
look at the regional repercussions of plans for trade and technical
co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL Central American states have stepped into a simmering diplomatic
dispute between the US and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) over a recent
trade and technical co-operation agreement between the community and Cuba.
Amid indications of increasing US concern over the agreement, Central
American diplomats in Washington told US congressmen their governments
opposed the pact. They fear the region could suffer from any action taken by
the US against the Caribbean countries.
Earlier this month a US House of Representatives foreign affairs
subcommittee sent a letter to the governments of the 13 members of Caricom
condemning the Cuban agreement. It said that the pact could have adverse
implications for future trade agreements between the Caribbean and the US,
and that Caricom should rescind its decision.
The US government says the agreement does not oblige Cuba to improve its
human rights record or move towards democratic government.
But leaders of Caricom - set up in 1973 and consisting of English-speaking
countries in the Caribbean basin, Belize in Central America and Guyana in
South America - have rejected the US criticism. They say the agreement is
part of a programme to improve relations with all countries in the region,
and that they have not asked other countries with which they have concluded
similar pacts for commitments on human rights and democracy.
Discontent in Washington has been fuelled by revelations that the draft of
the agreement setting up a joint commission between Caricom and Cuba did
contain references to human rights and democracy.
The scheduled signing of the pact in Havana in April was aborted when Cubans
objected to the 'political' nature of the draft. But at the annual summit in
the Bahamas last month, Caricom's leaders agreed to the changes.
'Clearly we are disappointed that the agreement signed by Caricom with Cuba
did not include any human rights or democracy conditions,' Ms Donna Hrinak,
deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs in the US
State Department, said in a radio interview.
'I think it is particularly unfortunate as it is coming from Caribbean
countries which have their own, very strong democratic traditions, and which
have been supporting efforts to restore democracy in Haiti.'
While some Caricom leaders, including Mr P J Patterson, the Jamaican prime
minister, say that they understand the reaction, they are not moved by it.
'I think there are particular groups in the US which will have reservations,
but we have to decide on our own affairs,' Mr Patterson said. 'The cold war
is over. Countries in Europe are negotiating with Cuba. It is appropriate
for us to have agreements with Cuba in the framework of a joint commission.'
The community represents a market of 5.5m people and is attempting to create
a customs union and a common market by next year. The setting up of the
joint commission with Cuba to oversee co-operation in several areas follows
several years of Cuban efforts - with little reward - to improve relations
with its neighbours.
The commission is aimed at increasing the volume of trade between Cuba and
Caricom, enhancing sugar cane yields, boosting co-operation in developing
livestock and fisheries, and will combine research in biotechnology,
particularly for agricultural and technical applications.
Caricom officials say the wording of the agreement was changed to make it
consistent with that of similar agreements signed with countries such as
Venezuela and Mexico, and one which is being negotiated with Colombia.
'People will need to have it explained to them why Caricom believed that
Cuba should, in effect, be given a bye on democracy,' said Ms Hrinak. US
officials had earlier complained that Caricom was 'rewarding' Cuba by
improving links without winning commitment to political change.
'I do not expect the US to be happy with what Caricom has done,' said Mr
John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia. 'But the Caribbean is
consistent in its position. Mexico and Canada never broke ties with Cuba,
yet the US has embraced both of these countries warmly in the North American
Free Trade Agreement.'
US President Bill Clinton has invited the leaders of Bahamas, Guyana,
Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago to discuss hemispheric issues on
August 30.
'The meeting will provide an opportunity for the president and the Caribbean
leaders to advance their common agenda of promoting democracy and good
governance, stimulating trade opportunities and job creation, protecting the
environment and fighting drug trafficking,' a statement from the White House
said yesterday.
Meanwhile, Cubans are clearly happy that the agreement with their neighbours
has been concluded to their satisfaction. Mr Lazaro Cabezas, Cuba's
ambassador to the eastern Caribbean, said it represented a deepening of
links between his country and others in the region.
'Cuba has been training doctors from Caricom countries and providing
technical assistance to many,' he said. 'But the prospects for trade between
Cuba and the Caricom states has increased significantly with this agreement
on the joint commission.'

with a new generation of high-speed trains, writes David Waller in
Frankfurt.
The consortium - consisting of Siemens, the Munich-based electricals and
electronics company, and AEG, the electronics division of Daimler-Benz -
will deliver 60 of the new trains to the German Bundesbahn between mid-1996
and the end of 1998.
The new trains will run at speeds of 280km/hour.
The German companies will work with Deutsche Waggonbau Aktiengesellschaft,

<TEXT>
HIMONT, the US-based chemicals company controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi group,
has postponed the start-up of its latest polypropylene plant, believed to
have cost more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m), because of the recession.
The Brindisi facility in southern Italy has the capacity to produce 180,000
tonnes of polypropylene a year, making it one of the largest of its kind in
Europe.
Originally, Himont expected that the new plant and an earlier 160,000 tonne
parallel facility in Brindisi would meet about 10 per cent of estimated
demand in the European Community for polypropylene.
However, leading polypropylene producers have been severely affected by the
recession, notably in the motor vehicle industry, which is one of their main
customers. The commissioning of new plant has exacerbated existing
overcapacity, while manufacturers have responded with cut-throat price
competition.
Ferruzzi gave no indication when production at the new unit would begin. The
plant will be moth-balled for at least the rest of this year, with
production being put off 'in anticipation of more favourable market
conditons,' it said.

FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: ABB in link with Russian carmaker

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has formed a joint
venture with AvtoVAZ (Volga Auto Works), Russia's largest car manufacturer,
to make fans in Russia for the domestic and industrial ventilation market.
The deal, announced yesterday, is another step in ABB's strategy to develop
local production in Russia, which it views as a long-term opportunity. For
AvtoVAZ, which makes Lada cars, the deal provides a use for spare capacity
at its sprawling plant at Togliatti on the Volga River.
A new company, Lada-Flakt, will manufacture ABB Flakt designs of axial-flow
fans, which are more efficient and effective than conventional fans.
ABB said axial-flow fans were a well-established product in western markets,
but were not well known in Russia. 'This is why we feel we have a good
chance to introduce the product,' it said.
ABB will own 50 per cent of the new company, with 10 per cent owned by
AvtoVAZ and 40 per cent by Ladainvest. The latter includes stake holdings by
Lada Holding Company, Lada Bank and the Lada workers, who will have a 16 per
cent stake in the venture as part of the continuing privatisation process of
AvtoVAZ.
ABB will provide technical know-how and special machinery. Lada will provide
3,000 sq metres of factory buildings and remaining plant and machinery for
the fan factory, which will employ about 100 existing Lada workers.
ABB said production would begin at the beginning of next year, and annual
turnover was expected to be Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.7m). The joint venture
would supply the Russian home market and countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States with a new generation of axial-flow fan designs.
ABB confirmed last month that it is in talks over the future of a Russian
defence and aero-engine factory. It would not give further details yesterday
on these talks, which could result in a joint venture to produce power plant
for the local market.
AvtoVAZ has already established contacts with western companies in the
automotive industry, but yesterday's deal is understood to be the first with
a company outside the automotive industry.
In February it formed a vehicle parts joint venture with Federal-Mogul and
Allied-Signal of the US, and Sogefi of Italy. General Motors of the US is
supplying engine control systems to the Russian company, whose car plant is
one of the largest in the world.
ABB has confirmed it received a SFr322m (Pounds 144.7m) order in March for a
power station from the Libyan state's Secretariat of Energy, Reuter reports
from Zurich.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KWU, the power engineering arm of Germany's Siemens industrial group, has
signed a co-operation agreement with KTZ, Russia's largest industrial
turbine manufacturer, for joint production and marketing both in Russia and
on the world market.
At the same time Siemens/KWU will take up a 10 per cent shareholding in the
Russian enterprise, which was privatised in January.
The deal was signed in Kaluga, 250km south of Moscow, where KTZ is based.
A spokesman for KWU said yesterday that the deal would give Siemens access
for the first time to the Russian market for smaller industrial turbines. At
the same time, KTZ would be able to provide components for Siemens turbines
on the international market at competitive prices, and Siemens would help
the Russian concern market its own products world-wide.
No price was put on the share purchase, although the nominal value of the
shares is Rbs62m. In addition, KWU will provide the Russian enterprise with
machinery and know-how to overhaul its production plant.
The Russian manufacturer employs 9,200 workers, and has a market share in
the former Soviet Union of around 50 per cent, KWU said. It is the largest
supplier of turbines up to 35MW capacity.
KTZ, the Kalushsky Turbiny Zavod, is now 40 per cent owned by its workforce
and 40 per cent by the Russian government. KWU has taken up half the
remaining shares, with the rest distributed amongst smaller shareholders.
Although KWU already has good connections in the big power station market in
Russia - it signed a joint venture to build gas turbines in St Petersburg
with the turbine manufacturer LMZ in recent weeks - the new deal is its
first in the smaller industrial turbine market.
'We will get the opportunity, on the one hand, to offer our turbines in the
future on the Russian market, which we believe has great potential,' KWU
said. 'Apart from that, we will be able to buy components from KTZ for our
turbines at favourable prices, improving our competitiveness in
international markets.'

investment institutions, Mr Hsu said in a statement. 'This is the first time
that (Taiwan) has signed an agreement on the protection of industrial
property with a foreign country on an equal and mutually beneficial basis,'
he said.
Australia and Taiwan do not have diplomatic relations because Canberra
switched recognition to China in 1972.
But Australian investment in Taiwan totals about USDollars 156m (Pounds
105m) and recorded Taiwanese investment in Australia is about Dollars 17m,
according to Taiwan.

FT  18 AUG 93 / South-east leads US recovery: A look at the advantages of a
diverse economic base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Washington frets about lagging job creation in the nation's glacially
paced economic recovery, the South-east of the US is looking rosy on this
score: the region is leading the country in job growth and its economy is
rebounding faster than most others.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the region's eight states
gained 30 per cent of all the 516,000 new jobs generated nationally during
the first quarter, the latest period analysed. The region also accounted for
75 per cent of 28,000 new manufacturing jobs added nationally in the period.
The South-east's employment gains earlier this year were not just a
fortuitous blip. The trend appeared to continue through the second quarter,
according to Mr Donald Ratajczak, chief of the economic forecasting centre
at Georgia State University. He said that, unlike the nation, which
struggled at an overall economic growth rate of only 1.6 per cent during the
second quarter, the South-east expanded at about 3 per cent.
The South-east's comparative prosperity is a feature of the unusually slow
and very uneven national recovery, according to the Conference Board, the
New York-based business think-tank. The organisation says that, unlike past,
more robust recoveries, this one lacks a federal fiscal stimulus that helps
the economy across the board. Consequently, 'divergent regional trends are
dominating the economic landscape.'
The sharp differences in regional fortunes have led many to ask why some
areas are prospering so disproportionately. Aside from the South-east, the
Rocky Mountain states and the Mid-west have also fared relatively well since
the recession of 1990-1991.
In the South-east, where job growth is strongest, analysts say that a
diverse economic base is what has helped most. The region has a substantial
amount of manufacturing in auto assembly, transportation equipment, building
materials, home furnishings, textiles, chemicals, and food processing. It
has also been less dependent on military contracting than other areas being
hit with defence industry shrinkage.
The construction of BMW's new plant in western South Carolina is a boon in
that state. Rising US car and truck sales are benefiting Japan's Nissan and
GM's Saturn plants in Tennessee and Daimler Benz's truck assembly operation
in North Carolina, which also appears poised to win the contest for Daimler
Benz's new US car plant. The company, which is expected to make an
announcement about its site selection by the end of this year, has been
buying up land options near its truck plant.
The region, especially the Carolinas, has been a magnet for foreign
manufacturing investment because of relatively low production costs and
wages. Service employment, up strongly, is also fairly well spread among
banking, insurance, retail, communications, transportation, biotechnology
and other sectors.
But the region's exceptional growth is in large measure being fuelled by
construction. According to Mr Thomas Cunningham, chief regional economist at
the Atlanta Federal Reserve, it has a concentration of the industries that
benefit most from the early stages of recovery. The region's building
materials, textiles, furniture and white goods sectors have all been boosted
by a nation-wide recuperation of the housing market.
The South has in fact led the surge in new home buying, thanks partly to
migration from less prosperous regions. In addition, rebuilding after
Hurricane Andrew last year in Florida has helped lift regional construction
businesses.
Mr Cunningham also points out that, while the South-east is faring better
than most other areas on job growth, the national figures on employment
gains are being brought down by large job losses in just five big states,
California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.
Nonetheless, attitudes in the South-east also seems distinct from the rest
of the nation. Consumer spending has been outpacing the nation as a whole.
Even the political mindset appears to be a factor: 'You don't have the yo-yo
effect of consumers in other parts of the country,' says Mr Ratajczak. 'We
were never that thrilled with Clinton's victory or chagrined with his
policy.'

FT  18 AUG 93 / Dole attacks Bosnia moves as 'invitation to dictators'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Robert Dole, leader of the minority Republicans in the US Senate and
a possible opponent of President Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential
election, yesterday delivered a fierce attack on the UN and its role in the
Bosnian conflict.
He criticised the terms of the Bosnian peace settlement now being negotiated
in Geneva, calling it - in reference to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
 -'an invitation to the brutal dictator in Belgrade' to continue oppressing
his own people and to launch a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the
Albanian population in Kosovo.
'It's also going to be an invitation to other dictators or would-be
aggressors lurking in the shadows of the former Soviet Union. How many thugs
around the world will RSVP to that invitation? How many of those thugs have
access to chemical or nuclear weapons?' he said at a meeting of the National
Governors' Association in Oklahoma.
Mr Dole opposed the UN embargo on arms shipments to the former Yugoslavia.
Many have argued this leaves Bosnia at a disadvantage to Serbia, which has
access to the arms of the former Yugoslav federal army. 'Bosnia is being
gobbled up defenceless because of an arms embargo that violates the very
principles of the UN.'
Some of Mr Dole's harshest criticism, however, was reserved for the UN and
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, its secretary-general, whom the US senator accused
of being more concerned about who was in charge than about getting things
done.
'The UN does not stand for the same principles as the US. . . The last time
I checked, the American people did not elect Boutros Boutros Ghali to run US
foreign policy.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is preparing to place Sudan on
the US list of states accused of sponsoring terrorism, officials said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. An announcement could come as
soon as today, they said.
The US has been increasingly concerned about Sudan's ties to Iran and
radical groups and this is to be the basis of Mr Christopher's decision, the
officials said.
But the determination also comes after an ABC Television report on Monday
that US intelligence officials believe top government officials of Sudan
were involved in a plot earlier this year to blow up the United Nations, FBI
headquarters and two tunnels in New York.
Citing intelligence sources, ABC television news said federal agents, after
monitoring Sudan's mission to the UN for two months and from other evidence,
felt the government of Sudan was involved in the alleged plot last June.
The ABC report named two Sudanese intelligence officers as the link between
Sudan and the alleged plot.
The report said US officials believed the men helped five other Sudanese
residents of the US who were indicted in the bombing conspiracy.
There is no evidence that Sudan's ambassador to the UN, Mr Ahmed Suliman,
was involved, the ABC report said.
Mr Suliman in June denied that the mission had anything to do with the
planned bombings in New York, and said that terrorism was 'alien' to his
country.
Mr Christopher was 'expected to make an announcement about his decision
within a matter of days,' a State Department official said. Another official
said Mr Christopher was 'preparing to conduct the necessary notification of
foreign governments and members of Congress' that Sudan has been placed on
the terrorism list.

FT  18 AUG 93 / California rethinks unitary tax system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S legislature will today open discussions on changes to its
unitary tax law that might help head off a threat of retaliation from the
UK. But already British MPs are warning the proposed changes do not go far
enough.
The dispute arises from California's system of worldwide unitary taxation -
the subject of a long-running legal case involving Barclays Bank, the
British clearing bank - under which companies may be taxed on a proportion
of their worldwide revenues, instead of only on revenues earned in the
state, as is the case in most jurisdictions.
Bowing to pressure from the federal government, California has already made
the unitary system optional.
But foreign companies complain the Californian tax authorities charge a fee
if they choose the alternative 'water's edge' assessment system, which
includes only activities within the US, and reserve the right to impose a
unitary assessment.
Backed tacitly by the Clinton administration in Washington, UK officials
have been urging California to move towards a mandatory water's edge system.
This system was backed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, in a recent letter to Sir Michael Grylls, the Conservative MP who
has been leading the British parliamentary battle against unitary taxation.
Mandatory water's edge would in fact raise more money for the state -
perhaps as much as Dollars 175m (Pounds 117.4m) a year - but for this reason
has been hotly opposed by Californian companies which benefit from the
unitary assessment.
Administration officials hope that if California can settle the dispute with
the UK, they will not have to take a position on the Barclays case.
The Supreme Court has asked for the administration's views on whether it
should hear the case, but President Bill Clinton would prefer neither to
argue openly against the UK nor to side with the UK against California in
breach of a written campaign promise to Mr Brad Sherman, a member of the
California franchise tax board.
Although the bill under formal consideration by the Californian Senate
finance committee today proposes mandatory water's edge, its author, Senator
Alfred Alquist, believes that this would not pass the legislature.
He intends to modify the bill to address only some specific foreign
complaints, including the compliance costs and the tax authorities' ability
to overrule a choice of water's edge assessment.
Officials in Sacramento believe the legislature may also eliminate the fee
levied on companies which make the water's edge choice. If it does so, it
would have to come up with perhaps Dollars 70m in additional revenues to
offset the lost money.
Sir Michael Grylls, however, has written to Mr Alquist to warn him that the
UK would not be satisfied with only limited legislation.
'The UK's resolve on retaliation, in the absence of a satisfactory solution,
remains undiminished and should not be underestimated,' he wrote yesterday.
British retaliation, involving the withdrawal of a tax credit granted to US
companies operating in the UK, is due to take effect at the beginning of
next year if the dispute is not settled.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Housing starts fall by 2.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US housing market is continuing to move sideways despite the lowest
mortgage rates in two decades, figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael
Prowse in Washington.
The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2.7 per cent between June
and July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21m. In the first seven
months of the year, starts were only 2.3 per cent higher than in the same
period last year. The market's relative weakness may reflect consumers'
reluctance to make long-term financial commitments because of doubts about
job security.
The weakness last month was concentrated in the Midwest, where building
activity was adversely affected by flooding, and in California where
economic recovery has been slow to take hold.
Starts rose modestly in the northeast and south. Building permits were more
encouraging, rising 3 per cent last month and by 4 per cent in the first
seven months relative to the same period last year.

India is planning further liberalisation of currency regulations after

Measures being considered by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) include
permitting cross-currency options and letting local banks invest in
short-term deposits with banks overseas, they said.
'Dismantling of these restrictions could be the first steps towards the full
convertibility of the Indian rupee on current account and later on capital
account,' a banker said.

South Korea has asked Israel to stop seeking an improvement in relations
with North Korea until suspicions about Pyongyang's nuclear programme are
resolved, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The South Korean request followed a meeting between Israeli and North Korean
officials last week in Beijing.
Israel has held talks with North Korea to persuade it to stop supplying
Scud-C missiles to Syria and Iran. The tempo of contacts has increased
following North Korea's successful test firing in May of its Rodong-I
ballistic missile. North Korea reportedly has agreed to sell the missile to
Iran. The Rodong-I could reach Israel from western Iran.

Japan and France will each pay Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.7m) towards settling
Vietnam's Dollars 140m arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
sources close to negotiations on the deal said yesterday in Hanoi, Reuter
reports from Hanoi.
At least five other countries - Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany and
Sweden - are expected to supply the remaining Dollars 40m, the sources said.
Paying off the arrears will enable Vietnam - in line for up to Dollars 1bn
in new multilateral funding to improve its infrastructure - to seek fresh
IMF loans in return for agreement on a structural adjustment programme.
The seven countries and possibly others are due to attend a Vietnam support
group conference in Paris in mid-September to sort out the repayments,
expected to be made through a banking consortium led by the Banque Francaise
du Commerce Exterieur.

The official Antara news agency quoted Maj Gen Theo Syafei, military

Since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 it has fought a

apparent military success the government has come under heavy international
attack for its role in the territory, 2,000km east of Jakarta.

KING HUSSEIN last night announced a controversial amendment to Jordan's
election law, paving the way for the country's first multi-party elections
since 1956, writes James Whittington in Amman.
In a televised speech, he said the elections, due on November 8, would be
based on one-person, one-vote. This is widely seen as an attempt to curb the
success of Moslem fundamentalists, who won 30 out of 80 seats at the last
elections in 1989.
Under the now defunct election law, each voter cast more than one vote,
depending on the number of seats in a constituency - up to eight in some
cases. This was viewed by the government as favouring large groups, such as
the Islamists, who were able to field a number of candidates in each
constituency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida yesterday told Nigeria's National Assembly that
he had offered to resign as president and chief of the armed forces, but
refused to say whether he actually planned to leave office.
His speech, which had been keenly awaited, failed to remove the uncertainty
about the country's political future that followed Gen Babangida's decision
to annul the June 12 presidential election.
Despite hopes that he might use the address to outline his own plans and the
government's future, he told Nigerians that they 'should see the present
political situation as a temporary problem and rethink our journey so far,
and our future'.
The president has said he will turn over power to an interim government made
up of civilians and soldiers, but has not said whether he will step down on
August 27, his long-promised deadline for democracy.
Speaking to a joint session of both houses of the National Assembly in
Abuja, the president stressed the interim government was not an extension,
but a replacement of the military regime. He said he would announce its
composition 'in the next few days'.
Defending his position, he said that there was no alternative to the choice
of a president for Nigeria by democratic election, but the interim
government was 'the most feasible' arrangement under the circumstances.
The president's address to the National Assembly was the first in eight
months.
He said he had run the most documented administration in his country's
history and would place before Nigerians a full account of his stewardship
during the period of the interim government.
'I shall also be prepared and ready at the end of the interim government to
pass on my experience in defence and security matters and any information
relevant to the state,' he said.
The political crisis has raised regional, religious and ethnic tensions in
the country, triggering three days of riots that killed more than 100 people
in Lagos last month and a general strike last week that shut the city down
for three days.
Thousands of people have fled to their ethnic homelands in anticipation of
widespread civil unrest.
Gen Babangida has repeatedly reneged on promises to return the nation to
democracy.
Nigeria has been ruled by the military for the past decade and all but 10 of
its 33 years of independence from Britain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB guerrillas blasted positions of Israel's proxy militia in southern
Lebanon drawing retaliatory fire yesterday, in the fiercest attack on the
zone since last month's Israeli offensive.
The resurgence of violence came a day after Syria, the main power-broker in
Lebanon, warned the Beirut government against taking independent action in
southern Lebanon, such as the recent decision to deploy Lebanese soldiers in
the area.
The pro-Iranian Hizbollah, which constitutes the backbone of the Lebanese
'resistance' to the Israeli control of a self-declared security zone in
southern Lebanon, has vowed to continue attacks despite an informal
ceasefire agreement brokered last month by Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state.
Israel has said it will respond harshly to any new attacks on its forces.
A further escalation in violence is expected in the run-up to the eleventh
round of Middle East peace talks, due in two weeks in Washington, which
Hizbollah opposes.
Syria, which could exert its influence to curb Hizbollah attacks, has sent
conflicting signals about peace with Israel and the role of Hizbollah, which
it continues to use as leverage against the Jewish state.
Last month, during Mr Christopher's visit to the region, President Hafez
al-Assad bolstered Israeli hopes of a breakthrough in bilateral peace talks
by sending a series of messages to Jerusalem.
However, the Syrian leader has refused to completely halt Hizbollah's
activities and has strongly criticised the Lebanese government's troop
deployment, which was scaled down when Damascus expressed reservations.
Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it would -
for the first time - appoint some Palestinian negotiators from the
Israeli-occupied territories to its highest decision-making bodies. The PLO,
ruling out prospects for progress in the next peace talks, made the move as
part of its continuing strategy to force Israel to open a direct dialogue
with the organisation as the only way to unblock the peace process.

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAKISTANI government is this week expected to announce a new wealth tax
on landowners, and also a possible income tax on agriculture, according to
senior officials.
The taxes would be seen as a breakthrough by the government of Mr Moeen
Qureshi, the interim prime minister who was appointed last month.
Pakistan's influential landowners are exempt from paying income and wealth
taxes, and former prime ministers Mr Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto both
failed to widen the tax net to include the landowners, for fear of a
political backlash.
However, Mr Qureshi, a former vice-president of the World Bank, says that he
does not intend to seek political office after the elections which are due
in October.
The interim government's determined stance is also expected to contain tough
new measures in an effort to curb expenditure.
These include cutting the number of federal ministries, and a drive to
prevent tax evasion and improve the public sector's financial position by
raising utility charges and recovering arrears.
Meanwhile, Pakistan's central bank this week raised its discount rate from
15 to 17 per cent in an effort to encourage savings.
The commercial banks have since followed suit, raising their interest rates
by 2 per cent to 22 per cent.
The rises have jolted both money and stock markets, with some financial
analysts and businesses expressing concern that they could depress rather
than stabilise the economy.

THE SINGAPORE government has announced details of the partial privatisation
of Singapore Telecom (ST), the state-owned telecommunications and postal
service.
Mr Mah Bow Tan, the Singapore communications minister, said the government
planned to float an initial 6 to 8 per cent of ST in October, with about
half the first offering of shares being available through tender and open to
foreign investors, and the rest allocated to Singapore citizens.
ST is one of Singapore's most successful and cash rich companies and the
flotation of the company has been billed as the largest single privatisation
so far in South-East Asia.
However there was some surprise among Singapore's financial community that a
greater share of the company would not be available in the initial offering.
Mr Mah said a second public offering would be made within three years and
eventually the government planned to sell off up to 25 per cent of ST.
'The government is being ultra cautious on this one,' said one broker. 'ST
is a prime state asset. The government is determined to make sure nothing
goes wrong.'
When floated, it is estimated that ST will be worth between Dollars S15bn
and Dollars S20bn (Pounds 6.36bn-Pounds 8.48bn).
The Singapore government is making efforts to increase public share
ownership and has offered a number of incentives to people to buy ST shares.
Participants in Singapore's Central Provident Fund, a compulsory savings
scheme, will be able to buy quantities of ST shares at a 45 per cent
discount. There will also be bonus issues for those who hold on to their
shares for an extended period.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Yen eases against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN fell against the dollar in Tokyo yesterday for the first time in
more than a week after the new seven-party government signalled that it
intended to formulate measures to deal with its advance.
An official said the strength of the yen - which traded within a fraction of
Y100 to the dollar yesterday and is devastating exporters - would be high on
the agenda when key cabinet ministers meet tomorrow to assess prospects for
the country's emergence from economic slowdown.
Before the meeting, called last week, the coalition indicated only that
short-, medium- and long-term measures could all be deployed to check the
rise in the yen. The first of these would need to be implemented by autumn.
The Bank of Japan has been widely expected to cut its official discount rate
next month by half a point to an historic low of 2 per cent. Business is
also calling for an early deregulation of utility rates and a fiscal
stimulus to the domestic economy.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, who will return from holiday for the
meeting, said from a mountain resort north-west of Tokyo that it must be
ensured that calm returns to the currency market.
Mr Hosokawa's comments came as the yen traded in Tokyo at a morning high of
Y100.40, but the rate to the US unit closed at Y101.55, down Y0.30 on the
day as dealers moved to cover short positions.
The government has avoided indicating whether it has in prospect a package
of public works spending and tax cuts of the order of the Y13,200bn (Pounds
88bn) unveiled by the previous Liberal Democratic party administration in
April or the Y10,700bn meted out last August.
At the resort, Karuizawa, Mr Hosokawa yesterday met Mr Keiichi Miyazawa, his
LDP predecessor, to disucss Japan-US trade friction and other issues.
In Washington overnight Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury undersecretary,
urged Japan to take measures of this nature to help reduce its trade
surplus.
An increase in net payments to the private sector by the government was the
prime reason given by Bank of Japan officials yesterday for a 1.7 per cent
rise in M2 money supply in July.
The year-on-year growth came for the fourth month in a row, and was sharper
than a 1.4 per cent increase in June.
The construction ministry said June public works starts were up 1.5 per cent
from 1992 but for the private sector were down 25.6 per cent.
At tomorrow's meeting ministers may disavow suggestions being made by
officials in mid-year that the economy had touched bottom.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Australia expects record ADollars 16bn budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday forecast a record ADollars 16bn (Pounds
7.4bn) budget deficit, moderate economic growth and higher inflation in the
first budget since it won re-election in March.
Measures in the budget for the 1993-94 fiscal year contained few surprises
because most, including cuts in personal tax rates from November, had been
foreshadowed during the election campaign. A cut in the company tax rate
from 39 to 33 per cent from July 1 had also been signalled.
However Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, announced an immediate increase
of one percentage point in all wholesale sales tax rates, and a further one
point increase from July 1995. He increased taxes on petrol, alcohol and
tobacco and broadened fringe benefits subject to tax to include
entertainment spending, club fees and travel expenses.
The government plans to cut defence spending and to tighten up social
security payments and health rebates.
Mr Dawkins said the budget would provide a ADollars 2bn stimulus to the
economy in order to create jobs. However, he forecast no significant fall
over the next year in the 10.7 per cent unemployment rate.
'The fiscal challenge is to continue the stimulus to activity over the next
year to encourage economic recovery and job growth, while setting in train
medium-term adjustments to significantly increase public-sector saving,' he
said.
The budget deficit was forecast to rise to ADollars 16bn in the coming
financial year from ADollars 14.5bn in the year ending June 30, 1993. This
will force the government to find new funding of ADollars 21.9bn compared
with ADollars 20.3bn.
Mr Dawkins said the budget deficit would be reduced to ADollars 5.8bn in
1996-97, partly by deferring a second round of personal tax cuts.
He forecast the economy would grow at an average rate of 2.75 per cent
during in the next financial year - only a slight increase from 2.5 per cent
in the year nearly ended - but that the rate would accelerate to more than 3
per cent in the second half of the year.
Consumer price inflation would rise to 3.5 per cent from this year's 1 per
cent, partly as a result of the indirect tax increases and of the fall of
the Australian dollar, which dropped to a record low on a trade-weighted
basis in June. The current account deficit was expected to grow to ADollars
18bn from ADollars 15.4bn.
Mr Dawkins said the budget established a four-year framework which would
enable interest rates and inflation to remain low. On Australian credit
markets, however, bond prices weakened because of fears the higher than
expected inflation forecast could lead to interest rate rises.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Japan's LDP fears for its cash supply: Company doubts over
party donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party, out of office for the first time in 38
years, suddenly also finds itself seriously out of pocket.
The country's biggest companies began saying yesterday that they were
halting contributions to the LDP and its parliamentary representatives after
learning that the Keidanren, the leading business grouping, was backing
efforts by the new ruling coalition to clean up politics.
The Keidanren is from next year to stop acting as a conduit of funds from
its members to political parties, of which the most by far has gone to the
LDP. Although federation officials said it would be up to companies whether
they made donations directly, as many have done in addition, its move is
influencing the private sector to scale these back too.
Mr Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon, the camera and copier producer, said
his company would halt all political donations. 'Nothing will change unless
companies drive the political world into a corner,' he added. Officials at
the country's big trading houses said they too were suspending
contributions.
The Keidanren decision cuts off an annual line of funds to the LDP put at
more than Y10bn (Pounds 66.7m). With other corporate and industry
association pledges it forms the bulk of the party's declared central
funding of nearly Y30bn a year.
Other corporate donations have gone to individual Diet members, most
notoriously by construction companies seeking to ease the path to winning a
contract or cut a way through a regulatory tangle.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, Keidanren chairman, in explaining the initiative
acknowledged that the public believed the donations had bought Keidanren
members favours from the LDP during its years in government, although he
denied this was the case.
His move, which comes as parliament prepares to discuss political reform
next week, anticipates proposed measures to shift the basis of party funding
in Japan towards donations by individual supporters plus assistance from
central government funds.
The Japan New party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, says a
checkoff system of voluntary payroll debits is being examined, and that it
would possibly offer tax incentives for those who sign up - the
justification being that the system would involve citizens more in the
democratic process.
Its final form remains unclear, however, and is likely to be the subject of
parliamentary haggling not only with the LDP, which will fight against any
tough curbs on corporate funding, but also among the seven members of the
coalition. One of its number, the Democratic Socialist party - which despite
its name is a former close ally of the LDP - has also been a beneficiary of
Keidanren funds, getting Y1bn a year.
'Underhand donations are bad, but it is not natural to stop legitimate
donations,' the DSP complained this week.
It and the Social Democratic party, which is more strictly socialist in
nature and is the largest of the seven, are both suggesting that a new
funding arrangement would need to be phased in over a few years. The SDP
draws much of its funds from trade unions, and is willing to forego these
only if it can be assured of an adequate replacement.
Mr Hosokawa has pledged to enact political reform by the end of the year,
paving the way for fresh polls next summer under a changed electoral system.
Whether an alternative stream of funds for candidates to fight that campaign
will by then be running remains uncertain.
The LDP is additionally burdened with an estimated Y10bn in commercial bank
borrowings used to help finance last month's campaign.
'Does it mean the LDP is no longer needed following the collapse of the cold
war structure, even though the party has protected the free-market economy?'
one unnamed party official was quoted as asking.
Each year from then, party leaders would go to the Keidanren with a budget.
This the federation would apportion among its members on the basis of how
business had been for their company and sector - from each according to its
ability, to the LDP according to its needs.
Big business is likely to retain ties of a sort with the LDP, not least
because the durability of the current coalition remains in doubt. But the
severing of the party edifice from its financial plinth resounded in Tokyo
yesterday like the toppling of a Soviet statue in an east European capital.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Bosnia talks at impasse on carve-up

BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday remained at loggerheads with
his Serb adversaries over the division of Serb-held eastern Bosnia, which
was mostly Moslem before the outbreak of war 17 months ago.
The deadlock highlighted the apparently irreconcilable differences between
the two sides over eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serbs claim most of the region,
which borders on Serbia.
After 10 hours of talks, Mr Izetbegovic said bluntly: 'No progress was made
all day'.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said it was 'absolutely
impossible' for eastern Bosnia to belong to the Moslems. 'The only thing
which can be done at all is to give the safe areas to the Moslem republic.
There is proof for everywhere else that the Serbs comprised a majority in
this century.' Mr Karadzic rejected the official census reports of 1991 as
'rewarding genocide against the Serbs in the second world war'.
Mr Mohamed Filipovic, a Moslem, said the two sides 'were operating on
completely different principles', one based on military gains and the other
on ethnic composition of areas before the fighting.
The impasse came a day after the announcement that the leaders of Bosnia's
three warring parties had agreed 'in principle' to demilitarise Sarajevo and
place it under temporary UN administration.
But after the first meeting of the three-man committee set up to make
recommendations on the future status of Sarajevo, Mr Filipovic, one of its
members, said: 'The only thing we agreed on is that we disagree.'
He added that the US was trying to exert pressure on the Serbian side in the
Geneva talks, while Lord Owen was trying to soften that pressure, as the
international mediators pressed forward with negotiations on maps.
Mr John Zametica, the Bosnian Serb spokesman, said Serbs were willing to
make some compromises over the eastern enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde and
Srebrenica. Serb forces have confined many Moslems into these three
enclaves, proclaimed 'safe areas' by the UN.
Bosnia's UN envoy yesterday attacked the British chief of staff of UN troops
in Bosnia, Brigadier Vere Hayes, Reuter reports from New York. The
brigadier's comments had been 'insensitive, sometimes total falsehoods, and
insulting,' he said.
Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey said the brigadier had suggested that the Serbs
had shown good faith by withdrawing from two mountain strongholds, that
Sarajevo was no longer under siege, and that Moslems were responsible for
blocking the humanitarian relief to Sarajevo because of fighting in central
Bosnia.

A Serb-Croat proposal for the maps leaves the Moslems, who made up 44 per
cent of the pre-war population of 4.35m, in a landlocked republic consisting
of two parts as well as the three pockets in eastern Bosnia, writes Laura
Silber. However, the plan gives no guarantees to the Moslems of access to
Adriatic ports. In a report earlier this month, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary-general, said the enclaves would be linked to the mostly
Moslem Bosnian republic by 'access authority throughways'. This proposal was
accepted after 'intense negotiations with the Serb side'. In contrast, a map
proposed by the Bosnian government claims most of eastern Bosnia and
territorial access to ports on the Sava River and the Adriatic.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Nato faces a Sarajevo dilemma: The setting up of a UN
protectorate needs political will as well as firepower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Monday's tentative agreement at the Bosnian peace talks on the future
of Sarajevo might have marked a welcome breakthrough for the Geneva
mediators, it has left Nato facing another military headache.
Few doubt that if the settlement being discussed at Geneva is to have any
hope of success, it will require the largest ever deployment of peacekeeping
forces in the United Nations' history.
But though a speedy deployment will be essential for the policing of any
agreement, diplomatic sources yesterday indicated that the key questions of
who would provide the troops - let alone actually pay for them - remains far
from resolved.
Although Nato officials insist that there is still the political will in the
alliance to ensure the necessary deployment, the failure to reach an
agreement so far remains one of the many 'chicken and egg' dilemmas that
could yet derail the peace process. Without a firm military commitment to
police a settlement, there seems little likelihood of ending the
negotiations. However, after months of broken ceasefires and peace
agreements, most western countries argue that they cannot offer more troops
until they have a clear agreement.
A Nato source in Brussels yesterday said: 'The fact is that without
implementation there can be no agreement. President (Alija) Izetbegovic is
never going to sign anything until he thinks he knows exactly what
protection he will have.' Faced with this situation, Lord Owen, the
international mediator, was yesterday at pains to reassure the Moslem
delegation that the 3,000 UN protection troops currently in Sarajevo should
be enough to make the recent agreement to run the city as a UN protectorate
viable.
In practice though, UN officials admit that they have little idea what the
protectorate would actually entail. They point out that if the peace-keepers
are to act as anything more than military observers, they would probably
require a force of at least 6,000. Further afield, the figures become even
more uncertain. The previous peace settlement drawn up in the spring, which
divided Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, envisaged a peace-keeping
force of around 70,000, of which a third were expected to be US troops.
Under the present plan, on the basis that fewer borders would require fewer
soldiers, military strategists now believe that some 35,000 to 45,000 troops
would be sufficient for the operation, according to some diplomats.
Since the UN already has 24,000 ground troops in the former Yugoslavia, of
which 10,000 are currently in Bosnia, Nato officials argue these troops
could provide the necessary stop-gap solution.
But since they are operating under a humanitarian brief, deploying them as
peace-keepers would require a new UN resolution - potentially another
delaying factor. And with the UN already facing its worst cash crisis in its
history - in which the countries contributing peace-keeping troops are
already owed some Dollars 360m (Pounds 241.6m)  - it remains unclear where
the extra 20,000-plus troops would come from.
In the light of Washington's previous refusal to commit any ground troops,
the European members of Nato are now hoping that the largest provider will
now be the United States.
One possibility suggested by a Nato source, was for the US to spearhead the
initial peace-keeping force - as in Somalia - before withdrawing after
several months to be replaced with a much smaller, more 'traditional' UN
peace-keeping force, in which a large proportion of the troops would
probably be from non-Nato countries.
But with the US government facing strong opposition in Congress against any
agreement which would leave it endorsing an ethnic partition of Bosnia,
Washington has pointedly refrained in recent days from making watertight
commitments on the issue. Countries such as Britain and France, which have
so far contributed the largest number of troops to Bosnia, appear reluctant
to envisage any broader commitment.
Meanwhile, as military experts point out, even if an agreement is reached,
the deployment itself is unlikely to be speedy.
Colonel Andrew Duncan, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London, said: 'Generally it would take at least a month before they could
set off.
'You've got to paint the vehicles white, find the blue hats, set up the
communication network - all these details take time.'

A CRIPPLING strike by Romanian train drivers appeared to be winding down
late yesterday after Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, prime minister, warned of instant
dismissal unless workers returned to work.
Mr Vacaroiu's ultimatum came at the end of an emergency meeting of the
minority left-wing government which he called to take 'exceptional measures'
against the week-old pay strike, taking place in defiance of an 80-day
supreme court ban on work stoppages.
Radio Bucharest later reported that by the government's evening deadline
most of the 18,000 striking railway workers were back at work in the capital
Bucharest and most other big cities.
There were some holdouts in Iasi, Brasov and Timisoara.

<TEXT>
THE Romanian prime minister, Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, yesterday gave striking
train drivers an ultimatum to get back to work or face instant dismissal and
replacement by pensioners.
Mr Vacaroiu's announcement came at the end of an emergency meeting of the
minority left-wing government which he called to take 'exceptional measures'
against the week-old pay strike.
The strikers have already ignored appeals by President Ion Iliescu and their
own union to end the strike which is taking place in defiance of an 80-day
supreme court ban on work stoppages.
President Iliescu chided the train drivers by saying they were already a
privileged group of workers with an average wage higher than the country's
university professors, surgeons and airline pilots. The cabinet claimed the
stoppage had caused losses to the country equivalent to Dollars 317m (Pounds
212m).
A government statement said extra police and gendarmes would be posted to
guard stations and depots in case of disturbances and would be used to
remove strikers from railway property if necessary. 'We urge retired train
drivers who wish to help the country in this difficult moment to go to
railway offices to register for work,' the statement added.
The drivers are seeking a 20-30 per cent wage rise and new pay
differentials.

AFTER three years of steady market reforms, the Czech economy remains
hamstrung by a recession which is proving more difficult to shake off than
expected, though officials believe the worst may be over.
The finance minister, Mr Ivan Kocarnik, is confident the government's 1993
targets will be met, though with a more modest growth rate of 1 per cent and
with inflation - aggravated by the introduction of value added tax in
January - at around 17 per cent.
The Czech National Bank endorsed the minister's cautious optimism in a
report showing private and public demand rising 12 per cent and 16 per cent
respectively in the first half of the year compared with the period in 1992.
But analysts believe it will be difficult to turn around an economy
labouring under a fourth consecutive year of declining output. Industrial
production dropped 4 per cent and gross domestic product fell 1 per cent in
the first six months compared with last year, when output already had
declined sharply.
Efforts to build a market economy have been hampered by recession in western
Europe, the collapse of traditional markets in the east, and the extra costs
arising from the break-up of Czechoslovakia. Rising protectionism in western
markets has been an additional handicap, though, apart from sensitive
sectors such as steel, the overall effect on the Czech economy of
restrictions on imports into the European Community have been exaggerated by
politicians. The Czech Republic has a trade surplus with the EC.
Industry is running below capacity, but this is due not simply to lack of
access to markets, but also to poor marketing skills and structures. Czech
industry also needs time and capital to modernise and improve product
quality.
The Industry Ministry recently warned that the lower quality and rising
costs of Czech products - at a time when recession and devaluations made
western European manufacturers more competitive - was causing a decline in
local demand. Officials fear that big companies such as Volkswagen, which is
currently going through fierce cost-cutting measures, could abandon plans to
develop local supplier networks for its Skoda venture in the Czech Republic
and turn to west European producers instead.
The staunchly free market government of the prime minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus,
has rejected calls for a devaluation to make Czech products more
competitive, saying companies must become more efficient. The government is
concerned that inflation and rapidly rising wages could undermine prospects
of recovery and frighten foreign investors, who invested more than Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) in the Czech territory in the three years before
Czechoslovakia split.
The average industrial wage has risen by more than 22 per cent compared with
a year ago - while productivity has stagnated - and Mr Klaus is determined
to bring wages under control. He says that Germany's economic success was
built on productivity growing faster than wages. Labour costs are still
about a tenth of those in Germany, but competition for investment from other
ex-communist countries is fierce. However, with unemployment at 148,600, or
2.8 per cent, the Klaus warning loses much of its impact. Prague has no
unemployment. Laid-off workers are absorbed in the city's bustling private
sector.
Extensive indebtedness is another problem. About a third of privatised
companies are believed to be technically bankrupt. Total inter-company debt
is estimated at about Kcs 150bn (Pounds 3.48bn). Since a new bankruptcy law
came into force in April there has been a steady trickle of official
bankruptcies, but its full effect has yet to be felt.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Five-year plan to boost jobs drafted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has finalised a five-year plan to fight unemployment
by reducing hiring costs while maintaining social benefits, the labour
ministry said yesterday.
Officials said the scheme would be the centrepiece of government strategy to
reduce unemployment, forecast to rise to 12.5 per cent by the end of the
year. But they would give no details before the formal announcement
tomorrow.
The plan is expected to include a timetable for the government to take over
from employers the social security charges for employees' families. The
government has already cut employers' payments for lowest paid workers and
is committed to doing away with them entirely.
The SMIC inflation-indexed minimum wage may also be modified. Many employers
and political commentators regard it as a principal cause of unemployment,
particularly among the young. The jobless rate for 18-25-year-olds is about
20 per cent, one of the highest in Europe.

FT  18 AUG 93 / French trim overnight rates again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France cut overnight rates for the third time in eight days
yesterday, continuing its strategy of gradually trimming borrowing costs in
the wake of the European currency crisis.
The cut came amid firm denials by French monetary officials that they were
seeking controls or taxes on foreign exchange flows as a means of curbing
speculation against the French currency.
The franc strengthened following yesterday's 0.5 percentage point cut in
24-hour borrowing rates to 8.75 per cent. It closed at FFr3.517 to the
D-Mark, up from FFr3.544 at Monday's close, but still nearly 10 centimes
below its previous European exchange rate mechanism floor rate of FFr3.4305.
The currency has stabilised since the end of the last week when revelation
of a substantial net deficit in the central bank's foreign exchange reserves
raised fears of a prolonged period of high interest rates.
These were compounded by comments by Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister,
that France would propose measures to curb speculation and stabilise the
international monetary system.
But French monetary officials said yesterday that the idea of reintroducing
capital controls was 'totally absurd'. Alternatives, such as taxing foreign
exchange transactions or requiring commercial banks to place funds with the
central bank to match overseas lending, were also dismissed.
'Restricting the freedom of capital movements would be a move in the
opposite direction to the one we want to pursue,' said one financial
official. France's objective of closer economic and financial integration
between EC countries would be undermined by restrictions on capital flows.
Yesterday's interest rate cut still leaves overnight borrowing rates above
their pre-crisis levels of 7.75 per cent. The 5-10 day borrowing rate,
suspended during the crisis and reintroduced at 10 per cent, was left
unchanged. The intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, has also
been left at 6.75 per cent since the crisis.

FT  18 AUG 93 / De Larosiere secure as president of EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France governor, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, will be named new
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development tomorrow.
The bank was set up in 1991 to make investments in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
The election process to replace Mr Jacques Attali, who quit last month amid
claims of extravagant spending at the EBRD, does not formally end till the
close of business today. However, Mr de Larosiere yesterday became the only
candidate when Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister,
withdrew.
However, an EBRD executive said the Frenchman had already secured enough
votes.
The bank is owned by 56 countries and international agencies. More than 50
per cent of its share capital is owned by the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries, which have voted for Mr de Larosiere. The successful
candidate needs a majority measured both by countries and by shares.
Mr Attali has returned to Paris where he is working from an office at the
conseil d'etat, which advises the French government on constitutional
issues.
One of Mr de Larosiere's first tasks will be to reassess the bank's mandate,
to determine whether it should invest a greater proportion of its capital in
the public sector and whether it should take greater risks.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Brussels to probe potash merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has started a detailed inquiry into the planned
merger of two potash producers in west and east Germany, which it fears
might create a monopoly.
The proposed merger is between the potash and rock salt business of Kali +
Salz, a subsidiary of BASF, and Mitteldeutschen Kali, an east German
producer being privatised by the Treuhand agency.
After a month-long investigation, the Commission has concluded that 'the
merging companies will have an extremely high combined market share or even
enjoy a monopoly with regard to the supply of potash products in Germany'.
The Treuhand, however, said the merger would reduce annual potash capacity
in Germany from more than 4m metric tonnes to 3.1m tonnes, and make the
industry more competitive.
'The aim of the merger is to secure as many jobs as possible, as well as
investments for the potash industry in eastern Germany, and at the same time
reduce capacity,' a Treuhand spokesman said.
Brussels now has four months to decide whether to let the merger through,
under vetting powers granted nearly three years ago. Since then, it has
blocked only one of 165 cases - the planned Franco-Italian takeover in 1991
of the Canadian aircraft-maker de Havilland.
But 11 cases have reached the 'in-depth investigation' stage now opening for
the German potash alliance. In seven instances, the companies involved have
been forced to alter the terms of their proposed merger, usually by
divesting assets, ending capital or contractual links between competitors,
and the cancellation of exclusive distribution arrangements. One Commission
official suggested yesterday that the terms of the Kali + Salz/MdK merger
might also have to be altered to win approval.
The Commission is also examining in parallel whether to authorise around
DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in state aids provided through the Treuhand to cement
the alliance, although it has generally treated state aid for the
restructuring of east German industry indulgently.

<TEXT>
TWO former managers of an eastern German savings bank went on trial in Halle
yesterday charged with misappropriation of funds in one of the biggest
financial scams in Germany since unification in 1990.
At the centre of the case is the Stadt und Saalkreissparkasse Halle, the
local savings bank, whose staff unwittingly granted more than DM400m (Pounds
160m) credits during the summer of 1990 to what one banker yesterday
described as 'cowboys'. At the time, eastern German banks were flush with
cash after millions of east Germans had cashed in their Ost Marks for
D-Marks.
To the young, unsuspecting east German staff at the savings bank the west
German businessmen who approached them for loans were beyond reproach. The
staff, untrained, inexperienced, and lacking a competent management, had
little idea of which credentials or collateral to ask for, despite the size
of the loans requested.
The Halle bank issued 10 loans to the west German businessmen, whose real
identities have never been established. They relied on the ubiquitous
Stempel - the rubber stamp - to establish their status. 'Letters' of
recommendation with the appropriate institutional stamps were enough to
persuade the staff to part with DM400m.
'This is an unfortunate case,' said Mr Harmut Forndran, an official at the
German savings banks' association. 'It took place just after monetary union.
There was no infrastructure in the eastern German banking system. No
management.'
Since late 1990, west German banks have introduced training courses, western
managers sit on most of the eastern German bank boards, and the chances for
scams - at least across the counter - are rare.
The authorities have managed to recover DM170m. 'The rest of it is probably
outside the country,' said Mr Forndran.

THE Georgian authorities said yesterday they had arrested the man who shot
US diplomat Fred Woodruff earlier this month, but described his death as a
'chance killing', Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
'The crime has been solved. The criminal has been identified, the
investigation is proceeding, and we expect him to go on trial,' the first
deputy interior minister, Mr Mikhail Osadze, said on radio.
Mr Woodruff, who according to unconfirmed US press reports was working for
the Central Intelligence Agency, was killed with a single bullet to the head
on August 8 while travelling in a car with Georgian leader Eduard
Shevardnadze's security chief.
Mr Osadze, speaking to Reuter by telephone, said the unnamed suspect had
apparently fired in an attempt to stop the car in which Mr Woodruff was
travelling, but had not intended to kill any of the passengers.

FT  18 AUG 93 / DM500m diesel engine plant for Opel: GM agrees investment
after unions back 'lean' working methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS is to invest DM500m (Pounds 200m) to build a new range of
diesel engines at its main Opel engine plant at Kaiserslautern, Germany,
after winning agreement from the trade unions on a package of far-reaching
labour reforms at the plant.
The US carmaker has chosen to locate the plant in Germany despite the burden
of German labour costs, the highest in the world motor vehicle industry.
Mr David Herman, chairman of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said that the
group had decided on Kaiserslautern, because of progress it had made in
introducing streamlined 'lean' production methods at the plant.
It has won agreement for team working and the integration of production and
maintenance work.
The diesel engine plant will operate for 24 hours a day and five days a week
and will continue running through rest periods. Shift changes will be
achieved without any break of production, and preventive maintenance will be
performed as part of normal working time on Saturdays without payment of any
overtime premium.
Opel is cutting layers of management at the plant from five to four and the
works council has agreed to work to lower absenteeism to 'an internationally
competitive level' of less than 5 per cent. Opel suffers absenteeism of
around 9 per cent at its Bochum and Russelsheim plants in Germany.
The company said it believed that with the new labour agreement 'competitive
manufacturing will also continue to be possible in Germany'. The choice of
Kaiserslautern was a commitment by Opel to Germany 'as an industrial
location', said Mr Herman.
The plant will have a capacity to produce 250,000 engines a year with
production starting at the end of 1995. It will employ 475 people at full
capacity and will help to slow the fall in the Opel workforce at the site.
GM (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) urgently needs a
modern diesel power unit for its European car range.
It has fallen behind several of its main rivals, including Volkswagen and
Peugeot, in the provision of competitive diesel engines at a time when
diesels are rapidly growing in popularity. It was forced yesterday to cut
the prices of its 1.7 litre Vectra and Astra diesel cars in Germany by
DM1,000 per car to try to bolster sales.

FT  18 AUG 93 / British Gas may lose monopoly on household supply: MMC
recommends sale of trading arm; Higher prices threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS could eventually lose its monopoly to supply gas to 18m
households and be forced to sell its trading activities if the government
adopts recommendations made yesterday by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The commission proposed a nine-year timetable for the introduction of
competition to the gas market.
Its recommendations were more far-reaching than had been expected. If
accepted by the government, they would lead to the largest corporate
break-up ever seen in the UK, and bring about a transformation of gas
transport and supply.
The introduction of full competition in household gas supply would mean
Britain going further than any other country, including the US, in freeing
up the market for domestic users. Consumer groups warned the changes could
lead to higher prices.
The commission's main proposals were:
Divestment of British Gas's trading arm by the end of March 1997. That would
leave the company to concentrate on gas transport and storage.
Reducing its monopoly to include only customers using less than 1,500 therms
of gas a year - most domestic customers - on March 31 1997, with removal of
the entire monopoly three to five years later.
Setting a rate of return for its pipelines operations of 4 per cent to 4.5
per cent on assets.
Reducing its pricing formula for household customers to 4 percentage points
below the rate of inflation, from the present 5 points.
British Gas, which was privatised in 1986, said the proposals would result
in the loss of at least 20,000 jobs at the company and keep its profits
below levels achieved in recent years.
But the City pushed the company's share price up 4p to 328p as it welcomed
the removal of some of the uncertainty surrounding the industry for the past
year. Shares also rose after British Gas said its pre-tax profits in the
second quarter would not be less than Pounds 503m.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said the recommendations
would allow the company to plan ahead with greater certainty. But they would
place British Gas under financial strain and force a review of its
investment programme.
Mr Graeme Odgers, chairman of the commission, said the proposals would
introduce competition to the gas industry in a controlled way, bring
'considerable benefits' for consumers, 'avoid problems on safety' and
'ensure appropriate regulation'.
But the commission angered consumer organisations by recommending that
consumers bear the cost of the proposed changes on the grounds that the
development of competition will benefit them in the long run. Mr James
Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, said: 'If these
recommendations are implemented it appears that large numbers of domestic
customers will pay more for their gas.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will have to decide
whether to adopt the commission's recommendations. The government may shy
away from some of the changes because they could lead to higher prices for
domestic customers and would come in the wake of the furore over VAT on
domestic fuel bills. Mr Neil Hamilton, consumer affairs minister, said
yesterday the government had not reached a view on the commission's
findings.
But Ofgas, the industry regulator, said it believed the commission had been
'overly cautious'. Ofgas and many of British Gas's rivals, which supply
industrial customers, would like to see the gas market freed up at the
sametime as the supply of electricity is scheduled to be freed in 1998.
The monopolies inquiry was called a year ago after a series of rows between
British Gas and its regulator. Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, wanted the
commission to set a rate of return that British Gas should be allowed to
earn from its pipelines operations.
Mr Brown, however, asked for a full review of the company's activities.
British Gas was last subject to an MMC investigation in 1988, when
competition in the industrial supply market had been slow to develop since
privatisation.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Chance to shop around by 2002
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL household gas consumers will be able to shop around for their supplies
by the year 2002 if ministers accept the MMC's recommendation to abolish
British Gas's hold over the market.
They are likely to be bombarded with offers to supply their homes from among
more than 30 companies competing in the new deregulated market.
Packages could be as varied as mortgages. These could include long-term,
fixed-rate contracts.
Exact arrangements for the new system have still to be worked out - the
government has yet to approve the recommendations to open the household
market fully to competition. But a free market in gas might work as follows.
In March 2002, the Jones household in North London might get an offer from a
newly formed company in, say, Manchester to supply them more cheaply than
British Gas's supply business (which by then is likely to be a separate
company anyway).
The Joneses choose the package they want and sign up with the new company.
This will not involve changes to the pipes or meters in their home which
will probably continue to be administered by British Gas's distribution
business.
The new company will supply the Joneses with gas pumped through the pipeline
network which will still be owned by British Gas. They will then charge the
Joneses.
In this new world, it would even be technically possible for the Joneses to
sign up with two suppliers which offer better prices at different times of
the day. New electronic meters are being developed to measure consumption at
short intervals, and they will be fitted with radio signalling so that they
can be read from a distance.
However, daily or even weekly changes of supplier were considered extremely
unlikely by gas companies yesterday. 'Some people will shop around,' said Mr
Stephen Gutteridge, chairman of Southern Gas. 'But I would expect most
contracts will be for about a year.'
Mr Malcolm Faulkner, chairman of Northern Gas, said daily settlements of
bills would be too costly to administer. Monthly contracts were possible.
'Some people may want to sign up for long agreements if they think it will
give them a better deal,' he said. 'It would be similar to taking out a
fixed rate mortgage.'
Northern and Southern Gas are arms of the regional electricity companies and
were set up to take advantage of the likely deregulation of the gas market.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Improved public borrowing figure boosts UK markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S public sector deficit was a lower-than-expected Pounds 1.55bn in
July, but neither the Treasury nor Downing Street were ready yesterday to
revise downwards the government's forecast of a Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement for the current financial year.
Yesterday's official borrowing figures helped to boost sterling and lift
government bond prices and equities to record highs as investors reasoned
that the government might now be under less pressure to raise taxes in its
November Budget.
But a Treasury spokesman said it was still too soon in the financial year to
think of revising down the deficit forecast. Downing Street officials
cautioned against treating the July PSBR figure as a sign that there was now
less pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut spending or raise
new revenues.
While several City analysts said that they now expected the 1993-94 deficit
would be less than the government's forecast, they also cautioned against
euphoria.
'The data so far this year do not yet point to a sizeable PSBR undershoot,'
said Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in
London. He said he was sticking with his forecast of a Pounds 48.5bn PSBR
for this financial year.
Financial markets had been expecting a reduced deficit of about Pounds 1.9bn
last month following June's Pounds 3.97bn shortfall between government
expenditure and revenues. The July 1992 PSBR amounted to Pounds 656m.
July is traditionally a strong month for government tax receipts because of
payments by the self employed and of advance corporation tax. Government
income was also boosted last month by Pounds 1.8bn in proceeds from the BT3
share sale.
But figures released yesterday by the Treasury showed that government cash
receipts were up only 4 per cent to Pounds 66.8bn in the first four months
of 1993-94 compared with the same period last year.
Cash outlays were up 7.5 per cent to Pounds 81bn. The Treasury reported that
the cumulative PSBR in the first four months of this financial year reached
Pounds 14.9bn compared with Pounds 11.4bn in the April to July period of
1992. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR for April to July rose to
Pounds 18.2bn compared with Pounds 14.8bn in the same period of last year.
The pound closed in London at DM2.5225 yesterday, a gain of 2 pfennigs on
the day. Part of its strength reflected profit taking in the D-mark and
expectations of favourable news about UK retail price inflation today. The
FT-SE 100 index closed up 16.7 at 3,025.

FT  18 AUG 93 / Labour levy would enforce training guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would impose a levy of up to 1.5 per cent of payroll
costs on companies which failed to comply with training guidelines, Mr
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
The levy, intended to help pay for upgrading government training programmes,
compares with earlier plans for a maximum levy of 0.5 per cent on all
companies not spending that amount.
The revised proposal emerged in a paper for Labour's annual conference next
month, in which Mr Brown further distances the party from the
higher-taxation manifesto on which it fought the 1992 general election.
Promising to cut taxes 'if I can', Mr Brown confirmed the Labour
leadership's determination to discard the party's redistributionist image.
'Labour is not against wealth, nor will we seek to penalise it,' he said.
Mr Brown said the revised training proposals were aimed at encouraging
companies to develop their own training programmes, rather than rely on the
government.
'There are a large number of companies which are failing to make the
training investment which is necessary. That is not only harming the country
as a whole, it is harming those companies which are prepared to make the
investment because they are finding that their trained workers are being
poached,' he said.
The revised proposal is based on similar schemes operating in France,
Australia and New Zealand. Labour officials are believed to have concluded
that the amount raised through the original scheme would have been
insufficient to finance a worthwhile training programme.
The proposal was dismissed as a 'distraction' by the Confederation of
British Industry, which said spending on training had been rising since
1989, despite the recession.
'Government regulation of this kind would just lead to a reclassification of
existing activities as companies tried to comply with the rules,' said Mr
Tony Webb, CBI training director. 'What we need is a focus on increasing
training through cultural change, not an artificial scheme requiring a set
level of spending.'
Mr Brown presented the training levy as a key component of Labour's revised
economic strategy, unveiled last month, which focuses on increasing
investment and competition.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the treasury, said Labour's
policy document was full of 'platitudinous' rubbish. 'It is just silly,
particularly for the Labour party, to go round talking about tax cuts at the
moment,' he said.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Abbey sells estate agency chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL is selling its 347-branch Cornerstone estate agency chain for
less than one-tenth of the price per outlet paid by many buyers in the late
1980s.
The sale will end a six-year venture into estate agency which has cost the
UK bank an estimated Pounds 258m (Dollars 384m).
Abbey is selling Cornerstone for Pounds 8m to two chartered surveyors who
are backed by Provident Life, the life insurance company. The deal will
create the UK's largest independently-owned chain of estate agents.
The sale price is equal to Pounds 23,000 per agency, against about Pounds
250,000 per branch paid in the housing boom of the late 1980s as mortgage
lenders and life companies competed to build up distribution arms.
Abbey will still operate mortgage selling units in 50 of the Cornerstone
branches.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Nigeria's government proscribes newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government yesterday proscribed newspapers shut last
month, including one owned by Chief Moshood Abiola, victorious candidate in
the June presidential poll which was subsequently annulled by General
Ibrahim Babangida.
Mr Abiola, interviewed in London, condemned the action, saying: 'This is
just the beginning of a new darknes of a type Nigerians never believed they
deserved. Babangida has signalled to the world that consent no longer forms
any part of the code of government.'
The decree outlaws newspapers published by the Concord group, owned by Mr
Abiola, as well as those of Punch, the Daily Sketch and Bendel Newspaper
Corporation.
The government closed the publications on July 22 in the biggest press
clampdown since independence in 1960, accusing the papers of bias.
General Babangida postponed a speech to the National Assembly yesterday, and
is expected to give details of his proposed interim government today, his
52nd birthday. Yesterday's clampdown on the press reinforced widespread
doubts that he will hand effective power to the new administration.
Lagos re-opened for business yesterday after a three-day mass stay-at-home
protest, which left the city deserted from Thursday to Saturday. The
Campaign for Democracy, which organised the protest, promised more action,
saying that 'the struggle to terminate military dictatorship from our land
has just begun and to that extent no amount of intimidation  ..victimisation
and oppression can stop the on-going people's march towards democracy.'
Thousands of people are fleeing the cities, particularly in the south-west,
Mr Abiola's political strongold.
'As we get nearer the fateful 27th of August, the spate of flight has
escalated,' the Lagos Guardian newspaper said in an editorial.
'The climate of fear is exacerbated by widespread rumours of large caches of
arms discovered in different parts of the country, of communities
determinedly arming themselves,' it added.

A KUWAITI trade union yesterday accused manpower companies of ill-treating

'These companies have greatly damaged Kuwait's image abroad through their
continuous violations of labour laws and their inhuman practices including
trading in humans,' the Union of Oil and Petrochemical Industry Workers
said.
Hundreds of manpower companies provide foreign labour to state-owned
corporations such as oil companies.
Two thousand foreigners employed by a local manpower company went on a
rampage during a one-day strike earlier this month, overturning cars and
smashing up rooms at the Kuwait National Petroleum's Mina Abdulla refinery.
The workers, mainly Indians and Bangladeshis, complained of bad food and
living conditions and irregular wage payments.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Tensions hamper Greek investment in Albania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE the Gjirokaster tannery in southern Albania's north Epirus region,
local farmers are disputing the offering price for sheep hides. Inside,
Greek technicians are installing an automated production line for making
shoes.
Mr Spiros Lilis, the deputy manager, says a year-long delay in starting up
the Dr2.5bn (Dollars 10m) joint venture between a leading Greek leather
manufacturer and the Albanian state, the country's largest single foreign
investment to date, is due more to bureaucracy than to political tensions
between Greece and Albania.
'It took months to work out an exemption from the 30 per cent import tax on
new machinery, on the grounds that we'll be exporting most of our output,'
he said. 'But we demonstrated our commitment to the project by paying the
workforce during that time.'
Close to the tannery, three joint ventures making clothes for export occupy
what was a state-owned textile factory. The 1,200 workers employed there
earn Dollars 60 a month, double the average Albanian wage but only a
fraction of that in Greece.
'Our Irish partner provided the sewing machines, the Greek partner sends
ready-cut fabric for sewing and the French partner organises the marketing,'
said Mr Konstandin Caro of Gjirotext, the largest manufacturer.
Still, the revived dispute between the Greek and Albanian governments over
the region, where much of the population is of ethnic Greek descent, is
damaging its chances of leading Albania out of dire poverty with a steady
flow of Greek investment.
Albania's expulsion last month of a Greek priest accused of promoting
nationalism provoked violent demonstrations in Gjirokaster. Greece responded
by deporting more than 30,000 of an estimated 200,000 Albanian immigrants
who mainly work in the flourishing black economy.
Albanian fears that Greece still covets the region, where Greek troops set
up a shortlived protectorate in 1914, have been rekindled, reflecting both
the emergence of a strong nationalist faction in Greece's governing
conservative party and concern that the war in Bosnia may spread to the
southern Balkans.
Such anxieties were heightened when Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek
prime minister, recently raised the issue of autonomy for north Epirus
within Albania.
The Greeks worry that the Albanian government, growing authoritarian, will
step up discrimination against the ethnic Greek minority. Its leaders have
already claimed they face obstacles in getting permission for Greek to be
taught in schools, as well as in bidding for property and businesses being
sold under Albania's privatisation programme.
'Greek businessmen are definitely more hesitant about investing in southern
Albania because of the worsened political climate,' says Mr Yiannis Tzen,
who is in charge of the Greek Economy Ministry's programme for investing
there.
About 70 Greek-Albanian joint ventures have been set up since Greece's
investment incentives law was extended last year to include southern
Albania, creating about 12,000 jobs there, according to the ministry. So far
this year, the government has provided Dollars 1.1bn in grants for 35
projects.

FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a weak drinks sector. Whitbread lost further ground as NatWest Securities
reiterated its negative stance on the stock. The 'A' shares have fallen from
533p on Friday to close yesterday at 499p, down 10 on the day.
Mr Geoff Collyer, drinks analyst at NatWest, said concern persisted over the
damage being done to revenues by supermarkets switching from domestic to
Continental suppliers. He added that because Whitbread was standing at a 10
per cent premium to the sector, investors looking to take profits should
consider the stock an obvious candidate.
Following firm results on Friday, Unilever stormed ahead by 20 to 1006p,
helped by a strong 'buy' note from Strauss Turnbull. The broker pointed out
that, as well as positive results, the stock has significantly
underperformed the market this year.
Among food retailers, Tesco responded to some healthy weekend press comment
that the shares looked oversold. They climbed 9 1/2 to 233p. A brighter
outlook for the discount end of the market was also being commented on.
Shoprite Group added 5 at 159p and Kwik Save 6 at 688p.
Among stores, results from Argos were accompanied by a cautious statement
and the shares drifted back 10 to 328p. The stock had raced ahead prior to
the figures and, in the absence of anything startling, dealers said it was
due for a correction.
Another stock to enjoy a good run, Sears, also encountered profit-taking and
eased 2 to 111 1/2 p, with NatWest Securities negative. Although positive on
the sector in the short term, the broker is also cautious on Boots, a penny
softer at 474p, and WH Smith, 3 off at 469p.
HSBC was the pick of a generally strong banking sector, the shares building
on their recent strong performance and pushing up to touch a record 769p,
before closing a net 10 ahead at 766p. Dealers said the big international
institutions had continued to chase the shares because of the recent strong
profits performance from Standard Chartered and the outstanding prospects
for the Pacific Rim area. HSBC is scheduled to announce interim figures on
August 31.
Abbey National's decision to sell its Cornerstone estate agency business for
Pounds 8m, involving the bank in a write-down of Pounds 30m in its second
half, saw Abbey shares only marginally affected and finally a penny down at
400p xd.
The burst of buying interest that drove British Gas shares sharply higher
last week, amid suggestions that today's Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report into the gas supply and transport industry will not recommend a
break-up of Gas, foundered yesterday as nervous fund managers locked in some
of the profits garnered in the past couple of months.
British Gas ended 9 lower at 323 1/2 p on what one energy specialist
described as disappointing turnover of 8m. 'The market does not really care
about anything else other than the company's ability to pay the dividend and
its ability to increase that payment,' said an analyst.
BP failed to respond to reports of a major drilling success in Vietnam, the
shares settling unchanged at 303 1/2 p ex-dividend. 'The Vietnam stories are
old news,' said one specialist. Shell Transport edged up 2 1/2 to 663p.
Enterprise Oil, whose shares were given a mauling by the market last week
after news of the resignation of Mr John Walmsley and also following a
bearish review of the company by Hoare Govett, staged a rally and finished
13 better at 442p.
Aran Energy eged up half-penny to 34p on relatively heavy turnover of 1.5m,
with speculators said to be increasingly optimistic about the group's
drilling operations in the Celtic Sea.
Fears that British Aerospace's negotiations with Taiwan over their regional
jets joint venture may be facing difficulties weakened BAe. The shares
dipped 5 to 453p.
Overseas buyers were seen late in the session for aero-engine manufacturer
Rolls- Royce. Earlier the company said it had sold stock, believed to be
around 6.7m shares, to reduce the level of foreign ownership, which had
exceeded 29.5 per cent, the level permitted under the company's articles of
association. Having declined to 158p, the shares picked up to close 1 1/2
off on balance at 160 1/2 p.
Nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's figures saw BICC relinquish 16 to 397p.
There was some talk of a possible rights issue but it was discounted by
several analysts. Profits are expected to come in at around Pounds 53m,
against Pounds 58m last year.

FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: MB-Caradon strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building materials and printing group MB-Caradon rose sharply after
confirmation that it was in talks with RTZ, the international mining and
metals group, over the possible sale of RTZ's Pillar building and electrical
products unit.
Weekend press reports suggested that RTZ was looking to sell Pillar for
around Pounds 750m, and an early morning statement yesterday confirmed that
the two groups were in discussions. MB-Caradon advanced 16 to 303p in active
trade of 3.5m. RTZ firmed a penny to 687p in light volume.
The market has been eagerly waiting to see how MB-Caradon would use the
proceeds from the sale earlier this year of its stake in Carnaud Metalbox,
the French packaging group, although fears of a rights issue to help finance
an acquisition remain.
Mr Robert Donald at NatWest Securities said he thought there would be a deal
with RTZ, but cautioned: 'The key question is, will it be sufficiently
earnings enhancing to justify the share price, and for that to happen it
needs to acquire Pounds 1.25 of sales for every Pounds 1 it invests.'

FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BT lifted by AT&amp;T move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dramatic news from across the Atlantic of AT&amp;T's new moves in its plan
to buy McCaw Cellular Communications had repercussions throughout the
telecoms sector on the London market yesterday. AT&amp;T, which was to buy a
part-stake in McCaw last year, decided to change its takeover timetable,
delaying the purchase of the 17 per cent shareholding held by BT, but paying
a healthy premium for doing so to the UK company.
BT will now take its settlement in AT&amp;T shares, receiving 35.8m shares in a
one-for-one exchange with McCaw stock. At the current AT&amp;T share price of
Dollars 62.375, BT's holding is valued at approximately Dollars 2.2bn. Under
the previous agreement, BT would have received Dollars 1.75bn in cash.
'The increase in the amount that BT has raised is to a certain extent offset
by the risk that AT&amp;T shares could fall. But on balance, this looks like a
modest positive for BT,' said Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett. He added that he
expected BT to sell its stake around November next year.
With the total bid for McCaw valued at Dollars 12.4bn, excitement among
London telecoms analysts centred on the price this now put on other cellular
groups. Vodafone, which had seen its price fall sharply at the opening
yesterday, recovered quickly after the early afternoon announcement and
ended the day 9 ahead at 531p.
Dealers said marketmakers were also caught short by the day's events.
Rumours circulating the London market in recent weeks of a big bid in the
telecoms sector were also given fresh currency.
However, Cable and Wireless slipped back 8 to 834p on the contrary argument
that AT&amp;T's extra payment to BT made a new bid in the sector unlikely. BT,
which went ex-dividend by 9.45p yesterday, closed 6 up at 429p.

FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices dip as the market closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market ended the first session of the new three-week trading
account relatively unscathed in spite of a bout of nervousness triggered
largely by a flurry of selling in the German bond market and a modest
decline in UK gilts late in the session.
A faltering equity market was bolstered by a strong opening performance on
Wall Street, which was around 20 points higher shortly after it commenced
trading, stimulated by takeover activity in the telecoms sector and better
than expected capacity utilisation numbers.
At the close of trading the FT-SE 100 Index showed a 1.8 net decline at
3,008.3. Turnover in equities remained at relatively high levels. Some 604m
shares changed hands yesterday, with the lion's share, almost 400m shares,
or 66 per cent, accounted for by trading in non-FT-SE 100 shares.
The market began the day in subdued fashion, with ex-dividend allowances
accounting for a fall of almost nine Footsie points at the outset of
trading.
However, the early downside trend, which took the market down to 3,002.0
shortly after trading commenced, proved short-lived and prices began to edge
higher in line with the Footsie future and following renewed keen support
for selected issues, notably the electricity and water stocks, which offer
well above average yields.
The market reached the day's high point, up 6.5 at 3,016.6, in mid-morning
before running out of steam and marking time ahead of the opening of Wall
Street.
The US market came in on a firm note, with interest stimulated by news of
AT&amp;T's move to acquire McCaw, the cellular telephones group, and a better
than expected figure on capacity utilisation during July. The July figure
for industrial output was in line with expectations, according to dealers.
However, downside pressure on German bonds and to a lesser extent on UK
gilts began to unnerve the UK equity market, which receded into negative
territory in mid-afternoon.
Dealers in the equity market were mostly unperturbed by events yesterday,
taking the view that intermittent bouts of selling pressure had enabled
marketmakers to fill in many of the hefty short positions that have built up
in recent weeks as the big push drove the FT-SE 100 Index through the 3,000
level.
'The market is now better balanced than it has been for some time and will
not go down too far as long as Wall Street performs,' said a leading
institutional salesman. He warned, however, that the market remained
unforgiving towards companies whose results do not come up to the market's
best expectations. Argos was a case in point yesterday, the shares sliding
in spite of middle of the range profits.
Senior marketmakers adopted a fairly bullish view of the market, saying that
much of the late pressure in equities was triggered by the Footsie future,
which ran into strong resistance at the 3,030 level. 'There was very little
pressure in the cash market,' said one.
Mr Peter Thorne, equity strategist at Nikko Securities, warned that in the
short term the news flow will not be positive for equities. 'We expect
further evidence of slow economic growth in the UK and US; further earnings
disappointments; a tax-raising budget in November; and concerns that
inflation will rise in 1994.'

FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET opening to the new account saw turnover in the derivatives markets
slip back in directionless trading, writes Christopher Price.
However, business in the September FT-SE contract opened lively enough, with
traders half expecting another rousing session. The contract, having opened
at 3,020, was bought up to challenge the 3,030 level which has proved a
resistance point in the post-3,000 era. Dealers said the rise was even more
impressive given the 10 or so points that were taken out of the index
because of the number of stocks going ex-dividend.
Despite this, turnover was thin with few of the large institutions visible.
September thus began to drift off towards mid-day, although there was enough
buying interest to sustain the contract above the 3,020-level.
Another rally took the contract up to 3,031, its high of the day before
again falling back. A strong Wall Street failed to inspire any further
attempt, offset by weak gilts and a general lack of events for dealers to
focus on.
A late dip saw September close at 3,013, just five points above the cash
market. Volume was 5,727 contracts.
In traded options, turnover reached 20,873 contracts, Among the stock
options, Tesco, heavily tipped in the weekend press, led the way with 1,298
contracts. Amstrad, British Steel and Grand Metropolitan were also
prominent.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow peaks as telecoms deal
lifts sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices closed just short of record highs yesterday as market
sentiment was boosted by news of a multi-billion-dollar merger in the
telecommunications industry, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.50 at 3,579.15 after climbing
above 3,590 at midsession. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended a net 2.24 stronger at 452.38, while the American SE composite gained
2.25 at 441.33. The Nasdaq composite reached a record 726.89 with a rise of
8.63. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 233.6m shares.
Although equity prices declined at the opening, the fall was a reflection of
the impact of dividend payouts on several Dow stocks. Once that had been
digested, prices quickly began to climb across the board, aided by further
declines in bond yields.
The day's big story was the news that AT&amp;T was to buy all of McCaw Cellular
Communications in a stock-swap worth Dollars 12.6bn. Although the
development was not totally unexpected - AT&amp;T already owns a significant
stake in McCaw - the arrival of a huge corporate transaction was welcomed by
equity investors.
AT&amp;T fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 on the news, while McCaw jumped
Dollars 5 to Dollars 56 1/4 in volume of more than 7.4m shares on the Nasdaq
market. Lin Broadcasting, a cellular operator majority-owned by McCaw,
forged ahead Dollars 12 3/4 to Dollars 115.
Overall, prices may also have been supported by the day's economic news,
which consisted of a 0.4 per cent rise in July industrial production and a
small increase in capacity utilisation from 81.3 per cent to 81.5 per cent.
Salomon advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 48 after Mr Warren Buffett, the
billionaire investor and former Salomon chairman, notified the government
authorities that he planned to take his stake in the company, currently at
14.3 per cent, over the 15 per cent mark. Analysts said the move was a vote
of confidence in Salomon.
Aluminum Company of America led blue chips higher, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 73 7/8 in busy trading. Other metals stocks, especially gold
companies, were also firmer, with Newmont Mining putting on Dollars 1 at
Dollars 48 7/8 and Battle Mountain Gold Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 9 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, Snapple Beverage climbed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 43
3/4 after declaring a two-for-one stock split as a 100 per cent dividend.
Canada
TORONTO finished narrowly mixed after light trading. The TSE 300 index was
finally 5.6 firmer at 4,020.2 but declining issues slightly exceeded rises
by 341 to 339. Volume was 43.6m shares valued at CDollars 450.9m. Seven of
the 14 sub-group indices closed lower, led by real estate, off 1.1 per cent.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Opposing influences move
Frankfurt bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
THERE was a sense of hiatus among senior bourses yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff, with Paris, Madrid and Brussels closed for the Assumption Day
holiday.
FRANKFURT fell back from early morning highs, the DAX index closing 5.61
higher at 1,912.19, after an early intraday peak of 1,931.38 and a gain of 2
per cent last week. Brokers said that there were some large buy orders in
the pre-bourse, but no positive follow-through thereafter.
Turnover fell from DM9.4bn to DM7.8bn. In the post-bourse, the
Ibis-indicated DAX fell to 1,903.51.
Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, at James Capel in Frankfurt, said that investors were
torn between thoughts of consolidation - the DAX having risen by 300 points
in less than three months - and the temptation to begin speculation on a
further reduction in interest rates when the Bundesbank meets on Thursday
week.
Meanwhile, blue chips saw Siemens rise DM8.60 to DM684.60, having lagged
behind the market recently.
In chemicals, Hoechst put on DM2.80m to DM279.80 for similar reasons; among
carmakers, a DM7.30 drop in Volkswagen to DM392.30, weighed down by
industrial spying allegations, was offset by a DM13 rise to DM716.50 at
Daimler.
Initial interest in the department store retailer, Karstadt, took it up to
DM623 at midday before it closed a modest DM3.20 higher at DM608.00
following confirmation of discussions on warehousing and distribution
logistics with its competitor, Hertie.
In contrast, Germany's second largest department store chain, Kaufhof, fell
DM16 to DM549 on switch considerations.
Meanwhile, Lufthansa continued its climb, rising DM3.20 to DM151.50 after
its management board chairman, Mr Jurgen Weber, said that the airline would
resume paying a dividend by 1995 at the latest.
ZURICH went higher following bearish James Capel notes on both fundamental
and technical grounds, the SMI index rising 17.9 to 2,478.9.
Dealers said that profit-taking was always likely and that international
investors could shift funds into more promising markets like Germany.
However, the market was drawn higher by Nestle, up SFr19 at SFr1,099, and
Roche, with the certificates SFr90 higher at SFr5,120.
AMSTERDAM closed unchanged in spite of some convincing gains by leading
multinational groups such as Unilever, up Fl 2.90 at Fl 193.40, and Royal
Dutch, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 187.40. The CBS Tendency index finished at 127.9.
Among second liners, Frans Maas, the road transport group, shed Fl 7.30 to
Fl 49.00 on news over the weekend that it is now forecasting lower than
expected results this year.
KLM, which has a stake in the group, came off 50 cents to Fl 36.70. Among
other stocks in the transport sector, Nedlloyd lost 80 cents to Fl 47.30
ahead of results due later this month.
MILAN saw a heavy reverse in Ferruzzi ordinary shares after Friday's 20 per
cent gain, closing down L86.20 at L242.00. Analysts remarked that dealing in
the stock was now driven by the speculative activity of small investors and,
as such, liable to sudden swings.
On the last day of the account, the Comit index rose 4.07 to 593.04.
Montedison rose again on last week's results, by L34 to L772.50. Yesterday a
court said that it had postponed until the end of the month a decision on
whether to allow a request by the company for the seizure of L500bn of
assets from ex-managers.
In Scandinavia, STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index eased on
profit-taking, down 8.3 at 1,285.0 with Ericsson B shares losing SKr6 to
SKr372 ahead of Thursday's half year results.
OSLO, in similar vein, saw the all-share index off 4.14 at 586.94 in
turnover of NKr606m.
HELSINKI closed lower also on the profit-taking theme, the HEX index down
13.4 to 1,427.9, with the banking sector off some 5 per cent.
VIENNA traders said that the expiry of August derivatives added uncertainty
to a market in correction as the ATX index eased 11.01 to 989.63. The August
ATX future eased 15 to 986.
ISTANBUL gained 4.7 per cent and broke above 10,000 for first time since
August 3. The composite index put on 458.51 to 10,199.7, following a rise of
2 per cent on Friday.
Some market observers said that the recently positive tone might be due to
the expectation of fresh liquidity following the maturity of Treasury bills
early next month.
WARSAW saw as 12 shares hit record highs, the bourse posting its second
highest ever turnover of 619.5bn zloty (Dollars 34m) as the WIG index gained
240.8, or 4.6 per cent to 5,492.4.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Norway, Finland lead European markets

<TEXT>
Scandinavian equity markets showed impressive performances last week, with
Norway and Finland in particular standing out.
In spite of losses in Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Hong Kong,
strength elsewhere left the FT-Actuaries world index up 1 per cent in local
currency terms.
Norway and Finland have both been lifted recently by sharp cuts in domestic
interest rates: as a result Oslo's all-share index put on 8 per cent over
the week and Helsinki's Hex index added 4 per cent.
Mr Peter Tron, senior manager at Unibank Securities in London, said that
there was noticeable evidence of foreign liquidity driving the Norwegian
market last week, while the strength of the dollar also helped lift
sentiment. Finland, he added, witnessed another base rate cut and investors
remained confident about the prospect for corporate earnings following the
depreciation of the Finnish markka.
In Sweden, results from SKF, which came in better than expectations, helped
to restore confidence. A rate cut on Thursday also contributed to the
Affarsvarlden index's 3.5 per cent weekly gain.
Denmark, of all the Scandinavian markets, remarked Mr Tron, shows the
greatest potential for earnings growth, having so far done little to reduce
interest rates since the realignment of the ERM.
He forecast a 20 per cent upside in the market's all-share index by the end
of the year, coinciding with a cut in short-term interest rates from the
present 12.8 per cent to 4.75 per cent by the middle of 1994.
Among other global equity markets, Mexico pulled back some of its losses
earlier in the week on Friday on news that a satisfactory conclusion had
been reached in negotiations on side accords to the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
New Zealand, still a strong performer over the year to date, suffered from
weakness in Telecom shares.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul rebounds as
Pacific Rim sees more new highs

WORRIES over last week's announcement of mounting Cosmo Securities debts,
due to irregular transactions, had much less of an impact on Japanese
equities in the broader Tokyo market yesterday than they did in London last
Friday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
In fact, the 225-issue Nikkei average ignored Friday's after-hours' fall of
nearly 1 per cent in the ISE/Nikkei 50 index in London; hopes of an imminent
cut in the official discount rate prompted arbitrage-linked buying and the
Nikkei gained 156.32 at 20,901.49.
The Nikkei registered a day's low of 20,548.85 just after the opening, but
selling ran its course during the morning session. A rise in the fut-ures
market on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange triggered arbitrage
buying, pushing the index forward to register a day's high of 20,904.69 in
the late afternoon.
Volume contracted to 230m shares from 482m. Aside from arbitrageurs,
investment trusts and dealers were seen buying in small lots. Advances
outnumbered declines by 550 to 396, with 209 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks finished 4.96 ahead at a 1993 peak of
1,688.04, and London's ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 1.83 to 1,286.26.
Investors were calm over the revelations of Cosmo Securities' losses of
Y69.8bn resulting from its involvement in tobashi, the shuffling of
investors' accounts in order to hide unrealised losses. Daiwa Bank said last
Friday that it will rescue Cosmo by injecting Y70bn to Y80bn through a third
party share allotment.
The yen's rise to a further record high worried some investors as the dollar
closed Y1.15 down at Y101.25. However, the Bank of Japan's money market
operations fuelled speculation of an early discount rate cut. Mr Geoffrey
Barker, an economist at Baring Securities, pointed out that five out of six
discount rate cuts since 1991 were preceded by generous infusions of funds
by the central bank into the money markets.
Brokers were hit by the Cosmo debacle. Nomura Securities slipped Y20 to
Y2,200, second tier brokers such as Sanyo Securities lost Y25 to Y720 and
New Japan Securities declined Y19 to Y694. Trading in Cosmo Securities was
suspended for the day.
The higher yen supported oil refiners. Koa Oil jumped Y109 to Y1,030 and
Mitsubishi Oil gained Y10 at Y1,080. However, export-oriented consumer
electronics makers lost ground, with Matsushita Electric Industrial easing
Y10 to Y1,360 and Sony Y10 to Y4,370.
In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 27.19 to 22,772.20 in volume of 20.4m
shares. Dealer buying supported retail and machinery shares. However,
Nintendo, the video game maker, retreated Y190 to Y9,410 on the higher yen.
Roundup
MORE NEW highs were recorded on the Pacific Rim, while South Korean equities
rebounded after last week's losses.
SEOUL, which fell 4.5 per cent last Friday and another 3.9 per cent on
Saturday after the government ban on trading under false or borrowed names,
recovered 25 points, or 3.7 per cent, to 691.67.
Turnover expanded to Won399m from the Won271.3m seen in Saturday's half-day
session. There were rumours that the government would announce measures to
revive the market. But a Finance Ministry official said later that a meeting
of economic ministers to discuss a bail-out would make no announcement
yesterday.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index rose 97.24, or 1.3 per cent, to a new high of
7,489.49, aided by selective buying from overseas. Turnover was HKDollars
4.66bn, up from Friday's HKDollars 4.49bn.
There was more confidence about Chinese economic prospects, and buyers were
also encouraged by the strong performance of Stone Electronic, the Hong Kong
arm of a collectively owned Chinese company, which ended at HKDollars 2.625
in its trading debut, against its offer price of HKDollars 1.26.
SINGAPORE saw strong gains in selected blue chips as the Straits Times
Industrial index climbed 5.02 to a record 1,922.89. Singapore Press local
shares rose 50 cents to SDollars 12.60 in volume of 204,000 shares. Total
turnover was 115.4m shares, after Friday's 137.5m.
KUALA LUMPUR balanced profit-taking against impressive results from Malayan
Banking, up 20 cents at MDollars 14.70. The KLSE composite index closed just
0.85 higher at 772.76.
AUSTRALIA held up well in advance of today's budget, the All Ordinaries
index rising 14.8 to 1,870.7 in turnover of ADollars 293.1m on gains in some
blue chips and a slight recovery in golds.
News Corp forged ahead 23 cents to ADollars 9.13 and offset a heavy fall in
CSR, which lost 36 cents to ADollars 3.82 in early trade on adverse
newspaper reports about its US asbestos court case, but recovered slightly
to close at ADollars 3.96.
JAKARTA, closed today for Indonesia's Independence Day holiday, featured
strong gains by several banks in active trading, speculating on the prospect
of good half-year results as the JKSE index ended 2.07 firmer at 382.01.
BII advanced Rp400 to Rp5,000 and Bank Duta Rp325 to Rp3,250, while Bank
Danamon, Lippobank and Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia also strengthened.
BANGKOK saw a sheaf of weak second-quarter corporate earnings reports.
Investors sold near the end of the day and the SET index shed 10.33 to
954.29 in Bt6.27bn turnover.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Money Markets: DM call money down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN call money fell below the Bundesbank's official discount rate level
again yesterday, although there was little expectation that the German
central bank would announce a lower fixed rate repo this week, writes James
Blitz.
The fall in the cost of overnight lending in Germany, to 6.65-6.70 per cent
yesterday from 6.70-6.80 per cent on Friday, was the result of easier
conditions in the German money market.
Some dealers said that only a modest amount of August's tax payments had
come into the banks yesterday morning.
The last repo rate was set at 6.80 per cent for 14-day funds. But many
dealers expected the Bundesbank to set a similar price for funds today.
Euromark futures continued to reflect a pessimistic outlook for German rate
cuts, with the September contract losing 4 basis points to close at 93.49.
The French domestic interest rate market was shut yester-day because of the
mid-August holiday. But one dealer in London pointed out that there had been
a marked rise in Euro interest rates over the last three trading days,
putting them well above the level of France's domestic rates. These rates
reflect the cost of borrowing and depositing French francs offshore.
Three-month French Eurofrancs were quoted yesterday at 8.50 per cent, well
above their Thursday level of 7.87 per cent. By contrast, three-month
domestic French francs were quoted between 8.06 per cent and 8.31 per cent
on Friday.
The dealer wondered whether the rise in Euro rates had been the result of
concern that France might introduce some form of exchange control in the
wake of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism.
On Sunday, President Francois Mitterrand of France issued a particularly
strong attack on the way in which currency market speculation had foundered
the ERM.
However, others pointed out that the differential might have been the result
of distortions created by the holiday, and that the domestic market would
come into line today.
Sterling markets were comparatively quiet. The September short sterling
contract declined 4 basis points to finish at 94.25. Three-month sterling
cash was more or less unchanged at around 5 7/8 per cent. There was a daily
shortage of Pounds 1.7bn.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Fears of capital controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN exchange rate movements were comparatively calm yesterday because
of the mid-August holiday in some centres, but several currency analysts
spoke of concern about the prospect of capital controls being introduced on
the Continent, writes James Blitz.
The French franc weakened by about a centime at the start of yesterday's
trading, piercing the FFr3.54 level to the D-Mark. It closed at FFr3.544.
The Danish krone was relatively calm, ending at DKr4.1311 per D-Mark, having
been at DKr4.1566 earlier in the day.
In spite of the thin trading in European currencies, some analysts said they
had been deluged with calls from US and Asian customers who were concerned
about the prospect of capital controls being reintroduced in France.
They said alarm had been raised by President Mitterrand's comments at the
weekend, talking about the need to fight 'plots of money'. This followed
remarks last week from the French and Belgian governments about the need to
control capital flows.
One analyst said yesterday: 'I can never remember a time when I have
received so many calls in one day on a single issue.' Mr Steve Hannah, chief
economist at IBJ International in London, said the reimposition of capital
controls was extremely unlikely. But the move, he said, would bring such a
strong downturn in European asset markets that investors might hedge their
positions in any case.
Sterling performed quite strongly against the D-Mark, gaining  1/2 pfennig
at DM2.5025.
The pound has lost about 2 percentage points on its trade weighted index in
the last week amid speculation that the UK would cut interest rates. But,
according to an analyst, a 1 percentage point cut in UK interest rates has
now been fully priced into the market.
The dollar weakened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon in
Europe, dropping at one stage to a low of DM1.6845. It closed in London at
DM1.6865, nearly 2 1/2 pfennigs down on the day. In New York it ended at
DM1.6869.
Some dealers were mystified by the move, coming after July's industrial
output figures which showed an expected monthly rise of 0.4 per cent.
Others said it was a delayed reaction to the dollar's weakness against the
yen, which continued yesterday.
In spite of heavy intervention by the Bank of Japan, the yen climbed to a
new post-war high of Y100.80 against the dollar at the start of European
trading. It slipped back to close at Y101.05, but there was little doubt
that the Japanese currency would reach the Y100 level before too long. In
New York it finished at Y101.57.
Some analysts expressed surprise that the yen was climbing so far in spite
of talk of a cut in the Japanese discount rate and lethargic economic
activity. In the past week, Japanese call money has fallen to 3 1/16 per
cent from 3 1/4 per cent.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Britain's
dairy marketers prepare for a shake-up - Battle lines are being drawn ahead
of deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PONDEROUS and still incomplete reform of the UK system of milk marketing
has had rather less appeal than watching a vat of cheese curdle. Progress
over a period of three years has been painfully slow and it has often seemed
that after every step forward the industry negotiators have slipped two
back.
Some tardiness was inevitable, as deregulation of the milk market was forced
on the UK by the European Community because of the monopoly powers of the
marketing boards. Most dairy farmers, together with the elected
milk-producing members of the boards, resent the loss of an organisation
that has served them and their fathers well since the 1930s.
But some momentum is beginning to build, albeit at a stately pace. Late last
month, the Agriculture Bill permitting the winding-up of agricultural
marketing boards received the royal assent. Sometime next month the Milk
Marketing Board of England and Wales will publish its proposals for
reorganising itself into a co-operative called Milk Marque. By November, it
is hoped, Milk Marque will have issued contracts to farmers to supply it
with milk; and sometime between April and October 1994 the new organisation
will begin trading.
The latest delay is caused, apparently, by the need for Brussels bureaucrats
to agree the terms under which Milk Marque can keep some of its
subsidiaries.
These include the one that runs the present board's cattle breeding
services; National Milk Records, which is exactly what its name implies and
provides management advice based on herd yields recorded by board staff; and
Quality Testing, a laboratory service that assesses milk purity and freedom
from bacteria. It has already been agreed that the board's main subsidiary,
the milk processor Dairy Crest, will be floated on the stock exchange with
dairy farmers being issued with most of the shares.
Meanwhile, although Milk Marque has said it hopes to purchase 80 per cent of
the milk produced in England and Wales, other would-be players in the game
after deregulation are beginning to jockey for position.
One of the first to express interest in buying milk direct from farmers was
the Co-operative Wholesale Society. It has been holding meetings with dairy
farmers for the past two years to tell them what a good buyer it would be,
but has not come up with a positive proposal so far.
Last January, Northern Foods launched the Northern Milk Partnership together
with disillusioned ex-milk board vice-chairman Mr Richard Smith.
The partnership, it is explained, would act as the procurement agency for
the milk required by Northern Foods. The declared target was for 18 per cent
of present production, or 2bn litres of milk a year. Last week, Northern
Foods said that it had commitments for 75 per cent of the total.
Nestle was the next to go public with a proposed contract, released last
spring, although the company made it clear that it was only interested in
producers close to its processing factories, implying a limited demand.
Danish-based MD Foods also entered the ring this summer, indicating that it
wanted to buy milk direct from UK farmers and the company sent a caravan
round some agricultural shows to try to drum up interest.
Irish dairy company Avonmore has declared that it expects to be another
buyer of British milk from British farmers. In addition Unigate, CPC
Ambrosia and the newly-independent Dairy Crest are expected to want to
purchase direct from farms.
Whether all will eventually secure the contracts they seek is open to
conjecture. But as they battle for their share of the new free milk market,
it is reasonable to assume that they will be prepared to pay keen prices for
supplies and that this may continue for a year or two, until the shape of
the market becomes established.
Moreover, the managing director designate of Milk Marque, Mr Andrew Dare,
has already said that he expects his new company's price for milk to be
among the three highest in Europe.
This was clearly a shot across the bows of his likely competitors and they
will equally clearly be forced to match such prices if they want to stay in
the game. So milk producers can probably look forward to a short-term boom.
But the background to all this anticipated activity in a sector that
accounts for 20 per cent of UK farm production is that it has been losing
its share of the home market, mainly to European competition. According to
Mr Bud Wendover, head of strategic development for Food from Britain, the UK
farming industry's promotional agency, the country's total dairy trade
deficit increased last year by 35 per cent to a record Pounds 609m, with the
balance of trade with other EC members worsening by 38 per cent.
The root of the problem, he said, was that 'much of our home-based
production is still focused on products of low value in declining markets,
while we import higher value products. This cannot be in the interests of
either producers or processors'.
For while UK sales of liquid milk continue to decline, sales of cream,
yoghurt and some cheeses are steadily increasing - and many of those
added-value milk products are being imported.
The main reason for Britain's failure to respond adequately to changes in
the market mix is historical. Prior to the introduction of milk quotas in
1984, UK dairy farmers were being encouraged by the government to produce as
much milk as they could, irrespective of demand. It was denied at the time,
as was the possibility of the introduction of quotas, but it was clearly an
attempt to enable Britain to qualify for as big a production entitlement as
possible.
But that milk had to be disposed of and the only markets guaranteed by the
EC at the time were for butter and skimmed milk powder, which were sold as
surpluses to EC intervention stores. Plants to process those low-value
products were established and most continue to operate.
The present growth area, however, is the market for fresh chilled dairy
products such as prepared desserts, yoghurts and soft cheeses. European
dairy companies have been quick to recognise this fact and are cashing in.
For the good of UK Ltd as well as a dairy farmers, therefore, it is
important that whoever eventually purchases milk from British farmers should
position themselves to exploit growth opportunities on our doorstep, rather
than leaving them to be filled from abroad.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee rises as Africans agree
on retention scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES built on strong gains in late trading in London yesterday
after African producers agreed to join Latin American exporters in keeping
up to 20 per cent of their output off the world market.
The plan, designed to shore up coffee prices following the collapse of talks
on a new international price pact in March, won the backing of the African
robusta producers at a meeting with the Latin American arabica producers in
Kampala.
The price of the November robusta futures contract rose to a high of Dollars
1,171 after the news came out in the late afternoon, before easing to close
at Dollars 1,161, up Dollars 39. 'It was already on the move and that just
boosted it,' said one trader. 'It dispelled any doubts about the weakness of
the market that had arisen after New York fell out of bed last week.'
The New York December arabica contract was up 2.15 at 74.15 cents a lb in
late trading.
The decision by the African producers, which means some 80 per cent of world
coffee output will be covered by the retention scheme, was generally
expected. The November contract price has risen nearly 19 per cent in the
past month, as the Latin American plan gained credibility.
But analysts said last week's sell-off in the New York market, following the
evaporation of the latest Brazilian frost scare, might have hastened
yesterday's announcement by demonstrating to producers that the recovery in
prices was not entirely self-supporting.
The London robusta market held up reasonably well last week as traders
anticipated good news from the Kampala meeting. The rise yesterday was
helped by trade buying and a shortage of immediate physical supplies, as
well as technical moves in the run-up to the expiry of options this week.
'Everything seems set fair,' said one trader. 'The more the market becomes
convinced the retention scheme is going to become a reality, there's no
reason why it shouldn't go on up.'
The 25-nation Inter-African Coffee Organisation had originally proposed to
retain 15 per cent of exportable production, but agreed to the 20 per cent
figure under pressure from the Latin and Central American producers.
'We believe that a 20 per cent retention is the shock treatment required to
deal with a sick market,' said Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, the Ivory Coast coffee
minister and IACO chairman.
Some coffee producers appear anxious to avoid antagonising consuming
countries by pushing up prices too far. Mr Gauze said: 'I do not think that
this policy of retention favours an excessive price explosion'.
The Kampala meeting is also due to set up an association of coffee-producing
nations to supervise retention.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK facing free trade 'quagmire'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN FOODS, the UK food manufacturer, says 'a quagmire' will result from
the replacement of the Milk Marketing Board by a 'monopoly broker', when the
milk industry in England and Wales is opened to competition next year.
In a paper on the new milk market, Northern Foods points out that Milk
Marque, the MMB's successor, will have a dominant position but no processing
facilities, given the planned flotation of Dairy Crest, the MMB's trading
arm.
Therefore the imbalance between supply and demand during the year might
tempt Milk Marque to do special deals with milk processors, says the food
group, whose Northern Milk Partnership, run jointly with dairy farmers, is
the leading rival to Milk Marque.
Mr Neil Davidson, group executive in charge of milk policy at Northern
Foods, points out that for 10 months of the year there is not enough milk
left over, once fresh market demand is satisfied, to make use of all the
processing capacity available to convert it into cheese, butter or skimmed
milk. But the opposite is true twice a year - in the spring and over
Christmas and New Year - when excess milk supplies are large.
If these processors insist on fixed quantities of milk at special prices in
return for accommodating Milk Marque at its most vulnerable time, this would
run counter to the need for Milk Marque to be open and fair with all buyers
of milk under competition law, says Mr Davidson.
The same would be true, he argues, if Milk Marque offered processors of
fresh milk products special deals in order to overcome potential
dissatisfaction over the premiums they will have to pay to be sure of
obtaining the supplies they need.
'All of this amounts to a quagmire which would not exist but for the
presence of a monopoly broker,' he says.
Mr Davidson also questions the justification for the MMB's claim that Milk
Marque will pay UK producers among the highest prices in Europe. Some
northern European milk farmers are paid more than UK producers because their
input costs are higher and because they tend to sell their milk directly to
the consumer through co-operatives, he says.
If Milk Marque did achieve such prices, he suggests, it would be 'by trying
to use its monopoly muscle' and the consumer would have to pay.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minero plans to sell Ilo copper
refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE state-owned mining firm Minero Peru has given notice that it intends to
sell off its copper refinery in the southern port of Ilo, where Southern
Peru Copper Corporation refines its mineral into copper blister, Reuter
reports from Lima.
The refinery is to be sold through an international tender in late November,
and Minero Peru will require interested parties to assume certain minimum
commitments in developing the refinery, an advertisement by the Minero Peru
privatisation committee said.
The refinery, located some 1,100km (660 miles) south of Lima, has capacity
to process 190,000 tonnes of blister a year. The advertisement said the sale
would be open to national and international investors through a
pre-qualification process.
Radio Programas del Peru, in a report from its correspondent in Ilo, quoted
Mr Rafael Toledo, the head of the Minero Peru privatisation committee, as
saying that Southern Peru was interested in buying the refinery.
Neither Southern Peru nor Minero Peru officials were available for comment.
Southern, with two mines in nearby Cuajone and Toquepala, produces
two-thirds of Peru's copper.
Toledo was also quoted as saying there would be a 10 per cent reduction in
personnel at the refinery prior to the privatisation.
Minero Peru plans to sell the Cerro Verde copper mine on October 13 and has
announced the sale of two copper deposits for the end of the year. Later, it
will auction off a gold deposit at San Antonio de Poto and a zinc refinery
at Cajamarquilla.

THE GOLD price looked set to mount a test of the upper in of its recent
price range as it moved ahead yesterday to close in London at Dollars 373.75
a troy ounce, up Dollars 5 from Friday. Dealers said the rise was caused by
heavy US investment fund buying. SILVER joined in the uptrend, gaining 15.50
to 477.50 cents an ounce, but the PLATINUM market was relatively muted,
rising only Dollars 2.75 to Dollars 387.75 an ounce. At the London Metal
Exchange the COPPER market appeared to be finding support around the Dollars
1,900 level for three months metal and despite a dip to Dollars 1,898,
coinciding with a slight narrowing in cash-to-three-months premium, the
price recovered in the afternoon aided by the steady performance of copper
futures at the New York Commodity Exchange dollar weakness. The ZINC market
was again supported on dips toward Dollars 880 a tonne for the three months
position but rallies failed to attract follow-through interest, dealers
said. Manufacturer Buying interest boosted London COCOA futures, with the
December position closing Pounds 25 up at Pounds 786 a tonne.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru aims to attract investment
to its oil industry with new laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE laws governing development of Peru's oil resources were passed in
congress last Friday by a substantial majority. According to Mr Demetrio
Patsias, former vice-minister of mines and energy, and now a congressman for
the ruling alliance, the laws will give the Peruvian oil industry the boost
it badly needs.
The legislation is aimed at making Peru as attractive to investors as
Colombia or Argentina. Mr Patsias said that in the past two years only eight
wells had been drilled in Peru, compared with 100 in Argentina and 50 in
Colombia. The recovery of oil reserves was a top priority, he said - levels
have more than halved from about 835m barrels in 1981.
Some earlier legal limitations will be now lifted, investors will be free to
dispose of the oil they extract in any way they wish, and exports will be
free of tax. In addition, longstanding restrictions that prevented foreign
oil companies from exploring within 30 miles of Peru's frontiers have also
been eliminated.
A new state organ, Perupetro, is also created. It is charged with the
promotion of investment in oil exploration and development, and will replace
state-owned Petroperu in the negotiation of contracts with investors. It
will also take over administration of taxes and royalties.
It is assumed the new legislation will also clear the way for Petroperu's
privatisation. A technical evaluation of the state-owned oil giant has
already been carried out by Booz-Allen and Hamilton of New York, but the
controversial recommendations - which include splitting the company into up
to 40 operating units - have not yet been officially accepted.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium group to cut
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REYNOLDS METALS, the second-largest US aluminium group, said yesterday it
would temporarily close another 88,000 tonnes of capacity because of the
worldwide supply/demand imbalance.
It was also reported that a pay strike by Romanian train drivers might force
that country's Alro aluminium smelter to shut down because of a lack of raw
materials.
But this news produced only a slight rally in London Metal Exchange
aluminium prices. Metal for delivery in three months had fallen to Dollars
1,200 a tonne, but recovered to close at Dollars 1.204.50, down Dollars 2.75
from Friday's close.
Rumours of Reynolds' cut had been in the market for two weeks and was
'factored into the price already,' suggested Mr Angus MacMillan, research
manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Also the cut was not as big as had been hoped. Nevertheless, in the longer
term this was good news for the market. 'The less capacity there is, the
quicker the price will recover. The important thing is for the producers to
continue to exercise restraint when prices start to rise next year and not
bring back all this shut capacity.'
Reynolds pointed out that, once the latest cut became effective in late
October, 209,000 tonnes, or 21 per cent, of its total capacity of 991,000
tonnes will have been shut. The 121,000 Troutdale smelter in Oregon has been
idle for nearly two years. In October a 41,000 tonne line at the Massena,
New York, smelter will be closed down and two totalling 47,000 tonnes at
Longview, Washington.
The group is taking a third-quarter, after-tax charge of Dollars 8m, or 13
cents a share, to cover the costs which involve laying off 350 employees.
Nickel production fell 12 per cent to 394,300 tonnes in the first half of
1993, according to the International Nickel Study Group. Nickel consumption
rose from 414,200 tonnes to 419,000 tonnes.
The International Lead and Zinc Study Group reports that lead mine output in
the first half was down 7.5 per cent to 1,059,000 tonnes. However, refined
lead output was up 1.3 per cent to 2,258,000 tonnes. Lead consumption fell
by 1 per cent to 2,210,000 tonnes. Zinc mine output fell by 7.2 per cent to
2,633,000 tonnes and refined output was 0.4 per cent down at 2,722,000
tonnes. Consumption of refined zinc was down 1 per cent at 2,683,000 tonnes.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: US sentiment positive in wake of bullish
data

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-DATED US Treasury securities continued to post solid gains yesterday
as sentiment in the bond market remained positive in the wake of recent
bullish data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  19/32 at 99
1/4 , yielding 6.304 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 1/2 , to yield 3.964 per cent.
Bonds firmed from the opening, although traders said the gains were more a
reflection of the lack of selling rather than the presence of heavy buying.
The morning's economic news had little impact upon prices. The 0.4 per cent
increase in July industrial production was in line with forecasts, although
the rise in capacity utilisation to 81.5 per cent was smaller than expected.
Analysts said the data confirmed that the manufacturing economy remains
subdued, and that overall growth this year would struggle to break 2 per
cent.
Otherwise, the main feature of the day was some technical yield
curve-flattening trades, which involved buying longer-dated Treasuries to
shrink the gap between yields at the long and short ends of the market.
The long bond was also helped by the fact that last week's auction of
Dollars 11bn 30-year bonds will be the last such auction until next
February.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds, which ended last week on an enthusiastic note, came
down to earth yesterday, with longer-dated issues closing nearly 1/4 point
lower.
Friday afternoon saw a sudden rally in gilt prices following an announcement
by the Bank of England that it would not be holding a gilt auction this
month.
There had been plenty of speculation last week that the Bank might still
hold an auction in August, even though it is well ahead with the
government's borrowing programme: the announcement that this month's auction
would not take place helped to boost the market and the Liffe gilt futures
contract closed at 113.09 on Friday.
However, the euphoria did not last in yesterday's trading as the market
appeared to be overbought, and the futures contract touched a low of 112.29
before trading at around 113.00 by late afternoon.
One economist pointed out that, even though the Bank is not holding an
auction this month, the market could still see further new supply, albeit in
tap form.
The market's main focus of attention this week is likely to be the Retail
Price Index figure, which is expected to show a rise to about 1.4 per cent
in July, compared with 1.2 per cent in June. The RPI will be announced
tomorrow.
GERMAN government bonds fell sharply in afternoon trading, partly due to
heavy selling by US investors.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 97.56, quickly rose to its
high of 97.63 yesterday morning and then drifted for much of the day. But
heavy selling in the afternoon took the futures contract down to a low of
97.15 where it ended the day.
Bund market participants expect the Bundesbank to announce its M3 money
supply figures for July sometime this week.
However, dealers warn that the figures are likely to be distorted because of
heavy intervention by the central bank during the recent bout of currency
turmoil.
JAPANESE government bonds ended lower on the day, despite the combination of
a strong yen and a fall in money market rates.
The bond market started off on a relatively firm note as some market
participants believed that the sharp fall in prices on Friday had been
overdone.
The yen reached a new post-war high against the US dollar of 101.10 in Tokyo
trading and strengthened still further to 100.80 in the London trading
session. But dealers said the yen's strength did little to boost the bond
market.
In the money market, the rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell to
a record low of 2.96 per cent, from 3.0 per cent on Friday. The Bank of
Japan did little to mop up excess liquidity, dealers said, raising
expectations that the central bank may cut its Official Discount Rate fairly
soon.
The December futures contract, which opened at 111.31, rose to a high of
111.43 and closed at 110.90, only slightly down from Friday's close of
110.95.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for CDollars 1bn global
offering from Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market had a fairly active start to the week as the
Province of Quebec launched its previously-announced CDollars 1bn global
offering to good demand. Syndicate managers expect new bond issuance to
remain buoyant in the coming days.
A spokesman at the joint lead manager, Merrill Lynch, said that strong
investor interest, especially from North America and Europe, enabled
Quebec's 10-year bonds to be priced to yield 68 basis points above the yield
on the Canadian 7 1/2 per cent Treasury due 2003.
The pricing of the offering came at the lower end of the yield spread target
of 68 to 70 basis points. The bonds were freed to trade yesterday afternoon
and were bid at their re-offer price of 98.813.
In addition to Luxembourg, Quebec's global offering has listings in Hong
Kong and Singapore for the first time, to recognise the growing interest
among Pacific/Asia investors for bonds which are traded internationally.
The World Bank also included Hong Kong in the listing of its Dollars 100m
three-year deal, for the same reason as Quebec.
Yesterday's offering from the World Bank gives investors an opportunity to
increase their return if Italian interest rates fall during the life of the
bonds.
The initial, semi-annual coupon on the bonds will be 2 per cent. Thereafter,
the coupon, which is paid in dollars, will pay 11.5 per cent minus six-month
lire Libor, which stood just below 9 per cent yesterday.
'We believe that Italian interest rates will go a lot lower,' said a
spokesman at the lead manager, Morgan Stanley, which has arranged similar
deals in various currences for private placement in the past. He added that
the borrower had hedged itself against this eventuality.
Investors in Pacific/Asia had shown a particular interest in the offering
and around half of the bonds already sold had been placed in that region,
the spokesman said. The bonds were re-offered at their issue price of par
and were not freed to trade by yesterday afternoon.
In the same sector, Cemex, the Mexican cement company, launched a Dollars
120m seven-year offering which completes its Dollars 650m Euro medium-term
note programme. A spokesman at the lead manager, Citibank, said that most of
the bonds were placed with US investors but that there had been interest
from Europe and Japan. US investors are keen to buy Latin American bonds
because their higher yield.
Cemex's bonds were priced to yield 311 basis points above the yield on the
8.75 per cent US Treasury of August 2000. The pricing reflects the steady
tightening of yield spreads for Latin American issuers over the last year.
The bonds were freed to trade yesterday and were quoted at par bid, up from
a re-offer price of 99.74.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has set up an
Ecu1bn global commercial paper programme under which it may issue commercial
paper in the US and in the international bond market.
The EBRD plans to draw on the multi-currency facility at the start of
September, Ms Veronique Pellan, part of the bank's funding team, said.
She added that proceeds from the programme will be used to replace existing
bank loans and for cash management and short-term hedging purposes.
With regard to the EBRD's longer-term borrowing programme, Ms Pellan said
that the bank has almost completed its 1993 funding target of Ecu900m.

market future

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST money market future to be launched on the Copenhagen stock
exchange will be introduced on September 22, the fifth anniversary of the
start of the futures and options market there.
The Guarantee Fund for Futures and Options announced that the new future
will be based on the three-month Cibor (Copenhagen interbank offer rate),
the interest rate at which banks and savings banks are able to deposit
kroner uncollateralised for three months with a prime bank.
The introduction of a money market future will mean that Copenhagen can
offer investors, including foreign investors, a full range of futures and
options, which already exist for government bonds, long-term mortgage bonds
and the KFX index of most-traded shares.
The contract size for the Cibor futures will be DKr5m, with maturities of
three and six months.
Settlement dates will be two business days before the third Wednesday in
March, June, September and December, which are also known as the
international money market days.
'When the Cibor futures are successfully launched, we will consider
launching options on Cibor futures and maybe also other money market
instruments,' said Mr Tyge Vorstrup Rasmussen, chief executive officer of
the Guaranteee Fund.

treasury issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SHANGHAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BEIJING plans to issue a record amount of treasury bonds next year, Reuter
reports from Shanghai.
The planned value of 1994 bond issues is Yn60bnto Yn70bn (Dollars 10.4bn to
Dollars 12.2bn), more than double this year's total of Yn30bn, the Jiefang
Daily quoted a senior finance ministry official as saying.
In all, Yn30bn of 1994 bonds will be sold through provinces and localities.
These bonds may be traded on the secondary market, the paper said.
Another Yn30bn would be bought by state-owned 'specialist' banks and would
not be traded, while Yn10bn would be paperless scrip for issue on the
primary market.
At present, state banks hold virtually no bonds, depriving the Beijing of a
powerful tool to regulate the economy.
However, the official made it clear that state-owned banks are being asked
to buy bonds not for the state to use as an instrument of economic control
but to utilise the banks' huge deposits to bail the government out of its
immediate financial crisis.
The newspaper gave no details of the coupon rates for next year's bonds.
Three-year bonds issued this year carry a coupon of 13.96 per cent and
five-year bonds 15.86 per cent.
The 1993 bond issues flopped because coupon were set unrealistically low and
were swamped by inflation. In addition, many individual investors chased
opportunities in the booming stock and property markets and were lured by
spectacular returns from unauthorised enterprise bonds.
Beijing was twice forced to raise 1993 coupons. In the end, the issues were
forced on local governments with a threat to stop provinces from listing
shares on China's stock markets until the bonds were sold.
After extending the deadline for selling the bonds, Beijing said last month
that they had been sold. The authorities are increasingly relying on bonds
to balance the budget.

TELEVISION Broadcasts, Hong Kong's leading television company, announced a
27 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 163.5m (USDollars 21.08m)
for the six months to June 1993, up from HKDollars 128.3m in 1992.
Turnover was up 8.5 per cent to HKDollars 871.5m. The company said earnings
growth came from more efficient allocation of resources and aggressive
marketing. However, international programme licensing revenues continued to
be hampered by piracy from illegal Taiwanese cable TV operators.
TVB is controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw and Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok,
who tried to sell a 22 per cent stake to Mr Rupert Murdoch in July, only to
be thwarted by Hong Kong's television ownership restrictions.
TVB faces competition with the launch of cable television in Hong Kong on
October 31, and from Mr Murdoch, who recently bought 64 per cent of Star,
the satellite broadcaster.
The interim dividend is 15 cents a share.

Ralston Purina, the St Louis-based manufacturer of pet food, batteries and a
variety of food products, announced late yesterday that it was considering
spining off its cereal, baby foods and other smaller 'grocery human foods'
businesses as a separately-quoted company, writes Nikki Tait.
Ralston said that the potential demerger would be reviewed by directors at a
board meeting to be held on September 23.
Ralston is a sizeable force in the cereal market, where it is best-known for
the 'Chex' brands, although it ranks behind industry heavyweights, such as
Kellogg and General Mills.
The St Louis group has also been heavily involved in the private label
cereal business, a growing segment of the overall market, and is reckoned to
be the dominant producer.
Its baby-food products are marketed under the 'Beech-Nut' brand name. This
industry has been highly competitive recently, and subject to a price war
between rival manufacturers.

AN investor group led by Texas billionaire Mr Robert Bass yesterday said it
had completed the acquisition of eight food companies from Beledia NV of the
Netherlands for about Dollars 1.1bn, in the first big leveraged buy-out
since 1992.
The acquisition partners include Keystone Inc (formerly the Robert M. Bass
Group), Keystone's affiliate Acadia Partners, UBS Capital, Haas Wheat &amp;
Partners, Acadia Partner, and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
They have formed a corporation, called Specialty Foods, which plans to build
the businesses into an even bigger food company.
Senior financing for the deal was provided by a group of banks led by
Chemical Bank.
Specialty Foods said further growth would come from extending product lines,
improving market penetration and making other strategic acquisitions.
Artal Belgium, an affiliate of the seller, will be a substantial equity
investor in Specialty Foods.
The investor group said it was attracted by the market positions of the food
companies and their products.
The eight companies, with annual revenues of Dollars 2.1bn, are Stella Foods
of Green Bay, Wisconsin; Metz Baking Company of Sioux City, Iowa; Pacific
Coast Baking Company and Mother's Cake &amp; Cookie Company of Oakland,
California; Burns &amp; Ricker of Paterson, New Jersey; B&amp;G/DSD of Roseland, New
Jersey; H&amp;M Food Systems Company of Forth Worth, Texas; and Gordon's
Wholesale of Des Moines, Iowa.

TEXTRON, the US aerospace group that diversified into financial services
during the 1980s, said yesterday that it planned to sell a minority stake in
its Paul Revere insurance subsidiary, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The intended sale of 17 per cent of the disability insurer signals a plan to
reduce the group's involvement in the financial services business and focus
instead on its manufacturing operations, Textron said. However, it added
that it had 'no present plans' to sell further shares in Paul Revere or any
other financial services business.
Paul Revere, a leading name in the North American individual disability
insurance market, generated insurance premiums last year of just over
Dollars 1bn. Its profits are not broken down separately, but Textron said it
made a 'substantial contribution' to earnings in 1992.
Textron said it would offer 7.5m shares in the insurer for sale, and that an
over-allotment provision in the sale could take its holding down to 81 per
cent. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt, the company said.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Standard Chartered to appeal on
US ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, is to pursue
its legal case against accountants Price Waterhouse in connection with the
firm's audit of United Bank of Arizona.
In a statement issued yesterday, Standard Chartered said it had filed a
notice of appeal in Maricopa County, Arizona, against the decision by a
state superior court judge to overthrow a Dollars 338m jury verdict against
Price Waterhouse.
Judge John Sticht had last December granted Price Waterhouse's motion for a
new trial in July 1992 after ruling that the verdicts were inconsistent.
His judgment overturned a verdict in May last year after an 11-month trial
which found against the firm on seven out of eight charges.
That left Standard Chartered with the options of appealing against the
decision, pursuing a new trial or entering discussions for an out-of-court
settlement.
The bank brought a lawsuit against the firm in 1988 alleging that Price
Waterhouse failed to identify and report 'material deficiencies' in the loan
portfolio and internal control systems of United Bank of Arizona, and that
its audits for 1985 and 1986 were negligent.
Standard Chartered bought United Bank in 1987 for Dollars 335m. It made
heavy losses and was sold 18 months later to Citicorp for Dollars 207m.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: HK TV broadcaster posts profits
up 27%

TELEVISION Broadcasts, Hong Kong's leading television company, announced a
27 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 163.5m (USDollars 21.08m)
for the six months to June 1993, up from HKDollars 128.3m in 1992.
Turnover was up only 8.5 per cent to HKDollars 871.5m, and the company said
the earnings growth came from more efficient allocation of production
resources and more aggressive marketing. However, international programme
licensing revenues continued to be hampered by piracy from illegal Taiwanese
cable TV operators.
TVB is controlled by Sir Run Run Shaw and Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok,
who attempted to sell a 22 per cent stake to Mr Rupert Murdoch in July, only
to be thwarted by Hong Kong's television ownership restrictions. Mr Murdoch
was interested in accessing TVB's library of Chinese language programmes.
TVB faces competition with the launch of cable television in Hong Kong on
October 31, and from Mr Murdoch, who recently bought 64 per cent of Star,
the satellite broadcaster.
The company plans to reap greater yields from its film library by launching
its own satellite TV service next year.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 15 cents a share, compared
with 12.5 cents in 1992.
The directors of Hong Kong department store operator Sincere Company, who
awarded themselves HKDollars 115m (USDollars 14.9m) in remuneration, against
net profit before extraordinary items of HKDollars 47m, yesterday agreed to
repay a HKDollars 67m bonus fee. The payment had been approved by
shareholders at the annual meeting, but was criticised by the financial
community.
Mr Walter Ma, chairman, believes the fees were fair and reasonable. However,
he said that 'with a view to maintaining the good name of the company', the
directors had volunteered to repay the fees.
During the year the group sold its headquarters building, reaping a
HKDollars 1.08bn extraordinary profit.

PEERLESS, one of North America's biggest carpet groups, will probably
manufacture in Mexico if the North American Free Trade Agreement is
approved, and shift its US and Canadian mills to more specialised products,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Industry over-capacity would mean that an upsurge in Mexican production
would take some years to materialise, but 'there is no mistake about the
implications of Nafta,' Mr Bram Garber, chairman, said after the annual
meeting.
In the US, Peerless was gaining market share and conditions were improving
slightly, he said. But in Canada, the market continues to be soft and
Peerless is rationalising its distribution system.
Peerless will reduce losses in the current quarter ending August 31, and
return to profitability in the third quarter, Mr Garber added.
In fiscal 1993, it lost CDollars 5.2m (USDollars 4m) on sales of CDollars
480m.

Under the new arrangement, Pacific Dunlop will hold a 51 per cent interest

Mr Philip Bass, Pacific Dunlop managing director, said yesterday the new

'The joint venture will allow the Australian business to source

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Impala cuts payout as metal
prices weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S Impala Platinum, the world's second-largest producer, is
cutting its dividend by 18 per cent to 140 cents per share in the year to
June as weak metal prices caused attributable income to fall by 22 per cent
to R200.7m (Dollars 59.70m).
The weak financial results disguised a considerable improvement in group
operating performance. Mr Michael McMahon, chairman, said the group had left
behind the technical and industrial relations problems of 18 months ago.
'The on-going process of technical advance and improving operational
efficiencies have put the group in a position to survive and compete in the
current market and to face the future from a more robust base,' he said.
Although the group achieved record production levels, a 17 per cent
reduction in the total sales revenue per ounce of platinum to R2,010, caused
turnover to fall by 2 per cent to R2.21bn from R2.26bn. Mining income
dropped by 38 per cent to R294.1m from R476.1m.
Increased production and tight cost control saw unit costs fall by 9 per
cent. This followed retrenchment measures which saw the labour force decline
by 18 per cent - 8,000 people - between December 1991 and June this year.
Capital expenditure was curtailed drastically to R157m from R411m in 1992.
Impala is now planning only a modest production increase, to 1.2m ounces a
year by 1998 from 1.1m ounces currently. There is no immediate prospect of
the Barplats or Messina operations being reopened.
Mr McMahon said future performance would depend largely on movements in the
rhodium price. He said 'it would be realistic to expect next year to be
similar to or only slightly better than the year under review'.

Daiwa - Emiko Terazono examines the Japanese bank's purchase of Cosmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DAIWA Bank sees its rescue of Cosmo Securities
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the schedule for which is due to be announced today - as a wholly natural
move.
The two institutions are former operations of Nomura Shoten, a money
exchanger set up by Tokushichi Nomura in the late 19th century. 'They are
like brother companies,' says an official at Japan's ministry of finance.
Mr Hiroshi Nakano, president of Cosmo, said the company had posted
extraordinary losses of Y69.8bn (Dollars 682m) due to its tobashi deals, or
shuffling of one client's account to another to avoid realisation of
investment losses. 'The only way for Cosmo to survive is to become a
subsidiary of Daiwa.'
Cosmo has a negative net worth of Y7.1bn, and its capital adequacy ratio had
plunged to a negative 280 per cent. Daiwa will inject Y70bn to Y80bn through
share purchases.
The situation is a clear embarrassment to the ministry of finance and the
Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities watchdog
set up last year. Cosmo said it had found out about the tobashi deals early
last year, but had not informed the authorities.
The ministry took action against Cosmo over a number of separate tobashi
cases late last year. The SESC, which had investigated the broker, had
failed to uncover the crippling losses.
Although Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, last week claimed Cosmo's
operations were unrepresentative of other small brokerages, many analysts
suggest that Cosmo could be the tip of the iceberg. The ministry has started
an investigation of 48 brokerages to look for irregular sheet trading.
The rescue will leave Daiwa with more than 50 per cent of Cosmo, making it
the first bank to own a stock brokerage affiliate. The anti-monopoly law
prohibits banks from holding more than 5 per cent of a company, but in
Cosmo's case this ruling has been waived. From April, Japanese banks have
been allowed partial entrance into the securities industry.
Ministry of finance officials say that the exception was made because the
stock market is still fragile and the economy has yet to recover. 'This does
not mean we will not let a single broker fail,' said Mr Sohei Hidaka,
director-general of the ministry of finance. But some analysts assess that
Daiwa's acquisition of Cosmos may accelerate the pace of deregulation of the
barrier between the country's banking and securities industries.
The government drew up plans in the late 1980s to allow banks into the
securities industry. The move met with fierce opposition from Japan's
stockbrokers: and the recent weakness of the stock market has tended to slow
the banks' entrance into the business.
However, the government's decision to allow Daiwa to rescue Cosmo through
acquisition comes as brokerages, especially the smaller houses which depend
on commissions from retail operations for revenue, are in dire need of
financial help as trading volume on the stock market has plunged. Cosmo
itself posted a pre-tax loss of Y150m for the first four months to July.
In the near-term, the Cosmo bail-out is likely to place a heavy financial
burden on Daiwa, which will need to pump in additional funds for the
broker's restructuring. Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings
agency, yesterday said it was placing Daiwa Bank under review for a possible
downgrade.
Longer term, however, all that could change. According to Mr David Marsh,
analyst at IBCA, the banking credit agency, Daiwa is in an exciting position
with trust banking, commercial banking and broking as its three main
operations.
Investors on the Tokyo stock market remained calm, with the leading Nikkei
average moving ahead yesterday. A Cosmo spokesman said while some individual
investors had cancelled their accounts, most corporate investors remained
undeterred.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Restructuring enables Saab Auto
to trim deficit
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB AUTOMOBILE, the Swedish car group jointly owned by General Motors of
the US and Saab-Scania, yesterday announced a second-quarter loss after
financial items of SKr423m (Dollars 51.8m). This is a 17 per cent
improvement on the SKr507m deficit for the same 1992 period.
The result helped the company maintain its first-quarter progress and took
its first-half loss after financial items to SKr561m, compared with SKr800m
last year.
However, there was an SKr123m extraordinary charge covering start-up costs
for the Saab 900 model which is to be introduced in the autumn. This left
the first-half deficit before appropriations and taxes at SKr684m, against
SKr782m last year.
Saab said the improvement reflected the benefits of its ongoing
restructuring programme, rather than any market upturn or benefit from the
depreciation of the Swedish krona.
First-half sales were down 4 per cent to SKr7.75bn from SKr8.06bn, although
the fall in the second quarter was 9 per cent.
A Saab official said market conditions remained very tough in the group's
key Nordic markets.
He added that although there had been some improvement in the UK, sales were
also falling in Germany and the US market was 'not that strong'.
First-half retail sales fell to 36,000 cars from 46,000. The company said
this was because it stopped making the old 900 series in March and took its
holiday period, when production is stopped, earlier than usual.
It is sticking by an earlier forecast of 80,000 sales for the whole of 1993,
pinning its hopes on strong demand for the new Saab 900 in the last few
months of the year.
The company expects a substantial improvement on the SKr2.69bn deficit it
sustained for the whole of 1992 but it says it will remain in the red.

SALES at Toys 'R' Us, the US toy retailer, grew by 5.4 per cent in the
second quarter to Dollars 1.3bn, despite a fall in sales inside the US due
to a lack of big-selling new products.
Net earnings rose by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 35.5m, or 12 cents a share,
from Dollars 32.7m, or 11 cents, a year earlier, reflecting a switch in
sales towards higher-margin products and better control of inventory, said
Mr Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive.
The improvement in margins should be sustained in the second half as sales
of computer game software pick up, said Ms Dorothy Lakner, an analyst at
Oppenheimer in New York.
First-half net earnings of Dollars 70.9m, or 24 cents a share, were up from
Dollars 61m, or 21 cents, in 1992. Sales rose by 7.5 per cent to Dollars
2.6bn.

KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, reported lower post-tax profits in
the quarter to July, with core discount stores still under pressure and
losses growing on its Pace membership warehouse operation.
But the company's shares edged up Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 23 1/8 in
New York after Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said
second-half earnings were expected to exceed last year's levels.
Renewed strength in consumer spending, good weather, and promotional
activities, had brought about an improvement, he said.
Net income for the second quarter of Dollars 102m, or 22 cents a share, was
down more than one-third from Dollars 168m, or 37 cents, a year ago.
The company, which is in the process of revamping many of its stores to
compete with the faster-growing Wal Mart, had warned at the end of June of a
likely fall in profits.
First-half net income fell to Dollars 152m, or 33 cents a share, before
special items, from Dollars 284m, or 62 cents, the year before. Sales grew
by 10 per cent, to Dollars 19.2bn.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: GE buys Wasa unit for SKr1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASA, the Swedish insurance group, is selling its consumer finance
operation, Finax, to GE Capital for more than SKr1bn (Dollars 122.4m).
The US company, which is part of the General Electric group, has also agreed
to refinance existing Finax borrowings totalling SKr3bn.
The deal will strengthen Wasa's balance sheet and increase its focus on its
core insurance activities. The company will make a capital gain of at least
SKr330m on the disposal, as Finax has a book value of SKr669m.
It represents GE Capital's first major acquisition in Sweden and is line
with the company's desire to expand its consumer financial services
operations in Europe.
The group already has a credit card operation, Storecard, in the UK and is
in the process of setting up a joint venture consumer lending business in
Spain.
Mr Raymond Nied, manager of GE Capital's International Business Development,
said: 'We think the timing of the purchase is right as we hope the worst of
the Swedish recession is now behind us.'
Finax services around 400, 000 personal customers in Sweden and Norway
through five companies offering consumer credit through unsecured loans and
credit cards. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of SKr190m on total
lending, net of provisions for credit losses, of SKr3.7bn. Profits this year
are expected to at least equal last year's level.
Proceeds from the sale will be fed back into the two mutual insurance groups
at the heart of the Wasa group, Wasa Life and Wasa Non-Life, though the
repayment of inter-company debt. The deal is expected to be completed on
August 31.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Share exchange offer for Massa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METRO, the Swiss-based retail giant, is giving shareholders in Massa the
chance to exchange their shares for shares in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus,
another quoted German retailer majority-owned by the privately-owned
Swiss-retailer.
Metro said this would give shareholders in the lossmaking Massa the
opportunity to participate directly in Asko, itself in the throes of
extensive rationalisation following Metro's purchase of a majority stake
last year.
At present, Massa is 65 per cent-owned by Metro and Asko via MHB Handel, a
holding company.
Analysts said the transaction was probably driven by tax considerations  -
the greater its stake in Massa the larger its potential write-off against
profits in other parts of a group which is estimated to have DM70bn (Dollars
40.6bn) turnover worldwide.
But Metro said yesterday that the move was appropriate in the light of
closer business co-operation between Asko and Massa.
Massa recently reported losses of DM51.5m for 1992 on turnover of DM5.24bn
after a net profit of DM17.5m in the previous year. The losses reflect
problems with aggressive expansion in credit-finance between 1985 and 1991.
This boosted sales of furniture and electronic equipment but led to heavy
losses. Mr Dietmar Mooslechner, chief executive, has said Massa would only
be fit to pay a dividend in 1994-1995.
Shares in Massa and Asko were suspended yesterday at DM170.50 and DM790
respectively.
The offer is one share in Asko in exchange for four shares in Massa. The
Asko shares will come from Metro's own holding in the company.

jobs

CONTINENTAL Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, yesterday said it would
cut 2,500 full-time jobs, eliminate nine cities from its roster, and get rid
of several unprofitable routes after posting disappointing results for the
two months following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Mr Daniel Garton, Continental's chief financial officer, blamed the
company's tepid performance on continuing weakness in ticket prices. 'Our
results were in line with the rest of the industry but were still not good
enough. It is important that we are taking steps to return to profitability
and that we are willing to make the hard decisions.'
Continental plans to stop services to Australia and New Zealand at the end
of October, eliminating several unprofitable routes and closing its stations
in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Auckland.
It will also close its Vancouver station in October and its Puerto Plata
station in the Dominican Republic in September. In the US, it will close its
Spokane, Washington station, along with those at Bismarck and Minot, North
Dakota.
In addition, Continental is reducing services in some markets and
withdrawing altogether from its Denver - Milwaukee, Denver - Detroit and
Cleveland - Dallas routes.
The carrier will, however, continue to serve Milwaukee, Detroit and Dallas
through other hubs.
Continental, which emerged from Chapter 11 on April 28, posted an operating
loss of Dollars 4.2m on revenues of Dollars 975.9m for the two months to
June 30. The company had a net loss of Dollars 24.4m, or Dollars 1.45 a
share, in the period.
From April 1 to April 27, the predecessor company had an operating loss of
Dollars 58m on revenues of Dollars 476.9m. Net income for the period was
Dollars 2.75bn.
For the three months to June 30 1992, Continental made an operating loss of
Dollars 58m on revenues of Dollars 1.35bn. Its net loss in the quarter was
Dollars 99.2m.
When Continental presented its business plan to the bankruptcy court in
April, the company predicted operating losses of Dollars 181.2m for the
first four months but projected operating profits of Dollars 168.3m for the
period from May to December. Continental has not posted annual operating
profits since 1986.

FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Philips in electronic media move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to regroup its international
efforts in the field of consumer electronics 'software' as part of an
attempt to seize worldwide opportunities in the field of multi-media
education and entertainment.
It described the internal reorganisation as a first step to making Philips a
truly global competitor in electronic media. The core of the Dutch company's
revamped efforts in electronic media will be its New York-based Philips
Media unit.
The unit's creation earlier this year had already underlined the company's
heightened interest in producing and distributing 'software' to complement
consumer electronic 'hardware' such as televisions, video cassette recorders
(VCRs) and new products like compact disc-interactive.
Philips, Europe's largest manufacturer of consumer electronics, is trying to
emphasise high-margin software, such as video cassette rentals, as a way of
countering the narrow margins and fierce price wars in the sale of VCRs and
compact disc players.
In its new guise, Philips Media will bring together the group's existing
international and national programmes in interactive media into one
organisation. The new organisation, Philips Media Electronic Publishing,
will aim to grow in target markets such as children's electronic publishing
and the production of electronic games and home entertainment packages.
'I believe the company's new structure will enable us to be both responsive
and proactive in this rapidly changing world of electronic media,' Mr Scott
Marden, chief executive officer of Philips Media, said.
Mr Marden added that one of the unit's prime tasks is to enable Philips to
pursue opportunities with other big media companies. Philips Media's
interests include a minority stake in Whittle Communications of the US,
which is active in television programmes broadcast to US schools, and
Blockbuster, the US video rental chain.
The strengthening of Philips Media in New York is also part of a trend
towards locating Philips management closer to major markets and away from
the group's base in the Dutch town of Eindhoven. Earlier this summer,
Philips said it was moving the headquarters of its audio business from
Eindhoven to Singapore

three-fold jump in half-year pre-tax profit to a record NKr1.62bn (Dollars
216.9m) from NKr555m last year, helped by substantial gains on shares and
bonds. The company's A shares closed down NKr1 to NKr70 after hitting a high
of NKr73 on news of the improved performance.
Group premium income rose in the half-year by NKr226m to NKr1.7bn as gross
financial income shot up to NKr2.49bn from NKr1.47bn. Operating expenses
were largely unchanged at NKr289m.
The group's share portfolio was valued at NKr3.7bn.

KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, reported lower post-tax profits in
the three months to July with core discount stores remaining under pressure
and losses growing on its Pace membership warehouse operation.
But the company's shares edged up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 before the
close in New York as Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said
earnings in the second half were expected to exceed last year's levels.
The renewed strength in consumer spending and good weather, as well as the
company's own promotional activities, had brought about an improvement in
sales, he said.
Net income for the second quarter, at Dollars 102m, or 22 cents a share, was
down more than one-third from Dollars 168m, or 37 cents, a year ago.
The company, which is in the process of revamping many of its stores to
compete with the faster-growing Wal Mart, had warned at the end of June of a
likely fall in profits.
Sales in the core general merchandise area in the US grew to Dollars 6.6bn,
or nearly 5 per cent up on a year ago on a comparable basis. However,
operating income in the area fell by just under 13 per cent, to Dollars
259m, as the sales mix in the US discount stores tilted towards lower-margin
goods. This reflected lower sales of higher-maring clothing, due to bad
weather, Kmart said. This pushed the company's gross margin down to 23.3 per
cent from 23.9 per cent.
Pace, the company's troubled warehouse chain, suffered an operating loss of
Dollars 39m, including the cost of selling or closing 17 stores during the
period. This compared with a Dollars 24m loss in the first quarter. Also,
interest costs rose to Dollars 78m from Dollars 59m a year ago on extra debt
associated with acquisitions and higher inventory levels.
First-half net income fell to Dollars 152m, or 33 cents a share, before
special items, from Dollars 284m, or 62 cents, the year before.
Sales grew by 10 per cent, to Dollars 19.2bn.

advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the largest and most aggressive of Germany's public
sector banks, reported yesterday that first-half group operating profits
increased by nearly 24 per cent to DM280.6m (Dollars 163.1m).
The increase was achieved despite a substantial increase in provisions
against bad and doubtful debts. Mr Friedel Neuber, the bank's chief
executive, predicted full-year figures would exceed last year's result
despite the prolonged German recession and continuing difficulties in the
world economy.
The bank, the 'house' bank to the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, is,
according to some measures, the third-largest in Germany, in all areas of
business a strong rival to Germany's 'big three' commercial banks. The rate
of increase in first-half profits at WestLB was higher than at Deutsche
Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. In recent weeks they reported increases
in profits of 13, 14 and 16 per cent respectively.
German banks as a whole have profited from rising German bond and equity
markets as well as currency market turmoil and hectic derivatives trading.
As in the private commercial banking sector, WestLB's profits growth
reflects performance in own-account trading together with fee-income
generated from securities business. The bank also had a strong increase in
profits from interest income generated from the mainstream lending business
 -for the private sector institutions growth rates were more anaemic.
WestLB's profits from own-account trading more than doubled to DM190.7m  -
up by DM101m over the comparable period in the previous year.
WestLB, like other German banks, makes its calculations with reference to
half the profit made in the whole of the previous year - not the actual
profits for the first six months of last year. Fee income rose by 12.6 per
cent to DM230.4m and interest income climbed by nearly 16 per cent to
DM1.33bn.
Like other German banks, WestLB disclosed for the first time the scale of
its bad and doubtful debt provisions. These were DM468.8m in the first half,
43 per cent up on last year's comparable DM326.3m. This reflects the sharp
deterioration in the credit environment in Germany's worst economic downturn
since the second world war.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Takare improves to Pounds 6.58m - Care in
the Community Act has limited impact on occupancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKARE, the largest UK nursing home operator, yesterday reported a 16.8 per
cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, excluding exceptional items, to Pounds
6.58m.
The period, to end-June, covered the implementation on April 1 of the Care
in the Community Act which shifted the burden of public funding of nursing
home patients from central to local government.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the effect of the reforms had been to
reduce occupancy levels from 98 to 97 per cent. Takare's success during this
period led him 'to view our prospects with a greater degree of optimism than
ever before'.
He said that local authorities had now got the clinical and financial
procedures in place to handle admissions. Local authority admissions,
depressed partly by a rush of patients into homes before April 1, had
totalled 36 in April, 41 in May, 79 in June and 107 in July. The July total
had already been achieved in August, he said.
Turnover rose 65 per cent to Pounds 34.9m, and operating profits on
continuing businesses rose 73 per cent to Pounds 8.27m.
A 45 bed home was sold during the period for Pounds 712,000, giving a profit
of Pounds 370,000 included as an exceptional item. Another home, the only
one remaining in Takare's portfolio which does not conform to its
purpose-built standard, is being actively marketed. It has 120 beds and is
expected to raise substantially more than the other sale.
Takare paid interest of Pounds 1.7m, compared to interest receivable of
Pounds 838,000, after capitalising Pounds 985,000 (Pounds 2m).
The group opened 480 beds and another 450 are due to be commissioned in the
second half, to give a year end total of 5,220. Mr Bradshaw said by the end
of 1994 there would be 6,600 beds in operation and another 1,400 under
construction.
Mr Bradshaw said the construction programme was biased towards the second
half and total capital spending for the year would be similar to the Pounds
40.9m spent in the whole of 1992.
During the half year, the group spent Pounds 14.1m on fixed assets, reducing
cash by Pounds 7.4m. The balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 45.2m
(Pounds 37.8m at the year end) to give gearing of 46 per cent (41 per cent).
Next month Takare is freed from a promise not to issue equity for two years.
Mr Bradshaw emphasised the company had cash of over Pounds 5m and undrawn
bank facilities of Pounds 45m, and could continue its expansion programme
until the second quarter of 1995 before needing to raise more money,
although if that option was pursued it would push gearing towards 100 per
cent.
Earnings per share were 6.6p excluding the exceptional profit or 7p
including it (5.7p). The interim dividend goes up from 0.6p to 0.7p.
COMMENT
The nursing home sector of the stock market is now worth Pounds 600m, with
Takare the leading force. Its results, like those last week of Westminster
Health Care, the number two, are encouraging in that the April 1 reforms
seem to have had little serious effect on operations even in the short term.
In the longer term, Takare and its like should benefit from the changes,
providing the right cost/quality combination to local authority purchasers.
As the sector expands, though, there will be some sorting out. Takare is one
of the better placed, and on forecasts of about Pounds 14.2m excluding
exceptionals, the shares are on a prospective p/e of 16.6 which is still
good value.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik joint owner surprises with sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE DAYS after trading started in Bakyrchik Gold, a company set up to
exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, one of the previous joint owners,
Chilewich, a New York-based trading organisation, has sold virtually all its
25 per cent stake.
The sale took the market by surprise - there was no hint of it in documents
issued in connection with the Pounds 9m placing by Williams de Broe - but BK
Gold's share price remained steady after the news at 140p, a 17 per cent
premium to the placing price.
Chilewich is understood to have been under some pressure from its bankers
and sold at 128p a share to raise Pounds 3.8m to pay off bank debt.
The shares went to institutions who had had their applications scaled down
in the original placing.
Minproc, the Australian resources and engineering group which was BK Gold's
other joint owner, also sold some shares - 560,000 received from Chilewich
as part of its disposal and 190,000 from its own holding  - to raise nearly
Pounds 1m to fund costs incurred in bringing BK Gold to the market.
Minproc still owns 23.7 per cent of BK Gold and has no intention of
disposing of any more shares for at least a year.
Mr David Hooker, BK Gold chairman, said the Chilewich shares were placed
last week when it was clear that demand at the placing was unsatisfied.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: LGW 23% ahead with Pounds 538,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LGW, the USM-quoted marketing and luxury goods group which distributes
Pierre Cardin Sun Care products, lived up to its projections with a 23 per
cent increase in pre-tax profit for the six months ended June 30.
The result was achieved by close attention to margins, overheads and stock
levels, the company said.
Profit for the first half was Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 438,000) on turnover
slightly lower at Pounds 6.76m to Pounds 6.74m.
Earnings per share came out at 6.3p (5.2p) and there will be an increased
interim dividend of 1.6p (1.125p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Campbell &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, returned to the
black in the three months to June 30.
The Manchester-based group has changed its financial year-end from March to
December to 'balance the seasonal influences of activities over the two
halves'.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 81,000 compared with losses of Pounds 553,000 last
time and a deficit of Pounds 3.55m for the last full year.
Mr Ray Chambers, chairman, attributed the recovery to reduced overheads and
the disposal or closure 'of those businesses judged incapable of making a
positive contribution'.
Current order books were improving in shopfitting and manufacturing
operations, but remained under pressure in construction activities, Mr
Chambers said.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.8m, up from Pounds 12.6m which included a
contribution of Pounds 442,000 from discontinued operations.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.6p (losses of 3.8p).
The group did not declare an interim dividend.

<TEXT>
A DROP in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 818,000, was
announced by Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted shipping and distribution
group, for the half year to March 31.
Mr Chris Roth, chairman, said that trade in the second half had so far shown
signs of improvement. He said that following an initial bedding-in period
the modernisation of the Northfleet terminal would increase profitability.
There was an upturn in steel imports in late-February which had been
maintained, but it came too late to affect the half year result.
Turnover fell from Pounds 9.52m to Pounds 9.09m and there were reduced
operating profits of Pounds 472,000 (Pounds 669,000). Earnings per share
fell to 5.62p (7.34p) basic and 5.49p (6.88p) fully diluted.
The interim dividend is lifted to 2.3p (2p).

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoars to sell major stake in Hoskins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BARRIE Hoar, chairman of Hoskins Brewery, which is facing its second
shareholders' rebellion within a year, said yesterday that his family had
decided to sell a majority of its 30 per cent shareholding.
He announced the decision as the USM-quoted Leicester real ale brewer
reported a 16 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds
96,226 (Pounds 83,060).
Mr Hoar described the 12 months to end-March as a period of 'turmoil in the
marketplace'.
At the operating level profits declined from Pounds 214,749 to Pounds
148,701 on turnover 30 per cent lower at Pounds 1.22m. Earnings per share
rose 28 per cent to 1.77p.
The company, which disposed of nine of its pubs in October last year for
Pounds 2.45m, now had cash balances of about Pounds 850,000, Mr Hoar said.
Interest charges declined from Pounds 137,932 to Pounds 84,123 while
interest income rose from Pounds 6,243 to Pounds 31,648.
The accounts included an extraordinary charge of Pounds 35,254 (Pounds
63,126) for the costs of defending last year's unsuccessful attempt by a
number of shareholders to remove Mr Hoar and his brother, Robert, from the
board.
Other dissident shareholders, led by Mr Richard Holman, who has a 7.4 per
cent holding, have now called for an extraordinary meeting in a further
attempt to remove the two directors.
Mr Barrie Hoar said yesterday that attacks from dissident shareholders had
disrupted efforts to reposition the company. As a result, the Hoar family
would sell a majority of its shareholding provided it could ensure that new
management would be in the long term interest of all shareholders.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Benson doubles to Pounds 1.92m with help
from acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped Benson Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, double
annual profits but Mr Richard Phillips, chairman, warned that although there
had been some upturn, the pattern of demand was uneven.
Pre-tax profits over the year to May 31 were Pounds 1.92m, against Pounds
915,000.
Turnover increased to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 12.6m).
The sharp rises reflected the purchase in March 1992 of the Thama group of
companies, a move which effectively doubled the size of the group.
Earnings per share of 1.45p showed a 33 per cent increase. The proposed
final dividend is 0.2p, bringing the total to 0.3p (0.1p).
Earnings were sustained by a low tax charge, following on the tax losses
which have been carried forward since Mr Phillips and his management team
took over three years ago. Benson carries forward into its new year Pounds
7m of tax losses.
The main thrust to increased profits came from the engineered components
division, but the performance of the environmental control and vehicle
engineering division was slugg-ish.
During the current year, this pattern is likely to be repeated although Mr
Phillips said he expected margins would improve in the environmental control
and vehicle engineering divisions.
He noted that the group was not heavily exposed to continental European
markets.
Since the year end, Benson has sold Wolverhampton Pressings to Ralph
Martindale for Pounds 450,000.

WB INDUSTRIES, the West Bromwich-based spring maker whose shares were
suspended at 10p last November, reduced pre-tax losses for the year to
December from Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 795,000.
Turnover fell to Pounds 6.99m (Pounds 9.67m).
Losses per share were 12.38p against 70.83p after an extraordinary charge of
Pounds 3.65m.
The company said it still relied heavily on bank support.
Its recovery 'will be slow, taking two to three years to see the property
assets contributing materially to profits and cashflow.'
The spring business should return to profit next year, it said.

boost in Europe and US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S Holdings, the auction house, more than doubled pre-tax profits
from a recession-induced low of Dollars 9.09m to Dollars 19.1m (Pounds
12.6m), in the six months to June 30.
The group is controlled by the Detroit-based Taubman family but is still
quoted in London and New York.
Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive officer, ascribed the
profits advance both to the rise in the auction sales volume in Europe and
the US and to the increase in the buyers' premium.
Previously, buyers and sellers were charged 10 per cent of the hammer price
on all lots sold; since January 1, buyers have paid 15 per cent on the
initial Pounds 30,000 of all purchases and thereafter 10 per cent.
Operating income from auctions leapt to Dollars 17.4m (Dollars 6.41m) on
revenues of Dollars 114.5m (Dollars 101m). Pre-tax income from auctions
totalled Dollars 19m (Dollars 9.05m).
Also real estate profits grew to Dollars 1.36m (Dollars 913,000). However,
income from financial services declined to Dollars 1.45m (Dollars 1.82m)
'principally due to the lower revenues associated with a smaller loan
portfolio', which has been reduced in line with the general economic as well
as art market conditions.
Corporate operating expenses swelled to Dollars 3.06m (Dollars 2.72m).
Earnings expanded from 10 cents to 21 cents per share.
Auction sales were ahead 31 per cent at Pounds 418m, or 12 per cent at
Dollars 635m allowing for a Dollars 40.5m reduction for adverse currency
exchange rates.
The renewed activity had come from both buyers and sellers, said Mr Ainslie.
This time 40 lots were sold for more than Dollars 1m, against 33 last time.
Impressionist and Modern art increased sales from Dollars 72.4m to Dollars
135.5m, with one painting by Cezanne - Nature Morte: Les Grosses Pommes -
fetching a record Dollars 28.6m.
Jewellery also saw 'significantly improved sales'.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: HM launches rights and buys epos maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
METRIC, a privately-owned UK company manufacturing electric point of sale
terminals in Poland, is to be acquired by HM Holdings, a shell company, for
between Pounds 700,000 and Pounds 4m in shares and warrants, depending on
future profits.
HM yesterday announced a 6-for-1 rights issue raising between Pounds 500,000
and Pounds 2.1m, with an opportunity for investors to apply for a bigger
number of shares and warrants.
The warrants carry an entitlement to subscribe for shares at 1p between
August 1 1994 and January 31 1996.
The new company, to be renamed Metric Components, will seek to come to the
market in the future.
HM has tax losses and some sizeable shareholders such as the Imperial
Tobacco Pension Fund.
Mr Job Maats, who founded Metric and will head the new company, said: 'We
have a very skilled workforce who cost about a tenth of employees with
similar skills working in the M4 corridor or in Silicon Valley.'
With the closure of Polish steel factories and mines Mr Maats said Polish
workers were 'very keen to work for realistic prices'.
Metric, which employs 500 people in Poland, has been granted an option on
the factory in the Silesia valley by the ministry of privatisation,
exercisable within two years.
While the epos terminals for the retail industry are manufactured in Poland,
the software is produced in England.
The initial consideration, comprising 70m ordinary shares and 70m warrants,
is Pounds 700,000.
Up to an additional 330m ordinary shares and 330m warrants will be issued if
Metric meets certain profit targets.
It either has to make Pounds 500,000 in the year to June 1994, or a bigger
sum the following year to be eligible for the additional shares and
warrants.
Mr Maats has personally warranted that the average pre-tax profits of Metric
for the next two years will not be less than Pounds 125,000 and has
undertaken to pay any shortfall up to a maximum of Pounds 125,000.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: ADT hit by absence of exceptional income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the security and vehicle auctions group which recently completed a
Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 830m) restructuring, yesterday reported a 9 per cent
decline in interim pre-tax profits to Dollars 68.7 on net sales marginally
higher at Dollars 678.8m.
The decline over the six months to end-June was largely due to the absence
of exceptional gains which had flattered 1992's profits by Dollars 15.5m. At
the operating level, ADT reported a 9 per cent increase to Dollars 97.6m.
Net income fell by 20 per cent to Dollars 58.4m, after an Pounds 8m rise in
the tax charge to Dollars 10.3m.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, said the successful conclusion of the
refinancing earlier this month meant the group now had 'a stable long-term
financial structure which will allow the group to continue to develop its
two businesses'.
The security services division showed a 7 per cent increase in operating
income to Dollars 69.9m on sales 2 per cent higher at Dollars 452.9m. The
strongest advance was made in the residential business, with sales 38 per
cent ahead of the previous year.
Profits from the vehicle auctions division rose by 8 per cent to Dollars
42.1m on sales 2 per cent higher at Dollars 182.2m. Mr Ashcroft said vehicle
sales had risen in both the UK and US in the second quarter. In the US,
sales were 4 per cent higher. In the UK, higher prices due to a supply
shortage left volumes 6 per cent up.
Primary earnings per share fell from 57 cents to 45 cents.
ADT also announced yesterday that it intended to redeem its outstanding
exchangeable redeemable preference shares at the end of next month. More
than 90 per cent of the total had already been exchanged for BAA shares, the
group said.
The redemption value of the preference shares was Dollars 10.6m. If
exchanged into BAA shares, the stock would be worth approximately Dollars
19m.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: RTZ Pillar up for sale to help focus on
mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL YESTERDAY, the RTZ Corporation had never publicly admitted that the
diverse group of companies gathered together under the RTZ Pillar banner was
up for sale.
Yet for years it has been clear that there was no place for Pillar if RTZ -
as it promised - was to concentrate on its core business.
RTZ's strategy is a simple one: it wants a share in as many of the world's
top-class mines as possible - and Pillar's motley collection of downstream
industrial products certainly does not fit this bill.
This strategic emphasis was clear even before RTZ in 1989 became the world's
biggest mining group with the Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2bn) purchase of most of
British Petroleum's mineral and mining assets.
Pillar contributes most of RTZ's UK profits. Turnover of Pillar last year
was Pounds 1.42bn but it produced only Pounds 17m of net attributable
profits compared with a peak contribution of Pounds 162m in 1988. The
following year the UK recession began to take its toll, and Pillar was
always among the first businesses to suffer in an economic downturn. Since
then the Pillar management has been 'restructuring to match capacity with
demand' and the workforce has been cut by 7,000 to about 18,000.
Although RTZ insists its policies are never tax-driven, there were good tax
reasons for keeping those remaining UK earnings. However, if the UK
government goes ahead with plans to change the present corporate tax system
which discriminates against companies like RTZ with substantial overseas
earnings, the rationale for retaining Pillar will have gone completely.
RTZ acquired Pillar Industries in 1970. Pillar was a large user of aluminium
for castings and RTZ was a big supplier of the metal in the UK so it was
argued that the two made a good fit.
In 1988 the business took a leap forward with the acquisition of MK Electric
for Pounds 260m - after an aggressive dawn raid that netted 20 per cent of
MK. Three smaller electrical companies were acquired for Pounds 23m shortly
afterwards. The explanation for this expense was that MK's electrical
products would dovetail with Pillar's business for making aluminium, steel,
glass and plastic products for the construction industry.
Pillar's best-known business, apart from MK, was Everest double glazing  -
but this was sold to MB-Caradon in 1988 for Pounds 80m. However, RTZ
recently picked up the name and some assets of the Alpine double glazing
business which is in receivership.
There are four operating subsidiaries within Pillar: building products,
engineering, electrical and Indal Industries.
Building products supplies the housing and construction industries in the
UK, Portugal, Italy and Denmark with products including steel lintels,
aluminium and wooden windows, steel and plastic cladding and DIY equipment.
Last year it contributed Pounds 10.6m of net profit, up from Pounds 9.7m.
Engineering provides products and services to the aviation, automotive and
general engineering industries in the UK. Net profit last year was down from
Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 8m.
Electrical produces a wide range of electrical goods including wiring
devices, power distribution systems, security and safety systems, doorbells,
emergency lighting and building management systems. Net profits last year
were down from Pounds 24m to Pounds 18.5m.
Indal is a diversified industrial company supplying doors and windows,
glass, zinc, steel, aluminium, vinyl and wood products, cladding systems and
automotive components in North America. Its net losses last year increased
from Pounds 5m to Pounds 9m.
There is no guarantee that any deal will be worked out with MB-Caradon but,
now it is widely known that Pillar is up for sale, there should be no
shortage of offers. RTZ likes to drive a hard bargain when selling assets so
whether an acceptable offer comes along remains to be seen.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Two distribution disposals at BM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROGRAMME of dispos-als and debt reduction continued at BM Group
yesterday, as the engineering concern announced the sale of BM Plant and
Talbot Diesels, its UK distribution businesses, to a management team.
The move is part of BM's plan to shed all or part of its interests in
construction equipment distribution worldwide. The group has borrowings in
excess of Pounds 100m and has had its banking facilities extended until
September 6.
While BM will receive only Pounds 850,000 cash from the disposals - and
Pounds 200,000 of that is deferred for one year - the borrowings of the two
companies, which amounted to Pounds 4.27m at June 30, are being retained by
them. So the disposals will knock some Pounds 5m from group debt.
The buyer is Halliard, shareholders of which include some of the present
directors and managers of BM Plant and Talbot. These include Mr GJ Hall, a
director of BM. He will resign that post and will receive no compensation.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Argos jumps 38% to Pounds 13.2m - Move to
selling by mail order being considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGOS, the catalogue shopping group, said yesterday it was examining a
'number of options' for diversification and hinted that a move into direct
mail order selling might be a possibility.
Argos' venture into furniture retailing through its Chesterman chain proved
to be a costly error as customer demand failed to meet expectations, and
Chesterman was closed in March. But Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said the
company was still keen to extend its retail activities into areas
'consistent with our competence'.
If Argos failed to find a suitable opportunity for expansion or acquisition
it had not ruled out redistributing some of its cash reserves to
shareholders in the form of higher dividends, he added.
His comments came as the group revealed a 38 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.2m.
Mr Smith said the company had seen a fragile recovery in consumer confidence
and total sales in the 24 weeks to June 19 were up 10.3 per cent to Pounds
366m (Pounds 332m).
Stripping out the effect of seven new store openings, however, the
like-for-like sales increase was 5.9 per cent.
Mr Smith said much of this increase was due to 'management initiatives,
including the conversion of its remaining 'Best Sellers' stores, which
previously carried only a limited range, to a full range, and changes to its
catalogue.
Last year's pre-tax figure of Pounds 9.5m included a Pounds 2.25m loss at
the Chesterman furniture chain. Excluding that loss, the profit increase was
11.9 per cent.
Although profits were in the mid-range of analysts' forecasts of between
Pounds 12m and Pounds 14m, the share price slipped 10p to 328p.
Analysts said the City was worried that Argos faced higher costs, and
pressure on its gross margin.
Mr Smith said the gross margin last year increased by 0.25 percentage
points, thanks to increased sales of higher margin items such as furniture
and jewellery.
However, he admitted that growing price competition in UK retailing would
'drive gross margins down'.
The interim dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2.2p), while earnings rose from
2.08p to 2.93p.
Interest income fell slightly due to lower interest rates, but this was
partly offset by an increase in average cash balances to Pounds 112m (Pounds
88m).
Mr Smith said Argos planned to open a further 25 stores this year, taking
the total to 322. It has an eventual target of about 600 stores.

FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Aminex heads for Siberian oil fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government has taken an indirect stake in a small Irish oil
exploration company in a move designed to open up Siberian oil fields frozen
by years of neglect.
Aminex, the exploration tiddler which recently lost its hostile battle for
fellow exploration group Tuskar Resources, said yesterday it expected to
announce within weeks a deal to rebuild a Siberian oil field.
The group's shares rose sharply on the news, defying the market trend, and
closed 25 per cent higher at 37 1/2 p.
It also emerged yesterday that Zarubezhneftj (Russian Foreign Trade
Corporation), a state-owned body, indirectly owned 17 per cent of Aminex
through its 49 per cent stake in East West Oil. East West, a private company
controlled by Russian shareholders, owns more then 34 per cent of Aminex.
Mr Brian Hall, chairman of Aminex, said he thought it was the first time the
Russian body had invested in a western company. Zarubezhneftj is responsible
for procuring oilfield equipment for the Russian Ministry of Fuel and
energy, and oversees the government's foreign exploration.
Aminex has appointed Mr Alexander Sarukhanov, deputy director general of
Zarubezhneftj and a petroleum engineer, as a non-executive director. Mr
Sarukhanov was closely involved with Russia's oil production joint venture
with the Vietnamese government.
Mr Hall said Aminex would not be exploring in Siberia. Instead, it would
rebuild the infrastructure of existing fields relying heavily on
subcontracting. 'So much production has been shut in through neglect,' Mr
Hall said.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Salomon stock rises as Warren Buffett lifts stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Salomon, the US securities house and energy group, rose sharply
yesterday on the news that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who
masterminded Salomon's recovery from the debilitating effects of the 1991
Treasury auction scandal, is raising his stake to at least 15 per cent.
Although Mr Buffett would only be raising his stake by a small amount - he
already owns 14.3 per cent of the company in the form of convertible
preferred stock and he has a long-standing agreement not to raise that to
more than 20 per cent until October 1994 - the notification that he plans to
add to his holdings was seen as a vote of confidence in Salomon.
The news prompted heavy buying of the company's shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, and the price rose Dollars 2 1/4 to close at Dollars 48.
Analysts said that the rise in Salomon's share price yesterday was a
reflection of Mr Buffett's influence in the markets. Mr John Keefe,
brokerage analyst with Keefe Worldwide Services, said that because Mr
Buffett was known as a successful investor and because of his close links
with Salomon, 'his actions will prompt others to buy the stock'.
Mr Buffett, a member of Salomon's board, is not the only senior company
figure to bet his own money on Salomon's future. Last week, Mr Deryck
Maughan, chairman of the firm's brokerage unit Salomon Brothers, was
reported to have spent Dollars 1m on 25,000 Salomon shares one week after
the company reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars 433m (Pounds
290m).
This was also seen as a sign that senior Salomon management believe the
company has fully recovered from the 1991 scandal, which cost the company
several top executives, heavy fines and government restrictions on its
brokerage activities, plus the temporary loss of customers.
Mr Buffett's plans for his stake in Salomon are closely followed on Wall
Street because of the role he played at the company after the scandal.
During his one-year stint as interim chairman, Mr Buffett helped restructure
top management, changed internal policies, and reduced reliance on profits
from speculative bond trading by emphasising its customer-related business.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Argos says Budget may kill recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGOS chairman Mr David Donne yesterday issued a warning to Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, that any tax increases in his November Budget could
destroy the 'fragile' recovery in consumer confidence and devastate
retailers' profits.
His warning came as the catalogue retailer revealed a 39 per cent rise in
profits to Pounds 13.2m for the 24 weeks to June 19, on sales up 10.3 per
cent to Pounds 365.9m.
Mr Donne highlighted the threat posed to retailers by the decision to move
the Budget from March to November. He warned any increase in income tax or
value added tax could snuff out improvement in consumer confidence. Some
retailers make 90 per cent of their profits during the Christmas and new
year trading period.
'Relative growth in sales is getting stronger but it is slow and fragile,'
he said. 'Increasing taxes in the Budget could have a serious impact on the
all-important Christmas trading period.'
Argos said sales were on a 'gentle upward trend', and had increased
throughout the first half. Trading was still stronger in the north than in
the south of England, but the gap was narrowing.
Excluding the impact of newly opened stores, sales had increased 5.9 per
cent, but much of this was due to 'management initiatives' including
expanding the range of some of its stores and changes to its catalogues.
Argos estimated the underlying increase in consumer spending at 1.8 per
cent, against a 0.9 per cent fall in the first half of 1992, and a 1 per
cent increase in the second half.

FT  17 AUG 93 / MB-Caradon in talks with RTZ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN MB-Caradon rose 16p to 303p yesterday after the building materials
group confirmed it was involved in preliminary discussions to buy a large
part of Pillar, the industrial products division of the RTZ Corporation.
Caradon's share price has been weak recently because of investor uncertainty
about how it would spend the Pounds 428m cash pile it received from the sale
in April of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the French packaging
group.
RTZ's price was virtually unchanged. The disposal of Pillar has been widely
expected because RTZ says it wants to concentrate on its core mining
business - it is the world's biggest mining company.
Neither side yesterday would go beyond a brief statement issued at the
insistence of the London Stock Exchange after news of the talks was leaked
to Sunday newspapers. The leaks suggest that a price of Pounds 750m to
Pounds 800m might be paid, depending on how many Pillar operations Caradon
acquires.
It is thought the talks have yet to cover some significant issues and might
fall through. However, some analysts expect a quick conclusion, possibly as
early as next week.
At the time of Caradon's sale of its CMB stake, Mr Peter Jansen, chief
executive, said his group favoured a big acquisition in one of its core
areas and that it could afford to spend up to Pounds 1bn. Some analysts
suggested yesterday Caradon could finance the Pillar deal partly by equity.
The group's last rights issue was in November 1991 at 205p a share.
Although RTZ recently spent nearly Pounds 900m on coal assets in the US it
insisted yesterday that it was in no urgent need of cash. Following the sale
of oil, gas and gold assets from Nerco, one of the acquisitions, RTZ's
gearing was not uncomfortably high, an official said.
MB-Caradon's building products activities include bathroom products such as
Doulton, Twyford and Mira, heating such as Stelrad radiators, Everest double
glazing, and plastic products including Terrain drainpipes.
Pillar operates via four subsidiaries: building products, engineering,
electrical and Indal, a diversified industrial company. Turnover was Pounds
1.4bn last year and net attributable earnings Pounds 17m, far below the peak
contribution of Pounds 162m in 1988. Indal has been suffering losses and
analysts suggested that it might be excluded from the Caradon deal.

FT  17 AUG 93 / AT&amp;T mobilises with record telecoms deal: Andrew Adonis
explains why the US industry leader is splashing out on McCaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In June British Telecommunications hailed its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn)
purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the second largest US operator, as
the 'telecommunications deal of the century'. Barely two months later AT&amp;T,
the US giant itself, has trumped BT with a Dollars 12bn-plus takeover of
McCaw Cellular Communications, one of the leading US mobile phone companies.
The size of the deal - the fifth largest in US corporate history - is a
shock, but not its nature. AT&amp;T is anxious to re-enter the cellular market,
in which it has not played a part as an operator since the break-up of the
old Bell company in 1984. Last November it announced an agreement to take a
one-third stake in McCaw, with an option to take a majority holding in due
course.
Cellular subscriber numbers are taking off across the developed world, as
mobile phones are marketed as a consumer product for the first time. At the
end of 1992 the number of US cellular subscribers was estimated to have
reached 11m, a growth of 46 per cent over the year, according to the FT's
Mobile Communications newsletter. Revenues from cellular services were
Dollars 7.8bn, 38 per cent up on 1991. Growth is expected to be lower this
year, but subscriber numbers are likely to increase by more than a third.
Mr Bob Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, says: 'Wireless communications services are
absolutely central to AT&amp;T's networking strategy and key to the company's
future earnings growth.'
McCaw is an obvious target for AT&amp;T. Although heavily indebted and still
loss-making, it is the cellular operator with the largest metropolitan
population coverage in the US. It is not a fixed-line operator, so poses no
obviously insurmountable regulatory hurdles. Under Mr Craig McCaw, its
energetic chairman and founder, it has a go-ahead reputation upon which Mr
Allen is keen to capitalise.
BT owns a stake of 17-18 per cent in McCaw, which it will sell to AT&amp;T as
part of the deal. Despite their international rivalry, AT&amp;T is not motivated
by any special desire to drive BT out of the US mobile market. AT&amp;T's
agreement to buy BT's stake pre-dates BT's purchase of its MCI holding; and
the bill for MCI made BT still keener to sell its McCaw shares.
Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst with Goldman Sachs, believes
two factors decided Mr Allen to go the whole hog at once. First,
'negotiations with Craig McCaw seemed to have reached a bit of an impasse,
and both of them recognised that using AT&amp;T's brand name and marketing was
likely to add the most value.'
Second, 'AT&amp;T saw McCaw's shares appreciating sharply because of what they
wanted to do with the company, and they did not want to have pay still more
further down the track.'
Yesterday, however, Mr Allen was at great pains to stress what AT&amp;T did not
intend to do with McCaw. 'We are not interested in re-entering the local
telephone business: 99 per cent of all cellular calls go through local
telephone companies, and it will be years, if ever, before that changes.'
Insofar as cellular communications are still not remotely price competitive
with fixed-wire local networks, Mr Allen is stating the obvious. Indeed, new
digital networks have pushed handset prices sharply up in the short-term,
and non-business usage is still low.
Furthermore, there are no obvious regulatory hurdles which might lead AT&amp;T
to play down its local ambitions. The 'Baby Bell' companies will renew their
complaints about their exclusion from the long-distance market, but the 1984
divestiture left AT&amp;T free to operate in the cellular business, although it
will have to apply to the Federal Communications Commission to transfer the
operating licence in states where cellular is regulated.
However, cellular is undeniably an alternative to fixed-line local networks,
and one set to become more significant as mobile telephony spreads and its
costs reduce. AT&amp;T's rivals may rightly fear its potential in the wireless
business - not least through its capacity to market cellular services as
part of 'all-in' packages for businesses and residential customers.
To that extent, the McCaw takeover also highlights AT&amp;T's problem as a
potential competitor to its own customers. As a telecommunications
manufacturer AT&amp;T is a principal supplier to the regional Bell companies.
More specifically, it is the leading supplier of cellular infrastructure to
them and entered the handset market 18 months ago. Until now the Baby Bells,
which have carved up much of the cellular market between them, have not seen
AT&amp;T as a 'mobile predator'. If they do, their enthusiasm for its wares may
wane.
For BT, yesterday's deal offers a more graceful exit from the US cellular
market than it expected last year. At AT&amp;T's current stock price, the value
of BT's McCaw stake is up to Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 1.8bn last year,
although it will not be able to realise the gain until the 1994-95 financial
year.
It nevertheless closes a less than glorious episode in BT's
post-privatisation history. BT paid Dollars 1.5bn for its stake in 1989,
trumpeting its ambition to become 'world leader' in mobile communications
and the need to diversify away from its regulated, recession-prone markets
in the UK.
Four years years later, BT is retiring from the US cellular market with a
cash gain which looks distinctly modest compared with the 16.5 to 18.5 per
cent cost of capital it is permitted on its regulated business under its
current agreement with Oftel, the UK industry regulator.
As for 'world leader', BT's only remaining cellular activity of note is
Cellnet, its UK joint venture with Securicor. Unlike its UK competitor
Vodafone, Cellnet has been barred by its parents from investing overseas. If
world leaders in tomorrow's telecommunications industry need to be mobile,
AT&amp;T is out in front.

FT  17 AUG 93 / SE Banken up on rights talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the shares of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the Swedish bank,
was exceptionally heavy yesterday on expectations that the loss-making group
will today announce a large rights issue and much improved financial figures
for the second quarter.
The bank is set to ask shareholders for as much as SKr6bn (Pounds 502.8m)
through a one-for-two share issue at SKr45 per share, according to one
report. This is a larger amount than earlier expected and should enable the
bank to survive its current difficulties without direct state support, say
analysts. The bank yesterday declined to comment.
A rights issue has been expected since the bank and the Swedish government
announced in June that the bank's owners would be called on to strengthen
the bank's capital base. Raising SKr6bn would boost the bank's international
capital adequacy ratio from 8.5 per cent at the end of the first quarter to
10.5-11 per cent, well above the minimum 8 per cent level.
Analysts say conditions for a rights issue are highly favourable given
falling Swedish interest rates and the surge in SE Banken's share price.
The shares have climbed nearly 10 times from SKr7 in April to SKr69
yesterday, after gaining new momentum at the end of last week as rumours of
a rights issue began to circulate. Turnover in the A shares amounted to
SKr198m on the Stockholm Stock Exchange yesterday.
An important consideration for the bank will be the extent to which its
leading shareholders agree to support the fund-raising to generate the wider
confidence required to make the issue a success. The main shareholders
include the Wallenberg family, with around 7 per cent, Trygg-Hansa SPP, the
insurance group, and Custos, the investment group.
Some analysts believe the bank could announce a near break-even result after
credit losses for the second quarter, which would keep losses for the first
half in the SKr500-700m range. In the first quarter, the bank announced an
SKr608m operating loss, down 55 per cent on the same 1992 period.

FT  17 AUG 93 / US credit card lender to set up HQ for Europe in Chester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 43m European headquarters is to be established in Chester by MBNA
America Bank, representing the largest US investment in the UK for three
years and creating up to 800 jobs.
The UK government is meeting 16 per cent of the bank's costs through a
Pounds 7m grant of regional selective assistance, Mr Tim Sainsbury, the
industry minister, announced yesterday. Such grants are available for
projects that offer new jobs.
MBNA, based in Newark, Delaware, is the second largest US lender on credit
cards, after Citibank, with a loan portfolio of Dollars 10.6bn (Pounds
7.2bn). It specialises in the issue of credit cards bearing the Mastercard
or Visa logo to groups with a common interest, such as teachers or
opticians.
The bank expects to employ 70 people by the end of this year and to create
the 800 jobs within five years. Measured on the basis of long-term
employment, this is the biggest US investment in the UK since 1990 when
Conner Peripherals, a computer company, set up in Scotland with the aim of
creating 1,500 jobs.
Figures from the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau
show that US companies accounted for 41 per cent of the 56,271 jobs linked
to inward investment decisions announced in 1992-93.
Between 1951 and 1991, when the pace of US investment abroad slackened, the
UK absorbed more than 36 per cent of direct US investment in the European
Community, according to the US Department of Commerce.
The first priority of MBNA will be to issue credit cards on the UK market,
but, the bank said, it would be seeking to expand sales in the EC.
MBNA narrowed the choice of a site to Chester or Dublin. It started
negotiations with Inward, the agency for investment in north- west England,
the local authorities and the DTI last December.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Japanese business calls on west to counter rising yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE business leaders yesterday called on the country's new government
to seek concerted international intervention to stop the yen's rise against
the dollar. They fear the yen's strength is threatening hopes of economic
recovery in Japan.
The yen yesterday broke through Y101 to the dollar for the first time in
London trading. After closing in Tokyo at Y101.25, the currency reached a
new postwar high of Y100.80 in European trading. It drifted back to close in
London at Y101.05, but there was speculation the currency would break
through the Y100 level this week. It eased to Y101.575 at the New York close
and opened at Y101.41 in Tokyo.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, Japan's main business
grouping, said the government should ask other economic powers to carry out
concerted intervention in foreign exchange markets. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, who
became finance minister in the coalition government formed last week, agreed
that the rise was 'too rapid' and said he was consulting other nations.
Central banks from Japan's partners in the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations have shown no inclination to join the Bank of Japan in attempting to
hold back the gains in the yen. The country's trade surplus is seen in the
west as too high to warrant doing anything to assist Japanese export
competitiveness.
But as Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC, the electronics manufacturer,
noted in a television interview last night, the economic slowdown leaves
industry few options but to pare costs where possible and redirect output to
products sought abroad.
Industrialists were encouraged yesterday by an upward revision in industrial
production data for June. The seasonally adjusted rise in output from May
was put at 1.9 per cent compared with an earlier estimate of 1.3 per cent.
On an unadjusted basis, output was down 4.6 per cent against June 1992, but
better than the 5.1 per cent fall initially indicated.
The ratio of inventories to sales was 1.1 per cent lower month-on-month,
against the original 1.2 per cent. Depressed consumer demand was again
evident in figures for July department store sales in the capital. These
were down 9.5 per cent from a year earlier for a 17th successive fall.

FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Argos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CBI surveys may suggest that most retailers are feeling more perky about
life, but conditions are barely good enough to raise a smile from the Argos
board. The company has seen trading conditions improve steadily through the
year, but management's eyes are relentlessly focused on the 25 per cent of
sales which fall in the five weeks up to Christmas. Large tax increases in
Mr Kenneth Clarke's November budget would depress consumer confidence in the
critical period - hence the company's nervousness yesterday.
Yet it would not do to get too gloomy. The advantages of last year's
catalogue changes and new sales formats will not drop away immediately.
There is unlikely to be a repeat of the jewellery price war of two years
ago, and the company continues to throw off cash despite the expansion of
its store chain.
In the longer term, Argos, in common with several other retailers, faces the
problem of what to do with its strong cash inflows and swelling cash pile.
After the Chesterman furniture fiasco, Argos will doubtless be cautious
about future diversification. Yet only a sizeable acquisition will absorb
much cash, and if no target is forthcoming, the company may consider
returning its excess equity. That might raise some cheer among shareholders
and support the shares, which otherwise are beginning to look somewhat
overstretched.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MB
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caradon's apparent difficulty in spending its cash shows how unwise it is to
conclude deals by means of semaphore. When MB - Caradon realised Pounds 473m
from selling its 25 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox in April, it flagged
its intent to reinvest the money in building materials products. Its
predatory presence steepened the cyclical upturn in the sector's shares.
Those of Marley, for example, widely tipped as a likely target, have shot up
from 58p last September to 166p.
It therefore comes as little surprise that MB - Caradon is trying to buy an
unquoted package of assets from RTZ, although it is not clear how much it
hopes to buy or what price it is prepared to pay. The 6 per cent rise in MB
 -Caradon's shares shows the market's faith that it will not do anything
silly. But it also reflects relief that the meagre returns earned from
leaving Pounds 370m on deposit may soon be ending. Failure to secure an
agreement could now result in some damage to MB - Caradon's shares but this
is no reason to press ahead if the terms are not right. Reuters has made it
respectable to return surplus cash to shareholders. It would be no shame on
MB - Caradon if it were to conclude the same.
As for RTZ, changes to the ACT regime may have reduced its need to preserve
UK earnings. The company is under no pressure to sell but the disposal would
usefully reduce gearing and may facilitate another big acquisition. Those
Whitehall boffins working out how to sell British Coal would doubtless be
delighted. They may have a hard job tempting RTZ, nonetheless.

FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the value of estate agents is a reflection of investing institutions'
view of the housing market, yesterday's disposal by Abbey National is
depressing news. Even allowing that the purchasers are getting a discount
for buying the whole Cornerstone chain, an average price per office of
Pounds 23,000 is well below that achieved by Prudential following its
decision to divest in 1990. Abbey was not alone in paying 10 times more per
office in the 1980s. That will be of scant consolation to shareholders now
faced with another Pounds 30m writedown to add to the Pounds 228m of losses
already announced.
Since estate agencies have proved to be unreliable sales outlets for
mortgage lenders or life insurers, it is hard to quibble with Abbey's
decision to sell. Provident Life will be hoping for better luck with a tied
agency agreement with the new owners in return for acquisition finance. In
theory, that should yield the same flow of life insurance business without
the capital risk while giving entrepreneurial managers their head. Legal &amp;
General is aiming for similar results through franchising.
Even as housing market turnover recovers, though, much depends on whether
sales of endowment mortgages are held back by the combination of public
suspicion and new commission disclosure requirements. Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester's decision to stop selling endowments underlined that the
economics are already finely balanced for some mortgage lenders. Without a
good flow of business from that direction, the already tattered argument for
marrying long-term savings and estate agency will be impossible to sustain.

FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: McCaw's sugar mommy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Dollars 12.3bn acquisition of McCaw has at
least the merit of tidiness. Instead of its original proposal which left
McCaw equity lying about in the market, AT&amp;T has swept up the entire
cellular company. A straight one-for-one share swap also makes the
accounting easy. Yet the deal has the feel of the property scramble which
accompanies the first few rounds of a Monopoly game. There are few strategic
telecoms properties up for sale around the world, and AT&amp;T has been prepared
to dilute its earnings significantly in order to acquire one of them.
Still, unless McCaw gives AT&amp;T some access to local telecoms in the longer
term, it will prove very difficult to justify the high price paid.
Experience with radio phones will doubtless be useful once new technologies
such as personal data notepads and multimedia are integrated with cellular
telephony. It also gives AT&amp;T another weapon in its armoury of managing
company telecom requirements. Yet such advantages will not, by themselves,
provide a decent return on the investment.
AT&amp;T's strategy seems to be to cast its net across many markets - from
computing to radio, Europe to China - in an effort to remain in the
forefront of a rapidly evolving information technology business. That may
make sense at present, but not even Ma Bell can afford such breadth for long
 -as its high gearing and yesterday's dilutive acquisition show. When it
narrows its focus, it will do well to remember that owning networks is
becoming a commodity business. It is the data which flows through them which
is valuable.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Bosnia factions agree UN control of Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of Bosnia's three warring factions last night agreed in
principle to place Sarajevo under temporary United Nations control in an
attempt to speed up a settlement of the 17-month conflict in the republic.
This means Sarajevo's fate is being put 'on ice' while the feuding Serbs,
Moslems and Croats negotiate a three-way carve-up of the rest of Bosnia on
ethnic lines.
The agreement, seen as a breakthrough for the international mediators, Lord
Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, came just hours after leaders of the
warring parties met at the negotiating table in Geneva for the first time in
two weeks.
Under the pact, to be finalised by a three-member committee, Sarajevo would
be demilitarised and become a virtual open city separate from the three
proposed ethnic mini-states. UN control would extend to the airport and many
of the strategic hills from which Serbs shell the city, but would not
encompass the nearby Serb stronghold of Pale.
However, the spokesman for the mediators, Mr John Mills, cautioned that many
problems still had to be resolved.
He said the committee would examine civilian policing, the setting up of a
body to liaise with the 'UN co-ordinator' and the functioning of municipal
and UN authorities. No limit has been fixed for the UN mandate, which
diplomats said would have to be agreed by the UN Security Council. 'We are
not talking about a final agreement here,' Mr Mills said. 'The devil is
always in the details.'
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg earlier this month proposed such an interim
settlement for Sarajevo in an effort to prevent deep differences over the
capital delaying an overall peace package.
Sarajevo is one of the most contested issues, as the Moslem-led government
has fought to keep control while the Serbs want to partition the city.
The three-member committee will comprise Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of
the Bosnian Serb parliament, Mr Mohammed Filipovic, a Moslem politician, and
Mr Miro Lasic, a Croat member of Bosnia's collective presidency.
The agreement coincided with UN confirmation that the last Serb militiamen
had withdrawn from strategic mountains seized over a week ago. The Serb
offensive had stalled the Geneva talks and raised the prospect of Nato air
strikes to destroy artillery threatening the capital.
Earlier yesterday Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, insisted
that ending the siege of Sarajevo had to be at the top of the agenda of the
latest talks. Further sessions of the talks are due today.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Remapping US telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph's planned Dollars 12.3bn acquisition of
McCaw Cellular Communications will not only be one of the largest takeovers
in US history. The deal may also herald a redrawing of the US
telecommunications map, which in its outlines still bears the marks of
AT&amp;T's enforced break-up in 1984.
The 1984 divestiture, overseen by Judge Harold Greene, split AT&amp;T into seven
local telecommunications groups, the Bell companies, and one long-distance
company, the continuing AT&amp;T. The Bell companies were prevented from
entering the long-distance market, while AT&amp;T was barred from operating
local networks.
Some lobbyists will no doubt argue that, in buying McCaw, AT&amp;T has found a
backdoor route into the local market, as cellular communications were not
included in the divestiture decree. They may even say the deal should be
blocked as the long-distance market is still a no-go area for the Bells.
Policymakers should give such arguments short shrift. At present, cellular
communications do not compete head-on with the Bell's local 'wireline' phone
services, as they are too expensive. Instead, cellular phones have expanded
the overall market by allowing people to make calls when they are on the
move. And, while cellular and other forms of radio communication will
undoubtedly provide stiff competition for wireline companies as costs fall,
the right response should be to sweep away restrictions on competition
rather than add new ones.
Justified fears
Judge Greene's imposition of no-go areas for the Bells probably had some
benefit back in 1984 in helping competition to take root. At the time, the
Bells controlled access to customers and there were justified fears that, if
allowed into the long-distance market, they would channel their customers'
traffic through their in-house networks and thus squeeze out rivals.
But the no-go areas now look like artificial lines on a map, as a result of
technological and commercial developments. Under a system known as equal
access, customers are able to choose the long-distance company through which
their calls should be routed, with the result that the Bells no longer
control customer access. Meanwhile, the Bells' local monopolies are being
eroded by the growth of alternative fibre-optic networks in large cities
such as New York. The monopolies would be under even greater threat if cable
television companies were generally allowed to provide telephone services
over their networks.
Extra costs
The divestiture restrictions have outlived their useful life. The
long-distance ban, in particular, has led to a balkanisation of the US
telecoms map, often requiring calls to be carried by roundabout routes
rather than in straight lines, so imposing extra costs. Competition has also
not been as vigorous as it could have been. It is unlikely AT&amp;T and MCI and
Spint, its two main long-distance rivals, would have announced price rises
last month if the Bells had been able to enter their markets.
A bonfire of artificial restrictions would not only do away with those
imposed at the time of divestiture. It would also abolish rules banning
local phone companies from providing cable television over their networks
and foreign companies from owning more than a minority share in any radio
licence. The cable TV ban could be deterring telecoms groups from laying
fibre-optic cables into people's homes, and hence the development of the
'information superhighways' that makes Vice-President Al Gore so
enthusiastic. Meanwhile, the restriction on foreign companies explains why
British Telecommunications was unable to acquire McCaw and is now selling
its minority stake to AT&amp;T. Such rules provide foreign governments with a
ready-made excuse to keep US telecoms companies out of their own markets.
Redrawing the US telecommunications map will not be an easy task, given the
vested interests in keeping competition out. But the US has already seen
benefits from competitive telecoms markets since AT&amp;T's break-up and should
have the courage to press on with further liberalisation.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Speculators as the scapegoats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUE TO past form, a number of European policymakers, notably in France and
Belgium, have reacted to the exchange rate mechanism debacle with loud calls
for measures to curb speculators, condemned as either errant or malicious.
These politicians reveal a worrying misunderstanding about markets. But they
are right in their belief that the European Community cannot return to where
it was a few weeks ago. What it must not do, however, is try to go further
backwards still, to the era of exchange controls.
Belgium's finance minister, Mr Philippe Maystadt, has condemned currency
speculation as 'a type of transaction which does not know any rules, no
costs and no taxes'. Earlier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, argued: 'The crisis wasn't due to concern about the franc itself,
but to a desire to destroy the European monetary system.' This, he added,
was because speculators want the world's currencies to float freely so they
can make more money.
These views would be funny if they were not so disturbing. Mr Balladur seems
unaware that even a shrewd speculator is unlikely to make a consistent
killing in a free market. The most profitable currency markets are ones in
which governments put themselves forward as pigeons for investors to pluck.
It would be surprising therefore if the latter were not praying for
immediate recreation of the narrow-band ERM. This the EC says it intends to
do. The question is whether its intention reflects the interests of the
people of Europe.
Unnecessary recession
Mr Balladur believes the security of his country has been endangered. But
perhaps what has been endangered is the reputation of its policymakers.
Those in office usually believe that their policies express the long-term
interests of their people, while speculative attacks reveal the
irresponsibility, if not wickedness, of markets. But that conclusion is not
self-evident.
In this case, speculators doubted the willingness of the French people to
tolerate an unnecessary recession in the name of European integration. By
doubting it, they created the conditions in which that policy could change,
a result that seems benign.
Whenever a perfectly good explanation can be found for the behaviour of
individual investors, conspiracy theories are unnecessary. Currency markets
are the largest and most liquid in the world. The envisaged collusion among
participants is inconceivable. To argue otherwise is to indulge in paranoia.
Freedom of movement
Exaggerating the wisdom of governments and the follies or even wickedness of
markets is, unfortunately, not the only mistake that has been made. As
important has been the undue identification of the cause of the European
integration with a particular monetary mechanism, a mistake that parallels
earlier worship of the common agricultural policy. The foundation for
European integration has, in fact, been the integration of the economies of
member states by the progressively increasing freedom of movement of goods,
services, labour and capital. The ERM, or even economic and monetary union,
can be justified largely to the extent that they support such integration.
This is why talk of exchange controls is self-defeating. In the absence of
some kind of global tax on foreign exchange transactions, which seems
infeasible in practice and questionable in theory, the only way to try to
prevent what happened to the ERM would be a return to tight national
exchange controls. But this would fragment the single market for capital and
severely hamper those in labour and services. Since the ERM has often been
justified as the monetary counterpart of the single market, it would be
perverse to adopt measures that would destroy what the mechanism is supposed
to preserve.
Apart from being perverse, exchange controls would probably also be
infeasible. The EC must move in a different direction. One alternative would
be faster movement towards monetary union. But this the Germans seem
unlikely to accept. Another would be to make the present wide bands work,
perhaps in the context of greater global exchange rate co-ordination. But
one thing is quite clear. There is no future for the EC in going backwards.
It must move forward instead.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Personal View: Opportunity knocks for the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAMESH PONNURU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government that has just taken power in Japan has a lot on its
collective mind - mainly, no doubt, how to hang on to it. It will be hard to
hold the coalition together, let alone to shake up the cosy world of Japan's
money politics and to give a fair deal to consumers. But that is what it was
elected to do.
The elections do not ensure that the relationship between government and
business will be transformed. Many of today's reformers, such as Tsutomu
Hata and Ichiro Ozawa, were yesterday's loyal Liberal Democratic party
Diet-men, which does not augur well for a clean break.
But if business as usual prevails, Japan will have missed a historic
opportunity. Systematic reform offers tangible benefits to Japanese
consumers. It would enable Japan's political system to respond to concerns
beyond those of entrenched interests. And America and Europe would also
profit.
Reform must be rooted in the recognition that political and economic
liberalisation go hand in hand. Regulation has increased the value for
businessmen of investing in politicians, and the cost of not doing so.
Japan's recent spending spree was designed partly to provide kickbacks from
public-works contracts.
Political reform requires a decline in the market value of politicians: the
rewards of economic activity must stay higher than those of political
activity. That in turn requires that politicians stop trying to manage the
economy. For clean politics, Japan must deregulate.
Japan's allies often cite its regulations as impediments to trade. Fair or
not, the complaints provide another reason to deregulate: reform could avert
the dangers of either a trade war or politically managed trade, both of
which would decrease the wealth of the entire world but would devastate an
island nation in particular.
Japan should therefore become the world's foremost free trader. Were
politicians in the US and Europe more responsible, Japan would not have to
assume this role. As it is, some economic power must act decisively if the
industrialised world is not to be split into three hostile trading blocs.
Dismantling corporatism would also improve Japan's economy. The
privatisation of its expensive national railway has halted massive losses.
Airline privatisations are forcing producers to serve consumers rather than
the reverse.
Deregulation of the retail distribution system would yield more benefits.
Zoning restrictions protect inefficient small shopkeepers. This policy also
irritates foreign businesses trying to distribute their products in Japan.
Eliminating trade and zoning protection for agriculture would further free
the market in land. Protecting agriculture diverts much land and labour to
unproductive uses. This policy, together with the high tax on the sale of
houses, exacerbates urban crowding. Kenichi Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese
arm of management consultant McKinsey, estimates that changing these
policies could quadruple the land available for development within 30 miles
of Tokyo. That in turn would shorten workers' average daily commuting time
of three hours. If politicians want to put the welfare of the people first,
agriculture protection must go.
Agricultural protection also raises land prices; and these high prices
impede foreign investment in Japan. The US Republican party's Wednesday
Group believes this factor contributes greatly to Japan's trade surplus with
America.
It is a pity so much attention has focused on this bilateral trade balance.
The pursuit of a 'solution' to the imbalance leads to counterproductive
ideas, such as artificially reducing Japan's savings rate. Removing barriers
to investment in Japan, however, would be good in itself, and could shrink
the imbalance as a happy side-effect.
Japan should resist putting bureaucrats back in charge to 'manage' trade to
meet foreign demands. The bureaux will be tempted, as this would give them a
new lease of life. So will some companies: export restraints have
transferred wealth from foreign consumers to Japanese exporters. But
cart-elisation cannot benefit the public.
During the election campaign, Japan's reformers stuck to generalities, such
as ending corruption. But they also called for less government, denouncing
the high prices and inefficiency resulting from intervention. They must now
make good that promise.
They should do it because deregulation will destroy the structural base of
much political corruption; liberalisation will please Japan's allies; and,
most important, the Japanese public deserves a better deal.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Last post for the big books: The mail order business needs
to adapt and innovate to survive in a competitive climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Great Universal Stores last month to end six decades of
family control by enfranchising its non-voting shares could open a new
chapter for the company. It could do the same for the UK business it still
dominates: mail order.
The move by the mail order, retailing and financial services group aroused
speculation in the City that it might shed its conservative image and use
its Pounds 1.3bn cash reserves to become the adventurous and acquisitive
company it was in the 1950s and 1960s. Some observers hoped it would invest
in technology and lead the UK mail order business in adopting systems for
communicating with customers via cable television, and eventually
interactive video transmissions.
Change may be needed because the outlook for traditional mail order in
Europe and the US is uncertain. The arrival of new technology and growing
competition from sophisticated high-street retailers are forcing mail order
operators to look at innovative ways of selling, and improve their service
to customers to hold on to market share.
A report last week by Verdict, the retail research group, says growth in the
UK mail order market outpaced the rest of the retail sector last year. But
in each of the six previous years, mail order's share of the retail market
had shrunk.
Only weeks before GUS's announcement, Sears Roebuck of the US finally closed
its catalogue division, ending an American tradition and raising questions
about the future of the industry in the US.
For much of the 20th century Sears's Big Book was a symbol of 'middle
America'. But though the catalogue still circulated to 14m households last
year, sales of Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 2.2bn) were not enough to avoid a
Dollars 175m division loss. The Big Book could no longer hold its own
against younger, more carefully-targeted competitors in a market approaching
saturation, and being invaded by cable TV operators.
The Sears general merchandise catalogue had become a mainstay for isolated
farming communities in the midwestern US and, it was said, the most popular
home literature in America next to the Bible. But during the 1980s the Big
Book faced a growing number of rivals, as higher transport costs and road
congestion boosted home shopping. Delivery systems were improved, and niche
marketing developed. US sales from home shopping rose by 48.8 per cent in
1987-90, to Dollars 31.6bn.
The fortunes of mail order in the UK followed a similar path, after it
originated in the late 19th century in so-called 'turn' or credit clubs,
whose members paid a shilling a week and were able to buy Pounds 1 worth of
goods every 20 weeks.
After the first world war, clubs developed networks of agents, with an
average of 20 or more customers each. They found a ready market,
particularly among poorer socio-economic classes in northern England, who
were prepared to accept relatively slow delivery times in exchange for low
prices and - long before they were offered by the rest of the retail sector
 -credit facilities.
But, as in the US, the glossy catalogues no longer hold the allure they once
did. Traditional advantages - availability of credit, convenience, home
delivery and low prices - are constantly being eroded by developments in
high-street retailing. Between 1985 and 1991, home shopping's share of
retail sales fell from 3.54 per cent to 2.96 per cent, although it improved
again last year to 3.16 per cent.
In continental Europe, the picture is mixed. In France and Germany the mail
order business is well-established. The French market has grown steadily to
reach FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in 1992, according to Euromonitor, the UK
market research group. Germany has by far the strongest mail order market in
Europe, growing to DM47.3bn (Pounds 18.4bn) last year.
But in Italy, a less developed market, mail order grew by about 30 per cent
between 1987 and 1992, to L1,845bn (Pounds 770m). Over the same period,
Spain's equivalent sales almost tripled from an underdeveloped base to reach
Pta80bn (Pounds 385.5m).
In developed markets, home shopping accounts for between 3 and 6 per cent of
all retail sales. Some experts regard the latter figure as the ceiling and
forecast declines in the next few years. 'The long-term trend is definitely
down,' says Richard Hyman, director of Verdict.
Others in the retailing industry think mail order can hold or increase
market share, but only by taking advantage of new technology. 'Big book'
operators are expected to move increasingly towards using television to sell
their products. The merger proposed last month between the two largest
teleshopping operators in the US, Home Shopping Network and QVC, to form a
Dollars 2.2bn network, shows the developing strength of the medium.
Catalogue shopping is unlikely to die out, but is expected to focus
increasingly on niche markets. 'The shape of mail order in the '90s will be
direct, targeted catalogues rather than the big books,' says Jim Martin,
chief executive of N Brown, the UK mail order operator. N Brown publishes 11
catalogues, aimed mainly at women over 50 and those requiring non-standard
sizes.
The company provides a lesson in the power and sophistication of targeted
catalogues. It has profitably expanded its market to include women in their
40s and younger, but many products in its two catalogues aimed at this age
group are no different from those in the books for the 50-plus market. The
catalogues are presented differently, excluding some products and
rephotographing others on younger models.
US mail order companies are leading the way in this development. Spiegel,
which became the second-largest US mail order company with the withdrawal of
Sears, publishes 30 different catalogues.
Catalogues are also starting to target upmarket customers. In the UK, the
Next directory, the mail order operation of the high-street fashion chain,
has introduced a younger generation, with different lifestyles and higher
incomes than their parents at the same age, to home shopping. Such
catalogues are aimed at time-conscious more than price-conscious consumers,
and foster a specific style or fashion image. Several focus on men, who have
previously been less inclined to buy mail order than women.
But even for companies which do not move to selling by television,
technology will be important in making ordering easier and improving
delivery times. The nature of home shopping means it can be automated to a
high degree.
At Home Shopping Network in the US, half of all incoming calls are handled
by Tootie, a voice response network. Orders and credit inquiries are handled
by a computer and all information transmitted to a database which sends out
birthday cards to customers, and reminders to reorder products they buy
regularly.
Richard Pugh, deputy chairman of GUS, refused to be drawn last month about
whether GUS would move towards teleshopping. But he did outline his vision
of automated warehouses, where goods arrive, are stored, picked and
dispatched to customers without being touched by human hand.
Meanwhile, the reshaping of the mail order market is likely to accelerate.
Mail order operators gain even more than most retailers from economies of
scale, and larger companies are expected to continue to swallow up smaller
ones. Two of the UK's best-known catalogue retailers, Grattan and Empire,
have been purchased by continental European operators - Germany's Otto
Versand and France's La Redoute - in the past two years. There are
suggestions in the City that if GUS decides to expand across Europe it may,
in turn, bid for La Redoute.
Less developed markets provide opportunities for growth. Mail order could be
particularly important in east Europe, where the retailing and distribution
infrastructure is poor, and it provides a relatively low-cost way of
entering the market.
The emergence of GUS from decades of close control by the Wolfson family may
prove timely. As new technology such as cable television and interactive
communications spreads, and agency systems are replaced by direct marketing,
the mail order business may change more in the next decade than it has in
the 61 years since Isaac Wolfson first took command.

What is the most vital item British tourists always take on holiday? A

Who would dare cross the threshold of Maggie's Den or brace themselves for a
stiff one with The Iron Lady?
Much of British history is celebrated in pub signs; the Saracen's Head
recalls the Crusades, John of Gaunt is remembered as the Red Lion, and
Richard III as the White Boar.
So the Brewers' Society decided to ask the publicans of today for their
opinion of contemporary history. What facets of modern life did they think
likely to be commemorated on the pub signs of tomorrow? Not surprisingly, of
all the people and events that have made their marks on the 1900s, the two
nominated for similar immortality are Margaret Thatcher and the computer.
The Thatcher, in her usual fashion, dominated the political entries. Only
two others merited suggestions - Norman Lamont (Lamont's Lament) and David
Mellor (The Mellor Drama).
But The Silicon Chip, The Bit and Byte, The Computer and Mouse, et al,
according to the licensees, was likely to be honoured long after that other
phenomenon of our times, the Euro-Sceptic, was forgotten.

Remember Bill Hussey, the mining man who was sent to look for gold in
Kazakhstan and found his new mine was only a few mushroom clouds away from
the former Soviet Union's nuclear test sites? Observer was reassured to hear
that he has taken to carrying a geiger-counter. However, there was some
consternation recently when Hussey pointed his gadget towards the Broadgate
complex; it registered three times the level of radioactivity found in
Kazakhstan.

Hard to believe that with the stock market flirting with its all-time high
there are still some investment analysts who can't afford their subs.
However, the Institute of Investment Management and Research, which
represents Britain's 3,100 investment analysts, likes to think of itself as
a caring organisation. Hence, it has asked members not currently employed to
send a letter 'explaining their circumstances', and it will consider
deferring payment of its Pounds 81 a year subscription fee. The society
insists that this generous gesture is in no way related to the fact that it
has just raised membership fees by 8 per cent.

When the British government seems intent on privatising anything that moves,
why has it farmed out all the wounded casualties from Sarajevo to public
sector hospitals?
Given the pressure on resources in the National Health Service and the
shortage of beds, it would make sense for the authorities to tap the offers
of beds in private hospitals. If the private hospitals are prepared to treat
the wounded for free, whereas the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab for
the use of NHS hospitals, there would be a net saving to the public purse.
If the reason is that the authorities feel more comfortable using NHS
hospitals that they know, why did the Overseas Development Agency turn down
the offer of an RAF VC-10 aeroplane and hire a Russian Tu-154 air ambulance?
To date, the only party which comes out well from the affair is the Saudi
Arabian royal family, who helped pay for the evacuations.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Observer: New York Fed form guide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Bill McDonough has settled in as the new president of the New York
Fed, all eyes are on who gets the number two spot he vacated. Given that the
person picked will be one of the leading players in the world's foreign
exchange markets, the pressure is on for an early decision.
McDonough, who had done 22 years at First Chicago, had only been in the job
for 18 months, so it is no surprise that two veteran insiders are the firm
favourites to become the next open market account manager with the
responsibility for carrying out the Fed's monetary policy directives.
What is different this time, however, is that the two favourites are women:
Joan Lovett, manager of the domestic open market desk, and Gretchen Greene,
manager of the foreign open market desk. When the presidency was up for
grabs earlier this year there was considerable speculation that the Fed
might choose a woman. So the chances of a woman in the number two slot are
now higher.
Of the two likely candidates, Lovett might have an edge because her role as
chief of domestic market operations is arguably more important than
Greene's, who handles the Fed's activities in the currency markets. Greene,
however, has a clear advantage in seniority and experience - she has run the
foreign desk for more than 20 years, and was in the running for the job when
McDonough was brought in from outside.
She also happens to be married to Ed Yeo, a former under secretary of the US
Treasury in the Ford administration. Yeo went on to do a stint as First
Chicago's chief financial officer but quit after a boardroom row in 1980. He
was replaced by McDonough. Whether this helps or hinders his wife's chances
of promotion remains to be seen.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Options rise can stabilise copper
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Kenneth Gooding's article 'Copper market responds to 'rogue' element'
(August 13) gives the impression that the massive increase in option
activity in the copper market over the past few years has been disruptive
and destabilising. However, I believe the opposite to be the case.
Primary copper producers and others are developing a keen appetite for
options. The granters and users of options are the new managers of risk and
the principal providers of liquidity, and even of greater stability in the
marketplace. They will help avert - or at least mitigate - critical times in
the future.
Gooding correctly paraphrases my remarks in Metals and Minerals Annual
Review on the subject of London Metal Exchange warehouses in other key
industrial areas. But I was deliberately non-specific about suitable new
locations.
I believe that LME warehouses in the US for copper (the LME has them for all
other base metals) would seriously threaten the continued viability of the
Comex copper market, which is the only base metal futures contract in the
US.
The arbitrage between the LME and the Comex copper contracts would be
undermined and destroyed. Valuable liquidity would be lost to the LME and
might not be adequately replaced, at least in the near term, by other
business from the US.
Finally, your leading article 'A scrap over aluminium' (August 13) addresses
the European Community restrictions on aluminium imports from the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
The European aluminium producers who pressed for those restrictions clearly
had their heads firmly in the sand while, Canute-like, they commanded the
waters to recede.
This attempt to gain EC protection demonstrates a lamentable lack of
comprehension of how the market works. The aluminium market is international
and the price will not be affected by the EC restrictions on imports of CIS
material.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public smoking epidemic keeps US
visitors away from Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr M SINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the decline of US visitor numbers ('Cheap money is no
bargain', August 7/8) misses an important reason for the current reluctance
of Americans to visit Europe.
On October 14 1777, Mozart wrote from Augsburg in Germany about his visit to
a coffee-house. 'When I entered I thought that I should drop down, overcome
by the stink and fumes of tobacco. But with God's help I had to stand it for
an hour; and I pretended to enjoy it all, though to me it seemed as if we
were in Turkey.'
An epidemic of public smoking has spread through mainland Europe. From
railway station waiting rooms to restaurants, from theatre foyers to taxis,
from hotels to hospitals, the visitor is condemned to the situation endured
by Mozart. The UK is better, but not by much. How charming the intimate
little restaurants are - if you do not mind a sore throat, streaming eyes,
and all your clothes needing cleaning.
Complaints are met by amused shrugs at the fussiness of Americans. The
trouble for the European tourist industry is that those fussy people go back
home and pass on the word to all their fussy friends.
Most Americans do not smoke, and do not like smoke. The Americans with most
money to spend are those who dislike smoke the most. European restaurateurs,
publicans, and others who earn much of their living from the tourist trade,
may not be aware of the full cost of that smoking habit.
Mozart stayed two more weeks in Augsburg, but he did not return to the
coffee-house - nor to Augsburg.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: The heavy burdens of competition law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From S L SIDKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The need for competition law reform is undeniable as the points in
'Competition on the back burner' (August 10) make clear.
However, there are two further points that should be added.
First, the Court of Appeal has added to the burden of the Office of Fair
Trading. As a result of a decision in 1991 it is now incumbent on the OFT to
establish not only that individual employees have participated in a
registrable agreement - which can be difficult - but also that in
participating in such an agreement they were acting within the scope of
their authority. This is even more difficult to show.
Second, the opportunity exists for someone who is affected by the unlawful
operation of a registerable agreement to sue for damages any party which
gives effect to it.
One example of this occurred some years ago when four companies paid to the
Post Office approximately Pounds 9m in an out-of-court settlement. The money
was paid by way of an adjustment to prices charged under a registerable, but
unregistered, agreement.
However, this remedy is rarely used by the victims of market-sharing and
price-fixing cartels.
Perhaps if more businesses made use of this remedy the government might
consider it desirable to accelerate the introduction of legislation reforms.
For the present the government is being mealy-mouthed. It retains
competition legislation that is not up to the job and which imposes
unnecessary burdens on many small- and medium-sized companies. But at the
same time it heralds its devotion to competition and to freeing businesses
from the burden of red tape.
Without government action, competition will be more in the refrigerator than
on the back burner.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Painful adjustments: The chancellor's dilemma - an inside
view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why have we, as a nation, chosen to borrow so much? Why are we living beyond
our means by about 3 per cent of our national in-come? There is a simple
explanation.
In the 1980s our spending habits were based on a national income boosted by
oil revenues. In 1986 the value of the oil rents halved when the oil price
fell. Revenue has subsequently fallen further as oil output has declined. We
have failed to adjust our spending to that loss of income. Our balance of
payments went into deficit in the late 1980s and has been in deficit ever
since.
The economic adjustments required by the arrival and departure of North Sea
oil are complex. When the oil revenues first arrived the resulting balance
of payments surplus, and optimism about its future, drove up the exchange
rate. Manufacturing industry shrank in consequence, and we had a national
debate about the perils of industrial decline.
What will happen, people asked, when the oil runs out, and we haven't enough
capacity to export manufactures instead? The answer, obvious to many
economists but received with scepticism by businessmen, is that if a high
exchange rate can cause manufacturing industry to shrink, a low one can
cause it to expand. As the oil revenues dwindle, the exchange rate will
fall, and manufacturing industry will expand again.
Until 1986, when Britain had a large and growing unearned income from its
oil rents, we all enjoyed extra spending power which came to us in two ways:
the government's oil revenues allowed it to hold taxes lower than would
otherwise have been the case, while the high exchange rate made imports
cheaper. So we could afford to import goods previously made here and use the
domestic resources thus freed to improve living standards by providing more
services.
That is what has happened in every country or region that has benefited from
a mineral discovery. It was not a coincidence that thousands of new
restaurants opened in the UK in the 1980s while local industries went to the
wall. The same has happened after every gold rush in history.
But when the mineral boom is over and the rents start to dwindle, the supply
side of the economy needs to readjust. More goods and services have to be
produced for sale abroad. The only way of achieving that is via a fall in
the exchange rate, which shifts resources previously producing goods for
domestic consumption into the export sector. In the UK case, as we shall
see, that probably means shifting resources out of the service sector and
back into manufacturing ind-ustry.
In other words, the loss of the oil revenues means a reduction in our
standard of living. And that comes about in two ways: a lower exchange rate
makes imports more expensive, and higher taxes reduce disposable incomes.
I have no doubt that economic historians will see the fall in the exchange
rate last September after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism
and the subsequent increases in taxes as part of an inevitable adjustment
process to the loss of the North Sea revenues. The only puzzle in this neat
story is why we had to wait until 1992-93 before adjusting to a fall in the
oil price which took place as long ago as 1986.
In fact the exchange rate did fall in 1986. But the fall was quickly
reversed by the boom of the late 1980s which generated worldwide interest in
what was briefly dubbed the British miracle. Mrs Margaret Thatcher (as she
then was) won a third term of office, taxes were cut, growth accelerated,
and international companies stampeded to invest in the UK. The inflow of
capital drove up the exchange rate and stopped in its tracks the adjustment
to lower oil prices that was just starting.
It also made any adjustment unnecessary - for a while. Lower oil revenues
meant that, sooner or later, the UK consumer would have to retrench. But the
evil day could be put off as long as foreigners were willing to lend. So in
the late 1980s, far from cutting back in response to the fall in the oil
price, we embarked on a spending spree. Much of that extra spending was on
imports, not paid for by oil revenues but by borrowing. It didn't matter,
because UK plc was flavour of the month, and ev-eryone wanted to lend to us.
The boom of the late 1980s was a service sector boom. Business investment
increased sharply, but casual observation suggests that much of that
investment took the form of new office blocks, shopping malls and DIY
superstores. The statistics confirm the evidence of our eyes: 95 per cent of
the increase in investment between 1985 and 1991 was in the service sector,
and nearly half went into the City.
The extra investment improved living standards - but did it enhance
Britain's ability to earn its way in the world? In theory there is no reason
why we should not do that by exporting services. An improvement in Britain's
balance of trade does not have to come from manufacturing. In practice
however, despite the massive investment of the late 1980s in services, the
export of services actually fell slightly as a share of gross domestic
product.
I conclude that the adjustment to a world of lower oil revenues will require
a shift of resources out of services and into manufacturing. That adjustment
has already begun, because the recession has been worst in the south, where
services predominate, while the manufacturing north has escaped relatively
lightly. The priority now is to ensure that the resources freed up by
recession are absorbed again by manufacturing (or other industries whose
output can be sold abroad and/or replace imports). They must not be
pre-empted, as happened in the late 1980s, by another domestic service
sector boom.
It was Winston Churchill, as chancellor, who said (of the return to gold in
1925): 'I would rather see finance less proud and industry more content.'
The fall in the exchange rate last September (analogous in many ways to
coming off gold in 1931) achieves exactly that. It is the key to the
expansion of manufacturing, which is why we have seen a rise in output this
year despite flat retail sales.
One aim of monetary policy must now be to ensure that the competitive
advantage delivered by Black Wednesday remains intact. If that means lower
interest rates, then an increase in taxes (or cut in public spending) will
be all the more necessary to curb the resulting growth in domestic demand.
Low interest rates and higher taxes: that is how to ease our economic
adjustment to dwindling oil revenues.

special adviser to the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont

FT  17 AUG 93 / Powers of an invisible man: Peter Schmidhuber, EC budget
commissioner, talks to Lionel Barber about the cash crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout his five-and-a-half years as European Community budget
commissioner, Mr Peter Schmidhuber has been virtually invisible to the
public eye.
A master of the long and winding subordinate clause, his ponderous manner
and penchant for grey suits fit the popular image of the German public
servant dedicated to fulfilling the most thankless tasks, in his case
super-vision of the annual Ecu68bn budget.
Yet there is another side to Mr Schmidhuber, which belies his reputation as
one of the least inspiring members of the European Commission. A native
Bavarian, he has a stubborn streak which bursts into occasional declarations
of independence.
He boycotted the emergency session called by Commission president Mr Jacques
Delors 12 days ago to discuss the exchange rate mechanism debacle. He let it
be known the meeting was more a talking shop than a decision-taking forum,
and remained in his vacation home in the Austrian Alps.
Mr Schmidhuber's independent character also means that he is receptive to
ideas which might be shunned by some commissioners. For instance, he has
long been an advocate of Austria's entry into the Community, arguing that
membership would strengthen its ties with south-eastern Europe, including
the Balkans. He has also suggested that the 17 commissioners should be
elected directly by the European Parliament, a step which would diminish
national patronage but would make the Commission more accountable.
What is most striking about Mr Schmidhuber's EC career is how he has
exploited his low profile to accumulate power in the Brussels bureaucracy.
Mr Schmidhuber plays several important roles. His main job is chief
financial controller, monitoring how and where the Community budget is
spent. But he is also in charge of the Community's fight against fraud. And
last year he took over responsibility for the Cohesion Fund, which will hand
over more than Ecu15bn to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain over the next
seven years to enable these poorer EC member states to meet Community
environmental standards and improve their transport and communications
infrastructure.
His immediate task is to tackle the latest EC financial crisis, triggered by
lower-than-expected growth and the recent debacle in Europe's currency
markets, which has led to a devaluation of the Ecu - the currency in which
most of the Community's budget is denominated.
Spending constraints have forced the Commission to freeze 965 posts and
rigorously enforce expenditure limits. Staff have started complaining that
broken-down equipment such as photocopiers are not being replaced, while
core activities such as trade missions are suffering because of travel cuts.
The squeeze is set to continue next year because of a surge of almost 20 per
cent in pension costs. The reason: young Eurocrats who entered the European
Economic Community in 1958 after the Treaty of Rome are now approaching the
retirement limit of 60.
'We are already feeling the pinch,' said Mr Schmidhuber in an interview
before the effective collapse of the ERM, 'but there is a saying in Germany:
'He who bears the cross will attain salvation'.'
Mr Schmidhuber's designated cross is the European Parliament. MEPs are
pressing for more influence over the budget, partly in anticipation of new
powers on 'co-decision' which the parliament will gain once the Maastricht
treaty is ratified by all 12 member states. But the present impasse also
points to unfinished budget business at last December's summit in Edinburgh.
Although EC leaders agreed to a seven-year budget deal which raised spending
from 1.2 per cent of Community gross domestic product to 1.27 per cent by
1999, parliament is withholding approval. MEPs are sticking to two demands:
an increase in influence in shaping non-discretionary spending, such as the
Ecu35bn farm budget; and a 'revision clause' allowing for a fresh look at
spending levels on January 1 1995.
This is the somewhat ambitious date set for the entry of Austria, Finland,
Sweden and Norway into the EC. Mr Schmidhuber points out that it would be a
natural point at which to re-examine the Edinburgh budget assumptions. If
the Nordic newcomers turn into net contributors, this could create fresh
resources for those areas, such as EC foreign policy and research spending,
which were short-changed, he says.
The call for more money falls into familiar categories. First, the Community
budget, at only 2.4 per cent of the total public expenditure of member
states, is small; second, the EC continues to take on new tasks, such as aid
to eastern Europe; third, the Common Agricultural Policy, though nearly 50
per cent of the total budget, is declining and remains modest.
Critics counter that the Community continues to suffer from a cultural bias
in favour of spending. This stems from its traditional role of launching
policies in partnership with member states, without a corresponding
mechanism for measuring their success.
This is particularly true of the Structural Fund, the development aid
programme which with a budget of Ecu141.5bn between 1994-99 is designed to
help the EC's poorer regions; but it also explains why billions of Ecus have
been wasted in the agricultural budget in various milk, olive oil and
tobacco scandals, mainly in the Mediterranean countries.
Mr Schmidhuber says studies on Structural Fund spending are carried out
every three years, but he concedes that clear answers are elusive. 'If you
run a bicycle shop, you can tell after a year whether it was a good idea or
not. You can tell if you made a profit or a loss. But it is not that easy
with public investment.'
Yet the Maastricht treaty's emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - devolving
responsibility from Brussels to national and local level - must surely force
the Commission to develop new types of management skills and better
information flows to establish whether EC policies are working.
Mr Schmidhuber suggests that the increasing use of external consultants
shows the Commission is moving in the right direction. But even the low-key
commissioner admits that much more needs to be done.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Credit terms too favourable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID REX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Readers may have been surprised by the revelations on discounting
contained in the Winkler marketing survey ('Watch those freebies', 10
August). But those findings are likely to represent only part of the
picture.
In the work that my organisation does with companies on their trade
receivables I have been surprised by the extent to which extended credit
terms have been granted - often, as with discounting, in the belief that
such terms are a precondition of remaining competitive.
I refer not to the late payment of debt but to the formal sanctioning of
credit periods of double or more the supplier's preferred terms. Such terms
can be especially attractive within the organisation as, unlike most forms
of direct discounting, the impact is often not measured as a cost of sale
and is therefore more readily perceived as a no-cost option by those who
grant it.
Looking at these activities in the context of your editorial of the same day
('Profits please') perhaps managements and leader writers should remember
that it is not government or wage bargainers who are the prime determinators
of profits and margins.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: The Brecon jazz festival jumps with talent into the
early hours - Garry Booth enjoys the Golden Men and much more in the Welsh
hills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The glorious contrasts and incongruities of the Brecon Jazz Festival set it
apart from the more urbane, metropolitan happenings of summer. Trad mayhem,
swing and bebop permeate the comfortably fraying fabric of the Welsh market
town, running together happily. While a samba army rattles the sash windows
of The Bulwark, a street-corner barber's-shop quartet holds its own against
the spiky young fusionists in the museum car park bandstand. In the main
square, two apprehensive Chet Baker soundalikes are scattered from their
busking pitch by a weighty New Orleans marching band advancing noisily from
the top of the town.
Hastily regrouping before their audience is carried along in the band's
wake, they turn to find a second, bigger band bearing down on them, at full
steam, from the other end of town.
This year's contrasts were carried into the concert hall programming: at
midnight on Friday, pianist Hank Jones' Trio could be found dispensing sweet
standards in the tranquil setting of Christ College's school hall, while
Julian Joseph and his quartet drowned out the late-night boozers in the
Guildhall with their energetic British neo-bop. Earlier, in the cavernous
market hall, which smelled less of sheep this 10th anniversary year, Lionel
Hampton swung his Golden Men of Jazz with the kind of vim you would not
reasonably expect of any 85-year-old other than Hamp (except maybe Stephane
Grappelli, who climbed on to the same stand on Sunday).
Helped in his directing by trombonist Al Grey, splendid in pith helmet and
wing collar, Golden Men, such as trumpeters Harry 'Sweets' Edison and a
languid Clark Terry were pushed along by the vamping piano of Junior Mance,
Arvell Shaw on bass fiddle, and the singing drummer, Grady Tate.
If Hamp looks frail negotiating the stairs to the stand, he is rejuvenated
when reunited with the vibes. More than that, he is difficult to dislodge
once the swinging starts. 'We'll be back,' he said as Grey tried to prise
his sticks from him for the interval, 'we gonna feed the sheep.'
As Hampton was reluctantly leaving the stand, a sprint across town was
needed to catch Hank Jones meshing neatly with drummer Idris Muhammad and
bassist Heyn van der Geyn. Romantic but fleet pianist, moving from Weill to
Kern via Joe Henderson, the equilateral sound of the trio is both tight and
soothing.
McCoy Tyner, in a rare solo performance, later filled the same space with
torrential originals and supercharged standards. Gathering up fistfuls of
notes with the right and throwing down clumps of chords with the left, Tyner
burns with ideas: even when the musical firework is not exploding, the
shapes and hues in each hiatus are hypnotic.
Trumpet players at either end of the gravitas spectrum were well
represented. Australian multi-instrumentalist, James Morrison, comes over
like a ribald Muppet but plays the horn like Gabriel. His self-deprecating
wit - 'we don't do requests . . . unless we're asked' - and unstinting
mickey-taking of brother John, the drummer, belie an indecent mastery of
trumpet, flugel, trombone and euphonium. 'Things Aint What They Used To Be'
featured Morrison duetting by himself, trombone multiphonics in one hand and
searing trumpet in the other. If it were not for the brother mugging
furiously behind, it could almost be too much of a good thing.
Trumpet virtuoso, Wynton Marsalis, is sometimes criticised for being too
good at too much. The control and purity of tone required for the concerto
have no place in jazz, say the unconverted. Jazz favours a flawed beauty,
according to conventional wisdom, and although Marsalis is steeped in the
New Orleans tradition, he has insufficient demons to progress the genre,
they say. But with these six young men around him, he convinces me: wailing
through a marching blues, alongside the caustic clarinet of Walter Blanding,
swaying in a funereal dirge with Wycliffe 'Pine Cone' Gordon on
plunger-muted trombone, or zipping through a bebop piece with the full
ensemble in tight harmony, he is hard to fault in any department.
The superstars do not steal the show entirely at Brecon, however. And the
pubs, hotels and temporary stands around town jump with talent until the
early hours. Flying ants, intrusive BBC crews and the ubiquitous pavement
pizza aside, Brecon remains nigh-on jazz heaven.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Takemitsu and Maxwell Davies - Promenade concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The title, From me flows what you call Time, was the most cumbersome thing
about the Toru Takemitsu work performed at the Albert Hall (British
premiere) on Saturday. In other respects, any more picturesque offering from
this year's BBC Proms schedule is hardly imaginable.
Written for the Canadian five-man percussion ensemble Nexus to play with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra during the 1990 celebrations of the New York
Carnegie Hall's centenary, the piece developed its musical rationale (and
title) out of the Japanese composer's vision of '100 years of time flowing
through the man-made space, so full of special meaning, called Carnegie
Hall'. The result is an 'architectural' composition - designed (as were,
say, Berlioz's Grande Messe des morts or Messiaen's Couleurs de la cite
celeste) to fill out a large space in a manner combining spectacle, ritual,
and a vibrant awakening of the space in question.
The Albert Hall is always an ideal space for such awakenings; and certainly,
it afforded ample room for Takemitsu's 30-minute rainbow of sonorous
effects. The five Nexus players, each one an extraordinary virtuoso, entered
one by one with bells in hand to join the already-playing orchestra (BBC
Symphony under Andrew Davis); their five widely-separated banks of exotic
percussion instruments formed part of the visual fascination (the front two
each connected by long coloured streamers to a set of wind-chimes hanging
'stereophonically' from left- and right-hand balconies).
In a sense, the music is no more than a five-person percussion concerto,
simply shaped in its connected movements, with diverse exquisite
combinations of soloists (some improvised upon a basis of 'free' notation)
set against a light, airy orchestral background (surprisingly sweet-toothed
and succulent at times). In another and perhaps more important sense, it
seems to be a tapestry of responses to the natural world, evoked in
contemplative mood and designed with masterly and entirely unobvious skill
to achieve the same in its listeners.
In a clever feat of Proms planning, Saturday's programme (which also
included Mozart and Tippett) balanced the Takemitsu with another musical act
of nature contemplation, albeit of a very different - western late-Romantic
 -kind. Janice Watson, a young lyric soprano of boundless potential, sang
the closing scene from Strauss's opera Daphne in tones remarkably unforced
and steady, not sumptuous but always cleanly floated. Her final wordless
arabesques - Strauss's lambent evocation of a woman turned into a laurel
tree - were pure delight.
                         *      *      *
The Prom on Friday brought the return of a major British work from the
1980s. The Second Symphony of Peter Maxwell Davies was heard at the Proms
shortly after its Boston premiere in 1981 and memories of it as a
large-scale symphony that was easy to approach were largely borne out.
Not that one would have thought so from the audience response. At the end of
the first movement a large number of people (more than 100) left their seats
and headed for the exit door; after each of the second and third movements
the ritual was repeated, as a mass departure gathered momentum. Davies was
conducting the performance and from the podium he watched the audience
disperse with a wry smile and no small measure of patience.
The irony is that the Davies we hear in this symphony (unlike the younger
composer with his fondness for parody and violence) is consciously trying to
beguile the senses. References to Debussy's La Mer in the programme were
well chosen. The wavelets of wind scales trickling away at the end of the
first movement, the glitter of percussion, the aqueous clarity of the
orchestral textures - everything has an impressionist feel to it.
According to the composer's own description, the symphony was inspired by
the sounds and behaviour of the sea. Various wave-types are detailed as
being especially formative, although I doubt that a listener could pick out
much of that without being told in advance. What one hears is rather less
than a symphony, more the ebb and flow of imaginative washes of sound. There
is little strong thematic material in the foreground, but the general
ambience is very expressive.
It seems best to take it on trust that the BBC Philharmonic's performance
went according to the composer's wishes. The attractive features of the
symphony, not to mention its scale, suggest that this is a Davies work that
should still be in circulation a further decade hence, by which time one
hopes the audience will be prepared to hear it through.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Saints and sinners / Review of the Holbeins at the
Scottish National Gallery - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The visual arts have always lived on the margin of the Edinburgh Festival.
There have been memorable exhibitions at festival time over the years, but
successive directors have seldom put much effort, let alone money, into
their preparation and promotion, taking the view that any curator worth his
salt would fill his gallery with something special to tempt the visitor.
This year, however, all that has changed. The Festival's new director, Mr
Brian McMaster, would clearly have none of it and, for the first time has
banished the Scottish National Galleries and Museums, and pretty well
everyone else for that matter, to the outer darkness so far as the Festival
is concerned, where I hear there has been much wailing and gnashing of
teeth. A solitary serious exhibition makes it into the official festival
brochure - 'The Waking Dream' at the City Art Gallery, a splendid show, it
must be said, of a prime selection of historic photographs in the Gilman
Paper Company's collection, brought over by the Metropolitan Museum of New
York. But this one exception, however splendid, serves only to make the
broader omission the more perverse.
Together the galleries in Edinburgh this year hold as strong a hand as for
any recent festival. It is all very well for the new director to turn his
back on all things visual, but the Festival's literature goes round the
world, and who is to know how many potential punters might just have been
persuaded to make the trip by the knowledge that the Queen's Holbeins (at
the Scottish National Gallery), two centuries' worth of Scottish drawings
and watercolours (at the Royal Scottish Academy), and an important show (at
the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art) of early Russian avant-garde
painting from Russian museums, and so much else besides, was there in
Edinburgh to be enjoyed as well. Whether or not Mr McMaster has cloth ears I
leave to my music-critic colleagues to judge, but that he should so
arbitrarily visit upon his public the consequences of his having cloth eyes
I do feel is hardly clever.
The Holbein exhibition alone is a major event, major enough to be the
centre-piece of the entire Festival. It is very small, nothing more than 29
drawings and five miniature paintings that barely fill the smallest of the
Gallery's showing spaces, but what it lacks in size is more than made up in
its visual impact. There are some 80 drawings in the royal collection, of
which these are the principal and most famous examples and, in their strange
and peculiar way, they are truly shocking things.
Their capacity to shock is nothing to do with content or subject-matter.
Here are simply Tudor lords, ladies or gentlemen as may be, registered in a
consistent half-length format that celebrates directly neither their
opulence nor power, though all are evidently comfortable. Rather they are
presented with a most disarming and intimate naturalism, at it is precisely
this quality of naturalism that makes them so shocking. It is a shock of
recognition still potent across the centuries, a frisson of shared
experience and common humanity. There these people are, young or old,
beautiful or ugly, as fresh on the page as the day Holbein sat down to draw
them, his friends and acquaintances, in such conversational ease. And with
this naturalism, too, we catch perhaps that first shift of sensibility,
which marks the cusp between the medieval and the modern. Perhaps it is that
which is so shocking.
Holbein made two extended visits to England, the first in 1526 as a young
artist in his late twenties, when he came from his home at Basle to work
very much under the wing of the King's new Lord Chancellor, in which office
he had succeeded the disgraced Cardinal Wolsey, Sir Thomas More and his
family. He went home again in 1528, returning to London in 1532 when he
began to work rather more in the orbit of the Court itself. This second
visit, behind which we sense rather more the looming presence of the King,
saw not only the death of More, but the rise and fall of many if his new
sitters, these heads, ambitious and wistful by turns, that we know all too
well were so soon to roll. And it is by no means fanciful to detect, between
the two groups into which the drawings naturally fall, a marked if subtle
difference of mood and feeling. It is not so much that the intimacy is any
the less, but is there is even so an emotional distance in the late works
that was not there before. At ease he might be with the young Earl of Surrey
or Sir Thomas Wyatt, and even friends, but yet the engagement is something
more of a professional objectivity. With More and his family we cannot but
feel that the artist felt himself entirely at home, and in such delicate
images as those of More's ward, the youthful Anne Cresacre, or of Cicely
Heron, his daughter, we have drawings of an immediacy and tenderness as any
in the entire canon of western art.
Technically the drawings are no less astonishing, worked as they are with an
extraordinary economy of line and a quality of modelling through the form
that leaves as much described by inference as actual statement. Many of the
drawings of the later period are heavily reinforced in the outline in black
ink. This was long thought to be an effort at restoration by a later,
heavier hand, and the question is still controversial. But these are the
working studies of a portrait painter, and it does seem that Holbein shifted
from his earlier pin-prick method of transfer to one of actual tracing over
a prepared ground. The key lies perhaps in the quality still evident for the
most part in that tracing hand, the line still lively and effective in its
inflection. Holbein is still there.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Opening concert sets the theme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening concert at Edinburgh sets the festival theme. A featured
composer has always tended to be part of the music programme, but as the
number of festivals proliferates, it is increasingly important for artistic
directors to make sure that their festival looks different from the others.
In his first year as Festival Director, Brian McMaster made 1992 the year of
Tchaikovsky, cannily anticipating his centenary before other festivals could
get in. This year he has avoided all three of the big anniversary composers
(Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Rakhmaninov), which has turned out to be unnecessarily
cautious, as nobody else is paying them much serious attention either. In
their place we have Schubert and Janacek.
The festival programme describes the two composers as a 'complementary and
contrasting coupling'. This is another way of saying they have nothing in
common. One was central to the Austro-German tradition; the other wholly
outside it. One was a composer of youth; the other nearly 50 when his first
major work was performed. Janacek is remembered primarily for his operas, a
genre in which Schubert never enjoyed much success. At least the festival
audience will have varied fare on its menu.
If I had been planning the festival, I would have opened with Janacek's
Sinfonietta, which bursts into life with a blazing fanfare of massed
trumpets. McMaster preferred the suite derived by Vaclav Talich from the
opera The Cunning Little Vixen, a misleading start as the music sounds more
like Strauss in Talich's heavily romantic re-orchestration.
The welcome novelty of the evening was a rare cantata by Janacek called
Amarus. Outcast because the local community has turned against his mother, a
young man is consigned to a monastery, where he lives a miserable life until
he dies one day on his mother's grave, after watching a pair of young
lovers. All the Janacek themes that were to become familiar are here: social
prejudice, death as a release from suffering, the renewal of life. But the
music is strangely stagnant, except when it hits upon a perky little theme
for - of all things - the poor man's funeral march. Stefan Margita sang the
tenor role of Amarus without excessive morbidity.
To end: not Janacek's Glagolitic Mass, as might have been expected, but
Schubert's lyrical Mass in A flat - fairly unfamiliar music again. The
Edinburgh Festival Chorus claims the opening concert by right and sang with
all its usual fervour, though smaller professional choruses these days can
bring to music of this period a sharper focus and greater exactitude of
pitch. Walter Weller conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and a
good quartet of soloists, led by Yvonne Kenny, with the mellifluous trio of
Fiona Janes, John Mark Ainsley and Andreas Schmidt in support.
In retrospect, there is one feature that these two composers have in common:
both wrote interesting pieces of music that deserve a wider hearing. The
prospect of spending the three weeks of the festival in their company raises
one's spirits.

Britain's two main terrestrial channels are, to put it kindly, looking

Australian soap opera Neighbours, offers some news and a fashion programme,
then the British soap opera EastEnders followed by three comedy repeats -
The Good Life, May To December and French And Saunders with only another

ITV begins with the news, then the British soap, Emmerdale, followed by five

Crime, 'a series investigating the problem of rising crime and meeting the

FT  17 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: At the heart of Europe - The dominance
of UK firms in a survey of the top 500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law firm, has emerged as the leading
provider of commercial legal services in Europe, according to a survey of
Europe's top 500 companies.
UK firms took four of the top five rankings in the survey by Euromoney
Research. Linklaters &amp; Paines was second, Slaughter and May third, De Brauw
Blackstone Westbroek, the Dutch firm, fourth, and Freshfields fifth.
Respondents to the survey also found the UK the most important jurisdiction
outside their own country of head office, followed by Germany and France.
That was unlikely to change over the next two years, but they expected the
importance of Spain, Italy, Ireland, Austria, Poland, the former Soviet
Union and Sweden to increase.
In the UK commercial law field, Linklaters was ranked top, followed by
Lovell White Durrant, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, and Slaughter and May.
There were 185 respondents to the survey, with offices across 20 European
countries. The majority said they were increasing the size of their in-house
legal departments, mainly to deal with increased volumes of work rather than
to cut costs on outside law firms.
Corporate finance and joint ventures were seen as the most important areas
of in-house legal activity, after core company law and contract work.
Banking law, licensing, environmental law and tax were seen as areas of
growth activity.
The survey shows there is increasing use of international law firms. Almost
half of the respondents gave only two-fifths of their work or less to law
firms domiciled in the country where their head office was based.
More than 43 per cent did three-quarters of their legal work in-house, and
respondents expected that pattern to remain the same over the next two
years. Some 80 per cent of respondents did at least half of their general
company law work in-house.
The survey confirms the shift in the method of charging for legal services,
and the increased interest in alternative billing methods.
Over 40 per cent of respondents still paid for more than four-fifths of
their legal work on the basis of an hourly charging rate, with a further 17
per cent stating that between 61 per cent and 80 per cent of their work was
paid for on that basis.
However, 36 per cent of respondents now required law firms to provide
alternative billing methods. Of these companies, 35 per cent had used volume
discounts, 30 per cent had received discounts from the quoted hourly rate,
29 per cent had paid multi-stage fees - where the price increases as
different stages of a transaction are reached - and 21 per cent had used
fixed fees for a job.
More than 60 per cent of respondents had increased their expenditure on
legal services in the last two years.
The survey found the level of fees charged by law firms was not as high as
some recent surveys had suggested. A survey by a sister publication, the
International Financial Law Review, last year found UK law firms to be the
most expensive in the world, charging an average of Dollars 585 an hour for
legal advice from a senior partner. After the UK, Germany had the most
expensive law firms, with top commercial lawyers charging Dollars 510 an
hour, followed by Switzerland (Dollars 445) and Austria (Dollars 385).
But the Euromoney Research survey found the highest charge paid by a
respondent for international legal work was Dollars 352 an hour and the
lowest Dollars 150. The average hourly charge for international work was
Dollars 241. For domestic work the top rate was Dollars 320 an hour and the
lowest Dollars 161, with an average of Dollars 195.
The most highly paid in-house lawyer among the respondents received a total
remuneration package of Dollars 420,000 a year. The average annual
remuneration for senior in-house lawyers was Dollars 147,721, comprising
Dollars 106,064 salary, benefits of Dollars 17,136 and bonus of Dollars
24,521. Junior in-house lawyers had an average salary of Dollars 45,071,
benefits of Dollars 6,089 and Dollars 3,208 bonus.
Sponsoring or holding lectures and seminars on specialist topics was rated
by respondents as the best method for law firms to market their services,
followed by proprietary research, cross-selling of other areas of legal
practice, and expert articles in the client-oriented press.
Most respondents received an average of 17 marketing approaches a year from
law firms domestically, and an average of 23 approaches internationally.
Only 5.4 per cent of respondents had received offers by law firms of free
work for a trial period.
In spite of the need to cut costs on legal services during the recession,
cost was rated only seventh in order of priorities when choosing a law firm.
Companies rated technical ability the most important criterion, followed by
domestic capability, understanding of the markets in which firms operated
and of the industry's character, senior level support and commercial
awareness.
Although much has been made of the international expansion of law firms in
recent years, most respondents did not consider international presence as
one of the most significant factors in choosing a law firm.
In selecting a firm for the first time, a recommendation by another company
or someone whose opinions carried weight was regarded as the most important
factor. Companies also regarded a strong general reputation as important.
Only 19.6 per cent of respondents had held 'beauty parades' (where they
invited a number of firms to make presentations) when choosing a law firm.
Most respondents cast doubt on the value of such methods of selection.
Just over 20 per cent of the respondents are headquartered in the UK,
followed by just over 10 per cent in Germany and 10 per cent in France. This
could partly explain why UK firms were rated much more highly than their
continental counterparts.
But there seems little doubt that London remains Europe's pre-eminent legal
centre, and that UK firms continue to dominate the European legal scene, in
spite of the challenge from large US firms, some of which already feature
among Europe's top firms. Of the top 50 European firms overall, 23 are based
in the UK or Ireland.
The move by the Big Six international accountants into legal services is
also reflected by the survey. In Spain, for example, five of the top 10
providers of legal services were accountants.
Although the survey suggests that size and international spread do not
matter, two firms in particular stand out as having benefited both from
being bigger and having more overseas offices than other firms.
Clifford Chance, arguably the second largest law firm in the world, not only
came top overall, but was rated in the top 10 law firms in Poland, France,
the Netherlands and the UK.
Baker &amp; McKenzie the largest law firm in the world was ranked in the top 10
in no fewer than eight European countries - Belgium, CIS, Hungary, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland - as well as finishing just
outside the top 10 in the UK and France.
Size is not everything, but when it comes to providing legal services in
Europe, clearly it helps.

FT  17 AUG 93 / People: Signs of succession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, Brian Harris's successor as president of the London Chamber next
year is Brian Pearce who, at 62, is gradually lightening his commitments at
family firm Pearce Signs.
Pearce pere stays on as executive group chairman, but his 34-year-old son
Nicholas, great great great great grandson of Samuel Pearce, who founded the
company in 1791, moves from marketing director into the newly created
position of deputy chairman.
A chartered accountant who has been at the family firm for the past eight
years, Nicholas Pearce says his promotion is 'a public statement to the
doubters and interested parties that the line of succession is confirmed'.
He is likely to take over as chairman in about three years' time.
At the same time, Michael Short, who started at the company as Brian
Pearce's PA, moves up from group managing director to chief executive,
another new position. 'It is a recognition of the role he has been
performing for the past 18 months anyway,' says the seventh generation
Pearce.
Pearce has a brother and sister, neither of whom is in the business which is
the UK's biggest signmaker with annual sales running at Pounds 30m.
He also has two sons, aged four and one. 'It is a little early to foist
anything on them. If they want to be a doctor and a fireman, good luck to
them,' he says. 'I'm very practical about this. Every new generation into
the company is a bonus.'

FT  17 AUG 93 / People: Harris - support for Terminal Five
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Harris, who stepped down from the chairmanship of international
property consultants Richard Ellis in May, is to become the first chairman
of the Heathrow Airport Support Group, set up by the London Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and the Geneva-based Air Transport Action Group to
support the creation of a fifth terminal at the world's largest
international airport. A public enquiry is scheduled for next year, and
Harris expects the group to be active for at least five years.
Harris, 61, who lives under the Gatwick flightpath and hence claims to know
'a little' about aircraft noise, says it was thought sensible that the job
should be performed by someone unconnected with airlines or businesses
associated with the airport. He is currently serving the second of two years
as president of the London Chamber of Commerce.
A graduate of London University, Harris went straight to Richard Ellis. He
became chairman in 1984, and still remains a full-time partner.
He is also on the board of the London First intitiative inspired by Sir
Allen Sheppard.

<TEXT>
Anti-lawyer jokes in the US - such as: 'What do you have when a lawyer is
buried up to his neck in sand?' 'Not enough sand' - have reached such
proportions that the American Bar Association is to spend Dollars 750,000 on
trying to boost the public image of lawyers.
At its annual conference in New York last week, the ABA revealed the results
of a survey which show public perception of US lawyers at an all-time low.
Only 8 per cent of Americans now have 'great confidence' in lawyers,
compared with 12.5 per cent two years ago and 24 per cent in 1973. Meanwhile
the president of the California Bar Association recently proposed that jokes
about lawyers should be made a hate crime.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Appeal Court rules on pension funds
case - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Appeal last week refused to grant a stay on orders made by Mr
Justice Vinelott in the Melton Medes pension funds case at the end of July
removing the existing trustees and appointing Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Ipe
Jacob, partners in accountants Robson Rhodes, as judicial trustees of the
funds.
This is the first time that judicial trustees have been appointed before the
substantive case has been heard and underlines the distinction now being
drawn by the courts between conventional trusts, where such an order would
be impossible, and pension funds.
The Appeal Court, however, granted the defendants a further stay on a
pre-emptive costs order made by Mr Justice Vinelott giving the pension fund
members the right to use pension fund monies to finance their action for
breach of trust against the former trustees. The former trustees, Mr Nathu
Ram Puri, Melton Medes chairman, and Mr James Philpotts, chief executive,
have 28 days to appeal against the pre-emptive costs order.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Portuguese tax on pulp sales unlawful
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Portuguese tax on sales of domestic and imported chemical pulp, used to
help finance a national institute for forestry products, has been ruled
unlawful by the European Court of Justice.
In the context of a preliminary reference on a point of law from a Lisbon
administrative court, the ECJ said the tax was contrary to the Rome Treaty
provisions relating to customs duties and internal taxes.
The Court said the relevant Rome Treaty provisions were not cumulative. Thus
one charge could not be found to be both a customs duty (or a measure of
equivalent effect) and an internal tax for Rome Treaty purposes.
In general, the customs duties provisions were relevant to distinctly
applicable measures - where, for example, taxes were only imposed on
imported products - whereas the internal taxation provisions were relevant
to national measures affecting both domestic and imported products.
However, a tax that was distinctly applicable could fall within the customs
duties provisions of the Rome Treaty when the revenue from that tax
benefited exclusively domestic products which compensated in full the tax
paid for the national products.
Where the revenue from the tax only partially compensated the national
products, it would be dealt with under the Rome Treaty provisions on
internal taxation.
The Court also found that such a tax could be held to constitute an unlawful
state aid, but only after the correct procedures had been undertaken by the
commission under Rome Treaty provisions. The tax did not, however, fall
within the scope of the provisions of the EC treaty relating to the free
movement of goods.
C-266/91: Celulose Beira Industrial (Celbi) SA v Fazenda Publica ECJ 6CH,
August 2 1993
Member states' obligations under agreements with third countries
The European Court has ruled that national judges should apply Community law
on equal treatment between men and women by disapplying any contrary
national provisions, except insofar as the application of contrary national
provisions was necessary to fulfil obligations arising from an agreement
with a third country that predated the Rome Treaty.
The case concerned the employment of women for night work in a charcuterie
factory. French law prohibits the employment of women for night work. The
French law was adopted in pursuance of an International Labour Organisation
convention. The director of the factory was prosecuted for breach of the law
and the case was referred to the ECJ.
The Court ruled the relevant provisions of the EC equal treatment directive
obliged the national judge to apply the rules fully by disapplying any
contrary national measure.
But rights and obligations arising from agreements between member states and
third countries concluded before the Rome Treaty came into force were not
affected by the treaty.
However, to the extent that the agreements are not compatible with the
treaty, the member states concerned are obliged to take appropriate steps to
eliminate the relevant incompatibilities.
To determine whether a Community principle could be held in check by an
earlier international agreement it was necessary first to determine whether
the member state still had to fulfil its obligations under the agreement to
the third countries concerned.
If the French prohibition on night working had been repealed by later
agreements, the Rome Treaty provisions on the non-effect of the treaty on
agreements between member states and third countries would not apply.
However, it was for a national judge to determine that question.
C-158/91: Ministere Public et Direction du Travail et de l'Emploi v Levy,
ECJ FC, August 2 1993
PVC case
The August 3 report of the advocate general's opinion in this appeal may
have falsely given the impression that the Court of First Instance's
decision had been overturned. The opinion is only indicative and is not
binding on the Court which will deliver its judgment later in the year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Edmondson, the general manager for development at Irish Life, Ireland's
largest life assurance, pensions and investment group, has been appointed as
finance director to J. Rothschild International Assurance (JRIA) in Dublin.
JRIA was set up in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre in
January this year to market life assurance products into Europe on behalf of
banks and financial institutions.
The 44-year-old Edmondson speaks fluent Russian and has worked with Irish
Life for 21 years, working initially in the pensions area of its business
and moving up to become the executive in charge of developing its European
operations at the end of the 1980s, reporting to David Kingston the group
managing director. In 1990, Irish Life acquired a majority stake in David, a
Norwegian life assurance and pensions company which sells individual
pensions products through savings banks in Norway. It is planning to
introduce unit-linked products to the Norwegian market in due course.
Also under Edmondson's direction, Irish Life set up a new insurance
operation Xaar, in France in 1992, primarily writing motor and general
insurance policies, but is adding on individual life products.
Edmondson will take up his new appointment next month, and will have
responsibility for the financial and actuarial aspects of JRIA's activities.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Technology: 6,000km under the sea - A transatlantic
breakthrough for fibre optic cables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revolution is taking place in the undersea telecommunications cables
industry. New techniques for sending traffic through optical fibre are
boosting capacity and slashing prices at an extraordinary rate.
A milestone was reached this month with the placing of an order for a
transatlantic cable providing 28 times the capacity for roughly the same
price as its state-of-the-art counterpart of a decade ago.
The Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) order is for a 6,000km fibre-optic undersea
system linking Greenhill, Rhode Island in the US, with Land's End in the UK,
to be installed in 1995.
Called Tat-12, it was ordered by a consortium comprising British
Telecommunications, France Telecom and AT&amp;T of the US jointly from AT&amp;T's
own cable manufacturing arm and STC Submarine Systems, the subsidiary of
Northern Telecom which is about to be sold to Alcatel of France. The
undersea cable market is dominated by AT&amp;T, STC and Alcatel.
Tat-12, for which STC is the leading supplier, contains two fibre pairs.
Each has capacity for 60,000 telecommunications circuits, together
sufficient to carry about 600,000 simultaneous telephone calls through a
cable little thicker than a finger.
STC's first undersea fibre-optic system dates back only seven years, and its
first transatlantic system to 1988. The first generation of fibre-optic
undersea systems, including a transatlantic system still under construction,
uses the 'regeneration' technique to convey signals across long distances of
fibre. This requires elaborate, high-speed electronic 'repeaters' to be
attached to the undersea cable at regular intervals, which re-form the
signal and send it on to the next repeater.
The breakthrough was the invention of an optical amplifying mechanism that
can pass the signal along the fibre without having to regenerate it, so
dispensing with the need for high-speed, sea-bed electronics. Amplification
processes are at the leading edge of laser and fibre-optics research, making
research and development costs a significant part of each new contract.
In the new system, amplification is achieved by erbium-coated amplifiers -
short lengths of fibre leaded with a small amount of the rare earth erbium,
inserted at intervals along the transmission fibre and illuminated by
high-power lasers to boost the telecommunications signals.
Only basic electronic equipment is required. The effect is to create a
'lightpipe' whereby the optical signal put in at one end appears at the
other, provided the signal has the requisite wavelength properties.
Tat-12 is not the first STC system to use optical amplification - but it is
the first to straddle the Atlantic. STC's first optically-amplified system
was 'Rioja', an Pounds 80m system currently being manufactured for
installation between Spain, the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Rioja contains the longest optically amplified cable attempted by STC - a
900km section linking Spain and the UK. At 6,000km, Tat-12 will leave Rioja
behind, with the aid of 133 undersea amplifiers.
In terms of capacity, the advance is dramatic. Tat-11, the last
transatlantic 'repeater' cable installed by STC, has a 560Mbit/second
capacity. Conveying 23,000 circuits, it can carry about 115,000 simultaneous
telephone calls.
Tat-12, a 5 gigabit/second system, has five times that capacity.
'It is truly a revolution in the way we transmit signals under sea,' says
Phil Black, STC's technical director. 'It means we do not have to develop
another generation of high-speed, under-water electronics and gives far
greater flexibility and reliability in installation and operation.'
Tat-12 is only the start of the revolution. At its plant in Greenwich, south
London - where the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable was built
in the 1860s - STC is working on a far more sophisticated system able to
carry 10m simultaneous telephone calls - enough for the entire population of
London to speak at the same time down one cable.
The path to the next plateau is 'wavelength division multiplexing'. WDM
enables a number of optical signals, each at a slightly different
wavelength, to be sent down the same optical 'lightpipe' at the same time,
significantly increasing the number of 'channels'. Since all the dividing up
and sorting out of wavelengths takes place in stations at either end of the
cable, there would still be no need for high-speed, undersea electronic
equipment.
The story of submarine fibre-optic cables in the last decade casts a telling
sidelight on the cost of international telecommunications. STC estimates
that the cost of providing a telephone circuit by fibre between London and
New York has fallen by a factor of 10 over just the last seven years.
According to its projections, the cost is set to fall by a further factor of
10 over the next five years, courtesy of optical amplification.
Approximately 90 per cent of all BT's transatlantic calls travel by cable
and just 10 per cent by satellite.
Since 1986, BT's transatlantic call charges have fallen by about 40 per cent
in real terms. Transatlantic operators are not slow to boast about their
sizeable tariff reductions, but they need to be seen against the background
of a dramatic decline in operating and new infrastructure costs.
Greater flexibility and reductions in unit costs do not translate
immediately into lower prices. Old equipment has to be serviced and
written-off; markets have to be found for new capacity. The whole of London
is not going to telephone New York at the same time, however cheap BT's
tariffs.
'What is needed is more capacity-gobbling uses,' says Black. 'With the
long-haul use of capacity-demanding applications becoming economically
possible, opportunities for broadband applications for transferring data,
high-definition television and multimedia, are developing rapidly.'
It is not, of course, just the likes of BT and AT&amp;T that need the
capacity-gobblers; without them, suppliers such as STC may soon have
invented themselves out of business.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Technology: An outbreak of conflicting opinions - Despite
assurances that BSE is waning, there is new concern about the epidemic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow' disease -
which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave
of public concern. New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and
last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain
disorder similar to BSE.
Richard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading
critic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers
whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to
chance.
He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease.
'Our worst predictions are coming true,' he said. 'I find it unbelievable
that the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the
public there is no danger.'
The advisers, led by the government's chief medical officer Kenneth Calman
and chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, put out a detailed statement to
justify their view that last month's death of 65-year-old Duncan Templeman -
following that of Peter Warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed 'no features that
give cause for undue concern'.
The official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even
though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a
disease as rare as CJD. Robert Will of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital,
who has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health
department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of
even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE-affected
herds.
One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a
long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms
would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD.
'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman's herd) and the patient
occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had
presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,' the health
department said.
'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the
cases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.'
Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features
typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually
occurs in late middle age.
The handful of patients known to have developed CJD through infection (from
contaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms.
The second annual report of Will's National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a
disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991
to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3. But the report says that this is not
statistically significant and is probably due to increasing awareness of CJD
(some cases were previously attributed to Alzheimer's or other forms of
dementia).
Meanwhile, cattle are succumbing to BSE at a rate of about one per 100 every
year. The epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture's
predictions that it is about to wane; so far this year there have been
26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year.
The source of infection was protein-rich cattle feed contaminated with
scrapie, a related brain disease of sheep. Although sheep-derived feeds were
banned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existing
stocks for longer than the ministry had expected. The incubation period is
also longer than originally expected.
Veterinary experts say that almost all of the 102,000 confirmed BSE cases so
far can be attributed to scrapie-contaminated feed. According to their
investigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf - which would prolong
the epidemic - is very rare or non-existent.
Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE,
scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which
does not follow the normal rules of microbiology.
Recent research shows that the prion is an abnormal form of a protein that
is normally present in the brain (though its normal function is not yet
known). Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material of
their own.
The prion may arise by a genetic mutation (spontaneous or inherited) in the
host animal. Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
Once in place in the victim's brain, it catalyses what John Collinge, a
prion researcher at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, called a slow
'chemical chain reaction', converting the normal protein into its own
abnormal form. The prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely
stable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation.
Experiments show that BSE can be transmitted between species, for example
from cow to monkey, by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue.
But 'transmission is dose dependent,' Collinge says.
Most independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef
eater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop
brain disease.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeking a new balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing need for small firms to collaborate in research and development,
training and even marketing is often in conflict with their urge to compete.
So a recent study on how the Mittelstand in the Baden-Wurttemberg region is
dealing with the dilemma is of potentially wider European interest.
The Mittelstand is the collective name for the thousands of small and
medium-sized companies whose remarkable export success was one of the
foundations of Germany's post war economic prosperity. But as Philip Cooke,
Kevin Morgan and Adam Price of the Department of City &amp; Regional Planning at
the University of Wales College of Cardiff point out * a crisis of
confidence has hit the whole sector.
Nowhere is it more evident than in Baden-Wurttemberg, where one of the
biggest threats comes from the car industry's increased tendency to source
overseas on the one hand and to deepen relationships with a smaller number
of domestic suppliers on the other. In machine tools, the fear is that the
Mittelstand is too fragmented to stay abreast of new technologies and to
meet the threat of more cost-effective Japanese rivals.
Many companies, however, are sceptical of 'horizontal collaboration' as a
means of easing the financial burden - the Mittelstand's apparent strength,
fierce independence of a dynamic owner-manager, therefore becomes its
weakness.
The report examines in detail the state's novel regional innovation
strategy, which in contrast with the French dirigiste approach tries to
establish a new balance between collaboration and competition. It continues
to respect the sovereignty of the firm, but with the help of new incentives
it encourages companies to recognise the limits of autonomous action.
Formidable problems remain and the most pessimistic think the region's
overdependence on the mature auto industry could make it 'the Ruhrgebiet of
the 21st century'.
But the authors say it would be foolish to underestimate the capacity for
renewal given the 'new mood' and the region's industrial, technical and
institutional resources.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Beyond the corner shop -
Asian businesses in Britain are widening their ambitions and their appeal
under the influence of a second generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KHOZEM MERCHANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prophet motive is paramount at the Halal Meat Company. By observing the
Islamic traditions on the slaughter of animals (known as halal), the
Birmingham butcher says it has maintained its integrity; with a captive
Moslem market, its Asian owners say their profit has risen handsomely.
The Halal group has grown rapidly since Hafiz Yaqoob, the founder, passed
effective management control to his sons, Zahid and Shahid, five years ago.
The brothers have developed the core activity, employed, for the first time,
non-Asian managers and launched a range of convenience foods under their own
brand name, Mr Halal's Kitchen.
The Yaqoob brothers are among an increasing number of second-generation
British-educated Asians taking their small to medium-sized family-run
businesses out of the street corner and into main street. But unlike their
fathers this new generation is bringing to their ventures a greater
awareness of the wider business environment. This is exposing a gulf in
business values and sowing the seeds of potential clashes over the
conflicting demands of commerce and culture. In any event, their impact is
likely to be felt in two broad areas:
Internal organisation. Many Asian-owned businesses were launched as a
vehicle for family employment and have been run around shared family
responsibilities. Rapid growth over the past two decades has seldom
triggered internal changes necessary to manage the larger venture. The
management scrutiny exercised by a second generation is often the first time
that these companies have undergone such an examination.
Easing dependency on the ethnic markets many companies were set up to serve,
by pitching products further afield.
As in many small businesses, the first thing a second generation does is to
create an organised structure and then decide what to develop or ditch, says
James Curran of Kingston University and the author of a study on ethnic
businesses for the Midland Bank. In Asian-owned companies, he adds, a
second-generation is likely to be more receptive to the need for change than
would be the case in a traditional mainstream family business.
Reorganising their business was the first task confronting the Yaqoobs when
their father's illness forced them into the hot seat. 'Most of my 10 years
have been spent setting up systems - for finance, sales, shopfloor work and
buying, says Zahid Yaqoob, 31, managing director.
Similarly, when Imran Ahmad, 34, took over his family bed-and-breakfast in
Newcastle upon Tyne, he found a business resembling some he had studied
during his MBA at Bradford University.
'The business had plodded along in a haphazard way. A business plan was
never produced. The biggest problem was controlling the books. I started
looking at these while on visits from Bradford and was drawn into the
business,' he says.
One early responsibility for both Imran Ahmad and Zahid Yaqoob was dealing
with banks.
Many first-generation Asians recall with indignation their treatment by
clearing banks. Mutual accusations of misunderstanding abound. A second
generation is undoubtedly more sensitive to the banks' point of view. 'I was
the essential link between the bank and a business which had to expand. What
the banks said (on business plans etc) made sense to me, though not to my
father,' says Imran Ahmad.
Zahid Yaqoob and Imran Ahmad's overhauls, though on a different scale, led
to an unpalatable truth - that to manage a growing business professionally,
managers and skilled staff would have to be employed from outside the family
or a dependent ethnic labour force. Traditionally, this option has been
eschewed. Many such businesses fear losing control and are, in any case,
suspicious of outsiders.
Yet this could change. 'If you have a professional management, then it will
insist on skilled workers and jobs based on merit,' says Robert Blackburn of
Kingston University and co-author of the Midland report. 'In Asian
businesses, this is something that only the second generation can
introduce.'
Competitive pressures are also likely to erode Asian companies'
traditionally homogeneous labour force. Better quality products require more
skilled workers. That will force many to the wider labour market.
Blackburn says: 'There are some special pressures on Asian-owned companies.
As a result of a fall in immigration and better education among British
Asians, they are going to have to offer improved jobs packages.'
At London food manufacturer Noon Products, Zeenat Harnal, a director and
daughter of the founder, G K Noon, says only by employing professionals can
the company meet the standards set by its biggest client - Sainsbury.
'We have had to employ food technologists, microbiologists for our
laboratory and now quality control experts for our B5750 registration (on
quality standards). Our clients welcome this and it reflects our
commitment,' she says.
Noon Products' foothold in the quality end of the frozen food market
illustrates the second area of activity likely to pre-occupy a second
generation - easing dependency or even escaping from the narrow consumer
base of an ethnic market. More than two-thirds of Noon Products' frozen
Indian meals are sold to Sainsbury. Frozen Indian meals are not very popular
with Asians. This successful targeting of the mainstream market, says Upkar
Pardesi, a small companies specialist at the University of Central England
in Birmingham, serves as a useful model.
'The new generation must realise that the only way to grow is by expanding
out of the niche market,' he says. 'A new generation will certainly bring
more market focus. But it will only work if it ensures the family business
possesses the internal structures to absorb new ideas, products and big
orders.'
Imran Ahmad achieved 'market focus' by moving his B&amp;B away from the student
end where his father had opted for an easy return on a largely self-managing
business, to the business-client market. He invested about Pounds 100,000 in
transforming his 12-room B&amp;B into a 27-bedroom hotel. 'We made a big
qualitative move. The only way to develop was to position ourselves in the
growing end of the market.'
For Zahid Yaqoob, expanding out of the narrow 'Islamic' market was vital.
'Our business could not have carried on if we just sold meat to Moslems in
Britain.' He led the move into value-added products such as Halal burgers
and sausages. The company is also assembling a 'multi-million pound' project
to open abattoirs in Europe to add to the five it runs in the UK and
Ireland.
These moves into new markets, allied with big internal changes, can add
tension to a management team that straddles different cultures. Imran Ahmad
points to irritating management issues such as dealing with builders 'who
knew there was no one person in charge and sought to exploit it'. This, he
says, cost the hotel unnecessary expense.
Though many second-generation Asians command a remarkable degree of
responsibility at a young age, there is no doubting that the founder remains
in overall charge. Zeenat Harnal, 32, leads 60 mainly female production
workers; Zahid Yaqoob recruited and heads a team of 'proven meat industry
managers'. Both say they bow to their fathers' word.
So what if differences occur between conservative founders and their dynamic
successors? 'Internal cultural tensions could affect the market position of
a company and ultimately its success,' says Ellis Cashmore, of Aston
Business School. He cites the example of a large cash and carry business in
Birmingham, owned by a Moslem for whom alcohol is prohibited. The owner's
son, who was the finance director and also regarded himself as a faithful
Moslem, presented a compelling commercial case for selling alcohol, but was
overruled by his father.
This is an example of how culture can damage commerce. Marrying these twin
imperatives could yet prove a profitable path.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A guide to going public -
In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market flotation has returned to favour as a means of raising
funds for growth. Many recent flotations have involved companies, many of
them management buy-outs, backed by the venture capital industry.
Venture capitalists would once have regarded a trade sale to a larger
business as the natural 'exit' route from their investments. But fresh
enthusiasm for new issues on the part of institutional investors has meant a
flotation can result in a better price for the business.
The revised edition of Going Public, a guide* to a London stock market
listing by merchant bankers Samuel Montagu explains the methods, timetable
and likely cost of such a move. A glossary explains the mysteries of
clawbacks, red herrings and the yellow book.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Single market aids larger
companies - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses have done badly from the creation of the European single
market with, in the early stages at least, most benefits going to large
companies, according to a survey* by the 3i/Cranfield European Enterprise
Centre.
Fifty four per cent of companies employing fewer than 50 people reported
increased competition, while only 33 per cent had boosted exports. Among
larger companies (with up to 500 employees) 46 per cent had experienced more
competition, but 44 per cent raised exports.
German companies appeared to be planning to make the most of the single
market with just over half setting up some form of collaborative deal in
Europe. In other countries between 20 and 28 per cent had done so.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Crown Agents to be privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROWN AGENTS, the government-controlled procurement, technical and
financial services agency, is to be privatised as an independent foundation.
The move is intended to free the organisation to pursue a wider range of
business, operating as a private-sector entity while maintaining the
reputation for impartiality and integrity that has made its services
attractive to leading aid agencies such as the World Bank, and to national
aid programmes such as those of Japan or the European Community.
Privatisation of the Crown Agents, which employs 650 people from a
headquarters in south London, has been under discussion since December.
The organisation, which yesterday welcomed the change, had feared that
full-scale privatisation would undermine its credibility as an 'honest
broker' in the supply of procurement and financial services.
At the same time it will no longer be bound by government policy to act as
an agent only for other public-sector entities. It will be able to offer its
services to private-sector corporations and be able to tap the financial
markets for funds if it wants to expand.
The Crown Agents has operated at no cost to the exchequer for several years,
with three-quarters of its business financed from sources other than the UK
aid programme. Over the 10 years to 1991 it brought procurement orders worth
about Pounds 2bn to almost 8,000 UK companies. It manages the equivalent of
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) on behalf of 300 governments or public bodies.
In the past year it has been active in the reconstruction of eastern and
central Europe.
In February this year it was appointed by Japan's foreign ministry to
procure food for distribution in Russia as part of Japan's first emergency
humanitarian aid package to former Soviet republics totalling Dollars 100m.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Peugeot ends production of 405 in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT-TALBOT, the UK subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French
carmaker, is ending production of the Peugeot 405 large family car at its
assembly plant at Ryton, Coventry because of falling new car sales in
continental Europe.
Production at Ryton is to be limited to one model, the Peugeot 306 small
family car. Total output at the plant is being reduced to about 1,600 a week
from the level earlier in the year of 1,900 a week.
About 300 jobs are being cut from the workforce of 5,280 (excluding the
group's Robins and Day retail dealerships).
The ending of 405 production in the UK is a big setback for the Ryton plant,
which only resumed production of two car ranges in January with the launch
of the Peugeot 306.
The Peugeot group is cutting production at Ryton as part of its overall
reduction in output across its European plants in response to the sharp
decline in west European new car sales this year. New-car sales in west
Europe fell by an estimated 17.7 per cent in the first seven months of the
year, while sales in France, where Peugeot's market share is being seriously
eroded, have fallen by 17.1 per cent.
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is also cutting
output at its two UK assembly plants in response to the fall in European
sales.
Production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra at its plant at Luton,
Bedfordshire is being stopped this week with the loss of nine shifts while
night-shift production of the Vauxhall/Opel Astra at its plant at Ellesmere
Port, Cheshire, is also being eliminated this week with the loss of four
shifts. A further three shifts will be eliminated at the Luton plant later
this month. In the first eight months of the year Vauxhall will have cut 60
production shifts at the Luton plant and 10 at Ellesmere Port.
Vauxhall vehicle output rose by 15.3 per cent last year to a record 301,857.
In the first seven months of this year it has fallen 11.1 per cent to
161,792 from 181,919 in the same period the year before. Output of the
Cavalier/Vectra fell by 22 per cent in the first six months to 70,681.
Ford, the biggest UK vehicle maker, which had already cut capacity across
its European assembly plants late last year, has also been forced to
implement a limited amount of short-time working.
Production at its Southampton Transit van plant was halted yesterday with
the loss of two shifts, although normal output will be resumed today.
In the first eight months of the year Ford has cut 22 shifts at the
Southampton van plant, 24 shifts at the Halewood, Merseyside assembly plant
which produces the Escort/Orion range and five at the Fiesta small-car
assembly plant in Dagenham, east London.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Average consumer credit 'falls by 3%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS CONTINUED to pay off their debts in the second quarter of this
year, with the number of people slightly in arrears on credit repayments
falling compared with a year ago.
Infolink, the credit information group, reported that the value of an
average outstanding consumer-credit commitment was 3 per cent lower in the
second quarter than in the same period a year earlier.
The latest survey of lenders' instalment credit agreements - mainly loans on
credit cards and hire purchase agreements - found that 90.5 per cent of
instalment credit accounts were up to date. This compares with 90.2 per cent
in the corresponding period a year ago.
The average value of credit agreements in the survey was Pounds 3,500.
While the percentage of accounts in arrears for up to three months was down
on a year ago, those for more than three months rose slightly.
Mr Brian Bailey, chairman of Infolink, said: 'While consumers are more
financially stable than they were a year ago, it would appear that the
economic climate has not improved sufficiently to alleviate all consumers
from the burden of debt.'

FT  17 AUG 93 / Engineers' training review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Engineering Construction Industry Training Board, one of the two
remaining bodies able to levy its industry to pay for training in its
sector, is to undergo a review.
The board, which was the training committee of the Engineering Industry
Training Board, was set up as a separate entity in 1991.
Its operations were to be reviewed every three years.
Most training boards have been abolished by the government, which prefers a
voluntary approach to compulsory levies for training. However, the ECITB and
the Construction Industry Training Board were allowed to remain because of
the particular training problems of their industries, where employees tend
to be on contracts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric has formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of the
US oil company Marathon to sell gas to commercial and industrial customers.
The joint-venture company, Vector Gas, will initially sell gas in
Hydro-Electric's electricity licence area in the north of Scotland but will
later operate in England and Wales. Hydro-Electric's partner is Marathon
Gas, which sells gas from the North Sea's Brae fields, where Marathon Oil is
operator.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Decline in empty London offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT of available office space in central London has fallen by 17 per
cent from its peak of 34.3m sq ft in the middle of last year, figures from
property advisers DTZ Debenham Thorpe show, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The figures reflect a gradual rise in demand, a sharp decline in the amount
of property under construction and the effects of the City bomb in April,
which forced landlords to withdraw damaged offices from the letting market
and prompted tenants to relocate to new premises.
In spite of this improvement the central London office market is still very
depressed by historic standards. It has about 28.6m sq ft of empty space,
equivalent to 23 Canary Wharf towers or 15 per cent of its total office
stock.
Take-up in the second quarter of this year totalled 3.1m sq ft, up 40 per
cent from the first three months of the year.
The largest fall in availability occured in the City, where it fell by 14
per cent over the second quarter of the year. Take-up rose by more than 140
per cent to 1.3m sq ft, helped by the relocations that resulted from the
City bomb, which took up an extra 500,000 sq ft. The Health &amp; Safety
Executive, a government agency, is expected to agree soon a deal to rent
Rose Court, a 157,000 sq ft building in Southwark that is owned by Postel,
the UK's largest pension fund. The building, which was built over the
remains of Shakespeare's Rose Theatre, has been empty since completion in
1991.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Scotland braves the invasion of the food chains / A look at
the battle between superstores and discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN J. Sainsbury opened its first superstore in Edinburgh in June the
results surpassed even its own expectations. Of five stores opened in the UK
that month, Edinburgh was by far the busiest, making it one of Sainsbury's
most successful openings for years.
Food retailers, having slugged it out for market share in English high
streets, are now targeting the Pounds 4bn spent on food every year in
Scotland. As debate rages in the UK food market about increasing saturation
and the threat to profits growth, many chains believe Scotland still offers
big opportunities for expansion.
Sainsbury, the UK's largest food retailer, opened its first Scottish
superstore, a 42,000 sq ft flagship at Darnley in Glasgow, only last year.
It is now working on a site at East Kilbride and is 'almost at the planning
stage' in Ayr.
Planning permission is being sought for a store in Kirkcaldy, Fife and it is
looking at another site 'on the other side of Edinburgh'.
The other big new competitors are the growing breed of hard discounters
which sell a narrow range of products at very low prices. There were hardly
any in Scotland before 1990, when Shoprite, based in the Isle of Man, opened
its first stores. Shoprite now has 50 stores.
Mr David Webster, deputy managing director, believes discounting will be
more successful in Scotland than in the UK as a whole, where it is forecast
to take 15 per cent of the market by 1996.
He expects discounters, including Shoprite and new entrants such as Kwik
Save and Netto, to be operating 350 Scottish stores by 1996 and to grab a 25
per cent share of the food market.
Scotland has long been neglected by some of the biggest grocery chains. Only
Argyll, which has 22 per cent of the market through its Safeway and Presto
stores, Asda with 15 per cent, and the co-operative societies, have a
significant presence.
Wm Low, the Dundee-based chain, has about 15 per cent of the market but
small independent grocers still dominate many areas. There are fears that
many will now be squeezed between the superstores and the discounters.
Sainsbury faces a formidable competitor in Safeway, which admits it will do
'everything possible to retain market share'. As if to drive home the point,
Sir Alistair Grant, Argyll's Scottish chairman, said in a recent speech that
he was pleased to have the chance to talk about four things close to his
heart: 'Food, farming, Safeway and Scotland'.
Safeway has already outbid Sainsbury for two prime sites. One is The Gyle,
less than three miles from Sainsbury's new Edinburgh store, on a main route
into the city from the west. Safeway is thought to have spent Pounds 47m on
acquiring the site and building a 45,000 sq ft flagship due to open this
autumn, alongside a new 72,000 sq ft Marks and Spencer superstore.
The other site is at Anniesland, in Glasgow, where Safeway is said to be
spending Pounds 22m on a 35,000 sq ft store that will open next summer. It
has other stores opening in Stirling and is replacing an older store in
Dumfries.
Sainsbury has also had planning problems. It clashed with Glasgow city
council and Strathclyde regional council over a site at Braehead, on the
south-west bank of the Clyde. Planning permission was granted only after an
appeal to the secretary of state for Scotland. Sainsbury is also reported to
be having planning difficulties with a store at Milngavie, to the north of
the city.
Glasgow city council's preference for high-street developments over
out-of-town superstores might favour the discount sector, where expansion is
forecast to be fastest. Shoprite expects to have 70 stores by the end of
this year, and to open at least 29 next year. It believes it will have 200
stores by 1996, with up to 30 in Edinburgh alone.
Kwik Save announced earlier this year that it planned to open between 180
and 200 stores in Scotland. Mr Terry Atkinson, property director, said it
expected 20 to 25 store openings a year, with the first due before the end
of this year. The company held presentations for 250 property agents in
Glasgow and Edinburgh in May and June and is said to have pinpointed nine
potential sites in Edinburgh.
Netto, the Danish discount retailer, considered launching in Scotland three
years ago when it opened its first stores in the UK.
It went first to northern England, but it will open its first Scottish
stores this year.
Mr John Buitekant, trading controller, said: 'Scotland has a very similar
profile to Denmark in terms of population and area, and in Denmark we have
170 stores.
'Scotland has never had the choice that England has had. Our observations
tell us it should be ripe for limited-line discounting.' But he denied
suggestions that the rapid spread of discounters in Scotland would threaten
small, independent grocers. 'We stock 650 basic, staple-diet products. You
can't get a full shop from a Netto store.'
The presence of a Netto on a high street might increase traffic flow, and
create a spin-off for local businesses, he said.
But some grocers are seen as vulnerable and the collapse of Norco, the
Aberdeen-based co-operative society which went into liquidation in June,
highlighted potential weaknesses in the co-operative movement. Scottish
stores are bracing themselves for the new invasion from the south.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Sales rise across most retail sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENCOURAGING rise in shop, store and supermarket sales last month was
spread fairly evenly across all retail sectors, the Confederation of British
Industry says in a report today.
Clothing and footwear were the most buoyant sectors reported in this month's
distributive trades survey, with a positive balance of 55 per cent in both
categories reporting an improvement in sales.
Neither sector expects the positive trend to be reversed in the near future.
Clothing retailers forecast sales to be well above average this month, and
most respondents in the footwear sector expect sales to be about average for
the time of year.
Sales of cars rose in July, reversing the falls reported in May and June. A
positive balance of 8 per cent of traders in this category saw a rise in
sales last month.
Although a higher number of respondents expect to sell more vehicles this
month, they do not think sales will match August's usual level.
In the wholesale sector a positive balance of 35 per cent of respondents
reported higher sales in the year to July - the fifth month of year-on-year
increases.
However, while sales have increased faster than orders, a larger number of
wholesalers now consider stock levels to be excessive.
The survey, conducted between July 20 and August 4, covered 15,000 outlets
in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades. Its findings also include:
With orders placed by retailers with suppliers increasing at a slower rate
than the volume of sales, fewer retailers reported excessive stock levels. A
positive balance of 20 per cent of retailers felt stocks were excessive,
down from 26 per cent last month. Mail order companies were the only
category to report stock levels that exactly matched expected demand.
For the eighth consecutive month grocers reported a sharp increase in sales
compared with the previous year. A positive balance of 38 per cent expect
sales to increase next month.
Off-licences reported a further sharp fall in sales in the year to July.
Sales in this sector have decreased every month since June last year.
Booksellers and stationers had another month of healthy sales growth, with
almost half of the respondents reporting an improvement. Chemists reported a
sizeable increase in sales, but in spite of 12 months of almost continuous
improvements, sales are still below normal. Sales of furniture and carpets
increased in the year to July.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Private plans for child secure units attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals to contract out secure accommodation for children
yesterday met a negative response across the private and voluntary sectors.
Group 4 Securitas, the security company which runs the Wolds prison on
Humberside for the government, said it was 'highly unlikely' to enter the
market, while leading charities in the field, including National Children's
Home, Barnardo's, and the Salvation Army, attacked the proposals and called
for their withdrawal.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, published a consultation paper
calling for secure accommodation for children placed in care or remanded by
the courts to be opened to providers other than local authorities.
Mrs Bottomley said local authorities would continue to have an 'essential'
role as providers, but that demand for the service was rising.
She added that the children involved, some with criminal records and others
with 'severe emotional problems', were 'the most difficult to help in the
care system'.
Group Four said: 'This work is particularly focused on an area where we are
not able to put forward any better expertise than that which the local
authorities have.'
Mr Tom White, chief executive of National Children's Home, said: 'NCH
continues to be strongly opposed to the introduction of secure training
centres and under no circumstances would NCH be prepared to bid to run such
centres.'
He added: 'NCH believes that the government's preoccupation with secure
accommodation is inappropriate, and that imprisoning young people reinforces
criminal behaviour.' Any secure provision should be organised to ensure
'there can be no incentive to any organisation to see an increase in
provision'.
Mr Mike Jarman, director of childcare for Barnardo's, supported this view.
He said: 'We consider this a statutory-sector responsibility, and not a
charitable task. We doubt whether the necessary competence exists within the
private sector to provide such accommodation.'
The Associations of County Councils and Metropolitan Authorities, both
Labour-controlled, criticised the proposals.
Mr Jack Bury, of the ACC's social services committee, said; 'Local
authorities are in the business of providing total care for these young
people, which is as much about rehabilitation as containment. If profit is a
priority, it is difficult to see how the private sector could offer anything
more than the latter.'
Labour described the proposals as 'a blatant bid to cover up Conservative
failure on crime'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week of action was launched yesterday to highlight the plight of small
grocers, who are facing increasing competition from superstores based
outside main shopping areas, Neil Buckley writes.
Independent Grocer magazine, which is leading the campaign, has written to
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, calling for a moratorium on
superstore developments, and to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, warning that 'endless bureaucracy' is crippling small grocery
businesses. It will stage a series of special events and bring out a special
edition to illustrate the difficulties faced by small shops.
It says that tens of thousands of small grocers have closed in the past two
decades, although the sick, the elderly, the disabled, and those without
transport rely on them.
The British Independent Grocers' Association claims superstores destroy
rather than create jobs, as every job in a new superstore can cost up to
four jobs in small businesses forced to close.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Big energy users scorn price-reduction scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG INDUSTRIAL energy users yesterday scorned an initiative by the
electricity 'pool' to reduce the cost of power.
The Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents companies such as British
Steel and Imperial Chemical Industries, said it was bitterly disappointed by
the measures.
Mr Ian Blakey, the group's chairman, said: 'The benefit which the proposed
scheme would bring to the membership was estimated to be a fraction of 1 per
cent, and would barely cover the administration costs of participation.'
The pool, where electricity is traded on a wholesale basis, approved a
scheme which it said would reduce prices by an average of 1.5 per cent and
up to 3 per cent. This would enable 'demand-side bidding', where customers
could agree not to take electricity if it went above a certain price.
Mr Blakey said an alternative scheme that would have brought larger savings
had been rejected by the pool members, who consist of the leading power
generation and distribution companies.
The group intends to appeal against the pool's decision to Offer, the
electricity regulator.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Price war declared in travel trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK, the UK's third-biggest travel agency chain, yesterday fired the
opening salvo in the campaign for customers next summer, offering a 10 per
cent discount on all holidays in its new package tour brochure.
Mr Tony Bennett, Cook's director of strategic marketing, said: 'There is a
retail price war about to break out with a good chance of blood being spilt
in the next six months. We intend to be very aggressive on price.'
Last night Pickfords and Hogg Robinson said they too would be offering 10
per cent discounts on their summer 1994 overseas holidays. Mr Andrew Jones,
Pickfords marketing manager, said: 'With more buying power through (our)
larger base, it is Thomas Cook's blood which will be spilled.'
Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest travel agent, will unveil its new brochure on
Thursday. Today Thomson, the market leader among tour operators, launches
its 1994 brochure, followed by Owners Abroad next week.
Mr Bennett said competition in the industry had been increased by
consolidation. In the past year tour operator Airtours has bought Pickfords
and Hogg Robinson, and Thomas Cook has taken a 20 per cent stake in Owners.
In addition to its opening discount offer - due to run for only a few weeks
 -Cook is continuing a promise to match any other lower price offered by a
rival chain.
This summer's top destinations are predicted to be favourites again next
year. Spain, Portugal and Turkey head the list. Cook also expects France to
be popular.
The group, which is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, expects the
package holiday market to grow by 10 per cent next year, equivalent to an
extra 1m passengers.
The gradual growth in self-catering is expected to continue. Ten years ago
the self-catering market accounted for about 15 per cent of package
holidays. This year it reached 43 per cent and Cook expects it to rise to 50
per cent next year.
As part of the link with Owners, Cook will market the Enterprise holiday
brand as its own. It expects to sell between 50,000 and 100,000 Enterprise
holidays next year.
Mr Bennett said the winners of the price war were the consumers, but at some
cost. 'Discounting is against the consumer interest in the long term because
travel agents and operators alike are unable to make the investments that
will ensure improving quality.'
Owners will also use the launch of its 1994 brochure to try to revive its
fortunes. The company recently issued a profits warning to shareholders.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Gooda Walker Names fail to heed cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN 7 per cent of the money owed by Names on the worst-affected
syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance market had been paid by a
deadline which expired yesterday.
Less than Pounds 10m of the Pounds 154m demanded from the members of the
Gooda Walker syndicates in mid-June had been received by the end of Monday
afternoon - an indication of the financial difficulties many of the Names
face.
The cash call affected the 4,500 Names - the individuals whose assets
underwrite the market - on Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 290, 295, 296, 298,
299 and 387.
Mr Ken Randall, a director of GW Run Off, the agency supervising the affairs
of the seven stricken syndicates, estimated that only Pounds 5m to Pounds
10m had been received. But he played down the significance of the shortfall,
stressing that previous cash calls had also taken some time to collect.
He said: 'We have had several millions come in today, but I would not expect
it to be coming in by the bucket-full.'
Mr Randall said he would only become worried if GW Run Off had not received
20 per cent to 25 per cent of the cash calls within two months.
He said slow repayment reflected the fact that earlier demands from the
syndicates had absorbed the more liquid funds of Names, who needed more time
to realise their remaining assets.
The June demand came on top of five previous cash calls between July 1991
and February this year, totalling Pounds 639m, from losses in previous
underwriting years dating back as far as 1983. He said that only Pounds 51m
remained outstanding from these calls.
After appeals for more time to pay, the deadline for the latest call was
extended from the end of July until mid-August. The amount demanded was also
reduced slightly from Pounds 157m to Pounds 154m.
Those who have not met their cash calls by yesterday can expect to be
charged 2 per cent interest above bank base rates on the amounts
outstanding.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Watchdog weighs 'green' costs for industry: Pollution
Inspectorate chief David Slater talks to David Lascelles about his tricky
task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID SLATER, director of the Pollution Inspectorate, has launched a
study of the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. This is to
bring 'more transparency', he says, to an issue which always triggers strong
public emotions.
He also thinks it will help Britain to avoid the excessively rigid
environmental regulation he sees in some Continental countries.
Events this year have shown just how strong those emotions can be. Two weeks
ago his inspectorate came under attack for authorising two power stations to
burn orimulsion, the 'filthy fuel' decried by environmentalists.
A few weeks earlier he caused a similar storm when he approved an
authorisation for Thorp, the nuclear waste processing plant in Cumbria,
although on that occasion ministers decided that more consultation was
needed. At the start of this year the inspectorate set emission limits for
power stations which were denounced by critics as a sell-out to the
electricity industry.
More controversy is likely as the inspectorate nears a decision to authorise
Britain's latest nuclear power station, Sizewell B, for which consultations
started last week.
Given the nature of the job it is hardly surprising that Mr Slater finds
himself amid conflicting pressures, from business, politicians and
environmental pressure groups.
He has experienced pollution at close quarters. A consultant engineer by
background, he has worked on a number of industrial disasters including
Flixborough, Seveso in Italy, Bhopal in India and Exxon Valdez in North
America.
He took on the job in 1991, shortly after the enactment of the Environmental
Protection Act, which he is responsible for implementing. He describes it as
'a sophisticated piece of legislation' which allows him room for manoeuvre.
'We don't have the radar gun approach of some of the Continental countries.
Here people can sit down and talk about the realities rather than being told
'thou shalt . . .' '
Mr Slater also has to deal with his political masters - in this case Mr John
Gummer, the environment secretary. There have been suggestions that the
politicians have been trying to get him to soften his approach because of
the fragility of the economy, for example by easing the pressure on power
stations. Yet he says they respect his independence.
The fact that the environment is a less pressing political priority than it
used to be might be thought to weaken his position. Mr Slater takes comfort
from the fact that the environment has become one of several issues that
have to be weighed, rather than the clear number one priority. He believes
this is more likely to produce a balanced result.
One of Mr Slater's concerns is to weigh the cost and benefits of pollution
controls. The recent orimulsion case was fairly clear cut. Tests showed that
the fuel was, on balance, no dirtier than coal or fuel oil, so there was no
case for banning it on environmental grounds.
Less clear, however, was Mr Slater's reason for allowing the stations to
burn the fuel for five years without clean-up equipment. His reply is that
it was 'unreasonable' to ask the generators to install this equipment
immediately, but he will maintain a dialogue with the generators to ensure
that the equipment is ready once the five years are up.
He uses words such as 'proportionate', 'selective' and 'tractable' to
describe the sort of environmental regime he wants to create. There is no
point in forcing companies to spend vast sums of money to achieve marginal
improvements in emission levels, he says. In any case the Environmental
Protection Act requires the inspectorate to follow the principle of 'best
available techniques not entailing excessive cost'.
He says: 'We're not in the business of putting business out of business.'
Nor does he like to wield a big stick, such as the threat of cancelling
licences. 'We want to get into long-term dialogue with companies and build
confidence.'
Although environmentalists accuse him of being soft on polluting industries,
he spends much of his time trying to persuade industry of the value of
environmental regulation. 'Regulatory pressure, done the right way and with
intelligence, can do good. It encourages the survival of the fittest. It can
force a company to be aware of what it's doing and of its impact.'
He likes to cite examples of companies that achieved large cost savings
after being forced to tighten up their waste and emissions. One study
project which he supported in the Aire and Calder valleys in the Yorkshire
area recruited 11 companies, each of which was able to identify worthwhile
savings by cleaning up its operations. One of them, Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes
Beverage, produced annual savings of Pounds 1.6m.
It is a question of lining up environmental, efficiency and economic
objectives so that they all aim towards the same goal.
'It's all basically about eliminating waste,' he says.

STRIKING POSTAL workers in Cardiff will vote today on whether to end the
dispute that has disrupted mail in the Welsh capital for two weeks.
Officials of the UCW communication union yesterday told a meeting of the 900
postal workers of a framework agreement on shift patterns that was
negotiated last week between the union and Royal Mail.
But the ballot on calling off the strike was postponed until today. The
ballot will carry a recommendation from both national and branch officials
to accept the agreement.
Mr Steve Bell, Cardiff branch secretary of the UCW, said after yesterday's
meeting: 'Branch officers believe that the agreement represents a
substantial concession - a victory for the workforce. However, the workforce
will make the final decision itself.
'Whatever the decision is, we have demonstrated that attempts by an
unaccountable management to impose antisocial working patterns upon the
Cardiff workforce have been defeated.'
Royal Mail welcomed the ballot and hoped that the outcome would be
favourable. It said that if there was a return to work today, it would take
about a week to clear the backlog of 1m items of mail.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Aircraft workers fear big job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS AT British Aerospace's Jetstream subsidiary yesterday expressed
concern that the company might be considering large redundancies, after it
warned employees of the difficulties it faced.
Mr Allan MacDonald, managing director of Jetstream, which is based at
Prestwick, Ayrshire, told the workforce that the company would have to
realign 'production programmes with market demand and reduce significantly
our operating costs'.
He said Jetstream would be undermining its long-term viability if it failed
to take 'prompt action to stem cash haemorrhaging and minimise production of
aircraft for which we have no confirmed customers'.
Mr MacDonald said he would meet senior executives to review the business. An
announcement is expected in the next two weeks.
The company, which employs 2,500 at Prestwick, manufactures 19-seat
Jetstream 31 and 29-seat Jetstream 41 turbo-prop airliners. The Prestwick
plant is building its first 64-seat Jetstream ATP (advance turbopropeller)
aircraft after production of this model was transferred from Woodford near
Manchester.
Shop stewards said that though although sales of the Jetstream 31 and 41
were holding up, orders for next year were 'thin on the ground'.
Mr George Bell, the union convener for the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, said he hoped there would be no redundancies.
The unions had sought a meeting with management but did not expect it until
later this week.
Mr MacDonald told employees: 'Our competitors are engaged in savage price
discounting in desperation to secure any available orders, and we too have
been compelled to offer our products for sale at prices well below their
real value.'
He said that between 1990 and 1992 worldwide orders for regional aircraft
fell from 451 to 22 aircraft. Only 62 orders have been placed to date and
the majority of orders carried over from previous years have been cancelled.
There was a glut of used aircraft which could come back on to the market at
rock bottom prices, he said.
Mr MacDonald said that large-scale redundancies were either being
implemented or had been announced by aircraft manufacturers including Short
Brothers in Belfast, Fokker in the Netherlands, Deutsche Aerospace in
Germany and Embraer in Brazil.
Westland Aerospace on the Isle of Wight, which makes civil aircraft parts,
yesterday announced 81 job losses.
The company said airlines had reduced or delayed delivery of new aircraft,
resulting in a fall in production by manufacturers.

The transfer will involve 330 active Names. A further 900 inactive Names

STRIKING POSTAL workers in Cardiff will vote today on whether to end the
dispute which has disrupted mail in the Welsh capital for a fortnight.
Officials of the Union of Communication Workers yesterday told a meeting of
the 900 postal workers of a framework agreement which was negotiated last
week between the union and Royal Mail.
But the ballot on calling off the strike was postponed until today. The
ballot will carry a recommendation from both national and branch officials
to accept the agreement.
Mr Steve Bell, Cardiff branch secretary of the Union of Communication
Workers, said after yesterday's meeting: 'Branch officers believe that the
agreement represents a substantial concession - a victory for the workforce.
However, the workforce will make the final decision itself.
'Whatever the decision is, we have demonstrated that attempts by an
unaccountable management to impose antisocial working patterns upon the
Cardiff workforce have been defeated.'
Mr Alun Michael, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, yesterday called
for an independent inquiry into Royal Mail's management structure and style,
which he said had prolonged the dispute.
He said it was 'crazy' that the letter service in Cardiff was now managed
from a regional office in Gloucester.
'We have this remote control management which seems calculated to reduce
confidence both on the part of employees, with whom communication is of the
essence, and also with the public,' he said.
'Negotiations are always best left to the two sides but when it is the
business community and the public generally that are being damaged then we
have a right to say 'how are people running this outfit?'.'
Mr Graham Hall, chief executive of the Wales Chamber of Commerce, said last
night: 'There is an increasing feeling of frustration, particularly at the
way a settlement has been delayed.
'I am not sure people are aware of how serious it is. Everyone can identify
the cashflow problem - the money flow in Cardiff is drying up. But the
longer-term effect that people don't realise will be the lost orders because
inquiries have not been answered.'
It is expected to take at least a week for the backlog of 1m items of mail
to be cleared if the strike is called off today.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Staffing turnover in hotels declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL LABOUR turnover in the hotel and catering industry fell from 60 per
cent in the late 1980s to less than 30 per cent during the recession, says
the Employment Forecasts Update issued by Hotel and Catering Training
Company.
The sector, which expects to create a net 150,000 new jobs by the end of the
century, has a current annual turnover of about 640,000 people out of a
total of just over 2m. That means about 13,000 people must be recruited each
week to maintain employment levels.
Several other sectors have experienced a rapid fall in turnover during the
recession. A recent study by the Institute of Manpower Studies says turnover
has come close to zero in many companies. The institute warns that companies
should prepare for a rapid increase in turnover as the recovery continues.
The hotel and catering workforce is expected to regain its 1990 level of
2.5m by 1995. A net 72,000 jobs are forecast to be created each year between
1992 and 1995 and a further 24,000 jobs each year between 1995 and 2000.
The HCTC report predicts that restaurants and contract caterers will have
the highest rate of jobs growth, with employment in these sectors rising 17
per cent and 16 per cent respectively.

NEARLY 200 nurses at University College Hospital in London are to strike
today in protest against closure plans.
The nurses, members of Unison, the public services union, said they expected
to be supported in their action by ancillary workers and administrative
staff.
Nurses who are members of the Royal College of Nursing will not be taking
action.
The action follows a proposal by the Camden and Islington Health Authority
to withdraw its service contract from UCH and from the Middlesex Hospital,
where Unison is balloting its members on a one-day stoppage on Thursday.
Unison said the authority move would in effect close both hospitals.

THE Southern African Customs Union meets today in Swaziland to discuss its
future amid increasing indications that South Africa, the senior partner,
wishes to revise the terms of its participation.
Sacu - consisting of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho
 -has existed in various guises for more than 100 years, and has been the
most successful of the regional economic structures in southern Africa.
Domestic fiscal pressures, however, have led over the past year to vocal
protests in South African government circles that the system cannot continue
in its current form.
The root of the complaint is that while South Africa contributes 90 per cent
of all revenue to the customs pool, its share of receipts has declined to 44
per cent from 73 per cent a decade ago. In the case of countries like
Lesotho and Swaziland, these payments amount to more than a third of
national income. In the 1991/2 fiscal year, South Africa paid more than
R4.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) to other Sacu members, with about 40 per cent going
to the nominally independent homelands in South Africa.
According to Mr Gerhard Croeser, director general of the Department of
Finance, today's meeting is 'just to have an exchange of views, not to make
demands'. South Africa is too close to implementing new transitional
government arrangements for any big policy shifts. Although the discussions
will be technical in nature, they do have important ramifications,
particularly for the future of regional economic co-operation.
As Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said earlier this month, the
issue is not whether South Africa should be making the payments. 'All I am
saying is that you cannot justify the size of these payments in terms of the
Customs Union. If we were to include other potential members into this
arrangement, our system would run downhill at a rate which would be truly
alarming.'
If the Sacu formula is amended so as to make it possible for other countries
to join - and some have expressed interest - this would cast serious doubts
over the future of the Southern African Development Community as the premier
regional vehicle for economic integration.
The other main item up for discussion will be the terms of South Africa's
revised tariff offer to Gatt in the Uruguay Round. Due to be tabled by the
end of the month, it is likely to involve a cut in the number of tariff
lines from 12,000-plus to about 1,000, and a substantial cut in the average
level of protection. The issue will be how to reconcile South Africa's
tariff policy with the needs of other Sacu members, all of whose economies
are much less developed.

THE Export-Import Bank has promised to provide Boeing with Dollars 6.2bn in
financing to help the company in its drive to win a huge jet order from
Saudi Arabia, an Exim Bank official said, Reuter reports from Washington.
The bank said it was its biggest preliminary financing commitment, and could
involve a combination of direct loans and loans guarantees.
Saudia, Saudi Arabia's national carrier, is seeking to buy up to 80 US
airliners worth as much as Dollars 8bn.
It has been been courted by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie,
the Europe consortium made up of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France,
Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain.
The Exim Bank commitment would enable Boeing to match the financing terms
available to Airbus for its bid, the bank said.
Financing terms on such orders are governed by an agreement among industrial
nations under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
A spokeswoman for the bank described the potential order as a
'multi-aircraft transaction' with deliveries to the year 2000.
Exim Bank normally does not provide details on preliminary commitments, but
did so in this case with Boeing's approval.

ZIMMER of Frankfurt in Germany, a company in the Lurgi Group, itself an
engineering services subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, has signed a second
contract with China Petrochemical International (Sinopec) for the supply of
a further polyester plant, Our World Trade staff writes. The value of the
order amounts to more than DM50m (Pounds 19.4m).
The plant operator is to be Liaoyang Petrochemical Fibre, a subsidiary of
Sinopec. It will incorporate a two-line spinning facility designed for daily
production of 100 tonnes of staple fibre per line spun direct, using melt
polymer as feedstock.
Zimmer will supply the process technology, basic equipment and will
supervise building and start-up. The source of the polymer will be the
polyester polycondensation plant being supplied by Zimmer under a contract
awarded in 1992.
The polycondensation plant and the spinning plant will be built at the fibre
company's site 800 km north-east of Beijing. The two plants are due to be
commissioned in 1996.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: GrandMet wins approval for India drinks
venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK-based food, drinks and retailing group, is to
establish a joint venture in India to produce and market liquor for local
consumption and export.
The group announced yesterday that approval for the venture, which will
begin operations later this year, had been granted to International
Distillers and Vintners, its drinks division.
IDV will have a majority interest in the new company, International
Distillers India. Agreement had not yet been signed with its local, unnamed,
partner but negotiations were at 'an advanced stage', GrandMet said.
GrandMet has spent several years researching and planning the joint venture,
which will take advantage of recent liberalisation and economic reform by
the Indian government in a market worth Pounds 800m a year.
'In the light of the reforms, which are most encouraging, the way is now
clear to implement our investment plan for India,' said Mr John McGrath,
IDV's chief executive. 'It is a country of enormous potential both for IDV
brands and, subsequently, for the wide portfolio of GrandMet's branded
products.'
The venture will produce and market brands such as Smirnoff vodka, Gilbey's
gin, Malibu liqueur and Archer's schnapps.
A marketing and sales staff of between 50 and 70 people is expected to work
initially from regional offices in New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, and
Bangalore.
IDV has operated a company in neighbouring Sri Lanka since 1980, and has had
a production plant in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, since 1981.
United Distillers, the Guinness spirits company, recently announced a joint
venture in India with United Breweries, one of the country's largest drinks
producers.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: UK's very tangible benefits of invisibles
 -A 20% rise in the City of London's foreign earnings from financial
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGES of young men and women aggressively selling the pound on Black
Wednesday last September did little to endear the City of London to the
British public.
But the UK's financial centre may yet work its way back into the nation's
affections with the publication yesterday of detailed invisible earnings
figures.
These show that although City and other financial institutions did not earn
enough to offset the UK's considerable trade deficit last year, the deficit
on the current account would have been considerably worse without the
overseas earnings of the Square Mile.
According to British Invisibles, a trade group which promotes UK financial
and other services abroad, net overseas receipts of UK financial
institutions jumped 19.8 per cent last year from Pounds 15.7bn in 1991 to
Pounds 18.8bn.
The strong performance contributed to an overall invisibles surplus of
Pounds 4.8bn in 1992, compared with a surplus of Pounds 2.6bn in the
previous year.
With a visible, or merchandise, trade deficit of Pounds 13.4bn the overall
current account deficit in 1992 was Pounds 8.6bn, considerably lower than
had been expected. It compared with a deficit of Pounds 7.6bn in 1991 and
Pounds 18.3bn in 1990.
The improvement in invisible earnings was distributed fairly evenly across
the whole financial sector, with particularly strong overseas earnings by
pension funds, investment and unit trusts, insurance institutions and
dealers operating in the securities markets.
But although the figures are promising, the underlying performance of the
services and financial sectors was muddied last year by the devaluation of
sterling in September.
This boosted income earned in foreign currencies in the fourth quarter and
there was a corresponding sharp rise in portfolio earnings. Total income
from portfolio investment increased by 37.7 per cent last year to Pounds
10.6bn.
Within this, portfolio investment income for the banking sector rose by 19.2
per cent, reflecting a greater emphasis on investment in securities. Pension
fund income from portfolio investment rose to Pounds 2.2bn compared with
Pounds 1.56bn the previous year.
While welcome, the leap in earnings will only improve the UK's current
account position in the long term if the pound stays at its present level.
If not, the better invisibles surplus resulting from the devaluation will
prove transient.
Neither British Invisibles nor the Central Statistical Office was able to
say yesterday how much the improvement in overseas earnings from financial
institutions stemmed from the devaluation of sterling and how much was due
to an underlying improvement in the performance of the sector.
'The overall increase might have been exaggerated by special factors, but
there has unquestionably been some healthy growth underneath,' said Ms Jill
Leyland, who prepared the statistics for British Invisibles.
The figures showed that bank earnings from overseas increased by 10.3 per
cent last year to Pounds 8.7bn. British Invisibles said the good figures
were due in part to the reduced costs of the banks' overseas sterling
borrowing, but also the sharp rise in portfolio investment income.
Dealers operating in the securities markets earned a net Pounds 1.4bn last
year compared with Pounds 791m in 1990. Although this series is erratic, Ms
Leyland said the jump probably reflected the turmoil of the markets in
September last year.
Earnings for the insurance sector were the best for five years with net
overseas receipts jumping 21.6 per cent to Pounds 4.3bn compared with Pounds
3.5bn in 1991.
Mr Tony Baker of the Association of British Insurers said that while
devaluation had boosted earnings, particularly by inflating premiums from
North America, the rise also reflected a substantial increase in portfolio
investment income as a result of higher investment in overseas equities and
industrial bonds.
'These figures show the importance of the insurance sector to the UK
economy,' said Mr Baker. 'You have to ask where we would be without them,
especially when you look at the balance of trade figures.'
Net services income of the insurance sector was adversely affected by
continuing higher claims, widespread flooding in Europe last September and,
to a lesser extent, Hurricane Andrew in the US, British Invisibles said.

FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Japanese face rice shortfall
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S unseasonally wet summer could mean a rice shortage, necessitating
imports for the first time in 10 years, industry analysts said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
They forecast a shortfall of 50,000-250,000 tonnes and warn that Japan may
need to import that amount by the end of the year.
However, an Agriculture Ministry official in charge of state-controlled food
imports said there was no plan to import rice.
The analysts expect only about 250,000 tonnes to be rolled over from 1992
stocks, which in turn have been depleted by a series of typhoons.
Japan has not imported rice since the government allowed in 150,000 tonnes
of South Korean rice in 1984.
Tokyo bans commercial imports of rice to protect local farmers and to ensure
national self-sufficiency in the staple food. The government argues that
self-sufficiency is vital for national security and has rejected a Gatt
proposal to remove the barrier.
This has been one of the obstacles to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade talks, which started in 1986.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Iranian MPs crack whip at Rafsanjani
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PARICHEHRE MOSTESHAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ali Akbar Rafsanjani of Iran suffered the first serious defeat of
his career yesterday, when the Majlis (parliament) rejected the
re-appointment of Mr Mohsen Nourbakhsh, the economy and finance minister,
who had been entrusted to push through radical economic reforms,
However, Mr Rafsanjani immediately appointed Mr Nourbakhsh vice-president
for economic affairs, stressing in a decree read on television his 'valuable
experience in reforming the economic system and continuity of restructuring
policies'.
With earlier praise of Mr Nourbakhsh, who many blame for the continued
decline in the economy, the president made it clear during the endorsement
debate that his rejection would be a vote of no confidence in the
administration.
The present Majlis was elected on a ticket of economic reform to reverse the
damage done by the eight-year war with Iraq.
The new cabinet, first announced by Mr Rafsanjani nine days ago, was from
the start an exercise in compromise, mainly in response to pressure from
Ayatollah Khamenei, the country's spiritual leader, and to opposition from
the right-wing members of the Majlis.
Part of the paralysis in Iran since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini has been
because of the existence of too many power bases. President Rafsanjani spent
much of the last four years trying to consolidate his own authority.
The election of a more moderate Majlis last year was to have been the last
step, making it a two-sided power struggle between Mr Rafsanjani and the
spiritual leadership. Yesterday, however, it appeared to have become a
three-way game.
The survival of Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the oil minister, who received the
lowest vote of the 22 ministers endorsed by the Majlis, may have come as a
small consolation to Mr Rafsanjani. However, few leading Iranians have great
regard for Mr Aqazadeh who has presided over a ministry that is considered
moribund.
The rejection of Mr Nourbakhsh is a clear signal to the president that he
has done too little too late, and can no longer rely on the men he brought
into the Majlis in last year's elections. His failure to revitalise a jaded
cabinet team may have cost him the support he so badly needs to carry
through his ambitious programme of reforms.
The religious establishment, led by Ayatollah Khamenei, still blames the
pace of change for the riots in five large Iranian cities a year ago. The
removal of two hardliners, Hojatolislam Abdullah Nouri, the interior
minister, and Mostafa Mo'in, at culture and higher education, was a gesture
to the Majlis, but it was not enough.
President Rafsanjani had blamed the hardliners, who dominated the
post-revolution Majlis, for all the country's ills. Their removal was hoped
to leave the way clear for rapid modernisation, financed by foreign
investment.
The theory has not translated into practice. A year later the economy is
still in decline with a serious backlog of short-term debt.
This lack of progress has been put squarely at the door of the cabinet. The
new Majlis, elected on the slogan of 'support Rafsanjani', is now calling
for the blood of those surrounding the president.
Mr Rafsanjani did manage to resist the pressure from Ayatollah Khamenei to
elevate Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister, at the price of keeping
him in his present post.
The appointment of Ali Mohammed Besharati, a career diplomat allied to Mr
Rafsanjani, as interior minister, is a boost for or the president. It is the
first time, except for a brief interval in 1981, that a non-cleric has held
the post.
The departure of Hojatolislam Nouri from the interior ministry, leaves just
two clerics in the cabinet: Hojatolislams Ali Fallahian, at information, and
Mohammed Shoustari, at justice.
Mr Abdol-Hussein Vahhaji has also been removed from the ministry of
commerce. He was plagued by claims that senior personnel in his ministry had
received huge commissions on foreign dealings. He is replaced by Mr Yahya
Al-Ishagh.
The removal of Mr Ali Torkan from the ministry of defence came as a
surprise, as he appeared to enjoy the respect of all the armed forces.
However, the merging of the army and the Islamic Guard had caused tension.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Nigerian papers proscribed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government yesterday proscribed newspapers shut last
month, including one owned by Chief Moshood Abiola (above), victorious
candidate in the June presidential poll subsequently annulled by General
Ibrahim Babangida, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
'This is just the beginning of a new darkness of a type Nigerians never
believed they deserved,' said Mr Abiola in London yesterday. 'Babangida has
signalled to the world consent no longer forms any part of the code of
government.'
The decree outlaws newspapers of the Concord group, owned by Mr Abiola, and
those of Punch, the Daily Sketch and Bendel Newspaper Corporation, which the
government closed on July 22 in the biggest press clampdown since
independence in 1960, accusing the papers of bias.
General Babangida postponed a speech to the National Assembly yesterday, and
is expected to give details of his proposed interim government today, his
52nd birthday. Yesterday's press clampdown reinforced doubts that he will
hand effective power to the new administration.
Lagos re-opened for business yesterday after a three-day mass stay-at-home
protest, which left the city deserted from Thursday to Saturday. The
Campaign for Democracy, which organised the protest, has promised more
action.
Thousands of people are fleeing the cities, particularly in the south-west,
Mr Abiola's political strongold.
'As we get nearer the fateful August 27, the spate of flight has escalated,'
the Lagos Guardian newspaper said in an editorial.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Lebanese leaders review troop deployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANON'S leaders began top-level talks in Damascus yesterday after Syria
had voiced concern over the Beirut government's plans to deploy troops in
the south of the country, recently subjected to a week-long bombardment by
Israel.
The announcement of the troop deployment had been welcomed by Israel and the
US.
Both countries saw the move as an attempt by the Lebanese government to
control the activities of the Iranian-backed Hizbollah guerrillas.
It was the attacks by Hizbollah on Israeli troops occupying the southern
strip of Lebanon which sparked the furious Israeli response, forcing more
than 300,000 people from their homes and leaving at least 120 dead.
In the past two years the Lebanese army has collected most of the heavy
weapons of the militia forces, except those of Hizbollah, which is deemed to
be fighting a war of national liberation.
The initial announcement from Beirut that it was sending troops to the south
was seen as an attempt to extend its authority over a wider area of Lebanon.
However, in the face of Syrian opposition, only 300 troops have been sent
south and no further deployment is expected.
Syria, which maintains more than 30,000 of its own troops in Lebanon,
appears to have been alarmed that the movement of Lebanese forces would be
viewed as a diplomatic victory for Israel.
In a long interview with a Beirut newspaper, President Hafez al-Assad of
Syria stressed that it was his duty and that of the Beirut government to
strengthen the resistance and if necessary to protect it.
'Maybe at times we need to guide it, but only to increase its
effectiveness,' he said.
The seriousness of Syrian concern was underlined by the presence in Damascus
yesterday of the top three members of the Lebanese leadership, President
Elias Hrawi, Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the prime minister, and Mr Nabih Berri, the
speaker of the national assembly.
It is believed in Beirut that the Lebanese leaders, anxious to provide
security for villagers returning to the south, announced the deployment of
the army without consulting Syria, or perhaps taking fully into
consideration the wider interests of Damascus.
Syria has been accused by some Israeli and US leaders of using Hizbollah to
increase its leverage at the Middle East peace negotiations.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Beijing stumbles over 'good art': The problems of a new wave
of film-makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEN KAIGE, director of the acclaimed movie, Farewell To My Concubine, was
almost speechless with rage and frustration: 'How can I say anything? What
should I say? Should I say the government did the right thing? But that's
not the truth. Should I say the government did the wrong thing? If so, how
how could I stay on in China?'
'If you quote me directly it could land me in trouble,' he says, before
pausing and then adding: 'Well, if you really must quote me, say I don't
understand.'
Two weeks after the Chinese authorities withdrew permission to be shown
after just one viewing in Beijing for Mr Chen's film, which shared this
year's Palme d'Or at Cannes with Jane Campion's The Piano, it is difficult
to fathom where the decision leaves the new wave of Chinese film-makers and
writers; and whether, ominously, the ban heralds a new chill in official
attitudes towards art and literature.
Wang Shuo, the angry young man among Chinese writers whose books with their
earthy real-life dialogue are often subject to ferocious criticism in the
fusty official press, believes that a cooler breeze has been gusting through
artistic circles for the past several months.
'We could feel the chill since the spring,' he says. 'It's a definite
trend.' As for the decision to ban Farewell To My Concubine, it was 'stupid
and poisonous', he adds.
Other writers, such as playwright Guo Shixin, take a more phlegmatic view,
and believe that problems over Farewell To My Concubine are peculiar to the
film itself, and do not necessarily reflect a trend. 'The biggest obstacle
now is writers' self-censorship,' he says. 'After decades of political
pressure, they tend to put limits on themselves automatically.'
Whatever the truth, there is no doubt the row over Chen Kaige's film, with
its poignant scenes from China's recent turbulent Cultural Revolution past
and its implied criticism of the Communist party, has come as a sharp
reminder of limits on literary and artistic endeavour, even as Beijing
continues to proclaim its commitment to an opening to the outside world.
The difficulty facing the authorities in judging what is and what is not
acceptable in their terms, was reflected in arguments put forward by Mr Liu
Zhongde, the culture minister, in a recent People's Daily article, in which
he sought to define what was appropriate in the new market economy. It was a
prescription from China's leading cultural commissar that would hardly have
engendered much confidence among artists and writers in the government's
commitment to literary and artistic freedom.
'At a time when popular art is rapidly developing, we must use the law to
stop 'garbage art' from running rampant,' said Mr Liu. 'We should also
reward artists who make 'good' art and punish those who create 'crass'
works.'
It is not clear where Farewell to My Concubine falls between these
categories since the authorities have not said publicly why they object to
the film, although it is widely assumed that China's party elders found
distasteful a homosexual scene and a downbeat ending in the which one of the
leading characters commits suicide.
Themes of despair and hopelessness are not deemed be appropriate in modern
post-Cultural Revolution China, marching as it is towards a glorious new
dawn under the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Mr Chen, meanwhile, awaits the verdict of the censor, who had already
chopped about 50 feet out of the film before its one and only showing in
Beijing. He insists he will not co-operate in changing the ending.
'If they want to do it, fine,' he said recently. 'But there is no more
footage with which to make the change. It will be a film without an ending.'
The Farewell To My Concubine saga is unlikely to fade soon, happy ending or
no happy ending, nor is there likely to be truce between China's new breed
of avant garde film makers and the authorities, now that these talented
directors and producers have discovered a means to make their films using
private donations and equipment without having to rely on the state. They
have also tapped a receptive and encouraging international audience.
Underground film-maker Zhang Yuan, for example, was able recently to defy
official attempts to prevent him taking his radical work, Beijing Bastards,
to the Locarno film festival in Switzerland. China had asked the organisers
to withdraw the film, which depicts the seamy side of life in the Chinese
capital, and features China's reigning rock idol, Cui Jian.
Other works that have been attracting attention recently, include Wu
Wenguang's 1966, My Time in the Red Guard, and Bumming in Beijing - The Last
Dreamers. Films like these, made on a shoestring, will not be released
officially for the time being, since the state controls all means of
distribution, but they are being shown to smaller, private audiences, and
are helping to attract a following for their authors, and perhaps more
important, financial support.
Independent directors such as Zhang and Wu might also draw comfort from the
example of Zhang Yimou, whose Raise the Red Lantern was initially not
allowed to be shown in China. The authorities eventually relented late last
year after it had won widespread international acclaim.
Chen Kaige, who has graduated from low-budget films to works such as
Farewell To My Concubine which cost several million dollars to make, is
obliged to tread carefully these days since he requires official Chinese
approval for his next venture. . . if it is to be shot and shown on the
mainland.
Chen is also being obliged to shelve for the moment plans to make a film
about Nien Cheng's harrowing novel, Life and Death in Shanghai. This could
hardly have avoided negative reference to the Communist party and taboo
subjects such as Mao himself.
Instead, Chen is embarking on the safer Shadow of a Flower, a love story set
in 1930s Shanghai. China's cultural commissars should be able to live with
that.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Kuomintang rift poses threat to hold on power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHALLENGE to President Lee Teng-hui's leadership of the ruling Kuomintang
Nationalist Party has widened internal divisions which pose a growing threat
to the party's 44-year hold on power in Taiwan.
Delegates to the KMT's 14th congress, which opened yesterday, said that they
were seeking sufficient signatures to nominate a rebel candidate - Mr Chang
Feng-shu, 65, a former minister of state and mayor of Taipei  - in
tomorrow's elections for the party chairmanship.
Mr Lee is expected to retain the post. But the dissidents' move underlined
growing anger within the party at the slow pace of democratic reform and of
measures against corruption. In last December's parliamentary election, the
KMT's share of the vote fell to a record low partly because of popular
disquiet about corruption.
Unrest within the party was highlighted last week when six prominent members
of parliament broke away to form the New Party, saying the KMT had become
corrupt and paid too much attention to interests of wealthy businessmen.
Mr Lee acknowledged yesterday that the party was threatened by internal
factional struggles and growing political opposition.
'In recent years, pluralism in society has led to differences in political
ideology among our comrades, posing a severe challenge to us in elections,'
he told the congress.
'Implementing internal reform is more difficult than tackling external
challenges. But our goal has been set and we must overcome all obstacles,'
Mr Lee said.
The congress is expected to drop most of the 12 'mainlanders' - veterans who
fled to Taiwan with General Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 when the Communists took
power in China - from the 31-member Central Standing Committee. This will
virtually complete the transfer of power from the veterans to local-born
politicians such as Mr Lee.
The internal travails are partly a reflection of this transfer, as Taiwanese
people take an increasingly pragmatic view about relations with China. The
New Party is advocating direct transport links.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Hopes rise over Hong Kong talks
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and Britain yesterday expressed hope that progress in negotiations
over Hong Kong's future could be achieved in time for a scheduled meeting
later in September between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Mr
Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator, told reporters. He said there would
be several more rounds of negotiations before the end of September and 'we
hope that more progress will be made in these rounds of talks'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and his Chinese counterpart,
Mr Qian Qichen met in Beijing in July in an attempt to break the impasse on
the Hong Kong issue.
They agreed then to meet again at the United Nations General Assembly in New
York.
China has been deeply angered by plans advanced by Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, to broaden the franchise for elections due in 1994 and
1995. Beijing says this plan contradicts understandings reaching with London
on the transition to Chinese rule in 1997.
Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's chief negotiator, declined yesterday to provide
details about progress in the talks, but he did say: 'We have a lot of work
to do, and we have been getting on with it.'

<TEXT>
JAPANESE investment in Australia is shrinking, Australia's foreign affairs
and trade department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Canberra.
'While lower Japanese investment in Australia is part of a global slowdown
in Japanese long-term capital outflow, the contraction has been much more
severe in Australia than elsewhere,' the department said in its latest
Quarterly Economic and Trade Review.
In 1989/1990, Japan's share of foreign investment in Australia was larger
than that of any other country. Now Japan was the third largest investor in
the country behind Britain and the US, the report said.
Japanese investors had withdrawn more than ADollars 4bn (Pounds 1.82bn) in
investments in Australia in the six months to March 1993. Weakness in the
Australian dollar may have contributed to the drop in Japanese interest.
Weak global commodity prices may also have contributed by damping investment
in Australian mining, the report added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has cracked down on the spread of golf courses and race courses as
part of a nationwide campaign against frivolous real estate development,
writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
A circular from the State Council (cabinet) said there would be 'no
approval, no licence, no land and no loans for such expensive projects as
horse race tracks and golf courses'.
China's cabinet last year reiterated a ban on gambling, but a number of
Chinese businessmen had pushed ahead with race course construction in the
hope of getting the ban lifted.
The Chinese authorities, in their efforts to regain control of a runaway
economy, have targeted real estate speculation as a leading cause of a
credit binge, which was draining funds from much-needed infrastructure
projects such as roads and railways.
'For buildings with limited market potential, such as villas, holiday
villages, luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings, the country will
place strict limits on this area, and halt the construction of some
buildings already in progress,' the circular said.
Mr Deng Chenbo, who has been attempting to introduce horse-racing to the
Chinese capital, said he was sure racing would be allowed to go ahead in
China 'in due course'. Mr Deng blamed 'muddle-headed' figures in the Chinese
leadership for the continued ban on racing. 'They should know that golf
courses and race courses will bring them not only a lot of tax money, but
also make the people happy,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is growing at a modest pace, figures indicated yesterday,
writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The Federal Reserve said industrial
production rose 0.4 per cent last month and 3.5 per cent in the year to
July, more than recouping small declines in output in May and June.
The figures - consistent with forecasts of accelerated economic growth in
the current quarter, after a disappointing 1.6 per cent annual growth rate
between April and June - indicate that factory production is beginning to
expand in response to rising consumer demand.
Last month's rebound was broadly based and would have been stronger but for
a further modest decline in car and truck output. The consumer goods,
business equipment and construction sectors all registered production
increases after previous declines. Output of utilities rose sharply as
unusually hot weather led to a surge in electricity consumption.
Manufacturing output rose by 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.8 per cent in
the year to July.
The level of industrial capacity utilisation rose slightly to 81.5 per cent,
the average level in the first half. This is less than half a percentage
point below the long-term average, suggesting that rapid increases in
production would put upward pressure on prices.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Clinton comes out fighting on healthcare: President defends
plan for employer-funded insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday started his campaign for sweeping reform of
the US healthcare system with a strong defence of the need for employers to
provide health insurance for workers.
Mr Clinton told a meeting of state governors that a mandate stipulating
employers provide insurance was the only fair way of making sure everyone
received medical coverage.
The employer mandate is expected to be one of the most controversial
elements in the healthcare debate. It is hotly opposed by small businesses
and by many Republicans, who believe it will force companies to lay off
workers to avoid additional costs.
Although the health reform plan will not be formally presented until next
month, Mr Clinton outlined a number of principles.
The plan must provide medical security not only to those who now have no
insurance, but also to those who are afraid of losing coverage. It should
build on the 'managed care' concept, maintaining the private-sector health
insurance industry but setting up alliances in each state to negotiate for
cheaper healthcare and providing new incentives for preventive medicine.
Mr Clinton also backed insurance reform, massive cuts in paperwork,
increases in medical research budgets and an effort to include the workers'
compensation system, which covers job-related injuries and illnesses.
One significant proposal would be for the cost of health insurance policies
for the self-employed to be 100 per cent tax deductible, instead of 25 per
cent as at present.
But Mr Clinton's strongest appeal was over the employer mandate.
Mr Ira Magaziner, the president's principal healthcare adviser, said
afterwards that an employer mandate would be phased in over five to seven
years.
Employers would be required to pay 80 per cent of the insurance premiums,
but their total cost would be capped at a percentage of their payroll -
probably 3.5 per cent for small businesses and 7-7.5 per cent for large
companies.
Mr Clinton said both employers and employees needed to take more
responsibility for the cost of healthcare. 'Every American should know that
healthcare is not something financed by the tooth fairy,' he said. He also
warned it would not be easy to win passage for healthcare reform
legislation, and criticised the politics of Washington.
'Back east, where I work, consensus is often turned into cave-in. People who
try to work together and listen to one another, instead of beat each other
up, are accused of being weak, not strong,' Mr Clinton complained.
'The people that really score are the people that lay one good lick on you
in the newspaper every day instead of the people that get up and go to
work.'

MR Juan Carlos Wasmosy became Paraguay's first-ever democratically elected
civilian president on Sunday, when outgoing President Andres Rodrguez
surrendered power as scheduled four years after toppling Gen Alfredo
Stroessner in a bloody coup.
But Mr Wasmosy, a politically inexperienced construction millionaire,
promised no sudden break with the country's past, overshadowed for 35 years
by Gen Stroessner.
In his inauguration speech Mr Wasmosy called for 'dialogue, tolerance and
unity' and promised to continue the previous government's policies of
political and economic liberalisation.
Mr Wasmosy, 54, named a 10-member cabinet of politicians and bureaucrats who
served first under Gen Stroessner and then under Mr Rodrguez. During his
four-year term as president, Mr Rodrguez is credited with bringing unheard
of democratic freedoms to Paraguay while reforming its closed and backward
economy.
Mr Wasmosy's narrow election victory in May, when he won 40 per cent of the
votes, ensures that the dominant Colorado party maintains its 60-year grip
on power, but it no longer holds exclusive control over government. Two
opposition parties now dominate Congress, forcing Mr Wasmosy to begin
negotiations with political leaders on a 'governability pact'.
At the same time, the new president needs to preserve good relations with
the armed forces, which retain great political influence in Paraguay. He is
not expected to investigate aggressively corruption scandals involving top
army officers that came to light during the final year of Gen Rodrguez's
government.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Greenhouse gas deadline missed
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, GENEVA
</DATELINE>

THE US administration has missed its self-imposed deadline for producing a
plan to curb emissions of gases that contribute to global warming.
Instead of completing the plan in time for the two-week international global
warming conference which began in Geneva yesterday, White House officials
acknowledged they would probably not be ready before the end of next month.
The delay means the US has missed an opportunity to provide leadership on
the issue at the intergovernmental meeting, and has drawn criticism from
some environmental groups.
'Continued delay of the US climate action plan will send the wrong message
to the world,' said Mr Bill Eichbaum, of the Worldwide Fund for Nature.
Under the climate change convention agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro last year, countries will be required to come up with action plans
to restrain their emissions of warming gases - principally carbon dioxide,
chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides - to their 1990 level by the
year 2000.
The US is the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, with an estimated
5.2bn tons emitted in 1990. Emissions are projected to grow by 125m-200m
tons this decade.
The task of devising a plan to curb US emissions has been complicated by the
Clinton administration's failure to persuade Congress to agree a significant
energy tax.
Issues for discussion at the Geneva meeting include a common measurement
standard and how to account for joint projects by two or more countries.
Officials will also discuss 'joint implementation' - the extent to which a
country can claim credit against its own emissions target for financing
projects in another country which can achieve the same overall effect more
cheaply.
Funding for developing country projects is another contentious issue. While
up to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) may be available over the next three years
through the Global Environment Facility run jointly by the UN and the World
Bank, it has yet to be decided which countries should benefit and what types
of project should qualify.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Blue-eyed sheikhs get used to life without oil wealth:
Albertans no longer have savings for a rainy day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERTA'S 2.6m residents were led to believe for almost two decades that
their oil and gas wealth provided a cushion against hard times.
When energy prices soared in the mid-1970s, the Canadian prairie province
decided to squirrel away 15 per cent of its oil and gas royalties in a
newly-created Heritage Savings Trust Fund. By the early 1980s, the fund had
amassed assets of over CDollars 12bn (Pounds 6.2bn), and was investing in
income-producing ventures as well as improvements to the province's
infrastructure.
But Albertans, once labelled the blue-eyed sheikhs, have discovered lately
that oil and gas cannot protect them from free-spending politicians or the
realities of the business cycle.
Having posted a budget deficit for eight years in a row, the province has
run up an accumulated debt of more than CDollars 11bn (including unfunded
pension liabilities).
A non-partisan commission, appointed by the government to examine Alberta's
fiscal hangover, concluded earlier this year that 'we have effectively used
up all the savings of the Heritage Fund and more . . . These funds are no
longer available for a rainy day.' Such sober assessments have led Albertans
to take a new look both at their past and their future. They are
questioning, as seldom before, whether they could have spent their oil
wealth more wisely.
At the same time, a new provincial government led by Mr Ralph Klein, a
former TV reporter and mayor of Calgary, has promised a new era of rigorous
fiscal discipline.
The treasurer, Mr Jim Dinning, said in this year's budget speech that
'optimistic oil and gas revenue forecasts have no place in the budgetary
exercise. In future, we'd rather err on the other side.' The latest budget
is predicated on average energy revenues over the past five years.
Mr Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers in Calgary, estimates that royalties, income taxes and other
levies paid by the energy industry make up at least 40 per cent of
provincial government revenues.
Oil and gas have brought indisputable benefits to Alberta. Alone among
Canada's 10 provinces, it has no retail sales tax. Personal income tax rates
are the lowest in the country.
Mr Peter Lougheed, the provincial premier from 1971 to 1985, says that his
policy was to spend heavily on capital projects with the aim of building a
modern infrastructure which could last for decades with minimum expansion.
He ticks off an impressive list, including a network of 124 hospitals (more
than three-quarters of them in rural areas); a modern highway system;
libraries; two well-equipped technical colleges; an extensive tourism area
in the Rockies foothills; and a CDollars 300m medical research foundation
financed by the Heritage Fund.
The politicians seemed not to notice when the bottom fell out of the oil
price in 1985/86. Oil and gas royalties, which averaged CDollars 4.8bn a
year between 1981 and 1986, sank to an average of CDollars 2.3bn between
1988 and 1993.
Neither the quantity nor the quality of spending took account of this
deterioration. 'Each little department of government was a fiefdom which did
its own thing,' says Mr George Cornish, retired city commissioner of Calgary
who is now executive-in-residence at the local university's faculty of
management.
In the second half of the 1980s, the emphasis shifted to diversification.
Japanese and other investors built several wood-pulp mills with support from
provincial coffers. A US-Canadian consortium put up a magnesium smelter with
the help of CDollars 103m in government loan guarantees.
The government nurtured and took an equity stake in NovAtel, one of North
America's biggest cellular telephone makers.
The success rate of these investments would make a banker blush. The
province has already written off about 17 per cent of the CDollars 12.2bn in
loans and guarantees which it advanced in the cause of diversification.
NovAtel has disappeared. The magnesium smelter, which used an untried
technology, has been mothballed.
One source estimates that another CDollars 1bn-CDollars 2bn in writedowns
are unavoidable over the next few years. In particular, the government is
unlikely to realise its investment in Gainers, a troubled meat processing
company. A heavy oil upgrader on the Saskatchewan border, which was built
with almost CDollars 300m of taxpayers' money, is also in the red.
This poor fiscal management was largely blamed on the patronage, cronyism
and lack of co-ordination which flourished under Mr Donald Getty, who
succeeded Mr Lougheed as premier.
Mr Getty quit politics earlier this year. His successor, Mr Klein, has
served notice that Albertans can no longer expect their government to keep
spending in the hope that energy prices will climb.
A Deficit Elimination Act, passed last spring, requires that the budget be
balanced again within four years. The government has promised that, in the
words of a budget document, 'there will be no loopholes'.
The oil-boom largesse is being scaled back. The provincial health department
is considering closing several of the hospitals built in the good years. Mr
Klein has promised to end direct subsidies to business. In one small but
controversial move, the government has stopped paying daily allowances to
prisoners in provincial jails.
Mr Protti says the mood among oil and gas producers has also changed. The
industry is 'no longer a high-flying play based on commodity prices. Today,
the attitude is very much that if you can't make money at Dollars 18 a
barrel, you had better make the changes required to make money, otherwise
you're going out of business.'
Even the Heritage Fund is not expected to survive the new climate of
austerity. The fund stopped growing a decade ago when its investment income
was funnelled into general revenues. The book value of its assets is now
less than half the size of the provincial debt.
The Financial Review Commission proposed that the fund be abolished as a
separate entity. After a period of public consultation, the government is
expected to concur.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Rexrodt puts coal subsidies on hit-list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, yesterday took aim at
monopolies and highly subsidised industries such as coal by calling for
faster privatisation and greater competition.
He said no sector would be spared in his campaign for greater flexibility
and competitiveness in the economy. A key element would be the reduction of
subsidies in all sectors over the next five years and the privatisation of a
broad range of state companies.
In a hard-hitting paper presented to his Free Democratic Party (FDP), the
junior partner in the Bonn coalition, Mr Rexrodt said the politically
sensitive coal industry should be included in the reforms.
Direct federal subsidies to the western states, excluding federal tax
concessions and soft loans, totalled DM13.5bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in 1992, or 1.3
per cent of gross domestic product. Nearly half the subsidies have been
earmarked for supporting agriculture and the coal industry, the latter
accounting for 19 per cent of western Germany's total energy consumption. In
1990, coal mining subsidies amounted to DM80,500 per employee, or 1.8 times
the average yearly income of a blue-collar worker.
A reform of the coal industry would be particularly welcomed by western
German consumers. The sector's price structure was mapped out in a 1980
agreement between the coal and electricity industries. The agreement
stipulated the amount of domestic coal the utilities undertook to burn for
the remainder of the century.
But because of high production costs, the electricity companies pay about
DM280 per ton, compared with world prices of DM80. To compensate for the
high cost of coal, the electricity utilities collect the Kohlepfennig, a
levy from the consumer. This explains why German electricity is among the
most expensive in the European Community.
The FDP paper was jointly put forward with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign
minister and head of the party.
An FDP spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt wanted to present the paper on creating
more competition when parliament resumes after the summer recess.
By singling out reductions in subsidies and the faster privatisation or
deregulation of the public sector  - including Deutsche Telekom, the
national telecommunications company, and Lufthansa, the state airline -
economists said that Mr Rexrodt was challenging structures which helped
maintain high costs for the consumer, as well as wage levels.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Italy's offer of beds boosts Bosnian airlift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday became the latest country to join the international scramble
to evacuate the wounded war victims of Sarajevo when it offered to provide
454 hospital beds for the seriously injured patients  - the largest offer to
date.
But as the diplomatic wrangling continued over the airlifts, which some UN
officials have criticised as a publicity stunt, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicated that it now had more offers of
beds than it had patients awaiting evacuation.
More than 700 beds have now been offered by more than a dozen governments in
recent days, including Britain, Ireland, France, Jordan, Turkey, Finland,
Kuwait and the US, following the emotional press coverage of the case of
Irma Hadzimuratovic, a five-year-old mortar victim from Sarajevo.
Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the UNHCR, yesterday welcomed the flood of
offers, which she said marked a turnabout in attitudes, after 16 months of
indifference from western countries.
She said thousands of offers from individuals and private clinics were also
pouring in, which the International Office for Migration (IOM), an
inter-governmental agency, would follow up due to lack of staff at the
UNHCR.
However, Mr Manuel de Almeida, UNHCR spokesman in Zagreb, stressed that more
aid was needed across the former Yugoslavia.
Until last week, the UNHCR staff had only been identifying some 25 patients
a week for evacuation in Sarajevo, he said. However, there were others lying
injured at home in the city, which the UNHCR staff - who are already badly
overstretched - have not yet had the resources to identify.
He said 15 countries had now offered hospital places, including Italy,
Finland, the Czech republic, Jordan, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland,
the US, Canada and Turkey.
Amid charges that the media - and humanitarian campaign - had focused too
narrowly on Sarajevo, the UNHCR yesterday said that it hoped to extend the
operation across Bosnia, although renewed fighting in central Bosnia was
still making conditions dangerous.
Meanwhile, the British government yesterday came under fresh fire over its
evacuation of 21 injured from Sarajevo on Sunday after the Swedish foreign
minister claimed that the British government's questioning of the choice of
victims had delayed Sunday's airlift. British foreign office officials
yesterday denied the allegation, and insisted that, in spite of media
allegations that some soldiers had bribed their way onto the airlift, the
British government 'had met all the objectives' of the operation.
In an effort to deflect the critical publicity over the affair, the British
government noted that it had been the largest single donor to the former
Yugoslavia, having given Pounds 131m in aid in the past 14 months.
However, it said it had no plans to conduct further airlifts at the moment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc remained weak on foreign exchange markets yesterday, amid
investor fears that the Bank of France would keep interest rates high and
that the French government was considering imposing limits on capital
movements.
The franc fell almost a centime against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.5440. It
has lost more than 10 centimes against the German currency since the franc
was effectively floated at the beginning of the month after the European
currency crisis. Most currency analysts said they expected the franc would
fall to about FFr3.60 to the D-Mark over coming weeks as the Bank of France
maintained high interest rates to help rebuild its reserves.
'The markets are impatient for interest rate cuts,' said one economist in
London. 'They believe that maintaining high borrowing rates will prolong the
recession in France and further damage investor sentiment.'
Investors also expressed anxiety about hints from the French government that
it wants to impose capital controls as a means of protecting the franc. Last
week prime minister Edouard Balladur said that France would not tolerate a
situation where speculators could threaten economic security and that he was
considering ways to curb speculation.
Economists stressed the difficulties involved in such a move. 'It is
unlikely at the unilateral level and it would be hard to get agreement at an
EC level for such a move,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at
Salomon Brothers. He argues that limits on capital movements would drive
capital from France, weakening the franc and putting upward pressure on
interest rates.

A member of Bosnia's presidency, Ejup Ganic, yesterday asked for the removal
of a UN military spokesman in Sarajevo after he repeatedly declined to use
the word 'siege' to describe Bosnian Serb forces' grip on the city, Reuter
reports from Sarajevo.
Commander Barry Frewer, a Canadian who is the press spokesman in Sarajevo
for the UN Protection Force, used the less emotive term 'encirclement' in a
press briefing.
His remarks prompted four relief agencies working in the Bosnian capital to
say conditions remained desperate and accuse the UN of playing politics by
suggesting the siege was over.

MR Ion Iliescu, Romania's president, last night began talks with trade union

deadlock in the country's rail strike which began a week ago, writes
Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Opposition parties asked the president to mediate between the two sides,
warning of the grave dangers the conflict posed to an already tense country.
The all-out strike, considered Romania's most serious post-communist labour
conflict, has blocked all main railway stations as well as international
traffic through the Balkans. Among the few services running yesterday were a
handful of trains bringing children back from their summer holidays.
Government officials also met to analyse the effects of the strike and
consider emergency action after state enterprises, including two large steel
mills, said they had begun to run short of raw materials.

FT  17 AUG 93 / EC interest rates puzzle: Why Germany pushed at an open door
on monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reluctance of Germany's partners in the European exchange rate mechanism
to cut their interest rates has caused considerable puzzlement in the two
weeks since currency speculation forced the ERM countries to adopt 15 per
cent fluctuation margins.
Part of the answer appears to be that Germany specifically asked other ERM
countries not to push interest rates down precipitately after agreeing the
changes in the ERM at the August 1-2 crisis meeting of EC finance ministers
and central bank governors in Brussels.
Hitherto unreported details of that meeting may also provide clues as to how
European Community countries will frame their international monetary
policies in the months ahead. In particular:
Britain, in the person of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, spoke in favour of retaining the ERM, rather than seeing the
European Community adopt a generalised floating of currencies.
Belgium came nearest to supporting exchange controls to combat speculation.
Germany appears to have ruled out any 'fast track' monetary union with
France ahead of the Maastricht Treaty schedule for Emu.
According to European monetary officials, it was at the end of the bruising
negotiations over the future of the ERM that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank vice-president and president-designate, 'recommended' that other
ERM countries should exercise caution in cutting interest rates once they
had agreed to wider fluctuation bands.
Some of those present in the early hours of Monday August 2 expected the
other members of the ERM would pay little attention to his call. The move
appeared designed to shield the Bundesbank from pressure to cut its own
rates sharply and so undermine its counter-inflation programme.
But it turned out that Germany was pushing on an open door. Except for
Spain, all the ERM countries have proved reluctant to cut their interest
rates. France, which earlier this year had been anxious to push short-term
rates below German levels, has responded with only two small cuts in the
past two weeks.
The decision to keep the Dutch guilder within its old 2.25 per cent
fluctuation margins against the D-Mark seems to have dissuaded other ERM
countries from embarking on competitive devaluation within the ERM.
France appears also to have opted to keep interest rates high for the time
being to rebuild its currency reserves and maintain the prestige of Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who earlier had threatened to resign
rather than see the franc devalued.
Germany may also have benefited from its display of strength in the early
August crisis meeting, which came close to collapse when it was proposed
that the D-Mark and guilder should be floated off from the rest of the ERM.
Belgium insisted that it should stay within the old 2.25 per cent band
against the D-Mark. It proposed that the Belgian franc should be supported
by large-scale intervention and through the imposition of 100 per cent
minimum reserve requirements to deter speculation. This suggestion, which
would be equivalent to the imposition of exchange controls, was rejected by
the other countries with the result that the meeting began to consider the
option of a generalised float for the ERM currencies.
Some officials believe that at this point the German delegation came under
intense pressure from the office of Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor,
not to accept a generalised floating. Bonn received support from an unlikely
quarter.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, who had played a very small part in
the talks, sided with Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC commissioner for
monetary affairs, in saying that a generalised float was a bad solution.
Shortly after this, the meeting agreed to 15 per cent fluctuation margins.
Although the UK had not participated in the ERM since the previous
September, Mr Clarke was unwilling to see a free-for-all among European
currencies that would undermine the competitiveness of UK exports to the
rest of the EC. The UK also took the view that a generalised float would
jeopardise the EC single market and threaten the monetary arrangements under
the common agricultural policy while the existence of the ERM had eased the
management of sterling as a floating currency over the previous 10 months.
Mr Clarke's stance may earn him little support among the Eurosceptics of the
British Conservative party.
But they can probably take comfort from Germany's clear rejection of a 'fast
track' move to monetary union with France.
When this idea was put forward by a Portuguese delegate as one way out of
the crisis, it was dismissed as a 'joke' by Mr Gert Haller, the state
secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry.

CAPACITY utilisation in western German industry has stabilised after more
than two years of decline, the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute
reported yesterday.
Manufacturing and mining equipment, excluding food and drink, was working at
78.3 per cent of capacity during June, barely changed from 78.6 per cent in
March.
The average volume of outstanding orders, sufficient for 2.5 months, was
also unchanged over the three-month period. The figures add weight to other
recent evidence that the recession may have reached its low point.
However, most of the companies surveyed suggested utilisation rates would
remain unsatisfactory at least for the next 12 months.
They are still well below the 10-year average rate of around 85 per cent,
and the peak of almost 90 per cent recorded in the third quarter of 1990.
The Ifo survey showed that conditions in some important industrial sectors
were continuing to deteriorate. Utilisation rates among investment goods
makers were 75.7 per cent in June compared with 76.6 per cent three months
earlier. The figures for consumer non-durables makers also fell from 85.9
per cent to 84 per cent.

ETHNIC Hungarians in southern Slovakia, who blocked traffic last week in
protest over a ban on bilingual road signs, erected signs on Monday with
large question marks replacing the name of their village, Reuter reports
from Bratislava.
Villagers in Marcelova replaced signs bearing its Hungarian name,
Marcelhaza, with signs featuring giant question marks 'as another form of
protest', Mr Laszlo Sooky, the Marcelova mayor, said.
The dispute is the latest in a string of minority rights squabbles between
Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians, numbering about 600,000, and the Slovak
government.
The villagers are angry at a government order giving towns until the end of
July to take down bilingual road signs.
Mr Sooky said the question- marks would remain until parliament reconvened
in September and debated the issue.
Last month, the Slovak cabinet approve a bill legalising the official use of
Hungarian first and family names.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Kiev moves to resolve its nuclear limbo: Fears grow that
Ukraine will soon be able to fire the weapons on its territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and other western countries are watching Ukraine anxiously to see
whether Russia's sister Slav state will soon be a formidable nuclear power.
Ukraine inhabits a sort of nuclear limbo. Such a large chunk of the former
Soviet nuclear arsenal - 1,656 nuclear war-heads - is stationed on Ukrainian
territory that if Kiev were to develop operational control over all of them
it would be the third most powerful nuclear nation behind the US and Russia.
Western fears - and Russian ones - grew last month, when the Ukrainian
parliament declared that independent Ukraine owned all the nuclear weapons
stationed on its territory.
However, as General Pavel Grachev, the Russian minister of defence pointed
out last week, all nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine are under the
operational control of Russia.
The question troubling western foreign ministries is: should Ukraine want
'operational control' over those weapons (meaning the ability to fire them),
how easy would it be for Kiev to develop it?
The Ukrainian parliament has hesitated over ratifying international
disarmament treaties which would commit Ukraine to becoming a non-nuclear
state. President Leonid Kravchuk has said that he favours a compromise
agreement in which Ukraine would pledge eventually to become a non-nuclear
power but would temporarily keep some Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles
on its territory.
'The Ukrainians are hedging their bets on the nuclear question because they
want some time in which they can keep their eyes on the Russians,' says Mr
Bruce Blair, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and one of the
leading American experts on Soviet nuclear weapons.
Ukrainian scientists, engineers and military men played a crucial role in
the building of the former Soviet Union's vast nuclear arsenal, and
according to Mr Blair, there is no doubt that if they put their minds to it,
they could develop independent nuclear capacity.
Mr Markian Bilinsky, a British academic working at a Ukrainian research
institute, goes further. 'The Ukrainians are moving closer to obtaining
operational control. I cannot believe that there is not some institute in
Ukraine which is working on breaking the codes for the missiles,' he says.
This spring, American and Russian intelligence sources leaked their fears
that Ukraine had begun to try to develop control over the 1,656 strategic
nuclear weapons currently under Russian control, but located on Ukrainian
territory. Their worries centred on the factory in the eastern Ukrainian
city of Kharkov.
This closely guarded enterprise, which officially bears the innocuous title
TS Shevchenko Factory in honour of Ukraine's national poet, is one of only
two plants in the former Soviet Union which manufactured blocking devices
for ICBMs.
Ukraine has a legitimate reason for building blocking devices of its own:
Moscow's breach of its promise to provide Kiev with technical 'negative
control' - the physical ability to veto the use of the nuclear weapons on
its territory.
However, as Mr Blair explained in testimony before a Senate committee, 'the
devices unfortunately do more than just block unauthorised launches; they
are also integral to the launch process. If Ukraine replaced the current
devices with their own they would be able to activate the flight plans on
the missiles and fire them.'
However, any tampering with the weapons would be immediately detected by
Moscow. Russian Strategic Rocket Force commanders could then respond in a
number of ways, ranging from employing various built-in safety devices which
would temporarily de-activate the missiles, to a pre-emptive military
strike.
The missiles most suited to Ukraine's defence needs are the 130 SS-19s
stationed in Ukraine. The SS-19s have been routinely tested at a little more
than 600 miles, their minimum distance, and, as it happens, the distance
between Ukrainian airfields and Moscow.
Moreover, as Mr Yakov Eisenberg, director of the Khartron weapons systems
factory in eastern Ukraine proudly confirms, the guidance system for the
SS-19s were entirely designed and are maintained by his scientists.
However, acquiring control over the SS-19s could be of dubious value for
Ukraine because 18 months ago Russia stopped maintaining the tritium in
their war-heads. Mr Blair reckons that some of the missiles could be as much
as three years overdue for maintenance and, consequently, might not go off
if they were fired.
In addition to the SS-19s, there are 46 SS-24s located on Ukrainian
territory. However, controlling the SS-24s, whose shortest range in test
history is 1,700 miles, would not enable Ukraine to threaten European
Russia, which Ukraine perceives as the source of its most serious security
threat.
Ukraine also possesses 30 strategic bombers, stationed at the Uzin air-base,
just south of Kiev, and believed to carry a total of 416 bombs, including
cruise missiles. Western diplomats in the former Soviet Union think these
bombers, more modest in their capacity to wreak mass destruction, could
represent Ukraine's quickest and most effective route to nuclear capacity.
In contrast with the ICBMs, which, despite the Ukrainian ministry of
defence's best efforts, are still guarded by soldiers loyal to Moscow, the
bomber pilots publicly took an oath of allegiance to Kiev early in Ukraine's
drive for independence.
However, as Mr Blair points out, the bombs are stored separately from the
bombers and he believes that the officers commanding that base, though not
the soldiers, are still loyal to Moscow.
In a guarded room in one of Kharkov's sophisticated design bureaus,
Ukrainian scientists may well be investigating these technical avenues. But
whether they actually use their skills will be determined by the Ukrainian
government and its anxious relationship with Russia.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Bosnian peace talks resume with ultimatum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian peace talks finally resumed again in Geneva yesterday, amid a
Croat ultimatum that the Bosnian Moslems must accept proposed maps on the
republic's ethnic division or face more war.
Mr Mate Boban, the Croat leader, said: 'Any party that attempts to make
fundamental changes to the map we have negotiated so far does not want a
peace agreement, but wants delays and war instead.'
The remarks appeared to be a thinly veiled criticism of Mr Alija
Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem leader, and reflect mounting pressure from
Croat and Serb leaders on Mr Izetbegovic to accept a peace settlement based
on military gains made during the war.
Mr Izetbegovic has not so far submitted his proposal for the borders of the
future 'union' of the three ethnic republics.
His bitter opposition to an ethnic devision of Bosnia had previously been
one of the many sticking points in the negotiations. Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader, last week confirmed that the Bosnian delegation has
not actively participated in talks on the territorial division.
Instead, he has stressed that any agreement will be void without 'fair
maps'. These must guarantee a viable state which comprises at least 40 per
cent of Bosnian territory and provides access to the Adriatic Sea and the
northern River Sava.
At last evening's all-party session, the international mediators, Lord Owen
and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, intended to 'resolve outstanding areas of the
maps', said Mr John Mills, their spokesman.
Just minutes after the talks got underway, Mr Mills said all three parties
had agreed that 'UN military observers will be free to go everywhere in the
territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. Most previous agreements were immediately
violated.
Mr Izetbegovic said earlier that he would insist during the current talks
that Serb forces lift their siege of Sarajevo.
However, Commander Barry Frewer, Sarajevo spokesman for UN forces, yesterday
said that following the Serb withdrawal from strategic mountain heights
around the city this weekend, Sarajevo no longer faced a classic siege.
But although the UN yesterday said that the area around Sarajevo was now
quiet, the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) yesterday
said that central Bosnia remained very volatile, with fighting continuing
between Moslem and Croat forces.
Croat military leaders in Mostar, south-west Bosnia, were reported to be
still holding about 2,000 Moslem prisoners at a local airfield. They were
using some of their captives as forced labourers to dig trenches on the
frontlines, said relief officials.
Earlier in the day Croat leaders had threatened to boycott talks in Geneva
unless their Moslem enemies allowed relief convoys to cross frontlines to an
isolated town in central Bosnia.

FT  17 AUG 93 / AT&amp;T plans merger with McCaw: Proposed Dollars 12.3bn
telecommunications deal is one of biggest takeovers in US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph announced plans yesterday for a full-scale
merger with McCaw Cellular Communications in one of the US's biggest
takeover deals valued at Dollars 12.3bn (Pounds 8.2bn).
The all-share merger will bind the largest long-distance telecommunications
company in the US to the nation's biggest operator in the cellular telephone
market.
The deal replaces an earlier scheme, announced in November, for AT&amp;T to
acquire a one-third interest in McCaw, based in Kirkland, Washington. The
proposed merger would be the largest in a series of multi-billion dollar
transactions within the telecommunications sector recently - including a
Dollars 5.3bn tie-up between British Telecom and MCI, and US West's Dollars
2.5bn investment in Time Warner Entertainment.
BT, which had previously agreed to sell its 35.8m shares in McCaw - a 17 per
cent stake - to AT&amp;T for Dollars 1.75bn, will now receive an equivalent
number of shares in AT&amp;T instead, valued yesterday at Dollars 2.2bn. BT said
it still intended to sell its stake when the deal was completed.
In New York, AT&amp;T and McCaw said the merger agreement was an 'outgrowth of
discussions' held in the wake of the proposed share stake arrangement.
Mr Robert Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T, said the full merger would be 'a better
financial deal for AT&amp;T. If we were right strategically and added value to
McCaw (under the share stake arrangement), we'd have to pay for it later'.
Nevertheless, McCaw - an entrepreneurial company which has grown quickly in
the past decade from humble beginnings under its founder, Mr Craig McCaw -
is currently loss-making, and carries long-term debt of Dollars 4.9bn. AT&amp;T
expects to see earnings dilution of about 10 per cent in 1994, when the
merger is likely to be completed, but says there will be substantial
enhancement in the long term.
When the proposed share stake arrangement was announced, the partnership was
seen as putting AT&amp;T in direct competition with the regional Bell telephone
companies for the first time since the Bell system was broken up by court
order in 1984. Aside from McCaw, the wireless communications market is
dominated by large local telephone companies and GTE.
Mr Allen said: 'AT&amp;T is not interested in re-entering the local telephone
business and today's announcement doesn't change that. More than 99 per cent
of all cellular calls go through the local telephone companies.'
The deal is conditional on a go-ahead from various regulatory agencies -
including the Justice Department, which will look at anti-trust
considerations, and both the Federal Communications Commission and certain
state regulatory bodies, which must approve licence transfers.
Last night, Mr James Young, general counsel for Bell Atlantic, one of the
'Baby Bells', said the proposed merger raised 'serious competitive issues'.
The court agreement which broke up the old AT&amp;T, 'is being used by AT&amp;T as a
competitive weapon to keep their potentially strongest competitors out of
the market', he claimed. 'We and the other regional companies must be
allowed to compete equally with AT&amp;T or any other company anywhere in the
nation.'
The FCC said the proposed merger had 'great future potential' but it would
be 'open-minded on any valid opposition'. Assuming the deal goes ahead,
holders of both McCaw's 'A' and 'B' shares will receive one AT&amp;T share for
each McCaw share held. McCaw shareholders will end up owning around 14 per
cent of AT&amp;T.
On Wall Street, AT&amp;T shares slipped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 at the
close of trading while McCaw gained Dollars 5 to Dollars 56 1/4 .
Later in the day, Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the large US rating agencies,
said it was retaining AT&amp;T's long-term debt and commercial paper on
'creditwatch' for a possible downgrade. But it noted that the key regulatory
issues would not be resolved for at least six months.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Retail sales register strongest growth in three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL sales rose in July for the seventh consecutive month, registering
their strongest growth for more than three years, according to a
Confederation of British Industry survey published today.
The CBI's latest distributive trades survey shows that for the first time
since 1990, more companies are indicating that sales are above average,
rather than below, for the time of year.
The news may point to a consumer-led recovery, particularly after a string
of figures last week suggested growth in the manufacturing sector was
slowing.
But Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economic affairs, said the
improvement in sales suggested 'steady growth rather than a consumer boom.
Even now, fewer than one in four retailers considers trading conditions to
be good'.
The improvement has not yet benefited retailers of all sizes, according to
Mr Sudhir Junankar, an economist at the CBI.
'Retailers with only one outlet were still reporting that trade was lower
than a year earlier,' he said. 'This indicates that the steady monthly
growth in retail sales has not yet extended to all corners of the high
street.'
The CBI said the pick-up in retail spending was filtering through only
slowly to the rest of the economy. Retailers still consider stock levels to
be too high and orders placed with suppliers are growing at a much slower
rate than sales.
Official figures from the Central Statistical Office show retail sales to be
growing at an annualised rate of 3.1 per cent. Growth has been above 3 per
cent since March.
Car sales rose modestly in July after two months of year-on-year decline,
and orders for cars have risen sharply. There was a build up in stock levels
among wholesalers.
Overseas receipts of UK financial institutions jumped a net 19.8 per cent
last year from Pounds 15.7bn in 1991 to Pounds 18.8bn, British Invisibles, a
trade group, reported yesterday.
Nearly all sectors achieved improvements in overseas earnings, with
increased earnings from overseas portfolio investments fuelling much of the
rise. These were boosted by September's devaluation of the pound.
Overseas earnings from insurance institutions were particularly strong,
jumping by 21.6 per cent to Pounds 4.3bn and taking net overseas receipts
back to levels of 1987.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Germany urged ERM nations to delay rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY asked its European Community partners not to cut interest rates
precipitately when the rules of the European exchange rate mechanism were
changed this month, possibly explaining why interest rates in ERM countries
have hardly fallen since the currency crisis.
According to details that emerged yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank vice-president and president designate, made the request in the
early hours of Monday, August 2 after the EC's finance ministers and central
bank governors agreed to widen the ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent.
Mr Tietmeyer's request, which one European monetary official described
yesterday as a recommendation to the ERM crisis meeting in Brussels,
provides one reason for the failure of interest rates to decline rapidly
among Germany's ERM partners from the high levels established to protect the
'old ERM' with its 2.25 per cent and 6 per cent fluctuation margins from
currency speculation.
Some officials had expected the German request to receive a cool response.
But with the exception of Spain, the ERM countries have shown no hurry to
exploit the wider fluctuation bands and cut short-term interest rates with
the aim of boosting growth in their economies.
Further details of the early August crisis meeting to emerge appeared to put
an end to speculation that Germany and France might forge ahead with an
economic and monetary union of ERM 'core countries' ahead of the Maastricht
treaty timetable. This envisages European monetary union towards the end of
this decade.
When a Portuguese delegate suggested that the two logical solutions to the
ERM crisis were suspension of the system or immediate monetary union of the
French franc and the D-Mark, Mr Gert Haller, the newly appointed state
secretary in the German finance ministry, said he hoped the proposal of
immediate Franco-German monetary union was meant 'as a joke'. According to
European monetary officials, towards the end of the meeting, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor, came out on the side of the majority of ERM
ministers who rejected a generalised floating of EC currencies in favour of
the greatly widened bands. Although the chancellor later made clear Britain
had no plans to rejoin the ERM, which it left last September, Mr Clarke
backed Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC commissioner for monetary affairs,
in saying that a generalised float was a bad solution for the EC.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Sale ends Abbey National's Pounds 258m estate agency foray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL yesterday announced the sale of its 347-branch Cornerstone
estate agency chain for less than one-tenth of the price per outlet paid by
many buyers in the late 1980s.
The disposal will end a six-year venture into estate agency which has cost
the bank an estimated Pounds 258m.
Abbey is selling Cornerstone for Pounds 8m to two chartered surveyors who
are backed by Provident Life, the life insurance company. The deal will
create the UK's largest independently owned chain of estate agents.
The sale price is equivalent to Pounds 23,000 per agency, against prices of
about Pounds 250,000 per branch paid during the housing boom of the late
1980s as mortgage lenders and life companies competed to build up
distribution arms.
Abbey will still operate mortgage-selling units in 50 of the Cornerstone
branches and have mortgage business referred 'where appropriate'. The chain
will be tied to Provident Life for the sale of life assurance and pension
products.
Mr Tony Snarey, one of the purchasers, said yesterday: 'The price we are
paying is a bit of a watershed in estate agency values. They are realistic
and sustainable, and I think we have reached the bottom of the market now.'
Mr Snarey and the other purchaser, Mr Bill McClintock, were partners in two
independent estate agency chains bought by Royal Life in 1986, and took on
the running of Royal Life Estates before leaving this year.
He said the two partners would manage Cornerstone by encouraging initiative
in its managers. He added that ownership of estate agencies by mortgage
lenders had led to a 'culture clash' which stifled enterprise.
The sale expands the network of estate agency branches tied to Provident
Life to 1,100. Provident, the UK life arm of the Winterthur Swiss Insurance
Group, has achieved distribution through such deals rather than by buying
agents.
It said it had provided a 'quite small' loan to Mr Snarey and Mr McClintock
to buy Cornerstone, as well as supplying computer systems and staff training
to ensure that it complied with the 1986 Financial Services Act.
Mr John Finan, managing director, said the deal meant that Provident had
achieved its target for this year of acquiring distribution through more
than 1,000 branches.
Last year, Abbey made a Pounds 126m write down of 'goodwill' paid in
addition to the book value of agencies it bought to make up Cornerstone. It
also charged Pounds 12m in re-organisation costs, on top of losses of Pounds
90m accumulated over six years.
Mr Charles Toner, managing director of new businesses, said Abbey expected
to make a final write-down of up to Pounds 30m in the second half. It was
pleased to have sold the chain whole.

FT  17 AUG 93 / Factions reach deal on Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to put Sarajevo under temporary United Nations control was agreed 'in
principle' last night by the leaders of Bosnia's three warring factions.
The city's fate would be put on ice during negotiations on a three-way
carve-up of the rest of Bosnia on ethnic lines.
Earlier Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, had insisted that
ending the siege of Sarajevo must top the agenda of the latest talks on the
country's 17-month conflict.
The accord came just hours after Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders resumed
negotiations for the first time in two weeks.
However, officials warned that the agreement was not yet finalised. Mr John
Mills, spokesman for the international mediators, said: 'The devil is always
in the details.'

Mr Snarey and the other purchaser, Mr Bill McClintock, were partners in two

Mr Snarey said Royal Life had paid about 10 times the price per branch that

He said the two partners would manage Cornerstone by encouraging initiative

to make a final write-down of up to Pounds 30m in the second half. Abbey was
pleased to have sold the chain whole.
Mr Toner said the original strategy of protecting mortgage distribution by
buying estate agencies had not proved to be worth the investment because
only 5 per cent of its mortgage business was being referred through the
chain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEPOSED King Constantine of the Hellenes says he is just having a holiday in
Greece, for the first time since the monarchy was abolished in a referendum
in 1974, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
But his cruise aboard a Greek shipowner's yacht, together with his wife,
Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, and five children, is stirring controversy
by resembling a royal progress more than a family excursion.
The left-wing opposition expressed outrage that the government allowed the
former king to come home. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist leader,
demanded his immediate expulsion. One newspaper editorial wondered why his
two eldest sons, both in their 20s, were not arrested on arrival and taken
off to start military service, still compulsory in Greece.
A judge in Thessaloniki last week ordered an investigation to determine
whether the ex-king had committed any treasonable acts while on Greek soil,
such as inciting citizens to riot.
Even the government panicked when the ex-royal family disembarked in
northern Greece and set off to visit soldiers manning a border post on the
frontier with Macedonia. Their jeep had to turn back after finding the road
blocked by embarrassed local police officers.
The minority of Greeks who admit to being monarchists have no trouble
keeping up with the ex-king's activities. His trip is being exhaustively
covered by a private Greek TV channel, owned by another shipowner.

AN Arabic-speaking man claiming to have a bomb hijacked a Dutch aircraft
with 138 people aboard yesterday. He forced it to land in Dusseldorf and
demanded to be flown to New York, AP reports from Dusseldorf. It was not
clear whether the man was armed.
He was said to have demanded the US free a blind Islamic cleric, Sheikh Omar
Abdel-Rahman, linked to the bombing of New York's World Trade Centre.
All passengers and four of the seven crew members were released as the KLM
aircraft, which had been en route to Amsterdam from Tunis, Tunisia, sat on
the tarmac at Rhein-Ruhr Airport.
The aircraft, a Boeing 737-400, has a range of 3,800 km and would thus have
to make an intermediate refuelling stop to reach New York. It would first,
however, require refuelling in Dusseldorf.
Shortly before 1300 GMT yesterday, the hijacker gave the aircraft's captain
a note in English saying he would blow up the aircraft if it were not flown
to New York, according to KLM in Amsterdam.
The aircraft landed in Dusseldorf half an hour later. By 1530 GMT all but
three of the crew members - the pilot, a co-pilot and a steward - had been
freed, the airport official said.
Authorities said no one had been hurt. The hijacker was demanding that the
aircraft, which was surrounded by security forces and parked in front of a
hangar, be refuelled.
Police were negotiating with the hijacker by radio.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Warriors in a war of words: Christopher Parkes chronicles
the clashes between Volkswagen and GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On January 1, Ferdinand Piech was installed as chairman of Volkswagen. He
already knew the approximate scale of the task ahead of him: losses had
soared in the second half of 1992. The company was losing an estimated DM400
on every Golf it sold. Its six German works could break even only if
operated at more than 100 per cent of capacity. As was to emerge later,
full-year net earnings crashed almost 90 per cent to DM147m (Pounds 57.10m)
on record sales of DM85.4bn.
As Dan Jones, the motor industry guru and co-author of The machine that
changed the world, was to remark: VW needed a man like Piech to put a bomb
under the group.
The 56-year-old Austrian engineer had come eagerly to Wolfsburg, VW's
headquarters in Lower Saxony, from the relative calm of the Audi quality car
division in Ingoldstadt, Bavaria, where he had been chairman. The man who
once boasted that he could drive the 120km winding route from Ingoldstadt to
Munich without taking his foot off the accelerator, was pressing on the
pedal even before he had his hands on the wheel.
In mid-November 1992, through the good offices of Bosch, Germany's biggest
and most secretive vehicle components maker, he met his 'soul-mate', Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Piech's aim was to lure Lopez away from his job
as vice-president in charge of procurement at General Motors in Detroit and
install him in Wolfsburg.
Lopez, an eccentric, visionary Basque engineer, had been given his GM job in
May. He had been chosen by Jack Smith, GM president, to save the suffering
automotive giant by applying his rigorous cost-reduction tactics through the
agency of his troupe of so-called purchasing department 'warriors'.
Lopez had earned his stripes - and his nickname 'the Russelsheim strangler'
 -as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary.
Thanks largely to him, Russelsheim-based Opel had become the most profitable
car maker in the country.
Smith knew in December, Lopez says, that he had been approached by VW. But
then, as he did consistently through the following months, the Spaniard was
to assure the group president and his top-level colleagues that he would not
leave. As a trusted executive, he went about his business unhindered.
When he quit abruptly on March 10 this year, suspicions mushroomed about his
and his closest allies' activities in the interim, in which box-loads of
secret and confidential data about most of GM's future European plans were
allegedly systematically collected - only to disappear.
With hindsight, GM now suspects he may already have been working on VW's
behalf as early as December 2 last year. On that day he asked for, and
received 20 days later, GM Europe's so-called Epos list: computer-stored
details of parts prices and suppliers, equivalent to up to 90,000 print-out
sheets. According to Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice-president of GM Europe, they
were of no use to him in his US-based job. Was the bomb already ticking?
In January, Piech met Lopez again, at least once this month, around the time
of an extraordinary meeting of the VW supervisory board on Wednesday January
13.
January 13, Wolfsburg: the 20 men responsible for appointing and overseeing
the conduct of VW top management learn the scale of Mr Piech's plans. As
'preliminary' measures, the group workforce is to be cut from 270,000 to
240,000 in the medium term, and an investment plan agreed the previous
summer is torn up.
Jens Neumann, a close colleague of Piech at Audi, and newly-appointed
director in charge of group strategy, is given extra responsibilities for
'group management development'. The board agrees to meet again on March 16
to review developments.
January 14, Detroit: Lopez drafts a letter in Spanish, to be signed by Jack
Smith, telling a Basque banking and construction consortium that a plan to
build a super-lean production factory in Lopez's homeland has been 'put on
ice' because of over-capacity in Europe and poor business conditions. Lopez
and his countrymen will have to wait for the realisation of his top-secret
dream project, dubbed Plateau 6, on which he and a GM team have worked for
18 months.
January 15, Essen: Lopez meets Neumann for the first time: object, to
introduce the Basque to Klaus Liesen, chairman of Ruhrgas, head of the VW
supervisory board, and the man whose blessing is needed to appoint a new
director. Piech, Neumann says, was prevented from attending.
February 3, Munich: TopBusiness magazine completes its March issue for
printing. It contains an article on VW with pictures of new board members,
including one of Lopez, marked 'NEW', 'Production'. The February issue of
Manager Magazine, just out, earmarks Lopez as successor to Daniel
Goeudevert, Piech's deputy. Negotiations have been going on 'for weeks', it
says.
February 3, Russelsheim: Lopez attends a two-day meeting, called at his
request, at which he allegedly asks for and is given details of GM Europe's
purchasing, costs and new models strategies. During his visit he asks Dino
Martinez, his personal assistant, to clear his Opel office and send all
contents to Spain, care of Cirilo Uribe, a relation.
February 4, Frankfurt: Lopez leaves Opel talks for a meeting with Neumann to
discuss 'possible' employment contract details. The GM executive, Neumann
says, 'leaves open' the question of his joining VW.
February 5, Eisenach: Lopez, due to take Lufthansa flight LH4586 at 08.45 to
Zurich for meetings at GM Europe, turns up unexpectedly at Opel's brand-new
low-cost factory in former East Germany. He allegedly asks for and takes
documents on the plant's low-cost production system.
February 6, Russelsheim: He telephones Wolfsburg. Neumann says between
February 4 and March 9, the two spoke several times on contract details.
February 9, Russelsheim: Martinez ships the first batch of Lopez office
contents to Amorebieta, northern Spain.
Around this time, Jorge Manuel Gutierrez, Lopez's closest GM associate in
Detroit, is allegedly collecting Opel data.
February 17, Detroit: Gutierrez writes to Opel, asking for internal files on
the Corsa, Omega and Astra models and the successor to the Vectra, plus
details on engines and production plants. He will collect them on February
23, when he is due to arrive in Frankfurt.
February 23, Hanover: Officials in the Lower Saxony economics ministry - in
a position to speak since the state owns almost 20 per cent of VW and two
government ministers sit on its supervisory board - say Lopez is to join VW
at the March 16 session of the supervisory board. Privately and publicly,
Lopez denies the reports. 'I am happy here,' he says from Detroit.
March 7, Detroit: Gathering of GM/Opel employees at Gutierrez's home discuss
'rumours' that Lopez is about to go.
March 8: Alleged start of three-week 'recruiting' campaign said to be led by
Lopez, Gutierrez and colleague Rosario Piazza, in which about 40 GM/Opel
managers are asked to join VW. Some of the people approached were offered
double their current salaries.
March 8, Russelsheim: Lopez at top-level Opel international strategy board
meeting, allegedly given 2cm-thick wad of confidential documents on future
strategies.
At this meeting he learns that Spain is no longer to get Plateau 6, 'my
dream plant'. No final decision, but Hungary or Poland are more likely.
March 9, Frankfurt: Lopez meets Neumann for second time. Neumann has a
contract, signed on March 8 by Klaus Liesen. According to Neumann, the
contract was wrongly dated March 5 'because that was when the meeting with
Dr Liesen was originally planned'.
Neumann reminds Lopez that the March 16 supervisory board meeting is close.
Lopez accepts with an added proviso, that VW's life insurance on him should
be effective immediately the contract is signed.
At 21.57, immediately after putting his name to the document, Lopez calls
Piech 'happy that he would soon be a member of the VW family', according to
Neumann.
March 10, Russelsheim: Lopez attends an Opel human resources meeting. He
collects a binder of 'internal' documents and asks Martinez to send them to
Spain. He then flies to Detroit to inform Jack Smith.
March 12, Bloomfield Hills, near Detroit: Jack Smith, Harry Pearce, GM's top
laywer, and Rick Wagoner, finance director visit Lopez and plead with him to
stay. VW formally announces Lopez is changing sides.
March 12, Wolfsburg: Neumann receives call from an 'emotionally shocked'
Lopez at 05.30 Detroit time, who allegedly says he will stick to his promise
to come to VW.
March 13, Wolfsburg: at 11.00 (05.00 in Detroit) Neumann receives another
call. Smith and his wife have applied more 'emotional pressure', but Lopez
is resolute. 'The word of a Basque cannot be broken,' he tells Neumann.
At 16.00 (10.00 in the US) on the same day, Piech tells Neumann to stay in
close touch with the Spaniard.
Half an hour later, Neumann calls Lopez, who tells him four GM board members
just left his home. He has agreed not to leave the US group. He begs Piech
to forgive him. 'He was a broken man,' says Neumann.
But by 14.00 Detroit time, Piech and Lopez have agreed on a year's delay
before he leaves GM for VW. The German group announces that he will not be
coming 'now', and blames interference from Smith.
March 13, Detroit: Late evening, at a social gathering Lopez dictates
outline of a speech in the late evening to Toni Simonetti, his PR aide. The
speech is to be prepared for delivery at 13.00 on March 15, and will explain
why he has chosen to stay in the US. According to her notes, read out
recently in a court, VW had offered to implement his plan for the Plateau 6
factory in Spain. At GM there was now a 'stronger commitment'. Lopez then
instructed Simonetti not mention the plant in her draft.
March 15, Detroit: GM has tried to lock Lopez in with a five-year contract.
At 10.45 US time, as he put the finishing touches to his 'I'm staying'
speech, he calls Neumann, who notes he is 'very unhappy'. Within 15 minutes
he has had a call from Piech, who asks him to get on a aircraft. Lopez
leaves almost immediately with American Airlines.
March 16, Braunschweig airport: Lopez is picked up and taken to a welcoming
VW supervisory board meeting.
In Detroit, Harry Pearce orders a search of the lost executive's office. The
office of Gutierrez, away on GM business, is also searched around this time.
Gutierrez failed to return from his trip and next appeared in Wolfsburg.
March 17, Detroit: Alan Perriton, a GM purchasing executive who searched the
offices, signs an affidavit that none of the secret and confidential
document allegedly in the two executives' possession was to be found.
March 22, Detroit and Russelsheim: six of Lopez's buying executives abruptly
leave GM/Opel, citing 'personal reasons', and turn up at VW, according to
Lopez, without firm job offers or contracts.
Week beginning March 22, Wolfsburg: in VW's Rotehof guesthouse, at the
suggestion of Lopez, his 'warriors' allegedly destroy his personal office
contents - including possibly secret or sensitive Opel material  - to
prevent, it is said, any such data finding its way into VW's possession.
March 25, Wolfsburg: Press statement says Werner Svetlik, procurement chief
for the VW brand since January is to leave and will be replaced by Gutierrez
on April 1.
April 2, Detroit: Harry Pearce writes to Lopez, seeking unequivocal
statement on missing documents. Lopez finally replies about two weeks later
that neither he nor his colleagues took any secrets when they left and nor
did they have any now.
April 2, Frankfurt: A regional court issues a temporary injunction
preventing VW from systematically recuiting Opel and GM staff.
Mid-April, Wiesbaden: Witnesses allegedly hear and see documents being
shredded all night long by Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Rosario Piazza, two
ex-Opel men who had followed their leader to VW.
April 30, Darmstadt: Opel asks public prosecutors to investigate its
supsicions of theft and industrial espionage.
May 24, Hamburg: Der Spiegel publishes eight-page article: 'A clear view
into the guts' with detailed allegations of spying against Lopez and his
warriors.
May 24, Braunschweig: Lopez reads out a statement: 'What did I bring with
me? My personal knowledge, motivation, a desire to make quantum leaps at VW
 -and no secret documents.'
May 25, Darmstadt: Prosecutors, having examined Opel evidence, announce they
have enough to launch a criminal investigation. Piech tells FT Lopez
approached him first.
June 4, Hanover: VW supervisory board announces full confidence in Lopez at
annual meeting where Piech says the group will return to profit in the
second half after a DM1.25bn loss in the first quarter.
June 14, Hanover: Lopez gives first press conference and says he lost all
will to work at GM when he learnt his dream plant would not be built in his
Basque homeland. In Madrid the same day, he reportedly claims it will be
built instead by VW in 1996. He denies all allegations, and says he and
Piech were brought together by an intermediary.
June 22, Wiesbaden: Four boxes, allegedly left behind by Alvarez and Piazza
in their former home, are handed to police and on to the investigating
prosecutors.
July 2, Wolfsburg: Daniel Goeudevert, once favoured to run VW, resigns, but
is tied in with a consultancy contract.
July 3, Darmstadt: Georg Nauth, prosecutors' spokesman, says the
investigation has advanced a 'decisive step' forward.
July 9: In a newspaper interview Piech says the Basque factory will not be
built by VW at this time. It was out of the question, and he had told Lopez.
July 14, Washington: US justice department lets it be known it is
investigating the Lopez case on its own initiative.
July 15, Hamburg: Der Spiegel presents written and oral evidence in the
state court in a bid to prevent VW from stopping its reporting on the issue.
Witnesses contradict Lopez affidavits on several counts.
July 20, Hamburg: Court allows Der Spiegel almost free rein. Costs, shared
under German law according to the extent to which the parties involved have
won or lost, are split 30:70 per cent against VW.
July 20, Wolfsburg: Neumann issues personal statement on his contacts with
Lopez, stating that he never wanted, asked for, was offered, received or had
any GM secrets.
July 22, Darmstadt: Investigators reveal that boxes from Wiesbaden contain
details of a secret Opel mini-car which 'should be accessible or made known
only to top-level management'. Slides and transparencies also found had been
collated and translated at the express wish of Lopez. 'The investigation
will continue with special emphasis on the interrogation of witnesses from
VW,' the prosecutors' office says.
July 23, Wolfsburg: Inner circle of VW supervisory board summons Piech and
demands explanations and more convincing public response to charges.
July 28, Wolfsburg: Piech reacts at press conference, called at short
notice; accuses Opel of mudslinging, conducting an international war against
VW and Germany, and suggests - saying, 'there were other hands involved' -
that GM/Opel planted secrets in Wiesbaden and may have hacked into VW's
computers to plant secrets there. He says he has ordered an internal
electronic audit.
In Darmstadt, meanwhile, investigators have received from Neumann a detailed
chronology of the tug-of-war in early March when Jack Smith tried to snatch
Lopez back from VW.
July 29, Frankfurt: Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice president of GM Europe, describes
Piech attacks as 'grotesque'. The VW chairman's warlike words suggested a
'psychosis-like bunker mentality'.
July 30, Wolfsburg: Piech calls Smith in bid to call off the offensive.
August 2, Detroit: Smith and Piech talk on telephone. The VW chairman is
told there will be no further communications until he withdraws his
allegations, and even then any contacts should be in writing with David
Herman, Opel chairman.
August 6, Wolfsburg: Klaus Liesen returns from holiday in Majorca to chair
an emergency meeting of the VW supervisory board, following signs of
wavering support among members, and complaints that they were not being kept
fully informed.
Lopez appears to contradict his earlier public claim that he never took any
secret documents and tells board that papers from his former offices were
destroyed, including 'possibly secret or sensitive' GM/Opel material, in
Wiesbaden and during his stay at the group's Rotehof guesthouse in late
March. The aim was to avoid any danger that such data could be circulated
within VW, he says.
The board's statement after the meeting, which pledges Lopez 'unaltered
support', and says no grounds were found to warrant accusations of
industrial espionage, notes: 'No possibly secret documents left the
possession of former GM employees and came into the possession of VW.'
August 8, Russelsheim: Opel welcomes the 'belated' admission that documents
had been destroyed and returns to the attack with a reminder that the
investigations also include suspicions of theft, fraud and perjury. 'Based
on the present status of the investigation, it is apparent that in a
concerted action thousands of pages of highly-sensitive data concerning
cost-structures, manufacturing and future planning were stolen,' Opel says.
August 12, Darmstadt: Prosecutors interrogate Daniel Goeudevert, the former
VW director displaced on July 2. Although out of the inner circle, he is
likely to be well-informed on the timing and details of the initial contacts
between Piech and Lopez.
Nauth, the prosecutors' spokesman, says VW witnesses will be re-examined
after reports that a female employee had told a third party that she had
seen the Opel logo on data she punched into the VW computer system under
instructions from an assistant to Lopez.
August 13, Russelsheim: Opel reveals that the FBI has demanded to see all GM
group data and affidavits relevant to the case. According to one company
official: 'There are box loads of the stuff.'
In Wolfsburg, almost 12 weeks after public prosecutors said they had enough
evidence to support a criminal investigation, the VW supervisory board says
it has appointed auditors, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, to carry out an
independent probe within Volkswagen.
August 14, Hamburg: Der Spiegel claims a dozen VW trainees punched GM/Opel
data into VW computers at the end of March. Volkswagen says it will make no
further comments on the case.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE WAKE of the recent turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism, dealers
will look for more pressure on the French franc and the Danish krone this
week, writes James Blitz.
On Friday both currencies were subjected to a new bout of selling against
the D-Mark, with the French currency dropping to its lowest London close
against the D-Mark. The Danish krone also fell sharply, ending more than 8.5
percentage points lower than the D-Mark in the ERM grid.
Many currency dealers are certain the franc is heading for the FFr3.60 level
against the D-Mark. The big question is whether it will get there sooner
rather than later.
Dealers will wait to see what the Bank of France does to interest rate
policy in its money market operations today and on Thursday. The country's
industrial production figures for June, due out the same day, could also
depress the franc if they are particularly bad.
Dealers will also look closely at France's weekly foreign exchange reserve
figures on Thursday to see whether the central bank has restored them since
the widening of the ERM's fluctuation bands.
In Germany, the M3 money supply figures for July are due at the end of the
week and these will indicate how big a monetary overhang there is after the
Bundesbank's intervention in currency markets. Economists at Paribas Capital
Markets anticipate a rise to 8.2 per cent from 7.0 per cent in June.
In the UK, attention will focus on prospects for another cut in interest
rates. The Retail Prices Index, due on Wednesday, will reveal whether there
are further inflationary pressures in the economy. The UK's visible trade
figures, due on Friday, will indicate whether exports have been adversely
affected by the pound's recent strength.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Spate of call-warrant issues as gold loses
some of its lustre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decline in the price of gold in recent weeks has coincided with a spate
of issues of gold warrants by banks. Most have been call warrants, allowing
holders to buy gold at a pre-determined price. Essentially, call warrants
are attractive to investors with a bullish view on the gold market.
Deutsche Bank, Swiss Bank Corporation, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit
Suisse Financial Products are among the houses to have issued one or more
series of warrants in the past two weeks.
So why has heavy issuance of warrants coincided with the market's decline,
after the price of gold rallied from around Dollars 330 at the start of the
year to just over Dollars 400 at the beginning of this month? And why has it
come at a time when most analysts have decided that inflation, against which
gold is often used as a hedge, is less of a problem than they had thought?
The cynical answer is that the banks which issued (or wrote) the warrants
felt that the rally was over and they stood to earn handsome returns by
writing warrants without hedging their positions.
However, there does seem to be demand for the warrants, both among
continental European retail investors and some institutions.
Investors tend to buy warrants - which are essentially long-dated options -
when they are less sure of their view on the market. An investor holding a
call warrant stands to lose the cost of the warrant - or premium - if the
market moves the wrong way, but an outright purchase of gold leaves an
investor with potentially unlimited exposure if the market collapses.
Consequently, for investors who still believe gold could rally further, but
are not firmly convinced, warrants offer an attractive alternative. They
also allow investors to take a view on the market using only a small
investment and maximising the amount of leverage.
One analyst said that some investors with bond portfolios had bought gold
warrants as a hedge against inflation. There is a growing wave of opinion
that inflation in the most developed economies is likely to remain low, and
many investors have positioned themselves by taking large positions in the
bond market. However, a hedge against inflation could prove a useful
insurance policy if their expectations are disappointed.
Institutions may prefer to buy over-the-counter options on gold, rather than
warrants, because OTC options can be structured to suit their needs. But the
advantage of warrants is that they can be traded, since the banks that issue
them are committed to making a market.
Gold warrants can therefore be an attractive tool for taking a speculative
position that the gold market will rally. A number of analysts are still
quite positive on the prospects for gold. 'Our view is that this pull-back
is a bit greater than we would have thought, but it is not unexpected,' said
Mr Michael Coulson, at Credit Lyonnais.
There are still reasons to believe that the market's potential is capped by
factors such as potential selling by central banks, which need to shore up
their foreign exchange reserves. Further, the inflation potential of OECD
countries is indeed restrained.
But gold is one of the most international markets, and active buyers can be
found in countries where there are substantial fears about the inflationary
outlook. In OECD countries, some analysts believe low interest rates will
encourage investment in commodities, since investors are sacrificing only a
small loss of income by buying gold.

FT  16 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark deal highlights progress of
Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH last week of a SFr1bn Eurobond issue by the Kingdom of Denmark
has highlighted the steady progression of Switzerland from a bond market
dominated by retail investors into one which can satisfy the requirements of
large borrowers and institutional investors.
Denmark's six-year offering, which rivalled the record for a single Swiss
bond transaction set by the Republic of Austria at the end of June, came as
a surprise to the market.
The kingdom, which has been borrowing heavily to replenish foreign exchange
reserves depleted by the heavy currency intervention to restore stability to
the European exchange rate mechanism, had been expected to opt for the more
liquid French franc sector.
The two big sovereign deals have encouraged syndicate managers at the Swiss
banks, especially since they have been making a concerted effort to convince
international borrowers that the Swiss bond market is capable of
accommodating large bond issues.
Another feather in their cap is the SFr600m, 10-year offering from the
Inter-American Development Bank which was launched in July.
The syndicate managers are confident that it will only be a matter of time
before 'the right issuer at the right price' can push the record for a
single transaction in the Swiss bond market up to SFr1.25bn.
'The Swiss bond market is receptive to excellent names,' says one manager.
The market anticipates that several more sovereign and supranational
borrowers will tap the market in the coming weeks.
Certainly, the Swiss banks' marketing campaign has been helped by a series
of measures by the government and the Swiss National Bank in the last year
to liberalise capital markets, ranging from cutting turnover tax to relaxing
syndication regulations.
The impact of the measures has been to reduce dramatically the cost to both
the issuer and investor. This in turn has made the foreign sector much
cheaper than the domestic market, hence increasing volume and liquidity.
Total new issue volume in the Swiss bond market in 1993 to date has been
SFr23.3bn, compared with a total of SFr26.1bn for the whole of 1992.
The turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism has also worked in
the favour of the Swiss bond market, as investors took refuge in the
relative safety of the Swiss franc.
Although the foreign money did not necessarily go into the bond market,
bankers said the inflow had a positive impact on the market's liquidity.
The currency's consequent appreciation has increased expectations of lower
interest rates in Switzerland, which in turn has resulted in a significant
drop in bond yields. Some economists expect Swiss short-term rates to fall
to 4 per cent by the end of the year from their current level of around 4.55
per cent.
UBS, which arranged Denmark's offering, is particularly positive on interest
rates and its stance is reflected in the pricing of the bonds. They carry a
coupon of 4.25 per cent, which compares with a coupon of 4.5 per cent on
Austria's bonds which have a 6 1/2 year maturity.
Inevitably, this has prompted some criticism in the market, especially among
those who believe that Swiss interest rates have reached a plateau and that
the Danish offering was unrealistically priced.
'The pricing is anticipating a fall in interest rates well in advance of the
event,' one banker said.
Officials at UBS reject this criticism and say they are confident that the
entire issue will be placed by the payment date on September 30, and that by
then its yield will look more attractive.
Irrespective of when the next interest rate cut will occur, investors are
increasingly taking the view that Swiss interest rates are close to their
floor.
Therefore most of the recent issues do not have a maturity of more than
seven years. 'Investors believe that interest rates will be higher in four
or five years,' one banker said.
In spite of their recent achievements, however, Swiss syndicate managers are
careful not to get too carried away.
They note that the recent spate of offerings, and the prospect of some more
large deals in the pipeline, has prompted some concern of over-supply in the
primary market.
Furthermore, the syndicate managers report that investors have been
switching out of the Swiss bond market and into other higher-yielding
markets elsewhere in Europe.

FT  16 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Yields continue to fall towards 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE the best of times for US bond market investors. It is difficult to
imagine how conditions could be much more favourable to holders of
government securities.
Inflationary pressures are almost totally absent from the economy. Because
of that, monetary policy is on hold with interest rates near record lows.
The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meets later this
week and the expectations on Wall Street are that the FOMC will vote to keep
the bias of policy neither inclined to an easing nor to a tightening.
Inflation will probably stay low because the economy is growing so slowly.
Recent economic data have painted a picture of an economy still struggling
to break out of its post-recession blues.
After a short burst of growth in the final quarter of last year, output has
dropped significantly this year, and there is little sign that the economy
will pick up until at least next year.
Supply conditions favour the long end of the market. Just over Dollars 11bn
in 30-year securities were sold at auction last week, but because of the
Treasury's decision earlier this year to try to lower the cost of financing
the federal deficit by cutting the supply of bonds and shortening the
maturity of the national debt, the final bond auction of 1993 is already out
of the way with only two-thirds of the year completed.
The political environment is also favourable to bonds. President Bill
Clinton's first budget was passed by Congress 10 days ago, and in spite of
its tax increases, it was warmly welcomed by fixed-income investors.
This is primarily because most bond economists expect the deficit-reduction
package to slow economic growth over the next year or so. Also, the bond
market likes the budget because it is regarded as the first attempt (albeit
a flawed one) by a modern US administration to tackle the huge federal
deficit.
Even the foreign exchange markets have been boosting bond prices, although
only indirectly. Recent turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism
and cuts in interest rates across Europe sent investors scurrying into the
dollar as a safe haven. When foreign investors seek the security of dollar
assets, many buy US government securities.
It should be no surprise, therefore, to see bond yields at historic lows. As
of Friday afternoon, the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue had dropped to
6.34 per cent, the lowest since 1971. This is all the more remarkable
considering less than three months ago bond yields were at 7 per cent and
rising.
The market's rally has stunned economists. In the Wall Street Journal's
survey of forecasts last December, no less than 44 top economists predicted
that long yields would be at 7.44 per cent by the end of June this year.
That they were more than 100 basis points out is mostly due to their failure
to forecast economic growth accurately.
At the end of last year the economy was growing at a healthy pace, and
economists were forecasting continued strong growth, resurgent inflation,
and a tighter monetary policy.
They were wrong on all three counts, because the strong growth recorded
during the final quarter of 1992 proved to be a temporary blip on the screen
 -a short, unsustainable burst of economic activity tied as much to the
election of a new president as it was to any fundamental improvement in
consumer and corporate sentiment.
How far can bond yields fall? If inflation remains as subdued as it is now
('core' consumer and producer prices both rose a meagre 0.1 per cent in
July), if monetary policy remains on hold, and if the Clinton budget has a
dampening effect on economic activity, then bond yields of below 6 per cent
by the end of the year are not out of the question.

FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation forecasts boost prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRIVEN by more signs of easing inflationary pressures, gilts continued their
recent rise, helped by a generally optimistic assessment by the Bank of
England about future price trends.
Yields of gilts at the 10-year maturity fell by about 20 basis points on the
week to be quoted on Friday night at about 6.9 per cent.
The decline at the longer end of the yield curve was even greater, partly as
a result of the announcement by the Bank on Friday that there would be no
gilt auction at the end of this month.
That statement followed from the good progress by Threadneedle Street in
selling bonds to cover the expected Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing
requirement this financial year.
Just four and a half months into the year the Bank has accounted for nearly
60 per cent of deficit by selling about Pounds 29bn worth of gilts.
With the summer holidays in full swing, it is no wonder that Bank officials
calculated they could take a rest from new gilt auctions, which recently
have been held at the rate of one a month.
The Bank's announcement, which came at the end of a week in which it sold
more than Pounds 1.5bn of gilts through taps, triggered spiralling prices at
the long end of the yield curve, leaving long-dated gilts up a net  3/4 of a
point on the day.
Sentiment about gilts was helped earlier in the week by the Bank's latest
inflation report, which said that the Treasury's favoured measure of
underlying inflation is unlikely to breach the government's 4 per cent
ceiling in the next two years.
This measure defines underlying inflation as the year-on-year rise in the
retail prices index excluding mortgage payments.
The generally positive views about price pressures came in a comprehensive
Bank study which discussed more than 28 ways of measuring inflation.
The report said: 'Many goods prices are rising more slowly than three months
ago, and inflation in the service sector has fallen considerably.'
The view that price pressures are likely to stay muted was supported by news
that manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 3 per cent
lower in the three months to June than they were in the same three months a
year ago. This figure compares with a fall of 3.4 per cent in the three
months to May.
In addition, average earnings growth across the economy slowed to an
underlying 3.5 per cent in the year to June, the lowest figure for 25 years
and a quarter of a percentage point lower than the figure for the 12 months
to May.
While encouraged by these findings, gilt investors also warmed to the tone
of other UK economic data last week pointing to a slowing in the pace of the
recovery in manufacturing.
Significant manufacturing and export growth in the first half of the year
has been the driving force behind the signs of economic revival after the
long recession.
However, gilt investors would like to see a deceleration in the recovery
profile, on the grounds that this would be less likely to stimulate
inflationary pressures.
On this basis, the announcement that manufacturing output in June dropped by
2.1 per cent compared with May was greeted enthusiastically by many gilt
market participants.
This was the sharpest monthly drop since February 1988.
Even though the June figure partly compensated for a big increase in output
in May, it underlined the belief that manufacturers are unlikely to see the
favourable trading conditions that they enjoyed in the first half of 1993
replicated in the second half. This is partly because of a slowdown in
important export markets in continental Europe.
A survey conducted jointly by the Confederation of British Industry and
Business Strategies, a consultancy, said that manufacturing order books in
six out of the 11 UK regions were in a weaker position in July than three
months earlier. This supported the gloomier tone of prognostications about
the sector's outlook.
The level of orders in northern and north-west England, the south-east, west
Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland were all worse in the current survey
compared with three months earlier.
However, the levels of output volumes fell over the same period only in four
regions - the south-east, south-west, north-west and Wales.
The survey said that inflationary pressures across the country were subdued,
while the best prospects for manufacturing were in the west Midlands and
Scotland.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Japanese Bonds: Hopes of recovery fade as yen rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE bond market has brushed aside uncertainty over economic policy
of the country's new government, which took office last week, and has
instead focused on further evidence of a weaker economy, driving long-term
interest rates down to five-month lows.
The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark fell to 3.995 per cent - the first
time since March 19 that it had fallen below 4 per cent - before closing the
week at 4.08 per cent.
Hopes of an imminent recovery have faded as the economy faces an increasing
number of stumbling blocks. Aside from continuing sluggishness in corporate
activities, consumer spending has been hit by bad summer weather, and the
yen's rise to record levels threatens to strangle exports.
The ratio of job offers to applicants fell to 74:100 in June, down from
81:100. Industrial production declined by 5.1 per cent from the previous
year, falling for the 21st consecutive month, while machinery orders fell
again for the 15th successive month, a down 13.3 per cent.
The unusually long rainy season and cool summer have depressed sales of air
conditioners, clothing and beer, which usually rise during the summer. Even
if the weather improves, retailers do not expect a rapid recovery to make up
for the earlier losses.
The yen has appreciated 21.5 per cent from the beginning of the year,
closing the week in Tokyo at a record Y102.40 to the dollar. Traders said
the trade surplus, which rose 28 per cent in July, was the leading cause,
while speculation of political pressure from the US is also driving the yen
higher.
Such factors, along with the Bank of Japan's unexpected easy stance over its
money market operations last week, have heightened hopes of monetary easing.
The central bank allowed three-month certificate of deposit yields to fall
to 3.1 per cent on Friday, down from 3.23 per cent at the start of the week.
The overnight call rate, which is closely controlled by the BoJ's money
market operations, fell through a perceived floor of 3.2 per cent to 3.18
per cent.
Concerns over extra supply due to redemptions of equity-linked bonds have
also been put aside. According to the Bank for International Settlements,
equity-linked bond redemptions peaked during the April-June quarter,
totalling Dollars 26.5bn. The BIS said many corporate issuers raised funds
during the first quarter, leading to a decline in bond placements in the
second quarter.
Meanwhile, some analysts see the pessimism over recovery as overstated,
since the widely-expected cut in the official discount rate will help a
gradual recovery. Moreover, although bad weather may postpone a rise in
consumption, it does not cancel it.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, points out that
the yen is in 'overshoot territory' since, in yen terms, the trade surplus
has peaked and has started to decline. Using the correlation between the
yen-based trade surplus and long bond yields, he predicts that the coming
two months is the last leg of a three-year decline in interest rates.
While the US dollar-based trade surplus has been rising, on a yen basis it
has peaked and has been falling month on month since spring. Since a fall in
the trade surplus means an increase in the outflow of funds, this eventually
leads to a gradual rise in interest rates. Long-term interest rates lag
about six months behind the yen-based trade surplus, and the yield on the
benchmark may be close to a bottom.
Mr Barker predicts that the yield on the No 145 benchmark still has room to
fall to the 3.8 per cent level, reached earlier this year, and advises
taking profits around that level.

production of epoxy resin
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Chemical, supplier of most of the epoxy resin used in making
semiconductors, expects to resume production around the end of the year
after an explosion last month halted output at its plant in south-western
Japan.
Spot prices for memory chips soared as a result of the accident, and the
share price of Nippon Kayaku, the other main Japanese supplier of the
material, reached new highs last week after it announced that it was
increasing capacity.
Sumitomo initially expects to bring back on stream one of the two production
lines at its factory in Niihama, which accounted for about 60 per cent of
the world market for epoxy resin.
Sumitomo Chemical says the episode will have no material impact on its
earnings, although it has declined to make a forecast for this year. The
company slipped into loss for the first half to June.

FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Group loss at Banesto for first
six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the big Spanish banking group, has reported a consolidated loss of
Pta130m (Dollars 915,000) for the first half of 1993, compared with a group
profit of Pta32.7bn in the same period last year.
The first-half figures, which include the Banesto parent, its affiliated
banks and its big industrial holding company, were released two days after
Banesto announced it had completed a record Pta94bn capital increase.
The first-half figures are not surprising, as Banesto has been making big
provisions and weaker profits from its banks have not been enough to cover
losses in the industrial group as Spain has sunk further into recession.
The banking group reported first-half profits earlier this year of Pta5.7bn,
down 82.6 per cent on 1992.
While the consolidated figures also show that Banesto is having some trouble
containing operating costs, the first-half loss is nevertheless a sharp
improvement on the Pta2.4bn deficit reported for the first three months of
this year.
Banco Central Hispano made a net profit of Pta39.6bn in the first half of
the year, a 6.6 per cent increase on 1992.
The bank said that it had allocated Pta54.6bn to depreciation and
provisions, a 46.4 per cent increase on last year.

<TEXT>
LAURENTIAN Group, the Canadian financial services company being merged with
the larger Mouvement Desjardins, reported first-half net profit of CDollars
15.8m (USDollars 12m), or 25 cents a share, up from Dollars 14.3m, or 23
cents, a year earlier, on revenues which were little changed at Dollars
1.4bn.
Second-quarter profit was equal to 12 cents a share, compared with 10 cents
last time.
The group's assets rose to Dollars 15.7bn at June 30, with the expansion of
the Laurentian Bank.
The life and general insurance units improved their results sharply.
Imperial Life, Laurentian's biggest single unit, doubled first-half profit
to Dollars 14.1m, or Dollars 5.89 a share, on revenues of Dollars 569m, up
from Dollars 561m.
With the merger due to be completed next month, Laurentian and Desjardins
will put their financial services units into a new holding company to be
minority-held by the public.
The total combined group, including the Desjardins credit union branches,
will have assets of nearly Dollars 80bn, including funds under management.
It will rank as the sixth-largest banking and financial services group in
Canada.
Abitibi-Price, Canada's biggest newsprint producer, is raising between
CDollars 100m and CDollars 125m with a public offer of common stock next
month.
The issue is being underwritten by a group led by the brokers Nesbitt
Thomson, and will consist of between 8m and 10m shares priced at CDollars
12.75 each. The offer is not being registered in the US.
Proceeds will be used to repay short-term debt and bolster working capital.
Abitibi already has the lowest debt-equity ratio in the Canadian forest
products industry.

FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swiss wake up to winds of change
 -Once content with modest returns from their protected home market, SBC,
UBS and Credit Suisse are now among the world's more profitable banks /
Exchange-rate turmoil has reinforced traditional safe-haven status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once content with modest returns from their protected home market, SBC, UBS
and Credit Suisse are now among the world's most profitable banks, reports
Ian Rodger
THE SWISS, according to a joke they like to tell against themselves, get up
early but they wake up late.
The big three Swiss commercial banks - Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS),
Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) - were among the slowest to
wake up to the liberalising winds that swept through the world banking
industry in the 1980s.
Comfortable in their protected home market, they were content to make modest
returns on their exceptionally strong capital bases.
But the revelation by UBS last Thursday of first-half consolidated net
income of SFr1.29bn (Dollars 845m) - 40 per cent of it coming from overseas
operations - indicates that they are now wide awake and among the world's
more profitable commercial banks, as well as the soundest.
Credit Suisse will report its first-half result on Wednesday and SBC on
September 2. Both are expected to reveal profit growth similar to the 89 per
cent surge at UBS.
The transformation at these banks dates from about two years ago, when their
traditionally dependable profit streams were coming under increasing threat
and the need to cut costs and develop new sources of income became pressing.
In Switzerland, they were forced to break up the pacts by which they long
shared dominant positions in the lush domestic securities markets. And with
the end of the cold war and the stabilisation of west European currencies,
it looked as if the country's role as a safe haven for capital was becoming
obsolete. Meanwhile, a deepening domestic recession was exposing the
excessive commercial banking capacity in the Swiss market.
Like the Japanese, the Swiss take a long time to get moving, but once they
do, they tend to move quickly. In the past couple of years, more than 60
banks have disappeared, and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse,
virtually completed the process of domestic rationalisation in April with
its SFr1.6bn acquisition of Swiss Volksbank.
Abroad, the three turned equally decisive. In 1991, after seven years of
struggle, UBS finally began to see some profits from its acquisition of
Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
Coincidentally, Credit Suisse was bailing out its First Boston investment
banking subsidiary in New York and SBC was forming what has turned out to be
a highly profitable alliance with O'Connor, the Chicago derivatives
partnership.
By the first half of this year, these efforts were paying off handsomely, as
the UBS results show. But the Swiss have also been very lucky.
Fiscal troubles in Germany, political upheaval in Italy, explosions within
the European exchange rate mechanism - this is the stuff on which safe
havens thrive. Since last summer, huge sums of money have poured into Swiss
banks, mainly from Germany and Italy, but also from other European
countries.
This enabled the Swiss National Bank to start lowering interest rates long
before its counterparts in other continental European countries. From a peak
of more than 9 per cent in May of last year, the three-month Euro-Swiss
franc rate has plunged to 4.5 per cent.
While banks in other European countries are only beginning to be able to
widen their spreads, Swiss banks have been doing so for nearly a year. In
its typically cautious way, UBS managed to hide much of the positive impact,
recording only a modest 10.9 per cent gain in net interest income in the
first half.
(UBS raised its bad loan provisions in the first half by SFr265m, rather
more than the SFr188m by which it raised its net interest income. For a bank
that was shrewd enough to avoid any exposure to Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck
and Olympia &amp; York, this performance is, to say the least, implausible.)
But the main contributor to the UBS profit gain was trading. The bank's
profits from securities and foreign exchange trading soared by 144 per cent
in the first half to SFr1.55bn, due to an extraordinary combination of
positive forces.
Foreign exchange markets continued to be active in the first half, as the
yen rose against the dollar and various European currencies were under
pressure against the D-Mark.
Bond markets have risen and the London stock market, where UBS is a leading
participant, was also buoyant. The Swiss stock market has been a spectacular
performer, with a 26 per cent advance in the all share Swiss Performance
Index since the beginning of the year.
Analysts were fulsome in their praise for UBS. A couple worried about the
excessive contribution of volatile trading income to profits, but Mr Derek
Bullman of London broker James Capel said any reduction in trading income in
the near future would be offset by continued recovery in other operations
and reduced provisions. 'I am not worried about the bottom line at all,' he
said.
Analysts are also confident that Credit Suisse and SBC have benefited from
the same factors that lifted the UBS result. 'Credit Suisse has already been
getting a larger portion of its earnings from securities and commissions
than the other two,' Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss brokerage research at
Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, pointed out.
However, special factors make it difficult to estimate the results from
both. Credit Suisse figures will include for the first time the activities
of Swiss Volksbank, and no one knows how rationalisation costs or the
roughly SFr400m of 'badwill' acquired as a result of paying less than book
value will be treated.
SBC profits should show the highest growth rate, but only because they will
be compared with an exceptionally poor first half of 1992. Net income from
operations plunged 30 per cent to SFr758m then, mainly because of the costs
of reorganising the group's Swiss private banking subsidiaries and of
integrating O'Connor.
The shares of all three banks have performed extremely well this year, and
analysts, while still confident of further profit growth, are becoming
cautious about recommending them. 'They are not yet overvalued, but they
will probably have a bit of a pause,' predicted Mr Daniel Koenig, banking
analyst at Pictet in Geneva.

FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Probe into FFr1.2bn bid to take
control of Fnac

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Fnac, one of France's largest retail groups and the leading
force in the music and books market, has been flung into doubt with the
announcement of an official investigation into a bid for control of the
group.
The Commission des Operations des Bourse (COB), the Paris stock market
watchdog, has ordered a formal inquiry into the price of the FFr1.2bn
(Dollars 198m) bid for a controlling 54.78 per cent stake in Fnac tabled
last month by Altus Finances, a subsidiary of the Credit Lyonnais banking
group, and Phenix, the property company owned by the Generale des Eaux
industrial concern.
Altus and Phenix agreed a deal under which they have an option, until
October 11, to buy the stake from Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires
(GMF), the financial group that owns 80 per cent of Fnac. At FFr2,928 a
share the deal values Fnac at FFr2.4bn.
The option means that GMF, which needs to raise cash to compensate for
losses in other businesses, has until October to find alternative capital,
should it decide to retain control of Fnac.
Fnac, which owns 40 shops in Europe, made net profits of FFr156m on sales of
FFr8.2bn in its last financial year. It dominates the music and books market
in France, where it has been embroiled in a high-profile battle against
Virgin, the UK leisure group which is making inroads into French retailing.
GMF's financial problems were well-publicised and a number of other retail
groups, including Pinault-Printemps in France and Bertelsmann of Germany,
had expressed interest in Fnac before the announcement of the Altus/Phenix
deal.
Mr Francois Pinault, founder of Pinault-Printemps, has since confirmed that
he would still be interested in investing in Fnac.
The Altus/Phenix bid has been put on ice until the COB investigation is
completed. A provisional completion date has been set for early September.
In the meantime, Fnac's shares will remain suspended.

FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dissident shareholder steps up campaign
against Hoskins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of dissident shareholders at Hoskins Brewery, which last week
delayed publication of its full year results, has circulated a letter to the
company's investors in his campaign to oust the chairman and another
director from the board.
The independent brewer of real ales, which is quoted on the USM, said the
announcement of its results had been delayed by difficulties in getting
required consent for publication from one of the directors who was on
holiday in Cornwall.
The results were due out on Friday but are now scheduled for publication
today.
The dissident leader, Mr Richard Holman, who holds a 7.4 per cent stake in
Hoskins, is the second shareholder in two years to challenge the current
board on grounds of its record.
A separate attempt to remove the Hoar brothers from Hoskins' board collapsed
last year when the campaign failed to attract sufficient shareholder
support.
Mr Holman, who claims the support of about 40 per cent of shareholders, has
requisitioned a special meeting at which resolutions will call for his own
appointment to the board and the removal of Mr Barrie Hoar as chairman, and
his brother Mr Robert Hoar, as a direc-tor.
Mr Barrie Hoar, whose family holds 30 per cent of the stock, said he and his
brother would resign when the company's future is secure: 'I hope
shareholders will understand the efforts that we have made in repositioning
the company so that its future can be safe and sound.'
The two had planned to leave the board on the conclusion of a deal with Mr
Adam Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure.
The deal, which involved the injection of some of Mr Page's businesses into
Hoskins, has formally lapsed.

FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Medway bid talks are at advanced stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDWAY PORTS, which recently announced its intention to seek a stock market
flotation next year, confirmed yesterday that 'a number of approaches had
been received which may or may not lead to an offer for the company.'
Potential bidders are thought to include Forth Ports, Mersey Docks and
Powell Duffryn. Medway admitted that discussions with an unamed party -
thought to be Forth - had reached an advanced stage.
Pre-tax profits are likely to reach Pounds 10m this year, which at current
industry valuations would put a potential sale price of Pounds 100m on the
the Sheerness-based group.
Medway, which was bought by its management and employees for Pounds 37m in
March last year, has made no secret of its desire to link up with other port
and shipping groups, and has indicated that in the absence of a merger its
flotation would enable it to make acquisitions.
Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive, said recently: 'If it was a safe pair of
hands, we'd have to look at it very seriously. I see Medway as part of
bigger group in the long term, whether we build it up ourselves by
acquisition or find a partner.'
As the flotation was predicted to raise in the region of Pounds 70m, a sale
at the potentially higher price would result in a windfall for Medway's
270-strong workforce, which was recently granted share options as part of an
incentive scheme.
For the 10 months to December, Medway made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m on
turnover of Pounds 25.2m. In the first six months of this year, pre-tax
profits have jumped to Pounds 4.5m.

FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoping a healthy future will be diagnosed -
The development of Shield Diagnostics, which is to be floated next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIELD Diagnostics, which will be floated on the Stock Exchange next month,
is that rarity among the crop of biotechnology companies that have come to
the market recently: one that already has products on sale.
The Dundee-based company has 23 products for diagnosing illnesses in use
worldwide. Its sales have increased fourfold in each of the past two years,
partly by acquisition, and reached Pounds 1.7m in the year to March 31 1993,
having been Pounds 110,000 in 1991.
The fact that it has been selling products distinguishes it from four of the
five biotechnology companies which have been listed on the Stock Exchange in
the past 14 months: out of British Bio-technology, Tepnel Diagnostics,
Celsis Diagnostics, Anagen and Drew Scientific, only the last is earning
money from its products.
Yet Shield's path to a listing has been no smoother than many other high
technology companies. Founded in 1982 with eight people, it only started
shipping products in 1990, and last year it lost Pounds 653,000, though that
was better than the previous year's deficit of Pounds 1.4m. It is not
expected to break even until 1994.
Shield was created by entrepreneurial scientists from Dundee university and
the city's Ninewells hospital. Its field has always been that of in vitro
diagnostics - the diagnosing of diseases in tests outside the body.
In 1987 Mr Hamish Hale of the venture capital company Alan Patricoff
Associates (now named Apax Partners) became its chairman and Shield, under
new management, raised Pounds 4.5m of venture capital funding.
It built up a strong team of managers by 'cherry-picking' senior staff from
established biomedical companies. But by 1990 it had already spent Pounds 8m
on research and development without bringing any product to the market.
In that year Mr Hale recruited Mr Gordon Hall from Abbot Diagnostics, the
big US diagnostics company, to be chief executive. 'My task was to get some
products out and get the budget under control', says Mr Hall.
His own diagnosis of Shield was that its strength lay in developing and
manufacturing diagnostic discoveries; but it was hampered, like the other
small biotechnology companies, by high fixed overheads.
Although the company soon began marketing a range of kits that test for a
variety of auto-immune diseases, Mr Hall bought in discoveries from other
companies which Shield could manufacture, thus spreading the overheads
burden.
Last year Shield acquired two products from Northumbrian Biologicals, which
added nearly Pounds 700,000 to its turnover. They were a test for chlamydia,
a sexually transmitted, genito-urinary disease which affects women, and for
cytomegalovirus, an agent which can produce infections and for which donated
blood is increasingly being tested worldwide.
'Our products are consistent, which those of some of our small rivals are
not,' says Mr Hall. 'That means they will have the same characteristics in a
year's time as they have today, which makes them a reliable test.'
Shield, he says, is not dependent on the UK's National Health Service, which
he says pays poorly. It exports two-thirds of its output, mostly to
multinational diagnostic companies in the US, Germany and elsewhere.
The company has high hopes for two of the tests which it has under
development. It is perfecting an advanced form of test, based on research by
Oxford university, to enable doctors to predict whether a person is likely
to suffer heart attacks. With Stago of France it has attracted a grant of up
to Pounds 445,000 from the EC's Eureka fund for promising technology.
It hopes the test, already being sold for research purposes, will be on sale
in three years time. 'It's a big market. Already 500m cholesterol tests for
heart disease risk are carried out each year worldwide', Mr Hall says.
Shield has also started work on a test to identify women at risk from the
disease osteoporosis, which causes brittle bones after the age of 45. Mr
Hall points out that there are 12m women aged 45 or over in the UK alone.
The flotation, which should capitalise the company at Pounds 20m, will be a
placing and will raise new equity to fund future development.
The company intends to acquire other companies and buy in new products. It
would like to become the biggest British-owned company in the field of in
vitro diagnostics.
'Obviously we don't expect to go on growing at the same rate as the last two
years,' says Mr Hall, 'but we expect reasonable growth in sales.' More space
at the company's headquarters on the Dundee Technology Park is being
converted from offices to manufacturing. Staff now total 45.
The company is speaking to analysts ahead of next month's flotation, which
is being sponsored by the Glasgow stockbrokers Allied Provincial.
The existing institutional shareholders are expected to stay on board. Led
by Apax, they also include the venture capital funds Cygnus Ventures, Summa
and Grosvenor Ventures. Scottish Enterprise, the successor to the Scottish
Development Agency which helped Shield in its early days, is a small
shareholder.
Shield will come to the market in the same month as Scotia Pharmaceuticals,
the drug company formerly known as Efamol, which concentrates on products
based on fatty acids and funds its research from sales of evening primrose
oil as a dietary supplement.
Though currently based at Guildford in Surrey, Scotia has strong Scottish
connections, manufacturing some of its products at Callanish in the Western
Isles, and may shortly establish a plant in Dundee.
Scotia was founded by Dr David Horrobin 16 years ago. It made pre-tax
profits in 1991-92 of Pounds 1.1m on turnover of Pounds 16m.
Earlier this month dealings in its shares were suspended ahead of the
flotation, details of which have not been disclosed. The shares had traded
at a price which would value the company at more than Pounds 180m.

FISONS has disposed of CP Pharmaceuticals, its Wrexham-based hospital and
generic products subsidiary, to a holding company formed by a management
buy-out team, led by Mr Charles Savage. The price paid was not disclosed.
The company was formed by Fisons from a merger of Charnwood Pharmaceuticals
with Weddell Pharmaceuticals in 1983, and employs about 200 people. Fisons
announced its intention to sell CP Pharmaceuticals last September.
Mr Savage said the company intended to make spare capacity available to
other pharmaceutical companies on a contract manufacturing basis, and would
also be looking to establish strategic alliances with similar companies.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: A government dilemma over labour costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In something as complex as the British government machine it is impossible
to avoid some conflict between different policy objectives. But a
potentially damaging conflict is emerging in a field close to the
government's heart: non-wage labour costs.
These costs have always been relatively low in Britain because healthcare
and much of welfare spending is paid for out of general taxation. Several
continental European countries, by contrast, impose big payroll taxes on
employers and employees.
According to the European Commission, non-wage labour costs add an average
of 30 per cent to employment costs in the EC. The figure approaches 50 per
cent in Germany, France, Italy and Belgium, but is only 13 per cent in
Britain, primarily national insurance.
The government believes that low non-wage labour costs, combined with
relatively light labour regulation, are an important part of the UK's
comparative economic advantage.
The small 'tax' on jobs contributes to a high proportion of adults in work
as well as sucking in a disproportionate level of inward investment.
The 'opt-out' from the Maastricht treaty's social chapter on minimum
employment rights, apparently a policy triumph for prime minster Mr John
Major, was fought for on the grounds that it allowed Britain to hang on to
its low non-wage labour costs.
Yet much of what the government is doing, or planning, runs counter to this
commitment. In the current review of public spending, ministers openly
speculate about transferring welfare costs from the state to individuals and
employers, threatening to send non-wage labour costs climbing.
And, curiously, if more costs were to be transferred to employers, it would
be consistent with what has actually happened over the past 10 years.
In the early 1980s the government abolished the redundancy fund, which
allowed employers to claim back the costs of statutory redundancy pay. In
1991 employers were made responsible for paying 20 per cent of statutory
sick pay benefits.
Just last week the government announced that employers would have to foot
the bill for improvements to maternity pay required by a European directive.
The government also plans to cap the reimbursement employers receive for
employing disabled people and will require employers to deduct child support
payments from recalcitrant fathers. (In the case of the maternity directive
and the disablement cap the government will be creating disincentives to
pursue its own equal opportunities goals.)
The government's response is to point out that most of these burdens are
short-term and inexpensive. The extra maternity payments are, for example,
said to be just 0.02 per cent of Britain's wages bill. The government would
also argue that, thanks to the social chapter opt-out, non-wage labour costs
will be rising from a low base.
But it is the trend that is worrying. According to the government's own
figures, non-wage labour costs have doubled over the past 20 years. And the
administrative burden is often more important than the direct cost. Already
employers have to deal with PAYE for the state and, encouraged by the
government, about half of all employees are in company pension schemes.
These have, until recently, produced great financial benefits for many
companies, but still impose a considerable administrative cost.
'Despite its rhetoric the government seems to be drifting towards the
discredited continental European model of employer-based welfare,' warns Mr
Ira Chalphin of the Institute of Directors.
It is not only employers' organisations which complain about new overheads.
There is a consensus among labour market analysts that shifting the welfare
burden away from employers is good for employment and labour market
flexibility. The latest OECD Employment Outlook says that the financing of
social security systems should switch from payroll taxes to other taxes that
'have a less unfavourable impact on employment'.
Even the European Commission's Employment in Europe report, normally more
sympathetic to continental European labour markets, says that high
employers' contributions encourage the black economy.
There are some things to be said for payroll taxes. From an employee's point
of view they may help to protect welfare payments from the vagaries of
government spending. From an employer's point of view they help to reduce
unwanted labour turnover by locking-in employees.
But that also creates a 'lock-out' effect for the unemployed by increasing
the fixed cost of employment. In any case even in countries with low
statutory payroll costs, employers can provide discretionary benefits such
as private health care and company cars to those employees they want to lock
in.
Several continental European countries are currently trying to unload some
of their payroll taxes on to general taxation. Belgium is trying to reduce
employers' social security contributions in export industries by introducing
a national energy tax and the new French government wants to cut the family
allowances that employers have to pay.
Low non-wage labour costs are vital for Britain's 'work-sharing' economy, in
which part-time employment plays an important role, because employers are
relatively indifferent as to whether they employ a large number of people
for short periods or a smaller number for long periods.
Britain is a low-wage economy compared with France or Germany, but due to
the high level of employment, national income per head is not far behind
those countries. Higher non-wage labour costs would jeopardise that balance.
The UK is not the only highly-indebted government facing a dilemma over
non-wage labour costs. Across the Atlantic the Clinton administration is
facing an even more blatant conflict between its aim of creating a large
number of jobs, and its objective of implementing a national health
insurance programme which would, inevitably, increase the cost of hiring.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Paribas sets up unit for derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Paribas, the French bank, plans to set up a new unit to guarantee its
derivatives business. It will be the first separately capitalised
derivatives unit created by a European bank, following a trend started by
Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers.
Financial institutions with weak credit ratings have found themselves at a
competitive disadvantage to top-rated banks in the highly credit-sensitive
but lucrative derivatives market. The crunch comes when their ratings fall
to single-A, as many firms are limited by internal restrictions to dealing
with credits rated double-A and above. Banque Paribas is rated A1 by Moody's
and A by Standard &amp; Poor's. S&amp;P assigned the new unit a preliminary rating
of triple-A on Friday.
Credit quality is particularly significant in the Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds
2,600bn) over-the-counter market in swaps and options, because exposure to a
counterparty is often over a long period.
The new Paribas unit, Paribas Derives Garantis SNC, is 99.9 per cent owned
by Compagnie Financiere de Paribas. The unit will act as a guarantor, rather
than a counterparty. Paribas said the structure had been chosen to allow
clients to continue to deal with Banque Paribas, a regulated bank. The
Commission Bancaire, the French bank regulator, has approved the structure.
The initial amount of capital backing the unit is FFr800m (Pounds 90.5m).
The total capital will be adjusted regularly according to the commitments of
PDG.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Aluminium fence goes up around Europe: Kenneth Gooding
considers the response of continental producers to rising exports from the
CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many Russians, Mr Igor Prokopov can become emotional at times. And he
gets noticeably cross when anyone suggests that the Commonwealth of
Independent States is entirely responsible for bringing the western
aluminium industry to its knees.
There has been an unprecedented surge in CIS aluminium exports, which
European producers say has depressed the price to a point where their
industry is on the verge of collapse.
But Mr Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy, holding company for the CIS
industry, points out that aluminium is a world commodity and there is only
one market - a world market. The CIS is an important member of that market
and the rest of the industry will have to adjust to that.
Japan once was a big aluminium producer, he recalls, but now makes virtually
none. The Japanese were forced out in the early 1980s because their costs
were too high, particularly their energy costs. Nobody blamed the CIS
producers for that, so why blame them now? Mr Prokopov says most CIS
smelters use low-cost hydro-electric power, as do smelters in Latin America
and Canada. It is not their fault if smelters in central Europe have to buy
relatively expensive energy, making them high-cost producers.
Mr Prokopov becomes particularly agitated at suggestions that the CIS is
dumping aluminium in the west. How can this be, he asks, when all official
CIS contracts are linked to the world price set by the London Metal Exchange
and most of the export is handled by reputable western trading companies?
His spirited defence cuts little ice with the European Commission, which
last week imposed restrictions on CIS aluminium imports, insisting that only
60,000 tonnes may be imported between now and the end of November - about
half of what might otherwise have been expected.
Mr Prokopov says this makes no sense. Putting a fence between Europe and the
CIS will not work - the metal is a global commodity that will simply enter
the world market elsewhere. The restrictions make even less political sense
when the world's industrialised countries are dismantling trade barriers and
attempting to help the CIS transform to a market economy.
Western analysts suggest that the CIS produced about 2.7m tonnes of
aluminium last year, down from 2.9m tonnes in 1991. It exported about 1m
tonnes, of which nearly 600,000 tonnes went to other parts of Europe. At the
end of the 1980s the former Soviet Union was exporting only 200,000 tonnes,
of which 124,000 tonnes went to western Europe.
Even though chaotic conditions in the CIS cut demand for aluminium from 2.6m
to 1.8m tonnes last year, there were still shortages of the metal. The fish
canning industries in Russia and the Ukraine complain that there is not
enough available. Among other things, the metal is also used for canning
caviar, one of the few Russian products that has instant appeal in overseas
markets.
Aluminium has that same appeal. Russia and some other parts of the CIS can
produce top-quality aluminium - much of it used to go into military and
aerospace equipment - which is readily convertible into dollars.
Smelter managers prefer to export to earn dollars instead of being paid by
domestic customers in rapidly depreciating roubles. Their smelters are not
just making metal - they provide the sole support for whole communities,
including schools and hospitals. Dollars earned provide food, medicine and
school books, not just raw materials and smelter equipment.
Concern Aluminiy estimates that between Dollars 250m and Dollars 300m
(Pounds 201m) a year raised from aluminium exports is spent by the industry
in the EC.
Nevertheless, the Commission has responded to pleas for protection from
European producers who claim that CIS imports have depressed aluminium
prices to their lowest-ever level in real terms and to a point where some
smelters are not earning enough to cover cash production costs.
The European industry has been forced to make expensive production cuts  -
80 per cent of the 1.1m tonnes of western capacity cut so far is in Europe.
Part of the Commission's explanation for its action was: 'Aluminium produced
in CIS states enjoys the huge advantage of artificially low energy prices
and environmental standards that are far less strict than those in western
countries.'
Nobody disputes that environmental standards in CIS smelters are appalling.
If Russia's own regulations were imposed, all its smelters would close down.
A team from the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) discovered that
conditions were so poor in some Russian smelters that a worker's average
life expectancy was only 47 years.
The European industry wonders if it makes any sense to close relatively
modern smelters in the west to allow the CIS monsters to continue operating.
As for costs, the Russians claim they produce aluminium at about Dollars 500
a tonne. But energy costs are heavily subsidised and labour rates range from
one US cent to two cents a lb - less than those in most developing
countries.
Industry consultant Mr Anthony Bird estimates that, aided by these
'astonishingly low' input prices, CIS smelters in mid-1992 were producing
aluminium for about 25 US cents a lb - well below the 53.6 cents average at
smelters in the rest of the world. But by the year 2000 only one or two
smelters would still be competitive if the CIS continued to move towards a
market economy.
The western industry says it cannot wait that long for relief. However, it
is split about what action should be taken.
Until last week US producers were not asking for protection - but said the
EC action might force them to do so. Mr Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, in
June tried to head off restrictions by the EC: he announced that Alcoa, even
though it had some of the world's lowest-cost smelters, would cut its output
by 25 per cent at the cost of 750 jobs. He also called on governments to
find 'a mechanism to deal with the economic consequences of the dissolution
of the former Soviet Union.'
The EC, too, is seeking a multilateral solution. It is willing to assist in
the modernisation of CIS smelters and wants to encourage the regeneration of
CIS domestic demand for aluminium.
The western industry has already taken some tentative steps in this
direction. But, by imposing restrictions, the Commission obviously hopes to
grab the attention of Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, so that, in
spite of all his other problems, he will move those besetting the aluminium
industry nearer the top of his agenda.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Nadir was offered chance to control RHM: An acquisition plan
just come to light that would have made Polly Peck 'the bakers to Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the best-known brands on Britain's supermarket shelves might have
passed to Mr Asil Nadir if an audacious plan for control of one of the
country's largest food producers had not foundered three years ago.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Nadir, the fugitive businessman who earlier
this year illegally fled bail for northern Cyprus facing charges of theft
and false accounting, was offered the chance to take a substantial stake in
Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM), the milling and baking group, in spring 1990.
RHM, which was bought by the conglomerate Tomkins last December, produces
goods such as Mr Kipling cakes, Mother's Pride bread, Bisto gravy and
Rombouts coffee.
Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, offered his 29.9 per cent
stake in the group to Mr Nadir on behalf of Polly Peck International, which
entered administration in October 1990. Polly Peck's acquisitive growth in
the 1980s brought it brands such as Del Monte, the fresh fruit business, and
Sansui, the Tokyo-quoted electronics company.
Sir James visited Mr Nadir with Mr Jim Slater, the one-time stock market
guru and entrepreneur. The two men offered Mr Nadir the stake in RHM which
was then owned by Sunningdale Holdings, a vehicle controlled by Sir James,
Lord Rothschild and Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media entrepreneur.
The RHM shares were originally bought for 400p each in May 1989 after a
takeover bid launched by Goodman Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group,
lapsed the previous year following a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. The stake was offered to Lord Hanson, but ultimately sold at a
loss at the end of January 1991 at just 300p a share.
The shares would have offered the chance for a takeover bid and given
considerable influence with the board to Mr Nadir. It would have directly
given him the power to block extraordinary resolutions, which require the
support of 75 per cent of shareholders.
Senior executives of Polly Peck at the time say that Mr Nadir was very
excited by the RHM offer and particularly the prospect of acquiring the
company's brands.
According to one, he said: 'We will be the bakers to Europe.' He said Sir
James and Mr Slater had told him he was the 'only person in England' who
could take over RHM.
Credit Suisse First Boston was commissioned to consider the acquisition. If
it had gone ahead, the plan was to sell off the branded businesses and
retain the baking operations. But the offer was ultimately rejected because
of difficulties in raising the finance, the complexity of RHM, insufficient
management capacity at Polly Peck and Mr Nadir's realisation that he would
have had to make a hostile bid.
During summer 1990, Polly Peck also came close to offering Pounds 250m for
International Leisure Group, the owner of Air Europe and Intasun which
collapsed in March 1991. Polly Peck was approached by Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, which had been asked by ILG to find a partner as its
financial position worsened. It also approached Lonrho, the international
trading group.
According to former directors, Polly Peck rejected the ILG offer because of
substantial potential liabilities on leased aircraft and difficulties in
raising the money. Mr Nadir was interested in the airline for flying
tourists to his hotels in the near East and to combine with Noble Air, the
airline then controlled by his sister.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Emu may cost jobs, says study: European Commission paper
warns large scale aid will be needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN monetary union could cause a substantial rise in unemployment,
according to an internal European Commission study which was considered too
critical to be published.
The report said larger scale regional aid would be needed within the EC to
tackle unemployment in uncompetitive areas after the introduction of Emu.
The study, on the employment effects of monetary union, was produced last
year for the then social affairs commissioner, Ms Vasso Papandreou.
Although the commission, and DG 5, the social affairs directorate, are still
committed to the Emu timetable, a number of officials in DG 5 have privately
welcomed the likely delay of Emu and even the recent loosening of the
exchange rate mechanism. 'Quite a few of us here are highly relieved that
Emu looks as if it has been held up, given the sort of impact it could have
on employment,' said one.
Some of Europe's main trade union centres, which have considerable influence
in DG 5, are also starting to review their support for Emu. The European
Trades Union Congress still backs Emu, but Britain's TUC, for example,
openly expresses doubts about when it can be implemented and which countries
should qualify. The commission study says Emu will require greater regional
transfers than those currently planned. Without such transfers a high degree
of national fiscal flexibility will be needed if growth and employment are
not to be adversely affected.
It warns: 'The removal of the possibility of exchange rate adjustment when
full monetary union is established will eliminate a major means of
correcting supply imbalances across the Community and of restoring the
competitiveness of particular countries or regions which suffer losses in
trade shares.
'But the Maastricht treaty seems to rule out fiscal flexibility and to
insist instead on compliance with the arbitrary ceilings imposed on budget
deficits and government debt.'
Doubts about the employment impact of Emu are commonplace outside the
commission but still highly controversial inside.
DG 5 has been dominated by French officials who have not wavered in their
support for monetary union or the social chapter. But the combination of a
new commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn of Ireland, a centre-right government in
France, and an emphasis on competitiveness, has led DG 5 to take more
interest in labour market flexibility.

FT  16 AUG 93 / British Gas likely to escape break-up in MMC report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is expected to escape a recommended break-up in the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission report due to be released tomorrow.
However, the report is likely to call for a more transparent structure to
the giant gas company and the phased removal of its monopoly of the tariff
market for households and small businesses.
A second report will also recommend a rate of return for British Gas's
pipeline and storage business, setting the stage for greater competition by
new entrants into the gas market.
The contents of the two long-awaited reports have remained closely guarded
since they were delivered by the MMC to the Department of Trade and Industry
and Ofgas, the industry regulator, two weeks ago. Even British Gas has only
seen part of the reports. It will receive both today, ahead of tomorrow's
publication.
Unusually, the MMC is expected to make a statement about the reports
tomorrow. This is because of the complications caused by the four separate
monopoly references which triggered the reports, and the fact that they are
being released before the government has had the opportunity to decide what
action to take.
The DTI will be issuing the reports without comment. Ministers intend to
study them for some weeks before deciding whether to accept their
recommendations. Ofgas will have to decide whether to implement the
recommendations for the pipeline and storage business, though it has already
agreed to coordinate any action with the DTI. This will mean further
uncertainty for British Gas which has been resisting a possible break-up.
The expectation that the MMC's recommendations will be less severe on
British Gas than originally expected helped drive the company's share price
up 25p to 333p last week, a record high.
Mr Michael Sayers, gas industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, said: 'I am not
expecting the MMC to recommend a full scale break-up of British Gas. But I
do think there will be a move towards complete accounting separation of the
transport and storage business.'
British Gas's competitors hope the MMC will recommend lowering the threshold
for entry into the tariff market. At the moment, British Gas has a monopoly
of all customers who use less than 2,500 therms a year, the majority of gas
consumers.

FT  16 AUG 93 / UK minister wants world social charter on employment rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, has called for a world social
charter of minimum employment rights to supersede the European Community's
own social chapter.
Mr Hunt, who proposed the idea privately to Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC social
affairs commissioner, said it was 'ludicrous' for EC countries to introduce
extra non-wage labour costs through the EC social chapter when they had to
compete in world markets.
But he also believed there is a case for some basic level of employment
protection which all countries, including developing countries, would have
to observe.
'Instead of imposing costs on ourselves we would be better served pursuing
the idea of a world social charter,' he said.
'I would like to see such a charter concentrating particularly on basic
health and safety standards.'
Although improved world labour regulation is under scrutiny in several
countries which fear the competitive threat from low-wage south-east Asian
countries, the idea of a world social charter is unlikely to find favour
with all Mr Hunt's cabinet colleagues.
The idea, which is sometimes proposed in the form of a social clause in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has been discussed in France and
even the US, but is usually pushed hardest by international trade union
bodies.
On the wider issue of Europe, Mr Hunt said few of the divisions in the
Conservative party over Maastricht were a result of hard policy differences.
There is now, he said, 'a great deal to unite around on Europe'.
He will have pleased his more orthodox colleagues by stressing his support
for the government's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty and by pledging to resist any imposition of EC employment directives
through the back door.
He also wants a competitiveness test to be applied to all new EC measures
and says other EC countries are now far more willing to accept such British
initiatives.
Mr Hunt also hinted that he would not be seeking another round of employment
laws to follow the latest tranche of legislation. 'In the meetings I have
had with unions and employers' organisations, the message that comes across
is that there should be time for reflection and consolidation,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent surge in British Gas's shares looks a little odd since the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's verdict on the company's fate is due to
be unveiled tomorrow. Admittedly, that doom is not binding - the Department
of Trade and Industry has yet to pronounce. In a market powered by hopes of
lower interest rates and the search for yield Gas's dividend looks
attractive. Still, the risks will not be clear until the report is
published, and the MMC has a reputation for surprises.
The main areas of concern are the structure of the industry, the rate of
return British Gas is allowed to earn on its pipeline, and the abolition of
the company's monopoly of the domestic market. A full break-up of the
company looks improbable, but the MMC may insist that its operations are
split into separate subsidiary companies, increasing overhead costs. Gas's
pipeline returns seem unlikely to be increased substantially, but a higher
rate may be allowed on new investment. Abolition of the domestic monopoly is
definitely on the cards, though that may be phased over a period of years.
None of which will do much to improve the company's financial prospects.
Non-regulated exploration and production activities will start to generate
substantial cash by the mid-1990s, yet much of that will be needed to
replace and expand reserves. Since British Gas wants its dividend to be
covered twice, the attractive yield is unlikely to be fattened by hefty
dividend rises. Those who have bought ahead of the news will have to hope
they have read the MMC correctly.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The marketing strategies being pursued by branded goods companies may not be
a mortal blow for hard-pressed advertising agencies. Mr Charles Scott, chief
executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, acknowledged last week that discounting of
branded goods would suck money out of advertising budgets in the short term.
But pioneers of everyday low pricing such as Procter &amp; Gamble have pledged
that advertising support for their brands will not be reduced overall. The
remaining price differential of branded goods over generic products would
otherwise be impossible to defend.
Yet the outlook for advertising agencies is far from cloudless. While
advertising expenditure should grow as the industrial economies turn, the
stratospheric rate of growth seen in the 1980s - with advertising growing
steadily as a proportion of gross domestic product - is improbable.
The wild card is the question of brand valuations in company accounts. A
recent study commissioned by the UK Accounting Standards Board supported
balance sheet valuation of acquired brands, subject to certain financial
tests. If that approach is carried through into an accounting standard,
consumer goods companies will have a financial incentive to maintain
advertising investment in their brands. Agencies would doubtless applaud
such an approach. Still, having written off Pounds 600m of goodwill to
reflect a permanent diminution in value of acquired agency brands, Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi will also appreciate the pitfalls.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rising equity market has contributed more to the recapitalisation of the
UK insurance industry than the stream of rights calls and preference share
issues. Most composite insurers maintain equity portfolios at least equal to
shareholders' funds. For Sun Alliance, the most geared to equities, the 25
per cent rise in the stock market since sterling's devaluation may have
added Pounds 500m to its capital base. The exception is Royal, which holds
equities equal only to around half shareholders' funds.
So far Royal's shares have not been held back by its gilts and other fixed
interest investments. It roundly outperformed the sector over the last 12
months as underwriting conditions have turned. With the UK underwriting
recovery now fully in the price, though, differences of investment mix are
more likely to tell. The question for shareholders and management alike is
whether the likely outperformance of equities over the long term is worth
the additional risk.
Another bull equity market in the 1990s would most likely leave UK insurers
overcapitalised. Very high solvency ratios are a hurdle to making a decent
return on capital, however good the investment returns. Insurance companies
riding a rising equity market also feel little pressure to make decent
underwriting profits. That partly explains the extent of insurance losses
during the last three years. Direct Line, the darling of the insurance
industry, both makes an underwriting profit and holds its assets wholly in
bonds and cash.

Having spent a vast quantity of the Bundesbank's D-Marks in its futile
attempt to defend the franc, the French government now faces the
embarrassment of repaying the loan. Although the Germans are unlikely to
send in the bailiffs, the French are theoretically obliged to return the
money within three months. The difficulty could be partly eased by rolling
over some of the loan for a further 90 days. If the franc appears reasonably
stable, the Bank of France might gingerly sell francs on the currency
markets to recoup the D-Marks, as it successfully did after earlier crises.
But the sheer scale of the FFr180bn foreign currency reserve deficit
suggests more urgent action will be required. The deficit leaves the French
largely denuded should the franc again come under attack. Capital controls
may provide one means of defence, although this is hardly in keeping with
the single European market. In any event the French government will want to
raise fresh finance for future contingencies as well as repay the D-Marks it
owes.
Given the size of the funding task, the French will have to raise the money
through a variety of channels. The Bank of France may reluctantly sell some
gold reserves. The government may borrow some money in the syndicated loan
market, but this is relatively expensive. It may also issue domestic OAT
bonds and swap them into D-Marks, yet the franc swaps market has limited
liquidity. In the end the French may be forced to the cheapest course.
Foreign currency bonds are the most sensible way to borrow, however much the
government dislikes them.

No wonder President Bill Clinton is taking so long filling the empty posts
in his administration. Shirley Chater, President Clinton's candidate to head
the Social Security Administration, seems to be running into some difficulty
after admitting that she failed to pay social security taxes for her
part-time teenage babysitters between 1969 and 1975.
It might sound a terrible crime to non-Americans but on the scale of US tax
evasion it is not worth mentioning. Indeed, if this litmus test were used to
bar all candidates for high office then the US administration might have to
consider importing candidates from abroad.

Talk about hard luck tales. There is a real humdinger in the latest issue of
The Antique Collector where the new Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother,
outlines 'the worst year of my life'.
The Earl inherited a family business which was losing Pounds 450,000 a year
when he took over. 'Every time I wake up in a cold sweat from the worry of
it all, I just think how empty my life would be without the challenge of
fighting for the survival of this lumbering endangered species.' Apparently,
he is talking about the family pile - 13,000 acres plus stately home -
rather than the family itself.
But it is not all the fault of the Earl's late father or his spendthrift
stepmother, Raine. 'My family has always sold the wrong thing,' says the
29-year-old Earl. His grandfather flogged a Holbein to Baron Thyssen for
Pounds 10,000 and now it's worth Pounds 55m. Worse still a great-great uncle
sold three villages in the 1830s. Unfortunately, they happened to be
Clapham, Wandsworth and Wimbledon.

Now that Business Week magazine has proclaimed George Soros as the 'most
powerful and successful investor in the world', it's hard to believe that he
will ever have to wait again for an appointment.
However, Observer hears that in the past the man who moves markets and
terrifies central bankers has occasionally had to wait his turn. Soros, who
has donated a lot of money to fund higher education in eastern Europe, has
been making several trips to Oxford to talk to academics and often arrives
before student tutorials are finished.
But rather than use the time to check on the fate of the latest currency in
his sights, or pen another Op-Ed piece, the world's greatest financier has
taken to sitting in the porter's lodge of Holywell Manor, Balliol's graduate
centre, and watching cricket. Just goes to show that it never pays to
under-estimate the college porter.

But don't be put off by the jargon. It is simpler than it sounds. Just
answer the following five questions: Where have I been? Where am I now?
Where do I want to go? How will I get there? How will I know if I have
arrived?
Answer at least three of these questions correctly, promise to pay Pounds

FT  16 AUG 93 / Back to work a speedier way: The EC is seeking to redress
the balance between worker protection and labour market flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a Spanish businessman has a profitable year he does not invest in plant
and equipment to expand his business and create jobs. Instead, he puts money
aside to cover the cost of sacking workers when the market wanes.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, sometimes tells this story to
businessmen to illustrate how the high costs of labour protection have
contributed to his country's unemployment level of 22 per cent, the highest
in the European Community.
For the leader of a socialist government to suggest reducing labour
protection as a key to job creation is indicative of a new openness in the
EC unemployment debate - which has spread to the European Commission as it
prepares a study of the link between jobs and competitiveness.
The Commission is examining whether the high cost of employment and high
protection of European workers is one reason why so few people have jobs.
Only 60 per cent of people of working age have jobs, compared with 75 per
cent plus in the US and Japan, and half of Europe's 17m unemployed have been
without work for more than one year.
While the Commission is not considering abandoning its commitment to minimum
employment rights as enshrined in the social chapter, an increasing number
of officials are searching for a new balance between protection and
deregulation. 'Relaxing the rules governing hiring and firing is not the
only answer but some countries do need to loosen up a lot more,' says a
senior Commission official.
For the past decade, much of the EC has been experiencing growth virtually
without any net increase in jobs. Even countries which have had above
average growth, such as France, Italy and Ireland, have seen no significant
increase in employment. Given the gradual increase in female workforce
participation, the Commission estimates that merely to reduce unemployment
from 11 per cent to 7 per cent requires the creation of 10m jobs before
2000.
The rise in EC unemployment since the early 1970s has as many causes as
there are countries. There are also significant differences between
countries in the way that unemployment is counted. In Spain only those on
the unemployment register qualify for free health care, thereby inflating
the jobless figure.
Nevertheless, EC countries do share several problems and could learn from
each other's experiences in trying to tackle them.
Debate across Europe is now focused on four main areas of reform:
The high costs of firing and the restrictions on part-time and temporary
work. It may seem perverse to make it easier to fire people when the aim is
to increase employment levels. But in increasingly open and competitive
markets, employers, large and small, will only hire if they know they can
fire when the going gets tough.
The average cost of firing someone in the EC is 22 weeks' pay (26 weeks for
white-collar workers and 16 for blue-collar), and most countries require
statutory consultation with unions or the state. Denmark, Ireland and the UK
have fewest restrictions; Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and the Netherlands
have the greatest; Belgium, France and Germany lie in between.
Many southern European states with their low workforce participation rates
and high long-term unemployment illustrate the point that the more
regulation there is to protect full-time jobs, the fewer employers will
offer.
'The legacy of regulation in southern Europe stems from a time when product
markets too were highly regulated, but with the liberalisation of markets
the full-time employment guarantee has to be loosened too,' says Mr David
Grubb, a labour market expert at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development.
Spain and Italy, where it can cost more than two years' pay to sack someone
from a large company, are in the process of cutting that amount and making
the negotiating period shorter.
There has also been some reform of the tight regulations that southern
European countries have inherited governing part-time and temporary work. In
France and Spain, where temporary contract work was liberalised in the
1980s, more than half the long-term unemployed found part-time work. In
Spain, nearly 40 per cent of all employees are now on temporary contracts
compared with an EC average of 9 per cent.
Some labour market economists argue that increasing part-time work does not
increase employment overall but repackages a given number of full-time jobs
into a larger number of insecure part-time or temporary ones. This argument
still finds strong support in Italy, which has the least part-time and
temporary work in the EC, and which until last month banned private
employment agencies such as Manpower.
It may, indeed, be undesirable to allow temporary work to reach the level it
has in Spain, where the government is now offering employers subsidies to
convert temporary jobs into permanent ones. But the evidence from France and
the Netherlands shows that part-time and temporary jobs are a useful way for
employers to test out employees and that they can often lead to full-time
jobs.
The relatively high cost of labour and, in particular, the burden of high
payroll taxes. One of the most straightforward reasons for the EC's inferior
performance on job creation compared with the US and Japan is pay. The pay
of EC workers increased at an average of 4 per cent a year in real terms
during the 1980s while in the US and Japan it was virtually static.
The French government has just come up with a novel scheme to offer
subsidies to companies where the workers take a cut in real wages to
preserve jobs; but it is difficult, in the short-term, for governments to
have a direct impact on wage bargaining.
They can more easily do something about the high health and social security
contributions paid by employers, as well as reducing their own role in wage
setting. The Italian government, for example, has recently abolished the
Scala Mobile which linked pay rises to inflation, while the French minimum
wage scheme which, according to many studies, has reduced youth employment,
is gradually being phased out.
Payroll taxes on employers, which add on average 30 per cent to the EC's
wage costs, are coming under scrutiny everywhere. In Denmark the payroll
addition is only 3 per cent and in the UK 13 per cent, but in France, Italy
and Belgium the average figure is 45 per cent and often much more for higher
paid employees.
'For historical reasons some countries loaded a large part of the social
security burden on employers - there was no other way to collect the
revenue,' says Mr Peter Burgess of UK pay analysts Incomes Data Services.
But the burdens on employers are increasing, not diminishing, the spread of
informal employment in many EC countries, especially Spain, Greece and
Italy.
Few recession-hit European governments are in a position to carry the burden
of payroll taxes themselves. But the Belgian government is trying to reduce
the social security contributions of employers in export industries by
introducing a national energy tax, and the French government intends to cut
employers' contributions to family allowances.
As UK ministers point out, the model for many reforms is the low payroll
tax, easier hire and fire, British labour market. For the
low-productivity/low-wage economies of southern Europe the UK may hold
lessons. Arguably, the UK has developed a highly deregulated labour market
because of its historically open-market economy. Southern European countries
have tended to mimic this pattern since joining the EC, and their once
highly regulated labour markets are following suit. UK-style flexibility can
also offset disadvantages such as poor education and training and low labour
mobility, which beset the southern countries
However, the British way is less relevant to the high pay and high
productivity northern European countries, according to Mr Terry Ward, an
economic adviser to the European Commission. In the Netherlands and Germany,
long-term employer-employee commitments at the workplace and centralised pay
bargaining, plus the regulations which accompany them, may have contributed
to their high value-added economies. While employment in the UK has been
riding a roller-coaster - up in the late 1980s and down in the early 1990s -
the three countries with the lowest unemployment - the Netherlands, west
Germany, and Luxembourg - have all been severely regulated.
The low labour-intensity of the service sector. With unemployment rising
fast in most northern countries, there is still a case for targeted
deregulation, especially in the service sector, which is much less labour
intensive in the EC than in Japan or the US. Unless the service sector can
absorb the jobs lost in manufacturing, Germany could face persistent
structural unemployment, as a result of unification and competitive
adjustment. Loosening the regulations governing some jobs - for instance,
electricity repairmen and other domestic service providers - could lead to
job creation.
'We have cut ourselves off from many of the labour-intensive service sector
jobs in Europe by importing immigrants to do them. You just have to compare
refuse collection in France, where it is a low status job done by
immigrants, with the same job in Sweden, where it is dignified and well
paid,' says Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of Unice, the European employers'
body.
More efficient targeting of state aid and active labour market policies. The
OECD says there can still be an important role for the state through active
measures such as spending on training the unemployed, and on financial
support for job-sharing.
The Dutch government has led the way on job-sharing by insisting that all
new employees in the public sector are limited to a 32-hour week. The
Belgian government has just agreed that workers over 55 can work half time,
receiving a mixture of pay and pension, thereby releasing jobs for the
unemployed.
The UK government has abandoned incentives, introduced in the early 1980s,
for public sector employees to split jobs, and has been suspicious of wage
subsidies, a relatively inefficient form of job creation. But as the country
with the highest overtime in the EC, the UK could examine how to convert
some of the overtime into new jobs without upsetting low-paid employees who
need the extra money.
Where labour policy activism is higher, long-term unemployment tends to be
lower, according to some labour market economists. For example, compulsory
interviews and counselling for the long-term unemployed have had positive
results in Britain and France, where nearly 30 per cent of those interviewed
found either a job or a training place. Job clubs, self-help clubs for the
unemployed, have also been a successful British innovation now being copied
in Portugal.
An examination of different responses to long-term unemployment in the EC,
under the Ergo programme, concluded recently that the creation of businesses
and the encouragement of self-employment was more worthwhile than
'make-work' schemes - which may come as a surprise to some member states. It
also found that counselling measures were the most cost-effective means of
getting people back to work.
Counselling is particularly effective in those EC countries where
unemployment benefits do not run out after a period of time. Such open-ended
benefits, unless carefully designed, can throw up a web of disincentives to
work, especially in part-time and temporary jobs. Some people can be
dissuaded from taking jobs by the high initial cost of giving up their
benefits, and they need 'back to work' grants to bridge the gap, as in
Japan.
Getting Europe back to work requires more than renewed economic growth. No
EC government wants to emulate the harsher aspects of the US labour market,
where two-thirds of employed workers are subject to instant dismissal and
far fewer unemployed workers than in Europe qualify for benefits. But all
the signs are that the trend of the 1980s towards deregulation is picking up
speed. Governments as well as Brussels have grasped the importance of labour
market reform and are groping towards a new balance between employment
protection and flexibility.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Economics in the new Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 40 years of Liberal Democratic party domination, Japan's economy, as
well as its politics, is unlikely ever to look quite the same again. The
seven-party coalition government, gratefully grasping the reins of power and
with the possibility of a second election not too far ahead, has every
incentive to change the rules of the economic as well as the political game.
For years, US governments have been demanding a shift in Japanese government
and household behaviour from saving towards consumption, in order to reduce
Japan's trade surplus. Now, independent of US pressure, the change in
underlying economic and political circumstances may be about to deliver the
fall in Japanese national saving and the trade surplus that the US has long
desired.
What will drive a reduction in the trade deficit is the strong rally in the
value of the Japanese exchange rate which has occurred over the past month.
The yen has appreciated by 22 per cent against the US dollar since the
beginning of the year, and by 15 per cent since the election in mid-July.
For the moment, the combination of the yen appreciation and depressed demand
for imports means that the dollar value of the trade surplus is still
rising. But the yen rally will inevitably bite into the competitiveness of
Japanese exporters. Export volume growth is already slowing.
Still, the pace at which the trade deficit falls will depend on how fast
imports rise and thus on the strength of domestic demand over the coming
year. The economy's recent hiccups, the political outlook and the changing
power balance between the politicians and the bureaucracy all point to the
possibility of a faster recovery than would otherwise have been the case.
A cut in interest rates by the Bank of Japan would be the most effective way
to revive Japan's still sluggish economy. If the government is really
worried, an easier monetary policy would also be the most effective way to
stem the rise in the yen. But the stimulus is more likely to come from
another fiscal package in the second half of this year.
The Ministry of Finance will fight hard to resist the income tax cuts that
the new government appears to favour. The risk is that, despite the
opposition of the bureaucrats, a weak coalition will rush to buy the support
of voters through profligate fiscal policy. But even if it is still
sufficiently powerful to prevail on tax cuts, the ministry will have to
sanction some form of fiscal loosening.
Yet the most significant fiscal policy changes are likely to be those which
encourage a fall in private, rather than government, saving. Japan's
households have traditionally been big savers only partly because they
wanted to save. The web of taxes and regulations that the LDP spun to
attract its rural constituencies also made consumption difficult and
expensive for urban dwellers. In the new world of Japanese politics, the
re-drawing of constituency boundaries, the re-balancing of representation
towards urban areas and the apparent decline in political support for the
Socialist party all make the interests and concerns of urban voters much
more important than before.
The government thus has an opportunity to remove many of the distortions -
particularly concerning the ownership, use and transfer of land - which have
traditionally impeded consumption and contributed to the emergence of trade
and financial imbalances over the past decade. By removing the disincentive
to private consumption, while keeping a tight grip on fiscal policy in the
medium term, the new government could also reduce the trade deficit and
achieve a permanent improvement in US economic relations. US administration
officials, however impatient for signs of short-term fiscal policy activism,
would be wise to sit on their hands and see what develops.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Leading Article: In the pit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER PIT closures have been inevitable ever since the UK government gave
a stay of execution to 12 of the pits on British Coal's original hit-list
earlier this year. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
could not say so at the time, such was the political uproar that greeted
last year's closure programme. The government may not feel able to say so
now, although the news that British Coal wants to close an even larger
number of pits has been leaked. But the harsh truth is that March's white
paper did not provide a rescue, only a reprieve.
Coal is a dirty and expensive form of generating electricity and is
therefore being inexorably driven out of the market by cheaper and cleaner
gas. The white paper failed to guarantee a larger market for coal by
elbowing aside other forms of energy. It merely promised subsidies to bring
the price of British-mined coal down to world market levels if any extra
market could be found.
But it has become abundantly clear that the main generators, National Power
and PowerGen, are not willing to buy more coal for the time being. They have
already stockpiled far more coal than they want, and have no immediate need
of any extra supplies on top of what they have already contracted to take.
Even if they sign up for more from next year, the amounts will be small.
Meanwhile, the prospects for UK coal have further deteriorated. Partly to
blame is the government's decision to allow generators to burn more
orimulsion, an even dirtier but cheaper form of fuel than coal. But the
reprieve of the 12 pits has also played a part. It has resulted in British
Coal building its own 14m tonne stockpile of unsold coal. The larger the
coal mountains above ground, the more pointless it is to dig for coal
underground.
There will be some who think that the government should re-explore options
discarded in the white paper such as banning new gas-fired power stations,
closing nuclear plants and halting imports of French electricity. But
changing the energy market in such ways would impose higher electricity
costs on British businesses and consumers.
The only sensible way forward is to press ahead with privatisation, in the
hope that a small but efficient industry will emerge. In doing so, ministers
will need to consider carefully whether British Coal should be broken into
competing companies. Although this would give a spur to productivity, there
may be something in the counter-argument that the generating duopoly would
find it too easy to dictate terms to an excessively fragmented industry.
As far as pit closures are concerned, there is an economic case for an open
announcement that another 15 or so pits will have to go. Prolonging the
agony would be debilitating for those who work in the industry. By adding to
the coal stockpiles, it would also undermine the industry's remaining
chances of long-run viability. But politics will presumably dictate
otherwise.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Insurance crunch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE rest of the UK financial services industry has been subjected to
painful structural change over the past decade, the life assurance sector
has enjoyed a relatively trouble-free existence. Since the introduction of
the 1986 Financial Services Act, the commissions it charges to policyholders
have actually gone up, and the cost base of much of the industry has also
risen against the wider financial services trend.
There are now good grounds for thinking that the 1990s will see a profits
crunch in life assurance. One pointer is the recent decision by the
chancellor of the exchequer to call for a regulatory regime that demands
improved disclosure of commissions, and thus a more effective form of
competition. Another is the decision announced last week by the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society to stop selling endowment mortgages and to sever
its distribution link with Legal &amp; General.
For Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, this represents a simultaneous retreat from
financial conglomeration and from a commitment to a product with which the
public is understandably disenchanted. A return to repayment and
interest-only mortgages is only possible because the society has a
sufficiently low cost base to do without commission fees from Legal &amp;
General on endowment policies.
For medium-sized players in the retail financial services business, the name
of the game in future will be to focus on those products that will retain
their appeal in an improved-disclosure environment and to do so on the basis
of the lowest possible cost. The inefficient will be weeded out, though the
shock will be made less severe by the fact that a large number of mutual
insurers enjoy a protected form of ownership. But there will be no escape
from competitive pressure in the product market itself. The more efficient
practitioners will anticipate it by positioning themselves in advance.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Right tax option for President
Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SARVJEET GARCHA and Mr ROBIN D NUTTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is misleading to argue ('Mr Clinton's Tax Deal', August 9) that
labour taxes reduce employment any more than value-added consumption taxes.
A rise in either form of taxation reduces the purchasing power of labour
income, and thereby has an equivalent impact upon wage demands. Consequently
the detrimental effect upon employment is the same, unless you believe that
workers are stupid - not being able to realise that a rise in the price of
consumption goods means they can buy less of them.
To assume so would be inconsistent for a newspaper that was arguing as
recently as last year that devaluation would have no lasting effects on
competitiveness and employment - on the grounds that workers would simply
demand higher wages to compensate for increased import prices.
Moreover, an increase in labour taxes can be focused on the rich whereas an
increase in consumption taxes cannot. Thus, if the higher tax revenue in the
US is to be met by the rich it is to labour taxes, not value-added taxes,
that Clinton must turn.

FT  16 AUG 93 / The case against redistribution: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's budget raises an age-old philosophical question: to
what extent is state-mandated redistribution from the rich to the rest of
society justified? The administration has imposed one of the biggest tax
increases in US history (nearly Dollars 250bn over five years) yet boasts
that only the top 1 per cent or so of taxpayers will face any increase in
income tax. Some 80 per cent of the burden will supposedly be borne by
families with incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more.
Such an extraordinary emphasis on redistribution has few historical
parallels. Yet few Republicans have had the courage publicly to challenge Mr
Clinton. Afraid of appearing hard-hearted or apologists for the rich, most
redirected their fire to proposals that made sense, such as the planned
broad tax on energy.
Since the mid-19th century, forcible redistribution has typically been
justified by likening national income to a giant cake. Since we all have
similar material needs, the cake ought to be divided equally. Alas, this is
not practicable, but government can reduce inequality by imposing
progressive taxes - taxes that rise more than proportionately with income.
Utilitarians made this sound scientific by arguing that the law of
diminishing returns must apply to money. The greater a person's earnings the
less valuable must be each additional dollar of income: Dollars 100 means
little to a millionaire but a great deal to a beggar. The way to promote the
greatest happiness of the greatest number was thus to redistribute cash from
rich to poor until all incomes were equalised. Such logic eventually led to
top marginal rates of income tax in excess of 90 per cent in most
industrialised countries.
But, of course, the cake model is grossly misleading. The level of national
output is not a given, but depends crucially on economic incentives which
are blunted if incomes are equalised. This point may not seem compelling to
salaried employees of large, stable organisations. In the short run changes
in tax rates may not affect their hours of work or effort. But anybody
engaged in risky or entrepreneurial work does care about marginal tax rates.
A freelance journalist's incentive to write extra articles will be greater
if the top tax rate is 30 per cent rather than 40 per cent or 60 per cent.
And the trend towards corporate 'downsizing' suggests that many people
formerly in stable employment will face a less secure future.
More important, the cake analogy wrongly implies that society is a giant
organisation run by government. In reality, it consists of a myriad of
different individuals with different aptitudes pursuing different interests.
Government is needed not to manage everything but to underwrite essential
institutions, such as the legal system.
Material rewards depend on an unpredictable amalgam of effort, luck and
tastes. Luck covers inherited wealth, innate abilities and sheer good
fortune, for example selecting a profession that rises in esteem. Tastes
reflect preferences for financial as opposed to non-financial rewards: many
economics professors, for example, could triple their salaries by working on
Wall Street, but prefer a less hectic and more thoughtful lifestyle.
If government is not regarded as an all-powerful mother wielding a cake
knife, the logical fiscal system is one that leaves economic relationships
unchanged: in other words taxes that are proportional to income, rather than
progressive. This meets the practical requirement that taxes should be
related to ability to pay, but denies the majority a right to impose higher
tax rates on a minority (the wealthy) than they pay themselves. It regards
taxes as a tool for financing essential public services, including a
generous safety net for the poorest, but not as a means for social
engineering.
Such a rule meets common sense ethical standards. A rich man eating caviar
while children starve is an obscene spectacle. But what if the children are
eating hamburgers and chips? Is that kind of inequality fundamentally wrong?
There are also more mundane reasons for regarding specially high taxes on
the wealthy with scepticism. They are rarely paid. Mr Clinton is raising the
top rate by a third to 40 per cent. This translates into large notional tax
increases for the rich. A couple earning Dollars 500,000 a year faces an
annual increase of about Dollars 27,000; a couple earning Dollars 1m an
increase of about Dollars 80,000. Will such families hand over these sums or
will they call their tax lawyers and find legal ways to reduce their
liabilities?
History points to increased avoidance. The share of federal tax paid by the
top  1/2 per cent of taxpayers (those currently on more than Dollars
220,000) has typically oscillated between 15 per cent and 20 per cent,
regardless of the level of the top rate. Mr Robert Barro of Harvard
University points out that this share reached a postwar record high of 22
per cent in 1988, after the top rate fell to 28 per cent, higher than in
1960 when the top rate was 91 per cent.
In other words at the peak of the 'greedy' 1980s the rich were shouldering a
larger share of the national tax burden than ever before. This partly
reflected special factors, such as soaring asset prices, but the low tax
rates also increased incentives for top earners and reduced the advantage of
taking income in non-taxable forms, such as fringe benefits.
The Clinton administration will say that a 40 per cent top rate is not high
by historical standards. True, but the direction of change is ominous. So is
the hypocrisy of many liberal (left-leaning) Democrats who enjoy quite
lavish personal lifestyles while preaching a gospel of hairshirt
egalitarianism. Contrary to popular rhetoric, there are non-selfish,
principled reasons for questioning the merits of a tax increase restricted
to 1 per cent of the population.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARGARET QUASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is gratifying to learn from the report of the foreign affairs select
committee ('MPs in call to rejoin Unesco', August 4) that nothing stands in
the way of Britain rejoining the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation but 'spending pressures'.
The current assessment for UK membership is Pounds 10.6m a year, which will
be reduced to Pounds 8m when the US rejoins. Modest as this is for what we
get back (employment, sales of equipment, benefits of scientific research,
etc), it has, since 1964, come out of our overseas aid budget, which
Baroness Chalker is naturally reluctant to cut. But Unesco is not primarily
an aid agency; its field of activity encompasses science, education,
environment, culture and communications.
If the office of public service and science and the education, environment
and national heritage departments were to share the load with the Overseas
Development Administration, each would be required to pay only Pounds 2.13m
a year and would be getting an excellent bargain. And Britain would once
again be in a position to influence international policy on matters of great
concern. Margaret Quass,

FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Attack on Russian reformers' monetary
policy is misleading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof JEFFREY D SACHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Steve Hanke and Kurt Schuler (Personal View: 'How to halt Russia's
rouble charade', August 12) misdirect their fire by accusing Russia's
reformers of lacking a strategy to stabilise the rouble.
The reformers, led by finance minister Boric Federov, agree with Hanke and
Schuler that credit policy should be rule-based and restrictive. They face
profound political and institutional obstacles in implementing such a
policy.
Sometimes the conservatives still hold sway, as with last month's ridiculous
currency confiscation. None the less, the reformers have made progress:
hyperinflation has been avoided, credit creation has slowed, and the rouble
has strengthened in recent weeks.
Hanke and Schuler dismiss the reformers' efforts since they fall short of
the pristine standard of a currency board, with zero domestic credit
creation. Currency boards certainly have their merit, and have proved useful
for some small open economies such as Hong Kong and Estonia, though they
have been consistently eschewed by large countries for political and
economic reasons.
A currency board is neither necessary nor sufficient for stabilisation.
Hanke's favourite successes are Chile and China, neither of which has a
currency board. The vast majority of stabilisations throughout history have
been achieved without currency boards, while some countries with currency
boards or similar arrangements (such as Liberia and Panama) have none the
less succumbed to state bankruptcy.
Hanke and Schuler's call for rule-based monetary policy is most welcome, but
their attack on Russia's reformers for the failure to implement a particular
vision of 100 per cent monetary purity is thoroughly misleading.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Gamble to squeeze out corruption: South Korea's president is
taking a risk at a time when the economy is sluggish
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY JOHN BURTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kim Young-sam has sprung the biggest surprise of his six-month
presidency. Announcing last Thursday night an immediate ban on the use of
aliases in financial transactions, he boldly stepped up his campaign against
pervasive corruption in South Korean public life.
The requirement that owners of financial accounts disclose their identity is
intended to end the bribery which has enriched those at the top, and to
weaken the system of bureaucratic patronage which, the president believes,
is hampering Korea's international competitiveness.
Mr Kim said the move would eliminate 'the dark link between politics and
business', depriving officials of the ability to hide ill-gotten money. It
was also intended to stamp out tax evasion and the underground economy,
which is estimated to equal 20 per cent of gross national product.
Mr Kim is taking a big gamble at a time when the economy is sluggish; he
acknowledged that 'in the short term, the (real-name) system is likely to
cause a variety of ill effects'. Liquidation of accounts held in false names
sent share prices down 8 per cent by Saturday's stock market close.
There were worries that a capital shortage could cause problems for small
and med-ium-sized businesses which have depended on unofficial lending
markets largely financed by money held under false names. The move could
also precipitate flight of capital abroad or into property as investors seek
new tax havens, though the government promised to prevent this.
Mr Kim's broader aim is to reduce centralised management of the economy by
bureaucrats and politicians, and to give greater play to market forces in
order to restore the country's industrial competitiveness, which has lagged
in recent years as wage costs have risen and productivity has dropped.
The president had bitterly attacked the status quo during 20 years of
opposition to the military dictatorship which collapsed in 1987. When he
abandoned the opposition in 1990 and became the conservative government's
presidential candidate in last December's election, suspicions grew that he
was really a politician of the old school. But his record in office has
restored his reformist credentials.
First, he ousted the authoritarian old guard at the top of the military
establishment and the intelligence agency, and imposed civilian control over
these powerful organisations in an effort to complete Korea's transition to
democracy.
Then came an aggressive anti-corruption campaign, which exposed bribery
among senior government officials, military officers, university
administrators, bank presidents and corporate executives. Top politicians
and government officials have been forced to disclose their assets. The
government audit agency and the tax authorities have been ordered to uncover
corruption in government and business. The campaign has won Mr Kim immense
popularity, with approval ratings of 80 per cent or more.
But he is not without critics. The reform programme has been blamed for
disrupting the economy, which grew by 3.9 per cent during the first half of
1993 compared with the same period in 1992, slow by comparison with other
Asian countries such as China. The central bank forecasts that the growth
rate for the full year will be 5.7 per cent, below the government target of
6 per cent.
The Federation of Korean Industries, the leading business lobby group, has
complained that uncertainties created by reform proposals on streamlining
the country's big business empires, labour policy and financial
liberalisation have dampened corporate investment.
Officials who process corporate proposals for new investment have delayed
decisions because they fear being accused of corrupt practice.
'It is easy to forget that the system of pay-offs did allow businessmen to
get things done under a regime of strict bureaucratic controls,' says the
head of research at a western broking company in Seoul. 'Remove the only way
around the regulations, without changing the actual rules, and you have
accomplished nothing except to make it harder than before to function,' he
added.
However, Mr Sanjoy Chowdhury, chief Asia/Pacific economist for Merrill
Lynch, the US broking house, says: 'President Kim needs to show
determination in correcting the structural faults that threatened Korea's
future prosperity. His programme offers progress in that direction, although
more may need to done.'
The challenge facing Mr Kim is to reduce government control over the economy
because the current system, once praised as a model for developing
countries, is criticised as outdated for Korea's mature economy. The
government no longer appears able to guide industrial development
efficiently. Instead, the bureaucracy's taste for micro-management hinders
restructuring of industry.
Taming the bureaucracy would improve prospects for implementing economic
reform in three main areas:
Financial liberalisation: easing state controls on banks and capital markets
and reducing the government's role in credit allocation, in order to make
more efficient use of capital and stop pouring money into uncompetitive
companies that the government deems strategic.
Industrial policy: the government wants to reduce the dominance of the large
conglomerates, the chaebol, and to promote small and medium-sized companies.
The aim is that the chaebol should concentrate on a few core industries.
Fiscal policy: promoting economic equality by broadening the tax base,
cracking down on tax cheating and closing loopholes.
Mr Ahn Chung-ni, a professor of political science at Seoul National
University, says: 'Kim is engaged in a race against time in achieving his
political and economic reforms. He has to push as fast as possible and keep
his conservative opponents off-balance.'
Politically, Mr Kim appears safe for now. He has used the anti-corruption
campaign to strengthen his position within the ruling Democratic Liberal
party. Internal opponents, mostly linked with previous military-backed
governments, have been forced to disclose fortunes gained through
questionable means. The reform programme has deprived the main opposition
Democratic party of a strong alternative message to attract voters.
The biggest threat to Mr Kim is a faltering economy, which could cause his
popularity to fall.
There are some healthy signs: wage growth has slowed as lower inflation and
worries about job security have persuaded workers to accept moderate pay
increases; and exports have risen because of the depreciation of the Korean
won against the Japanese yen. Most economists predict that growth will
accelerate in the second half of the year.
But the slowdown in the Chinese economy - a growing market for Korean
products - could undermine exports, and a rise in interest rates as a result
of the introduction of the real-name system could depress investment.
There are indications that Mr Kim is prepared to tone down reforms to keep
the economy going. Investigations of corruption in the banking, construction
and defence industries appear to have been curtailed in an attempt to
restore business confidence.
However, Mr Kim has indicated his determination to press ahead. The next few
months will test his skill in balancing long-term goals against the need to
revive economic growth quickly. South Korea's future depends on his success.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: A unitary coal business would offer
the industry more security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J D MEADS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The theme of Tony Jackson's article ('No more buried treasure', August
9) was that UK coal reserves, and the collieries which work them, have a
value only to the extent that coal production is - or can be - profitable. I
do not dispute that general principle.
Where Mr Jackson's analysis was deficient - apart from his underestimation
of the technical difficulties and costs of mothballing collieries - is his
lack of appreciation of how the UK coal industry's efficiency has advanced
in recent times.
Since the national strike of the mid-1980s British Coal collieries have
achieved real unit cost reductions averaging 5 per cent each year. We can
and will maintain this rate of progress. The figure of Pounds 2.3bn which Mr
Jackson quotes as the 'subsidy' inherent in British Coal's prices to the
electricity generators is open to serious dispute; the figure is, in any
event, out of date, because it was calculated on the basis of British Coal's
1990-93 contracts with the generators now expired - not the current ones.
At privatisation, the new owner of British Coal is likely to find that it
has more collieries capable of matching the price of imported coal,
delivered to the UK customer, than it can find a market for. The crux of the
problem is that the size of the UK coal market will be constrained by
possible sales volume imposed largely by the excessive building of new
gas-fired power stations - rather than by the relative cost of UK and
imported coal.
Whether the UK coal industry will have a viable future beyond expiry of the
present coal contracts in 1998 will be determined by the extent to which it
is able to retain and reinvest the profitability which its efficiency ought
to justify.
The key issue here is privatisation structure; as Mr Jackson acknowledges,
the life of a fragmented UK coal industry is likely to be nasty, brutish and
short. While British Coal will be able to compete with imports within the
UK, it will not normally be able to compete in export markets. This will
place enormous bargaining strength in the hands of the electricity
generators when it comes to renegotiating the present coal contracts. A
unitary coal business would be best placed to counter that strength, as well
as being best able to spread the risks inherent in all mining operations,
particularly those undertaken in UK geological conditions.
It is true, as Mr Jackson points out, that in terms of employee numbers
British Coal is now but a shadow of its former self. But surely that does
not justify the insouciance with which he contemplates our complete demise?

FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Tales of two cities - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the summer feels more like the autumn, which it does in England this
August, there are only two things to do. One is to escape to the sun, the
other is to curl up with a good book. I suppose you could combine the two
activities, but I have never found it easy to read on a beach or to do
anything very much at all in the hot sun.
Two good new books this summer may give readers the opportunity to mug up a
bit on some appropriate regional architectural history before they travel or
even to get on with some continuing education of a fairly serious kind.
As far as I know, there is not yet a bluffers' guide to Tuscan towns or a
simple introduction to the Baroque of the Balearics. But there are other
ways of immersing the mind in architecture and often the less obvious books
are the best.
Visitors to the Edinburgh festival can this year enjoy the architecture of
the city with a new edition of Charles McKean's guide book. Edinburgh: An
Illustrated Architectural Guide (published by the Royal Incorporation of
Architects of Scotland, Pounds 9.95, 236 pages). This new edition of the
guide was sponsored by The City of Edinburgh District Council and Edinburgh
Enterprise Limited for the European Summit last December, but it is a
timeless guide that should be in the hands of every visitor to the Edinburgh
festival.
It is an advantage to have a pocket-size guidebook, but I wish for more from
Mr McKean particularly because his picture research is so good. The are
wonderful visions that were never built, like Robert Adam's 1791 proposal
for a new bridge to link Calton Hill to Prince's Street, and J. Dick
Peddie's view of a completed Parthenon high above the city.
The author is also good at making the visitor look about him and think of
the future of the city as well as what is before him. As McKean says,
Edinburgh is about to have a new Opera House, a conference centre, a new
headquarters for Scottish administration and the sizeable Maybury business
park.
Does the city have a policy for the residential rejuvenation of the Old Town
or for phoenix-like transformations to follow on that of Leith? What about
the future of the Trinity area, which McKean memorably describes as a home
for the 'unbuttoned mercantile princes of Leith and artists, maiden ladies
and mistresses?'
Edinburgh is much enlivened by this book, with its clear explanations of the
differences between the old and the new towns of Edinburgh and its simple
exposure of the incredible architectural wealth of a city that still keeps
many of its glories, both classical and gothic well hidden from its native
residents as well as festival guests. Mr McKean opens Edinburgh's
architectural doors.
*****
From the Athens of the North to Rome. I was fascinated by a book about that
intriguing Roman building the Villa Madama which, although unfinished,
remains a key point of reference in Italian Renaissance architecture. Villa
Madama: a memoir relating to Raphael's project by Guy Dewez (Lund Humphries
Pounds 35, 184 pages) is an unusual kind of architectural history.
The author uncovers the plans and proposals of Raphael for his patron,
Cardinal Giulio de Medici, who was the first cousin of and Secretary of
State to Pope Leo X.
Construction began on the villa in 1518, but Raphael died in 1520 and,
although work continued under the direction of Giulio Romano, it was never
completed. It was a project of great importance in the early Cinquecento,
ranking with the Michaelangelo commissions in Florence and marking the
importance of the Medici presence at the gates of papal states.
Today the villa is hard to see, as it is in the custody of the Italian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It lies to the north-east of Rome, high on its
hillside among woods and gardens. It is used in much the same way as the
Medici planned - a place for high-level foreign ministry meetings and state
receptions. Guy Dewez has clearly been obsessed, in the best sense, by this
incomplete masterpiece and his researches are accessibly published here in a
way that convincingly shows how the villa would have looked if it had been
finished by Raphael.
It was a perfect example of the Renaissance wish to idealise the antique
Roman villa - a place where the pleasures of civilisation could be enjoyed
and demonstrated in a rural setting. The discovery and publication in this
book of a letter from Raphael to his patron provides us with a first hand
account of the artist's intentions.
Raphael writes of the siting of the villa to 'face the most salutary winds'.
Part of the villa is to be a circular structure, 'lit through a ring of
glass windows, each of which is successively visited by the sun from the
time it rises to the time it sets - a delightful place in which to hold
polite conversation.'
Bathing was clearly an important part of villa life and Raphael thought it
important to be able to bathe in the sunlight: 'in front of the window a
place where one may lie in the water and be washed by one's servant without
coming under his shade . . .'
This delightful letter is supported in the book by many romantic 19th
century photographs that show the incomplete villa in an agreeable state of
arcadian decay. The author's own immaculate measured drawings provide a
lucid vision of how the villa might have looked if completed. This kind of
informed speculation about such an important place makes for the best kind
