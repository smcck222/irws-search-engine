FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Armida and Maometto II - Rossini Opera Festival at
Pesaro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programmes of the Rossini Opera Festival, though never crammed (like
Spoleto, for example), can be counted on to provide welcome variety, usually
with an element of surprise. The two operas featured in this year's festival
 -which opened this past week and continues until August 22 - represent a
relative rarity, Armida, followed by the revival of a successful Pesaro
production of some eight years ago, Maometto II, designed and staged by Pier
Luigi Pizzi.
These productions are complemented by other events: concerts, recitals,
lectures, exhibitions, and a two-week course for young artists, sponsored by
the Peter Moores Foundation.
But, inevitably, attention focuses on the two operas; and this year Armida
was awaited with special anticipation. Long neglected, the work was revived
in Florence in 1952 for Maria Callas, at the height of her powers, and those
unforgotten performances, in the opinion of many music historians, mark the
true beginning of the Rossini renaissance, which Pesaro has so intelligently
and successfully institutionalised.
Armida is one of Rossini's Naples operas, composed for the great soprano
(his future wife) Isabella Colbran; and while not merely a star-vehicle, the
work certainly requires the presence of a supreme interpreter in the title
role. The American singer Rene Fleming is an attractive and gifted artist,
but she does not possess star dimensions. In other contexts her lack of
vocal sensuality can even be a merit; but in Armida she remained always this
side of a full embodiment of the towering part, the only female character.
She was more than adequately supported, though her Rinaldo, the tenor
Gregory Kunde, was more bouncy than heroic, and his occasional high notes
blasted forth, true but unappealing. Of the six tenors in the cast, the most
enjoyable were perhaps Jorio Zennaro and Bruce Fowler, whose charming duet
opens the last act.
The orchestra and chorus from the Teatro Comunale, Bologna, were not in
their best form. The winds were especially aberrant; the chorus lacked
impact. Daniele Gatti conducted accurately and soberly, though without bite,
occasionally indulging the singers more than advisable.
But even Callas, even Colbran would have had a hard time overcoming the
handicap of the Luca Ronconi production (indeed, it is doubtful whether
either of those firm-minded women would have tolerated it).
Ronconi evidently decided that, despite its definition as a dramma, and
despite the fact that it was written for a great tragedienne, Armida is full
of laughs.
In the first act, the stage of the Teatro Rossini was turned into a Middle
Eastern desert complete with ruins and the male chorus in Beau Geste,
Foreign Legion costumes. There was a good deal of clowning, indicating that
the sorceress Armida's magic lay entirely in her sex-appeal. To underline
the pin-up characterisation, Miss Fleming was made to wear a dress worthy of
Adrian or Edith Head and a ridiculous blond ziggurat of hair that even Mae
West would have thought vulgar.
The last two acts of the opera, in which Armida gives free rein to her
sorcery (and Rossini to his), comprise some of the composer's most sensitive
and imaginative pages. With Ronconi's tacky staging - Tasso's garden of
delights was a black backdrop with the seductive houris turned into cheap
whores from a Berlin brothel of the 1920s - you had to make a huge effort of
will to hear the musical treasures against the anti-musical production.
Even when one likes a Ronconi production, one always has the lurking
suspicion that the producer hates music. Even when one has reservations
about a Pizzi production, there is never any question about his genuine,
insightful feeling for opera. And his Maometto II inspires no reservations:
it is elegantly conceived, tellingly executed, of unerring taste. Originally
designed for the Teatro Rossini, it has been moved to the Palafestival (the
barn-like reconverted basketball stadium) with a slight loss of intimacy but
a gain in grandeur.
The work was first performed in 1820 (just three years after Armida and,
like it, at the San Carlo in Naples), again with the great Colbran. Cecilia
Gasdia has gradually gained remarkable power and authority, and now as Anna
 -the protagonist - she is touchingly vulnerable and, at the same time,
defiantly heroic, loving and brave. In the long second act, she is almost
always on stage; and in the final hour of the opera, she sings a succession
of astonishing numbers, including a great extended trio and a complex
finale.
Her performance is a triumph, at every moment supported by Pizzi's sensitive
direction, and by the excellent performances of the other singers, notably
the mezzo-soprano Gloria Scalchi (a tasteful, understated Calbo),the young
Mexican tenor Ramon Vargas, whose voice is clean, clear, pleasing, and the
bass Michele Pertusi, the Maometto, a young artist who made a deep
impression in Semiramide during last year's festival.
The Radio-Sinfonieorchester of Stuttgart, conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti
with accurate attention but with little flair, is an improvement over the
Bologna of the previous night, and the Prague Chamber Chorus trained by
Lubomir Matl is first-rate.
Pertusi, Scalchi - and now Vargas - are to some extent Pesaro discoveries, a
sign that the festival is now developing its own stable of stylistically
appropriate Rossini singers. The not always idiomatic superstars of the
early days have pretty much vanished from the programme; Pesaro's next job
surely is to develop some new conductors and - vain hope, no doubt - a few
more sensitive producers.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Behind the Fringe - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD

<TEXT>
Even in Edinburgh, they cannot control the weather, or perhaps they can.
Saturday's steady drizzle gave way to low cloud and a nip in the air
yesterday morning. Then suddenly the sun came out for the official opening
of the 1993 Festival.
Actually the festival with a small 'f' had already started. Fringe
productions have been running since early this month. In a relatively new
development, there have already been previews in London. It is used to be
Edinburgh first, then London.
The fringe gets bigger and bigger. Now in its 47th year, it will host a
record 1,235 productions with an estimated total of over 12,000 performances
at 165 different venues. In 1978 the number of shows was only 472.
It is also becoming more professional. The days when any college dramatic
society could slum it for a few weeks in Edinburgh seem to be over. When the
Red Shift Company is premiering the first stage version of Thomas Mann's
Death In Venice, you are up against serious competition.
There are as yet no identifiable themes, just oddities. For example, there
are four separate productions of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing - a
play which is currently going down well in London's Shaftesbury Avenue - and
three of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The oddest show of the lot may turn out
be music from a New Zealand Celtic band.
Ticket prices are up, but not substantially. Entrance to over half of this
year's fringe shows will be Pounds 5 or less, and a few are free. At the
official Festival, sponsorship is at a record level of Pounds 805,000. Among
the leading contributors are the privatised British Gas Scotland and
Scottish Power. The latter is the biggest private sponsor of the lot and is
backing some of the notable musical events, such as the Verdi Requiem
performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.
The official Festival has reacted to suggestions that the main European
theatre festival of the year is now in Salzburg by introducing a programme
of collaboration. Peter Stein's production of Julius Caesar, which was shown
in Salzburg last year, will reappear at the Royal Highland Exhibition Hall.
Peter Sellars' production of The Persians by Aeschylus, which opens today,
has also been seen at Salzburg.
So far, however, the main attraction is neither theatre nor music. It is an
outstanding exhibition of photographs called The Waking Dream: Photography's
First Century, and comes from the Gilman Paper Company Collection in New
York. When a very similar exhibition was shown recently at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, I am told that the lighting was a little brighter. Edinburgh
might take note of that.
Otherwise, this is the exhibition to see. Note, for instance, the wonderful
pictures of Lady Ottoline Morrell in Cavorting by the Pool at Garsington,
circa 1916 and the pictures of the American Civil War. The exhibition runs
at the City Art Centre until October 2.

<TEXT>
Picking out the genuinely new programmes is becoming harder and harder. The
BBC is now going to extraordinary lengths to disguise repeats. BBC1's
Driving Obsessions about young aggressive men in cars was 'first shown on
BBC South East'. Food And Drink's Choice Cuts on the same channel offers
'highlights' from past series. Czech Mates? about the development of
manufacturing after the fall of communism falls back on 'Another chance to
see'. None of these programmes is actually billed as a repeat.
The two most enticing new programmes both go out at 9 o'clock, of course. In
Frank Stubbs Promotes (ITV) Timothy Spall's former ticket tout, full of
bluster and pathos, takes up with a soccer star. In Travellers' Tales (C4)
Romanian writer Andrei Codrescu sets out to drive across his adopted
homeland, the US.
The Monday Play on Radio 4 is 'A Woman Of Judah' by Ronald Frame. In a small
town in Dorset in the 1930s a young lawyer finds himself defending the
doctor's wife against a charge of scandalous behaviour (7.45).

FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Tonight - Lola Blau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Georg Kreisler (b. 1922), the Viennese song-writer, performer and
playwright, was one of the lucky ones. He managed to leave Austria (with his
family) in 1938, worked in Hollywood and New York, and only returned to
Vienna in 1955. Though he had grown so accustomed to writing in English that
he found it hard to resume his native tongue, it was back home in Vienna,
that he began to enjoy the greatest success of his career; and, according to
the Old Red Lion's programme note, he's still at it.
The heroine of his show, Tonight: Lola Blau, is a chanteuse, but otherwise
her career is his. She is a Jew who manages to escape from Europe with her
career intact, enjoys success in America, and then returns to Vienna.
Kreisler, in telling her story, tries to highlight a few aspects of the
society around her - the importance of her entertainment to the poor as well
as the rich, and the anti-Semitism that survives in postwar Austria.
It is, however, alarming to find how lightweight, how passive, Lola Blau's
story is. She just happens to escape from Austria, she just happens to
become a star, she just happens to go back home. The only thing of which she
expresses real need is to make it as a performer; and then to keep on making
it. Sure, she passes social comment now and then; but she spends more time
commenting on the vicissitudes of a stage career than on life outside the
theatre. Refuge, life and limb register less strongly with her than stardom.
And Kreisler conceives her role more as a tour de force, song upon song upon
song upon song, than as a character.
This British premiere has the benefit of an uncannily first-rate translation
by Don White, with all the songs in stylish rhymes, witty words and virtuoso
metres (can the German original have been this good?), a highly accomplished
performance of the central role by Esther Zchieschow (an actress from what
was 'East Germany' performing in English for the first time with exceptional
assurance), and fluent direction by Phil Young.
But Zchieschow does no more to round out Lola than Kreisler. She rattles off
this huge, wordy, song-and-dance role with impressive concentration; but her
Lola is not a star (just very accomplished), not a personality (just a
commentator). There is more authority in Darryl Goodwin's performance of
three small roles; and he also plays in the excellent stage band. It is easy
to enjoy each passing feature of this show - but its heart is hollow.
At the Old Red Lion, London EC1 (071) 837 7816 until
September 4; at the Old Fire Station, Oxford (0865) 79494, September 13-27

FT  16 AUG 93 / People: Change of direction at EIU
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nico Colchester, deputy editor of The Economist who failed to secure the top
job earlier in the year, is moving to the Economist Intelligence Unit at the
end of this month as editorial director.
At the same time, Helen Alexander, previously international circulation
director of the Economist, becomes managing director of the EIU.
'I had long thought that it was rather an attractive job - not that I didn't
already have a pretty attractive job,' says Colchester. Ironically, Bill
Emmott, who beat Colchester to the editor's seat in what the latter refers
to as 'that fateful selection process', had recently been on secondment for
six months at EIU doing that very job.
When it became clear he was not to become the next editor of the newspaper,
46-year-old Colchester, who was foreign editor of the Financial Times before
moving to The Economist in 1986, says he looked around at other options, but
admits that now is not 'a frightfully good time in the economic cycle'. He
also put his name forward for the EIU.
Now he is pleased to be running his own show - one with a turnover of Pounds
29m, compared with Pounds 67m at The Economist. He also thinks that 'there
is a lot of scope for enhancing the public image of the EIU. It has rather
hidden its light under a bushel, not having had much of a front man.'
Alexander, who is understood to have turned down a highly lucrative outside
offer to accept the EIU position, joined The Economist in 1985. She has
recently been responsible for marketing and circulation in all regions
outside North America.

<TEXT>
Anglia Polytechnic University is to receive funding from the European
Community under the THERMIE project, a five-year European Community
programme to promote the design and use of new energy saving technology.
The successful bid is in respect of innovatory energy efficient elements
incorporated into the design of Anglia's Learning Resource Centre, the first
phase of the new university campus in Chelmsford. The Pounds 4.9m centre,
which is to be built by WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION, is due for completion in summer
1994.
The building will incorporate design concepts to reduce energy costs by up
to 50 per cent and will obviate the need for an air conditioning system by
use of stack ventilation towers to improve through ventilation.
Good daylighting is another key element and will be enhanced by windows with
light shelves to reflect light deeper into the building.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAING NORTH WEST has been appointed to build Manchester's international
concert hall, the new home for the Halle. Work is due to start on site today
with completion scheduled for February 1996.
The total cost of the project will be around Pounds 42m. The company's bid
for the main building contract was accepted by the partners in the venture,
Manchester City Council and Central Manchester Development Corporation, who
are jointly funding the project with the aid of a 40 per cent grant from the
European Regional Development Fund.
Laing North West won the contract in competition with four other large
construction companies, shortlisted from 30 leading companies who expressed
an interest in the project.
Preparation work has been completed by P Casey (Civil Engineering), which
has removed 26,000 tonnes of soil to make way for the concert hall. It has
also put in the foundations for the building, including more than 150
reinforced concrete columns.
One of Laing's first jobs on site will be to install vibration isolation
bearings on to the columns - creating a foundation of springs - to isolate
the hall from passing traffic, including Metrolink trams.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NatWest Markets has brought Tomasz Herbich, previously managing director for
global trading technology at Bankers Trust, into a new role as director of
information technology.
The corporate and investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank has
been formed out of many constituent parts, including County NatWest and
NatWest's treasury department, hence also throwing together many different
types of system.
There were also three separate technology heads - variously looking after
the front office, back office, and data and telecommunications. Now those
three heads report to Herbich, whose task it is to co-ordinate and develop
the group's IT capabilities both in London and abroad.
'I was very agreeably surprised as to how much importance NatWest's senior
management attaches to technology,' says Herbich, who adds that the areas
particularly targeted for systems development are equities, capital markets
and treasury.
Herbich, of Polish extraction but reared in Scotland, has degrees in
operational research and management science.
He has spent the past 16 years at Bankers Trust, partly in London, partly in
New York. Bankers Trust's front office trading system REMOS, which has been
sold on to a number of other banks, was Herbich's brainchild, first
developed for foreign exchange in 1983.
He had been at the US investment bank's headquarters since 1991, but wanted
to return to the UK, since he was regularly commuting across the Atlantic to
see his wife who had stayed in London.

The World Bank has appointed LG MOUCHEL &amp; PARTNERS as chief adviser to the
Chinese Ministry of Domestic Trade in a large investment programme to
improve the efficiency of China's domestic and international grain
management.
A network of modern storage installations will be constructed including
local primary depots servicing a number of farms, intermediate depots at
strategic railheads and installations of up to 300,000 tonnes capacity at a
number of deepwater ports.
The storage installations will be equipped with appropriate aeration and
drying facilities to conserve the grain and bulk handling methods for grain
will be introduced to replace the traditional bagged handling methods.
At the port locations, modern high capacity bulk ship loading and unloading
equipment and deepwater berths will allow the transport of grain by large
bulk grain carriers which can transport their cargo to large population
centres in China or to overseas markets.

FT  16 AUG 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's two biggest insurance brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon are
expected to post pre-tax profits roughly the same level as last year when
they report interim results.
Sedgwick, reporting tomorrow is expected to register pre-tax profits of
between Pounds 48m to Pounds 58m (compared with Pounds 51.7m last year),
while Willis, which reports on Thursday, is expected to make between Pounds
58m and Pounds 63m (Pounds 56.7m).
Both brokers are universally expected to maintain dividend rates, 3p for
Sedgwick and a second quarterly dividend of 1.65p for Willis. Difficulties
in the US market, which remains competitive, are one of the main factors
holding back further improvement.
Meanwhile Argos, the catalogue retailer, is expected to benefit from the
elimination of losses from the ill-fated Chesterman furniture business when
it reports its interim results today.
Pre-tax profits of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 14m are expected against
Pounds 9.5m last time. However the main focus of attention will be on
current trading to see whether the post-Christmas pick-up is continuing.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is tomorrow expected to announce pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 240m to Pounds 280m for the third quarter. This
compares with Pounds 274m in the comparative year-ago period.
The group has been adversely affected by the strike at Peabody Coal in the
US, which has cost it around Pounds 30m. However, the stronger dollar is
expected to benefit it by a similar amount since more than half its profits
are generated in North America.
BICC, the cables and construction group, is expected to report a fall in
half year profits, from Pounds 58m to around Pounds 53m, on Wednesday. The
company has suffered from the longevity of the UK recession, which has
affected most of its markets.
On Thursday Wickes, the do-it-yourself group, is expected to show a 35 per
cent improvement to about Pounds 3.5m when it reports interim results. The
growth is likely to be the result of lower losses in its Hunter timber
business, and some advance in the UK DIY retail chain.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Economics: Indicators prompt market focuson inflation in UK
and Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOW of UK official statistics continues this week with the latest
figures for retail sales, retail price inflation and the public sector
borrowing requirement.
Economists are expecting a fall in July retail sales as a correction to the
inflated June figure, which was pushed up by early summer sales.
Price discounts in the high streets were also one of the factors pushing the
June inflation rate down to 1.2 per cent. City economists are forecasting
that it notched back up to 1.5 per cent in July, partly as a bounce back
from June, but also because of certain other factors such as the ending of
British Telecommunications' special offer on cheap rate local calls.
None the less, prices for seasonal food usually fall sharply in July and
continuing summer sales will help keep prices low for clothing, footwear and
household goods.
Most economists are confident that underlying inflation - the RPI excluding
mortgage interest payments - will remain within the government's target
range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent for the rest of this year,
although they expect it to have crept upwards in July.
This week also sees the release of west Germany's July producer prices which
are expected to have stayed broadly flat, with inflationary pressures at the
producer level very weak. However, M3 - also due this week - will show that
the story at a consumer level is quite the opposite with prices still
stubbornly high. June's annualised growth was 7 per cent. It is expected to
have risen to 8 per cent in July.
Today: French and Belgian markets closed for holiday. Finland, July CPI (up
2.2 per cent on year). US, July industrial production (up 0.4 per cent),
capacity utilisation (81.4 per cent). Japan, June industrial production,

per cent on year), excluding mortgage interest payments (up 3 per cent on
year); July retail sales (down 0.3 per cent on month, up 4.6 per cent on
year). Sweden, July trade balance (SKr5.6bn). Canada, June manufacturing new
orders (up 0.8 per cent on month), manufacturing shipments (up 0.4 per cent

FT  16 AUG 93 / Management: Home is where the office is - Employers are
adopting a far more flexible approach to traditional working practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Donna Cunningham, media relations manager for Bell Labs, goes to work
in the morning, she simply walks from the kitchen of her house, deep in the
woods of Vermont, to a small room she uses as her office.
Headquarters is a six-hour drive away in New Jersey, but Cunningham says she
keeps in touch easily through a host of technologies from electronic mail to
video conferen-cing.
'I get a tremendous amount of work done,' says Cunningham. 'The biggest
distraction I might have here is if a deer happens to pass by my window.'
Cunningham is part of a growing trend in the US which is not only allowing,
but actively encouraging, employees to work outside the office. A distance
of six hours is still more than most employers are willing to put up with,
but the traditional notion of an office as a place workers must report to
every day is giving way to a far more flexible approach.
Home offices are just part of the new trend. Companies are making heavy use
of telecommuting, a policy which allows employees to go to the office one or
two days a week and spend the rest of the time with clients or working at
home. Several groups have also pioneered the concept of 'hoteling', a
systemised policy of office-sharing for workers who spend a small portion of
their time at the office.
Companies have been experimenting with the concept of working from home and
telecommuting for more than a decade. However, over the past few years
several groups have formalised the approach, incorporating large numbers of
employees into the plan.
'We've been practising telecommuting informally for years, but now, we've
adopted it as a formal policy,' says Susan Sears, district manager of AT&amp;T
in Phoenix, Arizona.
One management consultant firm, Buck Consultants, estimates that between 10
and 20 per cent of the US workforce will spend a significant amount of time
working at home by the end of the century.
The concept, companies say, is working well. According to an AT&amp;T survey, 83
per cent of the 45 employees involved in a pilot telecommuting programme in
Phoenix for the past few years said they had increased their productivity,
and 80 per cent of their supervisors agreed. International Business Machines
also noted an increase in productivity following the implementation of
telecommuting programmes a few years ago. Today, more than one third of the
IBM workforce does some portion of their work at home.
A number of large US companies, including IBM, AT&amp;T, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur
Andersen and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, say they are adopting the telecommuting
concept as a key management strategy.
'We certainly plan to expand the programme,' says Michael Bell, director of
corporate real estate at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. 'It's been a tremendous success.'
Employers say workers under telecommuting and work-at-home programmes are
more efficient because they have fewer distractions and waste far less time
commuting.
Russell Thomas, a specialist on telecommuting with AT&amp;T says: 'Before we
adopted telecommuting we had situations that people would drive one and a
half hours to the office, stay for a few hours, drive an hour to visit a
client, come back to the office, then leave for the day. Obviously, there
was a big loss in productivity going on.' In response, AT&amp;T launched the
concept of the 'virtual office', a mobile office, complete with laptop
computer and fax, which the employee could use in a hotel, branch office, or
at home.
A number of factors are adding to the telecommuting impetus. One of the most
important is the Clean Air Act, which by 1996 will force many companies in
the US to cut the number of miles driven by single-car commuters by 25 per
cent. The aim of the new law is to reduce vehicle pollution in the
smog-ridden metropolitan areas.
Kenneth Maikiewicz, a transportation consultant with Raymond Keyes
Consultants, says: 'Companies will use telecommuting as one important way of
reducing vehicle trips.'
Improvements in technology are also fuelling the trend. 'Technology is the
key to making all this work,' says Michael Thompson, operations and
facilities director at Ernst &amp; Young. 'We give people faxes, notebook
computers, everything they need to work outside the office.'
With technologies such as cellular telephones and electronic mail moving
into widespread use, companies predict telecommuting will become easier.
Improved computer data access will also play an important role. 'We are
giving employees the capability of accessing all company files from a home
computer,' says Thompson. 'It will make telecommuting even more efficient.'
Increasing cost-consciousness has also encouraged companies to consider
telecommuting as a formal strategy. 'When the economy was booming,' says
Thompson, 'companies didn't care as much about real estate costs. But that's
become a real issue now.'
Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software cut real estate expenses by 30 per cent through
the use of telecommuting, even after buying high-technology home equipment
for workers, according to Jennifer Oden, director of real estate and
services at the group.
Ernst &amp; Young, in its Chicago office, has adopted a strategy of employee
expansion with no added space. A year ago, the firm pioneered the concept of
'hoteling', a sophisticated office-sharing plan, to help it meet its
cost-cutting goals. Under 'hoteling', employees who spend a lot of time with
clients - including auditors and management consultants - are not assigned a
permanent desk. They are expected to spend most of their time outside the
office, and when they plan a visit, they must call to reserve a place.
On the day an employee is expected in the office, all calls are
automatically forwarded to that extension, and the information appears on a
computerised 'staff locator system' to help colleagues find co-workers. A
small staff of 'hoteling managers' makes sure the employee's nameplate is
placed on the door and will even put family photos on the desk to make the
employee feel at home.
Of course, telecommuting does pose some disadvantages to both worker and
supervisors. Ernst &amp; Young complains of workers with a strong territorial
instinct, who try to take exclusive hold of a temporary office.
Employees sometimes worry about their chances of promotion if they are out
of the office for long periods of time. 'It would be extremely difficult for
me to move up in the company,' says Cunningham of Bell Labs. 'But I accepted
that when I agreed to work at home.'
Other workers may have unrealistic ideas about the benefits of
telecommuting. 'You have to screen workers carefully before you put them
into a programme like this,' says Charles Rodgers, president of Rodgers &amp;
Associates, a management consultancy special-ising in telecommuting issues.
'Some mistakenly believe that this will be a solution to their child-care
problems. Others might miss the stimulation of conversing with co-workers
and still others may not have the self-motivation to make this work.'
The biggest obstacle to a successful telecommuting programme, though, may be
the resistance of management. 'A lot of supervisors are uncomfortable with
this arrangement,' says Rodgers. 'Many mangers have the idea that visibility
equals productivity. They feel if they can't see the work being done, it
isn't getting done.'
Despite some resistance on the part of employees and supervisors, companies
say the concept works well. 'It improves productivity, helps us address
environmental issues and cuts down on real estate costs,' says Ann Riley,
project leader for work life programmes at IBM.
'It is an extremely successful programme which we will certainly take as far
as we can.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Management: Taking stock of windfalls - Executive share
options face closer scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days when directors of badly performing companies could enjoy windfall
gains from exercising their executive share options are over. Last month's
joint announcement from Britain's largest investor bodies has put a stop to
that: from now on any scheme that does not relate the exercise of share
options to the company's performance may find itself slung out by
shareholders.
The long-awaited recommendation from the Association of British Insurers and
the National Association of Pension Funds has left companies alternately
gnashing their teeth and scratching their heads. Most objected vigorously to
any idea that their schemes should be tied to performance and many wrote to
the NAPF last year to complain when it asked them for their opinions. They
must now accept that their battle is lost.
At the same time as protesting against any performance link, companies
pleaded for flexibility. In this their pleas have been answered. The
guidelines do not refer to any particular measure of performance, but simply
state there should be 'significant and sustained improvement in underlying
financial performance'. However the vagueness of this recommendation has
left them in the dark. What sort of performance link will be acceptable?
The question is of pressing interest to companies as most of their 10-year
schemes come up for renewal next year. For the new schemes to win
shareholders' approval, they must not only be linked to performance, but
must have been drawn up by the company's independent remuneration committee
and the guidelines must be published in the annual report.
According to Mark Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants, executive pay
experts, companies are feeling in need of guidance on how stringent the
performance targets should be. But the investor bodies - which have taken
almost a year to agree on the recommendation - seem in no mood to lay down
more precise guidelines.
'Our message is that whatever your remuneration committee recommends is the
most appropriate measure. If the committee can't come up with a reasonable
measure there are 101 consultants out there who would be only too happy to
find them one,' says John Rogers from the NAPF.
So which measures will companies choose? Perhaps the simplest is that
initially proposed by the NAPF: relative share-price performance. It
suggested that directors should be allowed to exercise share options only if
their shares out-performed the market index, or a sub-index over a given
period.
The main alternative is to use profit-related measures, originally preferred
by the ABI. Both yardsticks have weaknesses, share prices can be inflated by
bid pressure and reflect future as well as past performance. Profit measures
on the other hand have been complicated by new accounting rules which make
earnings more volatile.
Once the measure has been selected how stringent should the target be? Is
any out-performance of the share price enough? Should earnings be in the top
quartile of the industry group, or is it enough merely for them to rise
faster than inflation.
These are issues that each remuneration committee will have to decide and it
will be a delicate balancing act. 'You don't want something so difficult
that the options will never kick in, but you don't want something so easy
that it is a joke,' says Hugh Jones from the Prudential. He argues that to
strike the balance should not be too difficult: after all there is an
element of judgment in all business decisions and this one is no exception.
Shareholders hope the discipline of having to disclose the basis for the
schemes will concentrate the minds of companies. Moreover, the non-executive
directors who sit on remuneration committees will have the sobering thought
that if they nod through schemes that are too generous, they might find
themselves out of a job when reselection time comes round again.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Lloyd's calls egm vote on new funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON is to ask Names at an extraordinary general meeting to
approve plans to introduce new corporate investors to the insurance market.
The meeting, to be held on October 20, is designed to head off any action by
dissident loss-making Names that could delay the entry of new 'incorporated
Names'.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said in a letter to Names - the individuals
whose assets support the market - that Lloyd's wanted to 'clear the way for
new capital with certainty before the end of October'.
The Lloyd's council - the market's governing body - will consider on
September 8 a rulebook outlining the terms on which corporate capital can
participate in the market. Publication is expected soon afterwards.
The plans to attract corporate investors, announced in April, have caused
considerable controversy at the market. Last week dissident Names failed in
an attempt to force Lloyd's to press new investors to bail out loss-making
Names.
Several investment schemes to bring corporate capital have been developed by
UK and US banks but cannot go ahead until rules are approved.
Mr Rowland also said that Lloyd's had decided on the rules it would follow
if it needed to raise funds in the future through a special levy on members.
A vote by members would be required to approve the levy. Lloyd's said the
voting rights 'should be proportionate to the members' proportionate
capacity' - which would place more voting power in the hands of corporate
investors.
The Association of Lloyd's Members applauded the decision to make an early
decision on voting systems, and said it recognised the severe time pressures
in admitting new capital.
It called for ways to be found for any objections to the new terms for
corporate capital participation to be publicised before the meeting, as
members would be voting without debate on the subject.

A BALLOT which might resolve the 14-day-old Royal Mail dispute in Cardiff
has been delayed after confusion in the Union of Communication Workers.
Hopes of a settlement had been high after the UCW's national executive
agreed on Thursday to recommend a return to work on the basis of a framework
agreement negotiated between national officials and Royal Mail. The dispute
is over new fixed shift patterns.
Mr Derek Hodgson, deputy general secretary of the UCW, said yesterday that
the intention had been for national officers and local branch
representatives to hold a meeting in Cardiff on Saturday to explain to the
900 workers the progress made in the talks and to decide whether to proceed
with a ballot. He said many people did not attend, however, because of
confusion about whether the meeting was going ahead. A meeting is now
planned for today.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Bright spots among the tourism gloom: The industry's patchy
upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU KNOW the tourist industry's recession is over when lunchtime restaurant
customers run into double figures, says Mr Martin Cummings, owner of the Inn
on the Lake, in Godalming, Surrey.
Mr Cummings said that his 20-room inn and restaurant had just started
achieving lunchtime double figures. Room occupancy was up 5.2 per cent on
last summer.
Like their colleagues in the manufacturing sector, managers of tourist
establishments report an upturn but say that it is patchy.
Some say they could not survive without North American visitors, others that
the North Americans do not seem to have arrived this year.
The English Tourist Board said that it had heard contrasting stories of
success and gloom from different hotels in the same street.
Meanwhile Mr Brian Hughes, managing director of the St Andrews Golf Hotel in
St Andrews, Fife, said the recession in the south of England had led to a
sharp fall in guests from there. Business from the US and continental Europe
had been excellent.
At the other end of the country, Mr Cummings said that another of his
properties, the Amberley Castle country hotel, in Amberley, West Sussex, has
enjoyed a 37 per cent increase in occupancy in the past three months
compared with the same period last year.
Most tourism managers agree that business is better this summer than last,
although they have different views on how much better. Mrs Jane Randall,
tourism services officer for Stoke-on-Trent, said inquiries at the local
tourism information centre were running at 1,000 a day compared with 500 to
600 last summer.
The different experiences of tourist businesses partly reflect the uneven
nature of the upturn. They also reflect the fragmented nature of the UK
tourist industry.
Most companies are small and attract different types of visitor. Some
operate in markets which are less vulnerable to recession because their
clients are so well-off. Mr Hughes in St Andrews said that American and
continental European golfers tended to be wealthier than their UK
counterparts.
'You don't have to be well-off to play golf in Britain,' he said. 'The
British golfer tends to golf cheaply.' Foreign golfers come to Scotland in
good economic times and bad. 'Two points up or down in the exchange rates
doesn't affect them,' he said.
Stoke-on-Trent, home to ceramics companies such as Wedgwood, also tries to
attract high-spending foreign visitors. Mrs Randall said there were more
high-spenders this year than last. In 1992, the year after the Gulf war,
there were many cheap flights on offer in the US and the Americans who
visited the city did not have much money to spend.
She said wealthier Americans appeared to have returned this summer, along
with an increasing number of continental Europeans and visitors from as far
away as Venezuela.

THOMSON, THE UK market leader in foreign holidays, is suspending trips to
Russia because of an outbreak of diphtheria there.
All the company's city-breaks to Moscow and St Petersburg are being
cancelled from the start of next month and fares are being refunded.
Passengers due to travel this month are being offered refunds. They are
being told that they should be inoculated if they decide to go. The company
said hundreds of customers would be affected.
The Department of Health last month told travellers to Russia to ensure that
they were vaccinated.
Thomson said: 'In the last few weeks the situation seems to have worsened.'
But the Association of British Travel Agents said yesterday that it was safe
to travel with the proper immunisation.
Mr Keith Betton, Abta's head of corporate affairs, said: I would not advise
people to rush out and cancel because other companies may well take a
different view of this.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Business ebbs at English seaside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIRCHFIELD, on the promenade at Weston-super-Mare on the Bristol
Channel, is a 35-bedroomed Victorian hotel which 'by a fluke' has been full
this week, its owner Mr David Wright said.
On present bookings he expects it to be very quiet in a couple of weeks'
time.
In the resort as a whole, which has more than 6,000 hotel and self-catering
beds, the occupancy rate for July and this month is only about two-thirds.
Mr Wright, wearing his other hat as chairman of the town's hotels and
restaurants association, said this was much the same as last year, when the
number of bed-nights was 4 per cent down on the year before.
The poor weather 'has had a dampening effect on people deciding on impulse
to go away for the weekend. People are tending to book much later - if the
weather is good they may well book a UK holiday, if it is poor they may well
go into their travel agents and jet off to somewhere sunny,' he said.
Few people now stay as long as a fortnight. 'Holiday patterns are changing
dramatically. There is still a place for a week at an English seaside, but
for a typical family it is not their main holiday any more.'
Mr Wright said that Weston-super-Mare has suffered less than some resorts
from the downward trend because it is within reach of the Midlands with
motorway and rail links, and is a good touring centre. 'A lot of business
has become tours-orientated, which may be in May or June. It is not
necessarily true that July and August are the busiest weeks any more.'
While it waits for an upturn, the town has been investing in its Victorian
inheritance. 'Resorts are very fragile things,' he said. 'Once the rot sets
into a resort it very quickly slips away. That is not the case at Weston,
which is holding its own.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Rain lifts bookings for planes to Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Carrick, marketing director of Airtours, the Lancashire-based
package holiday group, has been delighted with the British weather this
summer. 'We've had 32 consecutive days of rain in Manchester. That's
marvellous for bookings,' he said.
A combination of poor UK weather, rising consumer confidence and weak
Mediterranean currencies has produced a good high season for companies
selling overseas holidays. This week sees the start of an industry campaign
to ensure that next summer is as successful.
Ms Rosemary Astles, marketing director of Thomson, the market leader, said
that Spain had increased its share of the UK market from 33 per cent last
summer to 37 per cent this year, aided by a weak peseta and heavy investment
in tourist facilities. She expected Spain to be as strong next year.
Tomorrow Thomson launches its summer 1994 programme, and over the next few
weeks rivals such as Owners Abroad and Airtours will follow suit.
The launch of Thomson's summer brochure has traditionally been seen as the
opening move in a price war. Thomson is confident, however, that the
industry has entered a more settled period.
Fierce price-cutting has not occurred this summer. Ms Astles said this was
partly because operators were more realistic about initial prices. They
offered reductions to those who booked 1993 trips during the Christmas
period last year, and then set prices that were low enough to attract
continued pre-booking. The result is that while the number of summer holiday
bookings has been 5 per cent higher than last year, average prices have not
risen.
Thomas Cook, the chain of travel agents, said that the poor UK weather kept
demand for foreign holidays high to the end of September and enabled
companies to maintain prices. Mr Carrick said the industry was now also more
skilled at ensuring that supply did not outstrip demand.
Smaller companies have another explanation for stability in the industry.
Independent operators say that large groups such as Thomson and Airtours,
which own large chains of travel agents, have used these retail chains to
boost sales of their own holidays at the expense of smaller companies.
Airtours recently acquired the Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson retail
outlets and made it clear that it would use them to promote its own
products. Industry managers say Thomson - which has owned Lunn Poly for two
decades and until recently ran the chain at arm's length - has responded by
using Lunn Poly in the same way.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Battered Porsche recalls its image for urgent repairs: The
car importer's effort to reverse its reputation for arrogance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORSCHE IS seeking to re-establish traditional customer loyalties in the UK
after acknowledging that it has paid a high price for past arrogance.
In 1987 a record 3,700 of the German-built sportscars found their way to UK
customers. By last year sales had fallen to 945.
The importer, which has its headquarters in Reading, Berkshire, has
completed a restructuring of its operations. As a result it has started a
campaign to return to its roots in the sportscar enthusiast market and away
from its former 'status symbol' image of the 1980s boom years.
The perception of arrogance within the carmaker and its wholly owned UK
sales subsidiary, Porsche Cars Great Britain, emerged in market research
commissioned by Mr Kevin Gaskell, managing director of the British operation
for the past 15 months.
The study was 'the first customer research we had commissioned for years',
Mr Gaskell said.
'But in concluding that we were perceived as arrogant it was only telling us
what we already knew. There was a time when not only were we not listening
to what the world was telling us, we weren't even listening to ourselves.'
The image portrayed in the research was that Porsche and its 28 dealers were
aloof purveyors of high-priced cars rapidly losing their competitive edge
against a growing number of rivals, particularly from Japan. It was seen as
increasingly out of touch with the enthusiast market which has sustained
Porsche for most of its history following its creation soon after the second
world war.
Even the Porsche Cars GB headquarters give the impression of a status
symbol. The high-tech, Pounds 13m building clad in black smoked glass was
erected on Reading's outskirts in the mid-1980s and designed to be capable
of preparing and distributing 6,000 new Porsches a year. Its full capacity
as an import centre has never been much more than half-used. Nor does
Porsche expect 6,000 sales a year in the UK in the foreseeable future.
Thus, as part of the restructuring, it has turned part of its headquarters
into a dealership and has set up a new division, Porsche Special Products.
An important function of PSP is to provide a renovation and maintenance
service for the 36,000-strong Porsche population in the UK. More than half
of all Porsches built are still on the road.
Staffing levels have been cut dramatically. The headquarters employs only 90
people on all activities compared with more than 200 in 1988. In terms of
the import business, financial breakeven has been reduced from 2,200 annual
sales two years ago to 700.
The company is also launching initiatives to make parts and service costs
more competitive in an attempt to wrest back business lost to non-franchised
parts and service outlets.
Mr Gaskell acknowledged that there were 16 such enterprises operating in the
greater London area alone.
He said: 'It's up to us to find that crossover point between quality and
cost where that business will come back to us'.
Porsche Cars GB is on course to lift sales back above the 1,000 mark this
year. Sales of the 911 model, heavily updated in its 30th year, are up
sharply. The next really substantial sales boost is likely to come with the
986, an all-new car based on the Boxster concept car - which Porsche
unveiled late last year - to be launched in the mid-1990s.
Mr Gaskell said the company could have sold 2,000 cars in the UK last year,
but that would have meant embroiling itself more heavily in discount wars
with the risk of further damage to resale values.
Little could be more indicative of the new humility at Porsche than one of
the first cars waiting for renovation by the Special Products division.
It is a decrepit, badly rusted 911 Targa. 'Its owner has given us a budget
of Pounds 4,000 to restore it. We welcome the work and will turn it back
into something he can be proud of,' Mr Gaskell said.
He readily acknowledged that there was still a public perception that a
Porsche dealer would barely bother to hold a door open for such a sum. But
that image, he insisted, was out of date. 'We can do a lot for Pounds
4,000.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Director with direct line to the boss: Simon Weinstock is a
GEC board member - his father is MD of the group. The perils of following in
a parent's footsteps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE first mention of his father Mr Simon Weinstock pulls his shoulders
back, sits upright in his chair and says: 'If my father was not here I would
not be here. I have to be quite open about that.'
By his own admission, the 41-year-old scion has no obvious qualifications to
be a director of General Electric Company with responsibility for
acquisitions and GEC Marconi, the group's defence arm.
He qualified neither as an accountant nor as an industrial manager. But he
does have the ear of his father, Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director.
It is this, more than anything else, which guarantees him a unique position
on the board of one of Britain's biggest companies, with annual sales of
Pounds 9.4bn. As a fellow director explains: 'Arnold does not move without
consulting Simon first.'
If this bothered him in the past, and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest
it was a reason for his shyness, it no longer causes him concern.
When he joined the board six years ago he was described by some of his
colleagues as at times petulant, shy and often anxious not to be continually
thought of as the son of Lord Weinstock. Now they say he has become more
relaxed, confident and delighted to be seen as the son of Lord Weinstock.
The softly spoken Mr Weinstock now has a friendly, if still awkward, manner.
He cannot think of a single disadvantage of being the boss's son. He
dismisses the accusation of nepotism as ridiculous. 'GEC is not a family
business, has never been run on those lines and never will be,' he says.
The advantages, however, are numerous. Perhaps most important, he knows how
to dodge the pitfalls of working for a managing director who can have an
intimidating, even threatening, presence. 'I know what he is looking for and
what he does not want to see,' says Mr Weinstock.
This gives him an edge over other GEC senior executives, who often ask him
to intervene in their dealings with Lord Weinstock. 'It depends on the
situation, but it can be daunting for some people to deal with my father
alone. I will then get involved.'
He says he has an excellent relationship with his father. They share many
interests such as a love of music, regularly visiting the Salzburg festival
and La Scala Opera House in Milan, and a passion for horse racing.
Perhaps most surprising is Mr Weinstock's contention that his father never
put any pressure on him to join the company. After working at SG Warburg,
the merchant bank, first in advising the government on rescheduling debt and
then on the investment side, he thought it was time for a change.
'With a certain amount of trepidation I decided to work for GEC. My father
was pleased but he put no pressure on me to join the company. If he had not
wanted me to come then I would have done something else.'
Lord Weinstock may not have pressed his son to join him, but he appeared
keen that he should succeed him three years after Mr Weinstock was appointed
to the board as commercial director in 1987.
Asked on Channel 4's Answering Back programme whether he would like to be
succeeded by his son, he said: 'Of course I would like it, but only on
condition that it fulfilled his life and not that he did something to please
me.'
He added, however, that it would be for GEC's senior managers to choose his
successor and it would be up to his son to decide whether he wanted the job.
There is little doubt that Mr Weinstock would like to take over from his
father, although he adds a third condition: the institutional investors
would have to want him for the job.
'I would not want to do it unless I could do it and the senior management
and shareholders wanted me to do it.'
Mr Weinstock, regarded by many in GEC as the leading internal candidate,
warns of the difficulties of bringing in an outsider. 'It would be hard for
someone to come from another company to lead this one, but not impossible.
Companies generally prefer to promote from within.'
He is backed in this view by some key executive directors. One says: 'The
boss's son imposes himself more naturally.' Sir Ronald Grierson, a former
vice-chairman of GEC who remains on the board of GEC International, one of
the group's subsidiaries, says: 'There is no prima facie reason to assume
that dynastic succession is worse than any other kind of succession. I even
happen to believe that, other things being relatively equal, continuation of
management by the founder's family can be a good recipe.'
Yet a number of the group's shareholders say there is no question of Mr
Weinstock succeeding his father. A senior fund manager says: 'It is unlikely
that Simon Weinstock will emerge as his father's successor. It would look
like a massive piece of nepotism. There is an inbuilt inclination from
investors not to want him however good he is.'
Another says: 'No one should try and stop Arnold's ambition for his son to
become boss. But I am not sure his father would want him sacrificed on the
altar of GEC.'
Mr Weinstock, sensitive to both views, alludes to the possibility that the
top job could be split when his father, who is 69, decides to retire.
Since 1989 GEC has formed joint ventures with Alsthom of France in power
engineering, Siemens of Germany in telecommunications and General Electric
of the US in consumer appliances. This, says Mr Weinstock, has transformed
GEC into a different company from the one his father has been running for
most of his working life.
'A large chunk of our business is now in joint ventures and there will
probably be more of this than less. In the long term the management
structure may be different. We need to be flexible about it.'
But Mr Weinstock is in no hurry for a chance to take over at GEC. He says
that while his father remains at the helm he is content with his job on the
board, and he sleeps better at night knowing that he is making a
contribution to the company in which he holds 31m shares.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Industry pay rises at 16-year low, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY RISES in manufacturing industry averaged 2.3 per cent in the second
quarter, the Confederation of British Industry reported yester-day.
It was the lowest quarterly figure recorded by the CBI since its records
began in 1977.
It compares with 2.5 per cent in the first three months of the year and 4
per cent in the second quarter of last year.
Service company pay awards in the second quarter this year provisionally
averaged 2.9 per cent.
The CBI said there was no evidence of a bottoming out in the level of pay
settlements or that workers in companies which imposed pay freezes in
1991-92 were 'catching up', with large rises to compensate for the freezes.
Manufacturers settling during the second quarter reported productivity gains
averaging 3.8 per cent. Although the fall in unit labour costs for the
second quarter is expected to be 2.6 per cent, down from a fall of 3 per
cent in the first quarter, the overall fall is better than Germany, France,
Japan and the US.
Research by the CBI Pay Databank has found that in 1992-93 the average
increase in companies which froze pay in the previous year was 2.1 per cent.
This was lower than the average Databank increase of 3.4 per cent.
The CBI says: 'Therefore there is little evidence to suggest that there has
been a wave of 'catch-up' awards in 1992-93, and the evidence strengthens
the position of public-sector managers facing possible 'catch-up' claims
after the government's 1.5 per cent limit.'
Only 88 Databank companies froze pay for 12 months or more in 1991-92. The
freezes hit non-manual employees more than manual employees, and were
concentrated in the retail and business services sector, although
manufacturing was also affected.
The highest proportion of freezes was in the south-east and the west
Midlands.
Pay freezes of less than 12 months are widespread, affecting about one in
three manufacturers and one in four service-sector companies.
The latest CBI employment affairs report says that, in spite of all the
changes in the law in recent years, the number of employees 'actively taken
out of the collective bargaining net has so far remained relatively low'.
The report says that the decline in union membership and recognition is more
the result of the failure of unions to colonise greenfield sites and small
companies in the services sector.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Nadir investigator 'probed tax affairs of minister'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue investigator blamed by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive
businessman, for his downfall also probed the tax affairs of a government
minister, it is claimed today.
Mr Michael Allcock headed the Revenue's crack investigative unit Special
Office 2, known as The Ghostbusters. SO2 probed the tax affairs of wealthy
City businessmen including Mr Nadir, who jumped bail in May and fled to
northern Cyprus.
Mr Allcock was suspended from the Revenue last September, and was arrested
and questioned by police last month but released without charges.
In an interview with ITV's World In Action, to be screened tonight, Mr
Allcock tells how a stockbroker informant tipped him off that a government
minister was implicated in offshore tax frauds. Mr Allcock says he tried to
examine the politician's tax files before he was suspended.
However, Mr Allcock refuses to name the minister. 'I cannot comment on
that,' he says, adding that although he is suspended he is 'still a civil
servant and it is quite improper for me to talk about individual cases'.
Mr Allcock also tells how his team launched a large-scale investigation,
named The Stock Exchange Project, into alleged tax dodges by City business
people.
The dodges involved depositing the profits from share dealings in the
accounts of bogus companies based in offshore tax havens.
In order to avoid tax, the people involved would bring suitcases full of
money back to Britain.
Mr Allcock says: 'Somebody would go on a plane, go to Jersey or Switzerland
with a briefcase and draw the money in cash and bring it back.'

CIVIL SERVANTS at the Export Credits Guarantee Department's main office near
Tower Bridge in London will stage a one-day strike today in protest at a

The CPSA, which will be taking action with the NUCPS, the other main Civil

too many support staff working at the ECGD, which provides export

FT  16 AUG 93 / Builders report summer upturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY in the housing market has picked up again after concern that it
might be faltering, the House Builders Federation reported yesterday. It
said reservations had improved in the normally lean month of July after the
pace of recovery slowed in the previous two months.
Mr Tony Hillier, federation president, said: 'I am certainly encouraged by
these figures, particularly as the increase in reservations has come during
summer, always the leanest of housebuying times.'
The balance in the federation's survey between companies reporting a rise in
net reservations and those reporting a decline compared with 1992 was 25 per
cent in July compared with 19 per cent in June and 27 per cent in May.
The survey also says that 68 per cent of housebuilders surveyed expect their
sales to increase this year.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Private plans for child offenders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to press ahead with plans to establish private-sector
homes for dangerous children, shrugging off Labour comparisons with the
troubled privatisation of the prison escort service.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, will publish a consultation paper
today recommending a change in the law to allow private and voluntary
organisations to offer accommodation. Officials said the proposals followed
a rise in the cost of local authority provision of secure accommodation,
which was reserved for children convicted of serious crimes who were too
young to be sent to prison. The average cost of a local authority place is
Pounds 1,680 a week.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the proposals fell into the
same bracket as the 'farcical' transfer of the prison escort service to
Group 4, which has suffered several embarrassing escapes by prisoners.
'A privatised service can only be profitable if it relies on larger units
that often become colleges of crime,' he said.
Ms Liz Lynne, Liberal Democrat community care spokeswoman, said: 'This is
just another crazy scheme that could end up in catastrophe.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Drive on benefits fraud nets Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRACKDOWNS against fraud involving social benefits saved the taxpayer a
record Pounds 500m last year, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
said yesterday, Emma Tucker writes. He said 90 per cent of the 270,000
individual benefit recipients found to be cheating the system had been
successfully prosecuted.
Last week the Department of Employment announced a Pounds 45m saving from
investigations into unemployment benefit fraud. The cases highlighted by the
DSS were similar, but it administers a much wider range of benefits,
including sickness and invalidity payments, income support and housing
benefit.
Mr Lilley said savings on false claims had risen by Pounds 100m in the past
12 months. 'While the vast majority of claims are genuine, these figures
show that there are large numbers of people who make fraudulent claims,' he
said.
The DSS said the main areas of fraud were centred on income-related benefits
such as income support and housing benefit administered by local
authorities, as well as short-term benefits such as invalidity benefit.
The prosecutions included 59 minicab drivers in Gravesend, Kent, who were
signing on for benefits, 28 false claims for child benefit in Washington,
Tyne and Wear, involving 62 fictitious children, and a Bolton man who
pretended that his wife was his sister in order to carry on claiming
means-tested benefit.

FT  16 AUG 93 / University cash crisis highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD disappointment among applicants for university places after the
publication of A-level results next week will intensify pressure for
universities to be given extra sources of funding.
This follows a record high number of applications and a cut in government
funding - particularly for arts courses - which was not announced until most
universities had already made A-level offers.
Next week the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals will publish a
report on four alternative methods to raise extra funds for higher
education.
These include student loans to be repaid through income tax once students
are employed, or an increase in the level of income tax applicable only to
graduates.
Applications to UK universities as a whole have increased by between 6 per
cent and 7 per cent, while the increase for 'old' universities - those other
than institutions upgraded from polytechnics last year - was 9 per cent.
Yet no funding has been made available to accommodate an increase in
numbers. Instead, the government cut the tuition fees it would pay for each
student in 'classroom-based courses' (excluding laboratory-based and applied
subjects) from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300.
This decision followed a swift expansion in which the number of students in
higher education increased by 46 per cent over four years. The government is
now aiming for a period of 'consolidation'.
As a result, according to the Universities Central Council on Admissions
(Ucca), tutors will be 'very tight' in vetting applications and many
universities will demand a much more precise match between candidates'
A-level grades and the grade standard expected by the universities.
While all offers of a place must be honoured if the conditions have been
met, there is likely to be no flexibility in dealing with candidates who
narrowly miss their offer, or who achieve the correct grades but not in the
subjects stipulated.
The Polytechnics Central Admissions System (PCAS), which covers the
universities upgraded in the past year, said the tightening followed years
of systematic 'over-recruitment'. It said several institutions had already
announced that no places would be available for classroom-based courses via
the clearing process.
The PCAS attacked the entire admissions system as 'flawed'. Mr Tony Higgins,
chief executive, said conditional offers should be abandoned in favour of a
fairer system in which applicants waited for their A-level results before
applying. University terms would then start in November.
He said: 'Applications should be based on known, not speculative,
attainments.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Companies confident on productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPETITIVENESS of British industry will continue to improve because of
the impact of high unemployment on wage costs and labour flexibility, a
survey by the 3i venture-capital group says today.
Responses from 1,000 finance directors of the UK's biggest public companies
show them to be overwhelmingly confident that industry will continue to
narrow the productivity gap with the world's most efficient economies, and
that the benefits of last year's devaluation can be sustained.
Respondents cited high unemployment and wider public awareness of the need
to retain competitiveness as explanations for their confidence.
More than two-thirds of the finance directors said the competitive gains of
devaluation would not be whittled away.
Mr John Platt, executive director of 3i, said: 'There is every sign that
1993 will show a rise in productivity higher than any we have seen since the
early 1980s.'
The group's findings follow government figures showing that unit labour
costs are falling, while productivity has reached its highest levels for 6
1/2 years.
Manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 3 per cent lower in
the three months to June than in the same period a year before.
Manufacturing productivity - output per head - was 1.3 per cent higher in
the second quarter compared with the first, and 8.2 per cent higher than in
the same three-month period a year earlier.
Mr Platt said: 'Finance directors view these improvements as a change in the
fundamentals of British industry, not as a short-term windfall resulting
from the recession.'
The directors said a sharper focus on core activities and increased capital
investment had contributed to higher productivity.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Recovery fails to boost start-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC recovery has not yet stimulated growth in the number of
business start-ups, says National Westminster Bank.
The NatWest quarterly start-up index, published today, shows that about
90,000 companies started trading in the second quarter of this year. This
compares with 95,000 in the first three months and 100,000 in the second
quarter of last year.
The total of 185,000 for the first six months of this year is unchanged on
the figure for the second half of last year.
Mrs Jane Bradford, head of NatWest small-business services, said: 'Although
there are signs that recovery in the small-business sector is under way, the
recession has hit small firms hard and, as a result, they are still very
cautious about future prospects.'
She forecast that, if small-business confidence continues to grow, about
370,000 companies would start trading this year. There were 400,000
start-ups last year.
Sole traders made up 60 per cent of start-ups in this year's second quarter,
compared with 50 per cent for the same period in 1987. New businesses took
on an average of four full-time staff, compared with five in 1987's second
quarter.
'Owners are thinking very carefully about the commitments they are prepared
to take on, especially when other people's livelihoods are at risk as well
as their own,' Mrs Bradford said. 'On average they say that they spend
nearly eight months planning their business venture before they actually
start up.'

FT  16 AUG 93 / Mail union mix-up delays decision on peace deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BALLOT which might resolve the 14-day-old Royal Mail dispute in Cardiff
has been delayed after confusion in the Union of Communication Workers.
Hopes of a settlement had been high after the UCW's national executive
agreed on Thursday to recommend a return to work on the basis of a framework
agreement negotiated between national officials and Royal Mail.
Mr Derek Hodgson, deputy general secretary of the UCW, said yesterday that
the intention had been for national officers, accompanied by local branch
representatives, to hold a meeting in Cardiff on Saturday to explain to the
900 workers the progress made in the talks and to decide whether to proceed
with a ballot.
He said that a substantial number of people did not attend, however, because
of confusion between the head office and the branch about whether the
meeting was going ahead.
A meeting is now planned for today.
At issue has been the introduction of new fixed shift patterns for workers
at two Royal Mail offices to replace the roster system, a change that has
taken place already in a large part of Royal Mail.
The strike has paralysed delivery of more than one million letters and
hundreds of companies in south Wales have had to make alternative
arrangements, such as posting letters outside Cardiff and investing in fax
equipment.
Mr Graham Hall, head of Cardiff Chamber of Commerce, said that a number of
companies were having financial problems. 'They cannot pay their suppliers
as they are not receiving payment from their customers.'

Ten Moslem fundamentalists in Jordan are to be charged with plotting to
assassinate King Hussein at a university ceremony last June, writes James
Whittington in Amman.
In April, 31 students and staff from Mu'ta University were arrested. All
were suspected members of the banned Islamic Liberation party. Twenty-three
have been released, but security sources confirm that the remaining eight,
along with two other suspects still at large, will be charged with treason,
an offence punishable by death.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 400 deported Palestinians, who have spent eight months stranded in
no-man's-land between Israel and south Lebanon, yesterday accepted an
Israeli offer of a phased return, writes David Horovitz from Jerusalem.
About half will return next month, with the rest returning at the end of the
year. The deportees, mostly linked to the fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic
Jihad movements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, were expelled last
December after six Israeli soldiers had been killed in the occupied
territories.
Until yesterday, the deportees had insisted Israel take back all or none of
them.

Seasonally adjusted data used in all cases. Statistics for Germany apply
only to western Germany. GDP/GNP is broken down into private consumption
expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and
the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net
exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and
services). The US includes investment by government in the government
series rather than under investment. Quarterly GDP/GNP totals are
annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the
corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless
otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth
rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied

PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida is expected to end uncertainty over the make-up
of the proposed interim government when he addresses Nigeria's national
assembly in the capital Abuja tonight.
Government officials have speculated that the new administration will
contain about six military commanders but will be led by a civilian, with
the possibility that President Babangida could retire from the army and
remain in office.
It has also been suggested that the new government will be subject to a
higher military council and will lack power, as was the case with the
outgoing transitional council appointed in January.
Nigeria's three-day strike, which ended on Saturday, showed that
pro-democracy groups can defy the military regime by peaceful protest in
Lagos and the south-west, but cannot rally support in the rest of the
country.
The Campaign for Democracy (CD), the loose association of civil liberties
groups which is behind the civil protest, claim the arrest without trial of
three of their leaders, including chairman Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, closure of
some of the independent press and the passing of some repressive decrees
have left Nigerians more politicised in the past two months than in 10 years
of military rule.
The CD's unconditional rejection of the interim government commands support
in the south-west, the Yoruba homeland of Chief Moshood Abiola, victorious
candidate in the annulled June poll.
Mr Abiola, who fled to Britain 12 days ago, said he planned to return home
soon.
'On August 24, I will be 56. I expect to be in Nigeria to celebrate my
birthday,' said Mr Abiola, adding that there were no circumstances in which
he would withdraw his claim to be Nigeria's legitimate leader as a result of
the June 12 poll.

TO JUDGE BY the rhetoric of economic commentary, almost every mbig ajor
economy is in dire straits. The US recovery is heading from anaemic to
'seriously in doubt' in the pundit's lexicon. Recessionary Japan is
meanwhile on the verge of a 'double dip'. The effects of Germany's deepening
recession are spreading across the continent. Only the British economy,
despite setbacks to its nascent recovery, has 'defied the sceptics' over the
past six months. But the conventional economic wisdom is more than usually
misleading.
The US economy has been diffident about recovering because, at least by past
US standards, it had a short dose of recession to recover from. Federal
reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's move to cut interest rates in 1990 spared
the US a lengthy period of negative growth. Output fell by just 2.2 per cent
between the second quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991. It has
since more than recovered this lost ground, as the chart shows. But American
consumers had only a year to correct their debt-laden balance sheets before
they were expected to begin the cycle all over again. After this brief
period of retrenchment, the fact that personal sector debts remain
equivalent to 100 per cent of disposable income, compared with 75 per cent
in 1980, makes for a restrained upturn.
The UK recovery, while also held back by personal sector debts, may prove
faster than America's. But once again, the chart puts matters in
perspective. The UK is currently recovering from two years of falling output
and high nominal interest rates. UK output fell by 4 per cent between the
second quarter of 1990 and the second quarter of 1992 and has not yet
returned to its level at the beginning of 1989.
Japan's record does not look too bad when judged against this rather dismal
Anglo-Saxon performance, Despite last week's worries about a 'double dip',
Japan has barely had a single dip worth noting. Japanese output fell by a
mere 0.6 per cent between the second and third quarters of 1992. It has
risen by 14 per cent since the end of 1988.
Only Germany's recent performance fits the rhetoric. Since the first quarter
of last year, west German output has fallen by 2.8 per cent. Even so, this
fall followed a dramatic period of post-unification growth. Between the fall
of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 and the onset of recession, output rose by
9.9 per cent. And France and Italy, while facing a difficult year, have not
experienced anything like the falls in output that debt-burdened America and
Britain have suffered.
So why this need to describe every economy with the same doom-laden
language? Headline writers are partly to blame. But politics also plays a
role.
In Britain, government politicians have been relieved at the pace of
recovery, even though economists remain sceptical about its staying power.
Across the Atlantic, things are less comfortable. President Bill Clinton,
like Mr Bush before him, faces a politically potent gap between economic
performance and expectation. To fill it, the new resident at the White House
has turned abroad - to Germany and Japan - to provide the boost to demand
which US public opinion demands.
Mr Clinton's quest for growth has had some success. The Bundesbank is still
holding out against US and European demands for further German interest rate
cuts. But Japan's current account surplus has proved an easier target.
Though foreign trade accounts for only around 11 per cent of American GDP,
US Treasury officials have successfully exhorted the Japanese government to
boost their domestic economy through higher public spending and further cuts
in interest rates.
The Clinton administration has a point: the Japanese economy is losing
momentum, less government saving and more demand for imports is the best way
to cut the trade surplus, and boosting Japanese domestic demand might help
the US recovery along. But the chart makes attempts to fault Japan's recent
contribution to world growth seem a little short-termist.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Shortest of honeymoons for Hosokawa: The Japanese prime
minister's need to serve many political aces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MORIHIRO Hosokawa is on holiday. A week can be a long time in politics,
and the reformist patrician sworn in last Monday as Japan's prime minister
has given himself a summer break at the end of it. Spending a few days
north-west of Tokyo playing tennis and reading, he can bask in approval
ratings put by opinion polls at around 75 per cent.
But the evidence of the week is that holding together the seven parties in
his coalition will be nothing other than hard work.
The seven have failed to agree on the core issue of which electoral system
should replace the current multi-seat constituencies. These are blamed for
engendering corruption as candidates spend money competing with others with
whom they have no party or ideological differences.
The system being mooted mixes deputies elected by single-seat voting
districts, and by a nationwide party tally under proportional
representation. Seven party mathematicians have worked out the most
favourable outcome for each, and no mechanism has yet been found which will
avoid electoral hara-kiri for at least one of the partners.
A decision has been put off until after Mr Hosokawa, founder of the year-old
Japan New party who has staked his future on delivering political reform by
the end of the year, gives a policy speech to the Diet a week today.
In the meantime, other issues have been highlighting the fragility of the
alliance grouping Socialists, Buddhists and those who defected from the
Liberal Democratic party towards the end of its 38-year conservative rule.
Mr Hosokawa put down his racquet yesterday to join Emperor Akihito at the
government's annual ceremony marking the surrender of Japanese imperial
forces at the end of the second world war. The premier offered his
condolences to Asian victims of the country's aggression, the first holder
of his office to do so in so formal a manner.
Leaders of the left-wing Social Democratic party, largest member of the
coalition, showed up for the first time.
But down the road, four of his cabinet paid their respects at the Yasukuni
shrine to the memory of Japan's own war dead, including those deemed war
criminals.
They were all from the Japan Renewal party formed by more recent - and, some
believe, relatively unreconstructed - LDP departees.
An admission by the LDP, on its final day in office, that the army dragooned
so-called comfort women into providing sexual services in occupied countries
has sparked debate about how much more Japan needs to atone for past wrongs.
One report yesterday said Mr Hosokawa was contemplating setting aside as
much as Y1,000bn (Pounds 6.7bn) as a war legacy for its Asian neighbours.
Such a sum would be likely to cause palpitations among Finance Ministry
bureaucrats trying to restrain government spending as the country's economic
slowdown knocks tax revenues.
Ministers will have to preside in the next few weeks over arguments about
whether cuts in income tax and compensatory increases in VAT will better
stimulate demand - an idea to which the SDP is deeply hostile - as well as
whether to pass on to consumers the benefits of the stronger yen on energy
prices.
Income for the country's political parties themselves is under review. The
government wants to abolish corporate donations, and apparently won a
convert yesterday in Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, Japan's
largest business grouping. He is proposing an end to contributions, put at
Y13bn a year which went largely to the LDP.
The Social Democrats are expected to protest if the debate extends to the
trade union contributions with which it is largely funded. The SDP is anyway
engaged in an awkward perioid of introspection following an announcement on
Thursday by Mr Sadao Yamahana, its chairman, that he would submit to a
leadership contest.
Mr Yamahana, a moderate, is also minister in charge of political reform in
the new government.
If he is ousted by a challenger from the SDP left, which is less than
comfortable with its coalition partners, Mr Hosokawa's arithmetic could be
altered dramatically.
The prime minister is on vacation until Thursday, but his political
honeymoon may already be over.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Cairo military trial begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER and SHAHIRA IDRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A defendant raises the Koran in defiance from behind prison bars during the
first session of a Cairo military trial yesterday.
Fifty-three Moslem militants are accused of belonging to an illegal
organisation plotting to overthrow the Egyptian government, Reuter reports.
Earlier a Cairo civilian court at the weekend acquitted 24 alleged Moslem
militants who were accused of murdering parliamentary speaker Mr Riffat
Mahgoub, who was gunned down together with five of his bodyguards in October
1990, adds Shahira Idris.
The State Security Court cleared 14 of the defendents on all charges and
jailed the remaining 10 for terms ranging from three to 15 years for
possession of arms, forging documents and other related charges.
The verdict was in sharp contrast to the 15 death sentences passed by
military courts on Moslem fundamentalists in the past two months.
After a spate of terrorist attacks by Moslem extremists, resulting in the
death of over 170 people in the last 18 months, the Egyptian government has
resorted to military courts in cases involving Moslem militants to ensure
harsh and swift sentences.

FT  16 AUG 93 / South Korea shares continue to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean stock market fell for a second day on Saturday in response
to an immediate ban on anonymous financial transactions, but there were
indications that investor panic at the measure could subside this week,
writes John Burton in Seoul.
The general share index fell to 666 on Saturday, an 8 per cent drop since
Thursday, when the anti-corruption action was announced.
The fall on the market was caused by investors liquidating their false-name
accounts to move their funds elsewhere and avoid paying taxes.
But analysts noted that trading volume at 21.2m shares was up sharply from
Friday's 1.3m shares, indicating that institutional investors were entering
the market to take advantage of buying opportunities.
Meanwhile, gold prices and the black market dollar rate stabilised. It had
been expected that holders of false-name accounts would rush to acquire gold
and illegal dollars in an attempt to hide money from the tax authorities.
The property market was calm after officials said they would need to approve
all transactions for the next three months to prevent the flow of hidden
money into that sector.
Cash withdrawals from banks were reported to be at normal levels, with few
customers shifting false-name accounts to ones held under their real names
as required under the new rules.
Sales of safes fell sharply, however, as the government announced that it
would track buyers who could possibly use them to conceal their assets.
Most lenders on the unofficial kerb market, which is largely financed by the
money held in the false-name accounts, remained closed.
Small and medium-sized businesses depend heavily on the kerb market for
financing, but the virtual closure of the kerb market has not so far
affected their operations.
The central bank reported that few businesses were requesting the emergency
loans which had been offered by government to prevent possible bankruptcies
resulting from the introduction of the real-name system.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Beijing puts new clamps on media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has announced additional restrictions on news dissemination in a clear
sign that as part of the current austerity drive the authorities are also
intent on reining in the local media.
The State Council, or cabinet, warned in the new regulations, issued at the
weekend, against the holding of unauthorised news conferences, and urged the
press to concentrate on 'positive news'.
The State Council circular stated that news conferences should focus on
'important issues' such as promoting 'economic and spiritual civilisation'.
The crackdown on the spread of information coincides with attempts by the
central government to regain control of the economy under a new
stabilisation plan introduced last month.
It also comes amid signs of a sterner attitude towards art and literature
generally with the banning late last month of the award-winning film,
Farewell To My Concubine. The authorities have given no reason for the ban,
but members of the leadership are believed to have been incensed by the
film's negative portrayal of the Communist party.
The State Council circular also warned against the leaking of 'party and
state secrets', using language reminiscent of an earlier, less liberal era.
The new regulations follow measures introduced this month to penalise
severely journalists who accepted bribes or other financial inducements  -
what was described at the time as 'newswriting for illicit payment'.
The authorities were reacting to the fairly widespread practice of Chinese
journalists accepting money to write flattering articles about companies and
their products.
Tighter restrictions on the media coincide with attempts by Beijing to
combat corruption, fight tax evasion, and counter rampant smuggling across
China's borders.
The Bank of China, the country's central bank, will issue its first Hong
Kong dollars next May, one of its vice chairman was quoted as saying
yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The initial volume was expected to be in the region of HKDollars 3bn to
HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 258m to Pounds 517m), Mr Huang Diyan told the Xinhua
news agency.
Until now, the British colony's dollars have been issued only by the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Bank Corp (HKSBC) and the Standard Chartered Bank. A
British colony since 1842, Hong Kong becomes a Chinese special
administrative region on July 1 1997.
Mr Huang said all the necessary legal procedures for the issue were
completed, leaving only technicalities to sort out.
'We sincerely hope that the Hong Kong Bank, Standard Chartered and other
international banks will stay and develop in Hong Kong on a long-term basis,
so as to jointly work toward the prosperity of Hong Kong's financial market
and consolidate and further promote its status as an international financial
centre,' he said.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Acquittal clouds future of BCCI case: Altman case raises
fundamental questions about bank fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE acquittal on Saturday of Mr Robert Altman was a serious blow to the
prosecutors who have been toiling for years on the case from the office of
Mr Robert Morgenthau, the respected Manhattan district attorney who has led
the world in tackling the corruption at BCCI.
The development also raises fundamental questions for US law enforcement
officials that are both specific and general in the BCCI case. First, there
is the issue of where to go from here on BCCI. Then there is the broader
matter of how bank regulators and prosecutors can best tackle international
bank fraud when it transcends national boundaries.
The joint indictment 13 months ago of Mr Altman and of Mr Clark Clifford,
the former US defence secretary, was the high-water mark in the campaign to
prosecute those suspected of involvement in BCCI's 20-year history of fraud
and deception.
In the US the leadership on BCCI came from Mr Morgenthau, partly because the
Bush administration's Department of Justice had been noticeably lethargic on
the case.
The 86-year-old Mr Clifford has been able to avoid trial thus far on the
grounds that he is too ill to come to court. Charges against him have been
deferred, and few in Washington expect him ever to go to trial. Separate
charges against both Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were lodged in Washington,
but these too might be dropped as a result of the New York acquittal.
A number of the key BCCI figures who have been indicted in the US, including
Mr Sweleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, are meanwhile in Abu Dhabi
or other places beyond the reach of the US.
It is thus unclear, aside from appealing against the Altman conviction, how
Mr Morgenthau's office will proceed from here. There is a real risk that
those BCCI officials involved in the more shocking acts of corruption will
ultimately escape trial anywhere.
In broader terms, the Altman acquittal highlights the difficulty of policing
the international financial markets when no single regulator is in charge of
monitoring specific institutions.
After the BCCI trial's collapse in New York, the next important
international banking scandal to find its way to US courts will be the trial
next month of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of the Atlanta
branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The BNL case is very
different, however.
Mr Drogoul is accused of defrauding the US government and BNL's Rome head
office by making more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) of improper loans to
Iraq.
The difference, however, is that Mr Drogoul, joined by investigators in the
US Congress and the Italian parliament, has claimed the Atlanta loans were
secretly countenanced by the US and Italian governments as part of the tilt
towards Mr Saddam Hussein.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Brazil names third bank governor in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's chief debt negotiator has been named the country's new central bank
governor in yet another shuffle of key economic personnel after a public
clash between President Itamar Franco and the former governor.
Mr Pedro Malan returns from Washington to replace Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes,
whose turbulent five months as governor came to an end on Friday night. Mr
Ximenes resigned along with the whole of the bank's board after a dispute
with the president over the validity of predated cheques written before the
country's recent change of currency. But the two had repeatedly come to
blows over Mr Franco's low interest rate policy.
Although the business community was irritated by yet another change in the
economic team - there have been three central bank governors and five
finance ministers in the past year - the choice of Mr Malan was generally
welcomed, as was the accompanying announcement by Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, the finance minister, that interest rates are to drop.
Mr Malan is considered to have done a masterful job at negotiating a Brady
deal for restructuring Brazil's Dollars 44bn (Pounds 29.5bn) commercial debt
amid the country's economic crisis. The deal is due to be completed on
November 30 though the timing could be jeopardised by the country's
continuing failure to reach a new accord with the International Monetary
Fund.
Mr Malan has excellent relations with the international financial community,
having lived for 10 years in Washington, where he has worked for the World
Bank and Inter-American Development Bank before becoming debt negotiator.
Aged 50, Mr Malan also appears to have unusually long staying power by
Brazilian standards. He has held his position as debt negotiator for three
years despite numerous changes at the helm of the Finance Ministry.
Assuming the mantle of Central Bank governor is an unenviable task, with
inflation for this year nearing a record 2,000 per cent. Mr Malan has
already turned down the job on two previous occasions. But he was persuaded
by Mr Cardoso, with whom he enjoys close working relations.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Canada hails victory on Nafta talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Progressive Conservative government is congratulating itself on a
big political victory in persuading the US to give Canada special treatment
under the new environmental and labour side-accords to the North American
free trade agreement.
With prime minister Kim Campbell expected to call a general election within
the next few weeks, the deals have given her another opportunity to distance
herself from the unpopular, pro-Washington record of her predecessor, Mr
Brian Mulroney.
Under a last-minute compromise, Canada won the right to refer environmental
and labour disputes to its domestic courts as a last resort, rather than
face a suspension of Nafta trade benefits.
At the end of last week, Mr Tom Hockin, Canada's trade minister, said: 'I
could not tolerate that option for Canada because we negotiated Nafta to
knock down trade barriers.'
As a result of a compromise reached at close to midnight on Thursday, any
dispute involving a Canadian company will be referred in the last resort to
the Canadian courts.
Mr Hockin said all three governments envisaged that trade sanctions and
referral of disputes to the courts 'will hardly ever happen'.
Canadian trade officials however, have played down the importance of the
dispute-settlement mechanism in the side-deals. They said the strength of
the deals lay more in the machinery for co-operation and consultation than
in their punitive measures.
The dispute settlement mechanism can be invoked only in cases where it
appears that one of the three governments is consistently failing to enforce
the labour or environmental standards set down in domestic law.
Although companies and individuals will be able to submit complaints, only
the three governments will be able to invoke the complex dispute settlement
mechanism.
Action against individual polluters falls outside the scope of the
side-agreements and remains the responsibility of the host government.
The Canadian parliament has already passed legislation implementing Nafta.
It will not be proclaimed law however, until the agreement has been ratified
by the US and Mexico.
The side-deals will require only a minor amendment to an existing law.
However, Canada's provinces, which have jurisdiction over large areas of
labour and environmental policy, will not be bound by the agreements until
they sign on.
The opposition Liberal party said the side-agreements failed to satisfy its
objections to Nafta. A spokesman said a Liberal government would seek to
renegotiate the agreement to give Canada a better deal on such issues as
energy, subsidies and dispute settlement.

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan Congress has approved two oil projects worth a total of
Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 3.2bn), in which international investors will play an
important role.
The two joint ventures involve the production, upgrading and international
placement of heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt, the world's
largest accumulation of heavy oil and bitumen.
In both projects, the Venezuelan partner will be Maraven, a subsidiary of
Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.
Conoco, a unit of EI du Pont de Nemours, will hold 49.9 per cent equity in
one project that calls for total expenditures of Dollars 1.7bn. The
promoters plan to produce 120,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil and use
a delayed coking process to make lighter crude that can be processed by a
Conoco refinery in the US. Maraven will also have 49.9 per cent equity.
In the other project, which has a projected cost of Dollars 3.1bn, the
international partners will be France's Total and two Japanese companies,
Itochu and Marubeni.
At present, Total is expected to have 40 per cent of equity, Maraven 35 per
cent and two Japanese partners 25 per cent. Maraven said the equity
composition of the projects could change if new international partners were
added.
On August 10, the Congress opened the door to foreign investment in
Venezuela's oil and gas industries for the first time since the 1976
nationalisation.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Counting the cost of trade impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS worldwide are paying billions of dollars in higher prices for many
goods and services because of governments' failure to conclude the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says
in a report published today.
The report marks another step in the campaign by Gatt's new
director-general, Mr Peter Sutherland, to convince political leaders and a
wider public of the benefits of a swift conclusion to the long-delayed
negotiations. The round, launched in 1986, is now due to end in
mid-December, three years behind schedule.
Commenting on the report, which draws together the results of independent
research, Mr Sutherland said virtually all protection meant higher prices.
'It is high time that governments made clear to consumers just how much they
pay - in the shops and as taxpayers - for decisions to protect domestic
industries from import competition.'
Gatt notes that European Community consumers each paid an average of Dollars
450 (Pounds 302) last year in higher prices and taxes to support EC farmers,
according to the OECD. For the US, the cost was Dollars 360 per head, and
for Japan Dollars 600.
For clothing, Gatt estimates based on earlier studies suggest that
protection may now be costing a family of four up to Dollars 420 a year in
the US, Dollars 220 a year in Canada and Dollars 130 a year in Britain.
High trade barriers imposed by the EC on imports of electronic goods cost
consumers almost Dollars 1.3bn a year, according to Britain's National
Consumer Council.
Yet trade protection, which hits poor households hardest, cannot be
justified as an effective way of saving threatened jobs, Gatt argues.
The Uruguay Round, if successful, will cut tariffs by at least a third,
eliminate quotas and many other restraints on trade, reduce farm subsidies
and strengthen Gatt's fair trade rules.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Britain to reappraise evacuations: Airlift of wounded from
Bosnian capital stepped up as 39 adults and children leave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-NINE sick or injured adults and children were flown from Sarajevo,
the Bosnian capital, yesterday for treatment in Britain and Sweden. A
further five are expected to be flown out by the Irish government in the
next few days.
Amid claims that the operation had become an emotive publicity stunt, with
insufficient co-ordination among the different aid groups, the British
government yesterday said that it would be 'reassessing' the situation
before it pressed ahead with an offer to send another aircraft to evacuate
civilians.
Officials with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the former
Yugoslavia admitted the recent publicity over the evacuations had left them
with more offers of hospital beds than they had patients for.
Nearly 300 beds had been offered for injured Bosnians by European and Moslem
governments, as well as private American groups, although UNHCR officials
had only been wanting to evacuate some 25 victims a week from Sarajevo, it
said.
UN officials stressed more aid was needed across the region, and reiterated
that with funding for its Bosnian operations due to run out in October, the
UNHCR needed more money.
Following the Serb withdrawal from mountains around Sarajevo this weekend
and plans for resumed peace talks in Geneva today, the situation around
Sarajevo was fairly quiet, a spokesman for the UN protection force yesterday
said.
However, fighting was continuing yesterday between Moslem and Croatian
forces in central Bosnia. This was preventing aid convoys from reaching
those regions, he added.
'Things are opening up around Sarajevo. But in central Bosnia things are
still very difficult, although this hasn't had the headlines,' the spokesman
said.
As the diplomatic wrangling over the humanitarian efforts continued, the
British government sought to play down allegations that there was too great
a focus on child victims from Sarajevo, following the emotional press
coverage of Irma Hadzimuratovic, a five-year-old victim of mortar shrapnel
who was evacuated by the British government last week. The 21 patients
evacuated to Britain yesterday would be treated at nine NHS hospitals, with
the cost of the air ambulance being met by the Saudi Arabian royal family,
it added.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Croats threatened to walk out of today's peace talks and
stop aid convoys into central Bosnia unless the international community gave
treatment to their sick and wounded comparable to that received by the
Moslems.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Mitterrand hits out at speculators
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francois Mitterrand, French president, has denounced speculators for
triggering the recent currency crisis and called for a speeding up of the
single European currency, Reuter reports from Paris.
In an interview with the French daily newspaper Sud-Ouest released
yesterday, he called speculation a challenge to democracy. 'I find it insane
and immoral that speculation, using billions of dollars, can have its way
against states representing their people's interests and upset the daily
life of millions of people.'
Mr Mitterrand said speculators had targeted the European monetary system
rather than the franc and the system should be strengthened.
He said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's recent suggestion that the EC might
not achieve a single currency by the 1999 target date should be seen as a
statement of difficulties lying ahead rather than a sign of fading
enthusiasm for monetary unity.

<TEXT>
ANY WESTERN hopes that international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg can broker a quick settlement to the bloodshed in the former
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina are unlikely to be fulfilled, with
the future of Sarajevo and the precise boundaries of future mini-states
still strongly disputed.
When Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic returns to the peace talks today,
he will face Serb and Croat adversaries who are only willing to negotiate on
the basis of their military gains during the 17-month war.
However, Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, reiterated at the weekend that he would
only endorse a settlement which gave his Bosnian republic about 40 per cent
of the territory of the proposed 'union' of three ethnic republics. The new
Bosnia, he said, would have to encompass land currently held by Serb forces,
which until the outbreak of war was mostly Moslem.
Amid seemingly irreconcilable differences, the parties will today sit down
to discuss the maps. Talks on future borders were stalled for two weeks
while Serb political and military leaders played cat and mouse with the
international community over their pledge to hand over the strategic Mount
Igman, captured during the talks.
At the weekend Serb forces finally withdrew from Mount Igman, which
overlooks Sarajevo, but Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, believes
his military superiority will dictate the terms of a peace agreement.
Mr Izetbegovic envisages that most of eastern Bosnia, which shares a
frontier with Serbia and was Moslem before the war, will be part of the
future Bosnian republic.
Mr Karadzic says 'this is out of the question'. He claims almost all of
eastern Bosnia, under Serb control except for three remaining Moslem
pockets, proclaimed UN 'safe areas'. Serbs need the frontier territory in
order to form a Greater Serbia.
Mr Izetbegovic insists that his Bosnian republic must have access to the
northern River Sava and to ports on the Adriatic Sea. Lord Owen has backed
this demand.
However, Mr John Zametica, Bosnian Serb spokesman, says it would be
'impossible for Moslem territory to have a physical outlet on the Sava and
Adriatic'.
Serb leaders also insist on Sarajevo's partition. Lord Owen seems to back
the idea that the self-styled Serb state has a legitimate right to parts of
the city.
Mr Izetbegovic believes this would amount to the death of Bosnia. He will
insist that Serb forces lift their 17-month siege around the capital when
the talks get under way.
'Without fair maps, there is no deal,' Mr Izetbegovic says, stressing he had
accepted ethnic partition when faced with the alternative of more war.
But he lacks power to break the Serb stranglehold. The size and viability of
his future state depends on the will of the international community to
provide the muscle to back a settlement.
Pledges from foreign powers face a crucial test. Mr Karadzic has repeatedly
threatened that if Mr Izetbegovic rejects his offer of a land-locked
republic comprising isolated pockets of territory, 'the Moslems will be left
with nothing at all'.
Bosnian Serb leaders privately boast they will make life so unpleasant in
any union that the Moslems would soon seek its dissolution. The mediators
must realise the survival of the Bosnian republic cannot depend solely on
the goodwill of hostile Serb and Croat neighbours, but will need
international enforcement.

FT  16 AUG 93 / VW workers put their trust in Lopez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING is concrete in Wolfsburg: the town hall, the post office, the
shops, the tidy apartment blocks.
The uniformity confirms that the visitor is in a company town. For Wolfsburg
has been dominated by Volkswagen, Germany's second largest industrial group,
since the foundation stone was laid in May 1938 for its car factory.
'Wolfsburg is Volkswagen,' said Ms Christine Noack, a town hall official.
'Every family has some member working at the plant. Our past and future is
linked to Volkswagen.'
The local swimming pool is named after Mr Ferdinand Porsche, who engineered
the original 'people's car', the beetle. Volkswagen has built the athletics
track and has helped build and finance the town's housing for 129,000
inhabitants.
But for the first time since the second world war, the locals talk about
unemployment. 'We keep hearing about how uncompetitive we are, that we have
to cut costs,' said one worker.
The problem is that the executive brought in to cut those costs, Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, is under investigation for allegedly acquiring
confidential documents from General Motors, his previous employer.
Mr Ralph Sieber is an outgoing, single, 28 year-old, who has spent 12 years
working for VW. But he is worried about the future. 'I hear that Lopez can
make VW great again,' he said. Mr Sieber admitted he had no idea whether the
allegations against Mr Lopez were true. 'I don't know what to believe. This
public dispute is not good for our image.'
A similar concern about VW's tarnished image, and a faith in Mr Lopez's
talents, is shared by workers coming off the morning shift. 'I'm confused
about the whole scandal. I want Lopez to put things right. Its the first
time I have questioned my security. We have to offer our children some
hope,' said Mr Harold Pfeiffer, a 51-year-old technician.
However, VW's public relations personnel are keen to project the culture of
abiding corporate loyalty. 'The board has thrown its support behind Lopez.
Everybody is innocent until proven otherwise,' said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs,
VW's executive director of public relations.
'Of course, none of this is good for our domestic or international image.
Some of our critics say we have over-reacted in our response to these
allegations about industrial espionage. But that is not the issue,' he says.
'This row is not so much a confrontation between VW and General Motors/Opel.
It is about the personality of Mr Lopez. GM is hurt because Lopez left.
Lopez made General Motors and Opel much more competitive. GM knows that
Lopez can make VW leaner and more competitive. Piech (VW's chairman) and
Lopez make a great team,' says Mr Wachs.
'And after two, three, or four years with Lopez, VW will be much more
competitive. So the other side has only one choice: discredit Lopez. In that
sense, it is an industrial confrontation between two main competitors.'
Indeed, Mr Wachs and his colleagues asked whether GM might itself have
planted the documents.
'We wonder about it. Look, Lopez and VW have no need of these documents,'
said Mr Wachs. 'But if he is forced out, the chance to create the 'third
industrial revolution' will have been lost, and with it the chance to help
the industry get more competitive. I hope he will pull through.'

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Charles Pasqua, France's hard-line interior minister, yesterday
criticised the constitutional council for its decision to block some of his
proposals to curb illegal immigration.
The council, which vets all legislation passed by the French parliament to
ensure it conforms with the constitution, on Saturday vetoed eight of the 52
measures proposed by Mr Pasqua on the grounds that foreigners would be
denied the basic rights available to anyone on French soil.
The rejected measures include banning foreign students from bringing their
families to France and allowing local mayors to try to postpone, or forbid,
suspected marriages of convenience between foreigners and French citizens.
The council also opposed Mr Pasqua's controversial proposal to extend the
detention periods of foreigners who can not be deported because they have no
identity papers.
Mr Pasqua, renowned in France for his draconian views and forthright manner,
said the council's decision was 'politically motivated' and that 'it does
not correspond to the wishes of the majority'.
However, he said he would comply with its request to revise the vetoed
measures and would present new proposals to parliament when it reconvened in
autumn.
Immigration has emerged as one of the most controversial domestic issues in
France since the centre-right Balladur government took power in March. There
are now about 4m foreigners living legally in the country and up to 1m
illegal immigrants. Economic recession and the influx of emigres from
eastern Europe has heightened concern.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Bank of France's autonomy delayed: Independence Awaits
Treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW making the Bank of France independent of the French government must
be postponed until after implementation of the Maastricht treaty on European
union, according to a ruling by the French constitutional council.
The ruling, which should delay the legislation until after a European
Community summit in late October, comes at a sensitive time.
The French central bank is not only burdened by a deficit on its foreign
exchange holdings following its unsuccessful efforts to defend the franc,
but is poised for a change of governor.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the present governor, is expected this week to be
appointed president of the Bank of European Reconstruction and Development
in London and to be replaced at the Bank of France by Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, a highly respected financier who is now director of the Treasury.
He was previously an aide to Mr Edouard Balladur, now the French prime
minister.
The independence of the Bank of France, required under the terms of the
Maastricht treaty, has been one of the main legislative projects undertaken
by the French centre-right government since it took office this spring. The
legislation was passed by parliament earlier this summer but requires the
constitutional council's approval before implementation.
The council's ruling means any move will have to wait until Germany has
ratified the Maastricht treaty. The German parliament has already done so
and the treaty is now awaiting approval by the German constitutional
council, which is expected to announce its decision by early October.
A European Community summit, which will finally endorse the treaty, is
scheduled for the end of that month.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Rexrodt in bid to free shop opening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S highly restrictive laws on shop opening hours look set to become a
new political battleground, in the campaign to liberalise the German economy
and make it more internationally competitive.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister and leading member of the liberal
Free Democrats, promised yesterday to try to scrap the laws, or radically
liberalise them, after the elections next year.
The move would be fiercely resisted both by German trade unions and by
traditionalists in the churches, but would be welcomed by consumers and
working couples.
The present law requires all shops to close by 18.30 on weekdays, and 14.00
on Saturdays, with a ban on all evening and Sunday trading. They are allowed
to open late on Thursdays, until 20.00, and on every first Saturday in the
month. The only exceptions are at garages and railway stations, where a
growing variety of goods is now being traded throughout the day.
No moves are possible before the 1994 elections, because the sensitive
subject of shop opening hours was not included in the agreement negotiated
by the coalition parties - including Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats, and the conservative Christian Social Union from Bavaria - for
the current parliament.
Mr Kohl showed his own caution last night, in spite of his commitment to
more liberalisation, when he spoke out in a television interview against
Sunday working. He said it was essential to liberalise working hours to
obtain longer machine running times - Germany has the shortest in the
industrialised world - but not at the expense of Sundays.
Mr Rexrodt, however, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the
restrictions on trading hours were a fundamental political error, dating
from the 1950s.
'The time is ripe to scrap the law on trading hours, in the next legislative
period, or at least to liberalise it radically,' he said.
With more time to shop, he said, consumers could promote competition in the
retail trade, with more part-time jobs resulting from flexible hours.

ROMANIA'S railways remained at a near standstill last night as train drivers
continued to defy last Friday's supreme court decision to suspend their
strike for 80 days, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
All but a few of the country's 18,000 train drivers supported union calls to
continue the strike which began last Wednesday, Radio Bucharest said.
The strike, considered the most serious labour conflict since the overthrow
of the Ceausescu regime in 1989, has blocked international rail traffic
through the Balkans and left thousands of Romanian holidaymakers stranded in
train stations around the country. However, the government has made little
attempt to mediate, or provide emergency alternatives, even though many
Romanians depend on public transport.
Instead, the government has stressed the illegality of the conflict and
called on the country to oppose the strikers.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Moscow's monetary reform traumatises republics: Russia's
withdrawal of pre-1993 banknotes earlier this year has not had the intended
result among its neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Soviet republics have been scrambling to agree terms with Moscow to
obtain more roubles, suggesting that the Russian central bank's crude
monetary reform may not have achieved its goal of a monetary divorce.
Although the main damage caused in Russia by the withdrawal of pre-1993
banknotes was psychological, the operation was a blow for neighbouring
republics. They had, in recent months, been conducting much of their trade
with Russia with pre-1993 banknotes ahead of western-style credit agreements
to finance energy imports from Russia.
Most important, the operation does not appear to have prompted the republics
either to cement their independence with their own currencies, or to keep
the rouble using budgetary, monetary, and customs policies dictated by
Russia.
When the central bank dropped its rouble bombshell at the end of July, only
the three Baltic republics and Kyrgyzstan had introduced their own
fully-fledged currencies. Ukraine and Georgia, and to a lesser extent
Belarus, had introduced their own surrogate currencies which were everything
but convertible.
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, which have their own energy supplies, promptly
declared they intended to part with the rouble, but the signs are the others
will continue to delay a decision.
To enable salaries to be paid and goods to be purchased domestically,
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Tajikistan have said the old roubles
will remain legal tender at home. But to avoid a breakdown in trade and to
obtain some new 'real money', they have been conducting feverish
negotiations with Russia to secure new banknotes, before finalising
conditions for using the rouble as their own currency.
Cynics say there is nothing to stop republics such as Uzbekistan, which has
already received Rbs50bn in new banknotes, from taking the new notes as a
free gift from Russia and then introducing their own currency.
Meanwhile, explanations of what the policy was meant to achieve, and what is
being negotiated with the republics, remain confused.
Mr Alexander Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the central bank, said on Friday
Russia wanted to create a monetary and economic union whereby other
republics would have their own currencies but conduct trade with the Russian
rouble. In the meantime, he said, Russia had to 'help' republics like
Kazakhstan, which were not yet ready to introduce their own currency.
Such help could involve printing their own currency for them, and might
involve giving them shipments of new rouble banknotes.
Given the problems generated for the republics by Russia's sudden change of
policy in July, they should be keen to introduce their own currencies. But,
while a national currency is a true sign of independence and gives a
republic the tools to pursue an independent economic reform policy, it is
fraught with risks.
The arguments against a national currency include painful macro-economic
policies needed to support a sound currency, which Estonia has achieved, but
Ukraine, for instance, has not. Another powerful incentive for sticking with
the rouble could be that those republics introducing their own currency will
have to pay world prices for energy supplies from Russia.
The confusion in Belarus, where the central bank has been considering its
own currency while the government has been looking at monetary union with
Russia, reflects the difficult choices facing a republic heavily dependent
on Russian energy to run its industry.
Delegations from Armenia and Belarus were in Moscow last week for talks. Mr
Vladimir Manoyan, a government spokesman for Armenia, pleaded an absence of
reserves (the country is spending most of its money on supporting the war
with Azerbaijan) and an economic blockade as special reasons for sticking
with the rouble for now.
But while accepting that Armenia, Tajikistan and Moldova - all small states
involved in political and military strife - were special cases which could
keep the rouble, Mr Khandruyev said the aim of talks with Belarus was
different.
Because Belarus had already introduced its own currency when it started
printing coupons to make up for a shortage of rouble banknotes last year, he
said details now needed to be worked out on how, for instance, it would pay
for Russian energy supplies.
On the domestic front, Mr Khandruyev said the objective of forcing
individuals to place more than Rbs100,000 in bank accounts, at interest
rates far lower than inflation, was to make entrepreneurs declare untaxed
revenues. But implementing the policy is proving fraught with difficulties.
Perhaps the only positive outcome of the rouble move is that it has tested
the tender shoots of a growing civil society, with the Russian Association
of Banks asking the constitutional court to examine whether the move
violated property rights.

<TEXT>
NEW regulations are to go into effect today fixing the exchange rate of the
Ukrainian currency to the dollar for some trade-related dealings, writes
Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Ukrainian enterprises, which are obliged to sell
50 per cent of their hard-currency earnings to the government, will be
reimbursed at the fixed rate of 5,970 coupons to the dollar.
The change is part of the government's attempt to obtain enough hard
currency to offset the country's growing balance-of- payments crisis,
triggered by Russia's shift to charging world prices for its oil exports to
other former Soviet states.
However, top government reformers criticised the move as a throwback to the
days of central planning and said it would encourage capital flight from
Ukraine.
Under the old rules, enterprises were compensated for the hard currency they
were obliged to sell to the government at a floating exchange rate
determined by twice-weekly hard currency auctions held at the central bank.
The new regulations allow enterprises to trade dollars above the 50 per cent
surrender requirement at floating rates.
They also allow Ukrainian citizens to buy or sell foreign currency in
unrestricted quantities at the floating rate.

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN has withdrawn from the war of words over industrial espionage
with car market rival Adam Opel, owned by General Motors, amid fresh media
charges contradicting VW's claims that no Opel data ever came into its
possession.
The troubled German group, which last Friday commissioned auditors KPMG
Deutsche Treuhand to carry out an independent internal investigation, said
it wanted to return to its main job: making and selling cars.
'We have done everything possible. We have carried out our own investigation
and now set up an independent examination,' said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs,
VW's executive director of public relations. 'We are no longer prepared to
discuss the matter and every new charge in public.'
VW's decision to remain silent coincided with detailed claims in Der
Spiegel, the weekly magazine, that 11 Volkswagen trainees had worked for
several days at the end of March typing Opel data into computers in a VW
property once used to house 'guest workers' from Italy.
The magazine also printed alleged excerpts from an affidavit by Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW production director, and focus of theft,
espionage and fraud investigations.
'Neither before my leaving, in connection with my leaving GM, nor afterwards
did I give secret GM/Opel information or data to Volkswagen,' the extracts
said. 'In particular I neither inserted nor asked for any secret data to be
inserted in VW computers . . .'
The reported contents of the affidavit suggested a further shift from his
earlier position that he and his colleagues - three of whom are also under
investigation - took no secrets from GM and Opel, the US group's German
subsidiary, when they left in March.
All VW's recent public relations efforts have been focused on dispelling the
suspicion - potentially more damaging to the group than the loss of its
production director or his helpers - that it has been involved in spying.
On August 6, the VW supervisory board said an internal investigation had
found nothing to warrant charges of industrial espionage.
That statement was accompanied by an admission that 'possibly' secret
documents had been destroyed in Wolfsburg at Mr Lopez's suggestion along
with personal effects from his former Opel office, and a declaration of
'unaltered trust' in him. Mr Wachs could not comment on reports that Mr
Klaus Liesen, chairman of the company's supervisory board, was to work
full-time with the executive management to help it through the current
crisis.
But he confirmed that non-executive supervisors were working closely with
management.

FT  16 AUG 93 / US lawyer acquitted on BCCI fraud charges: Justice
Department to consider reviving federal case against Altman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US JUSTICE Department investigators will meet this week to consider reviving
charges of bank fraud over the BCCI affair after the collapse of the case
against Washington lawyer Mr Robert Altman.
He was acquitted on Saturday in a New York state court of charges that he
helped the now-collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International to gain
secret control illegally of a US bank.
The federal charges against Mr Altman and his colleague, Mr Clark Clifford,
the 86-year-old former US defence secretary who did not stand trial in New
York because of ill health, were dismissed earlier this year at the request
of the Justice Department, which did not want its case to interfere with the
state prosecution.
Legal experts, however, believe that the failure of New York prosectors to
convict Mr Altman on eight fraud and bribery charges would make it difficult
for the federal government to revive its own charges, which were similar to
those brought in the New York case.
The acquittal on Saturday was a serious blow to Mr Robert Morgenthau, the
New York district attorney who has spent three years investigating the
complex web of BCCI's activities in the US and abroad. He has won three
convictions related to the banking scandal with hundreds of millions of
dollars of fines levied. But the Altman case was the centrepiece of his
investigations.
In the US, the leadership on investigating BCCI came from Mr Morgenthau,
partly because the Bush administration's Justice Department had been slow in
pursuing the case.
On Saturday, Mr Morgenthau said that in spite of the verdict his office's
investigation of BCCI would continue.
The case had begun to go Mr Altman's way last month, when the trial judge
dismissed four of the eight criminal charges against him because of a lack
of evidence. After the jury delivered its verdict Mr Altman said the case
should never have been tried: 'The government put on a five-month trial, and
we put on a five-minute defence. There was absolutely no merit to this.'
Mr Altman, who still faces civil actions relating to the BCCI scandal,
insisted that neither he nor Mr Clifford knew that BCCI had secretly gained
control of the Washington-based banking group First American. Mr Altman and
Mr Clifford were both senior officers of First American.
Jurors said after the trial ended that the prosecution had not presented
enough evidence to convince them of Mr Altman's guilt. They also said the
defence had undermined the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
Defence lawyers argued in their closing statements that Mr Altman was being
used as a scapegoat by banking regulators to cover up their own failure to
uncover BCCI's illegal ownership of First American.
At the time that federal charges were dismissed, government officials
reserved the right to file the same, or even tougher, charges against the
two lawyers if the state trial did not lead to a 'successful conclusion'.
Yesterday, a Justice Department spokeswoman said Ms Janet Reno, the attorney
general, would make the final decision.
A number of key BCCI figures who have been indicted in the US, including Mr
Swaleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, are in Abu Dhabi or
elsewhere, beyond the reach of US prosecutors.

FT  16 AUG 93 / World Bank scales down proposals to become more open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK has scaled back plans to increase disclosure of information
and to set up an appeals panel to review complaints.
The move has drawn criticism from non-governmental groups that have been
lobbying for greater transparency in the institution's operations.
Executive directors representing the World Bank's member countries discussed
draft policy papers on the disclosure of its studies and reports, and the
establishment of an inspection panel to review complaints about Bank-funded
projects last month.
But revised drafts scale down the degree of disclosure, and also aim for a
more modest inspection panel than once proposed.
In a memorandum attached to the disclosure draft, Mr Ernest Stern, the World
Bank veteran who is running the institution while Mr Lewis Preston, the
president, recovers from surgery, says the proposals are based on the
judgment 'that the bank should be more open about its policies and
activities and that broader dissemination of information will enhance the
quality of our work and strengthen public understanding of it'.
However, the new draft has eliminated all references to a reform which would
have led to the bank obtaining blanket approval from borrower countries for
the disclosure of documents relating to them.
Executive directors at last month's board meeting insisted on the need for
some confidentiality in order to ensure frank discussion with borrowers and
among directors.
Mr Stern says in his memorandum that the proposed disclosure procedures will
'maintain the presumption of disclosure while providing the governments
concerned an opportunity to review appraisal, country economic and sector
reports and identify specific issues of confidentiality'.
Blanket clearance has been a core demand for advocates of greater
transparency, including both environmentalists and campaigners for democracy
in areas such as Africa, where governments rarely disclose much information
to their citizens.
While environmentalists criticised the case by case disclosure policy, the
new policy would, nevertheless, expand the categories of document made
public by the World Bank.
Staff appraisal reports on individual projects, reviews of the overall
economy or of specific sectors in member countries, and summaries of audits
by the operations evaluation department would be made available.
However, a new 'project information document', intended to give advance
information on projects being considered for bank financing, is viewed by
environmentalist groups as inadequate.
Environmentalist groups are particularly critical of a proposal that the
panel's findings should only be made public after the bank board had decided
on them - too late for the plaintiff to have much influence on the decision.
However, it seems likely that executive directors will agree to the
disclosure policy at a board meeting on August 26.

FT  16 AUG 93 / Electricity price cuts likely for large companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of Britain's largest companies should see reductions in record high
electricity costs this autumn after a decision by the power industry to
change the way prices are calculated.
The changes are likely to lead to falls in prices of the electricity
wholesale 'pool', where power in England and Wales is traded, of between at
least 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent.
The move could save some companies several millions of pounds annually.
Imperial Chemical Industries' annual bill, for example, is more than Pounds
140m.
There has been strong criticism and intense scrutiny of the industry after a
20 per cent rise in pool prices since April.
The government and Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, have
been under pressure from large companies to act on prices or persuade
electricity companies to do so.
Further reforms being examined by the pool's executive, made up mainly of
electricity company managers, could also lead to reductions.
Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, said the changes were the first
to come out of a long-term review and were a step in the right direction.
However, they are unlikely to satisfy intensive energy users who have
suffered significant price rises since electricity privatisation three years
ago.
In the first of two reforms agreed last week, the pool is to introduce a
system, called demand side bidding, through which large customers can agree
to reduce consumption if the price goes above a certain level.
This is expected by the pool to lead to a 3 per cent cut in pool prices at
times of peak demand and 1.5 per cent on average.
A software system, called goalpost, blamed for sudden fluctuations in the
pool price, will be abolished immediately. Price 'spikes', or surges, are
particularly prominent early in the morning, causing difficulties for
industries which work through the night. Goalpost's abolition has already
had an effect. Weekend pool prices, the first since the change was agreed,
were considerably less variable than they had been recently.
Abolition will have an effect on overall prices, although the pool is unable
to say how much.
Most electricity consumers, including householders, will be affected by the
changes only at the margins. Their power is traded through the pool, but
they have been shielded from price changes by 'hedging' contracts between
electricity companies. Future contracts will be affected by current pool
prices.
The pool changes have had a direct effect on an estimated 1,500 industrial
customers, including ICI, who buy their power directly from it.
Some were looking for a demand side bidding system which introduced more
significant rewards for participants. The mechanism adopted by the pool will
allow demand bidders to be paid on the same basis as generators which bid
into the pool.
But companies which agree to cut power demands will be given less of a share
in the money created by subsequent pool price cuts than they wanted. Instead
this will be divided between all electricity consumers in the form of price
cuts.
The extent of the cut in pool prices will depend on several factors,
including the attitude of the generators whose bids into the pool are the
most influential factor.
Any change in their bidding behaviour will be watched closely by Prof
Littlechild, who is already reviewing their costs and margins.

The World Bank has given Russia a Dollars 610m (Pounds 420m) loan to develop
oil wells in Siberia, the largest loan for a single project in the bank's
48-year history, officials said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow. The
agreement, signed in Moscow, is aimed at reversing the decline in Russian
oil production. Russia has the world's largest reserves of petroleum and
natural gas, but output has dropped 31 per cent since 1987 because of
antiquated equipment, poor planning, labor problems and leaky pipelines. The
loan is earmarked for restoration of 1,300 wells and replacement of more
than 1,000km of pipeline.

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNOR of Brazil's Central Bank resigned last night after being placed
in an untenable position by President Itamar Franco.
Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes' job as governor had been in doubt all week since he
received a public scolding from Mr Franco over confusion surrounding the new
currency introduced at the start of this month.
The row centred on predated cheques, which are a common form of obtaining
consumer credit in Brazil's inflationary economy. The Central Bank contested
Mr Franco's announcement that predated cheques written in the old currency
would be accepted up until November, declaring the decision illegal.
Alleging subversion, Mr Franco issued an official note making it obvious he
wanted Mr Ximenes to quit.
The battle over the cheques was just the latest in a series of clashes
between Mr Franco and Mr Ximenes. The two men have had frequent conflicts
over interest rates, Mr Franco blaming the governor for the high rates which
Mr Ximenes claims are essential with inflation nearing 33 per cent a month.
In office since September, Mr Ximenes was the longest surviving member of Mr
Franco's economics team. Since he took office there have been five finance
ministers. His departure will heighten the country's economic instability
and comes as a blow to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the latest finance
minister, who had been anxious that he continued.
Although Mr Cardoso said last night monetary policy would not change, Mr
Franco is expected to appoint someone to the post who agrees with his wish
to keep lower interest rates. Mr Cardoso said Mr Ximenes' resignation was
over 'a question of overall economic policy'.

<TEXT>
Estonia's National Court has annulled the result of last month's referendum
in Narva, a Russified city which voted overwhelmingly for regional autonomy,
reports Matthew Kaminski in Vilnius.
The unanimous decision marks the latest act in the conflict between
Estonia's government and its Russian minority, around 40 per cent of 1.6m
population, over language and citizenship rights.
Moscow, keeping a close eye on the 25m Russian diaspora scattered across the
former Soviet Union, repeatedly denounced Estonia's aliens and election laws
and similar policies in Latvia, where Russians make up 45 per cent of the
population.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Mexican stocks in strong rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S stock market rallied strongly yesterday as news that negotiations
had been successfully concluded to the side agreements on the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The bellwether Telefonos Mexicanos, which accounts for about 30 per cent of
the market's value, leapt by almost 5 per cent, with other communications
and transport stocks leading the way.
In Washington, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, talked of a
'historic agreement', which could 'reform a trade relationship with Mexico
that has been driven more by accident than design'.
Only brief details of the agreement were outlined in an early statement by
Mr Jaime Serre Puche, Mexico's trade minister. President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari was expected to talk at greater length in a speech planned for later
in the day.
According to President Clinton, speaking at a naval supply station in
Oakland California, a pledge by President Salinas to make minimum wage
standards part of Nafta had paved the way for an overnight breakthrough.
It was clear Mexico had in late stages of negotiation bent over backwards to
accommodate US demands that the side agreements should have 'teeth'. Mexico
will be liable for trade sanctions in the event that its companies fail to
comply with national labour and environmental laws.
Negotiators emphasised that the side agreements would not require Mexico to
strengthen existing labour and environment laws - at least not immediately.
Instead, sanctions would be triggered if Mexico fails to enforce existing
laws.
The US and Mexico have agreed to create a commission to finance
environmental and infrastructure improvements along their 2,000-mile border,
but early statements left it unclear how these improvements will be funded.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Libya threatened with tougher sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA was threatened last night with tougher sanctions unless it hands over
the suspects in the Lockerbie airliner bombing by October 1, Agencies report
from New York.
The ultimatum was given by the US, Britain and France after the United
Nations Security Council renewed the existing sanctions against Libya.
The present sanctions, introduced 16 months ago, prevent the sale of arms to
Libya, ban aviation links, and call for a scaling down of diplomatic links.
The tough new sanctions would hit Libya in oil-related, financial and
technological fields, but it was not clear how significant they would be.
The UN imposed sanctions against Libya because of its refusal to hand over
the Lockerbie suspects for trial in the US or Britain. The two men are
suspected of planting a bomb which blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie
in Scotland in December 1988, killing all 259 people aboard as well as 11 on
the ground.
The existing sanctions have been extended by the UN five times, and pressure
for tougher measures has grown as the dispute has dragged on.
But there has been periodic speculation that Libya may be trying to reach
some arrangement with western nations to end the row and to avert further
sanctions.
Diplomats at the UN said that the US wanted to give Libya no more than 30
days to comply with the latest ultimatum, but agreed to allow a little more
time under French and British pressure. The proposed future sanctions might
encompass a ban on all Libyan oil sales, as well as a freeze on Libyan
financial assets, they said.
However, European nations that import Libyan oil, such as Italy, have been
opposed to expanding the sanctions to include an oil embargo.

<TEXT>
GOOD OLD Country Life. Some people are rude about it, you know. They say it
is antediluvian, mimsy mamsy, camp and affected - cynical in its defence of
a way of life and a set of values that should have died out in the Middle
Ages.
At the Notting Hill dinner parties I usually go to - we eat everything with
our fingers and have zillions of tons of cred - there is nothing like
Country Life for generating laughter. You only have to mention it and the
hands on the clapometer whirl giddily round and round.
'Did you know', someone will say, quoting a recent article, 'that a set of
Windsor chairs at Beaulieu, emblazoned with the arms of the second Duke of
Montagu, may be the earliest Gothic-Revival chairs in existence?'
Or: 'According to Country Life, the science of breeding English foxhounds
was revolutionised in the first half of this century - the aim being to
lighten their conformation and improve hunting ability by use of the Welsh
outcrop.'
Or: 'The arrival of warm, sun-burnished corn cobs in the kitchen is a
reminder that the year is growing old. Snatched piping hot from the pan,
corn-on-the-cob needs no other accompaniments than a supply of melted
butter, a dish of fine sea salt, a fully charged pepper mill and a large,
absorbent napkin.'
Or: 'It's a terribly good summer for voles . . . '
I never join the laughter. For my money, Country Life does a stalwart job in
defending traditional values. It is a bulwark against the knockers, positive
vs negative, a winking blip of sanity in a crazy, warring world wracked by
pre-millennial tension.
I especially enjoyed its editorial comment in the August 5 issue, applauding
the news that porters have been reinstated at London's King's Cross rail
station just in time for the grouse season, 'when sportsmen and women will
begin the traditional struggle towards sleeper compartments, slung about
with guncases, fishing rods and well-seasoned luggage. Now they need only
part with a couple of pounds to find their impedimenta - up to five pieces -
carried for them.'
Well spoken, Country Life. But it did not rest on its laurels. Instead, it
broadened its argument by calling for changes to the employment laws so that
it would be easier to find servants to work in the countryside. It wants the
cost of employing domestic staff to be allowable against tax. 'The notion
that only the small number of (house) owners lucky enough to employ butlers
would gain from it is absurd', said the magazine. 'The majority of domestic
staff in the countryside consist of daily cleaners, gardeners and grooms who
work in and round houses that are by no means ducal.'
I agree with this entirely. I have a PA and a cleaner; otherwise I am
bereft. I choose my own clothes in the morning and drive myself to work
where I have to operate the lift (elevator, to Americans) to reach my
third-floor office. I do my own telephoning and all my own typing and
actually write this column. Yes, I write this column personally. No one
lends a hand. You would think I would write the intro and then someone would
take over.
At lunch in the corporate restaurant I choose all my own food and stagger
around with a tray. Then I do more telephoning and perhaps a bit more typing
and probably attend a meeting - I have to attend in person - and then I
drive home again through nasty beasty traffic where I cook my own dinner and
choose a bedtime book which I have to read out loud to myself because there
is no one to read it for me.
All of which is outrageous. I am not the sort of person who was put on this
planet to choose his own clothes, drive himself to work, operate lifts
(elevators, to Americans), do his own telephoning, actually write a column,
serve himself in restaurants, personally attend meetings, cook his own
dinner, read his own book or wrestle with any of the humiliating tasks and
challenges which beset modern life.
I am the sort of person who should live in a moated manor house with
servants to dress him, drive him, feed him, read to him and tell him whether
this is a good summer for voles or an absolutely brilliant one.
Dear old Country Life. Its campaign for tax deductible servants is steeped
in rightness. The next time people laugh at it at a Notting Hill dinner
party I shall bang my corn cob on the table and make my opinion known.

FT  14 AUG 93 / As They Say in Europe: English like it should be spoke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I READ the other day that Liz Forgan, the boss of BBC radio, was worrying
about accents. She has commissioned research into what the London Evening
Standard called the 'tyranny of the well-spoken south over national
broadcasting.' She said: 'I think sometimes we sound a little monotonous . .
. like a narrow slug of the population.'
I am as prejudiced as any narrow slug and, therefore, glad to take advantage
of the new freedom of debate within the BBC. But all I have to contribute is
to wonder why our concern to give regional accents a fair hearing is not
shared elsewhere.
In countries as different as France and Poland, you go to a special school
to make sure you speak proper before broadcasting. In Germany, if you work
for Bayerische Rundfunk, you might allow a trace of Munich or Upper Bavaria
in your voice, but no more.
In Switzerland, the national news is read in Hochdeutsch, or standard
German, even though no Swiss-German speaks it routinely. The only European
country that allows significant variations in speech is Spain - but for
local broadcasts only. Even in England, surveys have shown that people
prefer the sound of standard English.
The problem goes much deeper, however, than agonising over the precise mix
of regionalism that is necessary.
There was a letter in The Guardian last April from Professor Richard M Hogg
of Manchester University. In it, he contested an assertion by the education
secretary, John Patten, who had said that 'Clive and me went to Wembley' was
incorrect grammatically.
Hogg replied: 'The sentence may not be formally correct but it is
grammatically correct, just as the equally correct 'Clive and I went to
Wembley' would be inappropriate in many informal situations (such as the
school playground).'
This was a savage blow to people like me who had been taught that 'I' was
the subject and 'me' the object, only to be varied in the case of 'It's me.'
(The French similarly say 'C'est moi,' but no professor of French would say
that moi and je are interchangeable).
In England, it is necessary to accept situational grammar. Yet Prof Hogg has
left me with many worries. Is the following sentence correct? - 'Dave and me
was up the Garden last night watchin' Turandot. Gwyneth Jones sung real
good.'
In other countries, any form of incorrectness, let alone yobspeak, is
regarded with derision. Lech Walesa is sneered-at by Warsaw taxi drivers for
his failure to employ the locative case correctly.
The greatest enthusiasm for linguistic purity is found among the people whom
I regard as the best educated in Europe, the Czechs. When I was in Prague
shortly after the fall of communism, among the many graffiti was the
frequent appearance of one word, Mylos - a jibe directed at the last
communist boss, Milos Jakes.
The point is that i and y sound the same in Czech but their use is defined
strictly. Jakes himself spoke bad Czech and this contributed to the contempt
in which he was widely held. The graffito implied that he could not spell
his own name.
Accompanying Prof Hogg's letter in The Guardian was one from Andy Gibbons of
the Campaign for Raising Standards in English, a name that many will find
curiously misleading, for he wrote: 'Expressions such as 'We was . . .' are
a social irritant rather than a barrier to communication.'
I now realise I must drop my hidebound approach to the English language and
accept the doctrine that everything is as good as everything else and
sometimes much better. Nevertheless, I still worry why it is that I find 'me
are' less acceptable than 'us is.'
There remains the problem of what to do about those who put their
officially-sanctioned freedom into practice and end up unemployed rather
than as doctors, investment bankers or barristers.
In countries which have yet to catch up with Britain, the standard spoken
tongue is respected because it provides a standard; it is the language that
a foreigner learns, the tongue in which normal debate can be conducted while
minimising the risk of being misunderstood.
Those who speak the standard tongue are not especially respected. But they
are certainly not derided: they provide a barrier against anarchy.
When I was in Japan recently, I saw a bilingual sign in a shop. The English
version said: 'Children's wear.' That is right. Not 'Childrens wear,' nor
even 'Childrens' wear.' They are so tedious, the Japanese, fussing about
getting things right.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Private View: The whole Globe on his shoulders - Sam
Wanamaker has spent 24 years battling to rebuild Shakespeare's theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK Shakespeare and his fellow shareholders a few months to move their
Globe theatre from Shoreditch to Bankside in 1588. It will have taken Sam
Wanamaker, the American actor-director, more than 25 years to reconstruct it
 -if he gets there at all.
His monomaniac dedication to rebuilding the Globe has been more derided than
applauded. But four sections of a 20-sided timber playhouse have risen from
their concrete plinth by the River Thames, two more will be added in
September, and last month Wanamaker was made an honorary Commander of the
British Empire. Are the doubters themselves beginning to doubt the thing can
never happen?
I found the 74-year-old impresario in his Bear Gardens museum next door,
wrapped against the summer cold, and asked him what made him persist. Any
normal person, I said, would have quit long ago.
'Yes, that's true. I think it's because I'm a stubborn person, that I have
very strong convictions and that I had - and have - a vision of what this
project will be. And it can only be successful. It can only be successful on
all kinds of levels. It will transform the nature of theatre in this country
and in America.'
There are mock Globes all over the world, though none claiming the
architectural authenticity of this one. Wanamaker saw his first Shakespeare
in a Globe in Chicago, where he was born. As a drama student he worked in
another replica at the Great Lakes festival in Cleveland, Ohio.
'So when I came to England in 1949 to find the original Globe and found
nothing except a plaque on a wall, I was bewildered. Here was potential for
touristic exploitation.'
Wanamaker's reconstruction is about 100 yards from the remains of the
original Globe, which lie directly behind the head office of the Financial
Times and next door to Christopher Marlowe's Rose Theatre. The foundations
of both were uncovered recently - a mixed blessing, as it turned out, for
the Bankside pioneer.
Wanamaker will not - cannot - see anything wrong with his idea. Why, then,
has it taken him a quarter of a century to realise it?
The usual answer is that Shakespeare is already in good supply. The National
Theatre is half a mile along the South Bank, the Barbican Theatre, the
London home of the Royal Shakespeare Company, is across the water, and
Stratford-on-Avon amply satisfies the need for a national shrine.
Wanamaker has better explanations. For one thing, he said, the Establishment
has a down on him.
'I am convinced that if somebody like Peter Hall or Ian McKellen or Trevor
Nunn had decided this was a good idea it would have been built years ago,
with government funding. But I was an alien in more ways than one: I was not
only a British alien, I was a London alien and a Southwark alien. The
theatrical establishment has no truck with me whatsoever.'
Why is that?
'You can well ask. I think it's typical British condescension. First of all,
they don't think Americans can do Shakespeare - that it's their British
birthright. I haven't got a great theatrical Shakespearean background: I
don't claim to be an expert Shakespearean. But not one - and I know them all
 -not one of them has given me their voluntary support for this project.'
His voice had risen angrily. 'Not one, in the 24 years that I've been
involved.
'They clearly believe that what I was trying to do was self-aggrandisement.
They also had, I think, that innate suspicion regarding all Americans - that
they are money-grubbing, out to make a fast buck.'
Did you, as a matter of fact, think you might make a lot of money out of it?
'No. I never thought I would make a lot of money out of it. I have been
accused of this over and over again by the local authority. I threatened to
sue one of the Southwark council members who said this in the chamber.'
He continued: 'A lot of my British friends say I'm obsessed by this . . .
what is it? . . . xenophobia, and think I'm exaggerating. That's part of
their demurring that there is no such attitude to Americans. You know very
well there is. It's resentment for the fact that they had to turn to the
Americans for help during the war. They welcomed it, but they resented it.
And they still resent it.'
It was not the Establishment but the newly-elected left-wing Labour council
of Southwark in 1982 which did most to defeat him. Intent on restoring
industry and housing to the south bank, they rescinded the decision of their
moderate predecessors to give Wanamaker a site. It took him three years and
a court action to get his planning permission back.
Wanamaker felt this blow keenly because he had himself been black-listed in
the US as a leftie. He is a British resident because in the early 1950s he
was sub-poenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee while filming
in Britain and decided not to go home.
'I said (to the council): 'I'm on your side, but what you are doing is
destroying a potential for new jobs, housing and industry.' I tried every
way. It didn't matter that I was left-wing, blacklisted. They didn't give a
damn about that. My whole history is creditable in terms of the action and
sacrifices I undertook of time and money and effort to win through on social
causes. I came from the working class. My father was poverty- stricken. As
much as I appealed to my history, they just absolutely turned a blind eye.'
The discoveries of the Rose and Globe remains should have helped Wanamaker
more than they did. According to him, the 'Establishment theatricals' seized
on the 'real' Rose to discredit his 'fake' Globe. Negotiations for joint
fund-raising failed and Wanamaker says he severed relations when Rose
supporters began suggesting that Shakespeare had both acted and been acted
at the Rose. 'There is not one iota of evidence for that.'
His blood pressure rose again when the press reported recently that an
unknown American was negotiating with Lord Hanson, owner of the original
Globe site, to buy the land and put up his own replica.
'The press is extremely naive,' Wanamaker thundered. 'They just pick up this
press release. They don't ask who this man is. Do they call Hanson and say
is he really negotiating, or what? No. They just print the bloody story.' He
was shouting now. 'Then they call me up and say Whaddayou think . . . ?'
You get pretty angry about things, I said. Does it keep you awake at night?
'No, never] I don't get really angry, I get passionate. The difference is
distinct. I flare up from time to time at the stupidity of people and the
short-sightedness of people . . . It doesn't take much imagination to see
the potential of this.'
What about your health? Is this thing driving you to an early grave?
'It's helped to keep me going. It's helped to keep me young and active and
alive and it's involved me with all kinds of circumstances and people I
would never ever have experienced.'
What about the worry?
'No, I'm not a worrier. I sometimes get frustrated with people and
situations but that never affected my health and never did anything but make
me more determined.'
That Wanamaker should still be trying to raise money after so many years
made me wonder whether it was, in the end, his own personality that was the
biggest obstacle to realising his dream.
He reflected. 'Well, I think it is true to say that I have a difficult
personality, that I rub people the wrong way - some people,' he added
quickly, 'some people. It's also true to say that the bulk of the funding
has been raised by me. Now, the only way you can raise money from the
private sector is on a one-to-one basis.
'Therefore I think there is a contradiction there between my personality
possibly being abrasive and the fact that I have the ability to convince
people in a very difficult situation. It's very hard to judge oneself and
one's personality.'
After so many years you must have a pretty good idea.
'Well, I'm tenacious . . .'
Is your abrasiveness due to frustration, impatience . . . ?
'Impatience, probably.'
Because people are stupid, slow-witted?
'No, they're not stupid.'
What is it?
'Well, you know I depended for many years on volunteers. People say they
will do something and then don't do it. And that made me impatient. And of
course I was very bitter, I suppose, with the extreme left in Southwark.'
Do you thing you convey the impression of someone just trying to raise money
for a self-glorifying project?
'No. Anybody who knows me, or spends time with me, cannot believe that I am
superficial, or phoney or dishonest or self-aggrandising. Cannot believe it.
It doesn't take more than a few minutes of discussion with me . . . and I
defy anybody to prove that I have ever gained anything out of this project
other than a marvellous experience of life.'
Wanamaker has spent Pounds 10m so far, needs Pounds 2m to complete the Globe
and Pounds 8m to build the rest of a complex which is to include a second,
indoor theatre, a museum, lecture hall, library, shops and restaurants. He
says the proposed national lottery may help him.
Is this thing definitely going to be built now?
'How can you ask me that question after what I've said? Yes, Yes, Yes] It's
on it's way to being built.'

MARC Isambard Brunel, father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is hardly known
except to those familiar with the annals of civil engineering. And yet Marc,
a refugee from the French Revolution, was easily his son's equal and rather
more successful. His greatest project is commemorated by The Triumphant Bore
a modest but interesting exhibition in the basement of the Institution of
Civil Engineers in Great George Street, London SW1.
The Thames Tunnel, 150 years old this year, was a technological feat which
was the wonder of Europe. Linking Rotherhithe to Limehouse, it was the
Channel Tunnel of its day. Indeed, the Channel Tunnel would be inconceivable
without tunnelling machines which derive ultimately from Brunel's discovery
of the shield method of driving tunnels. The inspiration behind Brunel's
patent of 1818 was the ship-worms he watched boring away at Chatham
Dockyards.
Like the Channel Tunnel, Brunel's tunnel went way over budget and took far
longer than expected, 20 desperately difficult years. It was only achieved
because of Brunel's unswerving dedication. Lives were lost (at one point
very nearly young Isambard's) whenever water poured into the workings. The
Thames was like an open sewer and tunnel sickness caused fatalities or
suddenly sent men blind, sometimes permanently.
Brunel's struggle to build and finance the tunnel makes an inspiring story,
well written up in the catalogue (Pounds 6). In 1837, we find Brunel noting
that the shield was moving across the treacherous riverbed 'at the breadth
of one halfpenny per day.' He himself worked tirelessly beside his miners
amid the stench and constant threat of disaster. Not surprisingly, he
suffered a stroke but Queen Victoria rewarded him with a knighthood.
The exhibition's drawings and plans are for the more technically minded
visitor but I was interested by the tunnel souvenirs. Peeperamas show what
an enjoyable venue the tunnel was at first, with its bright lights and
stalls selling beer, gin and souvenirs. Among the memorabilia are
transformation prints, pottery, engravings, cheroot cases, alabaster peep
eggs, needlecases and the like.
The opening of the Triumphant Bore was an extraordinary success; in one
month it attracted half a million visitors. However, it gradually became the
resort of East End lowlife, public interest waned and The Times started to
call it the Great Bore. Only with the coming of the railways was Brunel's
wonderful achievement at last put to good use.
Channel Tunnel shareholders will note with wry amusement the reason for the
Thames Tunnel's financial failure. 'Funds were never available to meet the
expense of constructing the approaches for carriages and wagons. This
derived the tunnel of much of its original purpose . . .' The Triumphant
Bore runs until the end of August and is sponsored by James Howden &amp;
Company.
August is your last chance to see the Firle Van Dyck currently on loan to
the National Gallery. (The gallery is open until 8pm every Wednesday
evenings through August.) Van Dyck painted this monumental portrait of the
Count of Nassau-Siegen, his wife Ernestina de Ligne and their four teenage
children in Brussels in 1634. The turncoat Dutch nobleman had defected to
the Catholic side and become a great figure at the court of the Spanish
archdukes.
The count dominates the picture, dressed soberly in black like his wife
although Van Dyck's brush brilliantly suggests the sumptuousness of the
fabrics. Their children stand before them, pretty in their bright colours.
The eldest daughter holds a rose, Venus's flower, in one dainty hand. She
wears virginal white and follows her father in looking full face at us, her
audience. Perhaps, then, this portrait is a dynastic statement and the young
lady is demanding our approbation for her filial obedience.
This graceful and important picture is just back from cleaning and
conservation which is the reason for its presence in London. It is the first
project tackled by the newly formed Heritage Conservation Trust. Under the
rules of this charitable trust, grants are made for conserving pre-eminent
works of art in privately owned historic houses.
The works must then be displayed in a public gallery for a period and
thereafter be accessible to the public. For those wishing either to give or
receive, the Trust can be contacted at 071-259-5688. Firle Place itself is
near Lewes in east Sussex and is open through the summer; it sounds
enticing, moreover there is a Connoisseurs Day on the first Wednesday of
each month.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Bold new music in Tuscany - William Weaver roves
through the Italian summer music festivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUSIC-LOVING Tuscan summer residents are lucky, for in almost every part of
the Italian peninsula's largest and, arguably, loveliest region there are
concerts, performances, festivals. The Siena area is particularly blest: in
the city itself the Settimana musicale senese continues its 50th season
mixing scholarship with performances: eminent specialists speak and debate
at conferences during the day, and the subject of their erudition is heard
in the evening.
In Montepulciano, the festival (or 'workshop' as it is understatedly
called), founded almost 20 years ago by Hans Werner Henze, continues to
pursue its eccentric course, seeking a popular consensus with outdoor
performances and accessible prices, while presenting bold programmes of new
or unfamiliar music, plays, dance. And, a bit to the south, under the
dramatic, beetling peak of Monte Amiata, the cellist Antonio Lysy organises
a series of chamber music evenings centering around the family estate, La
Foce.
The Lysy series, known as 'Encounters in the Territory of Siena', concluded
its 1993 festival last week with a typically refined and impressive concert
in the sober courtyard of the Renaissance palace of Pius II Piccolomini, in
the town of Pienza, which the learned Pope designed as the summer residence
of his court.
Lysy's audience - - heard a group of first-rate artists like the pianist
Jeffrey Swann, the violinists Ani Kavafian and James Buswell, the violists
Barbara Westphal and Sophie Renshaw, as well as Lysy and his fellow-cellist
the aristocratic Carter Brey, in various combinations, playing Haydn,
Schumann, and the rare, haunting Reger trio op. 141. In earlier concerts,
the programmes ranged from Haydn's delightful little Concertos for 'lira
organizzata' (a kind of hurdy-gurdy favoured by King Ferdinand of Naples,
who commissioned the pieces) to seldom-performed, youthful chamber works by
Puccini.
In nearby Montepulciano, a few nights later, there was quite a different
feeling. In the course of the 'Workshop,' now under the artistic direction
of the Italian composer Giorgio Battistelli, with the German conductor
Markus Stenz as music director, a number of young artists collect, to
perform but also to listen. So the audience suggests a university or
conservatory atmosphere, a knowledgeable, participant, but not uncritical
public, ideal company for the hearing of new and demanding music.
The most substantial work of the brief season, given in the Teatro
Poliziano, was a 90-minute one-act opera, Leyla und Medjnun, by the
33-year-old Hamburg composer Detlev Glanert, a Henze protege and former
pupil, now also co-director of the Montepulciano municipal music school.
Written in 1987-88 and first performed at the Munich Biennial, Glanert's
work is based on a libretto by Peter Schneider and the Turkish poet Aras
Oren, drawn from the classic Arabic story, best known in the great 12th
century epic retelling by the Persian poet Nizami (an affecting English
version, published in 1966 by Cassirer, also inspired a libretto by Andrew
Porter for the Chinese-American composer Bright Sheng, performed at the
Chicago Opera and in San Francisco).
In Montepulciano, the Glanert opera was given in an Italian version by
Matteo d'Amico and Marco Marica, though the enunciation of the performers
did not always make the words clear. The worst offender was the 'Zenne', or
narrator, a spoken part assumed by the Italian actor Elia Shilton. For that
matter, the very existence of the narrator was a theatrical mistake, dulling
the effect of the drama, which had little of the radiance of the great love
story.
In his small orchestra - about a dozen players - Glanert introduced an
Oriental stringed instrument, the Tar, whose plaintive twang added welcome
colour to the music, a colour that was absent from the stark staging by
Lorenza Cantini, brightened chiefly by some charming puppet animals designed
by Donatella Espositi, but only briefly exploited. As Madjnun, the young
prince driven mad by love, the tenor Lynton Atkinson was correct, cold, far
too sane. His Leyla, Svetla Vassileva, was more appropriately impassioned,
sweet-voiced and tender. Among the other members of the fairly large cast,
Sabina Macculi won attention as a lithe and lyrical gazelle.
Glanert, in this youthful work, demonstrates taste and talent; happily, he
is already at work on a second opera, which will no doubt appear in the
Montepulciano context.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Play with politics - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN SO many BBC plays deal with Irish life, it was right to give Tom
Paulin's All the Way to the Empire Ballroom (Radio 4, Monday), a dramatic
account of how Irish life assumed its present shape. It is October 1921:
Paulin shows Lloyd George and Winston Churchill virtually tricking Arthur
Griffith into signing the partition agreement that has led to the wretched
situation of our own times.
The play examines the problems of persuading Griffith, Michael Collins and
Erskine Childers to consider partition, and of ensuring that the Unionists
would remain loyal enough to keep Lloyd George in Power. But Paulin, being a
poet, has added extra drama. We have a glance at Lloyd George's affair with
his secretary Frances Stevenson. We have the proposal to make Sir John
Lavery (busy painting Collins' portrait) Governor-General of Ireland. There
is a mad moment when Lloyd George, in conference with the Irish delegation,
loses the paper recording Griffith's agreement. The only concession to true
poetry is in Collins's account of the hanging of six of his colleagues.
Director Pam Brighton does not ask her company to represent the historic
sound of the characters' voices. They are just politicians.
Politics of another kind tinged Radio 3's Sunday play, for it was a repeat
of the 1989 broadcast of Plato's Symposium, translated by Tom Griffith and
directed by John Theocharis. No need to recount the content here - you know
it, or you don't. Griffith uses current middle-class language, fluent and
expressive, and the performance is excellently done by fine players, with
Socrates by Leo McKern, as judgmental and amusing as in his more familiar
role, and Paul Shelley as a not-very-drunk Alcibiades. Morally, its view of
love between men seems to be coming back into fashion, except in the US
navy.
File on Four, 4pm on Thursday, dealt with computer crime. It gave several
examples of cases that had been reported, even settled, but no hint of how
computer interference was carried out. This is a problem for pages other
than this. Most computers, we were told, can obtain money in various ways,
'not intellectual'. There is also the problem of the virus, which may not be
used for profit but can destroy calculations. One is the 'Friday the 13th'
virus, any news of which may be out today.
I was disappointed in Radio 3's Changing Times on Tuesday, a view by Max
Easterman of how jazz developed up to 1940. This week was dedicated to 1926,
and this was the year in which (at school) I became seriously interested in
jazz. My key entry was Washboard Blues by Red Nichols and his Five Pennies,
recorded that year. It is a clever, almost neo-Mozartian arrangement for
five star players (the drummer was later in my record of Bartok's Music for
Strings, Percussion and Celesta), who made records that set a fashion among
white players.
Easterman never mentioned Nichols, the leading white trumpet-player before
Beiderbecke, and gave little attention to the small groups, apart from
playing the Memphis Five in Tampico to show how poor it was. He was more
concerned with the effect of the improved electric recording of the bigger
orchestras. Interesting in its way, but less exciting than the small bands,
and less to do with jazz.
This week's Book at Bedtime on Radio 4 was Alice Walker's tale of a black
woman singer who sells her best song to a young white fan. He sings it with
all her mannerisms, but confesses that he does not know what it is about.
Still, he makes a great fortune, indeed almost lives Presley's life - and
death. He rewards the black lady generously, and the moral is 'Try and make
the people you know happy.' What made me especially happy was the
sympathetic reading by Whoopi Goldberg.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Matchmaker misses the mark - Thornton Wilder at
Chichester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE song goes, 'Who cares if banks fail in Yonkers? As long as you've got
a kiss that conquers.' Love and money have long been travelling companions,
but they rarely meet in Yonkers, save in Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker
(1954), the rewrite of The Merchant of Yonkers (1938) and the blueprint for
Hello Dolly] (1964). The show at the Chichester Festival Theatre is a
disappointing production which gives full scope to Wilder's weaknesses and
adds a few of its own.
Wilder (1897-1975) indulges a quiet look at life's absurdities and
pretensions, half serious but usually entertaining, the mark of a novelist
as well as playwright. The plays themselves are fragile tempered and easily
upset.
The Matchmaker amounts to gentle social and matrimonial farce set in New
York, 1900. The plot shatters into connubial shards at the end, but remains
in the hands of Dolly - the matchmaker - who brings the wealthy merchant
widower Vandergelder from Yonkers to New York and marries him, while
marrying off his chief clerk to Irene, her principle rival, and his heiress
daughter to an impecunious artist.
Patrick Mason's direction allows the scenes to hang around too long, like a
lingering dinner guest. This makes Wilder's meticulous farce look less than
ordinary, limping along between bons mots which seem to issue from a
quotation book rather than from the action itself. Vandergelder unleashes
his views on marriage - 'a bribe to make a housekeeper think she's a
householder' - while Dolly sums up New York: 'I want New York to be more
like Vienna and less like a collection of nervous and tired ants.' Freud did
make a difference.
The sets (Joe Vanek) are standard, fine Chichester fare. First the
Vandergelder store, an anxious green accumulation of officeware; then a
wonderful hat store belonging to Irene, one of Vandergelder's putative
wives; and then a splendid New York balcony and drawing room backed by
canyons of lit skyscrapers.
However, the principals, Prunella Scales as Dolly and Frank Lazarus as
Vandergelder, look uncomfortable in their roles. The gestures are not yet
integrated, their speech not yet consistent. Mason leaves them with too much
dead space around them and too little to do, so they are forever fiddling
and meandering around the stage.
Scales has so far developed an off-hand bossiness; she introduces herself as
'the woman who arranges things', manipulates others by confiding, and wants
Vandergelder's wealth redistributed to 'circulate like rainwater', her own
pennies from heaven.
In contrast, the excellent Isla Blair as Irene fashions a fine character by
trimming a hat or turning her head to flirt. The play's best scenes involve
her with two penniless naives down from Yonkers. First, there is high farce
in cupboards and under tables; yet this finishes with a quiet civil war song
faithful to Wilder's stage directions. And then the evening puts the two
ingenues in Irene's professional charge at an expensive restaurant.
These scenes show that Wilder should not be played too much for laughs. The
the principal characters have short soliloquies to explain themselves and
their roles, like Eliot's knights in Murder in The Cathedral. The best of
these is a journeyman employee, Malachi (well crafted by John Rogan) who
advises against mixing the vices.
Elsewhere, there are highlights, like the coachman who responds to 'Do you
want to earn five dollars?' with 'I dunno, I've never tried' and the girl
who longs for home: 'I wish I was back in Yonkers where nothing happens.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: All lyrical about dirty realism - Stephen Amidon on
the work of American writers who capture the essence of their country /
Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEBODY IN BOOTS by Nelson Algren Flamingo Pounds 5.99, 287 pages
ECLIPSE FEVER by Walter Abish Faber Pounds 14.99, 335 pages
WOMAN HOLLERING CREEK by Sandra Cisneros Bloomsbury Pounds 7.99, 165 pages
FIONA MOON by Melanie Rae Thon Viking Pounds 14.99, 315 pages
NELSON Algren is the hard luck man of American literature. Not only do his
novels deal with men and women down on their fortune, but Algren himself,
who died in 1981, never really received the recognition he was due. While
contemporaries like Steinbeck and Dos Passos went on to achieve immortality,
Algren, every bit their peer, remains in the minor leagues, still awaiting
that posthumous promotion to the pantheon.
It is a sign of this hard luck that Algren's remarkable first novel,
Somebody in Boots, only now receives its first UK printing, 60 years after
it was written. The story details the life and hard times of Cass McKay, a
teenager from a West Texas family so impoverished that Cass dreams of
becoming a hobo. When his father commits murder he gets his opportunity,
hitting the rails for a ride through Depression-era America that is anything
but glorious. He is beaten in a New Orleans whorehouse and jailed in El
Paso. He winds up a petty robber in Chicago, his future no less bleak than
it was back home.
Something in Boots is a masterful book that proves Algren to be a
steely-eyed American novelist of the first order, a writer who seamlessly
blends lyricism with a truly dirty realism. Compare it with the early work
of, say, Steinbeck, and you see the injustice in Algren's relative
anonymity. He was an honest artist who was able to raise righteous anger to
the level of poetry.
Walter Abish is another American novelist hovering on the brink of fame,
having won the PEN/Faulkner Prize and many fans with his first novel, How
German Is It? His latest, Eclipse Fever, concerns a Mexican literary critic,
Alejandro, who becomes embroiled with a nefarious American corporation when
its chairman, Preston Hollier, asks him to write an article praising the
company's plan to build a tourist elevator in the Pyramid of the Sun.
Alejandro, whose wife has just left him for a novelist (surely the most
painful of fates for a critic), soon becomes enmeshed in Hollier's true
agenda - to smuggle pre-Columbian artifacts. Meanwhile, the teenaged
daughter of the writer cuckolding Alejandro travels to Mexico to view a big
eclipse, only to become involved with the art thieves who are supplying
Hollier.
Eclipse Fever is a novel that is at once dense and deft, a book whose
surface is as smooth as glass but whose depths at times appear imponderable.
Abish is a writer of considerable grace and occasionally great acuity, able
to multiply plot lines into seemingly geometric complexity. His take on
contemporary Mexico and its love/hate relationship with its overbearing
northern neighbour is equally perspicacious.
That said, the reader should also be warned that Abish's sensibility is an
oblique one. While his vision is often photographic, he does not seem
particularly interested in arranging his snapshots into the sort of slide
show you can sit back and enjoy. Readers who likes mysteries solved and
enigmas explained will come away from the novel feeling shortchanged by a
book that offers as many ellipses as eclipses.
Mexico also figures strongly in the work of Sandra Cisneros. Her second
book, Woman Hollering Creek, is a skilful and evocative series of short
stories dealing with Mexican-American women trying to live Bel otro lada, or
'on the other side', the US. Whether she be a Chicano artist involved in a
love affair with a labourer who poses for her pseudo-mythic paintings or an
abused Texan wife trying to flee back to her ancestral Mexico, Cisneros's
women all suffer the longings and dangers inherent in being trapped between
cultures.
Another writer who deftly captures what it is like to be a woman caught
between worlds is Melanie Ray Thon. The eponymous heroine of her second
novel, Fiona Moon, is a potato farmer's daughter born into a life of
unrelenting harshness on the outskirts of White Falls, Idaho, where feelings
remain unspoken, where men and women bring each other only misery.
Iona is looked down upon by the other kids, most notably Jay, the town's
golden child who is only interested in her in the back seat of a car. When
her mother falls ill, Iona quits school and leaves town to try to make a
better life. But she soon returns home, where she finds Jay, having suffered
an accident, reassessing a life that had been beautifully charted for him.
They discover that they are not so different after all and give each other
the strength to start anew.
Thon writes with clarity and warmth about coming of age in a life of limited
possibilities, as well as about the stifling effect of rural poverty. Like
Algren, she is able to tap that rich blend of American fiction that seeks
salvation from deprivation in the lyrical.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Galleries off the beaten track - Stagnation in the
property market has provided up-and-coming artists with alternative premises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE recession bit deeper in 1990-91, the pace of gallery closures
accelerated. It became evident that galleries which had been prepared to
take risks with young unknowns, and very likely sell their work to
newly-rich punters in the heady years of the 1980s, could no longer afford
to do so. The galleries that were left played safe with exhibitions of
artists of proven selling power and tended to turn away those who were not.
Young artists graduating in the 1980s had become accustomed to selling well
for high prices at their degree shows. By the turn of the decade it was no
longer so, and the spirit of self-help came to the rescue. The crash in the
property market left a wealth of untenanted accommodation - disused
warehouses, empty shop spaces - which were frequently let to artists on a
short lease as an exhibition venue. Some of these exhibitions were
spectacularly successful, with reputations made overnight, or at any rate
over the course of a few weeks.
A more enduring enterprise is the Delfina Studios Trust, an organisation set
up by philanthropist and patron Delfina Entrecanales at Maryland Works,
Stratford, E15 (Tel 081 519-8841). The purpose of the Trust is to give
working space to selected young artists for a period of one or two years
just when they are at their most vulnerable: they have left college, they
are without a studio and they have no visible means of support, moral or
practical. Some 18 artists are accommodated at one time and their work is
exhibited in a purpose-built gallery twice a year, and the studios may be
visited by appointment.
The non-commercial gallery scene in the East End is jumping. Matt's Gallery,
42-44 Copperfield Road, E3 (Tel 081-983-1771), has been in business since
1979. Run by Robin Klassnik, himself an artist, each exhibition is a
co-operative enterprise between him and the exhibiting artist. In many cases
he has been the first to give a solo exhibition to artists now familiar to a
wide public, such as Tony Bevan, who showed in May/June this year at the
Whitechapel Art Gallery.
Although the gallery is supported by public funds it does from time to time
sell work, perhaps most notably Richard Wilson's oil sump installation,
'20:50', now in the Saatchi Collection. Klassnik commissions four or five
new pieces every year and, with two spaces each measuring 1,600 square feet,
there is always one piece on show in one space whilst another is in
preparation in the other. In 14 years Matt's Gallery has grown from a very
private event into a gallery of international repute, attracting curators
and collectors from all over the world.
Chisenhale Gallery, 64-84 Chisenhale Road, E3 (Tel 081 981-4518) specialises
in innovative contemporary art which is site-specific, created by UK-based
artists and artists from abroad. During the last year or so several of the
exhibitions have achieved a high profile. The gallery commissioned Rose
Finn-Kelcey's steam installation, which is now in the Saatchi Collection;
Grenville Davey's exhibition last November coincided with his winning the
Turner Prize, and Christine Borland and Vong Phaophanit were both in the
Aperto at the Venice Biennale. The matter has been selected as one of the
four contestants for this year's Turner Prize. An exhibition of
collaborative works by Richard Deacon and Bill Woodrow, exhibited in
May/June this year, was supported by the 1992 Prudential Visual Arts Award
Programme.
South of the river, just behind the Design Museum, is the Clove Building, 4
Maguire Street, SE1 (Tel 071 701-5861). Kapil Jariwala founded his gallery
in 1986 in Camberwell, but has now moved to the Clove Building to larger and
more accessible premises. He shows an eclectic range of artists, both
abstract and figurative, and is committed to the notion of the gallery as
forum for new ideas. The paintings and sculptures exhibited are nevertheless
clearly rooted in tradition.
The Cafe Gallery in leafy Southwark Park (Tel 071 232-2170) is an artist-run
gallery founded in 1984. Exhibitions of both established and less well-known
artists are democratically selected, with an emphasis on installation work.
The gallery has had an exchange programme with artists from East Berlin, as
well as integrating the local community into their exhibition plans. One of
the most dramatic installations was Darrell Viner's Wheel.
A few intrepid spirits use their own homes as their gallery. One such is
Maureen Paley, an American who has chosen to live in London. Ms Paley
founded Interim Art, 21 Beck Road, E8 (Tel 071 254-9607) in 1984, and in two
relatively small rooms of her house she has mounted some ground-breaking
exhibitions. Two of her artists, Julie Roberts and Angela Bulloch, were
shown in the Aperto this year.
In West London another home is given over entirely to art. Dr John
Gruzelier, Reader in Psychology at Charing Cross and Westminster Medical
School, founded his gallery, Gruzelier Modern and Contemporary Art, three
years ago at 16 Maclise Road, W14 (Tel 071 603-4540) and now has 10
exhibitions a year of new work. In contrast to the spare hang of a
white-walled gallery, the work is everywhere, as it would be in a domestic
setting. Early on Gruzelier's bias was toward contemporary Scottish painters
such as Ian Howard and David Cook, but he has now broadened the base to
include ceramics and installation work by artists from the UK and abroad.
One such installation is Norwegian artist Kjetil Berge's 'The Prince's
Bedroom' which involves suspending transparent sheets of plastic printed
with gnomic images in three of the rooms (August 2-13).
Off the beaten track these galleries may be, but they have the huge
advantage of being open at weekends when it is easy to get about and easy to
park. The discovery of a hitherto-unknown (to you) artist in a hitherto
unvisited gallery is both pleasurable and fun.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: Wading through the muck - Anthony Curtis finds this
Indian novel loaded with repellent anatomical detail / Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
THE LAST BURDEN by Upamanyu Chatterjee Faber Pounds 14.99, 303 pages
ON THE first page of this novel, the hero Jamun, an unmarried Indian man, a
Hindu who works in insurance and is highly sexed and highly educated, walks
to his office. On the way there he notices in the road a crushed dog from
which 'blood plays like an effluent'. A few pages later he sees 'four
donkeys (mules?) fucking in the dead centre of the road'. They remind him of
the cover of the Classics Illustrated Comics of Cyrano de Bergerac - 'The
donkey's cocks are contoured like Cyrano's nose, only farcically longer, all
but a foot'.
Jamun is urgently trying to get on a flight to his parents' house halfway
across the sub-continent. He has just received a telegram from his brother
Burfi, a few years older and married, containing the news that their mother
Urmila, now in her sixties, has been rushed into Intensive Care. In a letter
preceding the telegram Burfi had explained that 'Ma might have rectal
cancer. It sounds dreadful and is very likely much worse. Haldia (the
physician) said this evening that a lump in the rectum at her age is 75 per
cent cancer'. Our hero broods on his mother's likely fate: '. . . Haldia
will take away her sphincter and perhaps hawk it to a snooty restaurant,
where it might well be used for an hors d'oeuvre . . .'
Had enough? There is more to come. Not only is this novel loaded with
calculatedly repellent anatomical detail, the style in which it is written
is also deliberately off-putting. We know from his earlier novel English,
August (Faber Pounds 5.99) - described on this page when it appeared in 1988
as 'delightful' - that Upamanyu Chatterjee can write with graceful purity.
This time he has chosen to impede the narrative-flow with continual
analogies as Jamun free-associates between past and present in language that
always opts for the recondite word when the simple one will do.
When two enormous cockroaches are discovered in the sour curd Urmila has
prepared for supper, Jamun and his father complain bitterly. There ensues a
family row - one of a great many throughout the book. 'Urmila ebbs away into
hushed, unintelligible moans, like the soughing of the sea on distal sands'.
At first you think that 'distal' there is a mis-print for 'distant' (which
is what it means), but a visit to the Dictionary reveals that it is a
latinate word (like better-known 'dorsal') used in biology to mean the
outermost point of a body or form.
A more frequent affectation is the use of 'suffix' as an intransitive verb
meaning to utter the last biting remark in a spat as you leave the room.
Upamanyu Chatterjee's characters are constantly 'suffixing' one-liners as
they slam the door in a huff. The Dictionary does not give its support this
time. Hitherto 'suffix' as a verb has only existed to describe the
morphology of certain words (when the syllable '-en' is 'suffixed' to the
word 'short' you get the word 'shorten'). What's the betting that the
Chatterjee use of suffix will get into the next edition of the OED?
Examples of such stylistic affectation could be multiplied. They make this a
difficult novel to read, but for those who are prepared to persist, and wade
through all the muck, there are ultimate rewards in store. By the end we do
have a memorably complete picture of one contemporary middle-class Indian
family at the moment when, through the collapse of its great maternal pillar
Urmila, its temple-like structure lies in ruins.
Never can the bonds of love that bind a family together have been expressed
through so much acrimony and ill-feeling. Shyamanand, Jamun's father, is a
dour government official now in retirement who has suffered a massive stroke
resulting in partial paralysis (all recounted in horrendous detail). He
behaves abominably to Urmila and to the other female member of the family
Joyce, his elder son's wife who is a Christian. She has borne him two
naughty grandchildren whose well-described antics are the most human thing
in the book.
The theme of elderly, failing parents and the burden they place on their
offspring, emotional, economic, practical, is a universal one losing nothing
from being placed with such precision and understanding in an Indian
setting. Vikram Seth covered a great deal more ground in A Suitable Boy and
much more readably in spite of that novel's excessive length. Here, in The
Last Burden, we remember its handful of figures almost as if they were
people who have played a significant part in our own lives.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Crazy for - classics] in the West End - Why the London
theatregoer has never had it so good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TANITCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS been so much complaint of late about the West End being over-run
by musicals, and there being very little on to entertain the serious
theatregoer, that I thought it might be interesting to see if things had
been any better in the 1930s and the 1950s.
In the months leading up to the second world war, there were six musicals,
four revues and 13 plays. Emlyn Williams was appearing in his own
autobiographical The Corn is Green with Sybil Thorndike in the role of the
schoolmarm, who helps him win a scholarship to Oxford. Marie Tempest was
starring in Dear Octopus, Dodie Smith's tribute to 'that British institution
the family'. John Mills was having a big success as George, the migrant
labourer, in John Steinbeck's drama of the American Depression, Of Mice end
Men, which the Lord Chamberlain banned initially (on account of its bad
language) and only relented after it had opened at a club theatre to
universally good reviews.
There were comedies by Ben Travers, Lesley Storm and NC Hunter. Best of all
there was a revival of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Ernest with a
definitive cast which included John Gielgud, Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft,
Gwen Francgcon-Davies, Jack Hawkins, Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson.
But this was the only classic revival. The Old Vic was closed, though
earlier in the year it had been possible to see A Midsummer Night's Dream,
She Stoops to Conquer and Ibsen's An Enemy of the People.
In the months leading up to the first night of John Osborne's Look Back in
Anger in June 1956, there were seven musicals, three revues, three variety
shows, 21 plays - three of them thrillers, two by Agatha Christie. The
Mousetrap was in its fifth year.
John Clements was running the Saville Theatre as a national theatre, in the
middle of a season of classical plays which included The Seagull, The
Doctor's Dilemma, The Way of the World and was presenting The Rivals with
himself and Laurence Harvey as Sir Anthony and Captain Absolute with Athene
Seyler as Mrs Malaprop. Paul Scofield and Peter Brook were reviving TS
Eliot's The Family Reunion as part of their season at the Phoenix Theatre,
which included Hamlet and an adaptation of Graham Greene's The Power and the
Glory. At the Old Vic there was Shakespeare, the company being in the third
year of its five year plan to produce all 36 plays.
Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft were appearing in Enid Bagnold's The Chalk
Garden, directed by John Gielgud, hailed by Kenneth Tynan, in a moment of
aberration, as the finest artificial comedy that had flowed from an English
(as opposed from an Irish) pen since the death of Congreve. Hugh Griffiths
was giving a magnificent performance as General St. Pe, a compulsive
womaniser dictating his war memoirs, in Jean Anouilh's characteristically
cynical and bitter The Waltz of the Toreadors.
Eric Portman and Margaret Leighton were playing to full houses in Terence
Rattigan's Separate Tables. Alec Guinness, Irene Worth and Martita Hunt were
giving London its first taste of Georges Feydeau in English in Hotel
Paradiso. Peter Ustinov was enjoying a popular success in his own play,
Romanoff and Juliet, the gentlest of political satires at the expense of the
Russians and Americans. Peggy Mount had become a star overnight in Philip
King and Falkland Carey's Sailor, Beware] Vivien Leigh had turned a minor
Noel Coward comedy, South Sea Bubble into a box office hit and Brian Rix was
losing his trousers in Dry Rot.
So, at first sight, it might seem that things were much 'better' in the
1930s and 1950s than they are today. There were lots of plays and lots of
stars. Nevertheless, in recent months it has been possible to see plays by
Shakespeare, Jonson, Ford, Heywood, Middleton and Rowley, Lope de Vega,
Shadwell, Gay, Farquhar, Moliere, Marivaux, Ostrovsky, Pinero, Chekhov,
Shaw, Pirandello, Priestley, Tennessee Williams, Alan Ayckbourn, Alan
Bennett, Alan Bleasdale, David Hare, Peter Whelan, Tony Kushner and Tom
Stoppard.
But, it will be said, all these plays have been produced by either the Royal
Shakespeare Company or the Royal National Theatre. So what? The RSC and the
RNT did not exist before. Besides, in the West End it has also been possible
to see Oscar Wilde's An ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Ernest,
Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, Noel Coward's Hay Fever, Harold
Pinter's No Man's Land, Peter Shaffer's The Gift of the Gorgon, Arthur
Miller's The Last Yankee, Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea, JB
Priestley's An inspector Calls, Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock and an
adaptation of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt. It has even been
possible to see Shakespeare on Shaftesbury Avenue.
The London theatregoer has never had it so good. Surely, he cannot ask for
more? And if he does, he can go to the Fringe and the opera. The Gate and
ENO have produced some of the best theatre London has seen in the last few
years.
It could be argued that the serious theatregoer no longer needs the West
End. High production values are guaranteed at the RNT and RSC, the seats are
cheaper, the foyers are more spacious and audiences can park their cars.
But what then is going to happen to modern authors who do not fit into the
RNT and RSC or indeed the Royal Court repertoire? Now that there are few
stars who are capable of filling a theatre on their names alone, the chance
of a new play attracting investment becomes more and more unlikely. Brian
Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa only got into the West End after its critical
and box-office success at The National; and this is also true of Shaffer,
Miller and the Rattigan, Pinter and Priestley revivals, all having to rely
on the subsidised theatre to produce them initially. In order for
productions to succeed in the commercial theatre they have to be turned into
events and clearly an event now means either a musical by Andrew Lloyd
Webber or a revival of a famous classic with Maggie Smith, who is the only
British actress these days who can ensure massive advance bookings before
the play has opened.
Actor Timothy West recently suggested to me that one solution would be for
some of the smaller theatres (eg The Duchess, The Fortune and The
Ambassadors) to be turned into 'off-West End' theatres where actors would
not be paid West End prices and straight plays could play to a minority
audience for an open-ended run with a top price of Pounds 14 and the bulk of
the seats at Pounds 10. This would, of course, involve not only negotiations
with theatre unions, but also with the theatre owners who would have to be
willing to reduce their rents. It is plain that unless something is done,
the present situation will continue.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Records: The best of British - Garry Booth reviews jazz
talent new and old
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT WITH our weather and weird licensing laws, you would not think that
Britain could grow too many jazz musicians suitable for export. But we
continue to produce new talent and just about sustain the old hands. Pianist
Julian Joseph is part of the new crop and with the release of his second
album, Reality (East West 4509-93024), he maintains the momentum started by
last year's surging The Language of Truth.
Second albums are always hard to pitch, especially if the first has been a
critical success, and Joseph has responded here by lowering the temperature
and replacing the soul vocals of Sharon Musgrave with his own crooning on
two tracks. The first ploy works, the right hand shimmering while strong
left-hand chords control the dynamic of Joseph's well wrought compositions
darkly. The mid-Atlantic crooning is a mistake, however. Its flatness
deflates the late night atmosphere created by saxophonists Jean Toussaint
and altoist Pete King and the half-baked lyrics are hard to swallow. As a
cursed second album, it is a qualified success.
Guitarist Jim Mullen, who has cult followings from Havana to Putney, is one
of the old hands we only just sustain. The Glaswegian, who has played in
more pubs than Eric Bristow, was most often found seated beside tenorist
Dick Morrissey spinning off lithe, dancing solos. But Soundbites (EFZ 1003),
an unexpected pleasure, shows Mullen moving away from the British jazz funk
sound the pair pioneered to original bop compositions. Tenorist Dave
O'Higgins, another fine player who has difficulty staying in the limelight,
intersperses Mullen's taut lines with grainy choruses which combine to
produce a thoroughly English and restrained form of post bop.
Mullen turns up again with his old sparring partner Morrissey on a Willesden
produced paean to 1960s soul jazz and the Hammond organ. Mike Carr's Good
Times &amp; the Blues (Cargogold CGCD 191) is swingingly greasy as Blue Note's
finest. The tough talking compositions all belong to Carr and he drives both
trio and quartet with the bass pedals of a fast moving but agile C3
juggernaut.
What makes British jazz fundamentally different, arguably, is the direct
link to Africa via the blues which defines American contemporary music.
Nowhere is that living connection better demonstrated than in the music of
pianist Randy Weston. Volcano Blues (Verve 519269) reunites the North
African explorer with arranger Melba Liston for 13 sides of bright swaying
big band charts, spiced with African colour, the whole stewed in the blues.
To hear Hamiett Bluiett (baritone sax), Teddy Edwards (tenor) and Miles'
heir Wallace Roney jostling with Obo Addy (percussion), Jamil Nasser (bass)
and Talib Kibwe (alto sax) is a natural delight.
If Weston shows us where American jazz music comes from, the woofer testing,
heavy kicking tunes of electric bassist Marcus Miller shows where some of it
is going. The Sun Don't Lie (Dreyfus FDM365 602) features Wayne Shorter
(tenor sax), David Sanborn (alto sax) and even the late-Miles Davis among
many others in a bewilderingly high powered, jazz funk tour de force. Miller
 -producer, composer and virtuoso bassist - has a knack for matching
commerciality with credible licks and this latest outing should find favour
with the jazz fans.
A major influence on Miller and a model for many upcoming electric bass
players is the late Jaco Pastorius. At the time of his sudden, violent death
in 1987, the American was shaping a solo career which involved innovative
big band schemes. The Japanese reissue Holiday for Pans (Sound Hills
SSCD-8001), which features steel drums, is both grand folly and elegant
masterwork. It employs 12 musicians, Toots Thielmens and Wayne Shorter
included, with the Mike Gibbs Orchestra plus strings thrown in for good
measure. It is not cheap at Pounds 22 but worth every penny to hear the
Beatles 'She's Leaving Home' done by steel drum in a jazz setting.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Record: A choice of Elijahs - Ronald Crichton reviews some
hefty choral works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DAYS gone by Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah was regarded in musical
circles more or less as part of the British Empire. It was indeed written
for the Birmingham Festival and first given there, in 1846. But Mendelssohn
set the German words, as Elias, before taking immense trouble to fit his
vocal lines to an English text (like the German, based on the Bible). Now,
back once more in the repertory, Elijah has become international. Two new
recordings, made as far apart as Metz and Tel Aviv, both use the German
words. For Teldec (9031 73131-2, 2 CDs.) Kurt Masur conducts the MDR (Middle
German Radio) Choir from Leipzig and the Israel Philharmonic. For Harmonia
Mundi France (HMC 901463-64, 2 CDs) Philippe Herreweghe conducts the
Chapelle Royale and Collegium Vocale with the Orchestra des Champs-Elysees.
Both readings stress the drama in Elijah: I prefer Herreweghe because he
presents the vivid episodes (the widow, the boy scanning the sky for signs
of rain, the whirlwind) even more sharply than Masur. He is more successful
in disguising the musical decline during the last third or so of the work.
Mendelssohn had much difficulty at this stage with his librettist, Pastor
Schubring. The Pastor was all for moral uplift; the composer wanted more
drama. And Mendelssohn was a tired man, sadly overworked. He died one year
after the first performance.
The Elijahs are both outstanding young singers: Peter Salomaa (Harmonia
Mundi) and Alexander Miles (Teldec). Salomaa sounds almost too young, less a
Prophet than a promising young priest highly thought of by his Bishop. Miles
suggests more experience and authority. All Herreweghe's soloists are
remarkable: Soile Isokoski a radiant soprano, Monica Groop (whom I admired
recently as the Composer in Strauss's Ariadne at the Opera-Comique in Paris)
a strong alto, John Mark Ainsley a characterful, unsentimental tenor.
Masur's Helen Donath and Jard van Nes are correct, rather dull, his tenor
Donald George a little too sweet.
Herreweghe has the better recording chamber - the Arsenal at Metz, a new
concert hall by Ricardo Bofill. In the Frederic R. Mann Auditorium in Tel
Aviv Masur's chorus and orchestra too often melt into a thick paste,
obscuring one of the admirable qualities of this score, the orchestral
tone-painting - to give one example, the gentle, Hebrides - style swirls and
eddies behind the voices in 'Blessed are the men who fear Him', hardly
perceptible here. Lucky owners of the old HMV/Angel LPs with the New
Philharmonia under Fruhbeck de Burgos, should hold on to them. Quite apart
from the impressive soloists led by Fischer-Dieskau, resplendent as the
Prophet, the balance is finer, providing as it were an extra dimension.
Peter Cornelius, composer of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, was
even more versatile and civilised than Mendelssohn - nephew of the painter
of the same name, actor, writer, poet. In Weimar and Vienna he came into the
orbits of Liszt, Berlioz and Wagner, but, in Ernest Newman's words, never
lost 'his modest independence of manner'. That he had something of his own
to keep is proved by the Stabat Mater recorded for Harmonia Mundi France
(HMA 1905206) by the Choir and Orchestra of Cannes-Provence-Alpes-Cotes
d'Azur under Michel Piquemal. The stylish performance should give a sharp
jolt to any British listener too complacent to believe that such a standard
can be found in a region so little associated with such music.
According to Grove the date of the Stabat Mater is 1849, before Cornelius
went to Weimar. This may explain the absence of obvious influences but not
the assurance and quiet distinction of the work. Of the four soloists the
soprano has the most to do and Danielle Borst does it well. The companion
piece, Requiem, is not the Mass for the Dead but a setting for unaccompanied
chorus of a mourning poem by Hebbel, one of Cornelius's eminent literary
friends.
Two hefty choral works of the present century which one reads about but very
seldom hears are the Psalm 47 (O clap your hands) of Florent Schmitt and the
Psalm 80 (Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel) of Roussel. A reissue on CD
(French EMI, CDM 7 64368 2) of recordings made in Paris in the early 1970s
provides a welcome chance of getting to know them. Schmitt's Psalm 47 is a
late-Romantic score stuffed with barbaric colour and pulsating rhythm.
Meanly one wonders if repeated hearings may not reveal pinchbeck behind the
sumptuous glitter, but it is a wickedly enjoyable sonic experience, hurled
at one with total conviction by conductor Jean Martinon (an expert in this
repertory) and the Choirs and National Orchestra of French Radio. Fanfare
piles on fanfare, the soprano soloist Andrea Guiot threads her way through
the tapestry, there is still room for the organ (Gaston Litaize) to top it
all. The recording is surprisingly successful in accommodating so much
sound.
Nothing pinchbeck about the Roussel Psalm 80 (1929) which Frederick Goldbeck
called 'as grand a sacred score as was ever composed by an agnostic'.
Roussel insisted on setting the English text from the Authorised Version. He
stressed some of it wrongly, but since the French translation is used here
that hardly matters. Roussel has as much rhythmic vigour as Schmitt but his
colours are bracing rather than sensuous. The final section is particularly
striking, with the chorus softly pleading to the Lord 'cause thy face to
shine; and we shall be saved' over dying pizzicatos. Serge Baudo, a reliable
conductor but less fiery than Martinon, directs the Stephane Caillat Choir
(very good) and the Orchestre de Paris. John Mitchinson is the tenor
soloist. A nice change from normal oratorio diet.

THE QUESTION is not utterly stupid; for if 'No' is an impossible reply,
there is still healthy room for a 'Yes - within limits]' The limits will
depend upon how much you include within 'musicianliness'. If that takes in
everything that makes for an effective performance, there can be no
argument; but as pianists become more and more reluctant to be identified as
'brilliant technicians' - thought to be a glut on the market, though I would
not agree - the recognised marks of the Serious Musician become ever more
austere.
The trouble with that is that the best part of the piano repertoire makes
knowing room for virtuoso magic on its unique instrument. Composers are well
aware that each note on a piano is unalterable, once struck, though it can
be allowed to die away more or less quickly; not being a true 'sustaining'
instrument, it can only mimic a singing legato. On the other hand, with its
multi-fingered attack, its damper-pedal and its rich octave-resonances, the
piano can conjure up sounds like nothing else.
Figuration is the name of the game, the art of titivating music for the
keyboard. Too many performances on my current batch of piano CDs make too
little of that, especially where the composers expected pure pianism to
carry the day without extending the musical argument by very much. On Sony
SK 53 108, for example, Andreas Haefliger offers as searching and purposeful
readings of eight Schubert Impromptus - the wonderful late sets, D899 and
935 - as I have heard in some time; I shall return to them often.
And yet: these pieces contain some of Schubert's most memorably pretty
piano-writing, passages of inspired delicacy that no music-lover can forget
 -and Haefliger is resolutely un-charming with them ('charmless' would be
unfair). Lesser pianists often capture the authentic shimmer better.
Melvyn Tan's EMI programme of mostly lesser Beethoven (CDC 7 54526 2) makes
an intriguing comparison. On Beethoven's own Broadwood piano (much restored,
I think), he plays Bagatelles early and late, and the G minor Fantasia, with
the basically silly variation-sets on 'God Save the King' and 'Rule
Britannia' fore and aft. There is any amount of quirky charm here, just as
required. Nothing over-fanciful, but Tan's clever rubato - and the chunky,
sinewy appeal of the instrument - bring the music immediately to life; and
he is equal to the visionary last Bagatelles, op. 126 (virtually
contemporary with those Schubert Impromptus).
The remarkable Yevgeny Kissin, who is still young enough to count as a
prodigy, is immaculate - if a touch sober - in solo Grieg and Liszt on Sony
SK 52 567. The main offering, however, is the evergreen Schumann Concerto,
where Kissin is unsuitably yoked with the veteran conductor Giulini and the
Vienna Philharmonic. There are exquisitely realised passages, but too often
the pianist is audibly struggling against Giulini's moody tempi: a fresh,
buoyant performance is half-stifled amid all that leisurely reverence.
On EMI (CDC 7 54548 2), Lars Vogt - distinguished second prizewinner at the
last Leeds competition, after Arthur Pizzarro - underplays the salon charms
of his Tchaikovsky fill-ups, the Dumka and three of the 'Seasons' pieces. A
sonata by his Russian wife, Tatiana Komarova, is sweetly Skryabinesque, and
leaves no great mark. In Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition, however,
he has any number of subtle ideas, deeply musical and always respectful of
the text. All that one misses is a sense that the chicks' 'Ballet', the
'Marketplace at Limoges' and 'Baba Yaga' are tremendous pianistic fun: Vogt
is excellent, but excessively polite.
We have needed a proper account of Balakirev's posthumous Piano Concerto,
and Malcolm Binns - with David Lloyd-Jones conducting the English Northern
Philharmonia, thoroughly idiomatic - has now supplied one (Hyperion CDA
66640), along with Rimsky-Korsakov's less substantial concerto. Binns is
fully equal to Balakirev's athletic demands, as also to his twinkling charm.
Just here and there, one would like harder fingers: some of Balakirev's best
pianistic trouvailles trade upon the effect of an unstoppable mechanism.
In Busoni's monster Concerto with male chorus (Koch CD 311 160 H1), the
American pianist goes through the hoops with tireless panache - which is all
he needs to do, for his is essentially a noisy concertante role. The music,
broad but not very complicated, rests in the safe hands of Michael Gielen,
conducting the Sudwestfunk Symphony. Busoni fans will have to have it.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: When powerful codes of conduct ruled - A treatise on
Victorian etiquette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT BLAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DESCENT OF MANNERS: ETIQUETTE, RULES AND THE VICTORIANS by Andrew St
George Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 330 pages
THIS IS a highly learned and acutely perceptive book about a little-studied
aspect of Victorian history - the esoteric yet powerful codes of conduct
that ruled society in the 1850s and 1860s. As the century wore on these came
to be relaxed. 'Personality for the mid-Victorians functioned on the public
stage, lit by moral certainties and prompted by etiquette books. As the
scientific 1870s began to explore the mind's workings . . . the relation of
the public acting to the private thinking self began to alter.'
The world of Oscar Wilde was very different from that of Martin Tupper or
Samuel Smiles, whose relentless moral preaching was supplanted by that
combination of romance, candour and cynicism associated with the fin de
siecle. This was itself a reaction against another blow to mid-Victorian
certainties - Darwinism, with its implications for faith and religion. The
Decadents and the Scientists did not agree with each other but neither group
had any use for the intellectual culture of the days of the Great
Exhibition.
This is a subtle and somewhat discursive book which needs to be read with
care and with some previous knowledge of 19th century history - American as
well as British, for one of the author's six chapters is devoted to
'American Manners and Transatlantic Attitudes'. It is one of the most
interesting sections of a fascinating book.
In discussing the Ladies Pocket Book of Etiquette (1838), published in
Liverpool and convenient for the boat to New York, St. George defines the
difference between manners and the subject of that book. Manners is 'the way
we relate to everyone else and etiquette the way an individual relates to
others in the same class or narrow 'society''. In a recent interview on
Radio 4 with an abrasive Australian woman, St. George made the point that
good manners are a matter of putting yourself in the place of the people you
are meeting and behaving accordingly with civility, courtesy and tolerance.
It is for example customary in American etiquette (ie arbitrary usage) first
to cut up the meat on your plate and then to eat it with fork only, or in
China to put your guest of honour on your left, not right. But good manners
in any society forbids noisy interruption of other people's conversation, or
barrack room expletives in mixed company, or symptoms of boredom with your
neighbour. As Lord Chesterfield observed in his famous Letters, 'Be
therefore, I beg of you, not only really, but seemingly and manifestly
attentive to whoever speaks to you'. Chesterfield long pre-dated the
Victorians but their books on manners were largely based on his, with the
addition, as St. George puts it, of 'popular morals and stringent religious
conformism appealing to a system which lay outside that of class or social
relations'.
In this book he uses 'manners' in an even wider sense, more like the OED
definition as 'conditions of society'. He takes as his text John Stuart
Mill's observation: 'The English, more than any other people, not only act
but feel according to rule.' The successive gurus of this attitude were
Tupper first and then Smiles. Tupper's Proverbial Wisdom is written in a
cringe-making prose/poetry. Shelley maintained that poets were 'the
unacknowledged legislators of the world' (though one can doubt whether any
Bill drafted by him would have got very far with the Clerks of Parliament).
Tupper really did for a time lay down the moral law for the British middle
class. He was not as silly as his critics later made out. A man who defeated
Gladstone for the Theology Prize at Christ Church, Oxford, could not have
been a fool.
But fashions change. The evangelical simplicities which conditioned his
outlook faded away and a spiteful sonnet on him referred in its last line to
his works as 'A monstrous pile of quintessential ROT]' Smiles never became a
comparable figure of fun. He wisely stuck to prose. His best-selling
Self-Help used biographical examples rather than flowery admonitions to make
his point. He continued to be widely read well into the 1880s.
Andrew St. George has written a book which will be obligatory reading for
students of Victorian history. He covers a wide range of subjects -
furniture; the 1851 Exhibition; the Contagious Diseases Acts; financial
successes and frauds; the effect of Darwin and Huxley on thought and
religion; the details about calling and leaving cards; clothes, clubs and
courtship. I was left with one question mark. If Mill was right about the
English being unusual in feeling as well as acting according to rule, why
did they differ from other European countries? Perhaps in some later work
the author will give us an answer.

THE ERN MALLEY AFFAIR by Michael Heyward Faber Pounds 15.99, 284 pages
ONE SATURDAY afternoon in Melbourne in 1943 two clever young men invented
the works of a poet they called Ern Malley. They also invented his life and
character - a lower middle class insurance clerk whose only education had
been in public libraries, who had apparently had an unhappy love affair, and
who had died unknown and alone of Graves' disease at 25. Then they wrote a
carefully semi-literate letter from his sister Ethel, enclosing some of the
poems she had found among his belongings, to Max Harris, surrealist poet and
editor of a determinedly avant-garde magazine called Angry Penguins.
Harris was bowled over. So were his colleagues, John Reed, a rich patron,
and a young painter called Sidney Nolan. Together they produced a special
edition of Angry Penguins to commemorate Ern Malley. The entire oeuvre of 16
poems was introduced by Harris in very excited terms: 'a poet of tremendous
power, working through a disciplined and restrained kind of statement into
the deepest wells of human experience.' For the cover, Nolan produced a very
colourful painting to illustrate Malley's lines: 'I said to my love (who is
living)/ Dear we shall never be that verb/Perched on the sole Arabian
Tree./( Here the peacock blinks the eyes of his multi-pennate tail).'
The hoax was fairly quickly exposed, not through critical judgment, but
through a leak by a journalist friend of the perpetrators. There was the
most tremendous stir. Harris was vilified with orgiastic glee by a press
whose philistinism could show a clean pair of heels to today's Sun.
Then, not satisfied with this demonstration that, as they had always
thought, poetry was bogus, the South Australian authorities prosecuted
Harris for the alleged indecency of his non-existent poet. In a surreal
court case, Detective Vogelesang (later awarded a medal for his successful
prosecution) said at one point, 'l don't know what 'incestuous' means but I
think there is a suggestion of indecency about it.'
All good clean fun. But is it worth a book 50 years later? The answer is
certainly Yes. Robert Hughes, who introduces the book, claims the affair to
have been 'without question, the literary hoax of the 20th century'; and
Michael Heyward's excellent account makes clear why.
First, it was an act of passionate and devastatingly successful literary
criticism. Its authors, James McAuley and Harold Stewart, were to emerge as
distinguished poets in their own right. At the time of the hoax they were
unknown but possessed pseud-detectors as sensitive as their near
contemporaries across the globe - whom they must have resembled in many ways
 -Amis and Larkin. They abominated the surrealist movement represented by
Dylan Thomas and George Barker in England and energetically followed by
Harris, which they saw as inflated, undisciplined rubbish. The Malley affair
stopped the movement dead in its tracks. It became impossible to write even
remotely like this in Australia for 20 years.
But what is really interesting in the affair is the poems themselves.
Hayward prints all of them and they can be clearly seen as far from simple
pastiche or parody or even, indeed, as completely meaningless. They are
quirky, witty and evocative, daring even the reader who knows all about
their creation to dismiss them entirely. They have attracted quite a cult
following and have been reprinted a number of times, most recently in 1991
in a Penguin anthology of modern Australian verse.
Harris's supporters, beginning with Herbert Read, who bravely said that he
too would have been taken in, have maintained that the hoaxers builded
better than they knew; that being genuine poets and allowing themselves to
free-associate they justified the tenets of surrealism by producing true
poetry. There may be something in this, though it is pretty clear that the
authors were in full conscious control of their material.
Whatever one's views on the merits of the poetry, the affair is undoubtedly
fascinating. Perhaps it forms a test case for structuralists and others who
regard authorship as irrelevant in evaluating a text. Or perhaps it simply
justifies George Melly's view that true surrealists always attract surreal
events.

WARTIME AND AFTERMATH: ENGLISH LITERATURE AND ITS BACKGROUND by Bernard
Bergonzi Oxford Pounds 30, 230 pages
ENGLISH literature during the second world war and its aftermath is a
fascinating topic but a tricky one because there are still a lot of people
around who lived through the period.
Previous books on literature in the OPUS series have taken a safer line. JA
Burrows's subject, for example, was Medieval Writers and their Work,
1100-1500 and the Regius Professor of English at Cambridge wrote on
Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries 1760-1830. You have got to be either
very brave or very insensitive to tackle your own period in your own
country.
Emeritus Professor Bernard Bergonzi's book is the sort of chatty account
which the late GS Fraser used to write. In fact, Bergonzi makes more of
Fraser than of many better writers - even to citing, with apparent approval,
his potty judgment on Dylan Thomas that he was 'below Thomas Gray but
perhaps on a level with William Collins'. Another favourite of Bergonzi's,
Donald Davie, is quoted as 'deploring the anachronism of Dylan Thomas
playing in 1940 the Rimbaud game' - as good an example of a molehill
criticising a mountain as one could wish to find.
What Bergonzi misses, because - as he admits in his Preface - he was 'a
schoolboy during the war years', is the excitement of those days when you
came home on leave and had the heady experience of seeing Stephen Spender in
his fireman's uniform, of hearing WS Graham reading his mesmerising poems
from Cage without Grievance, and of threading your way through the falling
bombs to the Streatham Locarno clutching a copy of Modern Reading.
Bergonzi relies too heavily on recent accounts by such American academics as
Paul Fussell, whose dubious theories bear no relation to the facts. Where
are Fred Marnau and Wrey Gardiner; where is Howard Sergeant, manfully
producing Outposts year after year; where is the infamous Caton of the
Fortune Press whose caricature appears in so many of Kingsley Amis's early
novels? Where are the anthologies of poetry from Oxford and Cambridge in
wartime, of Poems from the Forces?
While we are on the poets, Bergonzi makes no mention of some of the older
figures who were still going strong in the 1940s and '50s: Walter de la
Mare, Edmund Blunden, Basil Bunting, Roy Campbell, Vernon Watkins. There are
some even odder omissions - Gavin Ewart, for example, Kenneth Allott, Norman
McCaig, Alex Comfort, Denise Levertov, Paul Dehn, Jon Silkin, Dannie Abse,
Norman Nicholson, Vernon Scannell, James Kirkup, Christopher Logue, Laurie
Lee, WR Rodgers. Christopher Fry receives some space but there is not even a
whisper of Ronald Duncan. There is also the automatic assumption - made by
so many British academics - that TS Eliot is an English writer, despite the
fact that he was born by the banks of the Mississippi, returned to his New
England roots, read the Upanishads like Emerson and preferred the 'lucidity'
of Dante to the 'opacity' of Shakespeare.
However, the reader who has followed the story so far will be relieved to
hear that the book gets better as it goes on. This is partly because
Bergonzi gives us less potted history and more literary discussion (like the
excellent comparison between Hugh McDiarmid and David Jones) and partly
because he concentrates on the novel. Even here his judgment leaves
something to be desired: Wyndham Lewis and Anthony Powell are overrated, for
example. The coverage of Waugh, Durrell, Burgess, Wilson, Amis, Wain, etc.
is adequate but not inspiring. Bergonzi's opinions arouse contention rather
than approval, so that I cannot see this book going down well with the
British public. As an outline it might be helpful to, say, a Japanese
reader, but Bergonzi is holding up a mirror to an extraordinarily turbulent
time without synthesising what he sees.

SLEEPING ON A WIRE by David Grossman Jonathan Cape Pounds 17.99, 326 pages
LEBANON, FIRE AND EMBERS by Dilip Hiro Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 25, 274
pages
IN 1987 David Grossman's book The Yellow Wind, based on conversations with
Palestinians in the occupied territories, was published to considerable
acclaim. It gave Israelis some thought-provoking and painful reading.
Sleeping on a Wire, using a similar technique of interviews, will surely do
so even more, for it deals with a problem far closer to the bone - a
problem, moreover, which too many Israelis have contrived to ignore for too
long: their relations with their own Palestinian Arab minority.
After Israel's war of independence in 1948, about 160,000 Palestinian Arabs
remained within the borders of the Jewish state. Today they number close to
a million. More than 40 years of living as citizens of a state they never
felt was truly theirs has given them an unhappy identity, which became
increasingly ambiguous since 1967 when they came into direct contact with
their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza. For the latter the
on-going revolt - the Intifada - has been a desperate act of defiance. For
the former it has given rise to self-questioning and revived memories.
Arabic is an official language in Israel, yet few Jews speak it and few if
any national institutes will correspond in Arabic. The Office for Arab
Affairs has been for years an unprestigious department within the Prime
Minister's Office. Compared with other Arab societies in the Middle East,
Israeli Arabs have fared well in terms of health, education and standard of
living - all of which has deepened their resentment at the discrimination
they have been subjected to in Israel, a discrimination which has been as
harsh as any that Jews have endured in Arab countries in modern times.
When the Intifada erupted in 1987 new challenges shook the Israeli
Palestinians, forcing them to re-examine their aspirations, their attitudes,
their destiny. These crucial dilemmas are at the core of Mr Grossman's
excellent and searching study.
If, as he seems to believe, many Israeli Jews now accept that the eventual
creation of a Palestinian state is on the cards, Israeli Palestinians have
no doubts about it. But what will their part in it be?
Given the choice, the vast majority of Israeli Palestinians would not want
to leave Israel for a newly-founded Palestinian state. The difficulty lies
not in identifying with Israel as their country but in a complex
constitutional peculiarity of Israel: its insistence on defining itself as a
Jewish State, thereby diminishing the status of its non-Jewish population.
It is over this problem that even the most moderate, peace-loving Arabs and
Jews fail to reach agreement.
Perhaps the historic memory of the two nations - of the Jews in particular -
prevents a compromise on this issue. So what is to be done? Two
possibilities are explored here: autonomy for the Israeli Palestinians in
their own canton (ironically, the idea was first mooted by Ze'ev Jabotinsky,
the spiritual leader of the right-wing Likud), which is unacceptable to the
Jews; or the 'transfer' of the Israeli Palestinians to the new Palestinian
state, which is what Palestinians fear might come to pass if the extreme
right in Israel ever gains ascendancy.
Mr Grossman offers no solutions of his own. Probably there are none for the
time being. But at least it seems that at many levels of Israeli society
there is now the readiness to discuss, even to understand.
Before it was torn apart by 15 years of civil war, Lebanon presented to the
outside world an image of peaceful oriental elegance; it was the Switzerland
of the Middle East. The image concealed a precarious reality which bubbled
like lava in a volcano.
Hiro, a perceptive Middle East writer, offers an assured guidance through
the intricacies of Lebanon's ethnic and political currents. It is a solid,
well-documented, comprehensive and comprehensible account.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: Adult comics grow up - Now that Doris Lessing has
turned to the graphic novel, will publishers and the public take them
seriously?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMAN is dead, Batman has taken early retirement, and I'm beginning to
feel a little dizzy myself. Readers everywhere who regard their literary
taste as fully formed are experiencing anxiety attacks with the advent of
the graphic novel.
Opinions of the newly established genre vary widely. Aficionados and
promoters hail graphic novels as a highly expressive and versatile medium
midway between the video and the printed page, with images and words
dovetailing to mutual advantage. Detractors deride them as expensive adult
comics for those of limited attention span and questionable taste.
Literary snobs have long been at best bemused, and at worst contemptuous, of
intelligent grown-ups who confess an interest in so-called comics, however
disguised. But now that video animations of Shakespeare are sold alongside
Hollywood celluloid blockbusters, the barriers between high art and popular
entertainment are blurring.
When a writer of Doris Lessing's stature turns to the graphic novel, an
overhaul of preconceived ideas about the relative merits of different media
is clearly in order.
'I have always hated putting things in boxes - conventional novels good,
graphic novels or science fiction bad, for example,' says Ms Lessing, whose
first venture into the genre of 'sequential art', Playing The Game, is to be
published by HarperCollins. An iconoclast by temperament, she helped bring
respectability to science fiction with her five haute SF works in the
Shikasta series, written between 1979 and 1983.
She hopes that her latest work will have a similarly positive effect. Not
only has she set out to explode the perception that graphic novels form a
sub-class of literature unworthy of serious attention, but she also has a
hidden philanthropic agenda. She wants to open the door of the empowering
kingdom of books to the dispossessed.
'It sounds sentimental, I know, but I am haunted by the vision of all those
kids out there who are disqualified from the whole of culture, who perceive
it as 'not for us'. It troubles me that they are unnecessarily excluded by
those who don't even know they are doing it,' she says.
An Australian artist friend whose background mirrors the audience she aims
to reach was the inspiration for her own exploration of the graphic novel:
'He came from a working class home which had no books in it, but he did read
comics. One day he dropped into a picture gallery and decided there and then
to become a graphic artist. It seems a very casual link but his example has
stayed with me.'
The genre has evolved far beyond the early 'Zap, Pow' imagery associated
with superhero titles. The superhero has in fact been largely superseded.
Today's graphic novels are of a different order entirely.
Ms Lessing explains: 'I have deliberately used verse, and a more elaborate
and interesting language, to try to broaden the range of the genre in terms
of the words.' Her characters, too, are deliberately designed to shatter
stereotypes: one is an eyecatching mix of black girl with ginger hair and
blue eyes.
The only limitations, she argues, are the imaginations of creators - of the
writers and artists themselves. 'There is nothing to stop the graphic novel
taking off now in all kinds of unexpected directions.'
Anecdotal evidence suggests that demand for graphic novels is also taking
off in unusual directions: booksellers have complained that copies are being
stolen in quantity and Southend-on-Sea Central Library is progressive enough
to boast a graphic novels lending section.
Can graphic novels buck the recessionary trend within book publishing
internationally? Gone are the days when a publisher had only to sell 4,000
copies of a paperback original in order to break even. A typical print run
for the more lavishly produced graphic novel is 15,000 copies. And high
quality printing is all-important, as Malcolm Edwards, HarperCollins
publishing director, ruefully observes: 'If you're asking someone to pay
Pounds 7 or more for a comic, you'd better produce it well'.
Gone too are the days when the most competitive production quote invariably
came from the Far East. Although Hong Kong continues to offer keen prices,
graphic novels are now frequently typeset and printed in Spain, Scandinavia
and Scotland.
Encouraged by worldwide sales of the graphic version of The Hobbit and by
the intuitions of their US partner Eclipse, a specialist comics publisher,
HarperCollins is gambling heavily by making the necessary investment. Its
programme is to bring out two dozen by December 1994, for publication on
both sides of the Atlantic, with big print runs and consequent cost savings.
Titan Books, the publishing arm of the Forbidden Planet specialist
bookshops, was created expressly to capitalise on a prospective demand for
graphic novels. Its commercial judgment vindicated, Titan has now broken
into mainstream bookshops, notably WH Smith. Smith's carried The Death of
Superman - in which the progenitor of all superheroes dies protecting
Metropolis from the villain Doomsday - in large quantities for the
pre-Christmas sale. While it is clear that worldwide sales of graphic novels
do not yet represent a significant fraction of sales compared to mainstream
publishing, they do have all the signs of an emerging force.
Whatever happens, superhero art will never be the same again. Frank Miller,
an American pioneer in the field, deserves mention for his almost
singlehanded achievement of steering the remaining superhero comics away
from the simplistic moral polarities of the 1940s and 1950s, when Captain
America grappled with the Nazi Red Skull and Green Lantern mopped up
gangsters in the big US cities, into the muddied moral universe of today.
Between the early Batman and Superman plot-lines and Miller's ageing
maladjusted crimefighter in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, published by
Titan, there yawns an uncrossable gulf. Comic art has now, for better or
worse, come of age.
The brief history of graphic novels publishing has already had several high
points. In the UK, first among titles striving to extend the repertoire of
the more socially-aware graphic novel stands The Minotaur's Tale, written
and illustrated by Al Davison, published by Gollancz. According to its
editor, Faith Brooker, it is 'about a disabled man's struggle to survive in
the community as it is now.' The plotline cannot really support the numerous
visual allusions to Greek mythology, Joyce and Robert Graves, but such
overambition is an acceptable fault.
The Yattering and Jack, published by HarperCollins and written by Clive
Barker with John Bolton and Hector Gomez as illustrators, concerns a
character (with a striking visual resemblance to Philip Larkin) whom a minor
demon is ordered to drive insane. It is funny, scary, and contains some
thought-provoking theology.
If Neil Gaiman's and Dave McKean's Signal To Noise, published by Gollancz,
about a terminally ill film director working furiously to complete a script
which he will never see screened, is not a work of high art, I am a samovar.
KlingKlangKlatch, written by Ian McDonald, illustrated by David Lyttleton,
also on the Gollancz list, is a sharply observed serie noir thriller whose
chief protagonist is a streetwise teddy bear police inspector trying to stop
a serial killer on the loose in Panda Town. Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but
who would have predicted that the adventures of a colony of rabbits or of a
community of moles would have attracted a cult following and topped the
adult fiction bestseller lists, as Richard Adams' Watership Down and William
Horwood's Duncton Wood have done?
Is this the end of civilisation as we know it, or are we privileged instead
to be witnessing the birth pangs of a genuinely new medium? Picture it: a
virulent, powerfully addictive art form filters through language barriers to
colonise imaginations worldwide, covertly influencing readers for good or
ill. It sounds like a promising opening for the plot of a graphic novel.

<TEXT>
GROUSE-shooting started two days ago, but there is not the usual joy.
Bookings have been slow, sporting agents report, reflecting Lloyd's losses
and general anxiety.
A tale of woe? Not necessarily. The English and southern Scottish moors will
bounce back in a year as nature corrects itself. In the Highlands, many
owners will wait till next month to start regular shoots. An unusual season
will thus run into October and may end not so badly after all.
If 1993 is a late year, it will still be expensive as prices for shooting
have not fallen. Regardless of the sport, owners have costs, and a large
moor needs three or four keepers. Few owners can afford to run their moors
for themselves and friends. The usual system now is to let off days of
shooting with a contract specifying an agreed number of birds.
The price in the Highlands is Pounds 80-Pounds 85 a brace (plus VAT) for
driven grouse, when beaters drive the birds towards the guns. A typical
contract for eight guns will specify 60 brace. In northern England the price
may be Pounds 60 a brace, for 200 pairs. The resulting bills easily reach
Pounds 500 a gun a day in Scotland and Pounds 1,000 in England. Let shooting
may still be available this season. London agents such as Strutt &amp; Parker or
Egerton can arrange it, taking a 7.5 per cent commission from the tenant. Or
there are small local firms such as Macsport.
The grand alternative to renting by the day or week is to buy a sporting
estate. But few are for sale. It is partly a side-effect of conditions in
the property market this year. Buyers are willing but vendors have held
back. In 1992 prices of the few estates that were sold were at about half
their peaks of the late 1980s, Guy Galbraith of Savills' Edinburgh office,
reports, working out at around Pounds 2,000 a brace of grouse, Pounds
15,000-Pounds 17,000 per stag, and Pounds 8,000 per salmon (based on average
catches over the previous five years).
Prices may have improved slightly this year but the market is still
stagnant. It need not be. Owners and factors (managers) are gloomy,
Galbraith finds, but there is some optimism where it matters - among the
keepers.
Clegg Kennedy Drew offers a driven grouse moor with a cottage at Auchenleck
Hill in Dumfriesshire for Pounds 180,000 (averaging 56.5 brace). If you
prefer pheasant shooting, Brodies is selling Drumlamford at Barrhill in
Ayrshire, an 1830 house with 771 acres in the main lot as well as holiday
cottages, at over Pounds 550,000.
Stenton, near Dunkeld, in Perthshire, is a grander house (agent: Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley). The price of Pounds 1.2m reflects its fishing on the Tay
more than its small family shoot.
Outside Scotland, Plas Llechylched has 72 acres on the Isle of Anglesey with
shooting rights over a further 811 acres for geese, woodcock, snipe and
duck, from Denton Clark and Clegg Kennedy Drew at Pounds 450,000.
In Cornwall, Colquite, near Bodmin, has a pheasant shoot (8,235 birds in
1991-92), plus a shooting lodge, two cottages, barn, land and fishing on the
River Camel. On offer last September at over Pounds 2m, it is now priced at
Pounds 1.65m (Jackson-Stops). To shoot near London, the 196-acre Skeete
estate at Lyminge in Kent could attract at Pounds 550,000 (Egerton). There
is over a year to prepare its small, private shoot for continental guests
emerging from the Channel Tunnel for the 1994-95 season (but leaving their
dogs behind).

FT  14 AUG 93 / Property: If it's good, it sells - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUMMER drought of confidence has inhibited the green shoots of spring.
Buyers are there - determined not to pay over the odds - but vendors are
still hiding in hopes of a better price if they wait.
That is not so certain. And with little sign that Britain will enjoy
political calm in the autumn, house price increases are more likely next
year than this.
David Kern, chief economist at the National Westminster Bank, predicts an
8.5 per cent rise by the end of 1994. That depends on a fluid market, which
has yet to happen. When it does, we may see a flood of instructions, with
the result that buyers will stay in the stronger position and vendors will
not obtain the prices they are waiting for.
In the meantime, good properties sell well. Recently, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
offered Tennyson's Grade I-listed Victorian Gothic Aldworth House near
Haslemere in Surrey at over Pounds 600,000, attracting many visits and more
than 10 possible purchasers.
The agent decided on informal tendering of 'best and final' offers but no
bids 'subject to survey.' Seven bids arrived and contracts were exchanged
within hours at more than Pounds 1m.
Similarly, in London, the Taylor Woodrow/Mitsui Kensetsu development of
apartments, penthouses and town houses at Kensington Green, on the old St
Mary Abbots Hospital site, is selling fast. The latest release is the Walnut
Court block of flats, with a fine view from the penthouse across Kensington.
Inquiries to 071-938 3350.
* * * FOR TRAIN buffs: the British Rail Property Board (021-654 4426) is
offering the Grade II station-master's house at Cromford, in the Derbyshire
Dales, for rent at around Pounds 375 a month. It is a stone, late-19th
century building, with prominent gables and chimneys, that looks as if it
should be in Scotland or France. The only access is by the footbridge over
the line between Matlock and Derby.
In Devon, the old station at East Anstey, on the edge of Exmoor, is on sale
for Pounds 110,000 (from Stags: 0398-23 174), as is Brunel's air pumping
house at Starcross near Exeter: Pounds 85,000 (Fulfords: 0392-52 666). In
1845, the great engineer devised a vacuum pipe system for a railway between
Exeter and Plymouth. It did not work and was given up in 1855, but it is now
thought worth a Grade I listing.
* * * IN WILTSHIRE: Savills (0722-320 422) is selling the most handsome of
Elizabethan houses. Stockton House, also Grade I, is in the Wylye valley
between Salisbury and Warminster, two miles off the A303. John Topp, who
made his money from cloth at the same time as the Spencers of Warwickshire
and Northamptonshire were making theirs from wool, built the house in the
1580s in smart black and white alternating bands of knapped flint and stone.
Its alterations are sympathetic: a 17th century chapel, an 1802 main stairs
by Wyatville, and more rooms and a stable block in the same banded pattern
from the late 19th century. Inside are well-lit rooms with elaborate, carved
stone chimney pieces (one showing the three men of the Old Testament in the
fiery furnace), oak panelling, and superb plaster ceilings and friezes. In
the main room upstairs, a riot of plasterwork parades a bestiary with a
camel, lion, unicorn and elephant with a large insect on its back - an
idealised Elizabethan zoo.
Offers over Pounds 1m are invited. It is a pity that the land with the house
is only 40 acres, as this denies it an economic base within the local
community. But it is a glorious place and would be easy to do over.
* * * PEPER HAROW is a Grade I house with 43.5 acres on the A3 near
Godalming, Surrey, and 35 miles from London. The house is mostly the work of
Chambers in the 18th century (plaster ceilings, marble chimney pieces, and a
Palladian gate to the walled garden), with additions by Cockerell and Pugin
in the 19th.
Restored after a fire in 1989, it was used to house disturbed children until
recently but is more likely now to become a conference centre, nursing home,
hotel or company headquarters. The price for the whole estate is over Pounds
4m, or Pounds 2.25m for the main lot. Joint agents are Lane Fox (071-499
4785) and Savills (071-499 8644).
For something cheaper, around Pounds 50,000 would secure a two-bedroomed
cottage at Tegfan, six miles from Lampeter in mid-Wales. It would suit
twitchers, as you can see the rare red kite there. The agent is Morgan &amp;
Davies (0570-423 623).

<TEXT>
FEW PUBLIC gardens can boast that the pleasure of a visit begins in the car
park. But look in any direction from the hilltop field when you arrive at
Mount Ephraim gardens near Faversham, in Kent. You will find none of the
disfigurements of the late 20th century: just woods, orchards and parkland.
Owned by the Dawes family, which has lived there for 300 years, the gardens
owe their layout to enlargements early this century. Begin by walking down
the daisy-strewn slope beside the rock garden. Once overgrown by nettles and
brambles, the area now has flowering shrubs, dwarf conifers, alpines and
bulbs. A great bank of purple sage and a stone Japanese lantern shades the
first of a series of small pools descending towards a small lake.
At the bottom of the water garden is the Japanese Bridge - a photographer's
dream.
Beyond is a pleasant woodland area of mature trees underplanted with
rhododendrons and azaleas. You emerge into meadows rising towards the house.
A series of formal terraces and a tennis court evoke theatrical incarnations
of the English country manor.
Mount Ephraim offers no permanent attractions for children, apart from acres
of space to run around in. Nor are there any bijou shops stocked with pot
pourri, although you can buy the local wine and there is a small craft
centre in the stable block.
Specialists may find the gardens rather short on botanical labelling, but
you would be hard pressed to find anywhere with such a welcoming and
tranquil atmosphere barely 50 miles from London.
Mount Ephraim Gardens, Hernhill, near Faversham, Kent. Open daily until
end-September 11am to 6pm.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Gardening: Overcome by enemy action - How Robin Lane Fox's
vegetables succumbed to stealthy invaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LITTLE man is always supposed to be the loser and, this summer, I see
why. After a long absence, vegetables have returned to my garden in a new
mood of self-supply. Like all beginnings, it has been a small one: a few
bushes of currants, patterns of salad plants and herbs, a few unusual
desirables, and some of the good old friends which English kitchens have
used for years.
The beginning began two months ago and it ought to be harvested by now.
Unfortunately, the enemy have seen a small man coming and beaten me to my
output. They have savaged, bitten and generally behaved in ways which defy
my university's code of non-harassing conduct. Worse, these harassers are
unwanted guests.
At present, I suspect hedgehogs, because they are the most visible presence,
moving to and fro from the swimming pool to the lower garden. You might
wonder if a hedgehog could ever be so beastly as to eat another person's
young spinach. I think I have evidence of their malice: from time to time
one of their relations turns up, prickles down, in the swimming pool, and I
suspect that it is one of their less popular kin which they have pushed into
the chlorine.
I am pretty sure the squirrels have been involved somehow, possibly because
they have intercepted the latest sound waves from the kitchen. I have
re-discovered a promising recipe for squirrel baked in cider. It sounds
wonderfully cheap, and they are not going to escape by this pre-emptive
strike against my winter greenery. Into the pastry, you can prop a bushy
squirrel tail for decoration, like Squirrel Nutkin's rear view on his raft
across to the island.
Lentil-eating urban visitors believe that foxes are behind the trouble,
financed by well-wishers from a non-hunting co-operative. Recently,
something has started to go to ground beside my retired timber-framed
Morris, but the only sighting by daylight in the area has been a friendly
badger.
Naturally, pigeons are in the vanguard because they can be seen, practising
spot landing in the purple sprouting. One of the garden's functions is to
serve as a safe haven for refugees under gunfire from the nearby estates.
Pheasants may have roughed up the courgettes but I have yet to see French
partridges among the haricots verts.
The possible enemies are, simply, too many to control. The Guides to Green
Gardening know best, as always, and one of them has told me to solve the
problem by putting out saucers of milk at nightfall because the visitors
will surely prefer milk to mixed greens. Actually, they prefer cabbage au
lait.
I suppose I could start shooting, and I would like to know if the back legs
of a grey squirrel can be punctured by pellets from an air gun. Meanwhile, I
have a protest and a helpful observation.
The protest is a small man's lament. Why do birds eat gardener's fruits,
slugs eat their young cauliflowers and rabbits polish off the transplants
whereas you can see whole fields of raspberries all over Kent with no nets
in sight, covered in fruit and open for picking your own? Slugs never bother
big fields of kale and you never see snail holes in those gleaming fields of
cabbage on the dark earth round Biggleswade.
Faced with abundance, animal pests behave like humans and go for smallness,
not because small is beautiful but because they must be absolute swine at
heart. They are much less of a bother in big kitchen gardens.
One reason might be that they, too, are brought up on the story of Peter
Rabbit and are scared of Mr MacGregor's cat: my view, simply, is that pests
pick on the small man because they feel at ease with the scale.
There could, however, be a way out which, in turn, might be exacerbating the
problem. When last I grew vegetables, early in the 1970s, people were
telling us to store turnips against the imminent takeover by the Trades
Union Congress; brassicas were thought to be a safer investment than Glaxo
in the gloom of the three-day week; and financial advisers were even more
vegetable than usual.
Since the 1970s, the vegetable portfolio has changed. In the 1990s, everyone
wants basil, not beetroot; pak choi, not parsnips; and Raymond Blanc now
spells rocket with a q. Supermarkets will sell almost anything exotic at any
time of year, but few of them stock asparagus peas. And if you want your own
roquette, you have to look in the Vegetable Finder and send away for seed.
Taste and defence, I now notice, are coinciding. Birds eat the small man's
cherries and slugs spoil his spring cabbage but, so far, the sorrel for his
designer soup is more or less safe. I have concluded that animal harassers
do not like designer vegetables: whoever saw a rabbit eating okra in the
wild?
On a kinder view, human fashion could explain my predicament. Frustrated by
all that basil in the suburbs, the vissiting harassers can hardly have been
expected to behave themselves when a small man returned to production,
growing old-fashioned lettuces in country lines. After all that Lollo Rosso
in north Oxford, can I really blame them if they go straight for a good old
English salad and beat me to the first of my Little Gem?

FT  14 AUG 93 / Travel: Bathing in five-coloured hot waters - Lesley Downer
visits Japan's most fashionable resort, cycles past lava beds and watches a
prince and princess play tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLEY DOWNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN before I arrived, I knew that Prince Akishino and his doe-eyed bride,
Princess Kiko, were in Karuizawa. Somehow everyone knew - though quite how
word had got round I don't know. I also knew that they were staying not in
their usual summer residence but in the Mampei Hotel.
Once I was settled in I hired a bicycle and began to explore the back
streets, until I was stopped by a mass of people. Peering over the sea of
heads I saw the wire netting of the tennis courts, the red-roofed mock-Tudor
changing-rooms, and the familiar figures of the prince and princess, lobbing
a ball back and forth.
Karuizawa was the scene for the great Japanese fairytale romance of all
time. It happened in 1957. Akishino's father, the then crown prince,
Akihito, had had a rather lonely boyhood, being groomed to take over the
solitary post of emperor. In those days the imperial family was even further
removed from the public than it is now.
Most people had never even seen the emperor's face. If he chanced to pass
by, you had to bow to the ground and not look up until he was gone.
After the war, young Akihito was assigned an American tutor, a Quaker called
Mrs Vining. In the summer she used to retire to the hill station of
Karuizawa, where she had a villa, and Akihito, too, became fond of the
place.
It was here in 1957 that he found himself playing tennis opposite Michiko
Koda, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy industrialist. When they married,
most Japanese saw it as the seal on their new-found democracy; no emperor
had ever dreamt of marrying a commoner before.
I went to Karuizawa last August, along, it seemed, with half of Tokyo. Due,
no doubt, to its imperial associations, it is now Japan's most fashionable
resort. When Tokyo is unbearably hot and steamy, Karuizawa is blissfully
cool, and many Tokyoites have second homes there, designer villas hidden
away in the larch woods around the town.
The train that day was completely packed. I was sharing the compartment with
a group of ladies on their way to a 'spiritual seminar' on the teachings of
Rabinadrath Tagore. We trundled across the plains, laid out with neat paddy
fields and little square houses, then climbed steeply up into the rugged
landscape around Usui Pass.
Dark wooded crags, which looked as if they had been brushed on to an ink
painting, soared around us, mist drifting in the hollows. We plunged into a
long tunnel and finally came out into the uplands of Karuizawa.
Karuizawa sits right at the foot of Mount Asama, said to be the highest
active volcano in Japan. In summer it is often hidden by clouds, but then
the weather clears and you suddenly see it, looming over the town, a plume
of smoke floating ominously above it. A little way out of town are lava
beds, relics of the last great eruption of 1783, which engulfed several
towns and villages and left the area scattered with grotesquely-shaped giant
lava boulders.
Besides Mt Asama, Karuizawa is noted for its larch woods and for the many
artists and writers who go to live there. It is a pleasant, breezy place,
with long avenues skirting woods, lakes and hillocks - until, that is, you
cycle into the centre of town and suddenly find yourself in a mini-Tokyo:
coffee shops, clothes shops, jewellery shops, crowds, restaurants, noise,
canned music and traffic jams, bursting out like some dreadful growth right
in the middle of these peaceful hills. Cycling is the only sane way to get
around.
I gave Karuizawa a couple of days, hiding out, like the prince and princess,
in the gracious Mampei Hotel. It opened 99 years ago, in the days when
westerners could still afford to come to Japan for an inexpensive holiday,
and boasts cherrywood panelling, carved ceilings, stained-glass windows and
passable French food.
I did not find any French food in Nagano. It is an hour further up the line
from Karuizawa, but more like several decades away from the sophistication
and glittering lights of Tokyo.
No one comes here for 'spiritual seminars', and I very much doubt that the
emperor has a summer villa here. To most Japanese, Nagano equals mountains.
It is a small city at the heart of mountain country, full of climbers and
golfers in the summer and skiers in the winter, en route to the spectacular
peaks which soar not far away.
Nagano is on the brink of great changes. It is to be the site of the winter
Olympics in 1998, and already many building projects are under way. There
will be grand new hotels with restaurants, banqueting halls and nightclubs.
The citizens want to put Nagano on the map and are looking forward to the
coming of 'internationalisation', in the form of an influx of western
visitors.
For now, though, it remains a city of shadows. I arrived early on a Saturday
evening, when most Japanese towns are just coming alive, and discovered that
Nagano had already gone to bed. Around the station there were still some
lights, with people gathered like moths around a candle. But outside of that
charmed area the city had shut down.
A mile-long mall of dark shuttered shops led straight up the hill to a
temple gate the size of a small house, where two muscular guardian deities
like huge goblins glowered in the blackness. Beyond that was a cobbled
street straight out of a Hiroshige print, lined with ricketty wooden houses.
Occupying the entire summit of the hill was Zenkoji Temple, vast and dark
with lanterns and candles glimmering inside, vases of flowers and ancient
images rubbed smooth from the hands of the faithful. It is one of the area's
most famous pilgrimage places, and is already preparing for the expected
influx of visitors in 1998. While most temples sell good luck charms from
little stalls, at Zenkoji you buy them day or night from a vending machine.
Goshiki-no-yu was darker still. From Nagano I took a local train out to the
foot of the hills, then changed to a bus which careered along narrow unlit
roads, zigzagging up the mountainside until we came to a single lonely
house, halfway up.
The master of the house came out to greet me. Mr Mizuno is 73 and has kept
the inn there ever since he got back from the war, nearly 50 years ago, in
the days when the only lighting was from oil lamps. He shepherded me to my
room, made sure I was well provided with bedding, and instructed me in the
intricacies of the bath. The gentlemen guests, he informed me, had already
bathed, so I would be able to bath in privacy.
In Japan it would be unthinkable to go on holiday for a few days without
taking the waters. The glory of Goshiki-no-yu is that the baths are
outdoors, and the water is said to change colour depending on the weather
(go-shiki no yu means 'five-colour hot water').
You leave your dressing-gown in a small changing shed, then, with nothing
but a handkerchief-sized towel to preserve modesty, stumble out into the
night. Ghostly swirls of steam rose from the pools and streams and there was
a nose-wrinkling rotten-egg smell of sulphur.
I dipped my toe into the murky depths to test the temperature, then eased in
and sat back with a sigh of bliss in the steaming water. I was all alone in
the darkness, with just the stars and moon, scudding clouds, the silhouette
of the hillside against the night sky and the lights of the inn flickering
behind me.
Inside, a gourmet dinner was awaiting me: tiny river crabs, the size of a
10p piece, deep-fried whole, legs and all; an assortment of leaves fried in
tempura batter, and various wild plants. While I ate, Mr Mizuno settled down
to tell me his stories.
In the daylight Goshiki-no-yu was less magical. The mystical coloured water
turned out to be black - so black that you couldn't see your own body in it.
This was no doubt on account of the weather, and I remain convinced that it
is truly go-shiki: on other days it is undoubtedly green, blue, grey or even
purple.
Mr Mizuno had asked me to write a poem to commemorate my visit, an offer
which cannot be refused in Japan. After much head-scratching, this is what I
came up with:
Life by lamplight
Seventy-three years of memories
Goshiki-no-yu
Japan Air Lines (JAL), British Airways, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Virgin
all fly non-stop between London and Tokyo. The standard return Pex fare is a
little over Pounds 1,000; bucket shop tickets start at about Pounds 550 for
Aeroflot.
Before you leave, buy a Japan Rail Pass, which allows you to use all the JR
trains, including the Shinkansen (Bullet Train). A week's pass costs about
Pounds 150. There are also two- and three-week passes. Available from JAL or
the Japan Travel Bureau (JTB), 14 Maltravers St, London W1, 071-836-9393;
not available in Japan.
Getting around: a railway timetable costs Pounds 2 from any station kiosk;
ask for jikokuhyo. It can be deciphered with a little effort and will prove
invaluable.
Accommodation: as Japan's premier resort, Karuizawa is not cheap. The
grandest hotel in town is the Mampei (0267-42-1234; twin rooms from about
Pounds 125 per night). Those in search of budget accommodation should go one
stop up the line to Naka-Karuizawa, where there are some cheaper inns; for
details, ask the Japan National Tourist Organisation (see below).
In Nagano, the Ikemon (0262-27-2122), opposite the station, has cosy rooms
for about Pounds 32 per night. At Goshiki-no-yu there is only one inn:
Goshiki-no-yu ryokan (0262-42- 2500; about Pounds 85 per head, including
dinner and breakfast. If pressed, Mr Mizuno's son can speak some English.
Both in Japan and elsewhere, the Japan National Tourist Organisation (JNTO)
is an invaluable source of information and supplies excellent (free) city
maps. In London: 167 Regent Street, London W1R 7FD (071-734-9638/9). In
Japan look for the Tourist Information Centres, (TIC), run by the JNT0, at
Narita Airport and in Tokyo and Kyoto.
The fall in the pound and other currencies against the yen has hit
travellers to Japan severely. As a result, the guide prices quoted above may
lack precision.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Sport: Weighed down by August - Cricket / Surprising leaders
and laggards in the race for the county championship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With August comes full yield
Then cricket wears a
mantle overgrown,
And counties in the field
lose gloss
As though they wished the
season flown.
THE FIRST verse of G D Martineau's memorably dreadful poem, Cricketer's
August (1935), reminds us how hard this month can be in cricket, calling for
endurance it does not always find.
Lancashire's talented players, for instance, suffer from mid-season periods
of depression. Last year, they lost their gloss so early that they did not
win a single match between mid-May and early August, after which the best
they could do was finish eighth in the county championship.
This season, Lancashire's mid-season depression has been so bad that they
provided Gloucestershire with their only championship win this season - last
weekend, at Cheltenham, by nine wickets.
Nor is it just Lancashire who are feeling the strain. Before the season
began, few people were expecting an August championship table with Middlesex
(11th last year) in first place, Glamorgan (14th last year) in second and
Essex (last year's champions) reckoning it a revival to have pulled
themselves up to ninth.
Mind you, I can claim that I had my doubts about Essex, with batting stars
Graham Gooch and Australia's Mark Waugh due to be soaked up by Test duty and
bowler Neil Foster tormented by recurrent knee and spine injuries. Although
this was Foster's benefit season, he had to retire from first-class cricket
after a brave but troubled series of games, and is missed greatly.
The fiery genius of Pakistan's Salim Malik has not worked the overseas
oracle for Essex this year and, as so often, bad luck seems to breed bad
cricket. Essex were one of the few counties loath to change from the
three-day to the four-day format because, among other things, it would
lessen the number of matches they could play on outlying grounds with
enterprising pitches.
It is always sad when counties centralise their cricket and, this season,
Essex have only one championship game each at Ilford, Colchester and
Southend, half as many as last year. Chelmsford is increasingly dominant.
Habit is a strong force in cricket, and the hard truth is that Essex are not
in the habit of losing and are not sure how best to react when they do. The
other side of that, of course, is that Essex are in the habit of persisting.
Where Lancashire are inclined to brood, Essex are inclined to fight, and I
would not be surprised to see them fight better before the season ends.
It will be hard, however, for anyone to challenge Middlesex's commanding
lead, which is based not so much on batting or bowling points - Surrey, in
third place, have more of both - but on the fact that they have had nine
victories (Surrey have only six) and, most tellingly, are the only team not
to have lost a single game so far this summer.
Mike Gatting led Middlesex to victory in 1990 and is determined to avenge
recent championship misfortunes with another triumph this year. He thinks
his team are capable of winning and is proud that his captaincy is of the
'tough guy,' rather than the tactical or fitness-and-exercise, schools.
Gatting is popular with a temperamental Middlesex team which includes two
stars as famous for their tantrums as their talent: Phil Tufnell and Mark
Ramprakash. Tufnell and John Emburey have been a profitable partnership of
spin for Middlesex this year.
Last season the whole fast bowling force - Ricky Ellcock, Norman Cowans and
Angus Fraser - was injured and, not to be upstaged, Tufnell started the
summer with appendicitis. So long as Gatting does not overwork Fraser's
damaged hip, he might be able to revive him - along with Neil Williams, Mark
Feltham and the young Richard Johnson - as part of a fair-paced bowling
attack to work alongside the spinners.
As for batting, Desmond Haynes, Mike Roseberry, Gatting himself and
Ramprakash are a formidable quartet, although Middlesex are always prone to
injury. John Carr has had an unexpectedly good season and has done well in
the field, where Ramprakash has also fielded like a harrier picking up prey.
Middlesex's favourite victim was Surrey, its old enemy from south of the
Thames, at Lord's late in June - sweet revenge for last year when Surrey
moved from 11th to seventh in the championship, and sent Middlesex from
seventh to 11th, in the last game of the season. Then, their last wicket
pair resisted Tufnell's last two balls and hung on a for a draw at the
Foster's Oval. Middlesex are an urban crew; the nearest they can offer to an
outlying county ground is Uxbridge, an outpost of the north-west London
Underground.
Still smarting from that defeat, Surrey are in their customary position of
not quite doing themselves justice; but Northampton, fourth at the moment
with a game in hand, are experts in doing just the opposite. The late middle
stretch of the season, when other counties are getting stale, suits
Northants.
They are a balanced team and manage to maintain their concentration through
bad patches, aided by Allan Lamb's calmer captaincy. Northampton did not
drop Lamb when his first years in office were undistinguished, and his
captaincy now does much better for his team.
The real surprise is Glamorgan, in second place. Leaving the good sense to
Northampton, the Welsh-based club have been living off high spirits. They
were 100-1 outsiders at the end of last year but have won seven of their
games this season, drawing attention to their home-grown players, such as
the Rhondda valley's paragon of the fast-medium, Steve Watkin.
Skipper Hugh Morris is a good example of how much confidence can help a
troubled player. In 1989, the captaincy proved too much and he resigned, his
game in tatters. This year, he cannot get enough of it and is not worried by
his slightly erratic batting.
Wherever Glamorgan end up, Morris will regard it as a success. Or a
refutation of critics. Or a point proved. Or, at the very least, a point of
passion - like Glamorgan's defeat of the visiting Australians a quarter of a
century ago, against all odds, at Cardiff. As the great Martineau put it,
deep in his second verse:
Spring still is in their blood
And bids them throng to watch heroic things.

WITH THE world athletics championships starting today in Stuttgart there
must be a suspicion that, whatever the television commentators tell us, we
are probably being served something less than haute cuisine.
Already attractive items have been scrubbed from the menu: some athletes are
simply giving the championships a miss. The Kenyan Yobes Ondieki, who broke
the 10,000m world record earlier this year, says he does not want to run a
championship this year and nor does his wife Lisa, the Australian marathon
runner.
Noureddine Morceli, the Algerian 1,500m world record holder, has said he
will not compete because there is no prize money and no glory, though there
is still a chance that pressure from his national federation and the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's governing body, will
get him to the start line. Rumours persist that a select few athletes are
being paid to appear at Stuttgart, but of those who are competing and will
be given star billing, several are not at their best.
International championships were once rare contests. This is only the fourth
world championships. The first three were four years apart, but Stuttgart
follows just two years after Tokyo. In the three years 1991-93 we will have
had two world championships and an Olympic Games. Next year it is the
European championships and Commonwealth games.
The frequency of big championships gives athletes no respite in their
training and competitive cycle, but it is attractive to television.
The European Broadcasting Union paid the IAAF Dollars 8m for European
broadcasting rights to events staged between 1987 and 1991. For events
between 1992 and 1995, of which the Stuttgart championships is the first of
significance, the EBU is paying Dollars 91m.
Thanks to television and its money, athletics gives the appearance of being
a rich sport. But at various levels there are disputes as to how the cash is
distributed.
In Britain, the British Athletics Federation has been accused by one of its
own management board members of prostituting itself in staging the Pounds
200,000 100m showdown between Linford Christie and Carl Lewis at Gateshead.
How, asked Derek Johnson, could British athletics lobby effectively for
money from the government or the Sports Council if it was seen handling the
kind of money spent on the Christie-Lewis show?
At what were once known as the grass-roots of British athletics (before the
advent of the all-weather track), there is little sign of the sport's
new-found wealth.
Impoverished local authorities are struggling to keep tracks open and fit
for competition. The athletics clubs are finding it hard to meet the cost of
transporting teams to and from competitions.
In the international arena, athletes have been voicing discontent over
whether they are getting a fair share of the sport's revenue. Tom Jennings,
a representative on the US track and field council, predicts a showdown with
the the IAAF.
'All it would take is one good boycott (by athletes),' he says. On the eve
of the world championships, the IAAF's congress met this week in Stuttgart.
Its most depressing decision was to move the IAAF's headquarters from London
to Monte Carlo. This amounts to a further concentration of power in the
It is hard to see how IAAF finances will be made more accountable by a move
to Monte Carlo, where Nebiolo has already established the International
Athletics Foundation, an off-shoot of the IAAF, over which he has even
tighter control. Although the IAAF's multi-million dollar balances are
supposed to be devoted to good works, their most visible use is in paying
for a lavish gala at the end of each season.
Arguably, there should be a publicly-agreed structure to pass revenue down
from the IAAF to member federations. In practice, IAAF funds are spent as
Nebiolo and his council permit, and the supposedly non-profit-making body is
accumulating hefty financial reserves.
The IAAF's published spending plans for 1992-95 show that of a total budget
of Dollars 172.3m, Dollars 16m has been allocated to meetings - not
athletics events but the gatherings of Dr Nebiolo and his committees in
various parts of the world. That sum is not so far short of the Dollars 21m
allocated for the development of the sport internationally, and far in
excess of the Dollars 1.9m to be spent on combating the sport's drug users.
The IAAF congress has rejected a proposal to make sentencing more lenient
for those failing drugs tests. There has been a steady stream of athletes
found using drugs - most recently Tatyana Doroviskikh, winner of three world
championship gold medals. The drug-testing techniques and punishments are
already insufficient deterrent when set against the financial rewards which
athletics success can now bring.
Canadian hurdler Mark McKoy is one of those athletes who have been convicted
of drug-taking but have since been rehabilitated. Last year he won the
Olympic gold medal in the 110m hurdles. This year he misses the Stuttgart
championships because he fell out with his national federation and was not
selected.
In commercial terms, he may be fortunate. The shine of his Olympic medal
cannot now be tarnished by defeat at Stuttgart, and later in the season
there can be a handsomely-paid run-off between him and the new world
champion.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Sport: Crewman courageous - Yachting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BEFORE each Admiral's Cup, arguments are advanced that the 605-mile Fastnet
Race has no place in what has become a series of inshore races for yachts
more like giant dinghies than blue-water vessels. Yet the three-day classic
always furnishes excitement and drama that no afternoon dash round the buoys
could provide.
This year was no exception. The most gripping racing was between three
50-footers: Indulgence (UK), Ragamuffin (Australia) and Corum Saphir
(France). They raced the entire course virtually within hailing distance of
one another and finished in the above order with only 23 seconds between
first place to third.
'This has to be the closest yacht-racing available in the world,' said
Indulgence owner Graham Walker as the crew celebrated under television
lights at the Plymouth finish line. It was a boat packed with experience.
During long nights sitting out on the weather rail, the Indulgence team
calculated they had 67 Fastnets between them.
Before leaving Cowes last Saturday, Peter Gilmour (skipper of Ragamuffin)
had said: 'If we're a scoring boat then it's all over', referring to
Australia's excellent chance of winning the Admiral's Cup for the first
time.
What threw the calculations out was not Ragamuffin's storming second place,
but the dismasting of the Aussie two-tonner Great News II. She was leading
the mid-size fleet, homeward-bound 44 miles north-west of Land's End in
rough weather, when the mast snapped at deck level.
Twenty minutes' work with bolt-cutters saw the slender - and expensive  -
spar on its way to the sea bed. Meanwhile, close by in time and distance, an
identical mishap befell the Italian two-tonner Larouge. She had been lying
just behind Great News II.
This was a calamity for the Italians. In spite of going into the Fastnet
with a two-point series lead over Australia, they had only two boats.
Mandrake, Italy's 50-footer, had been written-off in a horrendous collision
with Promotion of the Netherlands during an earlier race.
Since the Admiral's Cup 1993 scores points from only the best two yachts,
the elimination of Larouge meant that, as in 1991, the well-prepared and
talented Italian AC team were once more the bridesmaids, not the bride.
Victory in the end fell to the Germans.
Leaving Cowes three days earlier, Harold Cudmore, the Irish team captain,
had warned commentators not to dismiss the Germans' chances. 'They've heavy
seaworthy boats, not very fast, but competently sailed. If everyone else
blows up they could come through,' he warned. Earlier in the regatta he had
sunk his own team's one-tonner, Jameson I, by cutting a Solent corner and
ramming the rocks at Gurnard Ledge.
Germany's eventual victory over Australia was by the narrowest margin in AC
history - a quarter of a point. The key was the storming performance of
their smallest boat, Pinta. Not only did she come in over two hours ahead of
the nearest one-tonner but on corrected time was seventh in the fleet
overall, ahead of much bigger boats.
The denouement did not come until the final miles of the Fastnet, creeping
eastwards under the Cornish cliff towards Plymouth. To protect Australia's
almost certain team win, their one-tonner Ninja had to finish not more than
six places behind Pinta. She missed by one place.
But the most compelling drama of the Fastnet concerned a man-overboard from
the Japanese one-tonner Nippon. Bowman Kazuhiko Sofuku was swept off the
deck at night in rough weather. He had no life jacket but was clutching a
torch.
'At first we could see the light,' said Nippon's British skipper, Andrew
Hurst. 'But when the torch went out I began to feel sick.' In broken water
and complete darkness the small yacht began a search pattern. Some of the
time they could hear cries from the lost crewman, but could not see him.
One of the biggest problems was the noise from the engine - necessary for an
effective search but drowning the shouts of the man overboard. Hurst knew
the boat's exact position at the time of the incident from the GPS
navigation system, but in such conditions even someone only 200 yards away
can be nearly impossible to locate.
'After about 15 minutes we were all becoming very worried and quiet,' said
Hurst. 'We'd been launching parachute flares to illuminate the area and I
was beginning to worry if we'd drifted off our search area. The last flare
was 6ft from landing in the water when we saw Kazuhiko. He was looking very
weak and going under water rather too often.'
With the crewman restored to his bunk and being treated for potential
hypothermia, one of the most fortunate sailors and yachts to compete in any
Fastnet headed back to Plymouth.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Motoring: Saab, solid and spirited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
WHEN General Motors rode to Saab's financial rescue, some enthusiasts feared
the worst. Future Saabs, they thought, would be Opels or Vauxhalls in
disguise. They can set their minds at rest.
The new Saab 900 might have been built on a modified GM platform (the modern
equivalent of a chassis), and one version has the British-made V6 engine
that powers up-market Vauxhall Cavaliers. But the 900 looks, feels and goes
like a proper Saab - because it is. At the moment, there is only one body: a
five-door hatchback. And while officially-leaked photographs had made the
new 900 look remarkably like an old one with the corners rounded off, in the
metal it has an altogether sleeker, more elegant shape. There are no
overtones of the old 99 from which the original 900 was evolved in 1978, and
which could still be seen. Three-door hatchbacks and a convertible will
follow in the first half of next year.
Although mainland European sales start later this month, the new 900 will
not make its British debut until the London Motor Show, which opens on
October 21. Prices will be announced shortly before.
Saab says that, in left-hand drive markets, the new 900 will be only 1 or 2
per cent dearer than the old one. The company claims that when equipment
levels are taken into consideration as well, it will be up to 14 per cent
cheaper than potential rivals such as the Audi 80, BMW 3-Series and
Mercedes-Benz C-Class. An inspired guess puts the cheapest two-litre 900 at
around Pounds 14,750.
Engines are a two-litre, 133 brake horsepower; 2.3-litre, 150 bhp; and a
turbo-charged two-litre (available next spring) developing 185 bhp. All are
multi-valved; the 2.3-litre and two-litre turbo have twin balance shafts.
The 2.5-litre V6, which Saab engineers tailored to meet their requirements,
puts out 170 bhp.
A Saab-developed five-speed gearbox is standard, while a four-speed
automatic with normal, sports and winter driving modes is an optional extra.
The manual-only 900 turbo will be offered with a newly-developed Saab
Sensonic automatic clutch system. You change gear normally but electronic
controls operate the clutch for starting and shifting.
Once you get the knack, it works well. The price premium will probably be
about half that for a conventional torque converter type of automatic. Fuel
consumption will be at least as good as that of a manual transmission car.
I tried two Sensonic-equipped turbo 900s in Sweden last week, with a
two-pedal V6 in between. Sensonic is fussy about which gear you select.
Unlike some earlier kinds of semi-automatic (like that of the Wankel-engined
NSU Ro80 of 25 years ago), it cannot be left in, say, third gear while you
creep along in a motorway tailback. It insists you pick first or second. I
liked it well enough as a half-way house but suspect most business drivers
will choose fully-automatic transmission in a non-turbo four-cylinder or a
V6 (it will not be available in the turbo).
Putting Sensonic in the 900 Turbo is really testing the market. But Saab
engineers see more potential in systems like it, perhaps with gear-shifting
controlled by buttons on the steering wheel, than in torque converter
automatics. If a lot of Turbo buyers go for Sensonic, it could eventually be
offered on other 900s.
While retaining Saab's traditional sporty feel, the new 900s are, above all,
refined and smooth-riding performers. The entry model two-litre and the
2.3-litre version were ultra-quiet on smooth-surfaced roads, and tyre noise
was minimal on rough-textured ones.
As always, the extra cornering grip of the squatter, wider tyres of the
higher performers has a trade-off; more noise on coarse surfaces and the odd
thump caused by potholes.
Sweden's draconian speed limits, and a generally adult attitude toward cars,
discourage fast driving. So, having tasted rather than tested the new range,
my main impression is of rock-solid construction matched by spirited
handling and courtly manners on occasionally rain-swept roads.
All 900s have driver-side air bags, ABS brakes and power steering; buyers in
this class now expect nothing less. Other features are a 'black panel'
switch which lets a driver choose a speedometer-only display for night
driving, and full lap/diagonal seatbelts for all five occupants.
Traditionalists will be pleased to know that the ignition switch is still on
the floor near the gear lever, which is locked in reverse when the key is
withdrawn.
Saab never will be a big player in the executive car market because, in
world terms, it is a small producer, making fewer than 100,000 units a year.
In a full year, about 45,000 of these will be 900s, the rest 9000s. Saab
expects some substitution from 9000 owners but the bigger car will still
take 45 per cent of its business.
There will not be a 900 estate car and a diesel-engined version is some
years off. 'We are aware of the surge in diesel sales but we can't do
everything at once,' said product development director Sig-Gran Larsson.
'When we do offer a diesel Saab - and we are looking at various engines -
you can be sure it will a Saab first, a diesel second.'
BMW followed the same policy of allowing no compromises in refinement and
performance when making diesel cars. The result is that 25 per cent of all
BMW 5-Series cars are now the smoothest and most vigorous turbo-diesels on
the market.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYBODY WHO has been to Zimbabwe will remember the rows of crocheted cushion
covers and bedspreads spread out in all the places where tourists gather.
Crochet work is endemic, but the quality varies from the crude and
inexpertly executed to the extremely finely wrought.
Geraldine Jackson, who comes from that part of the world, has brought to the
UK a selection of very fine quality crocheted linens. All are made by hand -
which means that no measurements or designs are identical - and all use 100
per cent four-ply ecru cotton yarn. They are made by groups of Zimbabwean
women gathered together by a local farmer's wife, who was distraught at the
hardship caused by the drought of the last few years and who felt that truly
beautiful work ought to have a ready market overseas. She insists on the
highest standards and the work I have seen is very fine.
Prices seem extraordinarily reasonable, given the skilled handwork. A
queen-sized bedspread in the 'Bubble' (Mapuda) design, 100 in by 100 in, is
Pounds 103.50. King size, 100 in by 125 in is Pounds 120 and 21 in by 15 in
cushion covers are Pounds 11.75.
Geraldine Jackson is preparing a full-colour catalogue of all the designs
which should be ready in a couple of weeks. She has a cache of bedspreads
arriving shortly but some designs may have to be made to order, which will
means a wait of a few weeks. All are available from Geraldine Jackson, Pink
Flamingo, 4 Cheyne Row, Thorncombe Street, Bramley, Surrey, GU 50 LU.

FT  14 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Dino II fits the bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAY BACK in 1963, when Aram Designs was about the only place in England
where you could find truly contemporary furniture and when the very first
Habitat was thrilling its new customers in London's Fulham Road, Zeev Aram
designed a multi-purpose storage system called Dino.
Those were the days when flexible storage systems were concentrating the
minds of many of the design gurus of the day. Most of the systems that
emerged were too clever by half. So multifarious were the options, so
infinite the possibilities, that most of us gave up working out the
permutations, waved a hand at something simpler and said 'We'll take that.'
Dino, though, was different. True, it needed a greater mind than mine to
cope with all the measuring-up and fiddling about, but its essence was
engagingly simple. A system of beechwood uprights set 3 ft apart with
grooves cut at 3 in intervals along both sides formed the framework. Into
the grooves could be fitted four sizes of storage boxes and drawers, four
sizes of cupboard doors, writing tables, bunk beds and kitchen units. It
could be used in the kitchen, study, sitting-room, bathroom, bedroom . . .
almost anywhere.
And on top of all that, it looked very attractive, too.
Its attractiveness became part of the problem. The range was so wide that
the manufacturers found it impossible to cope with the range of products and
when Aram Designs moved from its Kings Road site to Covent Garden, the
system was discontinued.
However, round about the time that Dino was launched a small boy called
Jasper Morrison was born who grew up to be a designer. He had been aware of
Dino most of his life. 'It was,' he says, 'a design far ahead of its time. I
always loved it but felt it could be made simpler to make it more
accessible.'
Twenty years after it was discontinued Jasper Morrison suggested to Zeev
Aram that Dino be re-edited, updated and re-introduced. Dino Mark II,
pictured below left, is the result. The look has been retained - uprights
with grooves to take the shelves are its essence - but it has been greatly
simplified. It is now primarily a shelving system (no bunk beds, cupboards,
kitchen cabinets and the rest) with two different heights: 1100 mm and 2060
mm. The width from centre to centre is 900 mm, the depth 330 mm. There are
also storage boxes in two depths which also fit into the uprights. Height
and width can be altered by simply cutting the uprights or the shelves to
the size required. The shelving could therefore usefully be used in a room
with a sloping ceiling, with each upright cut to fit.
The uprights and shelving are made of MDF (a new improved and strengthened
medium density fibreboard) while the tray and drawers are in solid beech.
Whereas the old system had to be clipped to the wall Jasper Morrison has
made the new one free-standing using aluminium bracing to stabilise it.
Though the system is officially easy to assemble with the help of a
screwdriver, those for whom the letters 'DIY' strike terror into the heart
can take advantage of Aram Designs' installation service.
The design is just as pleasing to look at after all these years. The
distinctive crenallated edges are still there but the overwhelming
impression is of shelving that is simple but not stark. Warm, useful and,
above all, flexible, it is the sort of storage that almost every house could
do with.
Tall uprights are Pounds 76 each, low ones Pounds 46, base shelves, Pounds
15, single shallow drawers are Pounds 54 in solid beech, Pounds 33 in MDF,
single deep drawers are Pounds 66 in solid beech and Pounds 45 in MDF.
The system is on display at Aram Designs at 3 Kean Street, Covent Garden,
London WC2B 4AT and 65 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3. Aram Designs
also has an explanatory leaflet which it will send on request.

FT  14 AUG 93 / How to Spend It: At last, the no-knife face-lift - Until now
women who hoped for a younger face had to be rich - and brave. Surgery was
the only option. Lucia van der Post looks at a British invention, the
non-surgical face-lift - painless, more affordable and non-invasive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE of you who are accustomed to seeing nothing but the professionally
perfect faces of full-time models on the page may wonder what somebody
normal, somebody much more like you and me, is doing here. She is Alice
West, who has bravely agreed to show her own warm, lived-in, unmade-up face
as it was before (on the left) and after (on the right) she embarked on a
course of treatments that purport to do, non-surgically, for the face what a
cosmetic surgeon does with the knife. Here, say its proponents, is the first
real alternative to surgery, the first non-surgical face-lift.
To most of us, rendered sceptical by the frequent and often conflicting
claims of the cosmetic industry, this sounds rather too good to be true.
Creams come and go, machines come and go, but lines, wrinkles, sagging and
all the other ills that flesh is heir to tend to survive them all.
To be fair, the literature put out by the team behind Perfector (the
treatment that Alice West was given) does not talk of miracles. Rather it
says it offers 'a completely relaxing, natural way to delay the ageing
process.' Or 'a uniquely holistic face lift, toning and tightening the
underlying muscles and therefore the skin.'
So what exactly is Perfector? It is a smallish machine, not much bigger than
an office computer. The treatment is based on sending micro-current impulses
through the skin to the underlying muscle and tissue, where it speeds up
circulation of the blood and lymph, leaving the skin better-toned and
firmer. An extremely low voltage is applied via two hand-held cotton-tipped
electrodes which are guided by the (trained) operator to stimulate the areas
being treated.
Micro-current techniques have been used for some time in the medical world,
particularly in the rehabilitation of stroke patients, but are only just
beginning to be used in the beauty world.
The good news is that the treatment is entirely non-invasive and, at between
Pounds 360 and Pounds 540 for the full works, it is also a lot cheaper than
a full-scale surgical face-lift.
I had one hour's treatment and it was as restful and peaceful as having a
facial or a massage anywhere else. I certainly had the impression that I
looked fresher, better-slept, more rested after it and - probably more to
the point - so did my exceedingly sceptical husband.
For the full effect to be seen, the whole 'face-lift' to be perfected, a
course of two one-hour treatments a week for six weeks is recommended. After
that a top-up once a month or so should help keep the damage at bay.
Heather Kirby is a journalist who says she went along full of worldly
cynicism ('Oh, yes, pull the other one,' she thought) but stayed to have the
full course and is very impressed.
'First they did half my face. Then they showed me a mirror and I could see a
difference, so I begged them to get on with the other half. Most of my
friends say 'goodness, you look good, what have you done?' When I say I've
had a face-lift their mouths drop open. My sister was so impressed that she
insisted on taking me out into the garden to see me in the light. She was
still impressed. I think it is a brilliant half-way house between doing
nothing and surgery. It is very relaxing, it doesn't hurt and above all that
Mrs Thatcher hound-dog look that I had when I woke up in the morning has
gone.'
Stella Mansfield, a 48-year-old divorcee, has also tried the treatments. 'I
go regularly to the B Beautiful Salon in Romford in Essex for leg waxing.
One day Nuala Briggs, who owns it, suggested that I try the treatment. I
have never got on well with facials because I don't have blackheads or open
pores but after one go with Perfector I wanted to have the full set of
treatments. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing but all my friends
started saying that I looked so well - they said my skin glowed so much I
must be having an affair]'
Though Perfector is primarily used on the face it is said to do wonders for
stretch-marks and flabby muscles elsewhere. The treatments cost between
Pounds 30 and Pounds 45 a session, depending on salon. For details of the
nearest salon offering the treatments ring 0628-532007.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Fashion: The closet life of a well-dressed doctor - Liz
Walker meets a doctor who enjoys clothing his partner

DAVID BARLOW is a consultant in genito-urinary medicine at St. Thomas's
Hospital in London and a member of Instant Sunshine, a band of singing
doctors taking part in the Edinburgh Festival at the Pleasance Theatre. His
wife Angela teaches the Alexander Technique, a method of adjusting the
posture aimed at reducing stress, improving breathing and promoting a
general sense of well-being, in Dulwich and central London and David loves
buying clothes for her, though he is careful to explain that he certainly
does not buy all her clothes.
'I sometimes feel a bit guilty and wonder if I am trying to create the sort
of Barbie doll I would like to be married to. But on the whole I think that
my motivation is otherish rather than selfish,' he says.
'The first item I ever bought her was a pair of knickers with attached
suspenders, slightly naughty as we were not yet engaged. Tights had yet to
be invented. I was a penniless student so technically she might have paid
for them. I do get funny looks in certain shop departments but it does not
bother me very much as I face potentially embarrassing situations in the
hospital every day.
'The first important piece of clothing that I got for Angela was her
going-away outfit, a rather unusual garment. We were going skiing so I chose
a beautiful maroon corduroy plus-four suit from Simpsons in Piccadilly - the
shop has been sending me brochures ever since and I sometimes shop there. I
am not in charge of Angela's clothes. If I was she would never have a skirt
or a bra or any of the real essentials. I buy things rather on an ad hoc
basis, usually when I am away at a conference or something.'
Angela remembers a time 'about 15 years ago when the children were very
small and David went out to do the weekend shop - meat, two veg., that sort
of thing. Hours later he came back with dozens of Harrod's bags filled with
co-ordinating skirts, blouses, the first culottes . . . an entire wardrobe.
It was wonderful.'
David says that whenever he goes abroad 'the standard present that I buy for
Angela when I am on business is a silver bracelet; come to think of it my
mother has got a lovely Jensen silver bracelet, and my father often went
shopping with my mother to choose clothes with her and she is also very
elegant. '
He admits that he thinks he has made the occasional mistake. 'But I think
Angela is too polite to mention them. One disaster I remember was a sort of
1920s dress with silver lurex threads running through it. I don't read
Harpers or Vogue but did feel very ahead of things when I bought a dress and
jacket with shoulder pads in Macy's. It must have been about the time that
the television soap Dallas was showing, and some lady, who thought I was
trying to pick her up, tried it on for size. My daughter is three inches
taller than my wife and I don't always get things right for her - she won't
even let me cut her hair, although I cut her mother's'
Angela rarely buys clothes for her husband as he is 'always on the verge of
losing some weight.' She feels that she never gets ties quite right, but she
is the arbiter of taste when it comes to the house and particularly
furniture.
'Wine is my thing,' adds David, 'and I do feel that there are different
sorts of money: funny money that you buy a house with, silly money, and
goodie money for clothes and things . . . but that is crucial, too.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Surfeit of a good thing - Champagne is in
crisis, with falling prices and over-production. What does it mean for the
consumer?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS much confusion about champagne. Is it as good as it used to be? Is
it too expensive - especially the well-known brands?
In general, the quality is higher, thanks to more stringent regulations in
the trade and competition outside. In the boom years, up to 1989, when
demand threatened to exceed supply of grapes, just about anything sold -
including champagne made from low-quality, immature grapes.
Today, new and improved presses have raised the quality of the must, the
third pressing has been eliminated, and the inclusion of the second pressing
may be suspended while crops are so large and sales reduced. Also, the
minimum legal bottle age before it is released for sale may be increased
from 12 to 15 or 18 months, while cash-flow problems may delay replanting
and increase the average age of the vines in some vineyards.
The combination of three exceptionally large crops - with a fourth likely
this year - and the recession that began in 1990, has led to the highest
age-level of stocks for nearly 20 years, when the excess quantities were
much smaller. They have now reached the equivalent of nearly a billion
bottles in cask, still wine and bottle. This is nearly five years' worth of
saleable champagne, rather than the traditional three. And the interest
charged on an extra year's stock in densely-packed cellars is formidable.
Hit particularly hard have been those growers (cultivateurs-manipulants) who
market their own wines, mostly to private clients and the co-ops, which are
obliged to buy their members' wines. Although there are excellent growers
who sell privately to clients all over France, the majority do so on what is
called a premier prix basis: as soon as possible after the minimum one-year
ageing in bottle is past.
Such growers have been hit by supermarkets which sell champagne at prices as
low as FFr50 (Pounds 5.69) a bottle and, at special times of the year, as
low as FFr40. One might have a regular petit fournisseur down in the Vallee
du Marne but, rather than buying a couple of cases occasionally and paying
the freight, in difficult times it is more convenient to drop into a French
supermarket and pick up a couple of bottles.
Champagne is expensive because the grapes and the method of production are
costly. If, as is suggested, the price of grapes is reduced this coming
vintage from FFr24 to FFr20 for the top village wines, it will be FFr16 for
the lowest. It takes 1.2 kilos of grapes a bottle and, after materials,
labour and interest charges, the total will exceed FFr43 without overheads
or depreciation. One of the largest, most-respected manipulants, with
holdings in top-quality Cote des Blanc vineyards and selling 200,000 bottles
a year, told me: 'We cannot live on FFr50 a bottle]' They sell it for more
to the British high street wine merchant Oddbins, which now retails the 1989
Blanc de Blanc for Pounds 16.75.
If grape prices were to fall further, the merchants would secure fewer
grapes, as the growers would sell to the co-ops, and improved quality would
be at risk. Worse, many more growers might start to make their own champagne
without the necessary know-how, the sophisticated equipment or the marketing
experience.
The overall picture today shows that, for large-scale selling, there are two
fairly distinct quality/price levels of champagne: the variable quality,
low-price ones, retailing in the UK from below Pounds 10 a bottle up to
Pounds 12; and the should-be-reliable, non-vintage at grande marque level
that dominates the international trade, costing between Pounds 17 and Pounds
22. Additionally, there are the vintage and prestige cuvees, sales of which
 -apart from Dom Perignon and Roederer Cristal - are small at up to Pounds
50 a bottle.
So, what to get? For low-price champagnes, you should buy selectively,
almost certainly not at the lowest prices and avoiding those with fancy
label names. Such champagnes could be bargains but, as with some I have
tried, they may be coarse and short in bouquet and taste. The best way is to
test them by buying single bottles of several brands. Supermarkets' own
labels may be the best.
Champagne needs some ageing and, for this, the grandes marques have a great
advantage. The average age of their non-vintage stocks may be approaching
five years and should be flavoursome and rounded, with an attractive
bouquet. Their prices have come down, too, if only - in Britain - because of
sterling's devaluation. But all Champagne is in crisis, with few of the
houses making a profit. There is plenty of reason to buy now.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Labels that tell a story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON

<DATELINE>
   CERTAINTIES seem to have disappeared in the world of champagne
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
except for the certainty that selling it is extremely difficult just now.
Once, we were told that only the so-called grandes marques, or big brands
such as Moet &amp; Chandon and Mumm, had the stocks and blending ability to
produce reliably good wine. Champagnes made by growers in much smaller
operations were dismissed as kitchen sink concoctions; and as for
supermarket champagne - well, that was simply undrinkable.
In the British wine market today, the grandes marques (now re-defining
themselves, in any case) have been losing share to a plethora of less
familiar labels. Some are from individual growers, some from co-operatives,
and some from substantial operations which specialise in buyer's own brand
(BOB) champagne (such as the giant Marne et Champagne, the bottling lines of
which supply a multitude of Pol Thises and Veuve Thats).
This is not just because the British have become a nation of cheapskates but
because UK wine merchants have discovered that growers' champagnes can be
delicious and that some of the BOB cuvees can offer fair value, even in
comparison with the dramatically improved sparkling wines of the new world.
One merchant, Bibendum of London NW1, recently celebrated an offer of its
four favourite growers' non-vintage champagnes by organising a blind
comparison of them with five grandes marques. Extraordinarily, the
preference of customers - on the ground of taste alone - was for the
cheapest of all, Albert Beerens Reserve at Pounds 11.99.
Their second favourite was another inexpensive Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs
champagne from Michel Fearat at Pounds 13.99. Bollinger, the most expensive
wine of all at Pounds 21.50, took only third place, just above Louis
Roederer, Veuve Clicquot and Pommery.
My favourite - and that of Bibendum's Willie Lebus - was the
beautifully-balanced, mouth-filling Cuvee de Reserve from grower Henri
Billiot of the top-quality Pinot Noir village of Ambonnay. At Pounds 17.99
(and available also from Adnams of Southwold), it is not cheap; but it is
extremely well-priced for a connoisseur's champagne of this quality which
could be served happily throughout a meal.
For those who insist on a name their guests will recognise, Bibendum has a
particularly good price on Pommery (Pounds 13.95), which showed well in this
tasting.
For champagne at rock-bottom prices, the supermarkets cannot be beaten and
are at constant war with each other over price and quality. Probably the
best value at the moment is Tesco's Louis Massing Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs
at just Pounds 8.99, an all-Chardonnay wine apparently exclusively from
top-rated vineyards. It tastes relatively hard-pressed and exhibits the
green apple taste of very young champagne, but it is a perfectly respectable
aperitif.
Tesco describes Massing's own prime vineyards in Avize on the back label,
but is careful not to claim that this wine is the produce of them because,
in fact, Massing is a negociant, or champagne house, which also buys-in
grapes.
The picture is confused further by the number of growers who stick their own
labels on the produce of the co-operative to which they belong, so that a
champagne which looks very personal to the consumer really comes from an
enormous blending vat.
The Champenois have long had two letter codes which must appear on every
champagne label; these allow those interested to identify the status of a
given champagne producer. NM denotes one of the 250-plus champagne houses
which buy-in and blend wine, and own vineyards as well. CM denotes one of
the 42 co-operatives, which own about 200 brands between them. And MA
denotes one of the several thousand BOB brands.
Since last December, however, growers have had to declare themselves as
either RM (one of the 2,100 producers of champagne from their own grapes) or
RC (a grower which puts its own label on a co-operative wine).
So, once these labels have made their way into commercial channels, we can
all identify genuine growers' champagnes (RM), and genuine champagne houses
(NM), although good short sight is required.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Where to find the best Festival fare -
Nicholas Lander picks his favourite places to eat and drink in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DISCOVER the restaurateur's view of life during the Edinburgh Festival I
phoned Tim Cumming, chef-proprietor of the Vintners' Rooms, a man who had
catered for festival goers at his previous restaurant in Bath.
Was it, I asked him, the equivalent of two Christmases in a year? Better,
came his prompt response. The festival lasts longer; because of the timing
and the frequency of the performances customers hop from restaurant to
restaurant as well as from event to event; corporate entertaining is rife.
But the unique ingredient, he added, is the atmosphere. The only time
Edinburgh had the same sense of carnival, he felt, was before, and after, a
rugby international at Murrayfield.
Visitors to the Edinburgh Festival obviously contribute to this ambience but
in return they benefit from two elements particular to this city.
The first is that the Edinburgh restaurant scene is an excellent example of
an open market at work. This is a medium sized city with an unusually large
number of restaurants, cafes and bars (I have never been anywhere with so
many privately owned, personally run restaurants). Demand regulates price
and, although there are expensive restaurants, I feel that in Edinburgh's
restaurants, prices are lower overall and the price/quality ratio higher
than anywhere else in Britain.
The second factor in ensuring such good value for money owes more to history
than economics. Perhaps because of the Auld Alliance and Edinburgh's long
association with France, Edinburgh restaurant-goers demand quality.
Like the French - but still unlike most of us long-suffering Brits - the
burghers of this city vote with their feet: those places that become too
expensive or unappreciative of their customers lose out to those places that
are prepared to look after them better. For the restaurateurs, Edinburgh is
a demanding market place; for the consumer, there are some certainly some
wonderful treats.
UNIQUELY EDINBURGH
In the newly opened Traverse Theatre, Cambridge Street, close to the Lyceum
Theatre and Usher Hall, a good looking bar in the basement with food and, on
the ground floor, the Atrium restaurant with chef Andrew Radford (228-8882),
and next door his sandwich bar, The Kiosk. (All numbers take an 031 prefix,
the Edinburgh code).
Les Partisans, (known by the locals as Les Patersons]) Royal Mile,
(225-5144) great value food and wines; Cafe d'Odile, under the French
Institute in Randolph Crescent but not licensed and lunch only (225-5366);
The Doric, Market Street (225-1084), Le Marche Noir, Eyre Place (558-1608)
for its wines too and Pierre Victoire, Victoria Street, (225-1721) for
exceptionally low prices. Kelly's, West Richmond Street, (668-3847), has a
strong local following.
Leith, Edinburgh's harbour, offers a wide range: The Vintners' Rooms,
(554-6767) where, in the candle-lit vaults, you can almost sense the ghost
of Bonnie Prince Charlie; Marinette (555-0922) and Skippers (554-1018) for
fish. The Waterfront, Dock Place, (554-7427) and The Shore Bar, (554-5080),
The Shore, are two popular bars with good food and wines.
ALL DAY EATING
Maison Hector, Stockbridge (332-5328) for great soups and close by, Bell's
Diner (225-8116) for the best hamburgers and bratburgers for the children;
Cafe Florentin, (225-6267) St. Giles Street off the Royal Mile, open 24
hours during the Festival; Helios Fountain, a coffee house/ bookshop in the
Grassmarket (229-7884)
VEGETARIAN
Kalpna, Patrick Square (667-9890) where a plate of Indian food from their
lunchtime counter is about Pounds 3; Black Bo's, Blackfriars Street,
(557-6136), just off the Royal Mile; the long-running Henderson's, Hanover
Street (225-2131) and the recently opened Pierre Lapin, West Nicolson Street
(668-4332).
ETHNIC
For distinctive Italian food, Pellicano (661-6914) at 110, Easter Road and
Tinelli along the road at number 139 (652- 1392). More central, at 58 North
Castle Street, is the more expensive Cosmo (226-6743).
For Thai food Siam Erawan, 48, Howe Street (226-3675), Kris in Raeburn Place
for Malaysian cooking (315-2200), Kweilin (557-1875) and Loon Fung
(556-1781) for Chinese food.
The Far Pavilions (332-3362), Shamiana (228-2265), Suruchi (556-6583),
opposite the Empire Theatre and Monsoon (346-0204), complete with a beer
list, for spicier Indian cooking.
DRINKING The most elegant venue is still the Cafe Royal at the east end of
Princes Street, complete with oyster bar. By the King's Theatre are Bennet's
and The Golf Tavern; for draught Guinness and Murphys try the Barony Bar in
Broughton Street.
Great pubs include Mather's, Queensferry Road, The Cumberland Bar and the
Bow Bar, with a huge range of malt whiskies, Kay's in Jamaica Street, the
Canny Man's in Morningside Road and the aptly named Malt Shovel Inn, just
off the Royal Mile.
In Leith visit Tod's Tap in Bernard Street and/or treat yourself to a malt
whisky tasting at the Scotch Malt Whisky Association, 87, Giles Street
(031-554 3451).
EXPENSIVE Martins, Rose St, North Lane (225-3106), particularly for his
range of exciting Scottish cheeses; The Witchery, Castlehill (225-5613), and
the Pompadour restaurant in the Caledonian Hotel (225-2433). L'Auberge, 58,
St Mary's Street, (556-5888) offers better value at lunch than dinner.
Finally, should you want to escape the 1.3m festival-goers, try to get a
booking at La Potiniere in Gullane (0620-843214) a 45-minute drive west.
Lunch Tuesday-Sunday, dinner Saturday only with one of the country's great,
and most reasonably priced, wine lists.
An invaluable guide to many of Edinburgh's attractions is the recently
published Scotland the best] by Peter Irvine (published by Mainstream,
Pounds 9.99).

FT  14 AUG 93 / Cookery: It's time to pass the pork, please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO AVOID eating pork in summer is a safety precaution that no longer applies
in this age of refrigeration. Old prejudices are not easily dispelled,
however, and many butchers still find it hard to sell pork when there is no
'R' in the month. To encourage more shoppers, summer pork is often sold
cut-price - good news for bargain hunters.
Pork tonnato makes a fine summer party dish at half the cost of veal
tonnato. Another splendid choice is loin of pork boned and rolled round a
stuffing of mushrooms or prunes and pistacchio.
This is braised in a glass or two of white wine with the pork bones and rind
alongside the joint so that the amber liquid sets to a jelly that can be
chopped and served with the succulent cold meat.
August is, however, a holiday month, the time when most cooks hang up their
aprons so far as entertaining is concerned. Homely dishes suitable for
family picnics and speedy suppers to serve at the end of a long day's outing
are what is needed. Kitchens in rented holiday cottages tend to be basic, so
the simpler the cooking the better.
Making sausagemeat and pate mixtures from lean belly of pork is fun and not
very hard work.
This month at any rate, rather than make my own sausagemeat from scratch, I
favour buying the best sausages the butcher offers (or buying a reliable,
high meat content supermarket offering, such as Waitrose's Traditional Pork
Sausages). Take the meat out of the skins, work in a few extra seasonings
and use it to make such things as sausage rolls, scotch eggs and meatballs.
To put such dishes on the menu will win no marks for originality, but if
they are freshly cooked and prepared with care, they may earn the cook a
standing ovation from senior as well as junior Billy Bunters.
SCOTCH QUAILS' EGGS (makes two dozen)
No larger than plums, the ratio of meat to egg makes these especially good.
Eat them on the day of making, preferably hot from the pan, with a salad,
or, more traditionally, eat them cold.
2 dozen quails' eggs (or 1 dozen hen's eggs), hard-boiled, cooled and
shelled; 1 1/2 lb meaty, coarse cut sausages; 1 garlic clove, crushed; fresh
torn tarragon leaves; 1-2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese; Dijon
mustard; 2 beaten eggs;  1/4 lb fine, dried breadcrumbs; oil for frying.
Strip the skins from the sausages and mash the meat with a fork in a soup
plate, gradually working in the garlic, tarragon and Parmesan. Divide the
mixture into 24 pieces. Flatten them, one at a time, on a damp work surface
into a circle large enough to wrap round a quail's egg. Spread each circle
with a little mustard, place a shelled egg on top and mould the sausagemeat
round it firmly and evenly, making sure there are no cracks.
Roll the meat-enrobed eggs in highly seasoned flour, dip in beaten egg and
coat with breadcrumbs. Chill to set the coating, for at least 15 minutes,
before frying in batches in oil heated to 350-360 F (180-185 C). They will
need about four minutes. Drain well.
SAUSAGE ROLLS (makes 20) Delicious hot and almost as good cold. Ideally the
added seasonings should be mixed into the sausagemeat an hour or more before
baking to allow flavours to blend.
1 lb meaty, coarse cut sausages; 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped;
the leaves stripped from a few sprigs of thyme and oregano (or chopped
rosemary needles or shredded sage leaves); 11-12oz ready-made puff pastry;
beaten egg to glaze.
Strip the skins from the sausages and mash the meat with a fork in a soup
plate, gradually working in the garlic, herbs, and a little salt.
Cut the pastry into six pieces. Roll each one to an oblong 4 x 12 inches and
let them rest for 10 minutes.
Divide the sausagemeat into six pieces and roll each piece, with floured
hands on a floured work surface, into a 12in rope.
Lay the 'ropes' down the length of the pastry strips, slightly to one side.
Paint the pastry edges with beaten egg. Fold the pastry over the meat and
seal the edges firmly, pressing with the prongs of a fork.
Cut the sausage rolls into 3in lengths and transfer them to damp baking
sheets. Glaze with beaten egg, slash the tops to allow steam to escape and
bake for 25-30 minutes at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 until golden, puffed up
and crisp.
MEATBALLS WITH APPLE &amp; FENNEL (serves 4-5)
1lb meaty, coarse cut sausages; 1 garlic clove crushed with salt and mixed
with  1/2 teaspoon bruised fennel seed; 1 dessert apple (Braeburn from New
Zealand are probably the best bet just now); 2-3 fennel bulbs; 1-2
tablespoons chopped parsley;  1/4 pt Bulmer's No. 7 (or unsweetened apple
juice plus 1 teaspoon vinegar); butter and olive oil for frying.
Strip the skins from the sausages and mash the meat with the garlic and
fennel seed. Break off small pieces of the mixture and roll into 16-20 small
balls.
Trim the fennel, cut the bulbs into wedges and fry them in a little butter
and oil. Remove and keep warm. Then fry the apple, peeled and cut into
crescent moon slices.
Add a drop more oil to the pan if necessary and, when it is hot, add the
meatballs. Saute them, shaking the pan to roll and turn them, until slightly
crusted outside and cooked right through.
Lift them out. Deglaze the pan with the cider, letting it bubble up while
you scrape the meaty sediment from the pan base. Pour the gravy over the
meatballs and serve them with the fennel and apple, sprinkled with parsley,
on a generous bed of mashed potatoes.

A sign of the times in Bordeaux is the just-released, greatly reduced
opening price of Chateau Petrus 1992, as offered by its UK agents, Corney &amp;
Barrow, London EC2 (071-251 4051). In advance of a very large but mostly wet
vintage, not only was severe summer pruning undertaken, but from the
beginning of September the whole 11 hectare vineyard was covered by plastic
sheeting - a costly operation. Picking took place on three sunny afternoons
between September 23 and October 1. The result was 3,000 cases of 12.8' wine
 -25 per cent fewer cases than normal. No Petrus 1991 was offered, but
compared with opening in-bond-London prices of Pounds 1,150, a case for the
1989 and Pounds 1,050 for the 1990, the 1992 is offered at Pounds 550 - as
the quantity is limited, on allocation.

Invergordon Distillers recently invited a number of drinks writers to the
Hebridean island of Jura to select a special release at cask strength. We
nosed 20 whiskies at between 54' and 63', and now 200 bottles of this
'critics' choice' whisky have been released for sale. The 20-year-old whisky
(54') has a pleasant, nutty character from refilled sherry hogshead.
Enquiries to Invergordon (031-554-4404). UK price Pounds 39.95, including
P&amp;P.

<TEXT>
IT IS ONE of those perfect Fridays when the sun beats down from a deep blue
sky and a light wind ruffles the tree tops. I am waiting to see Brazilian
television reporter Gil Gomes, along with what appears to be the dregs of
Sao Paulo society gathered together on a bench.
Suddenly, a man in a long beige mac appears, collar upturned and right hand
thrust deep in a pocket from which bulges what can only be a large revolver.
A vein on his pasty forehead throbbing, he paces in front of me so that I am
forced to stare at his yellow linen trousers and scuffed loafers.
Behind Mr Long Mac, I see the figure of Gomes' son beckoning me away to a
back entrance. 'That man has come to kill my father,' says Gomes Jnr, with
apparent calm.
Gil Gomes is a crime reporter. Not just an ordinary crime reporter but a
master of the dramatic pause who re-enacts crimes and acts of violence in
agonising detail, lingering over the goriest parts. While debate in some
countries rages over excess violence in films and television, Brazil has an
entire programme dedicated to showing nothing but the day's most grisly
crime and violence.
Every night at 6.30, around 30m Brazilians tune into SBT to watch Here and
Now - a 90-minute tabloid show which calls itself 'The programme that shows
life as it really is.' It is so popular that it now competes directly with
the country's main news bulletin.
An average night could start with a dramatic police chase over roof-tops in
the centre of Sao Paulo. The highlight of the programme is usually a
gruesome murder - which is the moment the viewers are waiting for. The
slightly hunch-backed figure and pock-marked face of Gomes appears, leering
into the camera, above a headline such as 'Trail of blood on the Andarilho
road.' The gravelly voice begins: 'This is the story of a young girl called
Ana Maria from Ceara, a story which revolted this community.'
As the camera follows him along a dirt track to a simple house, Gomes tells
how Ana Maria came south to Sao Paulo and found love and happiness. One day,
she was in the house, cooking tea happily for her husband and child. 'What
she didn't know,' says Gomes, 'was that an element with evil intent and
various run-ins with the police was looking for a place to rob.' (He always
refers to criminals as 'elements').
One of Gomes' specialities is interviewing murderers and close relatives of
their victims, sometimes even bringing them together; so, at this point, he
turns to Ana's grief-stricken husband. 'She was spectacular, special, a good
mother,' says Gomes as the new widower nods, tearfully.
Back on the dirt track, the suspense is building. To the sound of a rolling
drum, Gomes continues: 'The element began walking along the road looking for
a way in.' The camera closes in on his loafers as he enters the house. 'Ana
was in the kitchen . . . she cried out, the children began crying . . . when
neighbours came, it was too late . . . they found Ana with a knife stuck in
the back of her neck.'
His face close to the camera, Gomes growls: 'There can be no explanations,
not a single explanation for such a barbaric crime.'
The camera swings to a terrified suspect who is denying everything. 'You're
not a saint, are you,' snarls Gomes. The man is condemned - he is wearing
one shoe and one boot which fit footprints in the mud found by Gomes and the
police, and has blood on his shirt.
Back in his office in the leafy Jardins suburb of Sao Paulo, Gomes proves a
surprisingly gentle character, although unapologetic for his blood-chilling
performance. 'Unfortunately, here in Brazil, police take notice only when
crime has been committed against rich or influential people,' he says. 'In
common cases there is no investigation, nothing. Here and Now has introduced
a new philosophy that everyone is important, whatever their class.'
He refuses to accept that showing violence on the screen can induce more;
instead, he sees himself as a kind of anti-crime crusader. 'There is too
much violence in the world, but what we are showing is not gratuitous
violence but news. The idea is to show the stupidity and barbarity of crimes
and to show that crime doesn't pay. I always show cases being resolved,
assassins being imprisoned.'
Gomes believes he is boosting police morale in a country where the police
themselves often are the first suspects in crimes. He has, personally,
solved more than 600 murders in 20 years as a crime reporter.
Gomes has no shortage of material. Brazil is one of the world's most violent
countries and he has 22 murders a day from which to choose in Sao Paulo
alone. He says: 'I still get very shocked by what I see, particularly as
more than two-thirds of these crimes could have been avoided if we had a
better social structure and prison system.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Walton: the Compleat truth: Angling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE travelling to the ancient city of Winchester in Hampshire for my
exclusive 400th birthday interview with the man we call 'The Father of the
Angle', I first read the book which secured his immortality. Never before
had I got far beyond the Compleat of the title, and wondering about the old
chap's spelling.
Actually, it is not half bad, if that doesn't sound too condescending. When
you think what else was on offer to lovers of prose in the 17th century -
Milton's Areopagitica for instance - it is hardly surprising that Izaak
Walton's musings on fish, milkmaids and the pastoral beauties of England
became a best seller.
I tracked him down to his study in the home of his son-in-law, Prebendary
Hawkins. It is a fine old house in the cathedral close. Outside the sun
shone fitfully on a pleasing garden enclosed by antique walls, with a view
of the cathedral beyond. As he made me welcome, I mentioned Milton.
'As a man, I did not love him. He was as a pike, a tyrant melancholy and
bold, a pertinacious schismatic and Republican. For you should know, Master
Thomas, that I was ever for the King and the established Church. But he was
the chief poet of the land, and I a mere chronicler of the lives of better
men.'
He nodded, and was quiet for a moment, then added: 'And my Compleat Angler,
if I am not mistook, has been published in nigh on 400 editions in this
kingdom, and America, and even in distant Japan; which, I trow, is a fate
unenjoyed by that tedious Areopagitica.'
Anyone who has dipped into Walton's book will have been struck by its
distinctive tone: sweet, amiable, innocent, without malice.
I asked him about Sam Johnson, whose enthusiasm for the Compleat Angler
inspired its revival after a period of comparative neglect.
'Johnson was a man of prudence, deep learning and piety, a good Royalist
filled with virtue and mental vigour and wit. True, he was an abomination to
behold, dropsical and ever a-twitch. He was unquiet in spirit. I believe
angling would have been more beneficent medicine to him than the tea he
drank in such immoderate volume.'
I had spotted inside the front door, hung on a brass knob, a bulbous leather
container which I assumed to be Walton's creel. Stretched along the wall
above was six yards of ash and hazel, with a tendril of horsehair attached
to the narrow end.
'Dost thou', I began, then corrected myself. 'Presumably, Mr Walton, you
don't do a great deal of fishing now?'
'I am too old and infirm, Master Thomas', he replied. 'And, besides, it
would fill my heart with sadness to see the streams I remember from my young
manhood as they are now. What fate has o'ertaken the Wandle, whence Thos.
Barker and I would walk of a Maytime morn to ply the angle?'
'It runs by Youngs Brewery in the London borough of Wandsworth, Father
Izaak.'
'And what of its trout? I recall one of more than 20 inches, which I took
with a caterpillar. Its belly was as yellow as a marigold, and part as white
as a lily. We, Barker and I and Dr Donne - who was no fisher but loved
abundantly the eating of them - had it in a sauce of marjoram, sweet thyme,
winter savory, anchovies and sweet butter.'
The Wandle is now a dark, lifeless stream, strewn with supermarket trolleys
and beer cans. 'They are no more, I fear, sir. Though they make a fine ale
at its banks.'
'And what of the lovely Lea?' he inquired. 'And of the Dove, where so oft I
angled with my beloved friend Cotton?'
'There are still trouts in the Dove', I said. 'And, marry, the cottage which
Cotton built for you still stands, with its motto piscatoribus sacrum above
the door, and the initials of yourself and Cotton intertwined on the
keystone.'
The old man sighed. 'Ah, Charles, I loved him as a son. Doubtless he was, as
they told me, a roisterous soul and dubious versifier. But to me he was ever
gentle and filled with reverence; and in the matter of angling with the fly
for trouts and graylings he was a master of guile.'
There was much I wished to ask him, but I could tell that he was growing
weary. I knew that I had to hit him with the controversial questions now. I
asked: 'Forgive me for vexing you, Mr Walton, but I must put to you the
charge that the Compleat Angler was not original, that you took other
people's ideas without acknowledgement.'
'Master Thomas', he chided. 'He who turns his back on the wisdom of others
is no wise man but a fool. This complaint was made against me by one Richard
Franck, a trooper in Cromwell's army and a right cribbed and dolorous soul.
And how many editions are there of his dreary tales, I wonder?'
I pressed on: 'And what about the allegation that you were - sorry, are - a
credulous dupe? Believing that pike were bred from a special weed, and that
eels were spawned by dew, and that frogs eat fishes' eyes and so on?'
'Peradventure I was wrong. Many matters are known now which were not known
then. But for all this knowledge, Master Thomas, are we more contented now?'

<DATELINE>
   SHANGHAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLONEL could hardly have found himself displayed in more handsome
surroundings, or have provided quite such an affront to historical memory
gilded by years of absence. There he was in all his finger-lickin'
awfulness, stuck to the colonial facade of the old Dong Feng hotel on
Shanghai's Bund, the city's waterfront corniche.
There was, however, worse to come. Inside the Dong Feng, formerly the
Shanghai Club and once the preserve of gin-sodden expatriates and their
ladies-in-waiting, there was more excess. The long wooden bar - the longest
bar in all Asia in its day - had been taken away and replaced by a Colonel
Sanders fast food establishment with its synthetic plastic red and white
livery. The stale vapours of Kentucky fried chicken wafted across what had
been a marbled entrance hall of some majesty in the faded days of empire.
Returning to Shanghai after 10 years, I felt a strange sense of dislocation:
regretful of a fading, less complicated past, yet exhilarated by a new
vitality. For the city is awakening like an oriental Rip Van Winkle after
years of heavy-handed control from Beijing, fearful of Shanghai's unruly
reputation as a crucible of new, and possibly dangerous, ideas.
The Chinese Communist party was founded in Shanghai. To Mao and his comrades
in 1921, it was a city of excess, of riches beyond imagining, but also a
human sink - the perfect place to start a revolution. These days, there is
barely a whiff of political contrariness; rather, the scent is one of money,
of getting on and getting rich.
At the Shenyin Securities company, where long queues of stock market punters
form each day in a drab, suburban street, I met a small, balding man named
Tsao who was waiting for his daughter to emerge from a scrum of people
besieging the counters inside. The 76-year-old Tsao, it emerged, was a
Shanghai 'millionaire' before the revolution took it all. He appeared
affronted when I confessed that I had not heard of his now-defunct business,
the 'famous' Wasong electric fan company.
The communists had expropriated the company and his shares in other
enterprises had been made worthless, yet Tsao was punting again with meagre
savings. Why, after being scalded once? I asked, to which he replied with a
toothless grin: 'Because I can't help myself.'
Across the city on the banks of smelly Suzhou creek, in a converted hotel
ballroom, the Shanghai stock exchange, the city's new temple of capitalism,
was registering Tsao's modest (Dollars 53) investment. Other, bigger punters
are in the field, like 'Million Yang,' a former Shanghai worker who is
famous the length and breadth of China for his stock-picking acumen.
In time, Million Yang may become the stuff of legend in the tradition of
Shanghai's dubious personalities of the past, like Big-Eared Du and
Pockmarked Huang; or of other colourful figures who occupied a nether world
of secret societies such as the Green Hand.
A writer on Shanghai observed many years ago that its vocation had never
been government or art or religion; it had been money-making. Shanghai's
leaders, communist in name only these days, have, like religious converts,
embraced the city's zest for commerce with rare enthusiasm. Mayor Huang Ju
is lyrical about his plans to make Shanghai the 'dragon head' of the Yangtze
river valley, the 'gateway to the world outside.'
Dressed in conservative suit and tie and wearing platformed, tasselled
shoes, Mayor Huang is the very model of the modern Chinese official, dancing
nimbly around questions about Mao and Marx, communism and capitalism, then
and now. China's turbulent past, its class struggle, its Soviet-style
central planning, its mass political campaigns, are 'part of history.' What
is important, he says, is to look forward - and he is probably right, since
to dwell on the past would be to remind oneself of wasted years and behavior
best forgotten.
Shanghai no longer moves at the measured pace that I recall. People surge
through narrow streets and traffic is caught in endless jams. Moving west
along Nanjing Road, the city's main shopping street, you find yourself borne
on a human tide; and if you wish to leave the torrent, you are obliged to
negotiate your way carefully, like crossing a river.
Ten years ago, it was possible to stroll and browse, poking into stodgy,
Soviet-style emporiums like the No 1 Department Store where sleepy sales
assistants barely acknowledged your presence. Now, Nanjing road has come
alive with shops like Benetton, Stefanel and the Sincere Department Store.
Its Shanghainese owners, refugees from communism, have returned to claim
their birthright, if not the exact location on which the old Sincere store
stood before the revolution.
In these new, gleaming retail temples, people engage in a kind of
consumerism gone mad. Shopping in Benetton one day, I removed my pullover to
try on a new one, only to find that my shapeless relic had been borne away
by the crowd: it was no easy task to retrieve it.
Travelling further west across Tibet Road, which forms the great traffic
divide between the eastern part of the city and the western (traffic on
either side gridlocks in a honking, blaring cacophony), you come to a
structure not unlike the grandstand at a racecourse.
Indeed, this was a race-stand before the revolution put paid to such
frivolity. The building is now the municipal library, and the race-course
itself has been divided into a drab 'people's park' and 'people's square.'
If, by chance, you visit the park on a Sunday and allow yourself to be drawn
towards small groups, talking and debating in a dusty corner, you will hear
a multitude of tongues in excited babble. English predominates, and strange
conversations materialise.
'My name is David Copperfield,' said one old man, by way of introduction.
'Mine is Charles Dickens,' I said, to which he replied: 'I know him well,'
before shuffling off into the crowd.
In Shanghai now, anything seems possible, although slavish attachment to
western fads and fashion jars and you dream of the days when Shanghai, like
the rest of China, seemed other-worldly. There is not much that is
other-worldly about the JJ Disco, though - a throbbing palace of
western-style rock which is packed to its strobe-lit rafters each night with
1,200 patrons who jiggle and jive on elevated dance floors under a huge
yellow butterfly caught in smoky rays of light. It was not so long ago that
a jazz band was considered risque by the city's party bosses but, these
days, a fairly lurid nightlife has made a comeback, reviving memories of a
seedy past.
Not far from JJ's, in what was known as Frenchtown before the revolution
changed everything, stands the handsome old Jinjiang Club, preserved, as if
in aspic, by the communists and where I and my friends would repair, 10
years ago and more, for a late-evening game of snooker. Now, sadly, the
musty snooker room has gone and so, too, has the old-fashioned restaurant
where we would dine on escargots and filet mignon and be entertained by a
chamber orchestra.
The Jinjiang has become the Garden Hotel Okura, a perfectly renovated and
reconstructed Japanese-style hotel with an orderliness that says less about
the past than it does about the future. The plumbing, I am sure, is flawless
but, somehow, it is not the same.
Happily, the old Peace Hotel on the waterfront has been preserved more or
less intact, and it is there that I stay for old time's sake. Not the least
of its appeal is a marvellous Art Deco reception area where idle moments can
be spent in the gloom - lighting remains faithful to the 1930s - watching
the parade of tourists, Japanese businessman, and the odd journalist who has
forsaken the newly-built glass-and-chrome up-market hotels like the Hilton
and the Portman.
Known before the revolution as the Cathay, the Peace Hotel forms a fusty
link with the past and we are assured by its manager, Mr Wang, that its
character will be preserved. Completed in 1930 and owned by the Sassoon
family, wealthy Jewish merchants from Baghdad, the Peace still lives,
appropriately enough, in the jazz age. There are no plans, insists Mr Wang,
for karaoke bars or discos.
History takes a visitor, returning after many years, to No 76 Mingye Road,
in the old French quarter. It was there, at a meeting on July 21 1921, that
the Communist party of China was born, the venue being the home of one of
the delegates. Mao himself is said to have attended, and the place has been
preserved as a shrine to the birth of communism in China complete with
replica teacups (12) and ashtrays (two) from the first meeting.
But the museum now seems oddly deserted, even ghostlike, as if the mass
movement launched by that first meeting is irrelevant to today's events.
Outside, life flows on in full flood but, inside, the atmosphere is one of
an almost defensive silence, as if daring the visitor to ridicule the
revolution's legacy.
History also propels the visitor away from the commercialism of Nanking
Road, and the bustle of the Bund, north along Sichuan Road to Hongkou Park,
where you can see the memorial to Lu Xun, China's greatest modern writer,
whose biting satirical works poured scorn on bourgeois Chinese society of
the time, in the process helping to re-define Chinese literature. With luck,
new Lu Xuns will emerge to remind the Chinese of their follies, and to
balance the money worship of the present.

no one on the tiny Channel Island of Alderney is sure exactly - a fishermen
named Bertie Cosheril found a heavily-encrusted lump of metal in one of his
lobster pots. It turned out to contain a musket.
Marine archaeologists now believe it dates from Elizabethan times and that
the wreck near which it was discovered could be a ship that sank off the
island in 1592, four years after the Spanish armada. If so, it will be the
first Elizabethan warship ever found.
'The metal looked like a bit of rusty old iron at first,' says Cosheril, a
diminutive 62-year-old, 'and, when I got it to the surface, I thought it
might be a German gun. I took it to the chap at the museum but he didn't
think it was worth bothering about.' It was only when Bertie broke the metal
that he found the musket inside and showed it to two local divers, Fred Shaw
and Dave Rendell.
'We were both excited about it,' says Shaw. 'It's rare to have one in that
fair a condition. Bertie agreed to show us where he found it and, the next
time he went out, we followed. He was going round in a circle and we were
following like a dog on a lead and I was thinking: 'Has he got his marks
right?' when he shouted 'About here, Fred.'
'As I was flipping myself over the side, I remember he called out: 'I hope
you find a cannon.' I just laughed, because I never expected to see one.
But, as I swam down, I couldn't believe my eyes because, in two or three
minutes, I did.'
Rendell also found broken pottery and large pieces of ship timbers. They
reported the new finds but the local authority was not interested. Enter
Martin Woodwood, 44, a professional diver who owns the Maritime Museum at
Bembridge, Isle of Wight, and is a friend of Cosheril's. In 1984, he
persuaded the local divers to have another look at the site. 'In the 16th
century, divers couldn't go down deeper than 30ft-40ft,' he says. 'As this
one was in fairly deep water (around 90ft), they wouldn't have been able to
salvage it.'
In 1985, the area was surveyed with a magnotometer, but it was not until May
12 1991 that they dived again. Woodwood found the cannon Shaw had seen
originally and realised the potential of the site. Shaw then formed a group
to carry on the work and it sent some of the pottery it salvaged to Bob
Burns, archaeologist to the States (government) of Guernsey.
'I'd heard rumours that an interesting wreck had been found, and that it was
early 18th century,' Burns says. 'But when I saw the pottery, I thought:
this isn't 18th century, it's 1600 to 1610.'
The Elizabethan Diving Group - as it now calls itself - has since brought up
more than 100 artefacts. They include iron breastplates, matchlock muskets,
cannon balls, sword scabbards, knife handles, a gun carriage, helmets,
pewter pipe, bowls, spoons and stirrups. 'We've brought up more on a few
dives than they ever found on the Mary Rose,' says Shaw.
Burns adds: 'The wonderful thing about this shipwreck is that it's an
instant in time. You have a whole cross-section of Elizabethan naval and
military life sitting on the bottom of the sea and everything, we believe,
belongs to February 1592. It was a period between Henry VIII and Queen
Elizabeth I, 50 years after the Mary Rose, when seamanship and ships,
weaponry, fighting tactics and methods of killing people all started to
change.'
Which ship was it? No one knows for sure but David Keys, an archaeologist
and writer, consulted the Public Records Office at Kew in west London. He
found that a warship on its way to Brittany sank off Alderney in February
1592 and that Sir John Norris, commander of an English garrison in Brittany,
wrote about certain despatches being lost 'in the ship that went down off
the coast of Alderney.'
Archaeologists are cautious, though. Michael Bowyer, now the licencee of the
site, teaches marine archaeology at Bangor University in north Wales and
this summer has co-directed the professional excavation with Oxford
University archaeologist Mensun Bound. 'It could be one of a number of
ships,' Bowyer says. 'We have a vague suspicion that it might be one called
the Makeshift. A ship of that name was built in 1563 and disappeared from
records around 1592.'
Alderney's Receiver of Wrecks, David Jenkins, has proclaimed the site a
protected area and no one can dive around it without a licence. The ship
itself has become the responsibility of the island's transport committee,
one reason being the cost of conserving the artefacts (there are no plans to
bring up the whole vessel). As Burns explains: 'To conserve even one
breast-plate requires enormous expertise plus a large amount of time and,
thereby, money because, the moment you bring it out of the water, it starts
to deteriorate.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Computing: Big package at a small price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's best-known word processor is WordPerfect and WordPerfect 5.1 for
DOS continues to head the sales charts. It is a big-company product at a
big-company price - Pounds 329. To entice private users to spend their own
money, WordPerfect Corp in 1991 released LetterPerfect, a slightly cut-down
version of WordPerfect 5.1 which costs Pounds 99. Late last year it went
further, and released WordPerfect Works for DOS.
WordPerfect Works (WW) is an integrated package combining five modules -
word processor, spreadsheet, database, graphics editor and communications.
It contains a full version of LetterPerfect, the word processor, a version
of the full-price spreadsheet PlanPerfect 5.1, a version of the full-price
database DataPerfect 2.2, and a version of the full-price graphics editor
DrawPerfect 1.1. Finally there is the communications module, one of whose
most valuable features is the fax facility which can send documents directly
via a fax modem.
WW runs on any IBM-compatible computer with DOS 3.0 or higher and with at
least four megabytes of free hard disk space. List price is Pounds 109 and I
have seen WW advertised via mail order at Pounds 62.
WordPerfect 5.1, PlanPerfect, DrawPerfect and DataPerfect together retail
for well over Pounds 1,000, yet WW, which combines all four of them, costs a
tenth of this. Where is the catch? There is no catch. In practice these
versions contain 95 per cent of their full-price equivalents. In the case of
LetterPerfect, the only serious loss I can see from full WordPerfect is that
it will not handle multiple columns of text (for newsletters, etc). The
reason for the low price is that WW is marketed low-key as a SOHO ('small
office, home office') product. This puts off the corporate buyer who always
has to have the 'power-user' version with all the bells and whistles, even
if it costs 10 times as much.
There are two potential purchasers of WW. The first is someone who uses
WordPerfect 5.1, PlanPerfect, DataPerfect or DrawPerfect at work and wants
to be able to run these packages at home. WW has file compatibility with all
four. A disk created at work under WordPerfect, for example, can be taken
home, loaded on to a machine running WW, and worked on, then taken back to
work and loaded onto the WordPerfect machine. To this group WW can be
recommended unreservedly.
The second, larger group comprises those who are looking for a
modestly-priced integrated package to cater for most of their computing
needs. For them I am not so sure. WordPerfect has its own peculiar set of
conventions different from those prevailing throughout the software
industry. For example, the Escape key does not mean Escape; it means
Undelete. The Help key is not F1, but F3. WordPerfect Corp does not believe
in dialogue boxes, so in order to select options you constantly find
yourself having to switch your eyes to the bottom of the screen. This is
awkward and gives WordPerfect a slightly old-fashioned feel.
However, you can get used to all this. On the plus side, WordPerfect's
famous screen display, instead of being cluttered with icons, tool bars,
graphics, etc, accommodates a full 22 lines of text. This, plus the full
complement of keyboard shortcuts, allows for blindingly fast data entry.
The real problem with WW is the manual, which is appalling: 604 pages of
text written for trained systems support staff with no concessions to

FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Cash gift to daughter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM RETIRED and get a small pension. I have lived in the same house for the
past 15 years. Originally, the house was in the joint names of myself and my
daughter; but when she came to live with me six years ago, she paid me half
the then current value for my share.
Now, she is emigrating and is allowing me to continue to live in the house
for as long as I wish. I plan to make her a gift of all my cash, which
includes the original money for my share of the house and interest earned.
The sum is about Pounds 100,000 and represents virtually all my assets.
I am aware of the effects of gifts in relation to inheritance tax,
notwithstanding my assets are presently within the current threshold.
However, I have recently been told that such a gift would also be liable to
capital gains tax as it would represent a disposal. Is this true? And what
proportion would be so taxed?
Were my daughter prepared to sell me the house at current value (approx
Pounds 95,000), would this course of action be more appropriate?
There is no capital gains tax on gifts of sterling. You might like to ask
your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet to capital gains tax,
CGT14.
If your daughter sells the house to you, this could assist her in
establishing that she has ceased to be ordinarily resident in the UK (and
might assist her in establishing that she has acquired a domicile of choice
in the country to which she is emigrating).
On the bare facts outlined, it looks as though she would be exempt from
capital gains tax on the sale, by virtue of section 226 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (Private residence occupied by dependent relative
before 6th April 1988). This, however, is something which she should talk
over with the solicitor who will be acting for her in negotiating the sale.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Power of attorney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE SIGNED a document giving me an enduring power of attorney over the
affairs of an elderly aunt, although I have not yet taken up these duties. I
am not clear regarding the legal and financial obligations of taking on this
responsibility. Can a nephew be made legally responsible for an aunt's debts
(eg, nursing home fees), and does accepting power of attorney change these
responsibilities in any way?
Until 1985, a power of attorney was revoked automatically when the donor
became mentally incapacitated. By the Enduring Power of Attorney Act 1985,
the creation of a power of attorney will survive the donor's subsequent
incapacity. This, as we understand it, is the meaning of an enduring power
of attorney. It does not mean that the power, once granted, can never be
taken away; the donor of any power is at liberty to revoke that power at any
time.
The nature of a power is that it bestows on the donee the authority to deal
with or dispose of property which belongs to another (in this case, your
aunt). A power of attorney allows the donee to perform additional functions,
such as the making of deeds and the conveying of land. As we understand the
situation, the granting of a power of attorney does not make you, the donee,
responsible in law for the liabilities of the donor (that is, your aunt).
You might care to contact the Law Society to see if there is any literature
available on this topic, but a brief consultation with a solicitor would
probably help to clear up any outstanding queries or doubts you may have.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: No logic in tax laws
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has advised that, for the moment, it considers me as
normally resident in the UK for tax purposes.
I had an overseas investment in the Guinness Flight International Balanced
Growth fund, which is in US dollars. To try to maximise currency gains, I
recently switched to a different fund under the same 'umbrella' in pounds
sterling.
It seems to me that the element of gain accruing from movement in exchange
rates should logically be treated as a capital gain as distinct from
movement in the quoted price which, I understand the Inland Revenue treats
as investment income. Both types of gain would then be reported separately
to the Revenue.
Is this the case and, if so, at which exchange rate is the gain in the price
in pounds to be calculated: the start, finish or average?
It is rarely possible to deduce one's UK tax liabilities by the use of
logic. Over the years, we have tried to get across the message that UK
taxation is levied according to complex and arbitrary rules laid down by
parliament with scant regard for logic or equity.
Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 28 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988, your income tax gain will be calculated by deducting the cost
(translated to sterling at the rate of exchange for the day of the purchase
contract) from the market value on the day of the switch (translated to
sterling at the rate of exchange for that day).
You will have a capital gains tax loss equal to indexation on the cost
figure.
If, however, you are regarded by the French tax authorities as resident in
France, then it is possible that article 13(3) of the France-UK double
taxation convention (in conjunction with article 3(2)) will protect you from
assessment to UK income tax on the notional gain.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Afloat in an old pool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have a holding of shares in Redland plc, all of which are in a pre-April
1982 pool. I have now received the additional shares in respect of the
enhanced scrip dividend and I am considering selling them. When these new
shares are sold, do they constitute a new pool or are they to be added to
the base cost of the pre-April 1982 pool and the CGT calculated accordingly?
Like any other bonus (or rights) issue, scrip issue in lieu of a dividend
falls into the same pool as the holding which produced it. In your case,
therefore, the scrip falls into the old pool of Redland shares acquired
before April 6 1982. The free Inland Revenue pamphlet CGT13 should clarify
the rules for you.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: When the penny drops . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME YEARS ago, I bought a number of ordinary shares. Due to a takeover and
the recession, these have now degenerated into 'penny shares.' No dividends
have been paid for some years and they are virtually worthless and not
marketable, although they continue to be quoted in the financial press.
Some time in the not too distant future, it is my intention to sell another
shareholding which is showing substantial gains. I want to offset the cost
of the loss-making shares against the anticipated capital gain.
1. Is it possible to dispose of the now-penny shares by returning the
relevant certificates to the company registrar and asking him to cancel the
registration?
2. Would it be acceptable to give away the shares to a charity or an
individual by returning the certificates to the company registrar and
informing him of the change of ownership?
1. No.
2. Charity: No, you would be deemed to have sold them to the charity at
their indexed cost, broadly speaking, by virtue of section 257 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
Individual: Provided that the person is not a connected person* as defined
in section 286 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, you should be
able to establish an allowable loss by executing a share transfer form in
his or her favour (remembering to complete the stamp duty exemption
certificate on the back) and sending it to the registrar, with the
certificates. Share transfer forms are obtainable from most business
stationers.
You might like to ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The
indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT16 (Indexation allowance:
disposals after 5 April 1988). The pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an
introduction) could also be helpful.
*The term 'connected person' includes your husband, your parents and
parents-in-law, your siblings and siblings-in-law, children and
children-in-law, and your grandchildren and grandchildren-in-law.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A whole new ball game in
Manhattan - A golf range in downtown New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A bright afternoon in New York, with the sunshine bouncing off the glassy
surface of the Hudson River, the waterfront is alive with the sound of iron
hitting ball - a steady thwack, thwack, thwack, interrupted by the
occasional curse of frustration or low whistle of appreciation.
This is pier 25, or to give it its full title, the Manhattan Golf Club. The
club is the first, and so far only, driving range on the famously crowded
island that is home to 1.5m residents and 3.2m day workers.
No one knows exactly how many of those are golfers, but few doubt that
Manhattan Golf Club has exclusive access to the largest number of potential
customers of any driving range, anywhere in the world - all of them packed
within a few square miles.
It was this enormous potential that inspired Greg Cohen and Seth Braunstein,
two 24-year old New Jersey entrepreneurs and avid amateur golfers, to set up
the range at the end of a disused pier just a drive and a long iron away
from the banks, broking houses, insurance companies and trading rooms of
downtown Manhattan.
Today, nine months after the range opened, Cohen and Braunstein are content
with the way their young venture is progressing. When the weather is fine -
which in the summer is most days - there is a steady flow of business, a
flow that can turn into a flood on warm weekday evenings and sunny weekends.
It is all a long way from 1990, when the two recently-graduated friends
decided to pursue a long-held ambition to open Manhattan's first driving
range. At the start, they were so inexperienced that they set out on foot
walking around Manhattan's riverfront looking for possible locations.
They did not know that it only needed one call to the New York State
department of transport, which owns the island's pierfront, to find out
which piers might be available for rent.
Their search for a suitable pier, however, took almost two years. Delays
were caused by mountains of paperwork and by opposition from local
communities and politicians, who feared a driving range would disrupt their
neighbourhoods. The slow grind of bureaucracy and drawn-out battles with
'not-in-my-back-yard' neighbours are hurdles many small American businesses
have to overcome. Even so, Cohen and Braunstein grew frustrated when local
community boards blocked every move. Says Cohen: 'Every time we thought we
were getting somewhere, we hit a dead end.'
Then, in the summer of 1992, their luck turned when they found an outdoor
nightclub on one of the west side piers which had some spare space at the
back, space that under the terms of its lease could only be sub-let for
'sport and recreational purposes'. This meant that Cohen and Braunstein
could build their range free of interference from the community boards.
They quickly struck a deal with the club's owners to pay a rent of slightly
more than Dollars 10,000 a month, and the work of converting the pier into a
golf driving range began. The costs were considerable. It took three months
to build the range. About Dollars 225,000 was spent on materials, and at
least three times that figure on labour, says Cohen.
The equipment costs were also fairly high. They bought about 70 top-quality
clubs, Dollars 12,000 went on an initial batch of golf balls and Dollars
2,000 on the little buggy that collects the balls.
From the start, staff expenses were low. Cohen and Braunstein are at the
range almost every day, and they hire a couple of part-time employees.
Family members are asked to help out when needed, and Hank the rottweiler
provides the security.
The biggest single component of their operating costs is insurance, which,
says Cohen, always had the potential to be a 'deal-breaker' for the entire
project. Initially, they feared the annual premiums would run to several
hundred thousand dollars, because driving ranges are classified as amusement
parks by insurance companies, and therefore as relatively high-risk
ventures.
Cohen and Braunstein found a small company in Indianapolis which specialises
in insuring golf driving ranges. So instead of paying six-figure sums every
year for liability cover and property insurance, 'we're barely in five
figures,' says Cohen.
The Manhattan Golf Club opened in October last year and, given the season,
business got off to a slow start. Then, on December 10, bad luck struck, in
the form of a powerful winter storm that battered New York with
90-mile-an-hour winds.
Pier 25 was hit hard. The storm ripped up the 70ft nets that surround the
range, destroyed much of the electrical wiring, and pulled up some of the
90,000 sq ft of Astroturf. Cohen and Braunstein risked their lives to save
some of the equipment. 'I'm pretty much irrepressible,' says Cohen, 'but for
a while there I was feeling pretty glum. It was one of the worst days in my
life.'
The storm did about Dollars 250,000 worth of damage. The insurance covered
everything, but the repairs took so long that the range did not reopen until
April.
Since then, business has been good, says Cohen, thanks to publicity from
local newspapers, magazines and television stations. Word-of-mouth also
spread quickly, particularly among the financial community on Wall Street.
A 20ft-by-10ft billboard erected where Pier 25 meets the West Side Highway
(the main artery that runs along the river on Manhattan's west side)
attracts the attention of passing motorists.
Weekends are busiest, followed by weekdays between 4pm and 10pm. There is
also a steady lunchtime crowd, and the range is already attracting regulars.
'We have guys who come here twice a day, every day,' says Cohen.
The economics of the driving range are fairly simple. It has 24 stalls - a
dozen on each of two levels. Balls are sold for Dollars 6, Dollars 9 or
Dollars 12 a bucket. (This is considerably more than ranges outside the city
charge. But overheads are higher in Manhattan and the fact that the range is
the only one on the island, allows for more expensive rates.)
On average, customers have been paying Dollars 10 for a bucket, and Cohen
estimates that each stall can bring in about Dollars 30 per hour when the
range is busy. That means that on a good day, with 16 of the 24 stalls in
use for six hours, the range can generate upwards of Dollars 3,000 in cash.
That, however, is at the weekend. The place is much less busy on a dreary
Tuesday afternoon.
Cohen and Braunstein are heavily dependent upon the weather. New York is
pleasantly warm or unpleasantly hot for about 5 1/2 months of the year -
from mid-April through to the end of September. Although (unlike many other
driving ranges) the Manhattan Golf Club does not shut down for the winter -
the stalls can be heated and players are sheltered from the rain - driving
ranges are inescapably a seasonal attraction.
'People just do not think of going to a range if it's cold and wet outside,'
says Cohen. This summer, they have also had to contend with the extreme heat
and humidity, and a prolonged heatwave in July kept the number of visitors
down.
Although the two owners are shy about revealing all their financial details,
it is clear that more than Dollars 1m was spent on the driving range. The
money came from Cohen's father, a doctor, and a friend of his, a Californian
businessman.
They will have to be patient investors, because Cohen and Braunstein believe
it will take up to two years before the range begins to break even.
They are not entirely sure, though. 'No one has ever done something like
this before,' says Cohen.
Ultimately, both are confident the driving range will be a success. As Cohen
explains: 'Manhattan has millions of people, and there are only 24 stalls in
our range. The numbers have to make sense. 'Once they know about this place,
they have to come.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: New challenges for BES investors -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu surveys the options as the deadline for abolition
draws nearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESS expansion scheme is posing investors new challenges. Those
spurred to put in money before the BES is abolished on December 31 have two
main choices: a fixed price return or a variable rate linked to a rise in
the FT-SE 100 index.
The annual amount that can be invested in a BES by one person is Pounds
40,000 but a married couple can put in Pounds 80,000. The money can be
spread among a number of schemes. Tax relief is given at the investor's
marginal rate so long as the shares are held for five years; thus, a
higher-rate taxpayer parts with only Pounds 24,000 for a Pounds 40,000
investment.
There are a few trading company schemes around but the BES market is
dominated by assured tenancies. Most of these fund student accommodation. To
solve the problem of finding buyers for shares after five years, sponsors
often get the institution for which the money is being raised to commit
itself to buying them.
What, though, if the institution does not have enough money for this? The
buy-back promise is often reinforced through cash backing (setting aside a
sum of money which will accrue with compound interest to reach the exit
price after five years for all the shareholders) or a bank guarantee.
'Arranged exit' schemes now dominate the market. Of those still open,
Nationwide Aegis offers an exit price of 117.5p for every 100p invested,
which represents an annual return of 13.5 per cent to a higher-rate
taxpayer. Anglia Residences and Homemaker do even better, with 123p; this
equates to an annual return of 14 per cent.
(Investors should note that the annual returns depend on the sponsors
sending out the BES 3 certificates, which enable investors to claim tax
relief, in time for them to get their full rebate in that particular year. A
delay will result in lower annual returns).
The fixed returns on offer are historically high for the BES - but will they
continue? Nick Percival, director of BESt Investment, believes not. 'We are
seeing prices peak at the moment, but it cannot last because of the fall in
interest rates. Those purchasing five-year money for the cash-backed schemes
will not be able to offer such high returns from now on.'
Percival says the supply of schemes is also greater than demand because of
the requirement for BES companies to buy property with vacant possession. He
expects demand to overtake supply after October when the universities will
be out of the market (unless they are funding new buildings), but this is
when the building societies may enter to off-load their repossessed
properties.
Of the arranged exit cash-backed schemes still open, David Harris - of
Chantrey Financial Services, an independent adviser - recommends Close
Brothers' BESSA Oxford Fixed Return and Accumulus King's (Cambridge),
sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital. 'Both pay 120p after five years, equating
to an annual return of 13.6 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer.'
While both schemes are cash-backed fully, Harris warns: 'It would be a
mistake for people to think there is no risk at all, although I believe
these schemes to be very low risk.'
The other option is the innovatory stock market-linked schemes, of which two
are open: Close Brothers' BESSA Oxford and Matrix Securities Stock market
BES. Since there is no capital gains tax to pay on the disposal of a BES
company's shares, this is a way of investing in the stock market without
facing a CGT bill. But this tax break exists already through a Pep, which
gives investors greater flexibility since they are not constrained by a
five-year timetable.
The lump sum investment through the BES is higher than for a Pep, but this
might not be a good thing given the present stock market high. In any case,
the annual maximum for a Pep investment of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 in a
general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company version) builds up to a
total investment of Pounds 45,000 over five years - with the further
advantage of being staggered.
Still, the wealthy investor who already has a Pep and a fully-funded
pension, and believes the stock market will rise enough over five years to
give a good return, can consider these schemes. Best BES Advice, published
by the Allenbridge group, says: 'These deals are illiquid. In a market as
volatile as equities, this is a serious drawback.'
It prefers the Matrix Securities scheme which offers automatic 'lock-ins' at
60 per cent and 90 per cent of FT-SE growth to protect gains against the
danger of a fall in the market near the end of the five-year period. Matrix
also guarantees a fixed return of 75p compared with 60p for Close Brothers'
BESSA Oxford. But, as Allenbridge notes, the cost of the guarantee reduces
the potential return.
The advantage of a BES Footsie-linked return, compared with a building
society guaranteed equity bond, is the tax relief. Instead of costing the
investor Pounds 1, it is costing him only 60p; hence the potential for
higher returns.
Investors, however, should take independent financial advice and remember
that it is rarely a good idea to make an investment solely on the grounds of
tax efficiency.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Dispute drags on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY-OUTS from the Investors Compensation Scheme have been a mixed blessing
for 17 people who lost money with failed financial adviser Denis
Dale-Greaves. Ever since they received the money, they have been pursued by
Toby Micklethwait, an accountant who claims he is owed 10 per cent on a
contingency fee basis under contracts which investors signed with him. He
issued a writ last October and the case reached a pre-trial review before a
judge in chambers at Plymouth County Court on July 28.
Acting for himself, Micklethwait had 14 days to amend the drafting of his
claim, which sought fees of Pounds 29,300 plus Pounds 2,000 for 'time wasted
as a result of non-payment' - a concept unknown in English law. Lawyers
estimate that the full hearing probably will not get under way until the
beginning of next year.
Micklethwait said he filed an amended claim on Thursday but was unsure if he
had met the deadline. He said the claim was longer, and spelt out more
precisely what his contract had been. 'It will go to court unless a sensible
settlement is proposed, but I will settle for less than the full amount
because I am a nice chap - it came out easier than I expected.'
The ICS paid a total of Pounds 1.6m to 109 investors who lost money through
Denis Dale-Greaves. But the scheme initially told some of the investors -
including the 17 now being sued - that, on the evidence available, its rules
would not allow compensation to be paid to them. This was because their
money had gone into fake 'bonds' issued by Dale-Greaves between December 18
1986 (the date when investment business was first defined legally) and
August 28 1988 (when cover against bad advice became available from the
ICS).
The ICS said issuing fake bonds could not constitute investment business but
had to be treated as bad advice, not covered at the time. However, the ICS
offered the investors further personal interviews to discuss details of
their cases.
Three days before the interviews, the investors had a meeting with
Micklethwait and agreed he would attempt to recover money for them. The
exact terms of this agreement are in dispute. He says the wording of the
contract entitles him to 10 per cent of money recovered from whatever
source. But Clive Lambert, of the Plymouth-based firm Lamberts, which acts
for the 17, says his clients' understanding was that Micklethwait would
receive only 10 per cent of any money he recovered over and above anything
the ICS agreed to pay. He says Micklethwait acknowledged this in a letter to
the ICS.
Other points at issue are the amount of work actually done by Micklethwait
and whether he had any influence on the ICS payments made to the investors
in February and March 1992. 'I anticipated a two-year slop and was planning
and moving accordingly,' said Micklethwait; 'I did a lot on the telephone
and a certain amount face to face, but I don't have a lot of records to
prove all the 'phone calls and I didn't keep time sheets.'
Lambert said his clients felt that Micklethwait had not done anything on
their behalf: 'The meeting with him was on a Friday, they went to the ICS
interviews the following Monday and Tuesday, and got compensation several
administrative months later.'
He added that Micklethwait could not claim under his contract for any work
done on the Dale-Greaves case in a general way before the meeting as that
would amount to past consideration, which is no consideration in law.
Lambert also noted that the ICS had written - in a reply to his query about
the involvement of Micklethwait in his clients' cases - that the scheme had
'no correspondence or reference from Micklethwait specific to their claims.'
The 17 investors may have to seek legal aid if and when the case gets to
court, Lambert adds. But the compensation payments will have taken some
beyond the capital limits for legal aid.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Aggressive approach pays - Unit
trusts / Schroder UK Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHRODER UK Enterprise is a fund with a deliberately aggressive approach.
Founded in July 1988, and run since the start by Jim Cox, it holds only
40-45 stocks - those which it believes have the best prospects for growth.
This puts a premium on Cox's stock-selecting skills.
He emphasises that Schroder's approach is heavily research-orientated, with
close links between the group's analysts and its fund managers. 'Our overall
rule is that there aren't any rules - no black boxes or magic formulae which
have the secret of successful stock-picking,' he says. 'But, with careful
research, it is possible to tilt the odds in your favour.'
Cox feels management change at a company often presents an investment
opportunity: 'Change inside a company means that shares may be mis-priced.'
He points to the leisure group Granada when Gerry Robinson, formerly of the
Compass Group, took over shortly after a Pounds 163m rights issue. 'The
business had too much debt but the shares had considerable value at the
rights issue price.'
UK Enterprise also has a core of large growth companies such as Cable &amp;
Wireless or Reuters, and some 'recovery' stocks. This eclectic approach
indicates that Cox does not fit neatly into the 'growth' or 'value' schools
of investing. 'We are just looking for stocks which are cheap,' he says.
Over the past year, the fund has had a heavy emphasis on the financial
sector, particularly in banks, insurance companies and merchant banks. 'We
believe the financials will benefit from falling interest rates and a
reduction in the bad debt problem, plus a sharp improvement in the insurance
cycle,' says Cox.
The concentration on financials stands out when you look at the fund's top
10 stocks: GRE (the biggest holding), Schroders, Kleinwort Benson, TSB,
London &amp; Manchester, Cable &amp; Wireless, National Westminster bank, British
Airways, Legal &amp; General, and Sedgwick.
Cox believes GRE has been undervalued by the market. After a dividend cut,
he says, the shares yield 5 per cent with prospects for growth, especially
if the insurance cycle rebounds.
British Airways is one of the fund's non-financial stocks, and Cox points
out that the company is in a growing industry with the balance of supply and
demand moving in its favour.
'Airlines have not been making much money in recent years but BA has made
more than most,' he says, adding that the shares look attractive on a
price-to-cash flow basis.
As the fund grows - it is now Pounds 115m compared with Pounds 100,000 at
launch - there is an inevitable tendency for Cox to acquire more stocks. But
this is not a trend he wants to see develop too far since, as he puts it: 'I
don't want to dilute the effect of each individual bet.'
Some bets go wrong; one was a holding in Ratners, the jewellery retailer,
where the financial problems proved worse than Cox thought. But, overall,
the fund's performance figures are extremely impressive. It is top of the UK
equity growth sector over the five years to August 1, with growth of 146.85
per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested: source Micropal).
Over three years, it is second (out of 136) in the sector with growth of
69.95 per cent. In the past year, it is 10th (out of 145), giving investors
a return of 45.4 per cent. No other fund in the sector can match UK
Enterprise's achievement of being in the top decile (10 per cent) of funds
over one, three and five years.
Cox is optimistic about the prospects for UK shares. He believes the key is
interest rates and argues that, when they come down, equity markets tend to
rise. With very little inflation in the system, bond markets are reaching
new highs; that also aids the outlook for share prices.
Charges
Schroder says it is increasing the annual charge on the fund from 1 to 1.5
per cent 'to bring the charge in line with the rest of the industry'. The
initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the bid-offer spread is 6.25 per cent.
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 25 a month. The trust is
Pepable at no extra charge, although the minimum monthly Pep investment is
Pounds 50. The fund is run for growth, rather than income, and has a yield
of 2.24 per cent at present.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: The pensions manager and the pudding
. . . - Scheherazade Daneshkhu digests an ombudsman's report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONS can inflame passions. One complaint last year to the pensions
ombudsman, who arbitrates in disputes, was from a woman who had written 14
times to the trustees of her late husband's scheme.
She was angry over the delay in paying her a widow's pension. But she had
failed to tell the trustees he had died and had sent the letters to the
wrong address, anyway. Happy to make amends, the pensions manager invited
her to the pensioners' Christmas party and arranged her transport - only to
see his kindness repaid by the woman throwing her Christmas pudding and
custard at him.
Hers was one of the 2,166 complaints received by Michael Platt, the pensions
ombudsman, last year and described in his annual report for 1992, published
this week. The scheme was established in 1991 to investigate complaints of
injustice due to alleged maladministration by the trustees or managers of an
occupational or personal pension scheme, and to arbitrate on disputes of
fact or law with the trustees.
If you have a complaint, you should first try to sort it out with the
trustees or managers of your pension scheme. Failing that, write to the
Occupational Pensions Advisory Service. If OPAS cannot solve the problem, it
will forward the complaint to the pensions ombudsman. (The insurance
ombudsman deals with complaints about personal pensions).
Last year, Platt referred almost 40 per cent of complaints received to OPAS,
since they had not been sent there first. About 27 per cent fell outside his
jurisdiction. In another 28 per cent, an investigation was not carried out
because of lack of evidence of maladministration or because transfer values,
while low, were correct. And some complaints fell outside the prescribed
time limit.
For these reasons, Platt was able to resolve only 59 of the complaints he
received last year - but the great majority of these went in favour of
complainants. He found wholly in their favour in 27 cases, and in part in
another 19 cases. This is an increase on the previous year - the first year
of the scheme - when he upheld 22 cases wholly or in part in favour of the
complainant out of the 47 investigated. But Platt feels it is too soon to
say if last year's result was just a short-term blip.
The average investigation took 10 months compared with seven months the
previous year. Platt is unhappy about this and has set up a screening
procedure to let people know within weeks if their case will be
investigated.
Most complaints were about maladministration or transfer values, where
scheme operators delayed either giving a transfer quotation or making the
transfer payment.
In one case, a man left a private employer to join the public sector in
March 1990. It was not until December that the insurance company managing
his pension gave him a transfer quotation, despite his request for one in
June.
His new employer said that the quotation would give a service credit of 18
years if it received the transfer by April 1991. But it was not until June
1991 that the transfer was made and, under the rules of the new scheme, his
service credit had to be re-calculated down to 13 years.
Platt decided that the insurance company, which was aware of the April
deadline, had taken too long to make the transfer and directed it to pay an
additional transfer value to the new scheme to provide the complainant with
a service credit of 18 years. This amounted to Pounds 12,500. He also told
it to pay compensation of Pounds 200.
The highest compensation pay-out instructed last year was Pounds 2,800, but
most fell between Pounds 100-Pounds 250. The decisions of the ombudsman are
not binding, however, and two schemes refused to pay compensation.
Platt said many complaints came from a failure by pension schemes to tell
members clearly and simply about their rights. These included the options
open to member when leaving an employer.
Members should be vigilant and should not allow themselves to be fobbed off
with explanations they did not understand, he said. And they should keep all
documents to make it easier to resolve disputes.
OPAS 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB; the pensions ombudsman shares the
same address. The insurance ombudsman is at City Gate One, 135 Park Street,
London SE1 9EA.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Fixed interest investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERFORMANCE of fixed interest investments remains strong while still
being combined with good yields, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
Pibs
These are fixed interest-paying shares issued by building societies which
have proved popular with income-seeking private investors because yields are
higher than on gilts - a reflection of the correspondingly higher risk of
holding a security from a society rather than the government.
Early investors in Pibs were rewarded with higher yields than are available
now and have also enjoyed good capital performance. Yields have dropped as
prices have risen since we published the table last month. Iain Lindsay, of
stockbroker Hoare Govett, says: 'The Pibs market has continued its very
strong performance with prices rising by as much as 20 per cent in the past
eight weeks.
'The Halifax has broken through a 9 per cent yield with all other stocks,
with the exception of First National, now yielding under 10 per cent. The
First National Pibs has continued to outperform its peers, with the extra
demand causing its yield spread over the reference gilt to fall below 3 per
cent.'
UK bond funds
The three top-performing funds over the three years to August 1 (see table)
are all invested heavily in preference shares. These pay a fixed dividend
and rank ahead of ordinary shares in terms of dividend payment and capital
repayment in the event of a wind-up.
Abtrust, the top-performing trust over the period (according to Micropal),
changed its name last year from Abtrust Gilt &amp; Fixed Interest after it
eschewed gilts in favour of high-yielding convertible preference shares.
More than 70 per cent of the fund is invested in these, 12 per cent is in
preference shares, and the rest in corporate bonds. 'We are aiming for a
high yield from any fixed interest instrument,' says Paul Reed, the manager.
'So, we have built up high-yielding convertible stocks with an equity option
and these have performed well.'
He believes gilts are overpriced and has no plans to add them to the
portfolio at the moment. The fund has a 5.25 per cent initial charge and a 1
per cent annual, while the minimum investment is Pounds 500.
Gartmore Fund Managers is cutting the annual management fee on its
Preference Share unit trust from 1 to 0.5 per cent, and is offering a 2 per
cent bonus allocation of units to those who invest before October 1; this
will knock two percentage points off the initial charge of 5.25 per cent.
The fund has a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 and yields 8.2 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's two biggest insurance brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon are
expected to post pre-tax profits roughly the same level as last year when
they report interim results next week.
Sedgwick, reporting Tuesday, is expected to register pre-tax profits of
between Pounds 48m to Pounds 58m (compared with Pounds 51.7m last year),
while Willis, which reports on Thursday, is expected to make between Pounds
58m and Pounds 63m (Pounds 56.7m).
Difficulties in the US market, which remains competitive, are one of the
main factors holding back further improvement.
Meanwhile Argos, the catalogue retailer, is expected to benefit from the
elimination of losses from the ill-fated Chesterman furniture business when
it reports interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 14m on
Monday compared to Pounds 9.5m last time.
On Tuesday Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to announce
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 240m to Pounds 280m for the third quarter,
compared with Pounds 274m in the comparative year-ago period. The group has
been hit by the strike at Peabody Coal in the US which has cost it about
Pounds 30m. However, the stronger dollar is expected to benefit it by a
similar amount since more than half its profits are generated in North
America.
BICC, the cables and construction group, is expected to report a fall in
half year profits, from Pounds 58m to around Pounds 53m on Wednesday and on
Thursday Wickes, the DIY group, is expected to show a 35 per cent
improvement to about Pounds 3.5m when it reports its interim pre-tax
results.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Sellers continue to set the pace -
Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT BE high summer, but directors are not taking a break from trading.
Selling still outweighs buying but there has been increased activity across
the board.
Christopher Broadbent, the managing director of BWD Securities, a
stockbroking company, sold more than 1m shares at 97.2p. At the beginning of
the year, they were trading around 40p; now, they are about 100p.
The sale by Johnson Wallace of shares in Willis Corroon, an insurance and
re-insurance broker, was technically made during the company's closed period
in anticipation of interim results. In a statement to the Stock Exchange,
though, the company explained the transaction had been carried out by
trustees acting for Wallace. Despite instructions in June to deal, the sale
was not made until recently.
Activity on the buying front ranges from industrial giants to companies with
market capitalisations of just over Pounds 10m. Ross Group is involved in a
variety of industrial services. After an up-beat AGM statement, six board
members invested in shares at 26p. This marks the first dealing in the
company by directors for several years. Sir Michael Edwardes, the chairman
of Charter Consolidated, has increased his holding by 20,000 shares.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Put a premium on possessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STUDENTS may be impoverished but many still have items of interest to
burglars: stereos, televisions, watches, jewellery, cameras or personal
computers. Insurance can seem an unnecessary expense, but habits such as
leaving doors unlocked and living in shared houses make students easy
targets for opportunistic thieves, and many insurers refuse to cover them.
As a student, probably the cheapest way to insure your belongings is if your
hall of residence has a block policy; ask if it does. The next cheapest is
to use your parents' home contents insurance, which often covers items
'temporarily removed' to another place. But cover could be restricted so
check the details. Extending the policy could be better, but some insurers
will no longer do this.
The other, more expensive, solution is to buy student possessions insurance.
National Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds sell a policy from Norwich Union
via Harrison-Beaumont, while Midland and the Bank of Scotland have their own
insurance. Endsleigh Insurance, which has branches near most universities,
also has a policy.
Rooms in halls of residence generally are cheaper to insure than rooms in
non-university accommodation. The Norwich Union charges Pounds 28.50 for
Pounds 2,000 cover in halls anywhere in the UK, the Bank of Scotland charges
Pounds 37.50, and Endsleigh Pounds 27.
Rates for rooms elsewhere depend on your postcode. Students in inner cities
could pay twice as much as small-town students. With the Norwich, Pounds
2,000 cover in the cheapest district costs Pounds 40 and Pounds 82 in the
most expensive.
The Bank of Scotland charges from Pounds 43.75 to Pounds 82 and Endsleigh
ranges from Pounds 35 to Pounds 99. The Midland charges between Pounds 51.75
and Pounds 162.15 for Pounds 2,750 cover.
Policies do not all cover the same things: exclusions vary; replacement can
be new for old or second-hand value only; and there can be other benefits -
such as loss or damage to library books and college property, which is
covered under the Endsleigh policy. All-risks cover for personal items taken
out of your room sometimes costs extra.
One point to watch is whether theft is excluded unless there is evidence of
forcible entry (this does not cover theft by flatmates or strangers
wandering through an open door). Endsleigh does not specify forcible entry
but Norwich does.
All policies have a limit for individual items - if this is too low for your
computer, or other valuables, you can usually increase the cover.
Student bicycles are an even worse risk. Endsleigh cannot insure them at
present but hopes to have a policy again by the start of the academic year.
The Norwich policy includes bicycles for an extra premium of 17.5 per cent
of the machine's value, with a minimum premium of Pounds 24 and a maximum
insurable value of Pounds 300.
Again, a cheaper option could be to include it on all-risks cover under your
parents' policy. Commercial Union charges between Pounds 10 and Pounds 40
(depending on postcode) for Pounds 1,000 of all-risks cover as a policy
extension. The individual item limit is 25 per cent of the sum insured, up
to a maximum of Pounds 500.
So, a bicycle worth Pounds 250 could be insured for as little as Pounds 10,
along with Pounds 750 of other goods.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Pep offers 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW personal equity plan offering a tax-free income of 10 per cent has
been launched by fund management group John Govett. The fund, which is an
authorised unit trust, will invest in UK equities and government bonds
issued by overseas countries.
The equity portion - which will have to be at least 50 per cent to qualify
for Pep rules - will yield between 5.2 and 5.7 per cent. That puts a heavy
burden on the bond portion of the portfolio to provide the bulk of the
income.
Accordingly, the fund will venture into markets such as Turkey, where bonds
yield between 65 and 70 per cent.
There is obviously a risk attached with any bond which yields this much  -
and the risk in this case is currency depreciation. A fall in the Turkish
lira could wipe out all of the extra interest earned by the fund once the
proceeds are translated back into British pounds.
The consequence for investors is that there is a chance of capital loss if
the fund managers miscalculate. Simon Osborne, who will manage the bond
element, says he will invest initially in Mexico, Turkey, South Africa,
Spain and Italy.
Judging by the success of Foreign &amp; Colonial's futures-based Pep, which
raised Pounds 250m, any product yielding 10 per cent is likely to arouse a
lot of interest from investors in present conditions. But the Govett fund,
while easier to understand than F &amp; C's - which earns income from option
premiums - is probably higher risk.
It is tempting to believe that there must be an easy way of earning 10 per
cent income but, with base rates at 6 per cent and long gilt yields at 7.5
per cent, this is not the case.
The bond portion of the portfolio is likely to suffer capital loss and the
equity portion will have to grow to compensate for this. Given that UK
equities are at an all-time high, there is a real chance this might not
happen.
Nevertheless, there will be some investors who are so attracted by the
income that they will be willing to risk capital loss. For a top-rate
taxpayer, a 10 per cent income in a Pep equates to 16.67 per cent from a
building society.
Charges will be 5 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual. There is no
additional charge for the Pep. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and
the maximum, for Pep investors, is Pounds 6,000.
Income payments will be made monthly to investors' bank and building society
accounts. On a full Pounds 6,000 investment, the return would be Pounds 50 a
month.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Society axes endowments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society surprised analysts and the
financial services industry by announcing this week that it is to stop
selling not only endowment mortgages but also all other insurance-related
products.
Banks and building societies have been moving inexorably towards a
supermarket approach to selling a wide range of financial products, such as
pensions and life insurance. The idea, known as 'bancassurance,' has become
common currency in the industry.
Banks and societies foresee a boost to their income from commission on such
sales. Some societies - such as Britannia, National &amp; Provincial and
Woolwich - have made an expensive investment by setting up their own life
companies which should, in the long run, prove more profitable than 'tying'
(ie, having an exclusive distribution) with a single life office.
What is wrong with trying to increase income by providing a wide range of
products (with the added virtue of convenience, since they are available on
the high street)? Nothing, in principle. But the problem is that by tying to
a single life office, customers must buy the products of that provider
regardless of how they have performed or whether they meet the client's
needs.
Moreover, consumer bodies (such as the Consumers' Association) have
concluded that some products, particularly endowment mortgages, are oversold
because of the commission they generate.
Anthony Nelson, economics secretary to the Treasury, has become alarmed by
the high lapse rates in the life industry. Last month, he ordered the
regulators to draft rules obliging both tied agents and independent
financial advisers to disclose how much commission they get when they
recommend a product.
This is expected to make endowment mortgages - where an equity-linked,
long-term savings plan is taken out to pay off the mortgage - even less
attractive than before.
'Societies are realising that bancassurance is not a guaranteed route to
riches,' says the CA's Jean Eaglesham. 'It is another nail in the coffin of
endowment mortgages.'
C &amp; G says that once its five-year tied agreement with Legal &amp; General ends
in November, it will not seek a tie with any other life office or set up its
own. Customers who want insurance-related products will be referred to local
IFAs, who are responsible for referring roughly 60 per cent of C &amp; G's
existing mortgage clients.
The society showed its disenchantment with endowments three years ago when
it announced it would concentrate on interest-only and repayment mortgages.
With the former, the choice of how to pay off the capital is left to the
borrower. Andrew Longhurst, C &amp; G's chief executive, says: 'Endowment
mortgages are not automatically in the customer's best interests.'
Endowments now account for only 8.3 per cent of C &amp; G's new mortgage sales,
compared with an industry average of 69 per cent. This has meant lower
commission income compared with the other top 10 building societies, much of
which is eaten up by the costs of selling the products. C &amp; G says this is
expected to increase with the introduction of more rigorous training
standards for insurance salesmen.
The society's low cost-to-income ratio means it relies less on bancassurance
for its income than comparable rivals - and, thus, can do without it more
easily. C &amp; G also has been helped by its low overheads: it has the lowest
number of branches of any top 10 society except Bristol &amp; West.
Instead, it has built up a postal banking service and much of its
deposit-taking is in the form of postal accounts. It has courted the
wealthier older investor, both as saver and borrower.
Others, tied into the bancassurance strategy, will find it difficult to
change tack and are unlikely to follow. But as Patrick Frazer, of consultant
DIBC (and author of Morgan Grenfell's annual report on building societies),
says: 'C &amp; G looks as if it will be on the side of the angels while the
other building societies find themselves in the position of having to defend
what is increasingly seen as a rip-off product.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Don't take college life for granted
 -Education is an expensive business. Bethan Hutton guides new students
through the financial maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY NEW student is bombarded with offers of bank accounts, but there is
more to student finance than cashcards and overdraft limits.
Students these days have to juggle grants, parental contributions and loans,
as well as any sponsorship they are lucky enough to get. Income tax can
complicate the picture, while some unwary students can end up paying council
tax.
A bank account is still a first-year student's most urgent requirement. If
you are looking for incentives, the free gifts available this year range
from the TSB's four cinema tickets, a clutch of discount vouchers and a free
driving lesson, to a more straightforward Pounds 25 cash credit from
NatWest. The Royal Bank of Scotland will give you Pounds 10, Lloyds is
offering a free student rail card, and Barclays has a Pounds 10 Our Price
music voucher. Midland will credit Pounds 25 to accounts opened before
September 30, and Pounds 15 after that. The Bank of Scotland has declared a
policy of 'no hype, no bribes, just better banking'.
Most now insist on receiving your grant or maintenance cheque before handing
over the bribe, so the days of doing the rounds and collecting every freebie
appear to be over.
All the big clearing banks offer students interest-free overdrafts up to
Pounds 400, together with cash card, debit card and cheque book - but that
does not mean all the accounts are the same.
The Royal Bank of Scotland's Pounds 400 overdraft is free only for the first
year of study; after that interest is charged at 1 per cent over the base
rate. At the other main banks, overdrafts up to Pounds 400 remain free as
long as you are still studying. NatWest will increase the free overdraft
limit to Pounds 500 for your final year.
If you think you are about to exceed your arranged limit, get your bank's
agreement before you do. The interest charged on unauthorised overdrafts is
very high, and you may also have to pay for bounced cheques and letters
informing you of your overdraft.
First-year students who already have a bank account should check whether
their bank will extend its free gifts and special terms to existing
customers. If not, it could be worth opening another account elsewhere.
The Co-operative Bank does not treat students any differently from other
customers, which means no free overdrafts or gifts, but its ethical stance
still attracts environmentally-aware students who object to the fur trade,
tobacco companies, animal experimentation and so on.
The Halifax is one of the few building societies which welcome students as
current account customers. There are no sweeteners attached to its Maxim
student/young worker package, but it does offer an interest-free overdraft
up to Pounds 300, and interest on credit balances of 4.25 per cent gross, as
well as the usual cash/debit card and cheque book.
Most bank accounts pay interest on credit balances, but often at very low
rates. The Royal Bank of Scotland pays 0.25 per cent on balances up to
Pounds 1,000, Lloyds and Barclays pay 1 per cent gross, and NatWest pays 2
per cent. If you think you can keep your account in credit much of the time,
then the TSB or the Bank of Scotland, which pay 4 per cent gross, or the
Midland, which pays 3 per cent gross, might be a better bet.
If you have more substantial savings, perhaps accumulated from work during a
year off, a separate building society account could be worthwhile. Check
which ones offer the best rates, and if you are a non-tax payer, remember to
fill in the form to have interest paid without deduction of tax.
Your bank may offer you a credit card - Barclays even encourages you to
apply for one with an extra music voucher or other gift. A credit card can
provide useful flexibility in how and when you pay for things, but it is
also an easy way to get into debt very quickly. If you do not pay off your
balance every month you will be charged far more interest than on a student
overdraft. Make sure that any card you apply for does not charge students an
annual fee.
Student grants in the UK have been frozen since 1990, at Pounds 2,265 a year
in most parts of the country, Pounds 2,845 in London, and Pounds 1,795 for
students living with their parents. Grants are means tested, so more and
more parents are obliged to pay part of their children's maintenance, though
not all manage to do this. Students are no longer able to claim housing
benefit, or income support during vacations.
To make up the shortfall most students experience, the government operates a
student loan scheme, through the Student Loans Company, which charges very
low rates of interest: 1.2 per cent for 1993-94, down from 3.9 per cent for
1992-93. You do not start repaying the loans until the April after you
graduate. If your earnings are low, repayment can be deferred.
Final year students this year can borrow Pounds 685 in London, Pounds 585
elsewhere, and Pounds 470 if they live with their parents. Students at an
earlier stage in their courses can borrow Pounds 940 in London, Pounds 800
elsewhere, and Pounds 640 if they live with their parents. You can apply for
a loan at any time in the academic year, but you can only get one loan a
year. Applications have to be made through your university or college, which
will certify your eligibility. The loan can be paid in up to three
instalments.
If you think you are likely to need a loan - 46 per cent of students did
last year, according to a Barclays survey - it could be worthwhile applying
at the beginning of the academic year, before you really need the money, and
putting it in a deposit account to earn some interest. Only do this if you
have the willpower not to spend all the money at once, or alternatively pick
an account where you have to give a month or two's notice before making
withdrawals.
The government provides a little extra help for students in dire financial
straits, in the form of access funds administered by each university or
college. To get any money from the access fund, a student has to prove he or
she is suffering severe financial hardship, and has exhausted other sources
of funds. The amount of money available is so limited, and demand is so
high, that many institutions run out before the end of the academic year, so
access funds cannot be relied on as a last resort. Students at wealthier
institutions, such as Oxbridge colleges, may be able to tap into other
hardship funds or bursaries.
Income tax is not a subject that most students think much about, but it does
occasionally crop up. The typical student is entitled to the single person's
tax allowance of Pounds 3,445. Grants and parental contributions do not
count as taxable income, but holiday earnings and some forms of sponsorship
do. However, very few students will earn more than Pounds 3,445 on top of
their maintenance, so if you get a holiday job, ask your employer for form
P38(S), to make sure your pay will not have tax deducted at source. The
Inland Revenue has a leaflet, 'Income tax and students' (IR60), which
explains how tax can affect you.
Council tax is something else most students should not have to pay, but if
you are not careful about your living arrangements, you could end up having
to. Buildings or houses occupied solely by students are exempt from the tax,
but if you live in a bedsit, where there are other bedsits in the building
occupied by non-students, the landlord could be liable for council tax on
the tenants' behalf, and pass the cost on to you through the rent.
Also, if you share a house or flat with non-students, the property will not
be exempt. The amount of council tax due will depend on how many
non-students live there, but students are not personally exempt and it is up
to the occupants how they split up the bill: your flatmates may insist that
you pay your share. Check on the council tax position before you commit
yourself to living somewhere.
In spite of their lack of money, students are sometimes targeted by
companies selling life insurance. It is hard to see why a single student
with no dependants should need life insurance so, if you are approached by a
salesperson, treat them with the utmost scepticism.

INSURANCE companies this week provided the City with profit figures for the
first half indicating that the sector is on the way to recovery after its
losses of the last three years.
General Accident and Royal Insurance - both of which have seen three years
of heavy losses - reported their first profits since 1989, while Commercial
Union, which clawed its way back into the black last year, posted further
improvement on Wednesday.
Two other composites Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance, look set to
continue the trend when they report in the next few weeks.
An improvement in trading conditions has helped the sector. John Chester,
analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'Everything which is key to the fortunes of
insurers is positive. The companies are flying.'
Costs have been cut; claims from theft, mortgage indemnity, subsidence and
storm damage have declined or levelled off; and growth in the equity and
bond markets is strengthening balance sheets.
Above all insurers are reaping the benefits of premium rate increases in the
home and motor insurance markets, with consumers paying increases of an
average 20 per cent per year in 1991 and 1992.
Although market reaction this week was mixed - GA and CU both rose while
Royal fell - each company's price has risen strongly in the past 18 months.
The composite insurance index has outperformed the FT-A All Share Index by
36 per cent since March 1992.
Industry leaders believe that positive trading conditions will continue for
the next few years. While rates for personal lines business are seen as
adequate, commercial buyers still face increases. Both CU and Royal forecast
this week that falling returns from investments were putting more pressure
on them to underwrite business more profitably.
Following billions of pounds of losses from catastrophes in recent years,
the cheap reinsurance capacity, which helped fuel rate competition in the
1980s, is no longer available.
Indeed European reinsurers are pressing direct insurers to increase rates,
reducing the chance of competition.
Analysts such as David Hudson, of Credit Lyonnais Laing, believe trading
conditions will translate into further upward movement in share prices.
'The industry has entered a period of profitability the likes of which we
haven't seen for years,' said Hudson, who is expecting a further 10 per cent
outperformance by insurance shares before the sector reaches its peak.
Shortages of capital will restrict competition in the UK, and UK insurers
are also well placed to benefit from a strengthening in the US and European
markets. 'The UK has firmed up in isolation. We are now seeing the first
signs of rates hardening in other direct markets,' said Hudson, who said
insurance companies may be able to obtain returns on capital of more than 20
per cent in the next few years.
Other analysts strike a more cautious note. Chester says the sector is
standing on a historic high relative to net assets, with most of the shares
trading at a substantial premium. 'Long term investors must remain
cautious,' says Chester, 'share prices have rarely traded at premiums to
NAVs and when they have, poor share price performance has invariably
followed.'
Shares of some of the most successful US insurers have reached prices
equivalent to 200 per cent of NAV but Warburg believes there is little
chance that UK insurers will follow suit.
Chester says that such US companies have a proven record of achieving
underwriting profits, while this is a relatively new phenomena for UK
companies. who have traditionally made money mainly from their investments.
In addition insurance companies may not be so immune to competition as they
would like to believe. Some analysts stress the potential inroads that
rapidly growing low cost producers such as Direct Line and Churchill might
still make in the market. Nor, following recent falls in yields, will
dividends offer much support to prices. 'We are about to peak,' says Youseef
Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley. 'Most of the recovery is already
discounted.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: The logic behind the euphoria - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a week of euphoria in the stock market. The Footsie passed the
3,000 mark with a 34.5 point surge on Wednesday, and managed to keep above
that level for the rest of the week. On four days out of five the index
closed at a new high. The gilt run has also continued.
A wobble on Friday, taking the index below 3,000 again, was reversed before
the close with the Footsie eventually rising 1 point on the day to close at
3010.1. This suggests a firm underpinning for the market, even at these
dizzy heights.
The motivation for the market has been the prospect of yet lower UK interest
rates, and a hastened recovery in the economies of continental Europe
following the near break down of the ERM, to which over 60 per cent of UK
exports are sent.
That has underpinned corporate earnings forecasts, and for the first time in
some years brokers are expecting to use the next results reporting season as
a time to raise rather than lower their estimates for the following year.
The most bullish of the leading houses, Nomura Research Institute, which has
a forecast of 3,500 for the Footsie by the year end, argues that this
represents a 1994 p/e of 'only' 15.3, which it regards as reasonable at this
stage of the economic cycle.
There is nothing magic about 1,000 steps in the market. But as the chart
shows, each time the Footsie has gone past such a milestone it has been at a
higher and higher p/e, showing that earnings are not running up with the
index. The break through 2,000 came towards the end of an economic cycle,
when earnings growth was slowing.
The yield on the market, however, is higher now than it was at the 2,000
level, as dividends have risen as a proportion of earnings.
Economic news has been somewhat mixed this week. While consumer borrowing
has continued to rise - suggesting growing degree of confidence - other
indicators have been less good.
Unemployment rose in July, for the first time since January. After months
when people could not understand why it was falling, a seasonally-adjusted
rise of just 200 should not be too much of a worry, and especially as it is
a difficult month to adjust for school and college leavers.
Manufacturing output fell quite sharply in June, down 2.1 per cent, more
than reversing May's rise of 1.8 per cent. However, in the three months to
June output rose 1.4 per cent on the previous three months, and 3.1 per cent
over the same three months last year, so the trend is still in the right
direction.
What is a touch worrying is the regional survey from the CBI this week,
which suggested recovery was faltering in a number of regions, generally
those which represent the country's manufacturing heartland.
This has been borne out by some UK companies. Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the
Manchester-based engineers, warned on Wednesday that its profits would fall
from its first half to the second because order books were actually lower
than they were a few months ago. J&amp;FB had been expecting orders to revive.
Meanwhile, BOC Group, the gases company, warned on Tuesday, that the
economic recovery in the rest of the world was not coming through as hoped.
BOC's news that its profits would be down in the year to September, on
Tuesday, may have single-handedly delayed the Footsie's rise through 3,000
for a day.
BOC said that recovery in the US had slowed, in Australia had stalled, and
that in the UK was having little effect on its business. Since around half
the profits of Footsie companies are made abroad, this is a serious concern.
It also explains why second line stocks have been outperforming the top ones
lately. These smaller companies generally have a much lower exposure to the
international economy.
News from the inflation front was generally good, though, and this is one of
the main supports for the gilt market, and to equities too.
The Bank of England's quarterly report on inflation suggested that it could
remain below the 4 per cent target for the next two years, which is about
the furthest horizon the markets can see.
Given that the Bank has to fund a Pounds 50bn budget deficit this year, it
may just be talking its own book. But it is a story that foreign buyers are
willing to believe, and the funding programme is so well advanced - 60 per
cent done in 4 1/2 months - that the Bank has been able to take a summer
holiday, announcing yesterday that there would not be another gilt auction
until the latter half of September.
Other corporate news has been cheering this week. British Airways shares
rose on its first quarter profits which showed a jump at the operating level
from Pounds 96m to Pounds 108m, although this was more than reversed on
pre-tax profits thanks to a higher interest charge. Passenger numbers
suggested a pick up in travel.
The benefits of sterling's devaluation to profits of UK based international
companies were demonstrated by Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare and consumer
group, where interim profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 82.3m pre-tax. But
the underlying growth rate was a lesser 8 per cent when currency gains and a
one-off profit on a disposal were excluded.
Unilever obligingly makes the underlying growth calculation easier by
reporting quarterly figures in constant exchange rates. On this basis second
quarter net profits were 8 per cent higher and would be 21 per cent up if
the currency benefit is taken into account.
Unilever, like BOC, said trading was patchy, in its case seeing a weaker
performance in the US and Europe. But it was confident enough to say the
first half performance would be maintained for the rest of the year.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: No time to start a wild bull chase - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 index surged through 3,000 this week, prompting reports on the
Nine O'Clock News and talk of a prolonged bull market with the index heading
swiftly for 3,500.
Regular readers will know that this column believes private investors have
an unfortunate tendency to buy when the market is high and sell when it is
low. So, is this one of the occasions when the wise private investor should
head for the exits?
The first point is that we should not get too excited when share indices hit
records. Over time, share prices have a tendency to rise, partly because of
economic growth and partly because of inflation. A new high does not
necessarily herald a fall.
The bull argument at the moment is interest rate related. Now that European
countries have been freed from the constraints of the exchange rate
mechanism, they can lower their interest rates. This will stimulate their
economies and provide a boost to British exports. It will also allow the UK
to cut its interest rates without worrying about a plunge in the pound. The
result should be increased growth at home.
Furthermore, this growth should occur in a period when inflation is not a
problem. That allows rates to stay low, both on short-term rates and
long-term bonds. So, with returns on the main alternative investments - cash
and bonds - both low, investors naturally are eager to put money into the
stock market. Hence, bulls argue, prices should keep rising.
Is there any need for caution? Two of the most fundamental measures of share
price valuation are the price-earnings ratio and the dividend yield. At
present, both of these make shares look expensive by historical standards.
The p/e ratio is the relationship between the share price and the proportion
of a company's profits attributable to an individual share. If its price is
100p and the most recently announced earnings per share were 10p, then the
p/e would be 10. An investor would have to pay the equivalent of 10 years'
profits to buy that share.
Broadly speaking, the higher the p/e ratio, the faster investors expect
profits to grow. If they are set to double, then a share trading on an
historic p/e of 20 is trading only on a prospective p/e of 10.
Talking recently to US fund manager Michael O'Higgins, whose high-yield,
low-price theory of stock picking I have described many times, I was struck
by his remark that 'people spend too much time looking at the outlook for
corporate earnings, and not enough at the p/e ratio.'
When the p/e is high, the market is at its most optimistic about prospects
for corporate earnings (and is likely to be disappointed); when the p/e is
low, the market is at its most pessimistic (and likely to be pleasantly
surprised).
I decided to test this by looking at the p/e on the FT-A 500 Index since
1965 (this happens to be the benchmark for which Datastream has the longest
series of information). The method was simple: compare the p/e at the start
of the year with the gain made by the index over the year.
Over the 28 years from 1965 to 1993, the p/e on January 1 varied between
4.02 in 1975 and 22.49 in 1969. I divided the 28 years in four batches,
ranging from the seven lowest to the seven highest, and then compared
average stock market returns for the four groups.
The results were not a smooth progression but were still fairly conclusive.
In the seven years when the p/e was at its lowest, the growth of the index
over the following year averaged 32.37 per cent. In the seven years when the
p/e was at its highest (above 14.23), the index subsequently grew by just
2.41 per cent.
Just in case this was a statistical fluke, I tested the theory on the 28
periods since 1965 starting August 1. Again, the result was clear. In the
periods when the p/e was low (below 9), the average return over the
subsequent year was 19.86 per cent; when it was high (above 14.5), the
return was minus 4.82 per cent.
There were three occasions when the p/e on the 500 index was over 20. In
each case, the market fell by more than 15 per cent over the following year.
In other words, it is a bad time to buy the market when the p/e is high. The
current p/e on the 500 index is 19.78.
Perhaps the past 28 years were unrepresentative, however, in that inflation
was high. Now it has fallen, bulls could argue that the valuations
appropriate in the high-inflation era are no longer relevant.
So, what about the dividend yield, now 3.71 per cent on the All-Share? BZW
has figures dating back to 1918, which cover years of both low and high
inflation. If contrarian theory is right, years when the dividend yield is
high should be followed by better market returns than years when the yield
is low.
Sure enough, when the yield was, like now, below 4 per cent, the average
rise in the index over the following year was 0.3 per cent. When the market
yielded over 5 per cent, returns averaged 15.8 per cent.
All this proves is you should buy low, not high. It does not mean you should
sell all your shares today - they are still the best long-term investment -
but it does indicate you should avoid chasing the market with new lump sums.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: University BES launch - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another FT-SE-linked Business Expansion Scheme has been launched, this time
by sponsors Hodgson Martin. The Balliol and Magdalen Companies seeks to
raise Pounds 20m through six BES companies to finance accommodation for
students and dons at the Oxford colleges. Investors have a choice of
returns. They can buy shares in the Gilt-Edged Companies offering 121p after
five years for every 100p invested (equating to an annual return of 14.1 per
cent to a higher rate taxpayer after five years) or in the FT-SE Companies.
The latter offers a minimum return of 60p plus a variable return based on a
return of 1.6p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 index. There are
automatic 'lock-ins' at rises of 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the index.
Hodgson Martin says that if the index rises by 50 per cent over the
investment period, the annual return to a higher-rate taxpayer will be 17.3
per cent compound. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. More BES on Page V

FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Banks taken to task - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The voluntary Code of Banking Practice, introduced last year and currently
under review, has been too limited, too flawed, and banks have been too slow
to implement it, the Consumers' Association said.
In a submission to the review committee, it said banks had adopted a
'parsimonious approach' to interpreting and applying the code, particularly
regarding services it did not specifically deal with, such as the
administration of wills. New areas which should be covered by the code
included advance notification of charges and interest, compensation for home
banking customers affected by fraud, and informing customers if their
savings accounts were superseded by new accounts paying higher interest
rates. The association warned that if standards of consumer protection did
not improve, a statutory alternative to the code would become essential.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: Waiting for the taxman to burst the bubble - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY after Congress approved President Clinton's budget and its hefty tax
increases for the rich, a big US mutual fund group placed full page
advertisements in newspapers offering investors free advice on how to shift
their money into tax-exempt funds.
In the first two days, hardly anyone took up the offer. The rich, it seems,
were either: a) perfectly happy to hand over more of their wealth to the
government to help reduce the deficit, b) casually indifferent to the impact
of higher taxes, or, c) too shell-shocked by the budget's implications to
react.
Of the three explanations, c) is probably nearest the truth. Under the
Clinton budget, the top marginal tax rate for individuals making more than
Dollars 115,000 a year in taxable income, and couples making more than
Dollars 140,000, rises from 31 per cent to 36 per cent. This is a big
increase in anyone's book, and one that is retroactive (backdated to January
1 this year) to boot.
History shows that spending and investment behaviour inevitably changes to
fit a new tax environment, and no one expects anything different this time
around. That there has been little evidence so far of individuals rushing to
shelter their income from higher taxes suggests that the rich (a category
which, as defined by the Clinton administration, is broader than one might
think) have not yet come to terms with the fact that they are going to be
less rich from now on.
Stock market investors seem to share this unwillingness to face the reality
of the Clinton budget. How else to explain why, week after week, share
prices have been following bond prices into record territory, yet one of the
main driving forces behind surging bond prices has been the expectation that
the President's deficit-reduction budget will hinder, not help, the US
economy?
In more normal times, the judgment of bond market economists that government
policies will retard economic growth, and presumably corporate earnings
growth as well, would depress equity market sentiment and show up in lower
share prices. Yet, stocks continue on their record-breaking course,
apparently untroubled by the bond market's gloomy prognosis of the economic
outlook. This week alone the Dow Jones Industrial Average twice set a new
record closing high.
Stock markets are performing so well because investors are more impressed by
record low interest rates - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell
below 6.4 per cent this week for the first time ever - than they are worried
about the immediate outlook for the economy. As long as low interest rates
keep diverting funds out of low-yielding short-term assets and into stocks,
and as long as low interest rates allow companies to raise fresh capital
cheaply, investors will keep buying equities.
The problem with this situation is that the markets are becoming
increasingly reliant upon favourable interest rates and expectations of
improving earnings. With share prices so high by historical standards -
stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index are trading at 23 times earnings -
an upturn in interest rates, or a failure of corporate earnings to meet
expectations (or both), could trigger a dramatic sell-off.
Admittedly, interest rates are unlikely to rise anytime soon. Only this
week, the July producer and consumer prices data showed that inflationary
pressures in the economy remain extremely weak. Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, may have warned recently that he is ready to tighten
monetary policy at the first sign of overheating in the economy, but with
inflation so low and output so sluggish, there seems little need for higher
rates in the foreseeable future.
The markets' hopes for corporate profitability, however, rest on shakier
ground. Over the past year the majority of companies have reported stronger
earnings more because they have been able to cut costs and boost
productivity, and less because they have raised prices of their goods and
services or enjoyed sharp growth in sales volume.
The improvements in productivity, however, may have peaked. This week the
government reported that average non-farm output per hour dropped 2.5 per
cent in the second quarter - the second straight three-monthly decline. More
worryingly, it was the largest fall in hourly output for more than four
years.
If productivity is really shrinking, then companies are going to have to
look elsewhere for earnings growth. This means they will have to raise
prices, or hope consumers start spending heavily again. In the current
economic climate, raising prices would not make much sense, because that
would only offset any benefits to be had from stronger consumer spending.

FT  14 AUG 93 / By coal barge through Europe's heart: Nicholas Woodsworth
took a slow boat up the Rhine and watched the castles, vineyards and great
industries roll past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Jan Veldman, somewhere on the Rhine River between Dusseldorf and
Cologne, told me he was hauling 1.5m kilos of coal, I began to realise I was
slightly out of my league. We were talking big boat here.
I could not actually see his barge, the Vecht; I was sitting in Bonn,
watching fat drops of rain hit car rooftops outside and chatting to Jan over
a scratchy radio-telephone link. Nor, in my mind's eye, could I visualise
that much coal. But the figure helped to put things in perspective.
I have a 17-metre narrowboat on London's Regent's canal and, as English
canal boats go, consider it large. I find, though, that just a couple of
bags of heating coal, 25 kilos or so, cut down considerably on my living
space in winter - I have to pile it under my galley table. But where on any
canal boat, for heaven's sake, can you pile 60,000 times that amount, 1.5m
kilos of the stuff, without it getting seriously underfoot? I was interested
to see what kind of craft the Vecht might be.
I did not hold my breath. The Vecht may be capacious, but no one has yet
built a coal barge for speed. The trip from Dusseldorf to Bonn by car takes
just one hour. Pushing a heavy cargo upstream at a stately rate of 9kph - a
brisk walking pace - the Vecht took 12 times as long. Slow boats would have
been in China sooner.
But Jan Veldman is nothing if not punctual. A few minutes before noon the
next day I was standing under quayside cranes at Grau Rheindorf, Bonn's
river port, where we had agreed on a mid-day rendezvous. The cranes dripped,
the sky drizzled. There was not a great deal to see. Some 300m across the
river I could make out the trees and flat green fields of the far bank.
Gurgling and sighing as it surged past the quay, the Rhine emerged upstream
from a dull grey mist, only to disappear back into it further down.
At precisely noon the square bows of a hull loomed into view and moved
slowly up-river alongside the quay. The bow of the boat passed me, a Montega
estate wagon parked on its foredeck. The low, narrow length of the barge
came on, and on - and kept on coming, a seemingly endless succession of
small hills of piled coal sliding by me. I tumbled aboard, the Vecht swung
back into the oncoming current, and we were away.
It seemed a long stroll to the raised wheelhouse and living quarters on the
stern of the barge. I now understood why Jan did not have to clutter up his
galley the way I did mine. The Vecht is just a shade under the length of a
full-size soccer pitch. You can put a lot of coal into a floating steel bin
4m deep, 10m wide and 109m long.
I had expected the Vecht to be a battered old vessel covered in grime and
black dust. Jan Veldman would be cheery enough, I thought, a ham-fisted,
hard-living bargee, a rough-polished truck driver of the waterways. Neither
assumption was anywhere near the truth.
With the general proportions of a pencil, the Vecht could not be called
graceful. But she was as well-kept and efficiently run as a Cunard liner.
She was almost as clean as a Cunard liner. My shoes came off at the door to
the wheelhouse. Like everyone on board I used a pair of rubber clogs
outdoors and exchanged them for bedroom slippers in the spotless interior.
On modest river trips of my own through the English countryside I find that
even the simplest operation requires many hands to cope with bow lines,
stern lines, lock gates, boat hooks and tiller. How many crew were needed
for this leviathan, I wondered. Eight? Ten? But no, here on the world's
busiest inland waterway, everything from 200m locks to blind navigation in
thick fog was handled by just three people.
The difference is that I am a clumsy amateur and these were life-long
professionals. None of them, however, remotely resembled my vision of the
picaresque bargee. Sender Bosch, the Vecht's deckhand, looked like a
17-year-old student, which is what he is - anytime he is not hosing down
decks, sandpapering or painting, he is studying for the series of tough
exams that will eventually allow him to become a Rhine barge captain.
His skipper, Jan Veldman, was indeed cheerful, but entirely failed in the
tough-guy category. Behind gold-rimmed glasses his face was mobile and
expressive. His hands were well-manicured, his trousers neatly pressed. He
looked like an academic on holiday.
The third member of the crew looked even less swash-buckling. Wearing a dark
skirt and flowered blouse, her bespectacled eyes focused on her sewing, Mrs
Veldman cut a comfortingly maternal figure. She should: she is the mother of
six children. Like most barges on the Rhine, where 16-hour days discourage
overtime wages and the growth of company fleets, the Vecht is a mom-and-pop
family operation.
Seen from mid-stream of the Rhine, Germany is a much prettier country than
from the autobahn or the railway. As we slowly beat our way upriver past Bad
Godesburg and Koningswinter, Remagen and Linz, there were all the signs of a
traditional rural past - fields and cows, stretches of forest, old towns
with half-timbered buildings and tall church spires.
But there was no getting away from the fact that we were in the heart of the
European powerhouse, a highly industrialised country in the middle of a
crowded continent. If the slumbering castles and vineyards of the Rhine
strike a note of Gothic romantic tradition, the storage tanks and cooling
towers, industrial parks, container terminals, electricity pylons and atomic
energy plants that lie along the Rhine's banks indicate a more vibrant,
contemporary industrial tradition.
I did not have to look as far as the shore to see that the Rhine is a highly
developed axis. The river itself throbs with the sound of waterborne goods
on the move. Over the next two days there was rarely a moment when the Vecht
was alone on the river. There were times when I could sweep its surface with
binoculars and see some of the river's more leisurely activities - a
week-ending sailboat, for example, a cabin cruiser, a kayak, or one of the
brightly-painted tour-boats of the Koln-Dusseldorfer line.
More usually, the narrow lanes between the river's bobbing red and green
channel markers were packed with the work-horses of the river getting on
with their daily business. There are more than 5,000 vessels registered for
use on the Rhine. Over a rainy grey afternoon I watched the progress of
scores of vessels - boats like the Korsika, a German barge carrying a load
of scrap metal; the Barco, from Zwijndrecht in the Netherlands, with three
decks jammed with Ford and Nissan cars; the Furka, a container-carrier from
Basel, in Switzerland; the Zenn, a fuel tanker from Wurzburg so heavily
laden that water was lapping her gunnels. And, like the Vecht herself,
heading south from the Victoria Augusta mine of the Ruhr valley to the
power-generating plant of the vast BASF chemical works near Mannheim, there
were innumerable coal barges.
For Jan Veldman, this is the only life he knows or cares for. He comes from
a line of Dutch bargemen who have worked the rivers and canals of the
Netherlands and Germany uninterruptedly for 400 years. In the 17th century
his ancestors were transporting peat by horse-drawn barge from the lowlands
of the eastern Netherlands to heat homes in Leyden, Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
By the 19th century they had changed to steam and moved on to the Rhine,
carrying coal and iron ore, bricks and raw materials for the supply of the
Ruhr's industrial revolution.
Jan was born on his father's barge, began riverwork as a deckhand at 14,
married a barge-skipper's daughter and took over his father's boat at 23.
Since 1962 he has made 30 to 40 long-haul trips on the Rhine every year. He
can identify hundreds of river boats by sight and knows the Rhine with his
eyes closed. Now 45, he hopes that his own son, Johannes, will take over
when he retires.
Jan is not a carefree river gipsy, but a man of strong Calvinist principle
who believes in family, hard work and individual initiative. What is it, I
asked as we sat in a wheelhouse full of complex engine, steering,
communication and radar equipment, that keeps him incessantly moving up and
down the Rhine? Like most men whose survival depends solely on their own
efforts, it is the life of independence that he values.
'I am the director of a company', he told me. 'It is only a little company,
this boat, but I am its director. I make my own choices and work in my own
way. I like the variety of my job. I would no more want to sit behind a
ship's wheel all day than I would want to sit behind an office desk all day.
I am a mechanic, a navigator, a maintenance man, a businessman.' He looked
out at the passing scene and smiled. 'My life and my job are one thing, but
never the same. This is a kind of freedom. From one minute to the next, life
on the river is constant change.'
And so it is. By late evening, the radar screen glowing green in the
darkness of the Vecht's wheelhouse, we had passed the lights of the town of
Boppard and moored out of the main shipping channel for the night.
Under the aft-deck the Veldmans retired to a sitting room full of books and
music and plants in quarters as comfortable as those of any suburban flat.
With the Veldman children far away in boarding schools in the Netherlands, I
settled down for the night in a snug bedroom wall-papered in clouds of pink
and white. Surrounded by puppets and wide-eyed dolls and the sound of the
current ceaselessly swirling around the stern, I drifted through a night of
restless dreams.
IT DID not last long. By 5am the floor beneath my bunk shuddered, the engine
below roared into life and we were moving between the high hills of the
Rhine gorge. This is the narrowest part of the river on its 1,000km length
between Lake Constance and Rotterdam on the North Sea, and also the fastest.
Up on deck, passing St Goar with the great defensive walls and turrets of
Rheinfels castle above us, I saw that the river's width had shrunk from its
customary 100m to something less than 50m. The surface of the water was
covered with rags of drifting mist, but they were not thick enough to hide
signs of a current now surging downstream at more than 10kph. That may not
sound fast. But in a narrow channel where 100m boats are negotiating winding
bends, where eddys, whirlpools and broken white water cover submerged rocks
and sandbanks, it is very fast indeed.
It is fast enough that the Lorelei, the high slate cliff that plunges into
the Rhine in the mid-section of the gorge, has become celebrated in Germanic
myth and song as a destroyer of ships and men. Certainly, watching Jan
Veldman concentrating at the helm of the Vecht as she churned upstream
through white water, it was fast enough for me to realise that the Rhine, no
matter how domesticated and business-like it has become, remains an exciting
river, one of the great waterways of the world.
That afternoon, some 180km from my starting point at Bonn and two hours past
the confluence of the Rhine and the Main, I bade my farewells and jumped
ship. It was time to head back down the river and home. In Rudesheim - a
renowned producer of Rhine wine and one of the kitschiest tourist traps in
Germany - I boarded the MV Koblenz.
As if on cue the clouds cleared, the sun appeared and the river turned from
leaden grey to sparkling blue. From the crowded glassed-in dining room of
the tour-boat, the Rhine had become another river. The work-a-day world of
the river disappeared and was replaced by the Rhine of dramatic sightseeing
and syrupy gemutlichkeit.
On steep crags and hills above the vineyards, famous castles and fortresses
slid by - Ehrenfels, Rheinstein, Marksburg, Reichenstein, Sooneck, Burg
Maus. On the ship's Tannoy there was a commentary in three languages. At the
tables there were sausages and schnitzel galore. Steins of beer were emptied
almost as quickly as they could be filled. At the Lorelei we all joined in
singing Heinrich Heine's stirring ode to the river.
There were tears in people's eyes, sentimental pride in their faces. They
were romantic, jolly, and emotional in a way only Teutons can be. I was
emotional, too. I was thinking of Jan Veldman sitting quietly with the rain
beating on the wheelhouse of the Vecht, and missing it.

FT  14 AUG 93 / The Long View: The tipster's torment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   YOU NAME it, he has a view on it

especially on airline food, but also occasionally on financial markets.
Which is why I was puzzled to find my old friend Steve the strategist in an
unusually reflective mood when he passed through London this week.
He had a new challenge: he had been invited to take part in one of the
round-table investment sessions featured by Barron's, the American financial
weekly. 'Congratulations', I said. 'This is your chance to become one of the
stars of the US financial media. Peter Lynch and Jim Rogers will eat their
hearts out.'
Steve frowned. 'This is no ego trip', he said. 'My presentation must be
carefully positioned. My regular professional clients are not going to pay a
small fortune in soft dollars for my opinions if they think they can read it
all for Dollars 2.50, even if that is hard cash. As for my firm, the idea is
to boost the sales of our mutual funds arm, not to give away our
institutional advice. That hems me in pretty tight.'
I observed that investment tipsters are much thinner on the ground in the
British media than in the US. That might partly reflect the meagre interest
in financial matters in the UK, but perhaps also a native cynicism about
motivation. After all, Jim Slater in the Independent had been sniped at from
all around.
'Sure, from my viewpoint the whole theoretical basis of stock market
opinions is complex', said Steve, in his usual model-building manner. 'On
the conscious plane, practitioners are going to hold something back, and may
even deliberately mislead. Subconsciously, too, they may be under pressure
to talk their book, even when they don't realise it, which is why investor
opinion surveys have to be treated so carefully.
'Ask yourself, why would a professional money manager recite a list of his
favourite stocks into a newspaper's tape recorder? The politest thing you
can say is that his first loyalty must be to his clients. Therefore you can
bet that all his buying programmes have been completed, certainly in the
illiquid stocks.
'He would be crazy to spoil the market in his real hot stocks, the ones he
is actually buying. So basically he is trying to massage up the prices of
his major holdings. It's a small step from there to say that he might be
attempting to create some counter-party demand into which he can offload.'
Hence, I remarked, the old stock market saying that 'A tip is a tap.' At
least, he was under rather less pressure in that his main focus was on
markets rather than individual stocks.
'Sure, a mention in a press article isn't going to shift the Tokyo market',
said Steve, 'but people normally want an individual recommendation or two to
focus on. Besides, these days we seem to be promoting emerging markets where
there are typically only three or four stocks of any size, one brewery, the
president's family construction company and two banks busy laundering the
cocaine money.'
But allocations to emerging markets were small, I said. Meanwhile there were
some quite strong views among professional investors about major markets -
for example, that Wall Street was expensive.
'Certainly there are some strong views emerging from the surveys right now',
said Steve. 'I make a special study of these. I was just this morning
looking at a local poll in our London office, Godwins' Cityscope, which
collates the opinions of leading UK money management houses. It has been
highly bullish all year about equities but weak to neutral about gilts. Yet
gilts have outperformed. So why have the experts all been wrong?
'The point is', he continued, 'such opinion polls must be viewed in a
dynamic rather than a static way. Look at it like this: most UK pension
funds have 60 per cent of their portfolios in UK equities. The managers have
to believe the UK equity market is going up, otherwise they logically would
be big sellers. At the same time, the exposure to US equities is only 5 per
cent, half the neutral weighting. They give Wall Street the thumbs down. But
although such surveys claim to tell us about the future, they really only
tell us about the past.
'In fact, the more optimistic the opinion the more dangerous the market
risks may have become. When the last bear has turned bullish the market is
at its peak. That's how it works with US mutual fund inflows, one of the
most famous cyclical indicators. Record inflows tell you that the market is
near a high.
'At the other end of the cycle, a mutual fund selling panic tells you that
there will soon be real value around. It's when strong opinions change that
the real action can happen. Recently, of course, US mutual funds have been
selling in unbelievable volume.'
So what is Steve going to tell US retail investors?
'Markets are high', he said. 'This is not the time to be chasing value to
the ends of the earth and winding up in the Colombian stock market. Funnily
enough, although it's not really my scene as a strategist, it's a time for
stockpickers. Overall market levels may be moving sideways or marginally
higher, but just look at the individual stock price movements. Investors put
a huge premium on recovery and growth, then withdraw when the earnings
numbers disappoint. There are some great trading opportunities, and if I
were running portfolios, imagine the advantage of being able to create my
own exits.'
So would he really be setting out his favourite stocks? Steve shifted
awkwardly in his seat.
'Let's say that I have my own agenda. Look at it this way, my firm pays me a
lot of money, but readers of newspapers expect something for nothing.
Loyalty comes first. If I mention a few stocks, don't be at all surprised if
entirely coincidentally there turn out to be some equity underwritings in
the next few weeks.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Health cuts cost jobs and trade, say drugs companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS to cut National Health Service spending on drugs have
cost thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of pounds of exports,
according to pharmaceuticals groups operating in the UK.
The measures - including the surprise extension of the blacklists of
products no longer available on prescription and a 2.5 per cent price cut -
have undermined drugs companies' confidence in the stability of the British
market, they say.
Manufacturing investment has been particularly affected, they claim. Imports
of drugs into the UK are already increasing more rapidly than exports,
although there is still a trade surplus of Pounds 1.3bn.
Mr Mike Wilson, the managing director of Cyanamid UK, a subsidiary of
American Cyanamid, said: 'The extension of the selected lists (blacklists)
is disastrous. It is hitting some companies extremely hard, affecting
investment, jobs and exports, while generating little financial gain for the
Treasury.'
The government's measures are aimed at keeping under control NHS drugs
expenditure which was Pounds 3.4bn last year and increased 14 per cent.
Groups that have deferred or decided against investment in Britain after the
announcement of government measures include:
Parke Davis, a subsidiary of the US group Warner Lambert, which announced
this year it planned to move most production from Pontypool, south Wales, to
the US or continental Europe within three years. Staff at Pontypool will be
cut from 1,000 five years ago to 300.
Lundbeck of Denmark, which bought a 20-acre site at Seal Sands near
Middlesbrough at the beginning of the year, has now frozen development. The
board is now looking at building at another location outside the UK, after
the introduction of the limited lists. All production from Seal Sands would
have been exported.
E. Merck, the German group which, according to the independent industry
newsletter Scrip, might have made an investment of more than Pounds 100m,
generating 200 jobs at Pontypool, has been lost to the continent because of
the limited list.
Syntex of the US, which is closing its finished product plant at Iver,
Buckinghamshire. Most production is being diverted to Spain.
Cyanamid which has frozen development of a 28-acre site acquired last year
at Gosport in Hampshire. The company was forced this week to halve the price
of Traxam, an anti-inflammatory product with UK sales last year of Pounds
10m, to avoid it being blacklisted.

FT  14 AUG 93 / FBI asks GM for all files in VW spying row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Justice Department has stepped up its investigation of the industrial
espionage conflict between General Motors and Volkswagen with a demand to
see all GM documents relating to the case, officials representing the US
group said yesterday.
Federal Bureau of Investigation officers have sent a three-page list of
requests for documents, including all GM affidavits, files and telephone
records.
The move will come as a further blow to VW, which has been under the shadow
of possible legal action against its production director, Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, since German investigators started a similar formal
probe in May.
That investigation appears to be moving rapidly forward. Public prosecutors
in Darmstadt interrogated Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a former VW board director,
on Thursday. Although removed from the board early last month, he was likely
to have been well informed on Mr Lopez's abrupt switch from GM in mid-March.
His interrogation suggests that Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and other
executives, may be called shortly.
Mr Lopez and three colleagues also under suspicion of espionage, theft and
fraud are most likely to be questioned last, lawyers say.
The US move suggests the FBI, which started examining the case in July, is
launching a full-scale inquiry. Employees of VW and GM could be called for
questioning in Washington.
The basis of the Justice Department probe is not known, but there have been
reports from the US that it wants to examine the VW/Opel issue as a possible
test case in a clampdown on international industrial espionage.
Lawyers familiar with US intellectual property law say the FBI's demands,
and evidence and allegations to emerge from a similar German investigation,
suggest suspected wire or mail fraud as the most likely line of inquiry.
A catch-all section of the US criminal code forbids the use of postal and
telecommunications networks - inside and outside the US - for illegal
purposes including 'violations of obligations of loyal and fruitful service'
to an employer.
Penalties include imprisonment and heavy fines, generally calculated as
multiples of the estimated damage to the aggrieved party or benefit to the
perpetrators. The fines can apply to companies as well as individuals.
VW yesterday called in a firm of accountants, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, to
carry out an independent investigation of allegations that its recruits from
GM may have brought secret documents from their former employer.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Israel accepts direct talks with PLO on Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL will for the first time hold face-to-face talks with negotiators
openly representing the Palestine Liberation Organisation when the next
round of the Middle East peace process opens in Washington, probably at the
end of this month.
The Israeli government's resistance to direct talks with the PLO finally
crumbled yesterday. Members of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's cabinet confirmed that
Israel would continue the negotiations despite the decision by PLO leaders
in Tunis to appoint seven members of the Palestinian peace talks delegation
to an official PLO leadership committee.
All parties to the talks have been invited by the US and Russia, the joint
sponsors, to resume talks on August 30, but the Arab response will not be
known until later this month.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, claimed yesterday that the
appointments of key Palestinian negotiators - including Mr Faisal Husseini,
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Haider Abdel Shafi - to the PLO committee was of
little significance. 'For us, it doesn't matter,' he said. 'It's the same
members of the delegation, the same names, the same people, the same
procedure.'
But Israel's decision not to protest about the appointments and to resume
talks with Palestinians now formally part of the PLO leadership constitutes
a marked change in policy.
The previous Israeli government, led by the hardline Likud party, agreed to
talk directly only to Palestinians who had no formal PLO role.
'We tried to build a wall between Palestinian residents of the territories
and PLO Tunis (where the organisation is based),' Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the
former prime minister, recalled yesterday. 'This government has destroyed
the wall.'
Earlier this week, when Mr Husseini, Mrs Ashrawi and a third Palestinian
negotiator, Mr Saeb Erakat, threatened to resign from the peace delegation
in protest at their limited influence over policy positions, Mr Rabin warned
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, not to consider replacing them with PLO
figures.
By keeping the delegation intact but giving its members official PLO status,
Mr Arafat appears to have outmanoeuvred Mr Rabin, who would clearly rather
swallow the change and play down its importance than risk torpedoeing the
direct talks.
Most Israelis probably share Mr Shamir's belief, expressed yesterday, that
the PLO remains 'a terrorist organisation' bent on Israel's destruction.
But they have also witnessed the rise of the radical Hamas Islamic
fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories. Many have realised,
along with Mr Rabin, that it might be better to sit down now with PLO
leaders pressing for a state alongside Israel than risk the PLO's
replacement by Hamas leaders openly pledged to wiping Israel off the map.

FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The depression in UK food retailing shares this year has been matched only
by that of the drug companies. There are short term explanations for this -
food retailers are defensive companies in a market obsessed by potential
recovery shares. Low inflation hurts food retailers because they are much
more dependent than other stores on rising prices for growth. Yet the fall
is too great to be fully explained by such factors. Food shares now stand at
a 25 year low compared with stores, a level which was only approached during
the price battles of the late 1970s.
What the chart really shows is that investors are anticipating a disaster in
food retailing. There is a fear that a combination of competition from
discount chains and consumer resistance to high margins may spark a price
war between the superstore operators, which would cut their selling margins
and undermine the value of their extremely expensive sites.
Unfortunately, superstores cannot compete fully against the discounters on
price because cutting prices that far would eliminate profits. Their
strategic options are thus limited, and they are trying to preserve their
margins with other marketing tricks. But a price war cannot be ruled out if
superstore sales volumes start to sag and cash flows weaken. The current
sector valuation is a balance between the probability of a mild rerating if
these fears evaporate and the outside possibility of a collapse in margins,
profits and asset values. That outside chance may be enough to keep buyers
at bay, unless the news improves.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Surging UK equity and bond markets and hints of lower interest rates have
created another ripple of excitement in property. With yields on most assets
now falling sharply, the 9 per cent yield apparently still on offer is
attractive. Investors able to buy prime properties with long leases, secure
tenants and upwards-only rent reviews may earn higher returns than from
almost any other asset class over the next few years.
Theoretically, property shares should be highly geared to a recovery in
capital values. This helps explain the sector's continued popularity despite
its mere 4 per cent yield. There is a danger, though, that property shares
are running way ahead of themselves. The recent rash of rights issues has
only reduced gearing. Moreover, it will be difficult for companies to buy
attractive properties since sellers are scarce in a rising market.
Property companies may be tempted to buy secondary locations. But such sites
are by definition risky. Any large interest rate rises would expose them
horribly. Capital values are unlikely to be underpinned by private buyers
because of the banks' reluctance to lend. The hope must be that rising rents
will push up capital values. But that prospect remains hazy, considering the
vast glut of secondary property still on the market. The latest data
suggests rental values are still continuing to fall.

FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's shareholders glancing quickly at yesterday's results must be
wondering what the brands rumpus is all about. They have seen their shares
slump by 17 per cent since Marlboro Friday. Yet in unhelpful markets,
Unilever showed good sales volume gains in its first half and an encouraging
0.1 percentage point advance in operating margins to 8.8 per cent. While it
is flattered by currency gains, a 21 per cent increase in sterling earnings
hardly suggests a consumer goods business in secular decline.
A closer inspection, though, reveals a slippage of both US and European
operating margins. The difficult question is whether this is temporary or
presages a more ominous trend. The current squeeze may result from one-off
pressures as recession grips mainland Europe and Procter &amp; Gamble makes a
splash in detergents in the US. Investors seem likely to suspend judgment
until the smoke clears from the battlefield.
Unilever may be able to rehabilitate itself with the market if it
demonstrates more aggressive growth in emerging economies, where sales and
margins continue to rise strongly. The company currently derives about 20
per cent of sales from what it calls the rest of the world. With interest
cover of 14 times, Unilever is certainly in a fine position to exploit
further opportunities. If investors do come round to the view that consumer
goods companies have been oversold, those manufacturers with big exposures
to developing markets should be among the first to gain. Along with Nestle
and CPC International, Unilever would then find particular favour.

FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rights curtailed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In contrast to the late 1980s, there are not many company chairmen grumbling
that their shares are undervalued. In a week when the FT-SE 100 index broke
the 3,000 barrier, industrialists were distinctly downbeat. Companies which
have reported recently have not shown much sign of economic upturn, and
there are clearly risks that the September interim reporting season will be
disappointing.
There is also the possibility that companies will view the recent market
rally as an opportunity to raise cheap equity through rights issues. Some
Pounds 7bn was raised in the first half of the year, putting 1993 on course
to top the record Pounds 10.7bn raised in 1991. Admittedly, the current
quarter has been quiet, but that can be explained both by the summer lull
and the backwash from the large BT3 and Zeneca issues.
Yet the number of companies which may seize the opportunity is dwindling.
Balance sheets have strengthened markedly since 1989 - average gearing has
fallen from 36 per cent then to 22 per cent now. Of those which want funds,
it seems that the only companies who have not had a rights issue are those
who have had two. Banks passed up the opportunity this time, some insurers
and property companies came in the first half and many of the consumer
companies swinging back into fashion have no great need for funds. Cyclical
engineers and some hotel and leisure companies remain the most likely
candidates. Even those issues which do come seem unlikely to trouble the
market. Interest rate cuts, rising gilts and a search for yield are driving
shares hard, though the nervous may suspect too hard.

FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Early bonds rally fails to
inspire Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS stayed close to opening values yesterday in spite of more good
inflation news and further gains in bond market prices, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56 at 3,569.65,
having moved in a tight trading range all day. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 1.18 at 450.14, while the Amex composite
finished 1.50 firmer at 439.08, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.10 at 718.22.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 215m shares.
After Thursday's profit-taking and program selling, which lopped 14 points
off the Dow, the mood of the markets was much more subdued, with sporadic
buying by bargain hunters the only notable feature.
For the second consecutive day, an early rally in bond prices failed to
inspire equity investors. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government
bond was up  1/4 at 98, and the yield had descended to a record low of 6.346
per cent.
As on the previous day, yesterday's jump in bonds was sparked by good
inflation news.
The Labor department reported that its index of consumer prices rose by just
0.1 per cent in July, a slightly smaller increase than expected. Taken
together with Thursday's reported decline in producer prices, analysts said
that it was clear the inflationary threat to the economy, which reared its
ugly head earlier this year, had fully abated.
Among individual sectors, Mexican stocks were in demand following the news
that trade negotiators from the US, Canada and Mexico had reached an
agreement on labour and environmental issues that had been holding up
approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Telefonos de Mexico rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 in volume of 3.8m
shares, Mexico Equity &amp; Income Fund climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 7/8
and Mexico Fund put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 26 5/8 .
T2 Medical, down another Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 7, continued its plunge in
the wake of news that the company will have to reduce its reported first and
second quarter earnings because of accounting irregularities.
Big computer stocks were in mixed form, with Compaq down Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 52 3/8 , but Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 75 3/8 . On
the Nasdaq market, Borland International fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16 1/4
after a US judge ruled that the company's revised version of its Quattro Pro
product continues to violate Lotus Development's copyrights on its 1-2-3
spreadsheets. Lotus firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 .
Casino Data climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 14 1/4 after the Nevada Gaming
Control Board approved the company's multi-site system to link slot machines
throughout the state.
Canada
TORONTO closed narrowly mixed in relatively quiet trading. The TSE-300
composite index closed up 5.65 points (0.14 per cent) at 4014.62, but
declining issues outnumbered advances 348 to 330. Volume was 47.4m shares,
compared with Thursday's 52.1m. On the week, the 300 composite index rose
about 55 points. Eight of 14 sub-indexes closed higher, led by consumer
products. Real estate was the biggest faller.

FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners discover the joys of going
Dutch - Overseas buying has helped Amsterdam to enjoy a record-setting
summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to all forecasts, the Amsterdam stock exchange is enjoying a
record-setting summer.
The appetite of foreign investors for European shares has touched off an
unexpected rally in Dutch cyclicals, catching domestic investors off their
guard and surprising professionals who had gone short on the assumption that
share prices would limp through July and August.
The climb in share prices has been translated into a series of 12-month
highs for companies involved in some of the most recession-hit areas of the
domestic and European economy, and the main bourse indices have reached a
series of all-time peaks.
The rally in cyclicals, which had not been expected until late 1993 at the
earliest, has stolen some of the limelight from 'defensive' bourse stalwarts
like Elsevier, the publisher, and Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and
consumer products group.
In recent days Hoogovens, the steel group, and DSM, the chemicals company,
have been 'rewarded' for their weak first-half figures and their gloomy
assessment of economic prospects with sharp increases in their share prices.
Hoogovens jumped by 10 per cent on Wednesday, after predicting that losses
would fall in the second half but also after saying that the economic
outlook of its main European customers remained bleak.
Spurred on by Hoogovens and other cyclicals, the CBS Tendency index rose to
a record 128.4 on Thursday, up nearly 35 per cent since the start of the
year, before easing to 127.9 yesterday. By contrast, at the end of May, when
Amsterdam investors usually sell and go away, the cumulative rise for the
year was only 10 per cent.
This surprising turn of events has caused a 'short squeeze' for investors
and stockbrokers who sold shares earlier with an eye to buying them back at
a lower price later.
One small brokerage, Nusse Brink, was suspended from trading at the end of
last week when it could no longer cover its short positions. This has also
affected Van den Broek, a company with a clearing role, which is owned by
James Capel's Amsterdam operation. Capel and the bourse's management are so
far at odds over whether Van den Broek is entitled to compensation from the
exchange's contingency funds.
Stocks shorted by investors include DSM, Fokker and Philips, all three of
which have reached 12-month highs, partly by a scramble to cover positions.
But analysts say the cyclical rally is being fuelled by more than
short-covering and that it could be sustained into the autumn. Philips, for
example, is benefiting from second-quarter figures which revealed that the
company's financial position and its debt ratios are improving, even
although operating profits continue to suffer from the malaise in consumer
electronics and communications.
This improvement, together with the planned acquisition of Motown by its
majority-owned PolyGram record company, has taken Philips's shares to around
Fl 37 compared with a low of Fl 16.90 last November.
Foreign buying has helped to turn other investors' attention to the
prospects for lower interest rates, to the widespread restructuring of Dutch
industry which will pay off when economic recovery comes and to the expected
strengthening of the dollar, traditionally a positive factor for the
outward-looking companies listed on the Amsterdam exchange.
Apart from the likelihood of profit-taking in some individual stocks,
analysts are not predicting a major correction in prices soon.
Mr Rob Sweers, an analyst at Banque Paribas in Amsterdam, says: 'Underlying
sentiment is strong, the market is becoming broader and volumes are on the
increase.' The bourse should remain well-supported by some investors
covering short positions and by others anxious not to miss the rally, he
adds.
His preference is for 'quality cyclicals' such as Akzo, Philips, Hunter
Douglas and Oce-van der Grinten, as well as financial stocks, rather than
the food and beverage sector or publishers which benefited most from the
higher prices earlier this year but whose share performance now is more
modest than the high-flying cyclicals. Companies in the throes of
restructuring could also be well-placed.
At Mees Pierson, the Amsterdam-based investment bank, Mr Frank Hoogendijk
attributes the summer rally to a willingness among foreign investors in
particular to take a long-term view rather than to dwell on the current
economic climate. 'Private investors have not been terribly active so far,'
he says, noting that their entry could extend the rally. He believes that
there is room for selective profit-taking in 'heavy cyclicals' but says that
a substantial correction across the board seems unlikely.
Steady performers such as Royal Dutch, financial issues and publishers make
up more than 60 per cent of Amsterdam's market capitalisation. 'The trend
for these companies will remain good as long as profits continue to rise and
interest rates are not raised,' he believes.

FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul suffers biggest
ever one-day fall
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sharp rise in the yen to a record high against the dollar triggered
profit-taking, erasing earlier gains, and the Nikkei index posted its first
fall in five trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Japanese shares fell further in London later, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
falling 9.65 to 1,272.18 on evidence of rising real estate debts and news of
fresh probes into dubious securities deals, both emerging after the Tokyo
close.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei ended 20.11 down at 20,745.17, 2.5 per cent higher on
the week, after fluctuating between 20,686.77 and 20,921.89. Trading was
hardly affected by the settlement of August futures option contracts.
Volume totaled 480m shares against 505m. Dealers sought large-capital
issues, while foreign and institutional investors took profits. Advances led
declines by 497 to 483 with 178 unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 3.10 to 1,683.08 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
lost 9.65 to 1,272.18.
A fall in the bond market was a further cause for pessimism among stock
market participants. The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark rose 0.085
percentage points to 4.08 per cent.
Utilities turned lower on increased calls for price cuts on the back of the
higher yen. Ms Manae Kubota, head of the economic planning agency, said that
the benefits of a higher yen were not filtering through to consumers as
energy suppliers were maintaining electricity and gas prices. Tokyo Electric
Power fell Y60 to Y3,760.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 17.21 to 22,745.01 in volume of 33.9m shares.
Rohm, a semiconductor maker, fell Y60 to Y1,970 on profit taking.
Roundup
THE region produced some distinct contrasts, investors reacting badly to a
key reform in South Korea, but appreciating bank results in Singapore and
improved prospects in India.
SEOUL saw its greatest one-day tumble since it was founded in 1977 on the
government's ban on trading under false or borrowed names. The composite
index ended 32.37, or 4.5 per cent lower at 693.57, 3.9 per cent down on the
week.
A total of 917 shares went limit down, and brokers said the general fall was
stemmed by the system of daily permitted lows; they said that the reform
could depress the market for some time but that, in the long run, it was
very good news for the market.
However, trading was thin, only Won23.34bn against Thursday's 221.68bn after
the finance minister ordered the market to be closed yesterday morning, and
institutions kept largely to the sidelines.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index ended at a record closing high of
1,917.87, up 15.07 on the day and 1.8 per cent up a week which featured some
good bank interims.
BOMBAY rose 38.68 to a five-month high of 2,522.48, 6.2 per cent up on the
week, on the removal of political uncertainties, improved prospects for the
economy and heavy foreign buying.
HONG KONG rose on a climb in index futures and in Hutchison, which sold a
News Corp ADRs holding. The Hang Seng index closed 52.70 higher at 7,392.25,
little changed on the week. Turnover dipped from HK4.85bn to HKDollars
4.50bn.
AUSTRALIA's gold index dropped 123.9, or 5.7 per cent, to 2,040.6 as bullion
eased offshore, and the All Ordinaries ended 17.4 lower at 1,855.9, 0.7 per
cent down on the week.
NEW ZEALAND showed a 1.9 per cent fall on the week as the NZSE-40 index
closed 28.23 lower at 1,860.28.

US BUYING was reported again in Germany, France, Spain and Portgual, taking
some bourses higher and trimming earlier losses elsewhere, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated Thursday's gains, the DAX index closing another 1.63
higher at 1,906.58 for a rise of 2 per cent on the week. Turnover fell from
DM12.2bn to DM9.4bn.
Volkswagen supported the foreign buying thesis, in spite of continued
speculation about the job security of some of its top management. The shares
incorporated Thursday's post gains, and more, to close DM15 higher at
DM399.50. Elsewhere, Lufthansa was still inspired by its second quarter turn
from loss into profits, the shares rising another DM10.30 to DM148.30, up
11.9 per cent on the week.
In engineering, KHD rose DM6.30 to DM123.30 with Swiss-based buying
reported. In chemicals, Schering saw profit-taking after gains on its new MS
drug, and fell DM22 to DM942.
PARIS ended virtually flat on the week with the CAC-40 index 13.87 down on
the day, but well off its worst at 2,148.00. The government's apparently
unswerving devotion to austere economic policies dented expectations of
short-term official rate cuts.
Turnover was healthy, but lower at FFr3.58bn. The mood was not improved by
first-half corporate revenue figures. Michelin, where first half sales fell
12 per cent, and where there were profits to be taken, fell FFr3.30 to
FFr192.20; Rhone-Poulenc, with first half turnover down 5.9 per cent, slid
FFr3.80 to FFr158.
MILAN was enlivened by exceptionally heavy trading in Ferruzzi in otherwise
quiet conditions as the market wound down to the end of the monthly account
on Monday. The Comit index eased 1.99 to 588.97, for a 1.3 per cent advance
on the week.
Ferruzzi added L55.4 or 20.31 per cent to L328.2 in volume of almost 59m
shares. Mr Matteo Amoretti of Albertini in Milan said many investors had
been confused about the share's correct price level when it resumed trading
on Thursday after a two day suspension.
'They decided yesterday it had become a penny share, similar to an option or
warrant with no maturity. There is very little downside risk but there is
upside potential in the event of a recovery,' he said.
ZURICH returned to its record-setting ways, although some profit-taking
emerged in banks after their strong showing on Thursday. The SMI index rose
10.5 to 2,461.0, 1.6 per cent higher on the week.
Nestle, the most actively traded share, rose SFr25 to SFr1,080, taking its
advance over the week to 6 per cent, after recent weakness.
MADRID rose on lower-than-expected July inflation data and expectations of
diminishing interest rates. The general index climbed another 2.74 to
281.22, up 4.1 per cent on the week, and turnover stayed high at Pta25.6bn,
fractionally higher than Thursday's figure.
ATHENS surged 2.6 per cent to a year's high as the Greek parliament approved
the long-awaited bill for the privatisation of OTE, the state
telecommunications company. The general index rose 23.87 for a weekly rise
of 3 per cent.
LISBON continued its climb, the BTA index rising another 41.7 to 2,390.1. Mr
John Ferreira of Carnegie International gave the credit to US buying on
Portgual's low and falling interest rates, and economic recovery hopes after
the escudo devaluation.
STOCKHOLM advanced to a year's high in heavy trading, and the Affarsvarlden
index rose 6.2 to 1293.3, 3.4 per cent higher on the week. S-E Banken A
shares rose SKr9.5 or 15.8 per cent to SKr69.5 after a press report about
plans for a new share issue.
OSLO was up 1.7 per cent in record turnover of NKr1.4bn. The all-share index
rose 9.69 to 590.28, up 8 per cent on the week.

FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food and toiletries giant Unilever produced figures at the top end of
expectations and the shares appreciated 10 to 986p. However, hopes that the
figures might herald a turnaround in the group's and food manufacturing
sector's fortunes were largely disappointed as Unilever reported continuing
tough trading conditions in the North American detergent market and little
upturn throughout its European operations. Most gains were made in emerging
markets.
Unilever shares have been badly hit by worries over the fate of its brands
as some of the world's top branded goods producers have been forced to cut
prices this year in response to cheaper alternatives. Low food price
inflation has also dragged the stock and the sector lower.
One analyst said he remained cautious over any recovery in the sector's
share prices, though he admitted that Unilever's low rating - the stock has
underperformed the market by 23 per cent in the past 12 months - made it
look attractive as a longer-term recovery play.
Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst at Strauss Turnbull, went further.
'This is a good set of results which should go some way to restoring the
market's confidence in the underlying strengths of Unilever,' he said. 'In a
nutshell: brands bite back.'
There was further evidence of a change in sentiment in food retailing stocks
as another two stockbroking firms turned positive on the sector. Dealers
said that Henderson Crosthwaite had issued a buy note on three of the
sector's leading stocks, arguing that the ratings had fallen too far.
UBS was also said to be preparing to launch a 'buy' note early next week in
which the broker will argue that the sector looks oversold and that the
potential for any further downside is severely limited. Yesterday, Argyll
showed some signs of recovery, adding 2 to 327p. Albert Fisher gained 4 to
73p, Kwik Save 4 to 682p and J Sainsbury 3 1/2 to 484 1/2 p.
Food manufacturing stocks, chased up this week on yield considerations, ran
into a bout of profit-taking. Booker, off 3, recovered to close unchanged at
443p. Dalgety lost 6 to 489p and Hillsdown a penny to 161p. Elsewhere,
Unilever's performance was matched only by United Biscuits, up 4 at 379p.
Unigate retreated 8 to 391p and Tate and Lyle 5 to 393p.
Tour operator Airtours gained 3 to 378p after Canadian-owned rival Thomson
reported good summer results and healthy pre-booking for next summer.
Leisure analysts expect a crucial week ahead as the rival camps unveil their
brochures and prices which should indicate the potential for discounting.
Standard Chartered continued its impressive rally after Thurday's results.
The shares closed 18 up at 967p. Profit-takers were at work on Barclays
which has enjoyed a firm run after its recent figures. The shares slipped 7
to 494p.
The share price of Medeva tumbled 11 1/2 to 95 1/2 p in late trading on news
that a lawsuit had started in the US against the management regarding
statements on the company's business prospects. Analysts said such actions
were not uncommon in the US after large falls in shares.
Wellcome shed 14 to 641p on US health cut worries. Smith &amp; Nephew,
manufacturer of medical and consumer healthcare products, lost 1 to 143 1/2
in record daily turnover of 18m shares after negative comments from analysts
on its interim figures. NatWest Securities said the combination of modest
earnings growth coupled with high risk continued to warrant a reduction in
overweight holdings.
Credit Lyonnais Laing issued a note saying that British Land continued to
offer the highest dividend growth prospects, pushing its share price up 4 to
370p, before settling down to the opening 366p. Land Security, which
appreciated 14 to 674p, and Brixton Estate, which fell 3 to 237p, were the
only other property leaders the securities house expected to increase
dividends.

FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Yields boost for waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER stocks surged as investors decided that their recent underperformance
had been overdone and the yield qualities looked attractive. At the same
time, the sector ignored the clouds cast over some other utilities by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into British Gas due on Tuesday.
UBS was said to be prominent, according to dealers, in pointing out the
relative cheapness of the water stocks. The sector has lagged behind on
regulatory concerns, as the rest of the market has rushed ahead. From the
beginning of July to mid-August, waters underperformed the market by 3 per
cent, according to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell at NatWest Securities. 'Having
fallen behind, they're doing some catching up, but we are still feeling
cautious ahead of Tuesday,' he said.
Utility analysts are concerned that the MMC's decision on what the rate of
returns allowable by Gas should be will be followed by the water and
electricity regulators. In the case of the water stocks, analysts said there
was some correlation between the Gas pipeline return to be decided on
Tuesday and the water companies infrastructure. 'Anything below 4.5 per cent
will be bad for waters,' said one specialist.
All the stocks showed hefty gains. Among these, Anglian jumped 15 to 510p,
Thames 13 to 520p and Yorkshire 14 to 530p.
British Gas edged 4 ahead to 332 1/2 p. A rally by the Recs saw most stay in
positive territory by the end of the session.

FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with new all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD NEWS from the gilt-edged market gave a final boost to equities
yesterday, enabling the FT-SE Index to end the trading account at a new peak
and solidly above the 3,000 level, which had been twice lost earlier in the
session. Government bonds, also easier at first, turned sharply higher in
late trading after the Bank of England said it would not hold the
conventional auction of bonds this month.
Equity chart analysts found particular satisfaction in the Footsie's success
in closing above 3,000 again, despite the expected end-of-account profit
taking. At last night's final reading of 3,010.1, the Footsie showed a gain
of 1 point on the day and 40.3 on the week. Pre-occupied with its own
affairs, London paid little heed to the gain of 3 points on the Dow
Industrial Average in early New York trading.
Over the account, the Footsie Index has put on 83.6 points, or 2.9 per cent,
as confidence that UK base rates will be cut soon has been stimulated by
reductions in interest rates by the French authorities.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a range of second line stocks, rallied
from early falls yesterday to gain 3.7 to 3,455.5, maintaining its unbroken
run of daily gains which now stretches back to July 21.
At the long end of the gilt-edged market, prices recouped early losses of
3/8 or so and were already firmer when the Bank of England announcement
brought final gains of nearly a full point.
Short dates shaded easier on the belief that rate cuts may have to wait
until the autumn, while index-linked gilts indicated underlying concerns
over inflation by gaining about  1/2 point. Seaq volume in equities remained
high at 753.8m shares. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up about 63 per
cent of the day's total, indicating once again the presence of the private
investor in the equity market this week.
On Thursday, Seaq volume of 908.2m shares represented Pounds 2.18bn in
retail worth, the highest daily figure this year.
High equity turnover implies high profits for the London-based securities
houses, and has been reflected in the strength of merchant banking issues
which have substantially outperformed the rest of the market over the past
12 months.
Good trading news from Unilever cheered the stock market yesterday, although
there was some concern over progress in the US.

DERIVATIVES markets had a much quieter session in London yesterday, and
tended to follow the fortunes of the UK government bond future contract,
writes Terry Byland.
The September contract on the Footsie, which has played a significant role
this week in the equity market's move above the 3,000 mark on the FT-SE
Index, moved nervously at first as profits were taken in the underlying
market. At worst, the contract dipped to 2,996.
However, renewed demand as the underlying stock market moved into the new
trading account was given a further and significant boost by the Bank of
England's decision not to hold the usual gilt-edged auction this month.
With both the gilt future and bond prices rising sharply in late trading,
the Footsie September future jumped to a close of 3,024, a premium of 17
against the cash market; fair value premium is now below 3 points.
Volume in traded options fell by about one-third to 20,783 contracts, with
the FT-SE contract down to 4,931.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French rates up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH franc interest rate futures fell back sharply yesterday amid new sign
that the Bank of France intends to keep its short term money market rates
high, writes James Blitz.
On Thursday night, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister,
reaffirmed the French government's policy of keeping France's short term
interest rates at their current levels to support the franc's value against
the D-Mark.
Asked if he would cut interest rates, Mr Balladur said: 'They have started
to come down, but what counts first and above all is to fight inflation,
fight the budget deficit, ensure growth ..Lower interest rates will come to
us as a bonus.'
That view led to a sharp rise in French cash market rates yesterday, while
the futures fell back in the belief that 3-month interest rates will still
be around the 7 per cent level in a month's time.
The September French franc contract dropped 42 basis points to close at
93.46 while the December contract dropped 26 basis points to close at 94.42.
French 3-month money rose sharply as the franc came under pressure against
the D-Mark, closing at 8 per cent, having been at 7.80 per cent earlier in
the day. The overnight rate of lending was at about 9.75 per cent towards
the end of the day.
In Germany, by contrast, events were thinner on the ground. The September
shot sterling contract rose only 1 basis point on the day to close at 93.53.
German call money was slightly easier at between 6.65 and 6.80 per cent in
the wake of the Bundesbank's injection of liquidity earlier this week.
Sterling interest rate futures continued to reflect some bullishness about a
near term cut in UK rates, despite the pound's sharp fall against the D-Mark
on the foreign exchanges.
The September contract was up 1 basis point at 9.28, while the December
contract was unchanged at 94.73. One London dealer found it extraordinary
that the market was sticking to established levels for the September
contract while the pound was under pressure. 'he chances of a rate cut now,
with European rates high and the pound sinking is zero,' he said.
Three month money, by contrast, rose from 5.75 per cent to about 5.87 per
cent on the bid side yesterday. A Pounds 1.6bn daily shortage was easily
despatched.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc and krone fall again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc and Danish krone fell close to historic lows against the
D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers took the view
that their policy of keeping short term interest rates high would not work,
writes James Blitz.
France negative reserves position continued to work against the franc's
favour yesterday because dealers believe that the French authorities must
buy D-Marks to rebuild reserves and repay the Bundesbank for its support
defending the currency in the ERM.
Mr Edouard Balladur's strong hint on French tv on Thursday night that French
rates would remain high did not help the currency. Nor, too, did his
suggestion that France was seeking ways of controlling currency speculation:
one analyst suggested yesterday that this might be enough to encourage some
major players to hedge their bond exposures.
The franc therefore closed at FFr3.538 from a previous FFr. 3.514. Mr Jim
O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation, believes that the
franc is heading for FFr3.60 in the next few weeks. 'If France does not
reduce rates, it could go lower,' he said.
The rest of Europe was dominated by D-Mark strength. The Danish krone fell
sharply to a low of DKr4.1400 against the German currency, having been at
DKr4.1200 at the start of the day. Even the Dutch guilder came under attack
at one stage; dealers have at various stages this week wondered about the
credibility of the more closely tied currencies in Europe. At the close of
ERM trading yesterday, there were some 8.43 percentage points dividing the
strongest and weakest ERM currencies.
The yen was, again, the other source of interest touching a new high of
Y101.80 in Europe, before closing at Y102.20. The Bank of Japan intervened
again in the currency market. But the Japanese currency was boosted by
comments from Mr Walter Mondale, the new US ambassador to Tokyo, who said
that reduction of the trade deficit with Japan was one of his highest
priorities.
Many dealers are convinced that the currency will break the Y100 level soon,
although there are expectations that the new Japanese government could order
a cut in the Official Discount Rate at its cabinet meeting on Thursday.
Sterling fell back sharply on all fronts yesterday, partly hindered by
D-Mark strength but also by perceptions that the UK's economic data earlier
this week were worse than expected. there is bullish talk in UK money
markets about a near-term cut in base rates. The pound closed at DM2.4975,
down 2 pfennigs on the day.

FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Daiwa Bank rescues brokerage
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIWA BANK has stepped in to rescue Cosmo Securities, a second-tier Japanese
broker which yesterday reported an extraordinary loss of Y69.8bn (Dollars
677m) due to tobashi, or manipulation of its clients' accounts.
Daiwa will become the first bank to hold a stockbroking subsidiary, even
though Japanese banks are not yet permitted to own brokerages.
Osaka-based Daiwa, a leading creditor of Cosmo, will inject between Y70bn
and Y80bn through an emergency third-party share allotment. It will in
effect acquire over 50 per cent of the broker, whose liabilities exceeded
total assets by Y7.1bn, paralysing its operations.
Concern among the financial authorities was highlighted by a hastily-called
press conference by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister.
Mr Fujii stressed the importance of Cosmo's rescue to prevent any confusion
on the stock market and to protect Cosmo's employees.
However, the revelations may hit the Tokyo stock market, which has
stabilised after a three-year decline that stemmed partly from scandals
involving brokers' links with gangsters, stock price manipulation and
compensations to favoured customers.
Ministry of Finance officials admitted they had not known of transactions
which started in 1987, and of the extensive losses Cosmo suffered when it
could not find new homes for the accounts of some 20 clients.
Last year, the ministry reprimanded Cosmo in a separate case involving
tobashi, transferring loss-making stocks from client account to client
account in an attempt to avoid booking the loss.
The finance ministry has drawn up plans to investigate the country's 48
brokers, although it maintained Cosmo was likely to be an isolated case.
However, it is unlikely that Cosmo will be able to distribute dividends on
its stocks, and the move is expected to be a financial burden on Daiwa,
which plans to use its own funds for the bail-out.
Moody's, the investment rating agency, said it placed under review for
possible downgrade both long- and short-term ratings of Daiwa Bank and its
guaranteed subsidiaries, in response to the bank's announcement that it
would acquire Cosmo Securities, AP-DJ reports.
About Dollars 1.4bn of long-term debt is affected, the agency said.

Revenues declined to FFr1.47bn (Dollars 243m) in the three months to June 30
(the third quarter) from FFr1.5bn in the same period last year.
However, the slight reduction in revenue for the period disguises the
severity of the deterioration in the group's underlying performance, given
that the theme park did not trade for the full quarter last year. It did not
open until April 12 1992.
Euro Disney recently announced it had asked Walt Disney, its US parent, for
financial support while it attempted to restructure debt.
It warned of a net loss of FFr500m for the third quarter and yesterday said
that it had 'no reason' to change that estimate.
Analysts now expect a net loss of between FFr1.8bn and FFr2bn for the full
financial year to September 30.
The group, which initially hoped to be profitable from its opening year, has
already recorded a net loss of FFr1.08bn for the six months to March 31,
after losing FFr339m in the previous year.
The deterioration in Euro Disney's performance during the third quarter is
particularly grave, given that the spring months should be one of the
busiest periods for the park.
Euro Disneyland has been dogged by the European recession, which has led to
a slight shortfall in the number of visitors to the park and in the amount
of money they spend.
The group has faced the additional problem of the strong franc in the
current financial year, which began just after last September's currency
crisis.
As a result, foreign attendance has fallen sharply. The number of visitors
from the UK, previously one of its strongest markets, fell by 50 per cent to
310,000 in the first half.
But Euro Disney said bookings from outside France had already responded to
the franc's recent weakness following this month's reform of the European
exchange rate mechanism. It had detected an improvement in business from the
UK and Spain.
The company also hopes to benefit from cost-cutting. The number of employees
has been reduced from 18,580 on July 31 last year to 15,875 at the same date
this year, mainly through cuts in its permanent workforce.

FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ferfin stock recovers on
speculative buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company which is
staggering under total borrowings of L28,838bn (Dollars 17.8bn), staged a
strong recovery in its share price on the Milan stock exchange yesterday.
On the second day of trading after Tuesday's two-day suspension, Ferfin
shares soared by 46 per cent to close at L328.
Stock in Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial subsidiary, climbed by almost
5 per cent to L736.60.
Trading in Ferfin shares was suspended earlier this week in advance of news
of revised losses for the first five months of this year and plans to write
down the nominal share price to L5 from L1,000.
The impact of the write-down and scale of the problems at the group, which
is labouring under allegations of political corruption, severe financial
irregularities and vast debts, made it virtually impossible for analysts to
judge a fair share price when trading in the shares resumed on Thursday.
Dealers said that yesterday's strong recovery in the group's share price -
which followed an official price of L224.40 on Thursday - was partly
speculative.
Trading was also fuelled by some upbeat forecasts for the fate of Ferfin's
shares when its main creditor banks unveil their rescue plan next month.

<TEXT>
WERELDHAVE, the second-largest property company in the Netherlands after
Rodamco, said its managing board chairman Mr Meindert Kooistra was
resigning.
The group cited differences of opinion with the supervisory board about
company policy and structure.
Mr Gijs Verweij, the company's second board member, will assume his duties
while a search is made for a new member of the board. At a later stage a
decision will be taken on which of the two board members will become
chairman, a company spokesman said.
He declined to be drawn on the reasons for Mr Kooistra's departure.
Wereldhave's shares did not react to news of the resignation, closing
unchanged on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange at Fl 111.20.
Mr Kooistra joined Wereldhave as its chairman in 1990 after the similarly
abrupt departure of his predecessor, Mr Onno Huskens, who had spearheaded
the company's successful hostile takeover of Peachey Properties of the UK in
1988.
Koninklijke Frans Maas, the Dutch road transport group, warned that its 1993
result would be worse than forecast, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
Frans Maas had said in January that 1993 profits would be much lower than
the Fl 36.5m (Dollars 18.83m) posted in 1992.
The company said the recession in Europe would have a bigger impact on the
turnover and results than was expected at the beginning of the year.
In January, Frans Maas, 32 per cent owned by KLM, said it expected profits
to fall because of lower income from customs activities.

EASTMAN Kodak, the US photographic equipment group, has announced further
moves among its senior executives, one week after independent directors
ousted Mr Kay Whitmore as chairman.
Kodak's board said that it was appointing Mr Michael Hamilton as general
comptroller of the group with effect from September 1, when Mr Julian Gordon
retires.
Mr Hamilton will also continue to be the company's acting chief financial
officer, a post he has held since May when Mr Christopher Steffen quit after
disagreeing with Mr Whitmore over Kodak's restructuring plans.
Kodak also announced the resignation of Mr Earnest Deavenport, president of
the Eastman Chemical Company, as a Kodak director.
The company said the move was expected because of the previously-announced
plan to spin off the chemicals arm.
Mr Deavenport, who will head the new independent company, joined the Kodak
board in May 1992.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SILVIO Berlusconi Editore, the publishing house owned by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group, has launched its expected share exchange offer
for Mondadori, Italy's biggest publisher.
The deal - effectively a reverse takeover of Mondadori by SBE - will allow
Mr Berlusconi to gain an immediate quotation for his hitherto-unlisted
publishing interests.
Once completed, Fininvest, which already owns most of Mondadori, is expected
to float a minority of the capital in SBE-Mondadori to raise about L550bn
(Dollars 340m) in order to lower its debts.
Separately, it is expected that Fininvest, which had total net debts of
L3,333bn at the end of last year, will later this month issue its first
comprehensive balance sheet.
The figures may provide additional ammunition in the battle between Mr
Berlusconi and his critics over the size of the group's borrowings.
Mondadori raised group sales by 9.8 per cent to L919bn in the first half of
this year, from L837bn, while net profits amounted to L25.4bn. SBE's
first-half sales were L184.8bn, while profits were L15.8bn. Aggregate 1992
figures for the two companies show sales of L1,851bn and net profits of
L50.9bn.
Shareholders in Mondadori will be offered one SBE ordinary share for every
ordinary share held, while holders of Mondadori savings stock will receive
three SBE ordinary shares for every four shares they own.
If all Mondadori shareholders accept the deal, Fininvest will own about 87.5
per cent of SBE, which will in turn wholly own Mondadori.
How much Fininvest will be able to raise by floating shares in SBE-Mondadori
will depend on market conditions and the timing of the deal. Mr Berlusconi
has indicated that the placing will occur before the end of this year and a
substantial proportion of the shares are expected to be offered abroad.
Banca Commerciale Italiana and Goldman Sachs are advising on the
transaction.

FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sales fall at French groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, Michelin and Suez have underlined the financial pressures on
French industry by announcing sharp falls in turnover for the first half of
the year.
The reductions in interim sales reflect the general trend across the French
corporate sector, which has been badly hit by the recession. Domestic
difficulties were aggravated by the franc's strength during the first half
of the year, which posed problems for French exporters.
Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals company which was recently
confirmed as one of the first candidates for privatisation, saw sales fall
by 6 per cent to FFr40.03bn (Dollars 6.8bn) in the first six months of 1993,
from FFr42.56bn in the same period of 1992.
Suez, the holding company with extensive interests across industry and
finance which was privatised in the mid-1980s, reported a 1 per cent decline
in interim turnover to FFr89.86bn this year from FFr90.51bn last year.
Michelin, the tyre maker struggling to rationalise in response to the
slowdown in the international motor industry, suffered a more dramatic fall
in sales, down 12 per cent to FFr30.61bn from FFr34.8bn over the same
period.
Bouygues and Lafarge Coppee, two of France's leading construction companies,
were also hit by sales declines. Bouygues, the building group, saw sales
fall by 6 per cent to FFr28.1bn in the first half from FFr30.03bn in the
same period of 1992, while Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, saw
a 5 per cent reduction in interim turnover to FFr14.28bn from FFr15.06bn.
A few large companies have managed to buck the downward trend. The L'Oreal
cosmetics group saw sales rise by 7 per cent to FFr20.89bn in the first half
of this year from FFr19.5bn last time. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the utility
and construction company, kept interim sales growth just above inflation
with an increase of 4 per cent to FFr45.64bn from FFr43.86bn.

<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa and the Li family have sold their holding in News
Corporation for USDollars 288.4m, less than three weeks after the shares
were received as part-payment for the sale of 64 per cent of Star
Television.
The Hong Kong investors made a profit of 10 per cent on the 6.27m News Corp
American Depositary Receipts, which were sold at Dollars 46 each. The
placement represented half of the proceeds from the Dollars 525m sale of the
Asian satellite broadcaster.
The transaction had been expected, since News Corp shares have performed
strongly following the Star deal and represent a low-yielding investment
with a potential currency risk.
Hutchison has now raised HKDollars 2.15bn (USDollars 277m) in cash from its
investment in Star, which will help fund the group's ambitious foray into UK
telecommunications.
Around HKDollars 1.5bn of the proceeds will be taken as an extraordinary
profit, and will help offset expected provisions against Hutchison's Rabbit
UK cordless telephone network.
The Hutchison share price rose 80 cents to HKDollars 22.40 yesterday. Mr
Adrian Faure, research director at Baring Securities, said: 'This is
positive news. It adds HKDollars 100m to the bottom line from a trading
profit, and Hutchison has now received all of the cash from the
transaction.'
Hutchison and the Li family remain partners with News Corp through their
remaining 36 per cent stake in Star. They have said this will be retained as
a long-term investment.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold market bulls
undismayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD MARKET bulls were not ready to throw in the towel this week as the
metal's price retreated further following the dramatic sell-off that ended
the recent upsurge. But there was less talk of the Dollars 40 plunge from
last week's post-Gulf war high being nothing more than 'a healthy
correction' to an overdone rise.
As the London bullion market price clambered back above Dollars 370 a troy
ounce yesterday morning, after Thursday's after-hours fall below Dollars
365, GNI, the London trade house, suggested that a close above Dollars 370
an ounce for the October position in New York would signal that the latest
fall, which resulted from a heavy bout of US investment fund selling, had
been a 'bear trap'.
'We would therefore be cautious buyers at current levels,' GNI said in its
daily Commodity Report. 'The long-term position is still good.'
Less confident was the trader who told the Reuter news agency he thought a
fall through Dollars 365 an ounce in London would mean 'the rally's all
over'. But others believed that even in the event of a fall to Dollars 360,
fundamental factors would underpin the price and provide a solid base for a
slow climb back.
The week had started with a Dollars 5.75 bounce in the London market to
Dollars 382.25 an ounce, largely in response to the return of Swiss and Far
Eastern buyers. But concerted efforts on Tuesday to consolidate the market
above the Dollars 380 mark had to be abandoned and from mid-week investment
fund liquidation began to add to the downward pressure in an unstable market
that dealers said was still suffering the 'aftershock' of last week's late
plunge.
The subsequent recovery appeared to have run out of steam by yesterday
lunch-time and the London price closed at Dollars 368.75 an ounce, up
Dollars 3.90 from the low but still Dollars 7.75 down on the week. In late
trading at the New York Commodity Exchange, however, the October futures
position was trading at Dollars 370 an ounce, the target level identified by
GNI.
If GNI is cautiously bullish about gold, there is nothing cautious about its
view of prospects for the cocoa market. In the latest issue of its Cocoa
Outlook report, published yesterday, it said that declining stocks,
continuing consumption growth and doubts about future output pointed to the
development of 'the most exciting bull market for some time' over the next
few seasons.
It suggested a rerun of the 'massive' bull market of the 1970s was not out
of the question, with the average cocoa price surging from Pounds 745 a
tonne this year to Pounds 1,600 in 1994 and Pounds 2,700 in 1995.
'Ultimately the rally should peter out close to the July 1977 second
(futures) position high of Pounds 3,512 a tonne,' GNI said.
The report included a forecast of a world cocoa supply deficit of 241,000
tonnes in 1993-94 and that tended to encourage buyers. But the resulting
early upward move in the London futures market was wiped out in response to
a strengthening of sterling and there was little sign that the market was
yet in the mood for a bull run on the scale envisaged by GNI. The December
futures price ended at Pounds 761 a tonne, down Pounds 1 on the day and up
Pounds 7 on the week.
The London robusta coffee market has been much more volatile than the cocoa
market of late, and this week was no exception. As the market sought a new
trading level following the violent fluctuations caused in recent weeks by
the ebb and flow of Brazilian frost fears the November futures price
see-sawed between Dollars 1,100 and Dollars 1,150 a tonne, before closing
yesterday at Dollars 1,121 a tonne, up just Dollars 7 on the week.
With the Brazilian frost scare season almost over most attention is focusing
again on the Latin American coffee producers export retention scheme. The
growing credibility of this effort to bring the world market into better
balance by withholding 20 per cent of scheduled exports from the market
brought the London coffee price close to the Dollars 1,000-a-tonne mark
before the Brazilian weather took up the baton several weeks ago. Some
doubts about the likely effectiveness of the scheme resurfaced this week but
in general coffee dealers still held the view that, rather than face a
renewed price collapse, leading producers would not stint in their efforts
to make export restrictions stick.
Talks are to be held in Kampala next week on extending the scheme to African
producing countries, and this was offered as an explanation for the relative
steadiness of the London market, which trades the robusta coffee grown
mostly in Africa, compared with the weakness of the New York market, which
trades Latin American-type arabicas.
At the London Metal Exchange technical tightness continued to obscure the
fundamental weakness of the copper market, despite the exchange management's
warning two weeks ago that it would take draconian action to prevent serious
distortion of the market by operators attempting to manipulate prices. The
cash premium over three months delivery copper, which ended last week at
Dollars 17 a tonne, stood at Dollars 40 as at yesterday's close.
The aluminium market passed another unwelcome milestone this week when the
stocks total in LME warehouse moved above the 2m tonne mark. But there was
no noticeable market reaction and the three months price rallied by Dollars
12.50 from Wednesday's low to end at Dollars 1,207.25 a tonne, down Dollars
15.25 on the week.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Wm Baird acquires Racke for Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM BAIRD, the textile manufacturer, has become Britain's third largest
supplier to high street retailer Marks and Spencer with the acquisition of
Richard I Racke, the ladies' wear and casual clothing company, for an
initial Pounds 17.8m.
The market welcomed the move and Baird's shares closed 15p higher at 275p.
Mr Nicholas Webster, chief executive of Baird Textiles, the main subsidiary,
said the deal would enhance earnings immediately. Racke would contribute
more than four months profits to the current year.
He stressed that Baird was not 'wholly dependent' on Marks and Spencer with
a maximum of 30 per cent of its annual sales going to the retailer.
Mr Webster said the deal would yield some cost savings: 'Like Baird, Racke's
factories are located in Scotland and the north east of England. We will be
looking to gain better efficiencies and factory utilisation.'
Mr Donald Parr, Baird's chairman, said: 'Racke is a design-led business with
modern, flexible production facilities. The linkage with Racke will provide
significant synergy benefits and extends the company's interest in fast
growing areas of ladies' casual wear.'
For the year to end-December 1992 Racke made pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.75m, after non-recurring charges, on turnover of Pounds 29.1m. Net assets
at year-end were Pounds 4.6m, before deduction of a dividend of Pounds 4m
paid this month.
Consideration is being satisfied via the allotment of 683,594 shares, Pounds
14.8m in guaranteed loan notes and Pounds 1.18m cash. There is an additional
profit-related consideration of up to Pounds 3m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New London, the UK quoted oil and gas exploration and production company
which operates in the US, has finally agreed terms for the sale of its
International Drilling Fluids unit to Schlumberger of the US.
In May the UK company signed a letter of intent with Schlumberger which
involved the US energy services company taking a 10 per cent stake in the
vendor, but New London cancelled the deal last month when it received
revised terms.
Under the latest agreement, New London will receive Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m)
cash, subject to adjustments, for IDF, which will be sold with Dollars 30m
of bank debt.
New London, which bought IDF two years ago for Dollars 21m, said proceeds
would be used to remove virtually all of the group's existing bank
borrowings.

Pounds 2.5m by a rights issue to reduce debt and provide a firmer capital
base for expansion.
The company also reported a turnround from losses of Pounds 564,000 to

The shares closed down 3p yesterday at 91p.
Directors said that as the effects of recession diminished consumer
confidence would continue to strengthen. The trend in net reservations was
encouraging, the company said, with 220 in the first seven months of 1993
against 216 for the whole of 1992.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 was Pounds 9.46m (Pounds 8.08m).

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Unit tumbles and incurs Pounds 388,013
losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT Group, the USM-quoted maker of timber pallets, tumbled to Pounds
388,013 in the red for the year ended March 31. Last time there were pre-tax
profits of Pounds 138,971.
Mr John Adams, the chairman, said the results were a great disappointment
and reflected the extremely difficult conditions in the pallet industry.
The main problems were the fall in volumes as a consequence of recession on
its customers and an increase in the cost of timber as a result of the fall
in the value of sterling.
Turnover declined to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 21.2m) and operating losses
amounted to Pounds 67,347 (Pounds 650,930 profits).
The pre-tax result was after interest and similar charges of Pounds 320,666
(Pounds 511,959).
Losses per share emerged at 6.3p against earnings of 0.8p.
Although trading losses had continued into the current year, Mr Adams said
the board had and would continue to take action to restore profitability as
soon as possible.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Medeva shareholder sues over trading
statements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAREHOLDER in Medeva, the drugs group which recently saw its shares
halved following a profits warning, is suing the company and its directors
over allegedly misleading trading statements.
The group's shares fell a further 11 1/2 p to 95 1/2 p on the announcement.
Analysts greeted the news with a weary resignation after a month in which
the shares have fallen from a peak of 216p. 'This sort of thing is certainly
not helping the cause,' said one.
The shares fell sharply last month when the group warned its profits would
be some Pounds 10m less than expectations of Pounds 55m to Pounds 57m. The
warning came just three months after the group had launched a Pounds 94m
1-for-4 rights issue at 180p.
The company said yesterday that it was too early to indicate the possible
ramifications. The plaintiff had not specified the level of damages sought.
However, it said it had been advised that such class action suits following
a sharp decline in a company's share price were a common occurrence in the
US.
In general, the company said, such actions were settled out of court.
However, Medeva was determined to oppose all claims in this case.
The shareholder has launched a class action suit, aimed at representing US
investors who bought American Depositary Receipts between January 14 and
July 19, the date of the profits warning. It has been estimated that some 2m
shares were traded during that period.
The investor alleges that Medeva and some directors violated US securities
laws by failing to warn the stock market of the group's impending troubles
and being over-optimistic about prospects.
Specific reference is made to comments by the company at the time of the
merger with Armstrong Pharmaceuticals of the US in January, and at the time
of the rights issue in April. The action has been lodged against all but two
directors, the company and its main US subsidiary.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Unilever ahead of City forecasts - Second
quarter advance of 7% leaves half year result at Pounds 984m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, lived up to its
reputation for dependability yesterday with a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits for the second quarter to end-June.
The rise was the same as that in the first quarter, and the company said it
expected the performance to be maintained in the second half.
The results were slightly better than market expectations, and the shares
rose 11p to 986p.
The rise to Pounds 564m against Pounds 526m, makes Pounds 984m (Pounds 919m)
for the half year. The increase was at constant exchange rates and Unilever
said its net profit - up 8 per cent on the same basis - was up 21 per cent
if recalculated at current exchange rates, thus giving effect to sterling's
devaluation last September.
Mr Michael Perry, the chairman, said the performance was much weaker in the
US and Europe than in the rest of the world. US operating profit for the
quarter was down 8 per cent, mostly because of increased competition in
detergents and pasta sauces, while European profit was down 1 per cent. He
added that in the rest of the world, profit was up 45 per cent.
This was partly due to the full consolidation of Brooke Bond and Lipton in
India, and the Dollars 284m (Pounds 190m) acquisition of the Cica
tomato-based food business in Brazil. However, Unilever said there were
widespread increases in sales and profits outside the US and Europe, and its
operations in Japan, lossmaking for some years, were on target to break even
this year.
In the second quarter, operating margins in Europe fell from 9.7 per cent to
9.4 per cent, and in the US from 6.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Margins in
the rest of the world rose sharply from 8.2 per cent to 9.6 per cent.
Sales in the first half were up 6 per cent. Unilever said the increase was
made up of 2.5 per cent extra sales volume, 2.5 per cent increased prices
and 1 per cent from acquisitions net of disposals.
Acquisitions in the period contributed Pounds 31m of operating profit on
sales of Pounds 285m. In the first half of 1992 subsequently discontinued
operations accounted for Pounds 200m of turnover and Pounds 7m operating
profit.
Partly as a result of the acquisition programme, interim net debt was Pounds
1.925bn, compared with about Pounds 1.5bn the year before.
Group sales for the second quarter and half year respectively were Pounds
6.66bn (Pounds 6.31bn) and Pounds 12.69bn (Pounds 11.94bn). Operating profit
was Pounds 585m (Pounds 548m) and Pounds 1.03bn (Pounds 967m). Interest
payments net of investment income came to Pounds 21m (Pounds 22m) and Pounds
44m (Pounds 48m). Earnings per share, at current exchange rates, were 20.58p
(16.98p) and 36.38p (30.07p).
The interim dividend will be declared with the third quarter results in
November.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Scottish TV plans sale or flotation of its
Pauline Hyde offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Television said yesterday that it would either float or sell
Pauline Hyde &amp; Associates, its outplacement and career development
subsidiary, before the end of 1998.
A new management team had been appointed at PHA and a review of the future
strategy of STV's investment in the offshoot had been undertaken.
These moves followed a 'disappointing profit performance' of PHA in the
opening six months of 1993. For 1992 the company returned pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds 12m.
Directors of STV said PHA would be listed on the London Stock Exchange or be
sold privately 'at a significant premium to its current value'. In that
event Diplema, a company controlled by Mr Colyn Gardner and Mr Mark Allsup,
and the new management team would be entitled, on a listing, to acquire up
to 40 per cent of PHA's share capital.
Mr Gardner, Mr Allsup and Mr Max Nicholson, majority shareholders in
Fairplace Consulting, the outplacement and training consultancy in the City,
have joined PHA as executive chairman, chief executive and executive
director respectively.
Diplema and the new management team will have the right to acquire PHA from
STV in 1999 if a listing or sale is not achieved. STV's shares dipped 5p to
524p.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: British Syphon suffers margin pressure and
lower interest income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest received and pressure on margins hit British Syphon
Industries, the industrial group, in the first half of 1993. It reported a
13 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3m, against
Pounds 2.62m.
Mr Brian Morrall, chairman, poured cold water on talk of an end to recession
in the short term. BSI had not seen 'any material change in the economic
climate'. In fact, the outlook remained uncertain with one of BSI's largest
markets in Germany.
Group sales were 11 per cent lower at Pounds 17.6m, depressed by the
disposal of two businesses which contributed sales of Pounds 2.88m to the
comparable turnover of Pounds 19.7m. Operating profits of continuing
operations were 13 per cent down at Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.46m).
Interest revenue fell by 33 per cent to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.5m). Earlier
this month BSI paid a special dividend of 62.35p, as a way of distributing
the bulk of its Pounds 33m cash mountain, leaving net cash of Pounds 11m. An
interim dividend is not being paid against 2p last time.
Mr Morrall said failure to reach agreement with Britannia, its 69.39 per
cent parent, over a suitable acquisition had resulted in the special
payment.
Earnings per share were 0.2p lower at 4.5p.
Newton Mill, the property management company owned by BSI, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 16,000 to Pounds 52,000 in the six months ended June 30.
Turnover improved to Pounds 75,000 (Pounds 40,000). After tax of Pounds
17,000 (Pounds 5,000) earnings per share worked through at 4.4p against
1.4p.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: CWB pays Pounds 285m for Swedish flooring
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and CHRIS BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CWB CAPITAL Partners, a London-based acquisition fund, is buying Tarkett, an
international flooring company, for SKr3.4bn (Pounds 285m).
The purchase, from Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, is another
acquisition for CWB's North European Acquisition Fund, which focuses on
large, international businesses based in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia.
Mr Richard Hanson, who runs CWB's London office, has acquired European
market leaders with an international spread of earnings.
Earlier this year CWB bought B&amp;L, one of the world's leading suppliers of
dosing pumps, industrial analysers and electronics for industrial weighting.
In 1990 it bought Swedish-based ARJO Group, the world's largest supplier of
hygiene, transport and lifting equipment for hospital patients.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora's president, said the disposal reflected the
group's desire to concentrate on its core forestry business and its wish to
strengthen its balance sheet. He also described the sale as 'a good long
term solution for Tarkett' as CWB is a 'financial buyer who will keep the
company intact'.
The disposal is expected to produce a capital gain of around SKr800m for
Stora, and strengthen its equity/assets ratio from 29 per cent to 31 per
cent.
Tarkett was acquired by Stora in 1988 as part of a larger acquisition of the
Swedish Match group. Last year Tarkett produced an operating income of
SKr266m on turnover of SKr5.3bn.
The company has manufacturing operations in Sweden, Germany, Ireland and the
US, producing 100m square metres of flooring products a year. Mr Helgesson
says this makes it one of the world's top three producers of flooring.
The company's main markets are western Europe and the US, which account for
97 per cent of sales. It has 4,800 employees.
Tarkett is expected to make a profit of SKr325m this year - which Stora will
keep as part of the overall sale price - compared with SKr266m last year.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Portmeirion 12% up at Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS before tax of Portmeirion Potteries (Holdings) rose to Pounds 1.59m
for the six months ended June 30, an improvement of 12 per cent over last
time's Pounds 1.42m.
The figures benefited from a sharp reduction in interest charges to Pounds
27,000 (Pounds 220,000), which reflected lower interest rates on lower bank
borrowings.
Turnover for the opening half year increased from Pounds 10.43m to Pounds
11.37m but at the operating level profits were static at Pounds 1.54m having
been adversely affected by difficulties experienced in the installation of
new glazing equipment.
Earnings per share rose from 8.89p to 9.88p and the interim dividend is a
same-again 2.25p.
Looking ahead, the directors said some export markets remained difficult.
They added, however, that the major markets in the UK and the US were
'performing well' and that profit margins were expected to improve now that
production difficulties were being overcome.
The shares rose 4p to 399p.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Low confidence leaves Haden MacLellan down
at Pounds 1.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HADEN MacLellan Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday highlighted
low customer confidence in capital projects, as it reported a decline in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.8m in the six months to June
30.
The board is holding the interim dividend at 1p, covered by earnings down at
1.3p (1.5p).
Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said: 'Buyers have felt less confident about
investing in capital projects and, as some of our products are of a capital
nature, order opportunities have been restricted.'
He said confidence in the UK and the US was increasing, but that economic
recovery was slow. The recession continued in continental Europe.
The depressed profits were struck on turnover up at Pounds 152.7m (Pounds
141.9m) as margins suffered under competitive pressure but volume improved.
All divisions traded profitably. Operating profits in manufacturing and
distribution fell to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 2.2m) hit by continuing uncertainty
in the UK economy, the company said.
In process engineering and services, operating profits were maintained at
Pounds 1.1m, disguising a drop to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 3.5m) in Europe and
the Australia and profits of Pounds 500,000, against losses of Pounds 2.4m,
in the US.
Mr Cottam said: 'Our attention to the growing south east Asia market has
been rewarded with substantial new business, although this has not matched
the downturn in our traditional markets.'
There were property operating profits of Pounds 200,000, against losses of
Pounds 300,000.
Mr Cottam said the next property revaluation was due at December 31. 'It is
not possible to predict what impact this may have although it is possible in
the current climate that it may give rise to some reduction in carrying
values.'
The net interest charge was maintained at Pounds 300,000 on 'modest'
borrowings. At the end of the period there was net cash of Pounds 1m (Pounds
1.2m).

Sir, My wholehearted appreciation of Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint ('

An independent central bank is certainly essential, but why should we stop

Sir, Recent reporting on the number of company liquidations this year seems
to ignore the fact that it is government departments which seem to be
causing the mayhem. In a recent issue of Stubbs Gazette dated Friday July
23, under the section 'Petitions presented', one page alone contained 131
reports - there were 84 from HM Commissioners of Customs &amp; Excise and four
from the Inland Revenue. The majority on other pages were just the same, but
I lost count.
Would not some flexibility on the payment of VAT by small firms dramatically
reduce the number of liquidations?

FT  14 AUG 93 / Light goes out in the tunnel of hope: The quickening pace of
pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than five months have passed since the UK government completed its coal
review and raised the industry's hopes with promises to save a dozen pits
from closure.
But now British Coal is on the point of shutting down a number of the 12
pits, and others will go soon afterwards. More damaging still for the
government, a further seven or so of what were previously regarded as 19
core pits also seem doomed. That will leave a rump of barely a dozen pits
with a long-term future out of the 50 that British Coal had in operation
this time last year.
This decline in the industry's fortunes will shock and confuse backbench MPs
and the general public, whose outrage at the original closure plans forced
the government to undertake its review last year, and who believed that many
pits had been saved as a result.
Were they deceived by ministers? Or has further bad news hit the coal
industry since March? Is this evidence that the government has broken its
promises to give coal a better chance to compete with other forms of energy
such as gas and nuclear power?
The reality is that the white paper made few promises. In spite of
ministers' efforts to present themselves as the saviours of some pits, the
white paper never offered more than a breathing space for the industry to
rationalise gradually.
The six-month review rejected one by one the radical measures put forward by
pressure groups to make room in the market for the fuel: for example,
cutting back the state-owned nuclear industry's electricity output or
slowing down the so-called 'dash for gas'.
The government was thus left with measures which could only affect the
margins of the electricity market where most coal goes. Some of the white
paper's provisions and calculations proved to have less substance than the
government suggested. A prediction by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary,
that production of orimulsion, a bitumen-based substance, would fall by
500,000 tonnes a year, perplexed the fuel's importers. They believe sales
will remain steady.
Mr Heseltine appeared to offer firmer support with his promise of up to
Pounds 500m in subsidies to British Coal if it could agree sales to the
electricity generators over and above contracts already confirmed. Five
months later, not a penny has been claimed, either by British Coal or the
private operators which are also entitled to subsidies.
The money is still on offer. But National Power and PowerGen, the
generators, with 34m tonnes of coal stocks, more than three times their
needs, have shown scant interest in buying more. They have little incentive.
First, both companies have faced a stronger than expected challenge to their
market shares from nuclear power and from the gas-fired stations of rival
competitors. Second, the government has made little progress in its talks
with the generators on the amount of coal stocks they are required to hold
by law, even though the white paper described the consultations as 'a matter
of urgency'.
Against this background, British Coal has almost finished a 'market-testing'
exercise - government jargon for studying whether the market can sustain the
12 reprieved pits. Although the exercise will end only when the generators
decide on additional purchases, probably in the autumn, there is little
reason for optimism about securing extra sales.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, expects the generators to buy fewer
than 8m tonnes of additional coal this financial year and next, with most of
it being bought after next March. Additional sales to industrial and
household markets are likely to be limited.
This leaves British Coal with some simple calculations on which to base the
pit closures programme which it has yet to finalise. In the year from next
March the likely market for sales of British Coal's deep-mines will amount
to about 33m tonnes at most, assuming the more profitable opencast
operations contribute about 12m.
However, current annual production of the corporation's 30 remaining deep
mines is at least 44m tonnes. That leaves an imbalance between output and
sales next year of at least 11m tonnes.
The problems do not end there. Annual productivity improvements of about 30
per cent mean that next year's sales will be more than met by the 19 core
pits. Meanwhile, over-production could increase British Coal's stockpiles to
about 20m tonnes. That represents more than four times what British Coal
wants. But it also represents a threat to the government's privatisation
plans. The higher the coal stocks, the less the incentive for private sector
operators to mine coal in the future.
Although last winter's pit closures furore delayed privatisation, it
actually fortified the government's resolve to sell off the corporation.
Ministers want to get rid of a direct connection with an industry which
often presents them with awkward political problems. They also believe the
private sector offers the industry the best chance of becoming competitive.
However, the private sector is unlikely to be keen to invest in a producer
which is too large for the market. It is also uncertain which purchaser will
want to take on such a politically charged and problematic industry. Hanson
and RTZ are the UK companies with the most relevant international experience
to tackle British Coal but neither has declared an interest.
Nevertheless, the government is determined to find a buyer, and that is why
it is keen to get British Coal into commercial shape. Ministers must
therefore be tempted to agree with the corporation that the best solution is
to implement pit closures quickly, with as many as 15 before next April. The
final decision on timing will rest on whether ministers believe the
backbench Tory MPs who threatened to vote against them last October are
still in the mood to rebel.

FT  14 AUG 93 / The weaver's tale: A boost for the makers of Harris Tweed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A modern loom powered by a weaver pedalling like a cyclist is arguably the
most encouraging thing the Harris Tweed industry has seen for decades. The
loom, one of the first of many that will be installed on the Western Isles
off the coast of Scotland next year, should help revive an industry that has
been in steep decline.
'The new loom is far less effort to work than the old one, yet it is
producing twice as much cloth for that effort. And it makes much less
racket,' says Mr Callum Maclean, a weaver at Point of Ness on the island of
Lewis.
The new loom should also help improve the economy of the Western Isles,
where the population is falling and which two years ago faced criticism when
its council lost Pounds 23m in the collapse of the Bank for Credit and
Commerce International.
At the heart of the weavers' woes has been their much-loved and now
out-dated treadle-driven Hattersley looms, which produces cloth with a width
of 75cm. Most clothing manufacturers worldwide demand fabric with a width of
150cm, the industry standard. The island weavers were increasingly out of
step with the garment industry, and the big manufacturers' refusal to adjust
their machine settings for Harris Tweed threatened the existence of a craft
dating back to the mid-19th century.
But now there is hope: the new lightweight loom, which produces Harris Tweed
with a width of 150cm, could transform the industry. Mr Aneas Maclean, a
weaver from the village of Garynahine in the Western Isles, calls the loom
'a lifeline for the industry'.
The mills and weavers are embarking on a five-year Pounds 9.5m programme to
re-equip themselves. About 45 per cent of the funding will come from the
industry itself, including the weavers, and the rest from Western Isles
Enterprise (the local offshoot of Highlands and Islands Enterprise) and from
the European Community.
Some Pounds 5m will be spent on buying the new looms, Pounds 2m on adapting
the mills to the new width and Pounds 2m on marketing; Pounds 500,000 will
be spent on training the weavers.
'It has taken a crisis to bring the industry together and listen to what
we'd been telling it,' says the Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
Each new loom will cost about Pounds 13,000. The weaver is expected to
contribute Pounds 4,000 with the rest coming from grants. The first 100
looms, arriving on Lewis at a rate of two a week, should be in operation by
the end of next year, and the first 150cm Harris Tweed could be produced for
the 1994-95 selling season.
Harris Tweed is one of Scotland's most famous home-grown products. Often
thick, always hard-wearing and usually woven in sober browns and greens,
reflecting the bleak Hebridean landscape, it has been popular for
generations with the British gentry and rich Americans.
What makes the tweed unique is that it is produced from pure wool in the
Western Isles and woven in the homes of the weavers. Only if these
conditions are met does it receive the stamp of authenticity from the Harris
Tweed Authority, the industry regulator, and command a premium price.
All the other processes in weaving the tweed, from spinning and dying the
wool to finishing the cloth, take place in four textile mills on Lewis.
Having spun the yarn, the mills pass it on to self-employed weavers who
their Hattersley machines in sheds adjoining their houses.
Using outworkers gives Harris Tweed its unique quality: each tweed receives
the personal attention of a weaver and helps sustain a cottage industry.
Weavers' jobs have been one of the main casualties of the crisis in the
industry since 1987 when fashion in men's clothing moved from woven jackets
to knitted pullovers. Harris Tweed's sales in its biggest market - men's
sports jackets in the US - fell sharply. Output dropped from 5m metres of
tweed in 1985 to about 1m metres last year (worth only Pounds 5.5m). The
number of weavers has fallen to 400, from about 2,000 in the 1960s.
The crisis forced the industry to examine itself. A working party formed by
the mills and weavers found that potential consumers were put off by the
cloth's rough texture and heaviness. Jackets of 12-ounce tweed last for
decades but, as Mr Harris Mackenzie, managing director of Kenneth Mackenzie,
the most modern of the mills, says: 'People no longer want to keep their
clothes that long.'
The demand for lighter and softer tweed is now being met: design changes
have produced tweeds weighing only 6 ounces a yard, and newer tweeds are
softer.
But problems associated with the fabric paled besides the impediments
associated with the weavers' anachronistic looms. A solution did not emerge
until 1990 when Mr John Griffith, a loom maker from England, produced a
prototype, foot-driven 150cm loom. The first of his machines, made by Bonas
Griffith, his textile machinery company, arrived on Lewis last year.
The new loom permits much finer patterns such as subtle checks. It also
produces softer cloth of higher quality, which should appeal to the women's
market.
Mr Ian Mackenzie, secretary of the islands' weavers association, says the
loom 'gives us a lot of the advantages of a power loom without losing the
magic of the Hebrides'.
A group of weavers is being trained to use the looms. While they are
enthusiastic about the new product, the weavers are worried about repaying
the Pounds 4,000 which they will have to borrow as their contribution
towards the cost of the looms. Most of the weavers have been on 'less than
part time work' in recent years.
Mr Ian Mackenzie of the islands' weavers association, while sympathising
with their anxieties, is confident about the future. He says that the tweed
market has turned up this year - output is expected to reach 2m metres,
nearly twice last year's figure.
But there is a lingering uncertainty. Could Harris Tweed now lose its strong
identity as the weavers use looms that can produce a wide range of cloth?
Many in the industry believe cloth weighing less than about 6 ounces should
not be classified as Harris Tweed.
There may be a further danger: as weavers find it easier to make Harris
Tweed and increase output, so the fabric may lose its exclusivity.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Squeeze on coal market has gone too far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A D J HORSLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Tony Jackson's article ('No more buried treasure', August 9) there
is much tilting at windmills and a key point is missed. This is that a
strong case exists for believing that the squeeze on the market for UK coal
has gone too far.
Many of the gas stations replacing coal-fired generation, however
financially attractive to their investors, are doubtfully economic in
national resource terms, as the trade and industry select committee has
pointed out, once pricing rivalries in the electricity sector are set aside.
Magnox stations may or may not be very cheap on an avoidable cost basis -
but how long will they continue? Further nuclear investment is likely to
cost a great deal more, despite claims to the contrary.
So the right size of the UK coal industry in national economic terms may
well be larger than the shorter-term market pressure will support at
present. Mr Jackson's argument that we can find out by 'letting each pit
operate as a separate commercial entity' ignores the strong interaction
between pits in market quality and in mining terms, as well as the market
power issue to which he alludes. The 'transitional arrangements' that Mr
Jackson suggests provide the ground for the present contracts with
electricity generators, and for the government's temporary subsidy
arrangement if market volume would allow that to function.
With the continuing reduction in operating costs of deep mines, British Coal
expects to compete fully with imported coal at inland power stations by the
mid-1990s. The pressing argument is about how many deep mines would be
competitive at that time, but would not be given a chance to be so, given
current pressure on volumes from other fuels enjoying more effective
protection in the power station market.

   From Mr PETER MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While Adrian Hewitt and Sheila Page (Letters, August 4) rightly stress
the overall economic gains to developing countries from the current General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade package, they fail to point out that these
gains will be unevenly spread. Their own work, as well as that of others,
shows that the very poorest countries may lose out.
The world's poorest countries will suffer from the erosion of the value of
their current trading preferences, higher prices for imported food, and a
decrease in bargaining power resulting from the new investment regime. Their
heavy reliance on primary products and a lack of capital, skills and
technology mean that they stand to gain little from the trade liberalisation
and a growth in world income. In our haste to conclude the Uruguay round,
let us not forget the needs of the poorest.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Still divided over calling the shots: Nato's credibility is
at stake in Sarajevo, but internal uncertainty remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato is beating its chest. For the first time in the alliance's 44-year
history it may be about to fire a shot in anger. Or again, it may not.
In the cold war it did not have to shoot. The combined military strength of
its members, pledged to treat an attack on any one of them as an attack on
all, was sufficient to ensure that no such attack took place. But the fear
of one was enough to justify the alliance in the eyes of its members.
With the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, that
is no longer the case. Nato members do not feel any immediate danger of a
direct attack on their territory. But many do fear that their security will
be jeopardised indirectly, by conflicts in eastern Europe.
Perhaps paradoxically, this feeling is strong in the country furthest away
from eastern Europe, namely the US. Americans, after all, never relied on
Nato to fend off a direct attack on their own territory. The purpose of Nato
was to ensure the security of western Europe. That being apparently
achieved, at least in the short term, many Americans now feel that Nato must
play a role in ensuring stability in eastern Europe if it is to justify its
continued existence.
That view is summed up in a currently fashionable slogan: 'out of area or
out of business'. 'Out of area' is Nato jargon for anywhere outside the
territory to which the mutual defence pact applies: that of its member
states in Europe and North America. In the past some members, notably
France, took the view that Nato should not do anything outside this area.
Now, however, all recognise that Nato has a broader role to play, especially
in eastern Europe, although as yet few existing members are willing to
enlarge the alliance itself.
Many central or east European states, headed by the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland, would like to join, but have been politely told the time is not
ripe. A sort of waiting room or annex was set up at the beginning of last
year: the North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NAC-C), in which Nato members
sit together with their former Warsaw Pact adversaries, including all the
successor states of the Soviet Union.
But membership of NAC-C does not in itself prevent conflict - as events in
Transcaucasia and other parts of the former Soviet Union amply demonstrate -
and anyway NAC-C does not include the successor states of the situation in
the former Yugoslavia, where conflict is raging close to Nato territory.
Nato's inability to bring peace to Bosnia, or to defend the Bosnians against
'ethnic cleansing' and other atrocities, has tarnished its image in many
member states, and notably in the US.
That is why last Monday's decision to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with air
strikes unless they 'lift without delay the siege of Sarajevo' is seen, both
in Washington and at Nato HQ in Brussels, as a crucial test of Nato's
credibility.
'Nato as an institution has drawn a line in the sand on this,' says a senior
Nato official. 'It has its credibility on the line.'
'Among many in this town,' says Morton Abramowitz, head of Washington's
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former US ambassador to
Turkey, 'the belief has grown up that this is a genuine crisis that can
affect the vitality of Nato. If Nato fails to act in a serious way in the
next few weeks, at a minimum by ending the siege and stopping the shelling
of Sarajevo, its future will be in serious doubt.'
Mr Abramowitz says there is growing frustration in Washington at the
obstructive attitude of some of the US's European allies, and that unnamed
but influential members of Congress have told him they will block
appropriations of funds for US forces in Europe if it continues. 'The
British role has been the worst,' he adds.
In London, officials readily concede that there have been sharp differences
of view, notably on 'the utility of the use of force, especially in Europe
in the post-cold war environment'. In terms not heard in Whitehall for some
years, they seek to present Britain's position as a mainstream European one,
while emphasising differences of perspective between Europe and the US. They
claim, for instance, that Americans think the formula that worked in Desert
Storm, Panama and Grenada should be applicable in Europe, whereas 'most of
us here don't see that approach as very helpful, and even less so when it
comes from people who are not themselves prepared to put forces on the
ground'.
'Leaving aside the Germans, who are pretty well out of this now,' says one
British policymaker, 'the Europeans have attached a high priority to the
humanitarian operation (in Bosnia) and to a negotiated settlement. The
Americans, who are not very directly involved, feel this is being used as an
excuse for inaction, that UN troops are almost hostages and that, but for
our constant hand-wringing, an application of force from the air would
somehow sort things out.'
It is clear that Britain only accepted the decision on air strikes because
it feared the effect on Nato of snubbing the US for a second time, after the
humiliating rejection of an American proposal to lift the arms embargo on
Bosnia earlier in the year.
The French position is somewhere in between. In early June, at a meeting of
the North Atlantic Council in Athens, France was pressing for air strikes to
help secure the 'safe havens' in Bosnia proclaimed by the UN Security
Council, while the US insisted on a restrictive interpretation, allowing
only for retaliation if UN troops were themselves attacked. By late July,
however, the US wanted to use air strikes to break the Serb stranglehold on
Sarajevo. It was France that insisted air strikes could only be initiated
with UN authorisation, and must be co-ordinated with the UN force on the
ground, whose commander is a Frenchman, General Jean Cot.
One interesting feature of the affair is that earlier French reservations
about Nato's 'out of area' role have vanished completely. 'Out of area or
out of business is out of date,' says one senior Nato official with evident
satisfaction. 'We're already out of area.'
This official brushed aside fears that the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, might refuse to authorise air strikes, or that the Serbs
would succeed in dividing the allies on whether they had complied with the
ultimatum or not. 'The only source of judgment now is the US,' he declared.
'If the US comes to a decision, with a credible case, I'm confident we will
prevail both in the (North Atlantic) Council and in New York.' As for the
Serbs, 'I suspect if they think they can diddle the United States on this
one they're in for a shock. No one in Washington is in any mood to be
diddled'.
Mr Abramowitz and other Washington hawks remain sceptical, however, fearing
that the Europeans will exploit the complex chain of command, intriguing
with the UN and even with doubters in the US military to delay or avoid
taking action.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Costs indicate need for a national childcare
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs HELEN JAMESON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Real cost of childcare rises steeply' (August 5), made
interesting reading, largely because the figures you quote do not correspond
to the real cost of full-time childcare in the UK. Perhaps the average
weekly spend includes part-time childcare, and hence does not give an
indication of the average cost of full-time childcare.
In the interests of informed debate on the general inaccessibility of good,
affordable childcare, against the background of the recent 'home alone'
case, I suggest that the following costs are the norm in London:
Full-time nursery, Pounds 60-Pounds 184 a week, with most nurseries charging
in excess of Pounds 130 a week for children under two years. The costs are
largely governed by the staff: child ratios set out in the Children Act
Guidelines.
Full-time, live-out nanny, Pounds 150-Pounds 200 a week net. A parent paying
Pounds 180 a week net must also pay Pounds 95 tax, employee's NIC and
employer's NIC, making a total cost of Pounds 275 a week.
Hence the need for a national childcare strategy and a revisiting of the tax
relief debate.

<TEXT>
Sir, In his account of his recent visit to Belgium ('A king and his people:
Belgium's late monarch was a rare symbol of national identity', August 11)
Edward Mortimer gives ample space to the raving views of a Mr Sweron, an
obscure schoolmaster who belongs to the far-right political spectrum and
whose opinions do not in any way reflect those of the average Belgian
citizen.
Most Belgians reject separatism along ethnic or linguistic lines, a fact
proven by recent opinion polls. Their dignified sorrow following the death
of the king has demonstrated their profound allegiance to their country.
It is this and their faith in our new federalist state which keeps Belgium
alive, and not some obscure capitalistic conspiracy in Brussels as Mr Sweron
would have it.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Perils of being a good guy: Kohl's commitment to Europe is
not in doubt, but fears have arisen that German interests may come first
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl has liked to quote Sir Winston
Churchill to describe his vision of a 'United States of Europe'.
In recent months, he has stopped doing so.
'I no longer use that expression,' he says, 'because too many people
misunderstand it. They think we are trying to build a single country like
the United States of America.'
Now he stresses the need for every member state of the European Community to
maintain its own identity under a 'common European roof'.
The question arises: is he watering down the whole content of European
union, or simply changing the terminology? And is he talking about identity
alone, or is he beginning to talk about a revival of national interests?
The latest crisis in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System certainly raised fears in other parts of the EC (notably France) that
a unified Germany would put its own interests above its European
commitments. And when Mr Kohl declared in a television interview this week
that EC economic and monetary union might be delayed 'by a year or two',
Euro-sceptics across the Community began to chant: 'We told you so.'
In Germany the response has been one more of sorrow than of anger to the
charges. Few have questioned the wisdom or justice of the Bundesbank in
maintaining its firm path of slow but steady interest rate reductions -
refusing to respond to the massive currency speculation. The man in the
street is content that his D-Mark remains strong, even if German exporters
are worried at the effects of revaluation on their competitiveness.
'The more or less explicit accusation is that Germany has put its national
interest before that of Europe,' according to Mr Rainer Nahrendorf, joint
editor of Handelsblatt, the business newspaper. 'That is a hard charge for
Germans to accept. They have always seen European union as the flip-side of
German unification.'
In spite of its huge net budget contributions to the EC, Germany has
received little back to help it with the costs of unification, he says. On
top of that, the Bundesbank paid out billions of D-Marks to support the
French franc in the latest currency crisis.
'That is why statements which suggest that Germany sought to destroy the EMS
are quite absurd.'
Nobody in Germany doubts that Mr Kohl himself remains passionately committed
to European integration - to a federal Europe in the decentralised, German
sense. A recent poll of top business managers and civil servants agreed that
his European ambitions were his highest priority - even above winning the
next elections in 1994, or successfully completing the unification of
Germany.
It is the presentation therefore, not the substance, which has been adapted
to a changing political reality. For Mr Kohl now knows that the events of
the past few years, with the end of the cold war, the fall of the Berlin
Wall and German unification, and the signing of the Maastricht treaty with
its commitment to a single European currency, have raised new doubts about
European union.
In Germany, a complex range of issues has coincided to complicate the
European equation, and call into question old certainties.
The popular doubts about Maastricht concern, above all, the creation of a
single European currency to replace the D-Mark. They also relate to new
priorities in the post-cold war world: to the economic challenge of
realising German unification without bankrupting western Germany, and the
strategic challenge of stabilising the upheaval in eastern Europe.
'The whole debate on Maastricht coincided with the fear that 'they want to
take our D-Mark away,' ' says Dr Angelika Volle, editor of the foreign
affairs magazine Europa Archiv. 'The D-Mark was the foremost link of German
unity: it was what the east Germans wanted, and what we gave them. The
suggestion that now it will be somehow watered down by the Greeks or the
Italians is met with a simple: no way.
'Immediately afterwards came the conflict within the EC over Yugoslavia:
suddenly we discovered that the others thought differently to ourselves.
'For years we believed that what was good for Europe was good for Germany.
That is no longer seen as necessarily true,' said Angelika Volle.
Hard on the heels of those inner-German doubts came the furious debates in
other member states of the EC. In France, Denmark and Britain, the 'German
bogey' became a big issue in the arguments for and against the Maastricht
treaty.
At the heart of the Danish doubts over Maastricht was a fear that Denmark
might be reduced to the status of 'another German land'. In France, the
anti-Maastricht campaigners feared German domination, and the pro-Maastricht
campaigners also used that fear to argue for the treaty to 'bind Germany
in'. Nobody argued that Germany was nice. As for Britain, anti-German
xenophobia was obvious in the highest levels of the Thatcher government
(spelled out in public by the late Lord Ridley, although it cost him his
job), and fuelled the whole anti-Maastricht debate.
'It all came together with Germany having its own identity crisis,' says Ms
Volle. 'It is no longer just western Europe that is our fate, but eastern
Europe too. We do know more about what is going on there, and we are more
concerned than our west European partners.'
Again and again, Germany urged its partners to get more involved in the
east, with aid and trade and technical assistance. 'They simply cannot see
the dangers as dramatically as we do,' according to a senior German
diplomat. 'They are not sitting on top of the cooker.'
German officials maintain that it is not they who are putting national
interests first. It is their partners, like Britain and France. They see a
revival of old balance-of-power calculations in the machinations of London
and Paris in the Balkans, where they are both tempted to back Serbia, to
counteract Bonn's sympathy for Croatia.
The economic recession does not help. 'At the moment it is the time of
national interests, because it is a time of recession,' says Ms Volle. 'The
Germans are behaving a bit like Mrs Thatcher with her handbag. We say we
have got a very good record on Europe. Now we really have a German interest:
to try and weld the two Germanys together. That is our top priority.'
The process of defining Germany's national interests is clearly beginning.
Professor Karl-Heinz Hornhues, deputy leader of the Christian Democratic
Union in the Bundestag, announced last weekend a meeting of the
parliamentary leadership, scheduled for the near future in Berlin, to
redefine the party's foreign policy.
'National interests must be more clearly articulated in government policy,'
he said. 'We must state more clearly what we aim at. Up to now, Germany has
always formulated its interests quietly and cautiously. Now it is time to
speak frankly about our foreign policy aims.'
It is not necessarily an easy process. At a recent meeting in the
chancellor's office, some of Germany's top foreign policy analysts were
asked to define what they understood by 'national interests'. One confessed:
'We have never asked ourselves that question before.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has launched his own exercise to
sharpen the focus of foreign policy. The foreign policy institutes have been
invited to a meeting in Bonn in September, to be followed by a top-level
forum of his own Free Democrats. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign
Secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, have agreed to
attend.
Although the exercise is under way to define national interests, no one
seriously doubts that a commitment to closer European integration, based on
the European Community, will remain at their heart.
Europe will be a central element in the chancellor's election campaign next
year,' according to one close observer. 'The theme has to be: 'Look what the
EC has brought us. Peace and stability. Now we have to move on from here,
and monetary union is an essential part of it.'
'It is imperative for the chancellor that the process does not lose impetus.
An outbreak of triumphalism by the anti-Maastricht faction would severely
damage his credibility.'
Some observers believe Mr Kohl must be leaving himself open to an overtly
nationalist campaign by the opposition Social Democrats - at least on
economic policy. Yet, so far, there is no sign of it. Mr Rudolf Scharping,
the new SPD leader, is a supporter of the Maastricht treaty.
I am very much in favour of the Maastricht treaty being carried out,' he
says. But he does openly question the timescale. 'No one in Europe should be
the slave of a fixed timetable,' he says.
Mr Edmund Stoiber, the new prime minister of Bavaria, a leading member of
the Christian Social Union in the ruling coalition, and one of the most
articulate conservative politicians in Germany, is also a clear supporter of
the direction of European integration.
'We no longer want Germany to be the odd one out in Europe,' he says. 'I do
not want nationalism to raise its head again. If I ask my daughters: 'Could
we have a war with England?', they laugh, and say: 'Don't be silly, daddy.'
Seventy years ago it looked quite different. That is a fantastic
achievement.'
Yet Mr Stoiber doubts the Maastricht timetable, too. 'We have a huge road to
travel to reach monetary union. We have much more to do than the creators of
Maastricht believe . . . I do not believe that monetary union will happen
this century.'
When Mr Kohl questioned the Maastricht timetable this week, he was - say his
officials - only doubting that a single currency would happen by 1997: he
still maintains it will come about by 1999. 'Nobody will shed any tears if
it does not happen in '97,' an official admitted.
So Mr Kohl stands firm on his course. Yet some foreign observers are
worried. 'My greatest concern is if Britain and France continue to doubt the
hand of European friendship which the chancellor is offering,' says one
diplomat in Bonn. 'Eventually the Germans will get fed up trying to be the
good guys.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Men in the News:'Brat pack' at the Bank - Ian Plenderleith
and John Townend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
God and Demi-God is how one mischievous City economist refers to Ian
Plenderleith and his sidekick, John Townend, the men in charge of the Bank
of England's gilt-edged operations and the most powerful figures in the UK
government bond market.
Both have good reason to feel pleased. The Bank is well ahead of schedule in
issuing gilts to finance the government's hefty borrowing requirement
programme for this financial year, confounding those sceptics who thought
the task almost impossible because of the huge amount of stock the market
would have to digest.
But, in the words of one City analyst, gilts have been 'selling like hot
cakes' - just four and a half months into the financial year the Bank has
covered nearly 60 per cent of this year's likely Pounds 50bn gap between
government spending and revenues. The Bank has sold more than Pounds 1.5bn
of government bonds to investors such as UK pension funds this week alone.
While falling European interest rates and the lowest retail-price inflation
in the UK for nearly 30 years have helped boost demand for gilts,
Plenderleith and Townend have won plaudits from some in the City for their
management of the record volume of gilt issues - though a few economists
contend they have been selling the stock too cheaply.
They have particularly close contacts with the 19 City groups which are
registered gilt marketmakers acting as intermediaries between the Bank and
investors. One broker says of the duo: 'They are very thorough, they cover
all angles in incredible detail.' Another says they are 'good listeners'.
Plenderleith and Townend work a few feet from each other in cramped
adjoining offices filled with computer screens overlooking the Bank's inner
courtyard.
Plenderleith is the Bank's associate director in charge of markets, and
Townend is head of its gilt-edged and money-market divisions. Aged 49 and
45, they joined the Bank within three years of each other in the 1960s and
have worked together in markets jobs since 1985. Brought up in Birmingham
and Liverpool, respectively, they were both educated at grammar schools.
A significant element behind the rise of the duo has been the plain-speaking
Eddie George, promoted to Bank governor on July 1 from deputy governor.
George, the son of a postman in south London, has been at the Bank for 31
years and has retained a close influence over both Plenderleith and Townend.
Both are members of the so-called 'Eddie brat pack', the youngish,
down-to-earth Bank employees whom George supervised during his time in the
Bank's market divisions in the 1980s. The governor is thought likely to
promote Plenderleith to one of the four executive-director posts at the Bank
when the position becomes vacant next February.
Like George, both Plenderleith and Townend were born under the star sign of
Virgo and exhibit the common characteristics of lack of garrulousness and
addiction to hard work. According to US astrologer Linda Goodman, Virgos
have perfectionist, 'tick-tock' minds and worry a lot. The description
applies equally to both Plenderleith and Townend, whose jobs involve long
periods of monitoring computer screens so they can pick the best market
conditions to issue new types of government stock.
Their working day starts with a meeting to assess market conditions at
8.30am in Plenderleith's room, which has old banknotes and bond issues
framed on its wall. Plenderleith often discusses trading conditions via a
special hot line to the Treasury, with which the Bank collaborates over gilt
issues. 'He's an utter professional and has a poker player's fascination
with trying to spot market trends before they become apparent to others,'
says one former senior Bank employee. One broker says of Plenderleith: 'He
regards the gilts market as his baby - he wants it to be the best.'
Plenderleith - like George, a heavy smoker - rebuts suggestions that other
European government bond markets could offer any significant lessons to the
Bank. The senior of the two Bank men gives the impression of deliberating
before answering questions from outsiders.
The less cerebral Townend, a marathon runner, is more likely to give a
spontaneous reply in conversation. Someone who has known them both for more
than 20 years says: 'Ian speaks in paragraphs and gives it you straight.
John talks in sentences and makes things more exciting.'
Plenderleith is credited with making serious attempts to make gilts more
attractive by, for instance, issuing longer-dated stock to meet the needs of
pensions funds and insurance companies. But some critics believe the Bank
has taken too long to adapt settlement procedures making it more convenient
for international investors to trade gilts. Another suggestion is that the
Bank should issue more low-yielding, shorter-dated stock rather than
higher-yielding, longer-dated gilts, to reduce the size of the debt burden
for future generations.
'It's a minor financial scandal that the Bank is issuing stock that will
require very high interest payments in the future when inflation is expected
to stay low,' says Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank.
Plenderleith and Townend like to give the impression of viewing suggested
improvements to the market seriously. But the Bank's cautious and unassuming
deities both clearly feel that evolution should proceed at a relatively
stately pace, whereas others feel the tempo could be quicker.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Provoking the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE WORLD stock markets lost touch with economic reality? In the UK this
week the FT-SE 100 index broke through the 3,000 barrier just as a whole
series of economic statistics and company results cast serious doubt on the
strength of the recovery. In continental Europe, equity markets soared
despite the continuing contraction in industrial output. Wall Street has
looked overvalued for so long that it is hard to remember when, if at all,
it was last remotely near to being in touch. At times like this, the
apologists tend to argue that the markets are a barometer that reflects
expectations about the future, while the cynics claim that the markets are
driven by money, not economic fundamentals. The cynics are probably nearer
the mark.
There is nothing new, in the UK, about a market that breaks through ceilings
when the real economy is looking sickly. Liquidity abounds in recessions and
invariably fuels a rise in the markets. That said, other economic forces are
at play in the sense that the present surge in European markets has largely
been prompted by expectations of falling interest rates. Where the barometer
analogy breaks down is in the way that markets themselves influence economic
activity. By creating a wealth effect, a rising market affects spending
within the economy. The locus classicus of the broken barometer theory is
Japan, where the whole economy overheated, then crashed, on the back of the
stock market bubble of the late 1980s.
Ideological attack
At a time when markets are under ideological attack, notably from
politicians in the countries that formed the former hard core of the
European exchange rate mechanism, it does no harm to point out that buoyant
securities markets have been exceptionally accommodating of late to
businessmen and governments alike. In the UK, industrial and commercial
companies took advantage of an increasingly giddy market to raise more than
Pounds 8bn of fresh equity in the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds
5.3bn for the whole of 1992. The Bank of England, meantime, has already sold
enough gilts to cover nearly 60 per cent of its Pounds 50bn borrowing
requirement for 1993-94 in the first four and a half months of the financial
year.
As for the French government, a soaring equity market is likely to make
light work of a heavy privatisation programme. The Italians have been
fortunate in being given the benefit of the doubt by international bond
investors despite a bloated stock of public sector debt and a poor record on
inflation. Governments generally have seen the risk premium in their IOUs
tending to narrow as investors' inflationary expectations have subsided.
The risk in the present high level of share prices is less that equity
markets will succumb to an autonomous free fall than that governments will
provoke a collapse by confounding market expectations about interest rates.
It is not difficult to see how this might come about in Europe, where
politicians' understanding of markets is woefully deficient.
Classic case
In the aftermath of the ERM fiasco, for example, the French prime minister,
Mr Edouard Balladur, has chosen to ignore the message implicit in the
near-collapse of the ERM and is calling for reforms to curb the activities
of the speculators. Even if it were possible to reintroduce some workable
form of exchange control, which seems unlikely, this would still be a
classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted. For a
consequence of the widening of the ERM bands is that the ability of markets
to wield discipline over governments has shifted from the currency markets
to the securities markets. Since exchange rate relationships are no longer
fixed within the ERM, they are invulnerable to attack. But if interest rate
policy is inflexible, investors can cause a securities market collapse by
bolting for the exit.
In an inflationary environment, such market discipline is exercised through
the government bond market, leaving the politicians with an unpalatable
choice between cutting expenditure or raising taxes. In a deflationary
environment of the kind that prevails in continental Europe, the discipline
is felt in equities. A falling stock market causes a negative wealth effect,
as savers respond to their loss of capital by spending more cautiously and
investing in cash. Companies suffer from a higher cost of capital. This adds
to the deflationary pressure within the economy.
By failing to make use of the opportunity to cut interest rates sharply now
that the opportunity is available, the ERM members whose economies are
shrinking and whose unemployment rates are rising are courting trouble in
the equity market. Elsewhere, notably in the United States, the risk is more
that a favourable downward trend in interest rates has simply come to an
end. The message for investors is to watch for nervousness over lack of
action on interest rates in Europe and for an active change of policy by the
Fed in the US. Equities are in dangerous territory.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Hopes high for end to mail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PEACE formula to resolve the 12-day Royal Mail dispute in Cardiff will be
put to a ballot of the 900 postal workers tomorrow by the Union of
Communication Workers.
Hopes of a settlement are high after the UCW's national executive agreed
late on Thursday night to recommend a return to work on the basis of a
framework agreement negotiated between national union officials and the
Royal Mail. Details of the proposed deal have not been disclosed.
The UCW said the union's Cardiff branch will meet this morning when national
and local officials will address the staff on the contents of the framework
agreement. This will be followed by an individual membership ballot
tomorrow.
The UCW said strikers were 'strongly advised' to attend the meeting and
ballot wearing uniforms because the premises of the Cardiff post office
would be protected by security and only postal staff and union officials
would be allowed in.
The Cardiff strike has paralysed delivery of well over 1m letters and has
led to severe difficulties for companies in south Wales.
The point at issue has been the introduction of fixed shift patterns for the
workers to replace the old roster system, a change that has taken place over
a large part of the Royal Mail already.
It has taken more than a week of negotiations to establish a formula for a
return to work, and the careful way in which union officials are handling
the dispute suggests they are aware of possible difficulties with the local
branch.
Yesterday Companies House, the government's corporate information agency in
Cardiff, stepped up its efforts to negate the strike's effects.
The agency has launched a national press advertising campaign and is
considering radio announcements next week to persuade companies to send
annual accounts and returns to its offices elsewhere in the country if the
strike continues.
It estimates that the strike has already cost it about Pounds 250,000 and
that it will be forced to pay substantial additional overtime to staff
processing the backlog.
The volume of company returns received fell to as low as 30 per cent of the
normal level as a result of the strike, although it has now recovered
slightly as companies have begun using alternative methods of delivery.
If the strike continues much later into this month, thousands of companies
may face the prospect of late-filing penalties on their annual accounts
which have been held up in the post.
Companies House is advising businesses to use hand deliveries, the DX
document transfer system or to send returns to its offices in cities other
than Cardiff. It has received several thousand calls from businesses to
special inquiry lines opened two weeks ago.
The agency said it would treat 'sympathetically' any company returns that
have been delayed in the post. 'This strike is costing Cardiff business a
lot of money and disruption,' it said.
Outgoing post has been less affected because the agency has been able to use
private courier services and other agencies to avoid the local postal
system.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Labour takes London borough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR TOOK control of the west London borough of Hillingdon yesterday after
winning a by-election.
The seat gave the party 35 councillors to the Conservatives' 34. No other
parties are represented on the council.
Hillingdon was last controlled by Labour in 1978, and had a hung council
between 1986 and 1990.
Mr Steve Panayi, the borough's Labour leader, said the result demonstrated
that 'not only the Liberal Democrats can win by-elections in the south'.
He said Labour intended to spend reserves to reinstate a range of social
services that were cut by the Conservatives earlier this year.
Hillingdon's shift reflects the growing strength in local government of both
Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
These parties have shared control in a number of county councils since the
elections in May, despite Labour's opposition to deals with the Liberal
Democrats at national level.
In Bedfordshire and Wiltshire, however, Labour shares power with the
Conservatives, while in Cheshire and Surrey the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats hold power.
Labour denies that these deals have involved bargaining over policies.
Labour said: 'The essential point is that Labour must maintain a separate
political identity. That's the overriding criterion the national executive
committee has used. Clearly on a day-to-day basis there will inevitably be
some co-operation.'
Local Labour parties have been asked to explain their power-sharing
arrangements to Labour's national executive committee, which has given
approval to most of the deals for a year.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Revenue contests BES tax relief ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue is appealing against a High Court judgment that
overturned its decision to deny tax relief to two Pounds 25m business
expansion schemes.
The schemes were issued by National Westminster Bank in conjunction with
Hambros Bank and BZW, the securities arm of Barclays Bank.
The High Court agreed with the banks last month that their loan-back BES
schemes were eligible for tax relief. BES schemes give tax relief to
investors at their highest marginal rate if they hold their investment for
five years.
In his March Budget Mr Norman Lamont, who was then chancellor, abolished
loan-back BES schemes, which allowed investors to withdraw after six months
instead of five years. He ruled that shares in BES companies had to be
issued by the midnight before the Budget if loans were to be made against
them.
The banks had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the
companies' register of members by the Budget deadline.
In May the Revenue decided that the shares had not been 'issued' and would
not be eligible for tax relief.
But the High Court ruled that the word 'issue' had no fixed meaning and
there was no reason to think that the availability of BES tax relief was
dependent on actual registration of shareholders.
The Revenue said yesterday that it opposed the judgment because it blurred
'the distinction between the issue and allotment of shares, and this could
impinge on other areas of tax legislation'.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Europe's time may finally have arrived: An attempt to shift
Britain further away from GMT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a quarter of a century after public opinion forced parliament to
abandon an experimental period of permanent summer time, the government is
on the verge of trying again.
There now seems little likelihood that opponents will be able to mobilise
the sort of public backlash which frightened MPs into submission in 1970 -
just two years into a three-year experiment.
Opinion polls carried out this year by Gallup for the pressure group
Daylight Extra Action suggest that Mr John Major's accident-prone government
may finally have hit on a policy which commands widespread public support.
The catalyst for change is the European Commission, which is expected to
produce a draft directive next month calling for the harmonisation of EC
countries' annual time changes. The commission wants Britain and the Irish
Republic, which move from summer to winter time in October, to come into
line with the rest of the Community, which changes in September.
That would put an end to the awkward autumn period when time in the British
Isles is briefly synchronised with the rest of Europe, only to move out of
line again a few weeks later.
However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, wants to go further. His
plan, which has Mr Major's support, is to move Britain an hour ahead of
Greenwich mean time in the winter, and two hours in the summer. That would
put Britain on central European time, along with all other Community nations
except Greece. The Republic of Ireland would face the awkward choice of
going along with Britain or remaining the sole member of Europe's GMT zone.
Most of the pressure for change has been applied by the Confederation of
British Industry, which argues that industry is unnecessarily hampered by
the existing time difference.
Ministers have also been influenced by a campaign run by Mr Angus
Crichton-Miller, the London businessman who chairs Daylight Extra. He argues
that an extra hour of evening daylight would be popular with millions of
people who would no longer have to travel home from work in the dark in
winter.
The crucial argument, however, is provided by recent research by the
government's Transport and Road Research Laboratory into the 1968-70
experiment which suggests that a time switch would reduce road accident
deaths by 160 a year and serious injuries by more than 2,000.
Until recently ministers believed that any proposal to move on to European
time would be torpedoed by the groups which proved so powerful in 1970.
The key opponents were farmers and construction companies, which claimed
that the extra hour of morning darkness made winter working more difficult
and dangerous. The experiment was also unpopular in Scotland, where dawn
arrives later than in England. However, the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales says that it now accepts the road safety argument and is
willing to accept change as long as farmers are given time to adjust.
Even in Scotland opinion is less hostile than it used to be, partly because
the accident forecasts suggest that Scotland would benefit from one of the
largest falls in road casualties.
So far the only implacable opposition seems to be coming from the scientific
community.
Ms Kristen Lippincott, curator of astronomy at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich, historic home of GMT, argues that a switch would in effect
mean abandoning GMT after more than 100 years as the anchor of the world's
time system.

FT  14 AUG 93 / NatWest sets out on a mission to explain: The bank's aim of
removing risk on mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER'S warning to 12,000 customers that it is considering
securitising their mortgages is likely to provoke some perplexity. One
reason why this funding method has not spread as fast in the UK as in the US
has been the difficulty of explaining it to investors, let alone borrowers.
Banks, however, have an increasing incentive to make their intention clear.
Mortgages have emerged as the single part of their UK loan portfolios which
has expanded rapidly this year, so they have come under more pressure to
ensure that it does not absorb too much capital.
Lenders securitise their assets in the UK by establishing a company to hold
mortgages. The company raises the money to pay the bank by issuing debt
securities to investors on which the interest payments are funded by
mortgage repayments. The investors take the risk of default on the
repayments.
This has two advantages for banks. First, it removes the default risk from
balance sheets. Although NatWest will retain control of setting interest
rates, it passes on risk. But more importantly, securitisation takes the
asset itself off the balance sheet and does not absorb bank capital.
NatWest emphasised yesterday that it did not need to free capital. Banks'
ability to expand loans if there were a sharp economic recovery, however,
could be constrained. Their ratio of core capital to assets weighted by risk
is in several cases below a 'well-capitalised bank' in the US definition.
Securitisation of mortgages - or other assets such as the payments due on
credit cards which have been securitised in the US - also means banks can
work their capital harder. They can raise the return on equity on which
investors rate them by swapping interest payments for a capital payment.
Although Barclays Bank has ventured into mortgage securitisation - issuing
Pounds 175m of mortgage-backed securities in 1989 through a vehicle company
called Gracechurch Mortgage Finance - NatWest's move signals renewed
interest. Barclays is already working on further mortgage securitisation in
the US.
For customers it is a rather more imponderable business. Mr Richard Ferrett,
head of asset management at NatWest, yesterday insisted that it would make
no difference. The process would be invisible to the borrower.
'We are going to adhere to whatever customer reaction we get and respect
their wishes,' he said. It seems likely though that opposition will stem
from incomprehension rather than an obvious objection to the practice. Yet
the process raises a number of questions for borrowers.
One is whether banks' general attitudes to mortgage default will be
affected. Investors will be less keen to invest in securities where there
appears to be a risk of repayments being interrupted.
Banks cannot allow default among borrowers, and then ensure that interest
payments on the securities are maintained by paying them separately. To
qualify under regulatory rules to be removed from balance sheets, the risks
of securities have to pass from the bank to the investor.
In practice, banks try to ensure a steady flow of interest payments by
'self-insuring' the issues. This means packaging enough mortgages together
to allow some defaults without affecting the payments. But widespread use of
securitisation could gradually change bank attitudes towards default.
A second issue for borrowers is whether banks are likely to tilt borrowing
towards types of mortgages that can easily be securitised. This could mean
mortgages outside areas with high rates of default, thereby increasing
conservatism among mortgage lenders.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPETITIVENESS of UK industry continued to improve in June, official
figures revealed yesterday.
Manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 3 per cent lower in
the three months to June than in the same period a year before. This figure
compares with a fall of 3.4 per cent in the three months to May.
Manufacturing productivity - output per head - was 1.3 per cent higher in
the second quarter compared with the first and 8.2 per cent higher than in
the same three months a year earlier.
The year-on-year increase in productivity was the second highest since
December 1986. The highest since then was in the three months ending May,
when productivity grew by 8.5 per cent.
Output per head in the whole economy was 0.8 per cent higher in the first
quarter of this year than in the previous three-month period and 4 per cent
higher than in the same quarter a year ago.
The latest figures suggest UK industry is competing effectively abroad.
The 3 per cent drop in unit wage costs in the first quarter compares with
growth of 9 per cent in Germany, 7 per cent in Japan and minus 1 per cent in
the US during the same quarter.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Printers claim a pay-rise success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE majority of Britain's print workers have secured union demands of basic
pay rises of 3.78 per cent and an extra day's holiday, Mr Tony Dubbins,
general secretary of the GPMU printing union, said yesterday.
He said that 85 per cent of his members had won increases of Pounds 6.50 a
week through company-level bargaining after the breakdown of the national
agreement earlier in the year.
He accused the employers' body, the British Printing Industries Federation,
of misleading its affiliated company members over the level of wage deals
secured in the industry. He added that the union was going back to companies
that had not reached agreement on its terms to secure higher rises.
Mr Dubbins challenged the federation to make public all pay data from
affiliated companies.
'We are willing to make all of our information publicly available if the
federation will do the same,' he said.
Mr Andrew Brown, personnel director at the federation, said it would not be
revealing its data.
The federation insists that nearly two thirds of the 1,060 member companies
that have reported details of their settlements - half of the federation's
members - have made deals at less than the union demand.
Mr Brown pointed out that the federation listed the companies that had
settled and not the number of workers covered by the deals. This suggests
that both sides may be right because they are using different, but
complementary, figures.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Peerage goes to former Sogat chief Brenda Dean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced the creation of eight 'working' peers to
strengthen the three main parties in the House of Lords.
The most prominent are Ms Brenda Dean, who was the first woman to lead a big
trade union, and Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National and a
former European commissioner.
Working peers are created by the Queen on the recommendation of party
leaders, usually during the summer parliamentary recess. They are expected
to play a full part in the chamber's main role of reviewing legislation.
The list of four Conservatives, three Labour and one Liberal Democrat is
significantly smaller than last year's crop of 21, prompting Labour
complaints that its party's numbers are not being fully replenished. Nine
Labour peers have died since last summer including Lord Underhill, a former
general secretary of the party.
The latest list is more balanced than last year's, which added 13
Conservative peers compared with six Labour, one Liberal Democrat and one
independent.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has restricted himself to four
Conservative nominations, confirming the government's overall satisfaction
with the performance of its Lords team.
The four, all experienced politicians, are: Sir Paul Dean, a former deputy
speaker of the Commons; Mrs Doreen Miller, chairman of the Conservative
party's Greater London organisation; Mr Robert Dixon Smith, a former
chairman of the Association of County Councils; and Sir Christopher, a
former chairman of the European Commission and also once a Financial Times
leader writer.
Ms Dean, who was successively general secretary of the print union Sogat and
deputy leader of its successor, the GPMU print union, is expected to play a
prominent part in Labour's smaller Lords team.
She was already being talked of yesterday as a potential member of the front
bench, along with Mr Simon Haskel, the second Labour nomination.
Mr Haskel, chairman of Perrotts, a Leeds-based packing and textile company,
is an adviser on industrial policy who was in the Downing Street policy unit
which advised Lord Callaghan when he was prime minister in the 1970s.
He said that he intended to delegate most of his management responsibilities
to colleagues in order to work 'virtually full-time' in the Lords.
The third Labour peer is Ms Joyce Gould, a former director of the party's
national organisation. The Liberal Democrat peer will be Mr Anthony Lester,
a founder member of the Social Democratic party and a leading constitutional
lawyer.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Printers say they have won 3.8% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE majority of Britain's print workers have secured union demands of basic
pay rises of 3.78 per cent and an extra day's holiday, Mr Tony Dubbins,
general secretary of the GPMU print union, said yesterday.
He said 85 per cent of his members had won increases of Pounds 6.50 a week
through company-level bargaining after the breakdown of the national
agreement earlier in the year.
He accused the employers' body, the British Printing Industries Federation,
of misleading its affiliated company members over the level of wage deals
secured in the industry.
Mr Dubbins challenged the federation to make public all pay data from
affiliated companies.
'We are willing to make all of our information publicly available if the
federation will do the same,' he said.
Mr Andrew Brown, personnel director at the federation, said it would not
reveal its data. The federation insists that nearly two thirds of the 1,060
member companies which have reported details of their settlements - half of
the federation's members - have made deals at less than the union demand.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Airlines agree Heathrow deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH MIDLAND and American Airlines are joining forces in the battle for
more passengers by introducing 'code-sharing' on the UK carrier's services
from Heathrow to Brussels, Amsterdam and Glasgow.
The agreement, announced last night, is an important move for both airlines
and is aimed at attracting passengers who might otherwise have travelled on
British Airways.
BA is a leading rival of American on transatlantic routes and of British
Midland on routes between the UK and continental Europe.
Code-sharing has become increasingly common in the airline business over the
past year. US carriers are not allowed to fly passengers into London and
then on to other European destinations, but listing a European airline's
connecting flights under a common code or number makes passengers more
confident about making connections.
Under yesterday's agreement, American will use its 'AA' designator code on
certain British Midland flights from Heathrow as a continuation of its own
flights from six US cities - Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago
and Los Angeles.
Mr Austin Reed, British Midland's managing director, said: 'Developing
closer links with long-haul airlines is one element in our strategy to
develop more business worldwide. As the second-largest user at Heathrow, we
are ideally placed to transport worldwide inbound traffic to the major
cities of Europe.'
British Midland has a similar code-sharing agreement with United Airlines,
which has worked successfully for the past year. United had no comment
yesterday, but British Midland said the two arrangements would work side by
side.
Earlier this year big US airlines complained that they were put at a
competitive disadvantage when the US government let BA enter into a
code-sharing agreement with USAir.
British Midland has filed an authorisation request with the US Department of
Transport for the code-sharing deal.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Rover plans big expansion in making engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the UK carmaker, is planning an ambitious expansion of its engine
programme during the mid 1990s including the production of a new
top-of-the-range V6 engine.
The new engines, which will also feature the introduction of a 1.6 litre
version of its successful 1.1 litre and 1.4 litre K Series engines, will
allow Rover to reduce significantly its dependence on Honda, the Japanese
carmaker.
Rover is developing the V6 engine from its present K Series family of power
units and is expected to launch the new engine in its 800 series executive
car range in 1995.
It would replace the present 2.7 litre V6 Honda engine, which the Japanese
carmaker now makes only for Rover, and would represent a considerable
cost-saving for Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace.
The K Series engine, launched in 1989, is now made in four-cylinder 1.1
litre and 1.4 litre versions to power the Rover Metro and some versions of
the Rover 200/400 series cars, while the UK carmaker also buys a more
powerful 1.6 litre engine from Honda for the Rover 200/400.
The new 1.6 litre engine for the K Series will be introduced next year in
the Rover 200 to replace the Honda power unit produced at the Japanese
carmaker's plant in Swindon.
Rover's engine production is based at its Longbridge, Birmingham plant.
At present Rover buys all of its 2.0 litre and 2.3 litre engines for the
Rover 600 from Honda.
The Japanese carmaker holds a 20 per cent equity stake in Rover vehicle
operations, and the Rover 200/400, 600 and 800 series are based on Honda
technology.
Rover has entered discussions with Kia Motors, the South Korean carmaker,
which is considering producing a version of the Rover V6 engine in Korea to
power an executive car it is developing for launch in the second half of the
1990s.
Kia is also discussing the engine project with other carmakers in Japan and
Europe.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Early new-car registrations jump 11.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGISTRATIONS of new cars in the first 10 days of August jumped by 11.6 per
cent to 249,153 from 223,283 in the same period last year.
The beginning of August is the busiest period of the year for the retail
motor industry and a key test of the state of new-car demand.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday that forecasts
for a year-on-year increase in sales for the whole of August to 'at least
400,000' from 374,000 were 'realistic'.
Vauxhall, the second-placed carmaker in the UK market, said that it expected
an 11 per cent increase in total August sales to 415,000. Ford, the market
leader, was less optimistic and forecast sales of between 400,000 and
405,000.
Mr Geoffrey Pelling, SMMT deputy chief executive, said the 11.6 per cent
rise in the first 10 days 'clearly indicates that market recovery is
continuing'.
New-car sales have been higher year-on-year in 13 of the past 16 months, and
registrations in the first seven months of the year rose by 9.1 per cent to
874,411.
The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where sales are
growing, albeit from a very depressed level.
Sales in the first 10 days of August were well below the record level of
307,237 achieved in the same period in 1989, which showed 'how severely UK
sales have suffered since then', said Mr Pelling.
'It would be dangerous to assume that car manufacturers in the UK will
remain impervious to the effects of the Continental recession,' he added.
Vauxhall announced last week that it would have to continue short-time
working at its Luton and Ellesmere Port plants during August.
During the first 10 days of August, which account for about 60 per cent of
the sales for the full month, the biggest gains were achieved by Renault and
Citroen, the French carmakers, and by Vauxhall.
Renault and Citroen increased their sales volumes by more than a third,
while Vauxhall increased its sales by 19 per cent to capture 16.8 per cent
of the market compared with 15.7 per cent a year ago.
Ford suffered a further erosion of its market share which fell to 21.3 per
cent from 22.7 per cent a year ago as strong sales of its Mondeo were offset
by falling demand for its Escort and Fiesta ranges. Volkswagen is also
suffering from falling sales and was forced to take action this week to
lower its list prices to stem the decline.
Ford's share has been steadily eroded in recent years, falling from 28.8 per
cent in 1987 to 22.2 per cent last year, its lowest share since 1975. By
contrast Vauxhall's share has risen from 13.5 per cent in 1987 to a record
16.7 per cent last year. In the first seven months of the year Ford gained
21.7 per cent of the new-car market compared with the 17.3 per cent held by
Vauxhall.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Unions urge motorists to spurn Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS will be urged next week to boycott Shell petrol stations at the
beginning of a campaign by oil industry workers against alleged
union-busting.
Oil industry unions have been heavily influenced by organised labour in the
US and plan to use alternative tactics to the more traditional strikes,
overtime bans and working to rule. The campaign will be launched on
Wednesday to mobilise public sympathy against the oil companies, which the
unions accuse of colluding to derecognise trade unionism.
The initial focus will be Shell UK, which recently decided to withdraw, from
September 3, union recognition from 360 process and craft workers at its
Shell Haven refinery in Essex.
Off-duty oil workers and others are to leaflet Shell petrol stations urging
customers to boycott the company's products. Leaflets have already been
distributed at Shell filling stations in Essex around the company's Haven
refinery.
'Unions will never abandon their traditional use of the strike weapon as a
last resort but we believe alternative forms of action exist that we can use
to achieve our aims,' said Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU general union national
official for the oil industry.
'We plan to apply pressure on Shell without resorting to a stoppage.
Striking would play into the hands of the company which would then dismiss
workers and avoid paying them redundancy,' he said.
During the past two years there has been widespread union derecognition by
other oil companies - most notably BP, Esso and Mobil.
The five main unions in the industry - the TGWU, AEEU engineering and
electrical union, MSF white-collar union, GMB general union and Ucatt
construction union - believe there is a concerted attack.
'We are drawing the line at Shell,' said Mr Higgs. 'We have been forced to
act.'
Mr Higgs believes the new tactics could also be used by unions outside the
oil industry as an alternative to strikes.
The unions argue that the issue in the oil industry is about human rights,
not just an industrial grievance. 'There is no other country in western
Europe like Britain where employers can derecognise a trade union with
impunity,' said Mr Higgs.
'If we allow this strategy by the oil companies to succeed it will be the
beginning of the end for employee influence, decent wages and decent working
conditions in the industry.'
The TGWU is staging a conference on the issue on Wednesday. It will be
attended by representatives from Liberty, the civil rights organisation, and
the Brussels-based International Confederation of Chemical and Energy
Workers.
The unions have lobbied parliament, petitioned the European assembly in
Strasbourg, and secured 150 MPs' signatures to an early-day motion in the
Commons condemning the derecognition tactics of the oil companies.
Trade union organisations around the world have written to Shell to
complain.
Shell UK yesterday denied collusion with other oil companies in
derecognising unions. 'We make our decisions in the light of our own
business circumstances,' it said. It refused to comment on the planned
boycott.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Profits success turns sour for insurance companies: Richard
Lapper looks at accusations that the industry is making customers pay for
its mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's big insurance companies came under fire this week - not for losing
money as they have done during the past three years but for making profits
at the expense of their customers.
Three of the top five general insurance companies - General Accident,
Commercial Union and Royal Insurance - reported healthy profits for the
first six months of this year. The other two - Guardian Royal Exchange and
Sun Alliance - will follow suit during the next four weeks.
The profits represent a turnround for insurers that were hit by a
combination of storm damage, subsidence, recession-related arson, theft and
domestic losses between 1990 and 1992.
The slump in the housing market produced a deluge of claims on domestic
mortgage indemnity (DMI) policies. These insure building societies and
mortgage lenders against losses on the sale of repossessed properties.
The losses, unprecedented for most companies, prompted far-reaching
rationalisation and thousands of job losses.
Premiums have also been increased sharply. Royal Insurance, for example,
increased its average motor rates by 21.2 per cent in 1991, by 22.1 per cent
in 1992 and by 17.7 per cent this year. Royal's household policy owners
faced average increases of more than 20 per cent over the past 2 1/2 years.
More controversially, insurers have begun to change the way they price
insurance, charging higher premiums for worse risks. Some owners of houses
built on clay soils, which are prone to subsidence damage, have faced rises
of more than 100 per cent. Drivers of fast or fashionable cars, regarded as
targets for theft, have also paid higher premiums.
Critics suggest that it is the sheer scale of these increases which allowed
the companies to return to profit. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy
at the Consumers' Association, said consumers were 'footing the bill' for
the companies' mistakes in the 1980s.
'Rather than looking at product design or reviewing errors of corporate
judgment in the past, everything is loaded on to policyholders,' said Ms
Eaglesham.
She said errors had included the purchase of estate agencies and expansion
into the domestic mortgage indemnity market at a time when underwriters
assumed house prices could not fall.
The criticisms find an echo within the insurance industry. Mr Mark Wood,
managing director of Safeguard, one of the country's largest chains of
independent insurance brokers, said: 'Past losses are a result of past
pricing errors. There appears to be a complacent belief in some insurance
companies that their product is completely price elastic.
He added: 'Many of the big companies are returning to profit not by
increasing efficiency and productivity growth but simply by increasing their
prices.'
Mr Wood suggested that turbulence in pricing could be increasing
inefficiency.
He said frequent price rises were leading more people to shop around, with
the result that the industry was offering many price quotes that were not
accepted.
''Churning' is leading to falls in productivity. It is a self-inflicted
problem,' said Mr Wood, who estimates that the industry may be offering
quotes on four times as many policies as it sells each year.
The industry fiercely rejects such arguments.
Mr Roy Elms, underwriting director of Royal Insurance, said: 'In the context
of the UK market to suggest you can claw back DMI losses by increasing rates
on other lines is absurd. The market just will not allow it.'
Insurers also argue that UK consumers have historically enjoyed a good deal
from their insurers, with cover generally wider than that available in most
European countries.
Many European home insurance policies do not cover against the risks of
flood or subsidence, for example.
Insurers accept that they must avoid sharp rises in prices in the future.
Mr Elms, who took over responsibility for Royal's underwriting in 1991,
said: 'One of the mistakes insurers made in the past is that they did not
put prices up when there were clear indications that they should. The
sensible thing to do is adjust prices little and often.'
Insurers also argue that they have introduced much greater efficiency into
their operations, pointing to falls in their expenses ratios, the industry
yardstick which measures efficiency by comparing costs to premium income.
Critics suggest that the reforms have been very limited in character and
that relatively few companies have seriously tried to reorganise business
processes. 'They are nibbling around at the edges,' said Mr Wood.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Astra Training row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday claimed that the government secretly promised Pounds 4.8m
to prevent the troubled Astra Training Services company collapsing before
the last general election, Kevin Brown writes.
Astra's 35 training centres are in the hands of the receivers. The company,
formerly the Skills Training Agency, was privatised three years ago.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, released leaked government
briefing papers which he claimed proved that the Employment Department
agreed to underwrite 'unforeseen additional costs' incurred by Astra after
privatisation.
'They show that Michael Howard (then employment secretary) secretly bailed
out the company just before the general election,' he said.
The department said parliament had been told that Pounds 4.82m was made
available for Astra after privatisation, although only Pounds 1.3m had been
handed over.

<TEXT>
RECEIVERS have been called in at Kent-based Page Building &amp; Mechanical, a
medium-sized building company which does construction and technical work for
local authorities.
Bank of Scotland has appointed Mr Peter Lawrence and Mr Colin Wiseman of the
London insolvency practitioners Booth White as receivers for Page, which
owes subcontractors more than Pounds 600,000.
Page has said that its financial difficulties stemmed mainly from an
advertisement in the London Gazette last December by a creditor seeking a
winding-up order. Page is taking legal action against its former solicitors
over the matter. Mr Lawrence said yesterday that Page believed the
advertisement had destroyed its credibility.
Apart from the debts to subcontractors, Mr Lawrence said, there were also
counter-claims from Page's clients who terminated contracts and who face
costs for finding alternative contractors.
The receivers hope to 'novate' Page's contracts from Lambeth Council and
other clients. That could revive the contracts and allow subcontractors to
continue working.

LOCAL government employees working less than 15 hours a week are entitled to

This follows a campaign by the GMB general union which has argued that the

THE AMOUNT of bank debt in the property industry has fallen by 10.8 per cent
to Pounds 36.2bn from its peak of Pounds 40.6bn in May 1991, according to
the Bank of England, Vanessa Houlder writes.
Bank loans to the industry fell by Pounds 550m to Pounds 36.2bn in the
quarter to June 1993, the eighth consecutive quarter in which debt has
fallen.
The sharpest decline was registered by the US banks, which have cut their
exposure to UK property by 24 per cent over the past year to Pounds 1.26bn.
The UK banks, which have a 58 per cent share of the market, have reduced
their outstanding loans by 5 per cent over the past year. Japanese banks
have cut their exposure by 10 per cent over the year to Pounds 4.09bn.

<TEXT>
MR Diego Curto, one of the most senior judges on the company law bench at
Milan's court of justice, has been placed under investigation in Italy's
18-month political corruption scandal.
The move followed an inter-rogation on Thursday at which Mr Curto, who has
been practising law in Milan for the past 34 years, was questioned about his
role in the period before the demise of the Enimont chemicals concern.
Executives at Montedison, the industrial arm of the troubled Ferruzzi group,
allegedly paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) in kickbacks to politicians during
the lifetime of Enimont, the ill-fated chemicals joint venture between
Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group.
Because Mr Curto himself is a judge, the allegations against him of aiding
and abetting a crime will be investigated by magistrates in Brescia, which
is responsible for disciplinary matters in the Milan judicial district. He
yesterday protested his innocence.

THE inflation scare that alarmed the US Federal Reserve earlier this year
seems well and truly over. US consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent last month,
following increases of 0.1 per cent in May and zero in June, the Labour
Department reported yesterday.
The year-on-year rate of inflation dropped to 2.8 per cent last month. Since
May consumer prices have risen at an annualised rate of less than 1 per
cent, meeting the practical criterion of zero inflation. From January to
April consumer prices rose at an annualised rate of over 4 per cent.
Wholesale price inflation is equally subdued. Producer prices fell both last
month and in June and rose only 1.3 per cent in the year to July.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Tokyo's hotels adjust to the one-cent yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGNBOARD at the wood-panelled foreign exchange counter of Tokyo's
Imperial Hotel yesterday told the whole story. Those with dollars to sell
would get just Y99.75 per greenback. For the first time, the yen was worth
more than a US cent.
According to Mr Akihisa Inaba, a manager at the hotel: 'Many Americans came
to look, but when they saw the board they just shook their heads and said
'No, not today'.'
Whether next week will be any better remains to be resolved between the
country's new coalition government and the currency speculators who are
punting on wholesale rates for the dollar breaking Y100 and going even
lower.
Japanese officials are trying to talk down the yen as car makers and others
tremble at the impact of its appreciation on exports. But those feeling it
first are in the hotel lobbies.
As the Imperial's cashier gestured obligingly for photographers capturing
the unprecedented exchange rate on the board behind her, one American
businessman muttered while he checked out, counting out small change: 'I
don't know why I carried around all this stuff.'
Another visitor put him right on the value of the lightweight aluminium
coinage, which Japanese in an otherwise tip-free society happily discard
into jars beside cash registers in convenience stores. 'Listen, when I got
here last week I ignored it too. Now it stays in my purse because I know
it's worth something.'
American tourists have not been easily deterred by the strength of the yen
in recent years, and the number visiting the country as holidaymakers last
year grew by nearly 3 per cent to reach almost 300,000. Their habits are
becoming more frugal, however.
On their way to witness a tea ceremony at the Imperial, Mrs Rachelle Levy
and her son Frank from Des Moines, Iowa, sought refreshment at a pavement
vending machine which dispensed a can of Coke for a bearable Y110, rather
higher than the Midwest going rate, but about a fifth of Tokyo hotel prices.
'It contributes to an inferiority complex if you can't buy things as easily
as in your own country,' said Mr Levy. 'You feel a bit second-class.' The
only advantage, according to his mother, is that a rate of Y100 to the
dollar 'makes things easier to work out - we've been computing on that basis
anyway.'
The basis on which the Imperial Hotel computes has been thrown a bit by the
latest surge in the yen.
Just under 10 per cent of its guests are Americans, most of whom are on
business and are not spending their own money. But at Y33,000 a night for a
room and occupancy dropping anyway because of the economic downturn at home,
'we assume this year there will be fewer autumn bookings from abroad,' says
Mr Inaba. 'We are thinking what to do about it.'

THE international tele-communications companies of Portugal and Brazil have
formed a strategic alliance which plans to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m)
in upgrading services and promoting joint ventures in third countries.
The non-exclusive alliance between Marconi of Portugal and Embratel of
Brazil is the latest in a series of international telecoms deals aimed at
expanding the market for multinationals and exploiting opportunities in
developing regions. With joint annual turnover of Dollars 1.7bn last year,
the companies will form one of the smaller of the new alliances. It builds
on existing commercial and technical co-operation between them.
The Portuguese-Brazilian link partially mirrors a strong advance by Spain's
telecoms monopoly, Telefonica, into the telecoms market in former Spanish
colonies in Latin America. Telefonica has bought control of operating
companies in Argentina and Chile in the past three years.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Mexico promises to increase minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday instructed the labour ministry to raise
Mexico's minimum wage of 13 pesos (Pounds 2.80) a day by national average
productivity increases. He announced the move in a national television
broadcast celebrating the end of negotiations on side agreements to the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
The comments appeared to have been intended as much for the US as Mexico. In
the US Congress, fears that factories will move to Mexico to take advantage
of low Mexican wages have underlined much of the opposition to the trade
pact.
The purchasing power of Mexico's minimum wage has steadily fallen over the
past decade, a result of inflation, low economic growth, and a deliberate
government policy.
However, few Mexicans earn the minimum wage, and the new policy is expected
to have a limited impact. While US officials had heralded President
Salinas's speech an important development, a spokesman for Mr Salinas
categorically denied that any deal had been done with the US administration
over wages. 'There is nothing new in this,' he said.
The broadcast came after Mexico made concessions over the labour and
environmental side agreements, accommodating US demands that the agreements
should have 'teeth'.
The rally in Mexico's stockmarket, which closed 3.8 per cent ahead
yesterday, indicates why the government was willing to make the concessions.
Nafta is expected by investors to boost Mexico's short term economic growth,
accelerate its integration with the industrialised world, and lock in
current economic policies for the foreseeable future.
For these reasons President Salinas has been willing to turn his back on
Mexico's traditional definition of national sovereignty. It is almost
inconceivable that any previous Mexican president would have negotiated
Nafta, let alone willingly submitted Mexico to transnational adjudication in
environmental matters.
Given the lengthy and complicated process involved in punishing violators of
environmental laws, the side agreement on environment is unlikely to have
any immediate impact. Mexico's lack of funds, inexperience in environmental
enforcement, and unwillingness to close factories where under-employment and
poverty exist all mean enforcement in Mexico will probably lag behind that
in the US and Canada for some time.
Mexico made few significant concessions on labour, agreed to share
information with a tri-national commission but not to be bound by any of its
recommendations. The US had been nervous about pressing for a labour
commission with wide powers, for reasons of its own national sovereignty.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, in an attempt to break the impasse with the Russian
parliament over elections in the autumn, yesterday suggested an alternative
decision-making body should be created, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow.
He told leaders of Russia's 20 republics a new Federation Council, with two
representatives from each of Russia's 89 regions and republics, could
'legitimately solve many questions'.
'Then nobody could reproach it for being another conference - it would be an
organ of power,' he said, referring to the Constitutional Conference he set
up to process a new constitution after the Russian parliament refused to
abandon the existing Soviet-era constitution. Although he did not elaborate,
one of the tasks of the new body, which Mr Yeltsin offered to create by
presidential decree if the regions and republics agreed to it, could be to
clear the way for elections.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Currency surge 'could prolong slowdown'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN yesterday climbed towards the Y100 level against the dollar, with
persistent intervention by the Bank of Japan in the Tokyo foreign exchange
market only partially curbing its advance.
Tourist rates in the capital broke through Y100 to the dollar for the first
time.
In a flurry of press conferences, Japanese government agencies and ministers
from the new seven-party ruling coalition voiced renewed concern that the
appreciation of the yen, in hampering exports, was in danger of prolonging
the country's economic slowdown.
The yen closed in Tokyo at a record Y102.40 to the dollar compared with
Y103.37 on Thursday and Y104.35 a week ago. It touched Y101.80 during the
day. Dealers said the central bank entered the market to sell yen for
dollars and may also have bought D-Marks.
Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, deputy director general of the Economic Planning Agency,
blamed the appreciation of the yen on the upheavals in the European Monetary
System. He called on European Community monetary authorities to act swiftly
in stabilising their currencies.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, who took over as finance minister on Monday, said after a
morning cabinet meeting that Japan would liaise with other leading
industrialised countries and was 'ready to take appropriate and timely steps
against undesirable market developments'.
Mr Jiro Saito, his deputy, added later that Japan was urging the other Group
of Seven economic powers to help stem a rise against the dollar which he
described as 'too fast.' He noted that a G7 agreement in April to co-operate
in stabilising the main traded currencies remained in force.
Their comments were taken in the market to indicate that the Bank of Japan
will continue its efforts to rein back the yen. Analysts also thought a
further cut in the official discount rate, perhaps of as much as half a
percentage point from the current 2.5 per cent, may be in prospect by next
month.
Indications in the spring that the domestic slowdown might have bottomed out
have given way in recent weeks to fears that the economy has entered a
double-dip, although Mr Saito rejected this yesterday.
Indicating its conservative budgetary approach, the cabinet yesterday
decided to hold the overall increase in government spending next year to 3.8
per cent, the lowest in four years, while leaving room for a 5 per cent
growth in public fixed investment.
Economic indicators released yesterday gave little cause for optimism. The
Bank of Japan said domestic wholesale prices for last month were unchanged
from June and down 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, assisted by cheaper oil
imports because of the stronger yen - ministries are in dispute about to
what extent these should be passed on to consumers.
Bankruptcies in July, according to Teikoku Data Bank, exceeded 1,000 for the
sixth successive month but the liabilities involved were down 23.3 per cent
year-on-year. This was in spite of the fact that they included the collapse
of Nikkatsu, a film producer, with debts of nearly Y50bn.

Romanian train drivers yesterday vowed to step up their three-day strike
following a supreme court decision declaring their action illegal, reports
Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Union leaders reacted angrily to the ruling and told the drivers to go on
'all-out strike' until demands for a 15 per cent pay rise and new pay
differentials were met. The drivers had previously operated limited
emergency services.
The strike has brought the country's railways to a near standstill and,
because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, blocked the only east-west
route for international rail traffic travelling through the Balkans.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Side deals on Nafta give accord 'bite'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement
negotiated by the US, Mexico and Canada lay down principles and objectives
for labour and environmental protection standards in the three countries.
But they also establish a disputes procedure that trade ministers claim will
give real bite to the pact.
'These are historic, groundbreaking agreements and have real teeth,' Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, said yesterday.
The disputes procedure has been the main sticking point in negotiations over
the last week, with Canada firmly resisting US demands for trade sanctions
to be levied if a country does not live up to its obligations under Nafta.
Telephone talks dragged from Monday, when formal negotiations broke up,
until early yesterday morning, before a compromise was found that accepts a
different procedure for Canada than that applied to the US and Mexico.
The disputes mechanism aims to punish the failure by central or local
governments in the three countries to enforce their own labour or
environmental laws, rather than the actual breach of those laws by a company
or individual.
If complaints of non-enforcement brought by one country against another
cannot be satisfied by consultations, an arbitration panel of experts may be
set up, on the vote of two out of the three Nafta signatories.
This panel can rule that a country 'has engaged in a persistent pattern of
failure to effectively enforce.' If no action plan to remedy this failure
can be agreed on, it can then fine the offending government up to Dollars
20m - a maximum that will be adjusted upwards as the volume of trade between
the three countries increases.
The split between the negotiators involved the action that would be taken if
a country refused to pay this fine or continued in its failure to enforce
its labour or environmental laws.
If the US or Mexico defies a panel ruling, the complaining country may
impose trade sanctions by suspending the Nafta benefits in proportion to the
amount of the fine. This would in effect mean tariffs being raised back
towards pre-Nafta levels in specified areas.
Canada, however, has insisted that its own courts should enforce the fine
and the action plan.
'The Canadians, with I think some credibility, said their courts were
perfectly competent to enforce these orders,' said Mr Kantor, adding that
the Canadian courts would not be able to review or hear appeals against a
Nafta panel ruling.
The key principles of the labour agreement - clearly targeted at Mexico -
require each country to promote freedom of association, the right to strike
and to bargain collectively, a ban on forced labour, restrictions on child
labour, equal pay for men and women, compensation for work accidents and the
protection of migrant workers.
While the disputes procedure takes aim only at a country's failure to
enforce its laws, rather than at any possible inadequacy in those laws, the
Nafta does require each signatory to improve working conditions and living
standards over time, with annual reviews set up under the side agreements.
US trade unions have been critical of Nafta, which they believe will allow
Mexico to suck jobs away from the US because of lower wages and weaker
worker protection and safety standards.
Conservation groups have complained that the treaty would encourage
companies to set up dirty factories on the Mexican side of the border, where
they would be subjected to lower pollution control standards.
The environmental pact does not set out a list of principles, but the three
countries commit themselves to high levels of environmental protection.
Under the agreements, no country may lower its standards of environmental or
labour protection: new laws must set higher standards.
Mexico and the US also agreed to set up a border environment institution to
co-ordinate and finance action on water and solid waste pollution in the
region along their common frontier.
No agreement has yet been reached on the amount of money needed for this -
estimates have ranged from around Dollars 7bn to Dollars 30bn - but Mr
Kantor insisted this would be completed in time for the whole Nafta
agreement to be submitted formally to the US Congress in September.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Seoul orders halt to strike at Hyundai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government yesterday decided to use its emergency powers
for a second time within a month to end a strike at Hyundai, the country's
largest conglomerate.
It ordered that workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's
shipbuilding subsidiary, immediately to suspend their industrial action and
return to work as a 20-day cooling off period takes effect.
HHI and Hyundai Wood Industries, a furniture company, are the last two of
nine companies affected by strikes that plagued Hyundai since early June.
The strike at HHI, which began July 5, has cost the group Dollars 198m
(Pounds 135m) in lost sales, including Dollars 124m in exports.
The government said it was taking the action because of HHI's importance to
the economy as the country's largest shipbuilder.
Negotiations at HHI have become bogged down over the trade union's demand
that workers fired for labour activity should be reinstated and that the
managers who sacked the workers should be reprimanded.
The government also intervened last month in a dispute at Hyundai Motor, the
nation's largest car maker, which led to a quick settlement of the strike.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Xanana Gusmao, the East Timorese rebel leader sentenced to life
imprisonment by Indonesia last May, yesterday had his jail term reduced to
20 years. Diplomats say President Suharto's decision is in response to
international criticism of Jakarta's human rights record.
Amnesty International, the human rights group, said Mr Gusmao's trial
'failed to meet international standards of fairness,' noting his defence
plea was suppressed and his choice of lawyer denied.
Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, a move
not recognised by the United Nations. In his defence plea Mr Gusmao, who led
the Fretilin separatist movement, accused Indonesia of 'killing my people.
Small and weak, they have always been subjected to foreign rule'.
Government officials say Mr Gusmao has since accepted he had acted
wrongfully in opposing Indonesian rule.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S financial markets yesterday discovered what President Kim
Young-sam meant when he said that his political and economic reforms
involved 'pain-sharing'.
The Korean stock market tumbled and other financial institutions were thrown
into paralysis after President Kim's surprise announcement ordering an
immediate ban on use of aliases in financial transactions, his latest move
against corruption and the large underground economy.
Businessmen were seen weeping in restaurants when news of the swift
presidential action broke Thursday night, but the general public welcomed
the move as an appropriate come-uppance for the wealthy and powerful who
tried to hide their fortunes from tax collectors.
'I'm in real trouble. What am I going to do?' said a 23-year-old false name
account holder working for a foreign firm.
Although stock trading was restricted to two hours in the afternoon, brokers
were inundated by selling orders, totalling 100m shares with an estimated
value of Won2,000bn (Pounds 1.6bn), as investors tried to liquidate stock
portfolios held under false names.
However, trading limits prevented the market from crashing, curbing the
decline to a 4.46 per cent fall for the Korean composite index, which ended
at 693 against 725 on Thursday. All but three shares declined to their daily
bottom limit on the bourse.
The lack of buyers meant that stock trading was unusually light at 1.3m
shares, compared with last week's average of 15m shares.
Under the emergency presidential decree, those engaged in financial
transactions had to produce identification to prove ownership of their
accounts, a procedure that brought some financial operations to a grinding
halt.
Tempers flared at banks as customers came to withdraw money for the
Independence Day holiday weekend and were told they had to prove that their
real name matched the name on the account. Customers complained they were
unable to make withdrawals from their own accounts.
'This is ridiculous,' said a European businessman who had to wait an hour to
identify himself due to computer problems that plagued the banks yesterday.
The problem was particularly difficult for wives who wanted to make a
withdrawal from an account held in their husband's name, since it is common
practice in Korea for them to keep their maiden name. Many had to go to
local government offices to get a certificate proving their married status.
The problems occurred despite intensive training given yesterday morning to
bank staff on how to identify customers before the banks were opened late at
2 pm.
But troubles in identifying customers were not confined to the banks. 'I
couldn't recognise one long-time client when he identified himself on the
phone because he used his real name for the first time,' said one Korean
broker.
Brokers themselves were thrown in a panic over the real-name system since
many use aliases in stock trading to evade a law banning them from making
investments.
Some of those who pulled money from their false-name accounts were trying to
keep their wealth hidden from the authorities by buying gold and jewellery,
prices for which rose sharply on the black market yesterday.
Meanwhile, many short-term lenders on the kerb market remained closed as
they complemented the threat of a liquidity drain as false-name account
holders pull money from the market, which has been the traditional centre
for speculative investments.
A squeeze on the kerb market could cause problems for small and medium
companies, which rely on the market for capital.
Mr Lee Kyung-shik, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs,
acknowledged that this and other problems may be caused by the introduction
of the real-name system.
'The real-name system may affect the financial and stock markets, cause
financing difficulties for small and medium business, encourage property
speculation and trigger capital flight in the short-term. We are taking
steps to minimise these short-term effects,' he said.
"But in the long term, it will promote economic growth as it is expected to
channel underground money into the industrial sector.'
Some analysts predict that the shock to the stock market will ease by the
middle of the next week. 'We expect the market will bottom out at around 650
as investors take advantage of buying opportunities,' said Mr Richard
Samuelson of S G Warburg Securities in Seoul.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Portugal-Brazil strategic telecoms alliance formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and SARAH PROVAN
</BYLINE>

   LONDON, LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international tele-communications companies of Portugal and Brazil have
formed a strategic alliance which plans to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m)
in upgrading services and promoting joint ventures in third countries.
The non-exclusive alliance between Marconi of Portugal and Embratel of
Brazil is the latest in a series of international telecommunications deals
aimed at expanding the market for multinationals and exploiting
opportunities in developing regions.
With joint annual turnover of Dollars 1.7bn last year, the companies will
form one of the smaller of the new alliances. It builds on existing
commercial and technical co-operation between the companies.
Mr Sequeira Braga, president of Marconi, said: 'To survive as international
operators we have to establish alliances to compete.' He said the initial
focus of the alliance would be on service improvements and co-operative
marketing.
The Portuguese-Brazilian link partially mirrors a strong advance by the
Spanish telecoms monopoly, Telefonica, into the telecoms market in former
Spanish colonies in Latin America. Telefonica has bought control of
operating companies in Argentina and Chile in the past three years.
The alliance also indicates Marconi's determination to assert itself in the
run-up to privatisation. The Portuguese government holds just over 50 per
cent of the company and it is assumed that Portugal's three telephone
operators will at some stage be drawn into the government's wide-ranging
privatisation programme.
Lisbon has had most success so far in privatising the banking sector, and
the telephone company said yesterday no concrete plans yet existed to sell
stakes in Marconi or the other two companies, TLP, which operates in Lisbon
and Oporto, and Telecom Portugal, both fully owned by the state.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMANDERS of the Bosnian Serb militia and of Moslem-led government forces
have agreed on 'lines of withdrawal' from strategic Mount Igman overlooking
Sarajevo, removing an obstacle that has stalled peace talks due to resume in
Geneva next week.
All Serb forces on Igman must withdraw beyond the agreed lines by 1400 GMT
today, General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said
last night.
He and UN chief of staff Brigadier Vere Hayes said the new lines removed the
last stumbling block to the resumption of the peace talks in Geneva. 'From
my point of view the impasse is over,' Gen Briquemont said.
UN officials had been meeting Bosnian Serb leaders in Sarajevo to resolve
the dispute over the Serb withdrawal.
Brig Hayes said about 250 French UN troops had moved into areas from which
Serb forces were now steadily leaving and Moslem-led government forces had
pledged not to try to retake them. He indicated the UN would use force to
resist any incursions.
But Commander Barry Frewer, spokesman for UN forces in Sarajevo, said he
could not confirm earlier Serb claims that their forces had withdrawn from
Mount Igman, which they overran last week.
In Geneva, international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg
yesterday postponed peace talks until Monday.
It was hoped the two-day break would give UN peacekeepers in Sarajevo time
to settle the Igman dispute and allow the Moslem-led government, the Croats
and the Serbs to prepare negotiating positions for full-scale talks.
Mr John Mills, their spokesman, said the pause would allow time for the
inspection of a ceasefire line by Brig Hayes and a Bosnian Serb commander,
General Manojlo Milovanovic, around Mount Igman.
Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday said he would insist on the
lifting of the Serb siege round Sarajevo on Monday when talks on the
republic's ethnic division are scheduled to resume.
Asked whether he expected Nato airstrikes to lift the Serb siege, he was
dismissive: 'As you see the peace talks were on the verge of collapse, but
the west did not do anything.'
The weekend postponement is likely to slow the growing momentum in calls for
western military intervention to break the 17-month siege of Sarajevo.
In Washington, US officials yesterday sought to play down earlier threats
that they would call for Nato air strikes if the Serbs did not withdraw from
the mountain.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said the US was not yet ready to
ask for military action, although he called on the Serbs to end their
'strangulation' of Sarajevo.
Amid signs that the European allies remained nervous of pressing ahead with
action too rapidly, the Russian Foreign Ministry sought to distance itself
from the threatened air strikes.
Meanwhile, publicity over the plight of Sarajevo prompted several European
countries to step up their humanitarian efforts to the city. In Britain the
first stage of an airlift got under way to bring out a group of severely
injured victims from the city.
The Overseas Development Agency in London said an aircraft was flying from
Britain to the Ancona airbase in Italy, where 41 victims to be evacuated
from Sarajevo will be picked up this weekend. The Swedish Foreign Ministry
said it was set to bring out 14 seriously injured Bosnians.
In Sarajevo, UN officials called for more aid for the city, and a British
doctor questioned the UN list of the victims, saying he had seen more
pressing cases in the hospitals.
Serbia has appealed to the International Court in The Hague over alleged
Bosnian massacres of Serb civilians. The court is due to hear similar
accusations, made against the Serbs, on August 25.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Lagos says bomb plot uncovered: Terrorist campaign blamed on
'disgruntled politician'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government stepped up its propaganda campaign against its
opponents yesterday, claiming it had uncovered a plot by 'terrorists' to
carry out a bombing campaign in three big cities, including the capital.
Mr Uche Chukwumerije, information minister, alleged that a 'disgruntled
politician' was funding a destabilisation plan from August 16 to 25 which
would create a 'national atmosphere of insecurity' by a series of explosions
in Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna.
Although the statement did not identify the politician, most Nigerians
assumed it referred to Chief Moshood Abiola, the victorious candidate in the
June presidential poll which was annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida.
A civil disobedience campaign in support of Mr Abiola's claim to be the next
president of Nigeria stopped business in Lagos and other south-western
cities for the second day yesterday, but once again failed to win support
outside the south-west, the Yoruba homeland of Mr Abiola.
Mr Chukwumerije said the plot also involved blowing up the north-south oil
pipeline from Port Harcourt to Kaduna and the same conspirator was giving
N10m (Pounds 270,000) to the Nigeria Labour Congress and other dissident
activists 'to step up their opposition to the government'.
He urged Nigerians of the folly of 'suicide missions on behalf of a fleeing
field marshal. . . at a safe distance at the headquarters of ITT in the US'
 -a reference to Mr Abiola, who once represented the telecommunications
giant in Nigeria.
Mr Abiola has been in the US and UK to lobby for punitive measures against
the military regime if it does not hand over to an elected civilian
government on August 27. This has led to speculation that it may be
difficult for Mr Abiola, now in London, to return to Nigeria and pursue his
claim on the presidency.
A spokesman in the president's office denied knowledge of the source of the
allegations. The period they involve covers the run-up to the formation of
an unelected interim government, which Mr Abiola and most of his supporters
have denounced.
The president may reveal details of the interim government in an address to
the National Assembly on Monday or Tuesday at a parade on his birthday in
Abuja, the new federal capital.
On August 23, four days before the scheduled handover, the government is
also set to remove partially the petroleum price subsidy. A new high-grade
petrol will cost 10 times as much as the present official price, which is a
mere 3 US cents per litre.
The timing of the move is surprising. It is certain to be highly unpopular
and was put back by the government in April because it might have led to
riots just before the presidential elections. It prompted speculation
yesterday that protests on the August 23 might provide a pretext for the
government to stay in office.
In the civil disobedience campaign, there was a slightly increased turnout
by staff in the private sector and public transport was working. The
government threat to discipline civil servants who stayed away had a limited
effect in Lagos. Despite the absence of some senior officials from the
Central Bank of Nigeria in Lagos, there were enough junior staff at work to
process the weekly bids for Dollars 60m of foreign exchange submitted by
about a third of the authorised commercial banks.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Perilous problems of EC capital controls: The hunt for ERM
scapegoats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE hunt for scapegoats for the ERM debacle, foreign exchange dealers
present tempting targets. In recent days, ministers in France and Belgium
have called for tighter curbs on international currency to curb the power of
the 'financial speculators'.
These calls enjoy wider support on the Continent than might be imagined.
Only last year, Ireland, Portugal and later Spain all imposed temporary
exchange controls to protect their embattled currencies. Some EC member
states made similar noises at the emergency EC finance ministers' meeting in
Brussels on August 2 which led to the de facto suspension of the ERM,
according to a senior monetary source.
But the political and financial costs of introducing anything which could be
interpreted as the re-imposition of capital controls look prohibitive. Such
moves would split the EC into a free-trade camp led by the UK, Germany and
the Netherlands and a more dirigiste-minded rump, and would be a severe blow
to the single market.
As one senior European finance official said this week: 'It would mean
destroying the present currency market, and that is why I think it is
inconceivable. Yet I can imagine that it will be proposed. There would be
accusations that we are building not only a trade fortress but a monetary
fortress too.'
EC finance ministers will debate various options at a meeting in Brussels on
September 13. Their preference will be for a Community approach rather than
allowing 'wild-cat' operations by individual member states.
One option likely to be discussed is temporary curbs on overall capital
movements of the kind which existed in the UK up to 1979 and which were
still in force in many European countries until the mid-1980s.
Under Article 3 of the EC directive providing for the free movement of
capital, member states can impose 'protective measures' for up to 180 days
to deal with adverse currency movements affecting their exchange rate and
monetary policies, subject to approval by the European Commission and
opinions of the EC's monetary committee and EC Central Bank governors.
Spain, Ireland, and Portugal all invoked this clause last year, and won
retrospective endorsement from the Commission. This made it difficult for
individuals or banks to borrow a currency quickly in the hope of selling it
in currency markets. Similar 'safeguard' measures to defend national
currencies exist under Article 73 of the Maastricht treaty.
The drawback is that the country which re-imposed such controls would face a
heavy financial burden, because it would unwind the heavy international
investment in European bond and equity markets that has accompanied the
single market programme.
Spanish equity market prices fell sharply after the government's imposed
temporary controls to defend the peseta. Some economists have pointed out
that it would be extraordinary for France to re-impose such controls at a
time when it is privatising some of its biggest state enterprises through
stock market flotations.
Alternatively, a government could tax the foreign exchange profits of the
main commercial banks operating within its borders. But in the global
24-hour market, banks could easily respond by shifting operations offshore.
A tax on the profits of commercial banks might not hit the currency
speculators, either. In the recent ERM crises, the principal movers of
capital have been hedge funds based in New York and pension funds all over
the world who own international assets. Commercial bank dealers could argue
that their main role is as intermediaries between the main players.
However, one leading figure in the London foreign exchange market suggested
yesterday that France could consider legislation that would force commercial
banks on its territory to lodge funds with the central bank in amounts that
match their lending to overseas parties.
In recent ERM crises, the method by which international speculators have
operated has been to borrow francs from French banks in huge quantities,
sell the currency and then buy it back at a cheaper exchange rate.
If commercial banks had to lodge a sum with the central bank that was
equivalent to their overseas lendings, they would in effect lose any
interest premium on the loan.
This method of controlling speculation was used by the Bank of England in
the 1970s under the 'corset' scheme and in Germany in the so-called
Bar-Depot scheme.
'It would be hard to implement, and would probably need all the OECD
countries acting together,' said the London banker. 'But I would not be
surprised if the Bank of France were considering such a move this week.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / French chief for EBRD likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France, is almost certain
to be the next president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, after the Italian government yesterday withdrew its support
from the Italian candidate, Professor Guiliano Amato.
Mr Giuseppe Maresca, the Italian director at the EBRD, said he had received
a communication from his government yesterday morning, saying it would no
longer be supporting Prof Amato, a former Italian prime minister.
Mr Maresca said he had been unable to establish yesterday whether the third
candidate, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz of Poland, had decided to continue in the
contest. But Mr Maresca said it was almost certain that Mr de Larosiere
would be elected. The decision to withdraw Prof Amato had been taken in
close consultation with Prof Amato himself.
The French Foreign Ministry yesterday welcomed the news. A spokesman said:
'We have no confirmation yet that Mr de Larosiere is the only candidate. But
we think he will be elected now.'
The announcement marks the end of several weeks of intense political
lobbying among the European countries over the successor to Mr Jaques
Attali, the former president of the EBRD, who resigned last month after
allegations of financial mismanagement and lavish spending.
Although Mr de Larosiere had initially been considered the most likely
candidate, the decision by the Italian government last month to submit Prof
Amato as a nominee threatened to cause an embarrassing diplomatic split
among the European governors.
However, French diplomatic lobbying, and a desire on the part of the EC
officials to present a show of European unity, appear to have forced the
Italians to back down.
The voting will close on August 18 and the result announced on August 19, or
earlier if Mr de Larosiere remains the sole candidate.

FT  14 AUG 93 / French industrial production down 1.9% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pressures on the French economy were highlighted yesterday by
publication of official figures showing that industrial production fell 1.9
per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous
quarter and 4.7 per cent against the first quarter last year.
Yesterday's industrial production figures, released by Insee, the state
statistics institute, reflect the downward trend of previous monthly
estimates but show an unexpectedly sharp output fall for capital goods, such
as aerospace and industrial equipment.
The strains on industry appeared to have alleviated slightly in the second
quarter. The provisional production figures for April showed a 0.6 per cent
decline from March, but the May figures showed a 0.2 per cent increase. The
June figures will be published on Tuesday.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, recently used these figures as
evidence that the French economy had stabilised because of the impact of the
reductions in interest rates since the centre-right government took power
this spring.
However, there is so far no evidence of a recovery in activity. The recent
round of first-half turnover figures from French companies has painted a
gloomy picture of reduced sales across the corporate sector. A number of
leading industrial groups yesterday reported falls in first half sales
including Michelin, the tyre maker, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals and the
Bouygues construction company.
'The corporate sector may have stabilised but there is absolutely no sign of
a pick-up in demand,' said Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at
James Capel in Paris. 'Companies won't feel the full impact of lower
interest rates until early next year.'

FT  14 AUG 93 / Spain waters down plan for wages curb
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S minority Socialist government yesterday stepped back from a
potentially bruising battle with trade unions by withdrawing proposals for a
total wage freeze next year.
The retreat came less than a month after the idea was first launched and
reflects deep cabinet disquiet about how tough an approach could be adopted
in cutting wages and public spending in order to help drag the country out
of recession.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is keen to get agreement from the unions and
employers in the next few weeks on a three-year incomes policy that,
initially, was to have included a total freeze on wages and dividends next
year, and a rise below inflation in 1995.
Unions quickly turned on the freeze and appear to have scared the government
into relaxing the proposal. Mr Alfredo Pastor, deputy economics minister,
said after meeting union leaders that the government would now be looking to
hold private sector pay rises to 2.5 per cent next year. Union leaders
welcomed the movement as 'intelligent' but would not say if they accepted
that figure as a maximum.
Mr Pastor was less explicit about dividends, though he indicated a similar
small rise might be acceptable. He implied the government would hold to its
promise to freeze civil service pay next year but left open what would
happen to wages in public companies.
The government appeared to be justifying its relaxed wages target by saying
that a small rise would help boost domestic spending. Mr Pastor said GDP was
expected to grow 0.7 per cent next year, nearly all accounted for by
exports.
Pay settlements in Spain are running at over 6 per cent so far this year. Mr
Pastor said he expected inflation of around 3 per cent for 1994, a target
the Spanish have been declaring and missing for nearly five years. July
inflation figures out yesterday showed annualised price rises stable at 4.9
per cent, better than the markets had feared, but underlying inflation
remained high at 5.9 per cent.
Mr Gonzalez has evidently calculated that a concession on wages next year
was worth paying to get a quick deal on incomes as informal inter-party
negotiations on passing next year's budget begin to take shape. He needs a
pay deal by the time the budget reaches parliament in autumn.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Judge faces probe in Italy scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Diego Curto, one of the most senior judges on the company law bench at
Milan's court of justice, has been placed under investigation in Italy's
18-month political corruption scandal.
The move followed an inter-rogation on Thursday at which Mr Curto, who has
been practising law in Milan for the past 34 years, was questioned about his
role in the period before the demise of the Enimont chemicals concern.
Executives at Montedison, the industrial arm of the troubled Ferruzzi group,
allegedly paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) in kickbacks to politicians during
the lifetime of Enimont, the ill-fated chemicals joint venture between
Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group.
Attention turned to Mr Curto after the arrest last month of Mr Vincenzo
Palladino, deputy chair-man of Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's
most prestigious banks, on allegations regarding the Enimont affair.
Mr Palladino, who is also a prominent lawyer and business consultant, was
appointed legal guardian of a crucial packet of 80 per cent of Enimont's
shares by Mr Curto as the battle for control between Eni and Montedison
reached its peak in November 1990.
It has since emerged that Mr Palladino received L4.5bn for his efforts,
which lasted just 22 days. About half the money was allegedly paid into a
foreign bank account.
Because Mr Curto himself is a judge, the allegations against him of aiding
and abetting a crime will be investigated by magistrates in Brescia, which
is responsible for disciplinary matters in the Milan judicial district.
Mr Curto, who has presided over some of Italy's most heated corporate
battles, yesterday protested his innocence.

FT  14 AUG 93 / So where was Bernard Tapie? Time will tell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE tangled saga of Olympique-Marseille, the top French football team whose
officials are under investigation for rigging a match against Valenciennes
last season, has opened a farcical new chapter.
French police are trying to establish whether Mr Bernard Tapie, the team's
owner and a former Socialist minister, tried to bribe the Valenciennes
trainer to cover up the scandal.
The O-M scandal, which has dominated the French media throughout the summer,
erupted in June when a Valenciennes player admitted accepting FFr250,000
(Pounds 28,000) from O-M officials to play badly in a game so the Marseilles
club could beat his team.
The scandal broke new heights when Mr Boro Primorac, the Valenciennes team's
trainer, accused Mr Tapie of offering him a bribe at a meeting in Paris on
June 17 to take the blame for rigging the match.
Luckily for Mr Tapie one of his old cabinet colleagues, Mr Jacques Mellick,
mayor of Bethune in northern France, leapt to his defence by saying he was
with him in Paris from 2.30pm to 3.30pm on June 17, the time when Mr
Primorac said Mr Tapie was trying to bribe him.
But Mr Tapie's alibi seemed to fall apart this week when the police
discovered photographs of Mr Mellick addressing a meeting of town hall
employees in Bethune on June 17. The dateline on the pictures, taken by a
local agency, was 2pm.
Bethune town hall is 220km away from Mr Tapie's office. Mr Mellick could not
possibly have been there at 2pm and with Mr Tapie in Paris at 2.30pm.
Where was he?
Mr Mellick has insisted that he was in Mr Tapie's office. He claimed that he
was late for the meeting and arrived at the town hall at about 5pm. The
employees at the meeting have backed his story - to the police and the
French press.
The tide of public opinion seemed to be swinging in Mr Mellick's favour
until reports circulated that one of the photographs seized showed the watch
of Ms Brigitte Navez, a town hall employee, and that the time shown on the
watch did not tally with the mayor's story.
All the police have said is that their examination of the photograph was
inconclusive. One of Mr Mellick's aides said at a press conference that Ms
Navez's watch was known to be faulty. Meanwhile Mr Mellick, well aware that
his own reputation as well as Mr Tapie's hangs in the balance, has agreed to
be questioned by the judge investigating the O-M affaire.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Call to curb ERM speculators: Belgium joins France in urging
tighter controls on currency dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM, current president of the European Community, and France have joined
forces to call for tougher measures to stop currency speculators forcing
devaluations of currencies inside Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
The calls reflect growing political pressure on the European continent for
action to curb international trading practices in the currency markets,
tempered by a realisation of the political and financial risks involved.
On Thursday, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, blamed currency
speculators for the crisis in the ERM and called for reform of the
international monetary and financial system.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, said yesterday that
currency speculation was 'a type of transaction which does not know any
rules, no costs and no taxes'.
But an EC official said the reimposition of capital controls would split the
EC and damage the single European market. 'It is like using a nuclear
weapon,' he said.
The political pressure follows a month in which the credibility of the ERM
has been severely undermined by currency speculation. The EC finance
ministers agreed two weeks ago to widen the fluctuation bands in an effort
to save the system and staunch further selling of currencies, particularly
the French franc.
Yesterday the franc fell heavily against the D-Mark, dropping nearly 2 1/2
centimes to FFr3.538, its lowest ever close against the German currency. In
late New York trading it slipped to around FFr3.54.
The Danish krone also fell sharply for the second day running, dropping to
DKr4.1425 against the D-Mark after opening at DKr 4.1275. It recovered a
little in New York to DKr4.1330. The Dutch guilder also fell.
The principal reason for the franc's fall was this week's disclosure that
the Bank of France had negative net foreign currency reserves. Markets were
also unnerved by Mr Balladur's comments that France was considering exchange
controls.
At the close of ERM trading, there were almost 8 1/2 percentage points
dividing the strongest and weakest currencies, more than half the new 15 per
cent fluctuation band agreed on August 2.
EC ministers appear to be using psychological warfare to strengthen
currencies against speculative attack. Mr Maystadt said it would be
'imprudent' to narrow the ERM's new 15 per cent fluctuation margins without
first having perfected 'weapons of defence' to counter speculative
movements.
In La Libre Belgique, Mr Maystadt said he was not advocating a reimposition
of controls to stop the free movement of capital in the EC: 'But we must
find ways so it is no longer easy for speculators to place the (European
Monetary) System in difficulty.'
EC finance ministers are scheduled to discuss the ERM crisis on September 13
in Brussels. Without pre-empting the talks, Mr Maystadt suggested that they
may wish to discuss the possible use of 'safeguards', a reference to powers
contained in the 1988 EC capital movement directive.
Under Article 3 of the directive, the European Commission may authorise
member states to take protective measures lasting up to six months, 'where
short-term capital movements of exceptional magnitude impose severe strains
on foreign exchange markets and lead to serious disturbances in the conduct
of national monetary and exchange rate policies'.

FT  14 AUG 93 / NatWest in mortgage sell-off move to free capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank has written to some of its 230,000 mortgage
borrowers to say it is considering selling their mortgages. It intends to
offer investors debt securities backed by monthly mortgage repayments.
The move comes amid a surge in mortgage lending by UK banks and could lead
to a push towards such 'securitisation' of mortgages. Banks are keen on the
technique because it allows them to remove from their balance sheets assets
which otherwise absorb scarce capital.
Mortgage securitisation is common in the US, but has only been used
extensively in the UK by centralised mortgage lenders. Barclays pioneered
the technique among clearing banks with a single Pounds 175m issue in 1989,
but has not repeated it.
Mr Richard Ferrett, head of asset management, said the bank's National
Westminster Home Loans subsidiary had written to 5 per cent of borrowers. It
would not sell the mortgage of any customer who objected.
Mr Ferrett said customers would not be affected by securitisation because
NatWest would still set the repayment interest rates, and handle problems
such as customers not being able to meet monthly payments. He said the bank
had not yet decided when or in what form to securitise mortgages. It was
writing to customers as a courtesy, but they had signed authorisation
clauses when they took out their loan.
Although some Pounds 10bn of mortgage-backed securities have been issued in
the UK since 1987, the biggest lenders have largely avoided it. Some
building societies are working on the technique.
NatWest's mortgage lending has risen by Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 10.2bn over
the past year.
Barclays is known to be working on securitising both US and UK mortgages
through its BZW securities arm. Midland has also altered the terms of its
mortgages to securitise them, but said yesterday that it had no plans to do
so. Mr Ferrett said NatWest was willing to securitise fixed and variable
rate mortgages.
In order to securitise the mortgages, NatWest must set up an independent
company which could buy the mortgage portfolio and then issue securities.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Pact may clear way to free trading in N America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA, MEXICO and the US agreed measures yesterday that could clear the way
to implementing a comprehensive North American Free Trade Agreement,
creating a free trade zone of 370m people.
However, the measures to protect workers and the environment may not be
enough to make the US Congress back the deal. If approved by Congress, the
agreement is expected to be implemented next January.
In telephone negotiations late into Thursday night, Mexican and US officials
bowed to Canada's refusal to allow the treaty to be enforced through trade
sanctions against offending countries, ending an impasse that might have
blocked the agreement.
Under a compromise, Canada will have special treatment. Complaints brought
under the treaty against Mexico or the US would be enforced through trade
sanctions. In Canada, they will be enforced through the courts.
The original Nafta was agreed last year by former US president George Bush,
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, whose term ends in September next year,
and Mr Brian Mulroney, the former Canadian prime minister.
President Bill Clinton has insisted that he could not support the agreement
without the additional measures providing adequate protection for US workers
and for the environment. However, Canada's new prime minister, Ms Kim
Campbell, has resisted making concessions to US demands in the run-up to a
general election.
The so-called side agreements spell out principles of labour and
environmental protection, including commitments to equal pay for men and
women, restrictions on child labour and the right to strike. They provide
for any Nafta country to complain against the persistent failure of another
country to enforce its own laws in these areas.
If the complaint is upheld by an arbitration panel, the offending country
could be obliged to remedy its failure and be fined up to Dollars 20m
(Pounds 13m).
'In all of trade history, this is the first agreement that ever really got
any teeth in environmental standards, any teeth in what another country had
to do with its own workers and its own labour standards,' Mr Clinton said
yesterday.
But it is already clear that the side agreements reached this week have not
defused the hostility of trade union and environmentalist groups, which fear
Nafta could encourage jobs and polluting industries to migrate to Mexico,
where environmental laws are less stringent and workers' rights less well
protected.
Some US Congress members appeared satisfied by the new agreements. Senator
Max Baucus of Montana, who chairs the Senate environment committee, said he
was generally pleased. But Congressman Richard Gephardt, leader of the
Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and a key figure in the
vote on Nafta, said he could not support the agreement as it stood.
While most Republicans seem likely to support the deal, Mr Clinton is not
eager to force the trade treaty through against his own party's wishes, and
is equally reluctant to divert political capital from the battle to pass
healthcare reform, which is more central to his programme.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the chief US trade negotiator, acknowledged that it would
be difficult to win enough votes to pass Nafta. 'I think it is going to be a
very tough fight but I think we are going to win,' he said yesterday.

FT  14 AUG 93 / Fraud team freezes hundreds of BT3 share applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS have frozen the allocation of British Telecom shares to
several hundred individuals suspected of making illegal multiple
applications in the recent BT3 offer.
Fraud auditors at accountants Price Waterhouse are gathering more
information from prospective shareholders to determine whether they had made
more than one application each.
Some of those identified have not made multiple applications or have done so
as a result of honest mistakes, but others appear to have wilfully committed
offences which could lead to fines or imprisonment, the auditors said.
Investigators have traced multiple applicants through signs such as parents
applying on behalf of large numbers of children, individuals giving a
variant of the same name from different addresses, and apparently
unconnected applications supported by cheques from the same person.
The auditors' work has been based so far on manual inspection of tens of
thousands of application forms in the offices of the banks handling the
share offer.
This will be supplemented by computer analysis once the database containing
the amended BT share register has been delivered to Price Waterhouse.
Mr Keith Tilson, a privatisation partner at the firm, is co-ordinating the
fraud detection work. He said he felt instinctively that the proportion of
fraudulent applications was lower than in previous public share offerings.
He said this reflected factors including the smaller profits to be made on
'stagging' (selling the shares on immediately), than in earlier
privatisations and the end of the 1980s boom.
Others have been deterred by prosecutions and investigations against those
who made multiple applications for previous offers, and by the fact that BT3
applicants were pre-registered, giving time to filter out false identities.
Price Waterhouse does not expect to conclude its fraud audit until the end
of the year, when evidence will be passed to the police and the Crown
Prosecution Service.

FT  14 AUG 93 / UK shares close at new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 finished yesterday at a record close, completing a week in
which mounting expectations of a UK interest rate cut pushed the share index
through 3,000 for the first time, writes Emma Tucker.
The index closed up 40.3 on the week at 3,010.1, with Thursday's poor
economic news, including a sharp fall in UK manufacturing output and a small
rise in unemployment, encouraging hopes for an early loosening of monetary
policy.
This sentiment, together with a strong D-Mark, pushed the pound lower on the
foreign exchanges. Sterling ended the day down two pfennigs at DM2.4975.
There was good news for the government in the latest unit wage and
productivity figures published yesterday which showed that industry's
competitiveness continues to improve. Wages and salaries per unit of
manufacturing output fell by 3 per cent in the three months to the end of
June, compared with the same quarter a year ago, while productivity rose by
8.2 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for wood pulp was being made worse by the rising value of the
New Zealand dollar, Mr Selwyn Cushing, chairman of Carter Holt Harvey, New
Zealand's biggest forestry company, told yesterday's annual meeting.
Low international pulp prices were of concern, but there was more optimism
about returns from radiata logs and the group was cutting costs.
He said a downward correction in the high prices of radiata pine sawlogs on
export markets was inevitable. Radiata pine is the main plantation tree
grown in Carter Holt Harvey's forests in New Zealand and Chile. Prices had
risen because of stronger demand from Japan and Korea.
Mr Cushing said the company, managed by International Paper of New York, was
'uniquely well positioned to move forward with confidence."

<TEXT>
WESFARMERS, the Australian agribusiness group, lifted net earnings by 10.9
per cent to ADollars 70.5m (USDollars 47.6m) in the June year on a 36 per
cent sales rise to Dollars A1.7bn.
The annual dividend has been raised from 26 cents to 29 cents a share. The
results reflect a full-year contribution from the company's 47 per cent
owned associate, Bunnings, the Australian timber group.
Wesfarmers said it benefited from lower working capital requirements which
allowed interest expense to fall from ADollars 32.6m to ADollars 27.4m.
But the fertiliser division suffered from Australia's rural recession and
directors said the outlook remained subdued. The result excluded abnormal
profits of ADollars 3.8m against a ADollars 514,000 loss previously.
Tax provision took ADollars 34m against ADollars 39.5m and de-preciation
ADollars 68.3m against Dollars A59.1m.

FT  13 AUG 93 / South African economy puts on 5.1% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's economy grew by 5.1 per cent in the second quarter, according
to GDP figures published by the central statistical service yesterday,
suggesting that the country's four-year recession has ended.
The improvement compares with growth of 1.4 per cent in the first quarter.
The news coincides with publication of fiscal data which suggest government
finances are in reasonable shape. This follows speculation that the
government would overshoot its deficit target.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, said the continued growth in GDP vindicated
his view that the cyclical turning point to the downturn  - which started in
March 1989  - had been reached at the beginning of the year.
Most of the growth is attributable to the agricultural sector, which is
recovering from a devastating drought. Real agricultural production
increased by 231.5 per cent in the second quarter following first-quarter
growth of 53.9 per cent.
Mr Keys said other pleasing aspects of the figures were that secondary
industries continued to grow; growth in GDP owed nothing to higher
government spending; and mining production continued to rise at a rate of
2.5 per cent.

AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate slid to 10.7 per cent in July, bringing it
back to the level of April and May, the Bureau of Statistics reported
yesterday, Reuter reports from Sydney. But analysts said the drop in the
seasonally-adjusted rate from 11.1 per cent in June had more to do with
people giving up the search for work than a surge in the number of new jobs.
Employment was unchanged at 7.74m after rising by a total of 84,000 in May
and June.

ITALY'S price liberalisation took a small step forwards yesterday with the
removal of controls on milk, bread, cement and fertilisers, writes Haig
Simonian in Milan.
Prices of the four products were put under state control in 1974, although
the cost of cement was partially liberalised 11 years later.
The move is part of a gradual policy by the new government of prime minister
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to liberalise the economy and remove anachronistic
mechanisms.
Mr Luigi Spaventa, budget minister, said the move to let the market
determine prices had been taken because ministers felt there was adequate
competition.

FT  13 AUG 93 / German forex reserves rise by DM39.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S foreign exchange reserves rose by DM39.3bn (Dollars 22.8bn) in the
last week of July as a result of the currency turbulence preceding the
decision to widen currency bands in the European exchange rate mechanism and
thus avert speculative pressures.
The Bundesbank said in its weekly statement that the reserve total was now
DM157.9bn.
The sharp rise, caused by Bundesbank intervention to support ERM currrencies
under pressure  - predominantly the French franc  - only showed up in the
figures for the week to August 7 because foreign exchange transactions are
reported with a week's delay.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has said some DM60bn flowed
into Germany in July as a result of intervention in the ERM.
To offset the impact on money supply growth and inflation, it cut sharply
the weekly allocation of securities repurchase agreements (repos) in the
first week of August.
The rise in Bundesbank foreign exchange reserves the previous week was
DM7.7bn, also reflecting ERM intervention.
The overnight rate of lending in the German money market eased yesterday
after the Bundesbank surprised dealers on Wednesday by adding a net DM10.3bn
to the banking system.
The overnight rate hovered around 6.75 per cent after 6.80 per cent the
previous day. Some dealers said the high levels of liquidity had left the
market in a good position to meet a season of tax payments which should
start next week.
A central securities exchange supervisory authority is needed to make
Frankfurt more attractive as a financial centre, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports. 'But we must do several things to
make the Frankfurt exchange centre so attractive that it can contend on a
Europe-wide and worldwide level,' he said in a TV interview.
Mr Waigel also said he was in the process of drawing up a law on insider
trading abuses.

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMANIA's railway network was brought to a near standstill yesterday after a
train drivers' strike over pay continued into a second day.
Only 26 services were operating normally yesterday morning and no
international trains ran throughout the day, according to the Ministry of
Transport.
The western and southern parts of the country were particularly affected,
Radio Bucharest said.
The SNCFR, the state-owned railway administration, said it would seek to
have the strike declared illegal at a court hearing scheduled for today.
Romanian regulations stipulate that even during a general strike at least
one third of trains must run. A Bucharest court recently ruled that the
train drivers' previous strike in June was illegal on these grounds.
The strike is the latest in a growing number of labour conflicts, mainly
over pay as workers try to cope with three-digit inflation and without
subsidised food and energy.
Romanian road workers have said they too will go on strike next week if
their pay demands are not met. A warning strike last week blocked Romania's
border points with Hungary and Bulgaria for two hours.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE on the use of the Hungarian language in southern Slovakia has
flared again and threatens to damage further already troubled relations
between Bratislava and Budapest.
The latest row centres on a recent Slovak government order to remove all
Hungarian-Slovak bilingual road signs in a region which is home to the bulk
of a 600,000 strong ethnic Hungarian minority.
The decision follows an about-turn last month on a package of laws designed
to protect the language rights of the country's Hungarian minority. Voting
on the laws was postponed until after Slovakia's admission to the Council of
Europe was secured at the end of June. The Slovak parliament approved the
laws in mid-July but they were rejected by the government a week later.
The latest move has brought protests from local politicians and newspapers,
and the mayor of Marcelova in the Komarno district, announced he would
impose a blockade of all the roads into his municipality until the
government withdraws the order and bilingual signs are returned.
A government spokesman said yesterday the road block was illegal, and that
the order applied to all regions.

FT  13 AUG 93 / French consumer prices rise in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French consumer prices increased slightly in July, rising 0.1-0.2 per cent
above the level in June, according to figures published yesterday by Insee,
the national statistics office, writes John Ridding.
The figures, which give an annual rate of inflation of 2.1-2.2 per cent,
were welcomed by the Economics Ministry, which said they confirmed the
'strong state of French competitiveness'. A spokesman for the ministry said
they would support the French franc in the medium term.
Economists in Paris said that the figures were at the lower end of forecasts
and that the rise reflected the impact of indirect taxes and a relatively
strong rise in the cost of services.
Petrol taxes were increased at the beginning of July, although the full
effect of the price increase is not expected to be felt until August or
September.
Prices for services increased by an average of 0.4 per cent, partly
reflecting higher costs in hotels and restaurants resulting from higher
taxes on alcohol.
The low rate of inflation is also a result of the depressed state of
consumer demand in the recession-hit economy. Separate statistics published
yesterday by Insee confirmed the difficulties facing the economy.
According to a survey by the statistics institute, French industrialists
said they expected economic activity to stabilise in the second half of the
year but saw no signs of recovery before the end of 1993.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Spain's recession easing, say banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain and one of the country's biggest commercial banks said
yesterday they believed Spain's recession was easing. They predict that the
decline in gross domestic product will slow slightly in the second half of
the year, indicating the economic downturn may have bottomed out.
The Spanish central bank says in its latest economic bulletin it expects GDP
to fall by 1 per cent in the second half, compared with the official 1.1 per
cent fall in the first half.
Banco Central Hispano (BCH) said the slide in GDP had stabilised at minus
1.1 per cent since March, which it took as a sign that 'the fall in economic
activity may have touched bottom.'
BCH said the brake in recession was because of strong growth in exports
following three peseta devaluations since last autumn, and a sharp fall in
imports as internal demand has withered.
BCH said it expected a further slowdown of the fall in output. However, both
BCH and the Bank of Spain insisted that any stop to job losses would also
depend heavily on the success of current efforts by the government to agree
a three-year incomes policy, with the unions agreeing to freeze wages next
year and employers promising to freeze dividend payments at their present
levels.
The unions argue strongly against a wage freeze, and they say a dividends
freeze is pointless while so many companies are making losses.
Spain's economic planners blame high wage growth for the country's inability
to hold inflation down and the central bank said it was 'worried' about the
growth of prices and wages in the first half of the year. It said further
interest rate cuts would depend on the success of wages talks and the fiscal
discipline shown in the 1994 budget.
The Bank recently cut its benchmark lending rate to 10.5 per cent and is
thought to be reluctant to make another cut at its regular auction of
repurchase agreements today as July inflation figures due out late in the
morning are expected to be poor.

FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie edges into higher territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUOYANT London stock market again resisted discomforting news from UK
industry yesterday by holding on to its newly-established peak levels - but
only just. An early gain of 16.3 on the FT-SE Index largely disappeared as
the UK government bond market, reinforcing its influence over the investment
scene, fell sharply towards the end of the session.
By the close, the FT-SE Index was a mere 3 points up on the day at 3,009.1,
albeit a new closing high; a new intra-day peak of 3,022.4 was established
early.
Once again, the equity sector was strongly influenced by stock index
futures. The overseas investment institutions remained active but were
highly selective in the UK stock market.
Anticipation of a cut in UK base rates remained high, encouraged by firmness
in the German stock market on hopes of action by the Bundesbank.
The Footsie 100 Index was well-outpaced by the rise of 21.2 in the FT-SE Mid
250 Index to yet another new peak of 3,451.8. The Mid 250 Index, which
covers the range of stocks just below Footsie 100 capitalisation levels, and
is the favourite area for private client investment, has gained 4.2 per cent
since the beginning of the month, compared with 2.8 per cent on the FT-SE
100 Index.
Customer business in equities jumped to Pounds 1.82bn on Wednesday as the
Footsie Index soared through the 3,000 barrier. Seaq volume increased
yesterday to 908.2m shares from the 830.4m of the previous session.
Firmness in UK stock prices contrasted with news of a sharp fall of 2.1 per
cent in British manufacturing output in June, another increase in
unemployment but a contrasting dip in average earnings. Wednesday brought
news of dwindling confidence among British regional businessmen.
Share prices opened lower and the mid-morning upturn reflected activity in
stock index futures but also the initial gains in the UK gilts market.
Falling yields on UK government bonds have become a strongly bullish factor
for equities. 'Equities crash the gilt party,' commented the strategy team
at NatWest Securities yesterday, adding that it is to the gilt market that
we must turn to find an explanation for such an exhilarating equity
performance. NatWest Securities expects gilts to outperform equities over
the next year or so, with its FT-SE target of 3,300 at end-1994 offering a
real return of around 10 per cent over the next fifteen months.
Across the full range of the market, hopes for recovery in the domestic
economy dominated. Leadership was taken by the building materials and
construction groups which have everything to gain both from lower interest
rates and from increased economic activity. Financial and store issues,
which have outperformed the market over the past six months, came in for
some profit-taking pressure.
An easier trend in sterling worked in favour of the leading export blue
chips, which were also driven at first by demand from across the Atlantic.
However, US interest slackened when Wall Street opened the new session more
than 20 points down on the Dow Industrial Average.
The London stock market benefited from improvement in the pharmaceutical
leaders whose poor performance has restrained the Footsie Index in recent
months.

FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD two-way business was reported in the futures market yesterday as the
September contract fought hard against profit-taking to end the session
lower, writes Chris Price.
After Wednesday's powerful surge, which saw the future reach a record high,
the first hour's trading was directionless.
However, buyers soon decided to test the market range again and the slow
rise in September started to gather momentum. It hit 3,030 in the late
morning, which turned out to be the high of the day.
The unemployment statistics and manufacturing output figures had little
impact and a weaker gilts market saw sellers move in and a gradual decline
in the contract began. A softer opening on Wall Street in the afternoon
session also undermined support.
September closed at 3,016, around three points premium to its fair value
level of three. Volume was a healthy 13,000 contracts.
British Gas was again prominent in the traded options market, heading the
list of stocks. It traded 2,727 contracts and was followed by British Steel
on 1,200, Barclays on 822 and Rolls-Royce with 773.
The total of 30,000 contracts compared well with the previous session's
figure which was boosted by the last expiry date.
FT-SE volume was over 8,000, while the Euro-FTSE was half that amount.

FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building materials group Redland was the FT-SE 100's second best performer
after Standard Chartered, the shares rising 23, or 4.3 per cent, to close at
553p, their highest point since May last year when the building sector was
said to have been reflecting a false dawn on the economic recovery in the
UK.
The rise in the Redland share price followed news of a sharp increase in
housing starts in Germany and news that BZW had increased its profits
forecasts for the group.
The broker said it had lifted its current year earnings estimate from Pounds
246m to Pounds 255m and that for next year from Pounds 265m to Pounds 287m,
to reflect the extent of economic recovery in the UK and the US. The shares
also responded, according to dealers, to news that housing starts in Germany
rose by 17 1/2 per cent with housing starts in eastern Germany up a massive
90 per cent. Redland's near-6 per cent yield was another strong bull point
it was said.
Profit-taking and marginal disappointment with the interim results left
Royal Insurance one of the FT-SE 100's worst performers and finally 11 off
at 333p, after 327p.
Water shares spearheaded a general advance by the utilities areas of the
market, with the big institutions said to be hunting top quality, high
yielding stocks following evidence that the recovery in the UK economy is
faltering.
The biggest gains in the water sector came in the less widely traded stocks,
such as Welsh Water, 20 higher at 605p, South West, 17 better at 532p, and
Southern, 14 to the good at 539p. Severn Trent was the pick of the FT-Se 100
constituents, rising 13 to 511p.
The Scottish generators continued to attract keen interest from income funds
ahead of the stocks going ex-dividend on Monday. Hydro settled 8 1/2 up at
371p and Power 10 firmer at 356p.
Berkeley, the housebuilding group, was one of the outstanding performers in
a generally strong building sector. The shares closed 7 up at 433p - their
highest level since July 1987 - following a strong buy recommendation from
Nikko Securities whose building analyst Mr Mark Hake described the stock as
a 'unique investment opportunity'. Mr Hake said that Berkeley's focus on
relatively small sites means that it is able to avoid the worst of the
upward pressures on land prices since the land it acquires does not appeal
to most of its quoted rivals.
Nikko also adopted a bullish stance on Marley, the building materials group
due to announce interims on August 18. The broker recently upgraded its 1993
and 1994 estimates for Marley and forecasts interim profits of Pounds 12m
for the group.
RMC came in for good support, on the back of Redland, the shares adding 6 at
818p.
News of the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Pilkington's Triplex Safety Glass
subsidiary to Nippon Sheet Glass for Pounds 13.3m was viewed as good news by
building sector specialists who said the move proved that Pilkington is seen
as serious in getting its debt burden down. Pilkington shares settled 5
higher at 149p on good turnover of 3.2m with the warrants 3 1/2 to the good
at 50p.
Crest Nicholson's success in letting over 80,000 square feet of office
accommodation at its Farnborough and Maidenhead developments triggered a
surge of demand for the shares which responded with an 8 1/2 advance to 71
1/2 p, their best level since July 1991.
A stock shortage drove Persimmon 11 higher to 292p while the recent buy
recommendation from one of the markets leading agency brokers boosted Wilson
Bowden 5 more to 439p.
Among food manufacturing stocks, investors sought out those stocks with
attractive yields. Booker advanced 6 to 443p, Dalgety 7 to 495p - both
stocks being recommended by Kleinwort Benson yesterday - and Hillsdown 7 to
162p. Unilever rose 11 to 976p ahead of results today. The market range is
between Pounds 546m and Pounds 570m.
In the publishing sector, Mirror Group Newspapers went up 9 to an all-time
high of 168p before retreating to 167p with a net gain of 8 on a turnover of
2.8m shares. SG Warburg made a strong buy recommendation on the group's
prospects of both revenue rise and cost fall and a healthy figure from an
Audit Bureau Circulation survey of national newspapers circulation, due next
week.
Hoare Govett also believed the stock was undervalued and was recovering from
the price war started in mid July among national tabloids which in turn
caused the stock to under-perform the market over the past weeks.
Reed International, the international publishing group which merged with
Elsevier of Holland early this year, eased another 9 to 661p following the
weakness of Elsevier listed in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries of a stock overhang at Thorn EMI, following the company's decision
to redeem a preference share issue early, sent the shares falling sharply.
Leisure analysts said that the move could lead to a stock overhang since
many preference holders were unlikely to want to hold on to their converted
ordinary shares. At worst, this would mean over 11m Thorn shares coming on
to the market over the next few weeks. The stock tumbled 31 to 931p on the
announcement.
There was also other potentially bad news for Thorn yesterday. According to
a US trade magazine, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is to launch an
inquiry into the pricing policies of the major record companies in the huge
US second-hand CD market, with the suggestion that the probe could be
extended into the new CD market.
The move follows complaints from retailers of unfair pressure from the
record companies in an attempt to keep the second hand market prices more in
line with those of new CDs. One US music analyst said last night that the
FTC had been hinting at such an inquiry for some time and that an extension
into the brand new market was 'quite likely'. Thorn earns around Dollars
110m in sales from the US.

FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard Chartered volatile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ABRUPT change of heart by marketmakers in Standard Chartered, the UK
banking group, saw the bank's shares stage a remarkable about turn, as
initial disappointment with the bank's interim figures was transformed by
the appearance of no more than a handful of buying orders.
These proved enough to uncover substantial short positions among marketers
which immediately responded by marking the shares sharply higher.
The extent of the rally in Standard shares was breathtaking. News of
slightly disappointing headline profits figure of Pounds 169m, sharply
higher bad debts and slight disappointment with the extent of the dividend
increase, saw dealers chop their opening price for Standard from an
overnight 898p to 875p.
The downside pressure quickly evaporated, however, as analysts returned from
the post-results meeting in buoyant mood, pointing to proposed Far Eastern
listings for Standard shares and to prospects for a rise in share earnings
this year and next. A flurry of buying drove the shares to an all-time high
of 954p around midday. The shares closed a net 51 up at 949p.
Mr Peter Toeman at Hoare Govett said Standard shares 'still look a good
bet', while Mr Nick Dobby at Robert Fleming Securities said 'with a
prospective price earnings ratio for 1994 of 8.3 times in a rapidly growing
part of the world currently much in vogue and dividend cover of nearly five
times, the shares still look cheap'.
Analysts said the chances of a rights issue, with the bank's tier one
capital rising from 4.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent, 'have all but disappeared.
With earnings per share set to rise to around 91p this year and 115p next
year, the bank has excellent dividend growth prospects.' Talk of a possible
takeover bid for the bank was said to have been overplayed. 'With the share
at around 950p and net asset value at 450p a predator would have to write
off a lot of goodwill,' said another banks analyst.

FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides in spite ff good
inflation data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets moved in an opposite direction to bond prices yesterday,
falling sharply in the morning as bonds rallied, then recovering some of
their losses later as bonds reversed course, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.26 at 3,569.09,
well off its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended 1.50 lower at 448.96, while the Amex composite finished down 1.29 at
437.58, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.65 at 717.12. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 279m shares.
Although prices opened higher, stocks were unable to sustain the upward
momentum in spite of a bond market rally which pushed the yield on the
benchmark 30-year issue down to a record 6.389 per cent. The bond market was
reacting to surprisingly good inflation data in the form of the July
producer prices index, which fell 0.2 per cent.
The failure of stocks to follow bonds higher unsettled dealers and
investors. This triggered some profit-taking, and in turn, heavy selling in
the futures markets. The decline in futures set off computerised sell
programs in the underlying cash markets, depressing stocks further.
Equities may have been troubled, too, by news of the meagre 0.1 per cent
rise in July retail sales. Later in the day, bond prices dropped sharply
after a disappointing auction of new 30-year bonds. The bond market's
retreat coincided with a modest recovery in stocks, which bounced back in
the final half-hour.
Healthcare companies rebounded from Wednesday's big losses after the White
House said that a document circulating around Wall Street, which was
reportedly a draft of the Clinton administration's healthcare reform
initiative, was a fake. The pronouncement lifted HMO America Dollars 3 to
Dollars 36, United Healthcare Dollars 4 to Dollars 56 3/4 , and US
Healthcare, which is quoted on the Nasdaq market, Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars
45 1/2 .
Johnson &amp; Johnson rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 as the stock rallied
from losses incurred earlier in the week when the company said it was
eliminating 3,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting programme. Other drug
stocks, however, succumbed to selling.
T2 Medical plunged Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 8 1/2 in volume of 2.3m shares
after the company said that it would restate earnings for the first and
second quarters after irregularities were discovered in the company's
accounts.
Canada
ACCORDING to preliminary data, the Toronto TSE-300 index fell 6.92 points,
or 0.17 per cent, to close at 4,008.97. Declines outnumbered advances 362 to
332. Volume was 52.130m shares, down from 66.431m, and trading value fell to
CDollars 587.5m.

deal. The 37-share IPC index closed down 31.21 points or 1.72 per cent, at
1,778.89.

FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UBS delights Swiss bank
supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLIGHTS of the day included reaction to the UBS results in Switzerland
and the consolidation of overnight gains in Germany, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH powered ahead after UBS unveiled a net profit rise of 89 per cent,
confounding even the most optimistic estimates of around 50 per cent. The
SMI index rose 39.3 or 1.6 per cent at to an all-time high of 2,450.0, amid
broadly based buying by domestic and foreign investors.
UBS added SFr22 to SFr1,221 after a record intra-day high of SFr1,235 and
the upbeat mood spilled over to the other banks which are also due to report
soon. SBC rose SFr14 to SFr478 and CS Holding was SF80 ahead at SFr2,860.
Among industrials, Sandoz registered shares added SFr115 to SFr3,165 as the
group confirmed that it was expecting a stronger second half performance.
FRANKFURT incorporated Wednesday's post-bourse climb to 1,894.63 as the DAX
index broke 1,900 to close 39.15, or 2.1 per cent higher at 1,904.95. It
appeared to be going for a repeat performance yesterday afternoon as the the
Ibis-indicated DAX approached 1,920, although it subsided later to 1,908.76.
Turnover jumped from DM8.4bn to DM12.2bn. Mr James Cornish at NatWest
Securities said that any time the market has faltered recently, American
buyers have come in - compensating for potential currency losses on the
rising dollar by buying dollar-sensitive, German exporters.
One of Germany's super-sensitive stocks, Volkswagen, showed the American
effect yesterday, rising DM15 to DM384.50 over the official session, and as
high as DM399, 8 per cent up on the day in the post-bourse before easing to
DM393. Other cyclical exporters like Daimler, engineers and steels showed up
well, Thyssen in particular climbing DM12.50 to DM218.
Mr Nigel Longley, at Commerzbank, said that UK and, later, US buying
yesterday left domestic traders effectively short. 'They didn't have the
shares to cope with US afternoon demand,' he said.
MILAN held up firmly for much of the session but some late profit-taking
left shares off their best levels and the Comit index finished just 2.18
better, at a high for the year of 590.96.
Ferruzzi and Montedison resumed trading after their two-day suspension.
Analysts believed that short covering helped Ferruzzi to recoup a large part
of its early losses to finish L120 or 28.6 per cent lower at L299. The
shares were marked 75 per cent down at L101 in early trading.
Montedison fell 20 per cent at the opening, but finished L59.5, or 7.7 per
cent lower at L710, its announcement of an increase in first-half operating
profit giving support.
Olivetti, L56 higher at L2,115 and its parent, Cir, L70 higher at L1,700,
were unable to maintain their best levels of the day. Both had gained
strongly in recent days on renewed rumours that DEC of the US might want an
increased Olivetti stake.
AMSTERDAM continued its record breaking run, but closed below its best in
busy, volatile trading. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.3 to 128.40.
KLM set an intra-day high for the year of Fl 38.90 after reporting a small
rise in first quarter net profit. But profit-taking trimmed the gain to Fl
1.00 at Fl 37.60. Fokker closed Fl 1.70 firmer at Fl 23.00 on news of a US
order. Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium group, closed Fl 1.20 lower at Fl
50.10 after a wave of profit-taking which pushed it to a low of Fl 47.10.
Continuing demand for cyclicals pushed Akzo, the chemical group, up Fl 3.40
to Fl 173.90 and KNP BT, the paper maker, Fl 1.30 higher to Fl 38.90.
PARIS ended weaker after setting a record intra-day high, dealers blaming
profit-taking as the CAC-40 index closed 5.52 lower at 2,161.87 after an
earlier peak of 2,179.04. Turnover stayed high at FFr5.6bn.
Michelin, one of the week's strong performers, lost FFr3.70 at FFr195.50.
Gains remained in laggards like Club Mediterranee and Eurodisney, up FFr18
to FFr447.90, and FFr2.40 to FFr65.50 respectively.
MADRID set a new 1993 high, the general index closing 4.30, or 1.6 per cent
higher at 278.48 as turnover rose from Pta20.7bn to Pta25.4bn.
In banks, Banesto extended Wednesday's climb on its funding successes,
rising Pta325 to Pta3,000 for a two-day gain of 12.9 per cent; this time it
was followed by Argentaria, Pta200 higher at Pta5,950.
STOCKHOLM rallied after the central bank lowered its key interest rate by 25
basis points to 8.0 per cent. The Affarsvarlden index rose 26.8, or 2.1 per
cent to a year's high of 1,287.1.
COPENHAGEN climbed in lively trading with exporters benefiting from the
lower krone and the KFX index rose 1.49 to 96.18. Novo Nordisk slipped DKr2
to DKr545 as foreign investors took profits.
OSLO soared 3 per cent in record volume as hopes built up for lower interest
rates. The all-share index jumped 16.96 to 580.59 turnover of NKr1.14bn.
BRUSSELS turned its attention to industrial stocks, and the market closed
sharply higher but off morning record levels after some profits were taken.
The Bel-20 index rose 15.83 or 1.2 per cent to 1,365.70 in turnover of
BFr1.9bn.

FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand helps
fuel Nikkei advance
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE buying by foreign investors boosted volume, and share prices gained
marginal ground on purchases of large-capital and telecommunications-related
issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 32.71 to 20,765.28, rising for the fourth
consecutive day. It saw a day's high of 20,939.39 in early trading, but
profit-taking brought it to a low of 20,708.47 in the afternoon.
Volume jumped from 379m to 500m shares, its highest since June 11. Traders
noted heavy buying by US mutual funds, shifting capital from US treasury
bonds. Winners led losers by 665 to 314 with 183 unchanged, the Topix index
of all first section stocks rose 5.95 to 1,686.18 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.44 to 1,283.74.
A rise in overseas stock markets supported sentiment; conversely, the
continued strength of the yen prompted some foreign investors to take
profits. The dollar closed down Y0.40 at Y103.37, falling to a record low of
Y103.20 in the afternoon.
Some market participants were encouraged by the large number of bids
accepted for the state owned East Japan Railway share auction. The JNR
Settlement received a total of 18,670 bids, 14,508 from individuals and
4,162 from corporations. Successful bidders will be selected on August 26,
with the public offering priced fixed on August 30.
Nippon Steel, the most active issue, rose Y13 to Y383 on buying by overseas
investors.
Exporters were hurt, and energy-related issues lifted by the higher yen.
Matsushita Electric Industrial fell Y30 to Y1,370, Sony by Y60 to Y4,370 and
Toyota Motor by Y40 to Y1,610; but Tokyo Electric Power rose Y70 to Y3,820
and Cosmo Oil by Y27 to Y927.
Continued hopes of a housing tax cut buoyed related stocks. Misawa Homes
gained Y40 to Y1,240, Daiwa House Y20 to Y1,680 and Mitsubishi Estate Y10 to
Y1,100.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 136.66 to 22,762.22 in volume of 76.5m
shares. Traders said that volume rose as investors realised profits ahead of
the September book closing. Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets turned in mostly positive performances. Bangkok was
closed for a public holiday.
AUSTRALIA soared to a fresh post-1987 crash high after Channel Seven's debut
boosted sentiment. The All Ordinaries index closed up 12.3 at 1,873.3.
Channel Seven closed at ADollars 2.73 after listing at a 65 cent premium to
the ADollars 2.00 issue price in volume of 16.9m.
BOMBAY was sharply higher, in spite of stepping back from the day's best
levels after mid-session profit-taking. The BSE index added 109.83 at
2,490.79.
TAIWAN moved ahead after a wave of late buying, with the mood remaining
positive ahead of the ruling Nationalist Party's congress next week.
The weighted index wavered narrowly all session before ending 25.71 points
up at 4,140.75. Turnover was a moderate TDollars 17bn after Wednesday's
TDollars 26.62bn.
NEW ZEALAND closed firmer, following strength on overseas bourses and to a
partial bounce in Telecom. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 5.41 higher at
1,888.82, but off its intraday high of 1,899.55.
Telecom firmed 6 cents to NZDollars 4.04 after a day's high of Dollars 4.08.
MANILA moved ahead as local investors turned their attention to selected
blue chip issues after taking profits on the newly-listed JG Summit. The
market index rose 4.01 to 1,751.68.
PLDT and Philippine National Bank each rose 10 pesos to 1,105 pesos and
337.50 pesos while JG Summit finished at 7 pesos, up from Wednesday's 6.80
pesos.
HONG KONG had a listless day with second line China-related stocks
continuing to dominate dealings amid a lull among blue chips. The Hang Seng
index was 18.08 lower at 7,339.55 after opening up 54 points on London and
New York's record highs overnight.

FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland's hopes stay high after
phenomenal gains - Helsinki's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask Finnish analysts whether the Helsinki stock market can continue its
phenomenal performance and they will probably answer in the affirmative. Far
from being overbought, they will say, many shares still look cheap on
international comparisons and the fundamentals are still strong enough to
ensure that any setbacks are only temporary.
The Hex index closed another 40.2 higher yesterday at a new high of 1,426.0,
72 per cent up this year and comfortably more than double its 541 level on
September 7 last year. Its upward momentum is being fuelled by falling
interest rates - the Bank of Finland yesterday announced a half percentage
point cut in base rates to 6.0 per cent - and the rapidly improving position
of the country's leading exporters following the sharp depreciation of the
markka in the last two years.
In addition, there has been heavy foreign buying following the relaxation of
restrictions on foreign share ownership at the start of the year. The belief
that the market has further to go stems from expectations of yet lower
interest rates, hopes for a gradual recovery in the Finnish economy, and a
belief that the earnings of leading Finnish exporters will improve strongly
in 1994 and 1995.
Mr Kim Lindstrom, managing director of UBF Fund Management Ltd, believes
that the Hex index will exceed its all-time high of 2,009, which it struck
in April 1989, either next year or in 1995.
Mr Esko Haavisto, head of investment research at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki,
though slightly more cautious, still expects the upward trend to hold firm.
He believes that domestic investors were wrong-footed by a more than usually
active summer trading session (shares rose by 10.7 per cent in July alone)
and that they have returned from their holidays in a buying mood.
The continued rise in the index is the more extraordinary because of bleak
conditions in the domestic economy. A recent forecast suggests that the
Finnish economy will shrink 2 per cent this year, the third consecutive year
of decline, and grow only slightly in 1994. But this only underlines the
ambivalent nature of the Helsinki stock exchange, which is dominated by
large exporting groups and has comparatively few companies, such as
construction groups, which are exposed to the domestic situation.
Undoubtedly, some of the buying has had a speculative flavour to it, none
more so than in the banking sector, which has risen by around 150 per cent
this year in the face of the country's continued financial sector crisis.
The downside risks are all too obvious, given that many of the country's
main banks may not be back in profit until 1996.
More generally, the market remains subject to nervousness about developments
in its eastern neighbour, Russia. And there are fears about squabbles on the
political front at home - either because the government is unable to agree
its budget in the current environment of austerity or because this autumn's
wage round proves difficult. There are fears that workers will demand big
pay rises because of the improving performance of the export companies, but
the ability of domestically-orientated groups to increase wages is almost
non-existent.
A final factor which could unsettle the market is evidence that corporate
profits are not improving as much as expected, given that analysts are
already valuing companies on their prospects in 1994 and 1995.
KOP Investment Research, for example, is expecting net profits of Finnish
companies (excluding banks) to rebound to a FM911m surplus this year from a
FM6.65bn loss last year, before moving ahead to a FM5.83bn profit next year.
This could prove a tall order in the current international recession, at a
time of more volatile currency movements, notwithstanding a 23 per cent rise
in Finland's first half exports.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Reserves push down franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc and Danish krone came under renewed pressure in the
reformed exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers took the view that the
currencies could not be sustained much longer by high interest rates, writes
James Blitz.
Both countries have kept liquidity tight in their money markets to preserve
their currencies' parities with the D-Mark. But the lack of foreign exchange
reserves in their central banks highlighted the weakness in the high
interest rate policy.
In its reserve figures for the week to August 5, the Bank of France revealed
that it probably has a large deficit following intervention to support the
French franc earlier this month.
Mr Robin Marshall of Chase Manhattan Bank has calculated that the Bank of
France has a net debt of FFr350bn and that, even if it were to liquidate all
its gold and ecu holdings, it would still be FFr30bn 'in the red'.
Mr Marshall's assessment is among the more pessimistic. But the news on the
reserves forced the French franc down to a low of FFr3.52 yesterday. It
later closed at FFr3.514 to the D-Mark, about a third of a centime down on
the day.
The Danes may also have few reserves in their central bank because they
announced a bond issue worth SFr1bn yesterday, in addition to the Pounds
1.2bn in sterling last week.
But the krone also fell back yesterday, falling from about DKr3.406 to the
D-Mark to a London close of DKr4.1135. It was striking yesterday that the
Danish krone was 6.98 percentage points lower than the Dutch guilder in the
ERM grid, compared to the 2.25 percentage points of fluctuation permitted
before the ERM reform.
The ERM aside, the main focus in currency markets was on the Japanese yen,
which again thrust upwards to another post-war high of Y103.00 against the
dollar. It later closed in London at Y103.15, down from a previous close of
Y103.70.
The Bank of Japan intervened substantially to support the currency, with
some dealers suggesting that several billion dollars were bought in attempts
to push the currency down. The Bank also called for concerted G-7
intervention on the dollar/yen exchange rate, but there was no comment at
all on the issue from US officials.
The dollar, however, was somewhat stronger against the D-Mark, closing at
DM1.7200 from a previous DM1.7180. Dealers said that a modest 0.1 percentage
point rise in US retail sales in July had little impact on the currency.
Sterling weakened by 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday in the wake
of poorer than expected figures for manufacturing output and unemployment in
the UK. There are expectations that the British government will cut interest
rates, but this was not reflected in money markets. The pound closed at
DM2.5175.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Speculation on UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations of a cut in UK base rates remained fairly strong yesterday
after a small increase in unemployment in July and a slight drop in
manufacturing output in June, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's unemployment figures showed the first net monthly rise for six
months. At the same time, a 2.1 per cent drop in manufacturing output in
June more than offset the 1.5 per cent rise the month before.
One sterling money market dealer said that the figures had triggered a new
round of speculation that UK base rates would be cut, with a few market
operators even wondering whether monetary policy might even be eased today.
However, another dealer dismissed this idea: 'You have to ask yourself
whether there is any political rationale behind such a cut, and right now,
there isn't,' he said.
The September and December short sterling contracts remained strongly
bullish for a cut, although they did not alter much during the day. The
September contract was up 2 basis points at 94.29 at the close, while the
December contract fell 2 basis points on the day to close at 94.73.
Sterling cash markets were more-or-less unchanged. Three month money dipped
slightly from 5.78 per cent to 5.75 per cent on the bid side. There was a
shortage of Pounds 1.1bn in the discount market, and only Pounds 30m of late
assistance.
European markets were very quiet, although another poor set of reserves
figures from the Bank of France led some dealers to think that interest
rates would only come slowly there.
The September French franc contract was up 4 basis points on the day at
93.42, quite a modest performance in the wake of the previous day's heavy
buying.
In the cash market, 3 month French francs closed about 20 basis points
higher on the day at 7.95 per cent as the franc came under heavy pressure in
the wake of the reserves figures. German call money eased yesterday after
the Bundesbank had surprised the market on Wednesday by adding a net
DM10.3bn to the banking system.
Call money hovered around 6.75 per cent after 6.80 per cent the previous
day. Some dealers said the high levels of liquidity had left the market in a
good position to meet a season of tax payments which should start next week.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price drops below Dollars
370
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE dropped below Dollars 370 a troy ounce in late London trading
yesterday in very nervous market conditions.
Selling by some of the same US investment funds that helped drive the price
above Dollars 400 an ounce less than two weeks ago had been responsible for
gold's steady slide since Monday, traders suggested.
Funds started selling again yesterday after publication of US economic data
showing inflation was firmly under control, some dealers said. Nervousness
was also compounded by rumours, not widely believed, that a European central
bank was selling gold.
Others attributed the US funds' decision to move out of gold to calmer
conditions in world currency markets.
Gold closed in London at Dollars 373.50, down Dollars 1.75 an ounce. But
late trading took the full impact of the fund activity and the price dropped
to Dollars 364.85 an ounce at one point last night.
One dealer suggested there was 'very solid support' for the price at Dollars
360. He expected gold to be very volatile in the next few weeks, with price
swings of Dollars 10-Dollars 15 an ounce likely, until physical demand
picked up in September.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks over Azerbaijan oil
return to square one

<TEXT>
SEVEN WEEKS after a coup undid a groundbreaking oil deal just before it was
to be signed, western companies have resumed negotiations from scratch with
the Caspian Sea republic of Azerbaijan.
In meetings that began this week, the new Azeri government is reportedly
talking tougher - sometimes with barely concealed hostility - than did the
negotiating team of the toppled president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey. According to
western oil officials in the Azeri capital, the government has a range of
demands, including that Azerbaijan receives up to 80 per cent of the profits
from its estimated 4bn barrels of oil reserves.
The government, now headed by a Brezhnev-era leader, Mr Heidar Aliyev, has
also refused to refund Dollars 70m in signing bonuses that eight western
companies advanced just a day before the government's suspension of the deal
on June 23. The deal was supposed to be signed at the end of June in London,
but it fell through when Mr Elchibey, under pressure from a rebel colonel,
fled on June 18. That colonel, Mr Surat Husseinov, is now the Azeri prime
minister.
None of the eight companies has backed out of the negotiations, though they
have spent this week with the frustrating task of explaining the basics of
the complex deal to a mostly fresh Azeri team.
The companies, some of whom have been negotiating with various Azeri
governments for two years, are staying tight-lipped about the new talks,
fearful of saying anything publicly that could kill the deal.
'They have their expectations, and we have our expectations. We'll just have
to see how it comes out in the end,' one of the oil officials said.
Mr Aliyev has taken a leading role in the new discussions. He has forced the
resignation of the state oil chief, Mr Sabit Bagirov, whom western oil
officials respected as a fair, apolitical technocrat. Mr Bagirov was
replaced by a little-known geologist, Mr Natik Aliyev, who is not related to
the Azeri president. Mr Aliyev then transferred the geologist's
decision-making powers to parliament, which the Azeri leader heads.
At a public meeting on Monday, Mr Aliyev made most of the oil officials
believe that a deal would go through but he did not make clear what ultimate
terms he was seeking.
The companies are pushing for what they call a 'unitised' approach to
developing Azerbaijan's three oilfields, something that had already been
agreed upon by Mr Elchibey. The companies would take percentages of the deal
and develop the three fields together as a consortium.
In addition, the companies are discussing the construction of a Dollars 1.4
bn pipeline to carry 800,000 barrels of oil a day to the west. Under the
leading plan, the pipeline would travel through Iran and Armenia before
reaching Erzurum, Turkey, and connecting with an existing Iraqi pipeline
that has been dry since the Gulf war.
The companies are British Petroleum, Statoil, Amaco, Pennzoil, Union Oil of
California, McDermott International, Ramco Energy and the Turkish Petroleum
Company.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wider EC trade area would mean
CAP rethink, study says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT EVENTS pointing to further integration of eastern Europe with the
European Community have unleashed forces that eventually will lower world
farm commodity prices and force a restructuring of the Common Agriculture
Policy, according to a study by three US farm economists.
The study says the changes would be neutral to the US in net welfare terms,
with farm exporters' losses more than matched by gains to consumers through
lower food prices.
According to the study by Mr James Gleckler, Mr Robert Koopman and Mr Luther
Tweeten, full integration into the EC of the European Free Trade Area
countries and the eastern European states of Hungary, Poland, the Czech and
Slovak Republics, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania,
would lift the cost to the EC budget of the nine main commodities regulated
by the CAP to Dollars 4.7bn at the end of the century from Dollars 3.6bn in
1989.
At the same time, world prices for course grains would fall by almost 18 per
cent, with beef, maize and sugar prices falling by 8-9 per cent. Only pork
prices would rise - by about 2 per cent.
'Because many of the eastern regions are impoverished and eligible for
special assistance in addition to that for commodities, full integration
would greatly expand CAP budget requirements,' the study says. 'The burden
of financing CAP for an agriculture sector roughly twice the size of the
present EC would fall squarely on the shoulders of the original 12 members.
'The Community, already facing crisis in financing agricultural programmes,
could need to restructure the CAP. Lower price supports, production
controls, and a shift to direct payments are possible reforms.'
European integration would cost US farmers about Dollars 2.2bn a year by the
end of the century, with maize and beef producers losing most. But gains
from lower food prices would amount to more than Dollars 2.3bn.
A farm trade official in London said yesterday that there had been no formal
studies in the EC of the likely cost to the CAP of European integration.
'(The costs) could be massive, but since this is not going to happen before
the end of the century, it depends on so many incalculable assumptions that
predictions are meaningless,' he said.
In Brussels, an EC farm official said a preliminary study was being carried
out at Kiel University in Germany that suggested the cost impact of
integration 'would not be as important as these American academics claim'.

<TEXT>
THE PRICE of raw materials in China shot up by almost 45 per cent in the
first half, thanks to rapid economic growth, widespread speculation and the
continuing construction boom, the official press reported.
China's Economic Daily said prices of the 16 main industrial raw materials,
including steel, timber, rubber, cement and chemicals, rose an average
year-on-year 44.7 per cent.
Domestic production rose by 13.7 per cent and domestic consumption by 16.2
per cent, while imports leapt 143 per cent. The newspaper put the steep
price rises down to rapid economic growth and to the state's 70.7 per cent
increase in fixed asset investment during that period.
The price increase rose on a year-on-year basis from 31.2 per cent in
January to 52.9 per cent in June.
Steel product prices rose by 73 per cent in the first half, while
consumption rose 33.9 per cent, and production 21.2 per cent. Imports of
steel products more than tripled to 11.16m tonnes.
The paper said fear of further price rises was leading to widespread
speculative buying. The price rises did not reflect actual supply and
demand.

THE WORST drought in more than 50 years in Brazil's northeast has brought
heavy losses to the region's sugar cane crop and industry officials predict
declines of up to 45 per cent, Reuter reports from Maceio.
The northeast accounts for most of the country's sugar exports and many
officials said it would not be able to fulfil export quotas.
Mr Jose Carlos Maranhao, commercial director at the Santo Antonio sugar
refinery in Maceio, the capital of Alagoas, said the state's 1993-94 cane
crop would fall 33 per cent to 14m tonnes. Pernambuco, the regions' other
sugar state, has also been affected.

The London Metal Exchange COPPER market continued to be supported yesterday
by technical tightness, which showed no sign of easing. The cash position
reversed the week's downtrend to close Dollars 17.50 higher at Dollars 1,942
a tonne, while three months delivery metal was up Dollars 5 at Dollars
1,897.50 a tonne. In the ALUMINIUM market the decline of the previous few
days was arrested in the afternoon and the three months position closed
Dollars 4.75 up at Dollars 1,199.50 a tonne. Dealers said the upturn was in
response to a US option enquiry that caused some to speculate that a North
American production cut might be in the offing. Solid support prevented the
NICKEL market from extending an early fall to fresh six-year lows. The three
months price steadied to close at Dollars 4,825 a tonne, still Dollars 56.50
down on the day, and moved up to Dollars 4,830 in kerb trading. At the
London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures closed with small gains, boosted
primarily by the weakness of sterling against the dollar. Dealers said the
medium-term outlook appeared constructive, aided by expectations of another
deficit in 1993-94.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper market responds to
'rogue' element
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUGE WEIGHT of money available to market operators is having an
increasing impact on the London Metal Exchange's flagship copper market,
according to Mr Martin Thompson, commercial adviser at the RTZ Corporation,
the world's biggest mining company.
'Like any free market, that for copper has always been open to a wide
variety of 'technical' influences that do not necessarily reflect its
fundamentals,' Mr Thompson says. 'But in recent years the price's behaviour
has tended to become increasingly divorced from the perceived levels of
physical supply and demand.'
Mr Thompson suggests the main cause is that the growth of the copper market,
which is restricted to the growth in copper consumption, 'has fallen far
behind the growth in the finance available to some market operators, whose
capacity to influence the behaviour of the price has grown accordingly'.
'Restriction on the supply of metal - attributed to a Japanese company  -
did much to support copper's price in 1991. Heavy buying by Chinese
companies, well beyond their physical purchases, performed the same service
in 1992 and early this year. Operations by American commodity funds have
also been influential from time to time,' he explains. 'In addition, the
volume of options now sold is such that covering by their sellers, by both
buying and selling, has become a major 'rogue' element (in the market).'
Mr Thompson's analysis appears in the latest annual reviews from Mining
Journal and was written before the latest technical squeeze - and
accompanying allegations of manipulation - took hold of the copper market.
Mr Chris Green, a former chairman of the LME and a director of Barclays
Metals, also suggests in the annual reviews that option activity on the
exchange is playing a significant role in keeping copper prices up.
He says that as much as 15-20 per cent of all 1993 copper mine production
has been covered by options in one form or another. A number of producers
have already bought similar protection against 1994 output.
The difficulty for the granters of the options, 'on whose shoulders the
burden of risk management now lies', is that there has been in copper little
opportunity to offset the risk of options granted to producers against
business with consumers, Mr Green says.
'This latter group, which comprises major motor vehicle manufacturers, the
larger domestic appliance manufacturers and the big electrical combines,
have been singularly, but understandably, reticent to enter into similar
deals the other way round.
'There is no history in copper, unlike the aluminium industry, of producers
being willing to guarantee their customers fixed prices for years ahead.
'Such is the gap between the expectations of (copper) consumers and those of
producers that the development of 'two-way' option business has been
relatively small.'
Mr Green explains that official LME options, while giving transparency and
liquidity to the market, in normal circumstances are all restricted to the
third Wednesday of each month and must be declared two weeks prior. So,
while the market is highly active, it can also at times be 'seriously
illiquid'.
He says additional warehouse locations for copper in other key industrial
areas would help ease the position by making physical metal more easily
obtainable. (This is a hint that Mr Green would support any LME move to
appoint warehouses to store copper in the US, which so far it has been
reluctant to do.)
Meanwhile, 'the rigidity of the system remains a target for manipulation,
which can in turn generate a stampede in the marketplace'. And this was what
happened in earlier this year when such a 'stampede' caused the copper price
to fall by one-quarter in five weeks to reach Dollars 1,710 a tonne in May,
its lowest level for 5 1/2 years.
Mining Journal's two annual reviews provide detailed overviews of the
industry, covering 155 countries alphabetically from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe
and 64 metals and minerals from aluminium to zirconium.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Exciting bull market' forecast
for cocoa as stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COCOA market appears to be heading for 'the most exciting bull market
for some time', according to GNI, the London trade house.
As continuing supply deficits bring further reductions in world stocks a
rerun of the massive bull market of the 1970s 'is not out of the question',
GNI says in its latest Cocoa Outlook report.
That would suggest a surge from an average price of Pounds 745 a tonne this
year to Pounds 1,600 a tonne in 1994 and Pounds 2,700 a tonne in 1995.
'Ultimately the rally should peter out close to the July 1977 second
(futures) position high of Pounds 3,512 a tonne in 1995,' the report says.
In reaching this conclusion GNI takes as its starting point a reassessment
of supply in the 1992-93 season. The Ivory Coast, the biggest cocoa
producer, has banned mid-crop exports, which account for 150,000 tonnes out
of the country's total production of 750,000 tonnes. As a result, GNI says,
while the global production deficit for the year is only about 100,000
tonnes, the supply deficit is about 244,000 tonnes.
The report admits that much of the Ivorian mid-crop will be carried over
into 1993-94, but suggests that about a third will be lost because of poor
storage conditions in the villages. Thus the 1993-94 main crop is likely to
be swollen by only about 100,000 tonnes. And as the Ivorians plan to
continue the embargo on mid-crop sales another 50,000 tonnes is likely to be
lost to the world market next season.
With Indonesia the only big producer whose output is increasing, global
supply is therefore expected to increase only marginally in 1993-94. So,
assuming continued steady growth in consumption, GNI forecasts a further
significant supply deficit of 241,000 tonnes.
Other significant factors taken into account in the report include signs
that yields in the three big African producing countries - the Ivory Coast,
Nigeria and Ghana - could be 'significantly below par next year', while
Malaysia's planted area is expected to contract as growers switch to more
profitable crops.
GNI calculates that world stocks of cocoa should fall below the
psychologically important 1m-tonne mark to 918,000 tonnes by the end of the
1993-94 season 'even without any significant problems'. That would represent
about 36 per cent of annual consumption. By the end of the 1994-95 season,
the report suggests, that figure will have fallen below 30 per cent, 'which
is normally regarded as critical'.
On the question of the disposal of the International Cocoa Organisation
buffer stock of 230,000 tonnes, GNI says it is reasonable to assume that
this will be done in an orderly fashion - probably at a rate of 46,000
tonnes in each of the five years of the ICCO's new economic agreement.
'The buffer stock could then be regarded as an independent supplier with
fixed five-year production horizon,' the report says. 'Indeed it would then
be valid to erase the 230,000 tonnes from the global stock figure, giving a
stock to consumption ratio of just 27 per cent at the end of 1993-94 - well
below the critical 30 per cent barrier.'
All this adds up to an 'unequivocally bullish' outlook for the cocoa price,
GNI says. 'It is surprising that the price has not moved higher this year.'

FT  13 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Pressure on sterling hits gilts during
heavy profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond prices were volatile yesterday, as some markets came under
selling pressure from profit-takers, while others proved susceptible to
movements in the foreign exchange market.
Dealers said most markets had been ready for a correction after advancing
strongly recently. According to Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at SG Warburg,
10-year bond yields have fallen 40 basis points in Germany, 47 in France, 56
in the UK, and 136 in Italy since the beginning of July.
GILTS proved particularly turbulent as sterling came under pressure
following the release of a disappointing batch of economic data which showed
that manufacturing output fell 2.1 per cent in June and unemployment rose
for the first time since January.
The gilt future on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options
Exchange (Liffe) opened half a point higher and rose to 113 1/2 before
declining rapidly. However, after hitting a low of 11 25/32 , it recovered
to end at 112 3/8 , more than a point down on the opening. Dealers said
there was technical support for the future at this level.
They said the declines were partly due to heavy profit-taking by domestic
institutions. The market has rallied strongly recently, advancing from 108
1/2 two weeks ago and 110 5/8 a week ago.
'The main risk to the gilts market is that overseas demand will dry up,'
said Mr Jonathon Davies, an analyst at UBS. Consequently, the weakness of
sterling is of concern, as foreign investors tend to buy gilts when they are
bullish on the currency as well as the bond market.
However, the Bank of England sold its latest gilt taps without apparent
difficulty.
FRENCH bond prices ended up about  1/4 point, while the French notional bond
future on the Matif in Paris closed at 122.82, up 0.18 point.
The market had reached a high of 122.88, close to its psychological target
of 123.00. However, once the future breaks through that level, it could lose
some of its impetus, analysts said.
It was announced that France's July provisional consumer price index rose a
seasonally-adjusted 0.1 per cent, to 0.2 per cent on the month. This was a
benign number for the market as tax changes had made little impact.
However, inflation is not the current worry for the French market: of more
concern was the pressure on the franc, and fears the government might see
any currency weakness as a reason to delay rate cuts.
The market was hoping for little fresh encouragement from an address by
prime minister Edouard Balladur on French television last night.
'The general stance seems to be to talk tough and ease rates quietly,' one
analyst said.
AFTER rallying strongly in the morning on surprisingly good inflation
figures, US bond prices dropped into negative territory later in the day
following a disappointing auction of 30-year bonds.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 109
(a swing of almost  3/4 of a point from the morning's high), yielding 6.438
per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 11/32 , to
yield 4.049 per cent.
Longer-dated prices surged after the commerce department announced its index
of producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in July. Analysts had been expecting a
modest increase in the PPI. The 'core' measure of inflation, which excludes
the volatile food and energy components, was also unexpectedly weak,
registering only a 0.1 per cent increase last month.
Even the most bullish of inflation forecasters were surprised by the data,
and there was heavy buying of bonds.
All of the early gains, however, were wiped out when dealers marked down
prices in an attempt to clear their books of the new supply of bonds bought
in the 30-year auction. Demand for the Dollars 11bn in new bonds was
unexpectedly weak, and the issue was sold at an average yield of 6.33 per
cent.
GERMAN bond prices ended virtually unchanged after an unusually volatile
session, when the trading range widened to 40 basis points.
The bund future closed at 97.42, having reached a high of 97.63. However,
the future is now heading into new territory, and it there may be some
resistance to the market breaking through to new highs, without some sign of
action to ease rates.
IN Japan, the yen reached new highs, fuelling speculation that an interest
rate cut was on the way, as the Bank of Japan eased conditions in the money
market.
Bond prices rallied more than half a point, and the benchmark No 145
government bond yield breached the psychological 4 per cent barrier to end
at 3.97 per cent.
ITALIAN bonds again out-performed other markets, as dealers continued to
reassess their views on the market, now widely viewed as having been heavily
oversold.
Dealers said the currency was holding up reasonably well, and more positive
sentiment on the inflation outlook is fuelling foreign interest in the
market. Ten-year Italian bond prices rose a further 3/4 point, but yields
are approaching the 10 per cent level, which could provide resistance.
However, Italy and Spain are now the only mainstream European markets
offering 10-year yields above 8 per cent.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan eases rules on forex
dealing

TAIWAN will allow foreign and local brokers to enter the island's foreign
exchange market, the Central Bank of China (CBC) announced yesterday.
In a move which signals the end of a monopoly on forex brokering by the
non-profitmaking Taipei Foreign Exchange Market Development Foundation, the
island's central bank has issued a set of rules, which took effect on August
11.
A CBC official said the move was partly aimed at attracting overseas
brokerages to the market and so give the island access to worldwide forex
marketing networks.
This, in turn, would help Taiwan's plans to develop into an international
financial centre.
Under the new rules, overseas forex brokers will have to be limited
liability stock companies. They will be able to set up branches in Taiwan
with a minimum capital of TDollars 100m (USDollars 3.7m). Local brokers will
face a similar capital requirement.
Overseas investors will be able to hold up to 50 per cent in Taiwan forex
brokerage houses. The rules also limit local monetary institutions to a
maximum 10 per cent investment in any single brokerage, and a 20 per cent
limit on holdings by other local investors.
The central bank did not plan to impose restrictions on the number of
overseas or Taiwan brokers allowed to enter the market.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark returns with SFr1bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KINGDOM of Denmark yesterday satisfied expectations by launching its
second large bond offering in as many weeks. However, it surprised the
market with its decision to borrow in Swiss francs rather than French
francs.
Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National
Bank, said he had decided on Swiss francs because that currency was
under-represented in the bank's debt portfolio.
However, Mr Sorensen said any further borrowing could well be in French
francs. 'It is likely that we will be borrowing again in the not too distant
future,' he said.
The proceeds from yesterday's SFr1bn six-year offering would be used to
replenish Denmark's depleted foreign exchange reserves. Last week's record
Pounds 1.3bn Eurobond offering by Denmark was for the same purpose.
Mr Sorensen said the bank's foreign exchange reserves had fallen to DKr35bn
at the start of August, from DKr60bn in July. He blamed this on heavy
currency intervention to help restore stability in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
In addition to shoring up its foreign exchange reserves, Denmark's National
Bank plans to use proceeds from future bond issues to replace its
outstanding short-dated debt, which is mainly in the form of commercial
paper.
Yesterday's Swiss franc offering by Denmark rivalled the record for a single
transaction in the Swiss bond market, set by the Republic of Austria at the
end of June.
UBS, the lead manager, said deals of this size took time to absorb. However,
it was confident Denmark's entire issue would be placed before the payment
date on September 30.
Demand for the paper was predominantly from domestic investors. The bonds,
which carry a coupon of 4 1/4 per cent, were quoted at less 1.85 bid, from
an issue price of 101.8, in the afternoon.
UBS also led the other notable deal of the day, arranging a SFr300m
seven-year offering for the World Bank. Although the bonds also carry a
coupon of 4 1/4 per cent, the higher issue price of 102 reflected the
issuer's superior credit rating. The bonds were trading at less 1 5/8 bid in
the afternoon.
Expectations of lower interest rates in Switzerland have increased the
attraction of the Swiss franc sector, and syndicate managers expect more
borrowers to tap this area of the international bond market.
Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Sweden re-opened its successful Ecu500m seven-year
deal, and sold a further Ecu100m. The move was aimed at restoring liquidity
to the issue.
The joint lead manager, Swiss Bank Corporation, said the original amount,
issued on June 2, had been priced to yield 5 basis points over the benchmark
9 1/2 per cent French OAT government bond due 2000.
However, demand from Ecu-denominated funds, central banks and Swiss
investors was such that the bonds were yielding 40 basis points below the
benchmark bond earlier this week. The new tranche was priced to yield 33
basis points below the OAT.
SBC said it did not expect any further Ecu-denominated deals in the near
future because of the lack of swap opportunities.
Meanwhile, the steady stream of German banks tapping the D-Mark sector
continued, as Trinkhaus &amp; Burkhardt, the Dusseldorf-based bank, raised
DM150m through a seven-year offering.
Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating service, said it had lowered
the long-term debt rating for Banco di Napoli, Italy's fifth-largest
commercial bank, to A2 from A1.
About Dollars 750m worth of debt is affected.

with TWA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, yesterday announced a Dollars
64.7m sale-and-leaseback deal with the city of St Louis, in Missouri. News
of the deal came 24 hours after TWA won bankruptcy court approval for its
plan of reorganisation, and was accompanied by confirmation that the airline
plans to move its headquarters to St Louis.
TWA filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
Bankruptcy Code in early 1992, when the airline was still owned by Mr Carl
Icahn, the US financier. Approval for its reorganisation plan means that it
should emerge from bankruptcy within a few weeks.
Under the reorganisation scheme, equity ownership of the airline will be
split between employees, in return for wage concessions, and creditors, in
exchange for forgiving debt.
The carrier had been headquartered in Mount Kisco, New York - alongside Mr
Icahn's other business interests - although its main operating 'hub' was in
St Louis. Under the arrangement with the city, TWA will sell gates, jetways,
baggage systems and associated property to the local airport authority and
then lease these assets back.
Cash from the sale will arrive in two stages: Dollars 24.7m by October 31
and Dollars 40m by December 31. The city has also waived a Dollars 5.3m
claim against TWA for back-lease payments.
TWA dominates air services in St Louis, and when fears about the airline's
continued viability were at their height, concerns were expressed about the
impact which the airline's collapse might have on the city's business
community.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Seven at premium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Seven Network, the Australian TV group, were listed on Australian
stock exchanges yesterday and closed at a premium on the issue price of over
35 per cent.
The shares, which were issued at ADollars 2, closed at ADollars 2.73 on
turnover of more than 16m after the ADollars 600m (USDollars 410m) float was
heavily oversubscribed and closed early.
It was the second large Australian flotation in as many months to be
overwhelmed by investors, with the ADollars 2.45bn Woolworths offer drawing
subscriptions of more than ADollars 6bn.
Major beneficiaries of Seven's strong debut are the company's two major
shareholders, News Corporation, the Australian media group, with 15 per
cent, and Telecom, the Australian communications group, with 10 per cent.
Seven demonstrated the strategic value of the News stake on Wednesday with a
programming coup, securing access from next year to programmes from the
News-controlled Fox Television in the US.
These programmes, which potentially include The Simpsons, are on contract to
the rival Ten Network in Australia.

COLES MYER, the Australian retailing group, has announced plans to spend
ADollars 4.15bn (USDollars 2.8bn) over the next five years on a store
expansion plan aimed at lifting sales and margins, writes Bruce Jacques in
Sydney.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the programme - the largest
retailing expansion in Australia - would involve building 421 new stores,
refurbishing 1,136 others and expanding and building more than 12 shopping
centres.
'The investment programme is a major plank in our strategy to maximise
future profitability and returns to shareholders,' Mr Bartels said, adding
that it would be financed entirely from internal funds.
Mr Bartels said new and refurbished stores produced sales increases of
between 10 per cent and 30 per cent, improving investment returns.

Hungarian paper

MR RUPERT Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has sold his stake in the
Hungarian newspaper Mai Nap to the Bank of Credit of Hungary, the paper's
co-owner.
Mr Murdoch bought half of Mai Nap, an evening tabloid, for Dollars 3m and
had a let-out clause after three years - which he has now exercised in order
to get his original investment back.
It is believed News Corp pulled out because it was unable to gain control of
the publishing company.
The decision comes a year after the closure of Super, a daily tabloid
newspaper aimed at the former East Germany, which News Corp published in a
joint venture with Burda of Germany.
However, News Corp emphasised yesterday that there was no lack of interest
in eastern Europe.

PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, has suffered a setback in
its attempt to gain a vital CDollars 246m (USDollars 189m) equity injection
from American Airlines.
The Ontario Court of Appeal has rejected PWA's attempt to have the Gemini
reservations system declared insolvent. This would have allowed Canadian to
switch to American's Sabre system - a condition of American's equity
investment.
PWA is also asking the Federal Competition Tribunal to free it from Gemini,
and has offered its partners in the system - Air Canada and a group of US
airlines - a CDollars 20m settlement.
Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, appealed to the federal cabinet to intervene
and force a negotiated settlement between Canadian and its Gemini partners.
However, Air Canada replied that it would not negotiate the winding-up of
the reservation system.
PWA would not say whether it will take the Gemini issue to the Federal Court
of Appeal.
Confederation Life, one of Canada's top four life companies, is looking for
a capital infusion, after raising CDollars 240m earlier this year with a
European debenture issue.
Mr Paul Cantor, president, said the company was looking at several options,
including a preferred stock issue, converting the mutual into a public
shareholder-owned company and finding a partner.
Canada's 'big six' chartered banks are considered potential strategic
partners.

78m for second term
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON Corporation, the Canadian-controlled travel and publishing group,
yesterday reported a slight improvement in second-quarter earnings, but
cautioned that a true picture of its 1993 performance would only emerge
later in the year.
Net earnings rose to USDollars 78m, or 13 cents a share, from Dollars 70m,
or 12 cents, a year earlier. Six-month earnings for both years were Dollars
23m, or 3 cents.
Second-quarter sales dipped to Dollars 1.47bn from Dollars 1.53bn, largely
reflecting weaker sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar.
The travel division's operating earnings edged up to Dollars 31m from
Dollars 30m, excluding Dollars 3m of interest income this year, down from
Dollars 7m in 1992.
The company said, however, that earnings for the year would largely be
determined by results for the high-season third quarter.
Apart from the weak pound, Thomson painted an encouraging picture of
prospects for the travel business. Demand for summer 1993 holidays appeared
'approximately in line' with available capacity, and 'excessive' discounting
on brochure prices was unlikely.
Thomson Tour Operations' summer bookings are 14 per cent ahead of last year.
Winter bookings are 23 per cent up, partly due to an earlier launch of the
programme.
The fortunes of the publishing and newspaper interests are mixed. Earnings
at Thomson's UK regional newspapers are 'well above' last year, due to
rising advertising revenues. But advertising lineage in North America was
down 4 per cent in the first half, including a 7.2 per cent drop in Canada.
Circulation was also slightly lower.
However, Thomson said sagging revenues were more than offset by lower costs,
and that both profits and margins improved.
Professional publishing earnings have been dented by competitive pressures
in tax and legal publications and by the impact of the US government's
review of pharmaceutical advertising in medical magazines.
Nonetheless, the information and publishing group's operating earnings rose
to Dollars 78m in the second quarter, from Dollars 75m a year earlier.

stake
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government yesterday announced the sale of 20 per cent of its
shares in Bank Leumi, the country's second-biggest bank. The move comes less
than two months after it sold 16.5 per cent of its shares in Israel's
biggest bank, Bank Hapoalim.
The Bank Leumi sale, approved by the Knesset finance committee yesterday, is
due to take place this month. The offer is expected to raise between Shk850m
and Shk1.1bn (Dollars 298m to Dollars 386m).
The Hapoalim sale was 120 times oversubscribed, and analysts believe the
Leumi offer will also be heavily oversubscribed.
Indeed, several finance committee members initially expressed opposition to
the offer, arguing that the sale price was being set too low, and senior
management were being offered overly generous share purchase schemes.
The sale emphasises the Labour-led Israeli government's commitment to
divesting the state of its majority holdings in all Israel's major banks,
acquired after the October 1983 bank shares collapse.
In a second privatisation plan unveiled yesterday, Israel Aircraft
Industries said it would this year be offering 25 per cent of the shares in
its wholly-owned Elta electronics subsidiary for sale on the Tel Aviv stock
exchange.
IAI, one of Israel's largest companies, has been hit hard by the worldwide
downturn in defence spending. It has failed to make an entirely successful
transition into non-military alternatives, and recently said it would have
to cut 1,500 of its 16,100 staff.
Elta develops, manufactures and markets radar, electronic warfare,
communications and information systems and is one of the jewels in the IAI
crown. Sales in the first quarter of 1993 amounted to Dollars 72m, following
1992 sales of Dollars 257m.

<TEXT>
THE GAP, the fashion store group which until last summer was one of the most
promising companies in the US retail sector, yesterday revealed that
after-tax profits plunged by 24 per cent, to Dollars 28.7m, in the second
quarter of the current financial year.
Total sales in the three months to end-July increased by 13 per cent, to
Dollars 693m.
However, this was due largely to expansion: at the end of the quarter, The
Gap was running 1,350 stores - including 286 GapKids outlets and 170 Banana
Republic shops - compared with 1,265 last year.
The San Francisco-based company said that same-store sales rose by just 1
per cent for the quarter.
The latest results leave The Gap posting after-tax profits of Dollars 70.2m
in the first six months, down from Dollars 83m at the same stage last year.
Sales for the first half were Dollars 916.6m, compared with Dollars 792.5m.
Mr Donald Fisher, chairman, blamed a difficult retailing environment, and
said that lower merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs were largely
responsible for the decline in profits.
He added, however, that The Gap had been trying to rein in expenses and
stocks, noting that the company was holding 8 per cent less merchandise at
the end of the quarter compared with a year ago.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Canadian forestry shaken to its
roots - The industry faces another bout of upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY industry which has racked up losses of CDollars 4bn (USDollars 3.1bn) in
less than three years is bound to feel some after-shocks. In the case of
Canada's forestry sector, the upheaval is shaking many of the biggest
companies to their roots.
Further evidence of the industry's structural shift came this week with the
decision by Canadian Pacific, the transport and energy conglomerate, to
unload its entire 61 per cent stake in its lossmaking pulp and paper
subsidiary, CP Forest.
CP Forest joins a growing list of forestry companies emerging from the
sheltered embrace of a controlling shareholder into the more bracing
environment of a widely-held public company:
Earlier this year, Toronto's Bronfman group spun off its controlling
interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the biggest west coast forestry company;
An 82 per cent stake in Abitibi-Price, one of North America's biggest
newsprint producers, is in the hands of an international banking consortium
after the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the real estate developer. O&amp;Y had
pledged the shares as collateral for a large loan. According to one analyst,
at least one of the banks has started selling Abitibi shares into the
market;
New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge is cutting its stake in Fletcher Challenge
Canada from 72 per cent to 51 per cent;
After 80 years as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune, Quno, an
Ontario-based newsprint maker, is now a publicly-traded company in which its
former parent has a 49 per cent stake.
Meanwhile, a handful of smaller lumber producers have gone public, taking
advantage of rocketing timber prices earlier this year.
The shake-out is not over. Mr Ken Copeland, director of syndication at
Nesbitt Thomson, the securities firm which led the underwriting group for
the CP Forest deal, says that 'if you're a private company and you ever
thought about going public, the market is very receptive.'
Stone Container of Chicago has given notice of plans to spin off part of
wholly-owned Stone-Consolidated, a Montreal-based newsprint producer.
Mr Richard Kellertas, analyst at McLean McCarthy in Montreal, says that
other groups which may be set adrift by key shareholders include Weldwood,
controlled by the US group Champion International; Crestbrook Forest
Industries, in which Mitsubishi of Japan has a 25 per cent stake; and
Domtar, the papermaker controlled by the Caisse de Depot et Placement, the
Quebec public-sector pension fund.
The turbulence fits a pattern seen in previous cycles in the forestry
sector. Parent companies, many of them laden with debt and strapped for
cash, have become unable and/or unwilling to keep supporting subsidiaries
through quarter after quarter of red ink.
CP Forest, for instance, has been a significant drag on Canadian Pacific,
pulling down its operating income by CDollars 91.2m in the first six months
of this year, and CDollars 152.7m a year earlier.
Companies such as CP, Stone and Fletcher Challenge are now running out of
patience as they come under pressure from bankers and investors.
Prices of newsprint and pulp, the staples of the Canadian forestry industry,
are still in the doldrums.
While newsprint producers are crossing their fingers for a modest recovery
later this year, pulp mills have reconciled themselves to a weak market well
into 1994.
Many companies' financial strength will continue to be sapped even when the
recovery gets underway. Keeping pace with increasingly stringent
environmental laws will require heavy spending on recycling and pollution
abatement equipment.
In contrast to disenchanted parent companies, outside investors are
attracted by what may prove to be bargain share prices once commodity
markets improve. The Bronfmans' sold their MacMillan Bloedel shares last
March for CDollars 17.50 apiece. Earlier this week, they were trading at
CDollars 22.62.
The transformation from a closely-held entity to one with a widely-dispersed
group of public shareholders is also likely to create turbulence within many
companies.
CP Forest is among those renowned for its slow-moving management. The
pressure to perform is now likely to intensify. As Mr Kellertas puts it,
these companies 'now have a lot of shareholders to answer to, and
shareholders typically vote with their feet if they're not happy.'
MacMillan Bloedel has already responded by launching a far-reaching review
of its businesses. The review, to be completed around the end of this year,
could result in a more focused business strategy.
Wide ownership may turn out to be only the first stage of a drawn-out
process of change in the industry. Over the next year or two, a wave of
mergers, takeovers and asset disposals could separate the trees from the
saplings.

TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier, has won approval from a Delaware
bankruptcy court for its 'plan of reorganisation' after a day of hearings.
This should allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection within the next few weeks.
TWA entered bankruptcy in early 1992, when the company was still owned by Mr
Carl Icahn, the US financier.
Mr Glenn Zander, one of two co-chief executives at TWA, told the court that
the airline's performance was consistent with projections contained in its
reorganisation plan, and claimed that the airline would be viable if it
returned from bankruptcy.
The carrier has yet to decide where it would base its ongoing operations but
it was expected to announce yesterday that it would go to St Louis, its main
hub airport. TWA has been operating from Mount Kisco, New York,
Under the reorganisation, equity ownership would be split between employees,
in return for wage concessions, and creditors, in exchange for debt
forgiveness.
USAir, in which British Airways holds a minority stake, is acquiring five
gates at Orlando airport in Florida from United Airlines, the larger
Chicago-based carrier.
USAir added that it planned an agreement with United, under which the two
carriers would provide code-sharing flights from areas in the north-eastern
US to Miami, and then on to Latin America.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Johnson &amp; Johnson to shed 3,000
jobs

JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON has followed other US healthcare companies in announcing
big staff cuts in the face of pressure on drugs prices.
The company said this week it expected to shed 3,000 jobs this year, 1,000
of them through voluntary redundancies. The Dollars 200m cost has already
been provided for in a reserve set up last year.
The compulsory job losses will come through moves to streamline
administrative and other functions. However, the company said it had no
plans to abandon its decentralised structure, involving 28 operating
companies in the US alone.
Analysts said the job losses, from a total of 84,000, would have little
impact on overall costs. 'If they really want to concentrate on
cost-cutting, they will have to look again at their whole philosophy of
decentralisation,' said Mr Glenn Reicin, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New
York.
Operating companies will decide for themselves whether to implement the
voluntary redundancy plan.
All of the voluntary redundancies and most of the compulsory lay-offs will
come in the US. Job losses abroad will come from factory closures in France
and Brazil, as well as the consolidation of several European medical
businesses.
Other drugs companies that have announced job losses this year include
Warner Lambert and Bristol Myers-Squibb, while Merck recently said that
2,100 had accepted its voluntary redundancy plan.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ferfin investors see shares
plummet

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second-biggest private
sector company, collapsed on the Milan bourse yesterday as investors tried
to put a value on the debt-laden group's equity.
Trading closed at L299. Ferfin's shares last traded at L417.80 on Monday
before being suspended in advance of plans to slash the nominal share price
to L5 from L1,000. Yesterday's official price, based on the day's average,
was L224.40, after the shares opened at L101.
Separately, bank creditors to the group, which had total borrowings of
L28,838bn (Dollars 17.83bn) at the end of May, were told a rescue package,
expected later this month, would not be unveiled until mid-September.
Ferfin's share price has perplexed even hardened professionals on the
volatile Milan bourse. Although large write-downs in the nominal value of
shares are not unknown - it has happened twice in the past 20 years to the
Montedison industrial group, now controlled by Ferfin - there has never been
a write-down on this scale.
The country's leading shareholders' association told members to hold their
stock, in spite of the selling wave. The gap between supply and demand meant
it took 90 minutes to set an opening price.
The crisis began in late May, when the company revealed that total
borrowings had risen to about L31,000bn at the end of 1992. A five-member
committee of bank creditors, called in by the Ferruzzi family and Ferfin's
former managers, uncovered a range of financial irregularities, leading to a
sharp upwards revision of Ferfin's and Montedison's losses.
Separately, arrests by magistrates investigating the 18-month political
corruption scandal found Montedison had allegedly paid kickbacks of about
L135bn to politicians during the former Enimont chemicals joint venture with
the state-owned Eni group.
The small savers' association called for an investigation into why Ferfin,
which allegedly ran a separate set of books, was not more strictly
supervised. The association wants to know why the three independent
representatives at the company, required under Italian law, were unaware of
the alleged irregularities.
Shareholders have also criticised Price Waterhouse, Ferfin's auditors, which
certified its 1992 accounts. In June, Price Waterhouse withdrew its
certification when signs of alleged fraud emerged. Consob, the companies and
stock market watchdog, has also been attacked for not acting sooner.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Elkem returns to the black in
second quarter with NKr96m

<TEXT>
ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, has announced its first
quarterly pre-tax profit before extraordinary items for three years due to
cost-cutting, lower energy taxes and a stronger dollar.
The NKr96m (Dollars 12.85m) second-quarter profit helped the company rebound
to a NKr61m pre-tax profit in the first half from a NKr189m loss in the same
1992 period.
It confirms that the company is recovering following last year's crisis
refinancing, although the market outlook for many of its products remains
uncertain.
Net sales in the first half fell to NKr3.78bn from NKr3.82bn, but the
effects of a cost-cutting drive were apparent in the fall in operating costs
to NKr3.44bn from NKr3.59bn. Staff numbers have been cut by around 1,000 to
5,700 over the past 18 months.
Group financial expenses were also lower at NKr186m, compared with NKr203m.
Interest payments have fallen in line with a sharp reduction in net debt,
which at June 30 was NKr3.3bn, NKr1.2bn lower than at the start of the year.
The company was also able to book NKr60m back into its accounts as the cost
of withdrawing from high temperature waste treatment has proved less than
expected.
Elkem said ferro-alloy exports from the CIS and China were continuing at
high levels, adding to uncertainties over future price levels.
It also warned that western steel production may not continue to show the
same level of growth it displayed in the first half.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Joint management for Finnish
banks

<TEXT>
SKOPBANK and the Savings Bank of Finland, the Finnish banks, are to come
under joint management in a move to streamline their operations and improve
efficiency.
The banks have run up heavy losses and are controlled by the Government
Guarantee Fund, which has been set up to bail out the country's banking
system.
Mr Heikki Koivisto, head of the Government Guarantee Fund, said the move
would reduce overlaps between the two banks in treasury activities and
corporate banking. Skopbank will concentrate on international business,
wholesale banking and large corporate clients, while Savings Bank of Finland
will concentrate on the personal sector and small and medium-sized
businesses.
Mr Koivisto denied the reorganisation was a step towards a full merger of
the two banks, which have so far received a total of FM32bn (Dollars 5.44bn)
in state support. But he said it would assist in the long-term aim of
returning them to the private sector.
Analysts said the move removed speculation that the banks' activities would
be split and sold to other Finnish banks.
Savings Bank of Finland was formed last year from a merger of 41 regional
savings banks. Skopbank is the central bank of the savings banks.
