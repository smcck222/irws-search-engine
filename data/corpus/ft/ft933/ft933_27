FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Group seeks consensus on bus plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER FOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on London First and bus deregulation ('Business group
attacks plan to deregulate London's buses', August 9) is misleading in that
the paper to which it refers does not attack or, for that matter, support
deregulation.
As stated in the paper's introduction, its aim is to build a consensus
around a number of practical proposals to ensure deregulation capitalises on
the significant improvements achieved in recent years.
We aim to work in partnership with others to achieve continuing improvements
in London.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Government's code of practice contains too many
exceptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAURICE FRANKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I enter some reservations about John Willman's optimistic account
of how the new voluntary open government code of practice will work under
the ombudsman's supervision ('Eagle eye turned on Whitehall's secrecy',
August 9)?
Before asking how effectively the ombudsman will secure compliance, it is
worth asking what precisely there is to comply with. Unlike freedom of
information laws (FOI) overseas the code does not offer access to documents.
The government says it will answer questions but not release original
paperwork - a fundamental defect. There is no comparison between the
detailed truth of records, assumptions, oversights, calculations,
contradictions and so on, and a brief letter giving the department's edited
summary.
Access under the code will be limited to 'factual information'. Analysis,
projections and the technical advice of government experts will be withheld.
So will anything considered 'unreliable' or 'misleading'. Would the monthly
unemployment figures - whose 'unreliable' statistical basis has prompted
innumerable recalculations in recent years - be available under these
criteria?
There is also a formidable series of exemptions, many more sweeping than
under FOI legislation. How much of the truth will appear in the trickle of
remaining facts? The ombudsman might find that most secrecy is beyond his
reach, being permitted by the code's overgenerous exemptions.
The suggestion that only the ombudsman and not the courts can examine
documents protected by public interest immunity certificates is incorrect.
As the Matrix Churchill case demonstrated, a judge can examine them and -
unlike the ombudsman - order their disclosure even if the government
objects.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Vocational training debate needs answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RODNEY J COPPING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader item, 'Leaving school' (August 10), reiterates the
never-ending debate without resolution on vocational training.
The plethora of reviews and reports has failed miserably in identifying a
basic requirement. There is a fundamental need to make business and
education interface directly, perhaps statutorily, and with consistent joint
funding.
The current fragmented and piecemeal initiatives, hyped by lip service and
inadequately funded, will leave vocational training as it has been regarded
for a hundred years - an activity for the underprivileged.
Educationalists and industrialists should stop debating where responsibility
lies and jointly commit substantial resources to a long-term strategy for
educating and training our future workforce.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: European leaders shamed by failure to help defend
Bosnian Moslems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I S HUTCHESON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to congratulate Edward Mortimer on his article on Bosnia,
'Wrong order of priority' (August 4).
Every time that the topic of Bosnia is raised I feel a deep sense of
personal shame and humiliation as a result of continuous violations of the
most basic tenets of civilisation going unchecked and unpunished - shame as
a citizen of the UK and Europe, humiliation through anger and impotence.
The failure of western Europe to respond to flagrant racially motivated
aggression in its immediate area of influence, when the west possessed
overwhelming military power to resist or punish it, will be condemned by
history.
Europe, with the UK to the fore, appears to have contrived the military
disadvantage and ultimate defeat of the Bosnian Moslems through an arms
embargo, knowing that the Serbs had obtained the major part of the old
Yugoslavia's weaponry and also possessed an efficient arms industry of their
own.
The situation has been made disastrously worse by tantalisingly assuring the
Moslems of a fair settlement that would not reward aggression. Had we told
them the truth - that we would not allow them the weapons necessary to
defend themselves and would not defend them either - they would have had to
face reality and negotiate a settlement before the privations and huge loss
of innocent lives that have taken place.
We can surely only forgive Moslems throughout the world if they subscribe to
a conspiracy theory. If it were not for the collective vacillating
incompetence displayed by our leadership, to say nothing of lack of moral
courage, I could easily subscribe to such a theory myself. I hope it is not
true.
We are living through a dark period of European history, and the exchange
rate mechanism is indeed of little relative consequence. We should all
remember that civilisation is precious and one of the few things worth
fighting for. It is only skin deep, the skin has been broken and we are
haemorrhaging.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Monetary union may not be so hard to achieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN HARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Commentators on the recent changes in the exchange rate mechanism seem
largely agreed that monetary union has become less likely. Some have even
claimed that the Maastricht process is now dead.
Careful reading of the treaty and its protocols may suggest a different
picture.
Article 3 of the protocol on the convergence criteria specifies that: 'The
criterion on participation in the exchange rate mechanism. . . shall mean
that a member state has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided
for by the exchange rate mechanism. . . without severe tensions for at least
the last two years before the examination.'
Since the changes to the ERM take the form of a broadening of the 'normal
fluctuation margins', this criterion would now seem rather easier to fulfil
than was the case before.

FT  11 AUG 93 / A king and his people: Belgium's late monarch was a rare
symbol of national identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium as such seems to inspire little affection, in either of its main
linguistic communities, I wrote in the Weekend FT of July 31.
Bad timing. That very day King Baudouin died, and his death unleashed a
great outpouring of national grief, in which, it seems, Dutch-speaking
Flemings and French-speaking Walloons joined quite indiscriminately. In a
country of only 10m people, hundreds of thousands queued outside the royal
palace to file past his body.
A cartoon in Le Monde showed Flemings and Walloons approaching the palace
from different directions in separate queues, but emerging on the other side
as a single, tearful cortege. That may be jumping quickly to conclusions, as
the paper's correspondent admitted next day. 'It is too soon,' he wrote, 'to
count the 'unitarists' and the 'separatists', since the latter could hardly
show themselves at a funeral.'
Certainly there is no easy way to tell how many of those who stayed at home
in front of their TV sets approved the attitude of the Vlaams Blok, the
Flemish separatist party, which did officially boycott the ceremonies; and
even those who did feel a pang of respect for the dead king as a person were
not necessarily transformed thereby into fervent Belgian patriots.
But two conversations from my recent journey through Belgium came
immediately to mind when I heard of the king's death. One was with an old
family friend, completely non-political, who is herself very much a Walloon
but had a Flemish mother. What's the future of this country, I asked, and
her answer took me by surprise: 'Personally I doubt if it'll survive the
present king. To my mind he's a kind of saint.'
The other conversation was with a Belgian about as different from my friend
as one could imagine: Mr Guido Sweron, director of the Flemish cultural
centre in Fouron Saint-Martin (or, as he would prefer to call it, St Martens
Voeren), one of six predominantly French-speaking villages that somehow got
included in the Flemish province of Limburg back in 1962, and whose destiny
has been a bone of contention in Belgian politics ever since.
Mr Sweron is what the Walloons call un flaminguant. That is to say, he is
not just Flemish but militantly so. In his office he keeps a large map
showing practically the whole of eastern Belgium as the Duchy of Limburg, as
indeed it was a few centuries ago. (Limbourg, the original seat of the
duchy, is now in the heart of Wallonia, east and south of Liege.)
He argues that the people of this area were all historically Flemings, but
that those in the southern part have been forcibly Frenchified over the
centuries to the point where they no longer properly understand their own
identity; and he seems to think that this entitles, indeed obliges, the
state to ignore what the inhabitants think about themselves now, at least
until they have had a good dose of Flemish reindoctrination from people like
himself.
'Belgium,' Mr Sweron said, 'doesn't make any sense any more: it's just kept
alive for the king, and for some capitalistic powers - and for Brussels.'
Poor old king, I remember thinking. Half his subjects believe he's a saint,
keeping himself alive for Belgium's sake, while the other half think Belgium
is only being kept alive to give him a job. But both seem to agree that,
apart from him, or apart from the monarchy, there is precious little of
Belgium left.
Only the royal family now escapes the otherwise absolute division of the
country into linguistic communities. No one else is allowed to be just
Belgian. You have to be either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking (unless you
belong to the tiny German minority on the eastern frontier); it is in that
capacity that you vote, receive education, and even serve in the armed
forces.
I asked Mr Sweron whether the real aim of Flemings who thought like him was
to reverse the 1830 revolution, which brought Belgium into existence, and
reunite the Dutch-speaking part of the country with Holland.
'No,' he said. 'It's not necessary for us to join Holland, or for them to
join France. We thought the solution was to get a federation here in Belgium
but, since we are building a federation in Europe, if we give 40 per cent of
the power to Europe and 40 per cent to ourselves (ie, to the provinces) it's
not worth keeping Belgium just for 20 per cent.'
So there you have it. Behind Belgium's enthusiasm for a federal Europe lurks
the hope of Flemings and Walloons that it will enable them to do away with
Belgium altogether. Which leads me to think there might be a connection, if
only at an unconscious level, between the wave of emotion that greeted King
Baudouin's death and the crisis of the European exchange rate mechanism,
which happened the same weekend.
Perhaps, in expressing their grief at the loss of a monarch who had become
almost the only remaining embodiment of Belgian national identity, the
Belgians were reacting to the discovery that a federal Europe is not after
all just round the corner. Perhaps some of them are thinking that a
nation-state, even a rather artificial bilingual one, may have its uses for
a while longer.
Personally I hope so. I like Belgium. Bilingualism, which many Belgians find
irksome, strikes me as something to be envied. The interplay of Gallic and
Flemish culture in the Low Countries has been going on for a thousand years
or more, and has produced some of Europe's greatest art. Complete separation
on linguistic lines would be a sad way for it to end.

Should we count Jonathan Ross's series Fantastic Facts] as a success or a
failure? Launched as a sort of 'Tit Bits' of the air, it went into ITV's Top
30 at No 18 in its first week, with an audience of 9.9m. However, its second
episode slipped to No 28 with 7.7m, since when it has hovered around the No
30 spot with about 7m viewers. It is up against the Paul Daniels quiz show
Every Second Counts on BBC1 which is currently attracting about 6.4m
viewers.
So during that half hour the audience is pretty evenly split between
Britain's two main channels. At 7.30, however, Coronation Street begins, for
decades the biggest and most consistent ratings winner in the UK.
The Roundhouse at Chalk Farm in London used to be one of the best
performance spaces in the metropolis. But since we were threatened with the
racist notion of turning it into a 'black arts centre' in the 1980s the
place has been out of action. It will be interesting to see whether Black
Bag Special (9.00 C4) manages to resist the lure of black separatism, or
apartheid as it would be called elsewhere.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Going Out versus Staying In - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is, people insist, much the best to be there: whether Wimbledon or the
Royal Tournament, rock festival or Comedy Store; while television may convey
an approximation of the 'real' experience, there is no substitute for
actually going along. In the past this column has considered the subject
specifically in relation to sport and concluded that there is, indeed, a
certain something - the strawberry factor - about going to Wimbledon, and
risking skin cancer from all that sun for the sake of the smell of crushed
grass.
Yet there is also a powerful argument for staying on the old green sofa in
the cool of your own sitting room in front of your television. At home there
are no men in uniforms ordering you about, you can drink your own properly
chilled Sancerre, and people do not sit behind you explaining Navratilova's
sexual relationships in stage whispers. Travel time to and from the sofa is
negligible, and at home you have all the advantages of umpteen camera
positions and the zoom lens which are denied those who pay the appalling
price of a Centre Court ticket.
What about the sort of events more commonly reviewed on this page though?
Can television ever hope to provide more than a vague idea of the experience
of sitting in a West End theatre as the house lights go down, of being a
part of a big audience dominated by the big screen in a cinema, of feeling
the expectation in a concert hall as the conductor raises his baton? A
refresher course in Going Out can leave you in two minds. Certainly there
are aspects of live entertainment that television fails to convey, but the
incidentals, at least in a big city  - travel, tickets, food and drink,
fellow members of the audience - can be enough to make you vow never to
relinquish the old green sofa again.
In comparing the two experiences we do tend to underestimate the sheer
convenience of television. In London today, unless you have a chauffeur, the
only way of being sure you can reach any venue and park close by is to drive
a motorcycle, and not everyone is as game as Mrs Dunkley when it comes to
riding pillion. (Yes, when necessary in evening dress.) You can easily spend
the price of a whole year's licence fee on two opera tickets or three
moderate seats in a Shaftesbury Avenue theatre. In the all too accurately
named crush bar two glasses of ghastly blended table wine will cost you
around Pounds 4, and there is a dreadful tendency now to provide only
'souvenir' programmes which means the format of Radio Times and a price of
Pounds 6.
While you have control over those with whom you watch television, the same
is obviously not true when you Go Out. If you are fortunate enough to be
invited by John Drummond, director of the BBC Proms, to share his box, as we
were on Sunday, you may find yourself sitting with Sir David and Lady
Attenborough - and what could be more pleasant. However, buy yourself a
couple of Pounds 25 seats at the Prince Edward to see the Gershwin musical
Crazy For You and you may find yourself towards the back of the circle
behind three vast teenage girls who continually lean forward in their seats,
forcing everyone behind to do the same, and eat sweets out of cellophane
bags seemingly prepared by some insane sound effects department. That does
not happen with television.
As for the cinema, on the day after we saw Jurassic Park last week it was
announced that this had become the biggest grossing movie of all time in
Britain, a fact which scarcely surprised us since we had had to pay Pounds
10 each for seats, not in the West End but at the Parkway, Camden Town.
True, when we left the cinema there was a pianist playing in the bar,
supporting the claim printed on the back of the tickets that they are
'Making movie going an occasion'. But it was also true that we sat through
the film with our feet on a thick layer of popcorn, on top of a worn-out and
badly torn carpet. Funny sort of occasion.
But what about the content of these events? Spielberg's dinosaur
extravaganza is so determined to terrify the life out of you that it
produces a defiant reaction: 'Garn] Can't frighten me]' Yet it is one of
those films that will lose much of its impact when it comes to television.
Whereas the subtle frights of a Hitchcock can be as effective on the small
screen as the large, Jurassic Park relies upon the overwhelming size of its
cinema images and the deafening volume of trillion-track Dolby sound for its
effect, and those will not be available on the box. So if you do want to see
dinosaurs chasing children and crunching adults, see it in the cinema. Score
one, reluctantly, for Going Out.
We happened to see Crazy For You on the same night that the Queen took her
mother for a 93rd birthday treat, along with her sister and umpteen other
members of the royal family. This created an even more monumental traffic
jam than usual around Soho, and thus even more smugness among motorcyclists.
There may have been another effect, too: the company seemed to perform with
abnormal energy, as companies will when the royals are in. Since this is a
classic American musical with a tap line 10-babes long, and a great
basketful of Gershwin hits - 'Someone To Watch Over Me', 'I Got Rhythm',
'They Can't Take That Away From Me' and many more - the effect was
electrifying . . . or perhaps they really are that good every night.
Anyway, even without any special royal edge, there is something about the
stage musical which has never been transferred successfully to television.
To experience the full sense of hair-raising exhilaration from, say, a
massed tap routine you have to be in a theatre seeing the thing live, with
no chance of anyone 'dubbing in the taps'. The same goes for those typically
American stage-wide dance routines, such as Embraceable You in this show,
where there is no chance, as with television, of cutting together the best
bits from five takes, and the dancers end up, chests heaving for breath,
with the whole house on a roar. Score another, very definitely, for Going
Out.
As for the Proms, the experience varies. When the front promenaders turned
round on Monday last week and chanted 'Arena to gallery: tonight's concert
can be heard on Radio 3' even Mr Drummond seemed to think they had a point,
murmuring 'They've been quite witty this year'. The point was that The
Hanover Band playing an all-Bach programme on period instruments did not
produce a great enough volume of sound, some of the time anyway, for the
marvellous and familiar but very large space inside the Albert Hall. That
said, the Concerto for Violin and Oboe, and especially Anthony Robson's
performance on the oboe, was simply splendid, large space or not. But had
this been televised, home viewers would have had no trouble at all with
sound - as the promenaders' message indicated. Score one for Going Out and
one for staying home.
So Going Out emerges from this refresher course pretty robustly; the
vitality of live events and the uniqueness of each performance score
heavily. However, if you throw the incidentals into the scales the balance
tips back dramatically towards the old green sofa. And what could you see on
television in the past week? The second part of Billy Roche's powerful
Wexford Trilogy, first performed at The Bush, a tiny fringe theatre with a
name for innovation but cramped and uncomfortable seating. The third in a
new series of the amazingly effective (even if, perhaps because, the content
can be infuriating) Teenage Diaries, a form impossible to imagine outside
television. A repeat of a hilarious episode of French And Saunders (with the
'Looky Likeys', a parody of The Exorcist and an embarrassingly accurate
publisher's lunch) and more. Of course watching television is not the same
as being there, but nor is being there the same as watching television. You
miss an awful lot if you go out every night.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Weill success at Santa Fe - Paul Griffiths enjoys a
pre-Brecht double bill at the Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opera best made for Santa Fe has to be The Magic Flute: thunderstorms
are almost guaranteed to be rolling around the nearby mountains as the sky
darkens during performances in the open theatre, and Sarastro's crew are
right at home in a city whose 20th-century psychic history goes back from
the shamanic healers and Eriksonian hypnotists of today to a 1911 Masonic
temple shaped as a Moorish fantasy in strawberry mousse.
Almost inevitably, the piece is a regular here. This year's new production,
though, cut away from awesomeness and spirituality to side with Papageno's
vulgar good sense. Marie Anne Chiment's costumes were on the lurid side of
dreaminess: robes of scarlet and purple for the adepts, snowy fur and little
forehead lights that made the boys look like Christmas-tree decorations.
Reto Nickler's staging provided the pantomime that Mikael Melbye, as
Papageno, knew well how to handle. In such a context, Kurt Streit's handsome
and musically fine Tamino provided a challenge that was never resolved.
As on previous occasions, the festival's successes were in areas that the
place would not seem to suit so well. For example, nothing could be less in
harmony with this relaxed, sunny, natural city than the music of Kurt Weill,
and yet it was a double bill of pre-Brecht Weill - The Protagonist and The
Tsar has his Photograph Taken, both to words by Georg Kaiser - that provided
the Santa Fe Opera with both its novelty and its sharpest night. The
director Jonathan Eaton and his designer Robert Perdziola set both pieces in
the 1920s of their composition, and so neutralised the costume-drama
tendencies in The Protagonist (as Mr Eaton rightly pointed out, the music
speaks of Weimar Germany, not of the libretto's Elizabethan England) while
availing themselves of opportunities for a comic-glamorous look just right
for The Tsar.
Both works ostensibly have to do with persons and personae. The protagonist
of The Protagonist is an actor whose mood is swung by what he happens to be
playing. His sister, who has been his sheet anchor to truth, finds him
rehearsing a piece of slapstick, and judges this will be a good moment to
introduce her secret lover. By the time she returns, however, the play has
been changed, and she spills the news to a man wrapped up in a drama of
sexual jealousy.
In The Tsar people are clear about where roles end and reality begins; it is
the situation that confuses them. The tsar, escaping from public duty for a
moment, wants to flirt with the lady photographer whose studio he has
entered. But the photographer is a disguised anarchist, and her camera is
loaded with a pistol. All through both pieces, then, there is a weapon
waiting to go off: the febrile actor's capacity to carry out in life the
deeds of murderous revenge he executes on the stage, and the weapon in the
photographic apparatus. What makes for catastrophe in The Protagonist is in
The Tsar a joke.
Yet musically the pieces are more similar than that might imply. Writing
very much in the wake of Busoni and Hindemith, Weill shared their ideal of
music moving over its own planes aside from the dramatic continuity, and the
Santa Fe double bill pointed up how much of the familiar Brecht-Weill irony
 -the ostinatos, marches and dances, the embittered harmony - came out of
those musical exemplars and was in place before the composer met the
playwright to match him. In accordance with the precedence of pure music -
or rather of impure music - the chief glory of The Protagonist is its pair
of mime sequences: spiky wind music for the farce, and ominously seductive
hints from the cello of a slow uncurling line in the tragedy. The score was
beautifully played here under George Manahan.
On the vocal side this opera is, fittingly, a vehicle for the protagonist,
and Jacque Trussel seized it with a fury of intensity. In The Tsar, David
Malis offered a nice contrast of bluff jollity. He was also a ready Marcello
in the charming revival of La Boheme that boasted too a bright Rodolfo from
Martin Thompson and an excellent orchestral performance, perceptive and
sophisticated, under John Keenan.
John Crosby, moving spirit of this festival for 37 years and unashamed
Strauss nut, conducted a luscious Capriccio that was elegantly presented by
the director Willy Decker and designer Wolfgang Gussmann as a play of vivid
facsimiles - 18th-century ladies and gentlemen in white, ivory and silver -
within a blank space of effulgent blue. The frank realism of these people's
behaviour - their evident belief in themselves - was thoroughly beguiling,
and yet they were placed in a nowhere. They were clouds singing about
clouds.
As such they were the perfect creatures for this opera in which the audience
is invited into a long, lingering enjoyment of knowing pretence. All that
was wanted was more cream and radiance in the singing. Sheri Greenawald as
the Countess had a potentially lustrous performance checked by the need to
control flare and vibrato. Mark Thomsen and James Michael McGuire as the
composer and poet were eager young blades, without suggesting that their
music might exceed expressive need. But Richard Stilwell's amused urbanity
was entirely enough for the Count, and Eric Halfvarson was ideal as the old
pro La Roche, robustly in command of the interior theatre, the box within a
box, where he offered his dancer and Italian duettists. Whether they all
knew they were similarly on show - personae not persons - was a question
left poised exquisitely in the air.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Youth Orchestras young and old - The Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt of the highlight of this Proms season so far. The appearance of the
Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra under its founder Claudio Abbado at the Albert
Hall on Monday not only brought a richly concentrated account of Bruckner's
Fifth Symphony but also the treat of Dmitri Hvorotovsky singing Musorgsky's
Songs and Dances of Death in Shostakovich's 1962 orchestration.
Hvorotovsky's approach may owe much to Boris Christoff's (and to
Shalyapin's) model - a touch of histrionics in the outer songs, smooth
sensuous lyricism in the central pair - but his burnished tonal range,
effortless phrasing and sustained concentration were all utterly
instinctive. The effect may have been generalised rather than specific, for
he did not pay too much attention to the weighting of the words, but the
sheer sound quality and vocal presence were overwhelming.
The Gustav Mahler Orchestra convened for the first time in 1986; designed
originally as a platform for young musicians from Eastern Europe, it is now
open to East and West. The tonal blend is certainly the familiar
international one, and with an age limit of 26 the orchestra has very much
the feel of a professional band, yet one fuelled by an enormous sense of
commitment and unity of purpose.
Abbado's Bruckner has generally received less attention than his Mahler; he
may have conducted the composer less consistently, but early in his career
he made a memorable recording of the unfashionable Second Symphony. To some
tastes his approach may now seem too interventionist; instead of the serene
unfolding of the first movement of the Fifth a fairly brisk tempo was set
for the introduction and there was an urgent prompting of each episode and
transition. Yet Abbado's for detail is constantly engaging, and his ability
to slot each figurative element into a comprehensive scheme paid huge
dividends in every movement. The final pages, with the Mahler Orchestra's
brass uninhibitedly prominent, were an authentic triumph.
*****
On Sunday Britain's own National Youth Orchestra had brought one of its
typically hefty programmes to the Albert Hall. It began and ended with
Musorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, which both Radio 3 continuity and the
Radio Times appear to have decided should be called Pictures from an
Exhibition: Shura Cherkassky played the original solo-piano version at the
start of evening - a mannered account, surprisingly drab by Cherkassky's
standards - and the NYO under Matthias Bamert closed the concert with a
glittering, extrovert Ravel's orchestration, propelled at a pace that was as
hasty as the pianist's had been laboured.
Cherkassky also appeared with the orchestra in Gershwin's Piano Concerto, in
which he seemed much more relaxed, winningly shaping the work's store of
melodies and evidently relishing the extra succulence which the NYO's
over-size complement of strings brought to the textures. Bamert led the
orchestra through the thickets of Gawain's Journey, the orchestral study
fashioned from Birtwistle's opera. It was a remarkably assured account of a
spectacular piece, and the young players took the solo roles - euphonium,
flugel horn and oboe are allotted the vocal lines incorporated into the
orchestral textures - with enormous relish.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Ballet has now entered its runner in the summer's Romeo and
Juliet stakes. This is the version which Sir Frederick Ashton made for the
Royal Danish Ballet in 1955 - a significant date because it was not until
the next year that Western audiences were to be bowled over by the Bolshoi's
massive spectacular. Ashton was, as it were, creating 'blind', with no
pre-conceptions. The result is small-scale, poetic in a sometimes secret way
 -you have to watch closely to see certain little choreographic marvels that
Ashton offers, witness the ball-room duet for the lovers - and ultimately a
production that does not pack enough emotional punch. With the Danes, the
playing was so true, so detailed and so natural, that the choreography won
on its own terms. With ENB, it looks like Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare - a
few highlights, and an awful lot of workaday prose.
On Monday the men provided the chief merits of the performance. In Thomas
Edur, the Romeo, we see the finest classical danseur in the country
(Mukhamedov is hors concours). The opening scene, a brief solo for Romeo, is
enough to reveal his qualities. Edur displays a refinement of means, an
elegance of style, an effortless sense of drama, that seem a text-book
example of the virtues we hope for in a danseur noble. What is especially
grateful to watch is the purity and unforced nobility of his manner. The
dance speaks with extreme distinction; the playing is sure in its effects,
lyrical in its intonation. We believe, both in Romeo and in the classic
dance itself.
His companions were Tim Almaas as a lively, quick-tempered Mercutio, and
Stephen Sherriff as Benvolio. Sherriff has regained that exactness and
distinction of style - steps made to look witty - that was his as a valued
soloist with the Royal Ballet. From Kevin Richmond a menacing Tybalt,
dangerous to cross, and quick in feeling: how angry, and vivid, his death.
The Juliet was Rebecca Sewell. Her reading is much more assured technically
than last year, and she is charmingly the young girl of the opening scenes.
I missed, though, something inevitable about the later action, the signs of
both bravery and despair, and of awakened sexual feelings, even in Ashton's
understated dances. It is a failing of this version that it is not ecstatic
enough, does not tell us - as Ashton so beautifully did for Chloe,
Cinderella, and the Girl Pigeon - about the intensity of young love. Rebecca
Sewell must find a way to increase the emotional temperature of this cool
production.
ENB's artists bustled industriously through group scenes that have an
underpopulated feel, and a utilitarian look in Peter Rice's designs. (Friar
Lawrence, though, has a couple of fetching outfits.) The score sounded very
well under David Garforth's baton, with a strong rhythmic drive that did not
miss the pungent qualities of Prokofiev's writing. There was drama here we
did not see in the choreography.
ENB presents Romeo and Juliet until Aug 14. Casting varies.

Owners Abroad yesterday confirmed that Michael Julien, 55, former chief
executive of Storehouse is to become non-executive chairman from the
beginning of September.
Last month, the holiday company said that group profits this year are likely
to be half market expectations. While successfully fighting off a takeover
bid from rival Airtours, Owners Abroad had given the impression that its
prospects were rosy. Although the group insists the market deteriorated
after the bid battle had ended, chairman Howard Klein announced his
resignation in July.
Prior to Storehouse, Julien was successively finance director of BICC,
Midland Bank and Guinness.

FT  11 AUG 93 / People: Enterprise finance man seeks fresh endeavour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Walmsley, managing director in charge of finance at Enterprise Oil, is
to leave the company at the end of the year after a decade in the job.
The announcement yesterday surprised the City and knocked 12p off the
company's shares, which closed at 439p.
Walmsley, 46, had been expected by some analysts to be a strong candidate
for the chief executive's role if Graham Hearne, who holds both that post
and the chairmanship, should decide to relinquish it.
Analysts were taken aback that he had decided to go even though he has no
job in prospect as yet. 'I have absolutely nothing lined up,' he said
yesterday.
Walmsley, who trained as an accountant, joined the company from Arthur
Andersen in 1984.
'I was trying to get a role for Andersen advising Enterprise but ended up
joining as finance director and the role developed from there.'
Walmsley, widely respected in the City for his role in building Enterprise
into a highly rated company, said he wanted fresh challenges.
'I want the stimulus of building something' he explained.
He will be succeeded by Andrew Shilston, group treasurer.
In turn, John van der Welle, corporate finance manager becomes group
treasurer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's goodbye for a week to my spouse,
For the pleasures of yachting at Cowes.
I'll be hosting all day
At our corporate chalet
And each night I'm obliged to carouse.
Two years after penning this winning entry for a competition in The
Independent, the author is moving to a company where severe belt-tightening
rather than carousing will be the order of the day.
Maurice Dixson, who in addition to being a keen limerick writer, has had a
distinguished career with British Aerospace (owners of the above-mentioned
corporate chalet) and GEC, is moving to Simon Engineering as its new chief
executive, in succession to Brian Kemp.
Michael Davies, installed as chairman only last month, has lost no time in
recruiting a new executive boss who has, as Davies puts it, 'the opportunity
to restore the company's fortunes in a way that Brian perhaps doesn't'
In May the company warned of a loss for the first half of this year which
would then put it in breach of one of its banking covenants.
In addition, some institutional shareholders are understood to have been
unhappy that Kemp, 49, who was awarded a seven per cent pay increase last
year despite a 71 per cent fall in profits. Others blamed him for the
unsuccessful diversification into environmental businesses.
'Simon is a very famous name; one of the attractions of the job is to
restore it to where it ought to be, in the forefront of British engineering'
says Dixson, adding that he will be going in with his 'eyes open'.
Dixson, 51, who in the mid 1960s did an Oxford doctoral thesis in the
politics and economics of defence procurement, has been on the board of GEC
for the past three and a half years, as group managing director in charge of
the electronic metrology and components groups.
Prior to that he had been at BAe, latterly as managing director of the
commercial aircraft side and before that as chief executive of Royal
Ordnance.
His name, together with that of Dudley Eustace, now finance director of
Philips, was at one time in the ring as a possible successor to former
chairman Sir Raymond Lygo.
He says there will be 'a fairly short-term' handover period with Kemp,
followed by 'a longer period of consultation when he will be at the end of a
telephone.'

John Thomas, the head of BBC Publications, publishers of the Radio Times, is
to be the new managing director of BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of
the BBC.
He replaces James Arnold-Baker who has been appointed chief executive of the
Oxford University Press.
Thomas, who is 49, takes over immediately and will join the board of
management.
He joined the corporation as director of magazines in 1986 after spending 17
years with Reed Business Publishing, the last two as managing director of
its medical publishing division.
Since 1988, Thomas, who has a chemistry degree from Leeds University and a
PhD from Keele University, has also been chairman of Redwood Publishing, a
BBC subsidiary. Including Redwood, the BBC says it is the third largest
consumer magazine publisher in the UK, with titles ranging from Fast Forward
to BBC Wildlife.
Thomas will have the task of trying to raise more money to plough back into
BBC programmes.
In the 1992/93 financial year BBC Enterprises had a turnover of Pounds 233m
including co-production deals.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Management: Selectors' choice - Andrew Baxter explains how
JCB reorganised 300 employees into separate product divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an office wall at JC Bamford Excavators' headquarters at Rocester
in Staffordshire which three of the company's senior executives are unlikely
to forget.
At the turn of the year the wall held the names of some 300 JCB employees
whose individual strengths and weaknesses were discussed, analysed - and
occasionally tussled over - by Henry Shirman, Mike Butler and John Appleby.
The process was a vital prelude to the reorganisation into separate product
businesses (and profit centres) of the main divisions of the UK's largest
construction equipment company.
Appointed to the top posts in the new businesses by chief executive Martin
Coyne, who conceived the new organisation with chairman Sir Anthony Bamford,
the three had the unenviable task of sitting down together to select their
teams.
'We tried very hard to be fair,' says Shirman, formerly director of
manufacturing and product engineering who is now managing director of the
new backhoe loader division. (Butler, formerly managing director of JCB
Sales, is running the new loadall division, while Appleby has moved from
purchasing director to running the new wheeled loader division.)
Everybody was assessed on eight different characteristics and, if the three
could not agree, they would turn to Coyne or personnel director Alan
Fernyhough for help.
For Sir Anthony, the process has been a revealing one. When making a
reorganisation such as this, he says: 'You can't rely too heavily on past
assessments of people, because these tend to err on the side of being nice.
In a crisis when you are laying people off, you look at the assessments and
everyone is bloody marvellous.'
In contrast, the much more rigorous 'names-on-the-wall' process has brought
into focus the team players and those who were coasting. Inevitably, some
faces did not fit, although less than 10 people had to go. But valuable
insights into the remainder were gained, enabling the three new divisional
leaders to 'take a chance' on some people by increasing their
responsibilities.
JCB has had a decentralised structure before. In 1984 it broke up a
previously unitary organisation into product divisions, but four years later
went back to the original structure for its main Rocester-based products,
which helped to tighten management of product design and development. The
smaller divisions such as JCB Landpower for agricultural products were kept
separate.
The new approach, introduced in April, creates divisions which will have
exclusive responsibility for the future of the main product lines -
everything from design and product development to marketing.
Basic manufacturing such as welding will still be done centrally, but the
new divisions will each be responsible for painting and final assembly.
Shirman retains a central research responsibility for the group, because of
the dominance of backhoe loaders in the sales mix.
'With hindsight,' says Sir Anthony, 'what we didn't do in the mid-1980s was
to split the products up enough as businesses. We did not make them into
proper profit centres.'
The aim is to create multi-disciplinary teams which will sit together and
concentrate solely on one product line. The hope is that by identifying more
closely with a particular product employees at all levels will understand
the need for increased profitability and be encouraged to participate in
achieving it.
JCB is betting that, as it grows bigger, this approach makes better sense
than having one product engineering and manufacturing department serving a
combined marketing and sales division. With marketing - a crucial skill in
the construction equipment industry - now under the control of the new
profit centres, the three divisions' only internal 'customer' is a new sales
and service division.
But there are obvious risks in the new structure. Probably the biggest
danger from decentralisation, Sir Anthony accepts, is the dissipation of the
company's considerable purchasing power for parts and components.
To retain this, one of the three divisions will act as 'lead buyer' for a
particular component, such as engines, and negotiate on behalf of all three.
But if it makes commercial sense for one of the divisions to source
components separately, it will do so.
Other concerns include how to avoid duplicating contacts with dealers, who
sell the entire JCB range, and thus provide the essential link with
end-users and market trends.
But the benefits of the new organisation are already coming through. 'We can
move faster. The incentive to look at new ideas is much greater,' says
Butler.
Appleby, who has one of the toughest tasks at JCB reviving the 'poor
relation' wheeled-loader range, says there were initial question marks about
whether the new structure could make a difference.
'But we now have much more of a team spirit. The one thing in my team's life
is wheeled loaders.' Already the new approach has led to an improvement in
quality and spurred suggestions from the team about modifications.
The handling of warranties has also been changed. The new sales and service
division charges out warranty costs directly to the new divisions, giving
them an incentive to fix a problem quickly and ensure that it does not
happen again.
Some grey areas such as training remain, but Sir Anthony believes the new
approach will bring a marked improvement in profitability by next year.
And that is important for JCB, even if, as a family-owned company, it does
not have a share price to worry about. What it does show is that a company
widely admired as a rare success story in post-war British engineering is
true to its motto - jamais content.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: A balancing act - A look at
the green performance reports just published by Britain's biggest
electricity generating companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's largest electricity generating companies, National Power and
PowerGen, are also its largest polluters. Between them they spewed more than
2m tonnes of sulphur into the atmosphere last year, as well as 500,000
tonnes of nitrous oxides and nearly 200m tonnes of carbon dioxide. They also
passed nearly one sixth of Britain's fresh water through their cooling
systems - all to keep the lights burning.
Many people will be shocked by the sheer size of these figures. But they are
derived from the environmental performance reports which both companies have
just published for the first time. The two documents are part of the
electricity generation industry's efforts to put across their side of the
story, though they will doubtless be excused of trying to raise excuses.
The timing is fortuitous - or well planned. The reports came out only days
after PowerGen received permission to burn orimulsion, the controversial
bitumen-based fuel from Venezuela. They also coincide with the start of
fresh negotiations in Geneva to tighten targets for reducing European
atmospheric emissions, where Britain is likely once again to be tagged the
dirty man of Europe.
At one level, the reports are intended to be a source of information. They
contain details of the companies' environmental policies, of their emissions
and of the efforts they are making to bring them down. They also describe
the chain of command within the companies and their record of compliance
with the regulations.
The general thrust of the reports is that both companies have inherited very
dirty power stations from pre-privatisation days and are making strenuous
efforts to clean them up. Both companies claim to be well within the
pollution limits set by the government and to be on a downward path that
will enable them to meet the long-term targets set by international
agreements.
National Power, for example, reports emissions of 1.3m tonnes of sulphur
dioxide last year against a limit of 1.6m, but it has to halve those to
660,000 tonnes by the year 2003.
PowerGen, which has fewer power stations, produced just under 1m tonnes of
sulphur dioxide, or 100,000 tonnes less than its limit. It has to get those
down to 669,000 tonnes by 1998.
There are also details of emissions of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and
other forms of waste such as dust and ash.
At another level, however, the reports are intended to show that bringing
these emissions down is not merely a question of sticking clean-up equipment
on the top of chimneys. Both companies list a number of other options:
switching to cleaner fuels such as natural gas, building new types of power
generation plant, raising fuel efficiency and even getting their customers
to use less energy.
National Power says: 'We cannot change our existing generating assets
overnight. Our company strategy is to investigate all possible ways of
achieving our environmental and commercial targets and then to pursue the
most cost-effective solution.' NP goes on to hint that it would rather shut
down some of its older power stations than invest in costly clean-up
equipment.
In other words, the reports try to identify the balance between the benefits
of environmental protection and the cost. Between them, the two companies
expect to spend more than Pounds 3bn on various environmental improvements
during the 1990s, including building cleaner power stations. But as
privatised companies, they have a duty to their shareholders; green
considerations have to take the appropriate place, and these reports make
clear that profit comes first.
Ed Wallis, PowerGen's chief executive, sums up the debating point that the
generators want to get across: 'Achieving the most effective investment, in
terms of environmental protection and economics, is a challenge which we,
our regulators and the government continue to face.'
PowerGen's is the more readable of the two reports. Apart from the colour
pictures, it has informative diagrams on how pollution is caused (though the
words acid rain are studiously avoided).
It also includes a map showing the areas of Britain which are most sensitive
to atmospheric pollution. This so-called 'critical loads' approach is the
basis of government policy. It breaks down the country into a set of
squares, showing the ability of each to tolerate more pollution.
But National Power's report seems to be the more thorough. It gives more
overall detail. It also goes into the sensitive area of compliance. It
reveals, for example, that the company breached environmental regulations 29
times last year, though none resulted in prosecution. Possibly most
important, John Baker, chief executive, states he has personal
responsibility for environmental policy and compliance. It is not clear from
the PowerGen document which main board director has this responsibility,
though Wallis signs a personal introduction.
National Power also asked Lloyds Register to verify its report. LR found the
report presents 'a correct, true and fair picture'. But it points out that
NP's aim of 'doing better than compliance where appropriate' has yet to
materialise because of the company's focus on complying with the
requirements of the Environmental Protection Act, which are still coming
into force.
This point is taken up by Fiona Weir, a clean air campaigner at Friends of
the Earth. She criticises the NP report for being entirely
'compliance-driven'. Her complaint is that the targets for pollution
reduction are based on what the law requires, not on what the environment
can stand.
She says: 'This is not an environmental policy. This is about avoiding
breaking the law and avoiding wasting money.'
She would like to see the generators adopting an approach which aimed to
clean up the air and reduce acid rain to acceptable levels, regardless of
what the law required.
'These reports show the importance of legislation,' she says. 'Companies are
not driving environmental policy. Environmental policy is driving the
companies.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Linking cash with conservation
 -A wildlife scheme in Zimbabwe which is encouraging rural economic
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the elephant was voted the world's most popular animal, you can bet the
people of Hurungwe district in northern Zimbabwe were not consulted.
Every year, they live in fear of elephants trampling through fields of maize
that took months to prepare and tend. One night's feast for an elephant can
wipe out an entire year's harvest. Homes might be wrecked if situated in the
animals' paths. Children and adults are injured and sometimes killed.
Why, then, are villagers thinking of constructing water dams and putting
down salt to encourage elephants into their area? Why are they discouraging
illegal settlers so that their land might be used instead by elephants? The
answer lies in a novel programme which is giving economic value to elephants
and other wildlife on Zimbabwe's communal lands.
Under Campfire (Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous
Resources), rural communities are managing to make money from animals which
until recently were poached as pests. The programme is simultaneously
encouraging economic development and a conservation ethos in rural areas.
Campfire works by linking cash with conservation. Until recently, rural
communities were not allowed to make any use of wildlife on their lands  -
poaching was common, either for food or to stop animals destroying crops and
endangering people. Now, districts accepted into the programme are allowed
to shoot a certain number of animals every year, for sale either as meat or
safari trophies.
The programme - run by the government and conservation organisations - gives
rural communities a choice. They can shoot an animal that is damaging crops
and sell its meat, earning, for example, about Pounds 1,600 for an elephant;
or they can save the quota for safari hunting, where an elephant will earn
the community Pounds 4,000-Pounds 6,000. A typical annual wildlife quota per
district might include a variety of wildlife, such as seven elephants, 20
buffalo and 20 baboons.
Campfire is creating an additional source of income for subsistence farmers.
Last year, eight districts earned about Pounds 350,000 from safari hunting -
mostly from Americans keen to collect an elephant trophy.
Participating communities decide whether to invest the money in community
projects - such as schools, dams or grinding mills - or divide it among
households for personal use. In one ward, households earned Pounds 60 each
from Campfire last year - a welcome addition to the average annual income of
about Pounds 80.
The programme is also encouraging the spread of business skills. Local
Campfire committees are going into partnership with well-established safari
operators to market their quotas; community investments are creating
small-scale industries such as the grinding mills and bee-keeping; other
tourist ventures are under way, such as hiking and photographic safaris.
Cash and conservation are an attractive couple, says Lovemore Katena, a ward
councillor in Hurungwe district. 'The best thing about Campfire is that we
are learning to manage our resources and we benefit from them.'
The conservation benefits are becoming clear. Villagers involved are
actively discouraging wildlife poaching, confiscating snares, reporting
poaching incidents and guarding against bush fires which are used to flush
out animals but also destroy vegetation. They discourage illegal settlement
and illegal gold panning, which contribute to the destruction of the land,
rivers and vegetation.
Only firm evidence of the link between conservation and economic development
can maintain people's commitment to Campfire, says Cherry Bird, wildlife
co-ordinator for Hurungwe district. 'Everybody has to feel they are
benefiting tangibly from this programme so they'll be involved in management
decisions. It sounds idealistic, but the alternative is to have no
wildlife.'
The nomadic nature of wildlife is proving a problem. The community where an
animal is shot is the community that earns money - although several areas
may have suffered crop damage en route. There is, therefore, no guarantee of
a stable income from year to year. Some villagers argue they are being
bribed to put up with wildlife. Others want their quotas increased so they
can shoot more animals and earn more.
Nevertheless, districts are queueing up to be accepted into Campfire. By the
end of the year, 24 will have Campfire status and by 2000 more than half the
country is expected to be devoted to wildlife conservation under the
programme.
Elephants - which are not an endangered species in Zimbabwe - remain the
biggest earners under Campfire because of their status symbol to safari
hunters. The hope is that other community businesses will become equally
important to the local economies over time, says Ivan Bond, Campfire
research fellow at the World Wide Fund for Nature.
'In the long-term, Campfire principles will have to be applied holistically
to the whole range of natural resources. If the institutions exist for the
management of one common property resource, it should not be too difficult
to extend these to other resources.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / Management: Clearly, concisely and with feeling - Business
people should not allow their letters to be a write off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUPERT MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with business people is that they think they can write. Or, even
if they know they cannot, they dare not admit it.
But when I say someone cannot write, I am not branding them illiterate. All
I am saying is they do not do themselves justice on paper. Some of the most
entertaining people can transform themselves into plodding bureaucrats when
their words appear beneath a letter-heading.
I recently came across an engineering company that addressed its customers
as 'your goodselves'. And it was only a few years ago that my former bank
used to end its letters with: 'We have the honour to remain, sir, your
obedient servants.'
When the chief executive of my present bank wrote to his customers to assure
us of his personal readiness to respond to criticism, I took him up on the
offer. Since I teach effective writing, I also offered my help. The letter I
received came from the head of development and training operations - a title
that carried its own warning of impending verbosity.
Jones (not his real name) thanked me for my letter, and went on to explain:
'At this moment in time, the group continues to invest heavily in training
and development initiatives that contribute to the advancement of our
challenging business objectives. The development of employee potential is a
major focus of these programmes. Our leadership and management competence
training addresses a very wide range of personal management and leadership
skills development.'
All Jones means to say here is: 'The bank already runs training courses for
its staff.' But instead of a single sentence with a single verb and two or
three nouns, he wastes his time and mine employing between 20 and 25 nouns,
depending on whether you count nouns used adjectivally.
It takes him another two paragraphs to explain why he believes he has no
need of my services. 'Over the past few years we have built up a
comprehensive training infrastructure to support the diverse and changing
needs of our business. . .'
The point is not whether or not this kind of verbiage is to your taste. The
point is it does not do the job. If Jones wanted to give me the brush-off,
he could have done so politely in one or two concise sentences. And I would
not have bothered him again. As it was, I wrote back to the chief executive.
I received a letter from the Senior Manager, Customer Relations, thanking me
for my 'thoughtful thoughts', and acknowledging 'the need for us to better
train our people at a rapid rate'. His letter concluded: 'Should our ongoing
audits of our internal training effectiveness prove a need for your
company's input, we will let you know.'
I would say the need was pretty urgent, wouldn't you? This bank is not alone
in the inability of its employees and executives to communicate in writing.
I was conducting a writing course at one of Britain's leading accountancy
firms when I came across the following sentence: '(The firm) achieves a high
level of continuity on audits by using clear succession plans which
emphasise the importance of developing lasting relationships.'
I translated this as: 'The firm knows the importance of continuity. We will
not chop and change our auditing team.'
'Oh, no,' they said. 'We do not use words like 'chop' and 'change'. They
sound. . .well, almost slang.' And so it goes on.
Too many people in business dare not be clear. They dare not commit
themselves and do not want to sound over-familiar. We cannot be too careful,
they think. Paradoxically, such excessive care can be dangerous. When
obfuscation becomes a habit, communication suffers and, in due course, so
does the decision-making process.
There is a popular misconception that the written word is not a tool of
communication but a means of bolstering the image of your company or
department. Hence the proliferation of abstract nouns and vague phrases  -
such as 'a highly developed service network', 'an extensive client support
function', 'designed-in delivery flexibility' - that sound grand, mean next
to nothing and keep real people at arm's length.
Hence also the epitome of grandiosity for its own sake - the mission
statement. Robert Fritz, the US management guru, told a London audience last
month he had only seen two meaningful mission statements and one was from a
group of nuns.
Happily, there are exceptions. Tiny Rowland always made his annual report
statements to Lonrho shareholders pungent, intelligible and informative. And
when Sears made cuts last year, chief executive Liam Strong used his interim
report to explain the situation with exemplary frankness. Media and markets
reacted alike, impressed by the clarity of thinking. At a difficult moment
in the company's development, the share price rose.
Good business writing is not a mystical process, nor is it some rare gift.
It can be learnt. It springs from simple principles, such as identifying
your purpose, considering your reader and checking repeatedly for relevance.
But the first essential is recognising that bad writing springs from lazy
thinking. And that does require a rare quality - humility.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Islanders fear the effect of a dirty word: A Scots ferries
review may advise selling off a 'lifeline'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office yesterday named KPMG Management Consulting as the
consultants who are to report on subsidised ferry services to the Scottish
islands.
KPMG's remit includes the politically explosive task of considering the
possible privatisation of Caledonian MacBrayne, the state-owned shipping
company which operates on the west coast.
In May Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said he wanted to look at options
for 'private-sector participation' in services operated by Caledonian
MacBrayne, as well as review the subsidised shipping services to Orkney and
Shetland, where the biggest operator is P&amp;O Scottish Ferries.
The fact that the future of Caledonian MacBrayne was to be reviewed, for the
third time in a decade, with the explicit mention of privatisation as an
option, provoked uproar which has never really subsided.
Yesterday hundreds of people from all 23 west-coast islands served by its
ferries converged on Oban, one of the company's principal mainland ports, to
express their opposition to privatisation.
Mr Brian Wilson MP, a Labour transport spokesman, said: 'Islanders
understand quite clearly that privatisation could only mean higher fares and
loss of lifeline services.'
Although Mr Lang has stressed that he is committed to continuing subsidies
for 'lifeline' services, the phrase on many islanders' lips yesterday was
'cutting our lifeline'.
Caledonian MacBrayne operates ferries to the Hebridean islands and around
the Firth of Clyde, providing an essential service with its 32 ferries.
With privatisation a dirty word to many Scots and Caledonian MacBrayne being
anxious to carry on as before, the company is benefiting from a wave of
public affection and favourable media coverage.
'It's questionable if changes are in the interests of either the customers
or of the government,' said Mr Colin Paterson, CalMac's managing director.
'We think we are running services to the islands in the most economical
way.'
CalMac received a Scottish Office subsidy of Pounds 6m last year which
almost covered its loss of Pounds 6.2m on turnover of Pounds 33m. Mr
Paterson points out that the subsidy has steadily been falling as a
percentage of turnover and that the 1992 subsidy is smaller in both money
and real terms than that of 1983.
That was the year Mr Paterson arrived from North Sea Ferries to improve the
running of a company whose long-standing inefficiency had led it to be
called the curse of the Hebrides.
Since then, he said: 'We've brought the company into the 20th century'.
CalMac began to market its services to tourists. It started a big programme
of upgrading its fleet with newer and larger vessels.
Because of the increase in shipping capacity and services, and with the
growth in the economy of the islands, the number of passengers carried has
risen from 4.3m in 1983 to 6.3m last year, while the number of cars has
nearly doubled in that period to 1.3m.
The company says a subsidy continues to be necessary because it has to
operate uneconomic routes in winter as well as summer, and to service debt
on its substantial ship replacement programme.
The subsidy this financial year will rise by Pounds 1m to Pounds 7m to help
pay for a new ferry to the island of Arran. CalMac's subsidy is to be
boosted by a further Pounds 10.5m over three years to help pay for a new
ship for the Ullapool-Stornoway route.
Normally CalMac borrows long-term to pay for ships, with the interest rate
subsidised by the Department of Trade and Industry. It has occasionally
obtained capital grants for new ships. Some 40 per cent of one of the bigger
ferries, the Lord of the Isles, was paid for by the European Regional
Development Fund, while 75 per cent of the new ship for the
Ullapool-Stornoway route, costing more than Pounds 15m, will be paid for out
of a Scottish Office capital grant.
Observers in the shipping industry accept that CalMac is much more efficient
than it was but several believe the ready availability of subsidies has
given it a culture of solving problems by throwing money at them.
'CalMac has no incentive to save on vessels so it produces grandiloquent
ships which require large crews,' said Mr Andrew Wilson, a director of
Western Ferries. His company is almost the only direct competitor CalMac
has, operating profitably between Gourock and Dunoon on the Clyde against a
lossmaking CalMac service.
For 13 years until 1981 it operated a successful service to the island of
Islay, before having to withdraw after being, it said, undercut by the
subsidised CalMac service.
'It's a flabby operation,' said a west-coast businessman with experience of
operating ferries. 'Several of the islands would be better served by more
small ships rather one big one.'
Mr Paterson admits that only three of CalMac's routes make a positive
contribution to the company's finances: the short crossing of the Kyle of
Lochalsh to Skye (which will end when the Skye bridge opens in 1995); the
route from Ullapool to Stornoway in Lewis and the Oban-to-Mull service.
He said: 'It is essential that CalMac is kept as a single entity so that the
profitable routes can subsidise the unprofitable ones. If it was broken up
and private operators were allowed in they would take on the profitable
routes and keep the profits. The government would then have to spend more on
subsidies for the unprofitable ones.'
Mr Andrew Wilson said: 'There are plenty of ways in which ferry services can
be organised which would produce better services for the islands and a
smaller burden for the taxpayer. But . . . I don't expect the report will
lead to any change.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / GEC 'had agreed to buy' Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC HAD agreed to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, before it went
into receivership in May.
But the draft agreement signed between the two companies lapsed when Swans
failed to win a contract to build a helicopter carrier for the Royal Navy,
Price Waterhouse, Swans' receiver, said yesterday. The contract went instead
to VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. After a fruitless 24-hour search for
another backer, Swan Hunter called in the receiver.
Since then 19 interested parties have contacted Price Waterhouse, which
wants to sell Swan Hunter as a going concern. It said talks were continuing
but details were commercially sensitive.
In its first report to creditors, Price Waterhouse also confirmed that
unsecured creditors of the company were 'unlikely' to salvage anything from
its crash.
A creditors' meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne heard that the company had debts
of more than Pounds 40m. Its assets had a book value of Pounds 39.2m, but a
sale would realise only Pounds 6.3m, said the receiver.
Some Pounds 27.7m is owed to secured creditors - Pounds 12.2m in loans from
Lloyds Bank and Pounds 15.5m owed to the General Surety and Guarantee
Company. The Pounds 15.5m is the face value of bonds provided to the
Ministry of Defence to ensure the completion of three Type 23 frigates.
The receiver said Pounds 5.2m owed to preferential creditors in tax and
national insurance, holiday pay, wages and pension contributions would be
paid.
Swan Hunter's management accounts showed a Pounds 1.6m profit in the first
six months of the year, reversing two years of losses totalling Pounds 26m.
The shipyard's financial problems had been cited by Mr Jonathan Aitken,
defence procurement minister, as contributing to the company's failure to
put forward a low enough bid for the contract. At the time Swan Hunter went
into receivership, 90 per cent of its business was with the Ministry of
Defence for the construction of the three Type 23 frigates.
VSEL has said it wants to take over these contracts and finish the work on
Tyneside. The receiver indicated this would not satisfy the desire to sell
Swans as a going concern.

<TEXT>
THE PENSIONS ombudsman found in favour of 78 per cent of complainants in
cases investigated in 1992-93, compared with only 46 per cent the previous
year.
The ombudsman was able to resolve only 59 out of 2,166 complaints received
because most either fell outside his jurisdiction or were not appropriate
for investigation.
Mr Michael Platt was delivering the second annual report since the office
was established early in 1991.
'It is interesting that I found in favour of such a high proportion of cases
but I cannot say whether this is a trend or a one-year blip,' he said. He
found wholly in favour of the complainant in 27 cases, and in part in
another 19 cases. In the previous year he upheld 22 cases wholly or in part
in favour of the complainant, out of the 47 cases investigated by his
office.
The number of complaints received in the year showed only a small drop on
the 2,186 received the previous year. Mr Platt said that this probably
represented a real increase given the pent-up demand in the first year.
Some 27 per cent of complaints received last year fell outside his
jurisdiction. In 28 per cent, investigation was not thought appropriate
because of lack of evidence of injustice due to maladministration or because
transfer values, while low, had been calculated correctly along actuarial
guidelines. Some complaints fell outside the three-year time limit set by
the ombudsman's scheme.
Mr Platt referred almost 40 per cent of the complaints to the Occupational
Pensions Advisory Service, a quasi-governmental body which provides free
advice to those with pension problems. Complainants are expected first to
exhaust the complaints procedure of their scheme and then to go to the
advisory service which refers complaints it cannot resolve to the ombudsman.
The majority of complaints were about maladministration. Others regarded
transfer values, where operators of the pension scheme delayed giving a
transfer quotation or making the transfer payment.
Mr Platt's advice to operators was: 'Get it right and get it right quickly.'
Scheme members, for their part, should be vigilant and not be fobbed off
with explanations that they did not understand, he said.
The highest compensation payout instructed by the ombudsman was Pounds 2,800
last year but most were between Pounds 100 and Pounds 250.
Mr Platt also referred to the increasing complexity of cases, which slowed
down investigations. The average probe took 10 months, compared with seven
months the previous year. Mr Platt said he was unhappy with this and had
instituted a screening procedure to let people know within weeks whether
their case would be taken up.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Markets yet to be convinced on inflation habit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS winning the battle on inflation, but is some way from winning the
war. That was the message yesterday from the Bank of England, which said
that in spite of low price pressures financial markets have yet to be
convinced that the UK has kicked its inflation habit.
The Bank says in the inflation report in its quarterly bulletin that the
Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation is unlikely to breach
the government's 4 per cent ceiling in the next two years. This measure
defines underlying inflation as the year-on-year rise in the retail prices
index excluding mortgage payments.
But the Bank adds that expectations in financial markets are not 'consistent
with the achievement of the inflation target over the next decade'. It also
warns that inflationary pressures could revive if the government fails to
take tough action to bring down the rising budget deficit, which is likely
to reach about Pounds 50bn this financial year.
The Bank's central forecast is that underlying inflation should reach just
over 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1995. It has reduced its inflation
forecasts slightly since the last inflation report in May. Demonstrating the
margin for error, the Bank says that underlying inflation in early 1995
could go as high as about 5 per cent or as low as 2 per cent.
The underlying inflation in June stood at 2.8 per cent, after 3.5 per cent
in March. Mirroring the decline in this figure has been a fall in 'headline'
inflation, as measured by the RPI. This came down to a year-on-year 1.2 per
cent in June, the lowest figure for nearly 30 years. Average earnings across
the economy rose 3.75 per cent in the year to May, a 26-year low. The Bank
reckons that earnings growth will stay subdued during the next year, partly
because of high short-term unemployment. According to Bank estimates the
proportion of people out of work for a year or less is about 7 per cent, a
higher figure than at any time during the 1980s (see charts).
While in May investors in gilt-edged securities were expecting inflation in
2010 to be about 5.5 per cent, in recent weeks this figure has come down by
about 0.5 percentage points. Even so, the Bank says long-term gilt yields
are still high, suggesting that investors 'either require a very large
premium to compensate for uncertainty about future inflation' or are
unconvinced that future governments will stick to the inflation target.
By early next year the Treasury's measure for underlying inflation is likely
to move up slightly as the switch from the poll tax to the less expensive
council tax drops out of the RPI calculations. Together with the tax
increases due to take effect next April, these changes will push up
underlying inflation by 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of next
year and by 0.4 points in the second quarter.
The Bank also comes up with another method - the RPI excluding not only
mortgage payments but also local taxation and excise duties and VAT - for
monitoring underlying inflation. It suggests this might be more useful than
the Treasury measure. On this basis, underlying inflation 'is expected to
decline until the middle of 1994 and then remain roughly constant'. All the
Bank's forecasts assume base rates staying at 6 per cent and an unchanged
exchange rate.
The projections could be thrown off course by a further depreciation in
sterling, which could affect prices by pushing up import costs. The Bank
says April's appreciation in sterling, which followed the 15 per cent fall
in the exchange rate last September after Britain's exit from the exchange
rate mechanism, was 'welcome'.
Other factors which could trigger higher inflation might include companies
or wage bargainers pushing up profits or pay levels in an attempt to regain
ground lost during the recession. Helping inflationary remain low is that
the labour market is still slack even after the surprise 83,100 fall in
unemployment since the beginning of the year.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Contest for EC funds considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may force local authorities and local economic development
agencies to enter formal competitions for European Community regional funds.
The Department of Trade Industry said yesterday it was considering such a
scheme for the funds, which are to help areas of industrial decline and
urban deprivation, but added: 'It is just an idea that's being looked at, at
the moment.'
The idea, however, has been discussed for several months and owes its
origins to City Challenge, a competition devised in 1991 by Mr Michael
Heseltine, when he was environment secretary.
Local private- and public-sector partnerships were invited to bid for the
funding of regeneration programmes concentrated on a specific urban area.
Any new competition would be for what the EC calls Objective Two funds,
flowing from Brussels between 1994 and 1996.
Although local authorities have already started lobbying Whitehall in the
hope of obtaining support for inclusion on the map of eligible areas, the
European Commission will not finalise the map until the autumn.
Between 1989 and 1993 the EC provided Pounds 229m of Objective Two funding
for the UK. Local authorities made bids for use of the money through the UK
government but bids did not always reach the total sum available from
Brussels.
This was because the government, to the anger of the Commission, would
simply deduct a sum equivalent to the EC funding from its planned grants to
a local authority.
The government now has greater scope to stage a competition because it has
agreed to abide by the EC rules of providing funding to match any EC grant.
This makes the funding more attractive to local authorities.
Past practice suggests that government rules for any competition are likely
to lay emphasis on, and give funding preference to, partnerships between the
private and the public sector. But the rules will have to be approved by the
Commission.
The DTI will handle the negotiations with the Commission but the Department
of Environment will administer any competition and disburse the funds for
the EC.

PROPERTY Holdings, the arm of the Department of the Environment that acts as
the government's landlord, yesterday announced two property deals as part of
its freehold acquisitions programme.
It has bought a 300,000 sq ft office development at Victoria Quay in Leith,
Lothian. It is being developed by a joint venture between Forth Ports, the
original site owners, and Mr Godfrey Bradman, the property entrepreneur.
The building will provide space for 1,400 staff and be occupied by the
Scottish Office, now based in Edinburgh.
The department has also paid Pounds 21m for the landlord's interest in a
building in Northgate, Glasgow, which it had leased until 2013 for the
Passport Office Agency and the Benefits Agency. It was sold by Witan
Investment Company, an investment trust.

THE NUMBER of people on hospital waiting lists has topped a million for the
first time.
Provisional Department of Health statistics published yesterday show 22,789
people joined waiting lists in the three months to the end of June, when the
total reached 1,017,763. Over that period hospital waiting lists of people
waiting more than a year for treatment grew by 15.7 per cent to 65,465.
But Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said the figures showed the number
of patients waiting more than a year for treatment was down by 17,000

FT  11 AUG 93 / Muted welcome for 'green' farm reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIONISTS gave a qualified welcome to a Pounds 30m package of
government measures unveiled yesterday to encourage farmers to preserve the
countryside and allow greater public access to their land.
Under the proposals, announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture
minister, the number of areas in England designated as 'environmentally
sensitive' would rise from 16 to 22, covering a total of 1.15m hectares, or
10 per cent of England's agricultural land.
Farmers would be paid for managing land in these areas in environmentally
friendly ways such as cutting the number of sheep grazing it or maintaining
hedgerows.
The proposals have been sent to the European Commission for approval under
the Agri-Environment Regulation that accompanied reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy last year and required member states to come up with
ways of rewarding farmers for looking after the countryside.
The other new measures, all designed to take effect next year, include a
moorland protection scheme, a scheme to create or improve wildlife habitats,
further protection of drinking water sources from fertiliser nitrates,
financial incentives for organic farming, and plans for greater public
access to land left fallow.
The government has already responded to conservationists' concerns by
changing the rules on rotational set-aside last month to protect wildlife
from damage when fallow fields are cut or ploughed for re-sowing.
Mr Paul Wynne, land use officer for the Council for the Protection of Rural
England, said the new measures are 'a small but positive step.
'However, much more money should be allocated to positive management of the
countryside. This could be achieved by shifting resources away from wasteful
schemes like set-aside, which pays farmers to lay land idle at a cost to the
UK taxpayer of Pounds 150m every year, to environmental schemes which reward
farmers positively for looking after the countryside.'
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the habitat scheme could
create 8,000 hectares of new habitat for wildlife each year. 'There are some
extremely good things here,' said Mr John Taylor, head of policy research.
Valuable wildlife habitats on land left fallow under the five-year voluntary
set-aside scheme just ended could now be saved from the plough, thanks to
proposed payments to farmers of Pounds 275 per hectare per year to keep it
out of production for 20 years, he said.
However, some planned payments, for example to sheep farmers reducing the
size of flocks on moorland, were too low to work, he said.
The new environmentally sensitive areas will be in the Blackdown Hills in
Devon, the Cotswolds, Dartmoor, the Essex Coast, the Upper Thames
tributaries and the Shropshire hills. They will account for the largest
proportion of spending, set to reach Pounds 30m by 1995-96.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has given the go-ahead for England's first three 'community
forests', which are designed to improve the landscape and give town dwellers
access to leisure activities on their doorstep.
The forests are a joint initiative by the Countryside Commission and the
Forestry Commission, which have been working with local authorities.
The forests will be called Thames Chase, near South Ockenden, east of
London; the Forest of Mercia, in south Staffordshire; and the Great North
Forest, in Tyne and Wear.
The government has approved the Countryside Commission's business plans for
the forests. Some planting has begun and grants will be available from the
Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture.
It could take 40 years for the forests, which will be a blend of woodland,
farmland and open space, to be established fully. Nine more forests are
under consideration.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Cross-border alliances between banks fell last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of cross-border alliances formed between European banks and
financial services companies fell last year as the French banks, which have
been the most active in such deals, were affected by recession, John Gapper
writes.
A bulletin article analysing 247 cross-border financial alliances over the
past six years finds that 74 partnerships were initiated by French companies
against 36 by UK companies and 35 by German.
The most common form of alliance came from large companies buying stakes in
smaller ones. Outright acquisitions or the purchase of a majority stake
accounted for 46 per cent of deals, and joint ventures only 8 per cent.
German and UK institutions favoured buying entire business units or majority
stakes, while most French and Italian ventures took minority stakes.
Last year French alliances dropped from 23 to three. Deals by UK companies
fell to two from a consistent rate of between six and nine a year.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Airport retail space expected to jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPPING space in British airports could increase sharply, a report by
property advisers Chesterton says.
The UK's 15 largest airports could support a further 250,000 sq ft of retail
space by 2000, the report says, increasing their total shopping space to
nearly 600,000 sq ft - equal to a large shopping centre.
The report says retailing is playing an increasingly important role in
British airports as they face up to new opportunities and pressures.
These include increasing numbers of passengers, loss of duty-free income
after June 1999 and stiffer competition between European airports for
profitable long-haul flights.
The potential for growth is greatest at Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle,
which have 30 per cent more passengers per shop than the national average of
400 passengers per shop.
Airports are attractive to retailers because they have a captive market of
passengers waiting for flights.
The report says: 'There is a growing realisation that air passengers and
other visitors represent an affluent and willing customer base, and that
flight schedules give a unique insight into potential customer
characteristics.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / Spoonful of sugar for drugs sector: Paul Abrahams explains
why a 2.5% price cut is letting the industry off lightly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS GROUPS are becoming accustomed to receiving bad news about prices.
Cuts in Germany and Italy this year have brought the European market, which
expanded last year by 10 per cent, to a sudden halt.
Yesterday it was the turn of the UK to announce a 2.5 per cent cut, which
will add to the industry's woes. But the impact of the measures, for most
groups, is unlikely to be significant.
Britain has a small market in pharmaceuticals, worth Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds
3.28bn) last year, less than either Italy or Spain. The French and German
markets were each worth Dollars 12bn in 1992, according to IMS
International, the market research company.
Few companies are heavily exposed to the UK market. Glaxo, Europe's largest
drugs company, generates 10 per cent of its sales in Britain. Zeneca's UK
turnover represents 7 per cent of sales. At Wellcome it is 6.5 per cent and
at SmithKline Beecham it is about 5 per cent.
For non-UK groups, the significance of the British market is even less.
Merck, the world's biggest group, generates only 0.5 per cent of its drugs
sales in the UK, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US's second-biggest group,
only 0.2 per cent.
The UK market is not only small, but the price cut is far less than had been
feared. 'We had been expecting something far more draconian. There had been
talk of cuts of up to 6 per cent,' said Mr Duncan Moore, pharmaceuticals
analyst at brokers Morgan Stanley.
The cut is certainly far less dramatic than that in Germany, where a package
that included a 5 per cent reduction in prices sent the market into sharp
reverse, dropping 11 per cent during the first five months this year. In
Italy, health reforms introduced in April led to a decline of 1.8 per cent
over the same period.
Industry concerns that there would be a cut in the maximum return on capital
governed by the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme have proved
unfounded. The scheme controls drugs groups' profitability. The limit is
being kept to between 17 per cent and 21 per cent.
So why does Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, appear to have let the
industry off so lightly? After all, the UK government is facing the same
problems of rapidly rising healthcare bills as those elsewhere. Around the
globe, health spending is spinning out of control as populations age and
technology becomes more advanced and expensive.
Although it represents only about 10 per cent of NHS spending, the drugs
budget is increasing rapidly. NHS drug purchases rose by 14 per cent last
year, far more than the rate of inflation. The Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry is quick to point out that prices contributed
nothing to that growth.
One reason for Mrs Bottomley's apparent generosity is that she may be
concerned about the impact of reforms on the health of the drugs industry.
It is one of the UK's few technological success stories and creates
significant revenues for the UK, even generating a trade surplus with Japan.
The problem faced by the government is to balance the need to save money on
drugs with the requirement to provide adequate treatment for patients while
protecting an important strategic industry.
However, more likely is that Mrs Bottomley has other, more flexible, ways of
controlling drugs spending. British doctors are already intensely
conservative prescribers of medicines. Each year British doctors sign 7.6
prescriptions a head compared with French doctors who fill in 38 and Italian
doctors who sign 20. The Department of Health is encouraging such parsimony
by introducing indicative budgets for general practitioners.
Mrs Bottomley's department is also negotiating with the industry over the
introduction of blacklists of products for which the NHS will no longer pay.
These involve 10 therapeutic categories, including oral contraceptives and
skin treatments.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American group, this week announced it was
cutting the price of a sleeping pill called Zimavane by 82 per cent in an
effort to keep off the blacklist, and warned that other companies would have
to follow its example.
Mr Klaus Behrendt, director of pharmaceuticals at Bayer's UK operations, is
warning that the blacklists could be extended to all medicines. The industry
has won one drugs price battle, but it is unlikely to win the war.

<TEXT>
LABOUR is to create a powerful new class of area organisers in an attempt to
improve its chances of winning Conservative-held marginal seats at the next
general election.
The move is being financed from savings in head office expenses following a
review of the party's structure and finances led by Mr John Evans, MP for St
Helens North.
Labour officials say the expansion will have no effect on the party's hopes
of breaking even by next year. Its overdraft has fallen to Pounds 1.7m this
year from Pounds 2.7m after the 1992 general election.
By contrast, the Conservative party has lost 20 per cent of its constituency
agents since the election, and is struggling with a Pounds 19m overdraft.
Most of Labour's new organisers will be in the midlands and northern
England, where Labour is keen to improve on its performance last year. In
particular, it is targeting Conservative-held marginal seats in the north -
especially Yorkshire.
Four of the new posts will be in the south, where Labour is fighting off a
strong challenge from the Liberal Democrats to be the Tories' main rival.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Valleys welcome falls on deaf ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY ENGLISH company executives remain unconvinced by male-voice choirs
pledging a warm welcome in the hillsides and valleys of Wales.
A survey of 500 company directors based in the south of England shows that
more than a third believe that the Welsh are anything but welcoming to
people moving in from over the border.
The survey, by Cardiff-based SRD Consultants, suggests that while south
Wales has been successful in attracting inward investment from overseas it
has yet to convince many 'foreigners' closer to home to set up shop in the
principality.
A quarter of English company executives said that their children would be
disadvantaged by being brought up in Wales. More than half said the range of
facilities available to families were below the standards in England.
'It is just such considerations that could lead to Wales losing its
competitive edge in company relocation and new investment decisions,' said
Mr John Smith, former Labour MP for Vale of Glamorgan, and campaign manager
for Gwent Image, a partnership between the public and private sectors. Gwent
Image is dedicated to sweeping away the old image of coal-black terraces and
endless tips and promoting a more positive, modern image.
He said that although many English businesspeople had crossed the border and
happily settled, perceptions of remoteness, run-down industries and
unfriendly communities prevented many others from joining them.
Mr Smith added: 'We are making great strides in remedying the first two
factors. People are beginning to appreciate that industrial sites have been
cleaned up and that south Wales is just across the Severn Bridge.
'But we have to work on convincing potential business investors that the
Welsh are friendly and welcoming.'
Gwent is about to begin a promotional campaign aimed at attracting
investment. More than 1m letters will be sent to potential immigrants. It
could be an uphill struggle - 42 per cent of businesspeople surveyed did not
even know where Gwent is.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Directors' pay-offs fuel fears of overcompensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS' salary is the normal lump-sum pay-off to executives on the
standard three-year rolling contract who are sacked from their jobs, figures
published yesterday by Incomes Data Services show.
This will add weight to shareholders' fears that directors are
overcompensated for leaving companies, even in circumstances where they have
performed poorly.
The survey looked at 20 large companies which have recently made severance
payments to top executives.
It found that in most cases the sum was arrived at after careful
consultation with lawyers. Companies frequently made awards generous enough
to discourage directors from suing for breach of contract.
The pay-offs surveyed range from Pounds 785,000 to Pounds 55,000, although
the latter payment did not take account of up to Pounds 240,000 in
consultancy payments.
Some companies also gave compensation for loss of expected bonus payments,
pensions and mortgage subsidies, the survey found.
In most cases compensation was based on an assessment of the damages that a
court might award, taking into account the term of the service agreement,
the age of the director, the chances of that director finding a new job, and
a discount for immediate payment.
The Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the few companies in the survey that
had the same terms of severance pay for executives and other employees,
based on a simple calculation relating to years of service.
Earlier this year Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the
UK's largest pension fund, wrote to the FTSE 100 companies criticising
three-year rolling contracts, and proposing instead rolling contracts of no
more than one year.
Responding to this and other attacks from the press and shareholders,
companies in the survey said that in future severance payments would
probably become more modest.
One company said that its contracts would include a statement saying that no
director would get more than one year's salary as a pay-off, especially if
the reasons for leaving were associated with poor performance.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Funding gap 'threatens BR sell-off'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LACK OF investment in British Rail threatens the privatisation of the
network, the rail users' statutory watchdog said yesterday.
Major General Lennox Napier, chairman of the Central Transport Consultative
Committee, said: 'BR is under-invested, struggling to maintain service
levels, shedding resources, and staff morale is not high.'
Presenting the committee's annual report he said the gap between the
available funding and what BR needed was 'becoming unbridgeable'. BR's
external financing limit for passenger businesses in 1993-94 was set at
Pounds 706m, compared with Pounds 1.2bn the previous year, leaving the
network 'once again seriously short of funds'.
Passenger services could begin to break down. 'Some passengers could find
themselves travelling in older, shorter, less frequent and more crowded
trains,' he said. Rails, ballast and signalling were getting old but there
was no money to maintain infrastructure. This would result in short-term
service reductions and speed restrictions.
If privatisation was to have any chance of success, there were two
overriding requirements: a high and sustained level of investment, and
continuation of all the advantages of one co-ordinated network - including
through-ticketing, a national timetable and information systems, and general
acceptance of railcards and discounted fares.
The committee also warned that market forces would not work in the passenger
interest, and said the test of whether privatisation would be successful was
the extent to which passengers were protected from backdoor fare increases.
The price of private-sector involvement should not be paid by passengers
through higher fares and loss of network benefits. It called on the
government to require private operators to participate in existing fare
schemes and keep price rises broadly in line with inflation.
The committee said this year's fare rises of up to 10 per cent amounted to
exploitation of BR's monopoly.
A backlog of essential repairs was storing up problems, with many essential
schemes stalled because conventional sources of funding were inadequate. It
warned that the 'investment hiatus' could continue after privatisation as
franchising arrangements might encourage franchisees to bid for the lowest
possible subsidy.
Punctuality and reliability varied considerably last year. InterCity's
record - although slightly improved this year with 84.3 per cent of trains
less than 10 minutes late - was still below target. On the Kent coast and
Thames routes, the record was 'dismal'. Only the Gatwick Express surpassed
its punctuality target.
Overcrowding had worsened on some lines in spite of a fall in London
commuter volumes. Area committees recorded a 13 per cent increase in
passengers' complaints to 9,471 - the 11th consecutive yearly increase.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Businesses angry at maternity cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS' and women's organisations reacted angrily yesterday to a
government announcement that businesses would have to meet all costs of
improvements to maternity benefits required by a European Community
directive.
A consultation document issued by the Department of Social Security puts the
cost to employers of increased benefits at Pounds 55m-Pounds 75m a year,
excluding the administrative expenses of implementing the changes.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, described the additional burden
on employers as 'relatively small - Pounds 190 or Pounds 290 per expectant
working mother'.
The Institute of Directors said business and women would be the main losers.
Business should not have to pay what was essentially a social cost.
Dr Ann Robinson, IoD policy unit head, said: 'The extra cost involved in
employing women of childbearing age could handicap their employment
prospects.'
Ms Jenny Earle, legal officer of The Maternity Alliance, a group covering a
number of women's organisations, unions and charities, said the 'state
should provide the statutory minimum, with a top-up to full pay being
provided by employers'.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's spokesperson on women's issues, said: 'This is
a minimalist approach proposed by a mean-minded government.' One in five
women would continue to have no rights whatsoever to statutory maternity
pay.
Under current rules employers are reimbursed fully for the statutory 18
weeks of maternity pay they give workers. Mr Lilley put forward two options
for improvements to the scheme. The first would meet the minimum EC
requirements by improving benefits for 14 weeks and keep them at the present
rates for the other four weeks. The second option would increase benefits
for the whole of the 18 weeks.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Warning on radio advert revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL RADIO needs to increase total advertising revenue by at least 50
per cent to meet the planned increase in the number of new stations,
according to a report from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
In order to fund the growing number of commercial radio services, the report
says, the sector will need to achieve a 3 per cent share of total
advertising revenue. In 1992, it brought in Pounds 140m in advertising
revenue - an overall share of 2 per cent.
It says there will be 180 commercial local and regional services as well as
three national stations by 1996.
The report adds: 'It is essential to the future profitability of independent
radio that the increase in listening share is accompanied by an increase in
revenue share. Unless this is accomplished the industry will be in trouble
by 1996.'
The radio industry needs to overturn indifference from advertising agencies
towards the medium.
Coopers believes this will be helped by the growth in audiences, by the
launch of national stations, by advertising sales packages such as National
Network Radio and by the Radio Advertising Bureau which is promoting
commercial radio.
Mr George Eccles of Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday he believed the 3 per
cent share was possible, and was 'essential to the future profitability of
independent radio'.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Docklands body wins legal aid ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Docklands Development Corporation made legal history yesterday
when it became the first defendant to be given leave by the High Court to
challenge the granting of legal aid to people suing it for damages.
The corporation can now seek judicial review of the Legal Aid Board's
decision to grant aid to 800 residents claiming compensation for noise and
dust pollution and interference with television reception arising from the
docklands redevelopment.
Legal aid was granted to the residents in November 1991 and extended in
January this year to allow writs to be issued against the corporation, the
Docklands Light Railway, and Olympia &amp; York, the developers of Canary Wharf.
The residents claim the unprecedented level of construction work resulted in
a reduction in the quality of life and loss of enjoyment of both homes and
community.
Ms Sally Moore, a partner of Leigh Day &amp; Co, the London solicitors
representing the residents, said: 'This is an unprecedented step for a
defendant to take when faced with the prospect of being sued by a legally
aided party.'
The corporation made an unsuccessful attempt in 1991 to persuade the Legal
Aid Board not to grant aid to the residents. Now it says the board's
decision should be set aside because it did not look at each case
individually. If the High Court agrees, all the cases would have to be
reconsidered by the board.
The corporation's action would delay the hearing of the residents' case, Ms
Moore said. She also said a decision in the corporation's favour could have
profound consequences for other legal aid cases.

electors who do not want a Labour win and 5 per cent a Liberal Democrat win.
The poll puts Labour as the most popular party at 40 per cent with the
Tories and Liberal Democrats both on 28 per cent. Since last month Labour
has fallen two points, the Tories are the same and the Liberal Democrats

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCO British, subsidiary of US oil company Atlantic Richfield, was fined
Pounds 250,000 yesterday over the 1988 Ocean Odyssey accident in the North
Sea in which a radio operator died.
The company, which operated the rig, admitted two charges at the High Court
in Aberdeen under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Odeco Drilling (UK),
the rig's owner, was fined a total of Pounds 25,000 after pleading guilty to
two similar charges and another under the Mineral Workings (Offshore
Installations) Act.
The accident happened when the well being drilled by the Ocean Odyssey went
out of control and exploded. The court heard that Timothy Williams died in
the confusion of evacuation when he was left behind. He had been in a
lifeboat but had been recalled to establish radio communication with the
shore. A total of 66 people were rescued.

A CLAMPDOWN on dole fraud last year netted the government Pounds 44.7m, the

In 250,000-plus investigations during 1992-93, more than 61,100 people
withdrew their benefit claims, while 2,602 claimants and 55 employers were
prosecuted.
In one operation at London's Heathrow airport more than 100 minicab drivers
were caught, while 550 seaside workers in Wales withdrew claims after an
investigation.
The department says it is identifying more cases of collusion by employers,
who encourage workers to claim unemployment benefits while paying low wages.
The practice is particularly prevalent in textiles, construction and
agriculture.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'This behaviour gives
unscrupulous employers an unfair advantage over their competitors. Their
workforce claim benefits, and so are paid lower wages. It is unfair
competition, an example of how the black economy corrodes the fabric of our
society.'
The Department of Employment has estimated that about 8 per cent of
unemployment claims may be fraudulent, amounting to some Pounds 500m. This
year it has no financial target for savings but aims to have 63,000 claims
withdrawn by the end of the financial year.
Last year's operations, which grossed Pounds 71.1m, cost the department
Pounds 26.4m. It says it saved Pounds 2.69 for every Pounds 1 invested.
'Travelling' fraud, whereby claimants sign on in one area and work in
another, is on the increase, according to the department.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Welsh companies at risk as mail strike continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY SMALL companies in south Wales are on the verge of closure and
bankruptcy as a result of the eight-day Royal Mail dispute in Cardiff, which
has led to well over 1m letters being undelivered.
'Some businesses are at a virtual standstill,' said Mr Graham Hall, chief
executive of the Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry, last night. 'Cash
flow is affected, they are not getting orders or cheques in their post and
in some cases legal action will be brought by suppliers outside south Wales
who are unaware that their letters are being held up by the strike.'
Mr Hall said that the chamber was trying to press the Post Office and the
Union of Communication Workers to end the strike. 'Businesses outside the
area are not aware of the dispute and are still sending letters to Cardiff
companies and do not realise why they are not getting any response.'
He warned that courier services and transport companies were 'extremely
busy' as a result of the strike and the sale of fax machines was soaring.
'When the dispute is over companies will not all revert to using the post,'
he said.
Further talks are to be held today to try to end the strike, over new work
rosters. After a four-hour meeting yesterday, a union executive said that
negotiations had 'reached a critical stage' and called on the management to
honour an agreement to apply new fixed rosters 'in the fairest possible
way'.
The 900 striking workers will be ballotted on a peace formula when one
emerges. But prolonged talks between the Post Office and union national
officials have so far failed to secure agreement.

FT  11 AUG 93 / GM subsidiary calls back cars with fault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Saturn subsidiary of General Motors has recalled all 352,767 cars it
built before April 14 because of a wiring problem which has caused at least
34 vehicles to catch fire.
The subsidiary, set up in 1990 to build compact cars so as to compete with
imports from Japan and Europe, said it had written to owners warning them of
the defect and telling them to take their vehicles back to their dealers for
repair.
The modification is expected by analysts to cost the company about Dollars
8m (Pounds 5.3m), although Saturn refused to confirm the figure.
The problem is thought to be small in comparison with the controversy that
has surrounded GM's pick-up trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks, of which
more than 4m have been sold. GM, which has offered owners Dollars 1,000 each
towards the cost of a new vehicle, continues to deny design faults with the
pick-up trucks.
Unlike the pick-up truck case, Saturn said it had received no claims for
death or injury resulting from the fault, and that it had not been ordered
to recall the vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
The problem is in the wiring leading from the car's generator. It will be
replaced with a fuseable link which will trip in the event of overheating.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Clinton turns to health after budget bruising: The president
has still to make difficult decisions on healthcare reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday signed the US budget bill, voted through
Congress by a whisker last week. With opinion polls showing widespread
public distrust of the budget's measures, White House officials admit they
have a large marketing job to do to win support for the package.
But already the administration is preparing for the next items on its
legislative agenda, for when Congress returns in September. Heading the list
are plans for legislation on crime and welfare, and Vice-President Al Gore's
report on 'reinventing government', a compendium of suggestions on how to
make the federal government more efficient and less wasteful.
The biggest task facing Mr Clinton, however, is healthcare reform.
The president is making no attempt to underplay the size of the undertaking.
Speaking in West Virginia this week, he described the issue as the greatest
threat to economic security, and to the personal security of most American
families.
'Unless we reform the healthcare system of this country, we can never get
the deficit down to zero,' he warned.
The Clinton health plan, already much delayed by recognition that it stood
no chance of progress in Congress until the budget had been dealt with, has
still not been finalised.
The plan outlined by a taskforce headed by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, the
president's wife, is based on the managed competition approach. This
involves setting up health purchasing co-operatives to bring more bargaining
power to bear on pricing by doctors and hospitals. It would guarantee
universal insurance coverage, although not necessarily at once, and compel
employers to provide cover for their workers.
Difficult details have still to be decided: the degree of government control
over medical prices, the precise illnesses and treatments to be covered by
insurance, and the extent to which companies would be compelled to join
co-operatives in buying insurance for their employees.
Most troublesome is a congressional Budget Office estimate that pure managed
competition would increase national healthcare spending.
The report found, on the other hand, that a comprehensive government-run
health insurance system, similar to Canada's, would produce big savings,
bolstering the substantial minority of Democrats in Congress who favour this
single payer approach.
Bruised from the budget battle, Mr Clinton cannot relish the prospect of
arguing for further tax increases to pay for his health plan, even if White
House officials insist the reforms will cost money only over the short term.
Higher taxes on tobacco, and possibly other 'sins' such as alcohol and guns,
appear to be a relatively uncontroversial way of footing some of the bill.
Payroll taxes will be less popular in Congress.
If the Democrats in Congress are divided over the president's plan, so too
are the Republicans.
Mr Clinton needs at least a handful of Republican votes to avert the threat
of a filibuster in the Senate, and stands a good chance of winning it.
Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who has been his party's leading
spokesman on health issues, favours a managed competition approach which
bears striking similarities to elements of the Clinton plan.
Several centrist Republicans are also anxious to shed the obstructionist
image they fear they could earn if they systematically oppose everything Mr
Clinton tries to do.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, has so far
favoured the tactics of all-out opposition, preferring not to be outflanked
on his right by rivals such as Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas right-winger
who is angling for his party's presidential nomination in 1996. Some of Mr
Dole's friends in Congress believe, however, that his legislative instincts
will eventually lead him to negotiate with Mr Clinton.
The budget battle may have reduced Mr Clinton's clout at the negotiating
table. The budget itself has not won him resounding support  - a poll
conducted for the Washington Post and ABC television showed 48 per cent of
respondents disapproved of the economic plan, and only 43 per cent approved
 -and the delay it caused has sapped momentum from healthcare reform.
This will make it difficult to craft a plan that satisfies competing groups
in Congress, let alone the different medical, insurance and consumer
lobbies. Nevertheless, the overall pressure for reform remains strong.

FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Thames Water taps into BOT - A Dollars
700m infrastructure project in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE champagne was on ice. UK Trade Minister Richard Needham had a plane to
catch. And everyone was waiting for the acting head of the Turkish Treasury.
It was a nervous few moments before Mr Osman Unsal scaled the steps of the
British embassy and Thames Water, the privatised UK regional utility, was
able to sign an implementation agreement on a Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m)
Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) water project with the Izmit municipality.
Much has been made of the BOT model of project financing to fund large
public infrastructure but, as Thames Water's experience last month
illustrates, no bank, let alone export credit agency, is likely to support
the scheme without the Treasury's blessing.
The late President Turgut Ozal of Turkey pioneered the concept of BOT, in
which a private developer builds and operates a plant, recovering costs
before handing it over to the public utility. Today, the method is embraced
by Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister, as Turkey searches for ways to meet its
infrastructure needs during rising budget strain.
The key attraction is that BOT falls under the private sector and so does
not bite into the government's balance sheet - important for indebted
countries with limited access to medium- and long-term commercial borrowing.
However, bankers stress that if Turkey finances numerous projects by this
method, the market will reconsider the country's risk profile. Bankers also
point out it would be cheaper if the projects were financed by conventional
turnkey arrangements, where the Treasury offers bank lenders full sovereign
guarantees.
The projects also involve long gestation periods, partly because of their
inherent complexity. Thames Water, with its local partners, Gama and Guris,
has been working on the Izmit water scheme for three years. Chase Manhattan,
the US bank, has been preparing a power plant project at Birecik on the
Euphrates for the best part of six years.
Not one BOT has been successfully concluded. Many contractors have walked
away from earlier attempts at BOT, and even Thames Water is far from safe.
The only beneficiaries so far, perhaps, are the lawyers - legal fees alone
are about 0.5 per cent, according to one estimate.
But, while Turkey's economy is so troubled, bankers see few alternatives.
Investment in the electricity sector, for example, has come to a virtual
standstill, with the World Bank insisting on reform at TEK, the public
utility, before new funds are available. For foreign contractors, BOT is
probably the only way they can win business on large capital equipment
supplies.
Bankers also point out that BOT typically will incorporate an equity element
 -a form of direct capital investment by the consortium which would not be
available on conventional turnkey projects.
Banks like to lend hard currency to projects that earn hard currency. The
BOT is a way around this for projects which depend on local revenue
receipts. There are assumed to be greater efficiencies in using a private
developer rather than the government agent or utility, as the operational
risks of project over-run are carried by the private sector.
The issue of who takes the financial risk is central to the concept of BOT.
Under the scheme the banks lend to a private sector developer and
theoretically the banks' only recourse to the government occurs when the
project goes wrong. Some bankers argue, though, that on such large
infrastructure, government is always involved indirectly.
In the implementation agreement signed last month, Thames Water and the
Izmit water authority agreed terms of the water sale, the volumes, price and
form of payment, which bankers say will be denominated in the underlying
currency of the lending.
Chase Manhattan, financial adviser to the project, is looking for a mix of
Japanese government aid, European export credits and UK and Japanese
commercial bank funding.
Thames Water is also seeking the Treasury's guarantee of the Izmit water
authority's payment obligations. In turn the Treasury must provide some
mechanism to ensure lenders are repaid if the project is abandoned and the
revenue flows interrupted as a result of force majeure. Thames Water is
arranging a subordinated loan mechanism: a standby facility of which the
project company can make use in the case of force majeure.
But ultimately Thames Water's ability to raise finance will be affected by
the Treasury's own appetite for funds.

FT  11 AUG 93 / American Airlines cleared of low-fare aggression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEDERAL jury in Galveston, Texas, yesterday cleared American Airlines, one
the biggest carriers in the US, of allegations that it had deliberately
priced fares below cost last year in an attempt to drive some of its
financially weaker competitors out of business.
The anti-trust case was brought against American by Continental Airlines and
Northwest Airlines, two other sizeable, but smaller, US carriers. It turned
on American's 'value pricing plan', which was unveiled in the spring of 1992
and was a short-lived attempt to simply the different domestic fares schemes
into four basic fare classes. These fares were generally below previous
levels in the same classes.
Continental and Northwest, which claimed to have lost a total of Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 660m) when forced to match the new lower fares, argued that American
was engaged in deliberate predatory pricing. Some colourful evidence,
designed to demonstate American's ruthless management approach, was produced
 -including an internal memo in which Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman,
had scrawled in the margin 'Crush these guys', meaning Pan Am.
American emphatically denied the charges, maintaining that the value pricing
plan was a strategy to help the airline and the industry.
Yesterday, the jury took less than four hours to find that American had not
tried to monopolise air service with its 'value pricing plan'. Afterwards,
Mr Crandall said he was 'enormously pleased', but 'outraged by the time and
cost' of the case. American, he said, had spent upwards of Dollars 20m.
'The brevity of the jury's deliberations underscores how baseless the
allegations were,' commented Mr Crandall.
Continental said it might appeal the verdict, but declined to announce a
firm decision.
On Wall Street, shares in AMR, parent company of American Airlines, rose
yesterday by Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 .

FT  11 AUG 93 / Cuba raises prices in dollar shops
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cuban government has increased by half the prices charged for goods sold
in special shops, in its attempts to obtain more foreign currency and shore
up the economy.
The shops - where goods are sold for dollars - have been especially favoured
by Cubans and foreigners in the past fortnight, since the government's
announcement of its intention to liberalise the foreign currency
regulations, removing the ban on Cubans owning and spending hard currency.
A range of consumer goods, including food and electronic appliances, is sold
in the dollar shops, but is not available in other shops which deal in Cuban
pesos. Cubans who receive funds from relatives abroad have benefited most
from the changes.
Diplomats in Havana, who used to be the main customers at the dollar shops,
said yesterday they expected the price increases to cause a temporary
decline in business, but that Cubans with foreign currency would continue to
buy there.
Cuba's foreign earnings have been hit by a sharp decline in the production
of sugar, the main export, because of bad weather and a shortage of fuel,
machinery and spare parts.
Making it legal for Cubans to own foreign currency and spend it in the
special stores, is unlikely to close the anticipated Dollars 500m (Pounds
335.5m) shortfall in sugar earnings.

AT LEAST five bombs exploded overnight in the Chilean capital and the

said yesterday, AP reports from Santiago.
No one claimed responsibility for the blasts and there was no indication if
the attacks came from Chile's left or right.
The blasts in Santiago were at an office of the Christian Democratic party -
the leading party in the ruling centre-left coalition government - at the
Supreme Court, a bank and at a Chilean government office.
The bomb at Concepcion, south of the capital, shattered windows at offices
of the state-sector coal mining company.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Argentine threat to UK over S Atlantic fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has threatened to retaliate against the UK's introduction of a new
fishing licence regime in the waters around the British-held South Georgia
and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina claims as its own.
Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said: 'Britain will pay a very high
price for this joke.' He said Argentina would censure the British decision
in multilateral conservation bodies covering the Antarctic.
However, the ministry did not expand on what price Argentina planned to
exact from the UK or how it would do so.
Britain had told Argentina privately that it intended to introduce a fishing
regime in the two islands' territorial waters on August 1, but made no
statement on the issue.
Mr Di Tella only announced the British decision on Monday.
London had already extended to 200 miles, from 12 miles, the islands'
territorial waters prior to imposing the licence regime, similar to one
introduced in the nearby Falkland Islands seven years ago.
UK officials said they have already received considerable signs of interest
from fishing companies to take out the new licences, with fees to be based
on a percentage of the catch.
Debate in Argentina over the future of the Falkland Islands has intensified
in the past 10 days, after it had emerged that the Argentine government was
considering the concession, under its sovereignty, of a special status for
the islands, similar to Puerto Rico's status as an associate of the US.
This would enable the islands to retain all their present rights of
self-determination, the use of sterling as currency, and allegiance to the
British crown, while transferring only formal sovereignty to Argentina.
However, some Argentine analysts feared that changing the nature of
Argentina's claim to the islands was only a prelude to surrendering it
altogether.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUPHORIA over China's recent economic growth contrasted sharply with concern
at the challenges faced by other developing countries in the Asia-Pacific
region at the Indonesia, Asia-Pacific and New World Order conference in Bali
yesterday.
China has 'basically solved the problem of feeding and clothing more than
1.1bn people,' said Mr Li Luye, director general of the Centre for
International Studies in China. 'People are convinced. . . China's goals of
reform and opening up are attainable.'
Chinese delegates called for a move toward greater East Asian economic
co-operation. But other delegates noted a reluctance among many Asian
nations to establish far-reaching trade agreements and saw China as a
potentially destabilising force in the region.
They pointed to slow implementation of the free trade area within the
Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), which encompasses
Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. The
benefits of Asean in terms of increased trade and flows of foreign
investment had been minimal, delegates said.
Mr Ajit Singh, Asean secretary general, said China had been drawing foreign
investment away from South-East Asia.

RICOH, the Japanese office equipment company, has formed a Dollars 15m joint
venture to produce facsimile machines in Shanghai, joining the rush of
Japanese companies seeking, in lower-cost China, refuge from yen
appreciation.
The venture, designed to produce machines for sale in China and for export
in the Asian region, is expected to have an output of 40,000 units per month
when a planned factory is completed in 1996.
Ricoh has a 49.5 per cent stake, while Shanghai Facsimile Machines has 45
per cent, and a Hong Kong company, Champion Technology, 5.5 per cent. The
venture will have 800 employees, with a Chinese chairman and a Japanese
president.
The recent appreciation of the yen has encouraged Japanese companies to
locate an increasing share of their production facilities outside Japan so
as to take advantage of lower labour charges and to avoid yen-related costs.
China is a popular site because it offers lower costs and an rapidly growing
domestic market. Facsimile machines sales are expected to rise by 40 to 50
per cent annually until the end of the decade.
Mr Haruo Kamimoto, Ricoh's managing director, said the project is part of a
Beijing-approved programme to overhaul telecommunications infrastructure,
which should ensure that the venture has support.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Brazilians again put off sale of indebted Cosipa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BRAZILIAN government has postponed privatisation of the loss-making
Cosipa steel mill for the third time, after failure to reach agreement over
the company's big debts to Sao Paulo state.
The sale of Cosipa, due today, cannot go ahead until the national commission
overseeing the reduction of the government's role succeeds in renegotiating
the company's equivalent of Dollars 301m in unpaid sales taxes owed to Sao
Paulo.
The commission has proposed that Cosipa repay the debt over eight years
through increasing instalments.
However, Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho of Sao Paulo, says he will only
accept the commission's proposal if his state's terms for renegotiation of
its own debts with the federal government are accepted.
According to the finance ministry, Sao Paulo has debts of more than Dollars
10bn - a figure Mr Fleury hotly contests.
Mr Andre Montoro, commission president, said yesterday: 'The sale of Cosipa
is in the hands of the governor.'
Mr Montoro admitted that Cosipa's minimum sale price, fixed at Dollars 229m,
may have to be reduced if its debts to Sao Paulo are not restructured. Aside
from those, Cosipa owes Dollars 91m to Banco do Brasil and a further Dollars
1bn to other assorted creditors. The Dollars 1bn debt was recently
refinanced.
The latest delay is raising fresh doubts over the commitment of President
Itamar Franco to privatisation. There have been nine cancellations of sales
so far this year and the programme is moving very slowly.
However, Brazilian finance ministry officials say that they are anxious to
get Cosipa off their hands as its debts are costing the government more than
Dollars 1m a day in interest payments.
New privatisation rules are expected to be announced by the Brazilian
government next month. These may include share placements on international
markets.

<TEXT>
MEXICO is slightly changing its tune on the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Once hailed as the crowning achievement of President Carlos Salinas,
officials are at pains to stress it is now just one element of the
government's economic plan and certainly not indispensable to future
stability and growth.
The shift in emphasis has come as negotiations on side agreements have
dragged out longer than expected and Congressional opposition has grown.
Mexican officials, including the president, who used to insist there would
be a pact by January 1 next year, now prefer to say there will be a treaty
'eventually'.
The irony is that Canada, long considered Mexico's ally in Nafta
negotiations, seems the stumbling block.
According to reports in Mexico, an agreement would already have been reached
had Canada not objected to imposition of a combination of fines and
sanctions on countries that do not enforce their environmental and labour
laws.
If Canada does not budge, Mexico faces the dilemma of whether it should
enter into its own side agreements with the US, excluding Canada, to break
the impasse.

<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of foreign investment projects in eastern and central Europe has
continued to grow rapidly this year, though many involve a relatively small
injection of overseas capital, according to the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe.
New foreign investment registrations in the former Comecon countries of
Europe totalled more than 7,000 in the first quarter of 1993, bringing the
overall number to 72,300. This compares with just over 31,000 registrations
at the beginning of 1992.
The ECE's latest round-up* shows growth was most rapid in Romania, where
23,500 foreign investment projects were registered at the end of March 1993.
Romania now has the largest number of enterprises with overseas
participation in the region. However, most have a very small foreign capital
component and 'appear to have been encouraged by the provision of special
tax concessions by the government'.
Registrations of joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries in Hungary totalled
over 14,000 at the end of March. In Poland, about 10,000 foreign investment
projects were registered by then.
The ECE also notes a surge of interest by foreign companies in the Baltic
states, with the number of foreign investment projects rising to 4,000 in
Estonia, 2,800 in Latvia and 2,300 in Lithuania. Here too, however, the
amount of overseas capital involved is small. In members of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, foreign investment registrations rose from 7,000 to
8,000 in the first quarter this year, compared with 2,600 at the beginning
of 1992.

FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Nafta's future in balance over side deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the North American Free Trade Agreement is in the balance,
pending decisions by the US, Canada and Mexico on a handful of politically
sensitive side deals on labour and the environment.
The uncertainty was summed up by a Canadian official yesterday who said the
three countries were 'very, very close' to an agreement, but that 'there are
a couple of really tough issues which people have to think through'.
After almost two weeks of talks in Washington, which ended on Monday
afternoon, negotiators are now reporting back to their governments on the
remaining obstacles. The three countries' trade ministers met for more than
five hours on Monday.
Senior negotiators may meet again tomorrow, depending on the prospects for
breaking the deadlock. One official said it had become impossible to look
more than '24 or 36 hours ahead'.
The most intractable issues remain enforcement of the two side agreements
and the sanctions which would be applied for non-compliance.
Canada, in particular, is resisting US efforts to penalise violations of
environmental and labour standards with compulsory trade remedies.
'We see protectionism written all over that,' one Canadian official said.
The Mexicans, who have more at stake in Nafta as a whole, are understood to
be taking a more flexible line on the sanctions issue.
A number of alternatives have been proposed, including fines levied against
violators, and a 'menu' of sanctions from which the parties could choose in
the event of a dispute.
Another possibility is that the US will conclude separate enforcement
agreements with Canada and Mexico.
On the labour front, the three countries have yet to agree on the scope of
domestic labour legislation.
A strong political element is clouding the closing stages of the Nafta
talks.
The Clinton administration cannot afford to sign a deal which does not have
a reasonable chance of being ratified by the two houses of Congress.
In Canada, the Progressive Conservative government faces a general election
within the next three months. Free trade is not popular among Canadian
voters, and Prime Minister Kim Campbell is unlikely to approve any deal
which can be interpreted as 'caving in' to the Americans.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS forces in Somalia yesterday closed two airfields to stop
supplies to fighters loyal to the fugitive warlord, General Mohammed Farah
Aideed, agencies report from Mogadishu.
Pakistani UN troops barricaded runways at an airfield 50km west of Mogadishu
and at second airstrip nearby. UN aircraft dropped thousands of leaflets
saying the airfields would be closed indefinitely.
A UN military spokesman, Major Dave Stockwell, said Gen Aideed's supporters
used the airfields to smuggle arms and shipments of khat, a narcotic plant
chewed by many Somalis. 'We know the Aideed faction obtains a good
proportion of its financing through importing and selling khat,' Maj
Stockwell said.
The UN action came two days after Somali gunmen killed four American UN
peacekeepers in an ambush. The closure appeared to be a first step towards a
new crackdown on Gen Aideed, blamed by the UN for Sunday's ambush.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Palestinians widen peace wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TUNIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIVIDED Palestinian leaders last night were thrashing out fundamental
differences over how to handle peace negotiations with Israel for a third
straight night. The talks were widened yesterday to include more officials,
who flew into Tunis for the 'serious and decisive' discussions.
The Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation said the talks now
involved a majority of the negotiating delegation with Israel and most of
the PLO's executive committee. It said the talks were aiming at healing a
severe rupture in Palestinian ranks and hammering out an agreed negotiating
strategy.
PLO officials and a member of the negotiating team confirmed that three top
peace negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories had offered to
resign at a meeting in Tunis on Sunday night.
Palestinian officials said the resignation threat by Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr
Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat, had disturbed PLO leader Yassir Arafat
and shaken Palestinian leaders inside and outside the territories.
Most Palestinians believe the three negotiators are using the resignation
threat in a power play to force Mr Arafat to strengthen their role in the
negotiating process.
The delegates feel they must be consulted more in the future rather than
being treated as go-betweens delivering messages from Mr Arafat to the
Israelis and the US.
But last night's talks also focussed on divisions over whether progress with
Israel can be made without direct PLO involvement and without immediate
commencement of talks on a final, rather than an interim, settlement in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Also due for discussion were calls by Palestinians in the occupied
territories for fundamental reforms of the bureaucratic and authoritarian
PLO.
Palestinian officials said the three negotiators felt upset about the way Mr
Arafat had undermined their position last week by presenting a slightly more
moderate position paper to the US through the Egyptian president without
adequate prior consultation.
In the PLO document, which lays the framework for an interim five-year
period of Palestinian self-rule, Mr Arafat appears to take a more flexible
position on how to deal with the sensitive issue of Arab versus Jewish
claims over control of Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem during the
interim phase.
Some Palestinians suspect Mr Arafat's more moderate position was made to
curry favour with Egypt and the US, which backs a postponement of discussing
who should control East Jerusalem until talks on a final settlement, due to
begin three years into the interim phase.
They say the moderate position taken by the PLO also reflects the way the
PLO leadership in exile has lost touch with the situation in the territories
and is increasingly eager to strike a deal.
Palestinian negotiators from the territories believe their agreement to such
a concession to Israel would be political suicide, given the growing
strength of extremists and Islamic fundamentalists inside the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The three Palestinian negotiators are also frustrated at what Mr Husseini
has called being a 'mailman' for Mr Arafat rather than a full partner in the
negotiating strategy.
Many Palestinians wonder whether Mr Arafat, who is concerned about a
possible alternative Palestinian leadership during an interim phase, is
committed to the process or is trying to ensure continuing deadlock as a way
of forcing the US and Israel to open a direct dialogue with the PLO.
Palestinians from the territories support the inclusion of the PLO in the
process but believe that democratic reforms in the liberation movement must
be implemented quickly.
Another issue due to be discussed last night was the so-called 'Gaza First'
option - a proposal to hand over full power to Palestinians in the Gaza
Strip quickly and before a final settlement in the West Bank.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Road to China is mapped across Laos: The opportunities and
worries arising from better transport links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently, the single biggest foreign exchange earner for the Laotian
government was the sale to airline companies of permission to fly over the
country. Now a bridge is being built across the Mekong River from Thailand
that will eventually allow people to drive through Laos all the way to
China.
Government officials in Vientiane, the Laotian capital, are anxious to
prevent the country from becoming a bypass on the route between south-east
Asia and China, or what one foreign resident referred to as an 'Indochina
truck stop'. But western and Asian diplomats in the city say Laos could
benefit greatly from improved transport links with its neighbours.
Today, the country's largest income derives from the sale of hydroelectric
power to Thailand and trade with Thailand is an essential and growing sector
of the economy.
The government expects this trade to continue to expand, particularly after
the Mekong River bridge linking the two countries is completed. The bridge,
which is being financed by a USDollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) grant from the
Australian government, is scheduled to open in April next year.
The Thailand-Laos Friendship Bridge is the first stage in a grand scheme to
link Thailand by road with China, Burma and Vietnam. The idea is to upgrade
existing north-south and east-west routes through Laos to ease the flow of
goods between south-east Asia, Vietnam, Burma and China.
Laotian officials are cautious about the scheme, which they say could
seriously damage the domestic economy if it allows Chinese goods to flood
the country. Industrial development has been slow in Laos and domestic
producers are in no position to compete with cheap Chinese imports.
It will be some time before the Thailand-China highway will be a reality,
but work has already started on a road to carry Laotian goods to the
Vietnamese coast for export.
Thailand's ambassador to Vientiane, Mr Nikhom Tantemsapya, said Laos should
benefit greatly from better transport. 'If Laos can turn itself into an
effective middleman, it could really reap some profit,' he said.
He said the people of Laos should be wary of too much foreign influence, not
only from Thailand but also from the other four countries which border this
land-locked nation: Burma, China, Vietnam and Cambodia. 'Laos is a small
country and has every right to fear people might come in and exploit their
resources; but it should not be limited only to Thailand,' he said.
Meanwhile, Thai traders are becoming increasingly active in the Laotian
capital, taking advantage of the economic reforms instituted in the late
1980s when Laos abandoned a commitment to a centrally planned socialist
economy.
For now, it is largely a one-way trade and Laos's annual exports are still
worth less than half its imports.
Thailand is also the biggest foreign investor in the country, with
investments worth Dollars 160m - at least 40 per cent of the total. All
eight of the new banks being built in Vientiane are Thai-owned and there is
a general sense on the streets of the capital that Thai influence is
pervasive.
In Vientiane and the other towns along the Laotian side of the Mekong River,
most radios and TVs are tuned to the Thai channels broadcast from the other
bank. Cafes and shops play Thai pop music and there is a growing number of
signs written in Thai.
Western diplomats say the Laotian government is well aware of the need to
control the flood of Thai economic and cultural influences. They also say
the government's economic reforms have been a great success so far and that
the domestic economy is developing along sound lines.
Gross domestic product grew by 7 per cent in 1992 and is expected to expand
at about the same rate until the mid-1990s. The agricultural sector
contributes almost 60 per cent of GDP but industry and the service sector
are also growing steadily.
In June the International Monetary Fund backed the government's economic
reform programme with a Dollars 50m loan under its enhanced structural
adjustment facility.
Outside the capital, though, little is changing for the 85 per cent of
Laotians who still live by subsistence farming.
Officially, Laos is one of the five poorest countries in the world with a
per capita GDP of just over Dollars 200 a year.
However, western diplomats say these statistics disguise a growing rural
economy where trade is mostly done by barter and does not show up in
official figures.
Nobody suggests Laos is a wealthy country but the diplomats say few people
are living in poverty since the government's economic reforms allowed them
greater access to a market economy.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Nigeria urged to name civilian interim leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government may be preparing to name a civilian as interim
head of state next week amid growing demands for an end to army rule.
Vice-President Augustus Aikhomu, speaking on state radio, said the committee
considering the powers and composition of the interim government had
recommended that the appointee should also be chairman of an interim
national government and should be named next week. But it remains unclear
whether effective power will be transferred to the civilian leader due to be
installed by August 27, the date President Ibrahim Babangida was supposed to
surrender office to an elected president.
Yesterday in Lagos armed soldiers were deployed at strategic bridges amid
fears that a planned protest against the military government would prompt a
renewal of riots that have killed dozens of people.
The Campaign for Democracy, the coalition that called last month's protest
against Gen Babangida's decision to annul the June 12 presidential election,
has called on people to stay away from work and take to the streets from
tomorrow until Saturday.
Backing came yesterday from a group of retired generals and prominent
civilians, led by the ex-military leader, retired Gen Olusegun Obasanjo. 'We
urge all Nigerians to embark upon peaceful and non-violent means of
expressing their disapproval. . . if Nigeria is to be saved from violent
upheavals with disastrous socio-economic and political consequences,' said
the Association for Democracy and Good Governance.
Unofficial returns in the June poll gave a comfortable victory to Mr Moshood
Abiola, now in Washington lobbying for support for his claim to the
presidency. Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, voted heavily in favour of
Mr Abiola and any stay-away is likely to paralyse the city.
Businessmen yesterday started closing down offices, banks and supermarkets.
However, Mr Aikhomu said the military government would declare a state of
emergency if there was a breakdown of law and order.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Seoul to toughen stance on Pyongyang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA yesterday indicated that it would adopt a tougher attitude on
the North Korean nuclear issue after Pyongyang rejected a proposal by Seoul
to resume talks on mutual nuclear inspections.
'We gave everything we could give at the last round of North Korea-US
high-level talks. Now it's time to show Pyongyang what sticks are in store,'
said Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister.
During its discussions with the US last month, North Korea was offered
improved relations with Washington and the supply of safer light-water
reactors to replace its graphite-moderated ones if it accepted full nuclear
inspections by South Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA). The IAEA wants to examine sites to determine if North Korea is
reprocessing more plutonium than it has disclosed, for possible use in
developing nuclear weapons.
North Korea said on Monday that it rejected holding talks with the South
through the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission and instead insisted
that the dispute about Pyongyang's nuclear programme be linked to a summit
meeting between the presidents of the two Koreas.
Seoul refuses the Pyongyang demand for a summit, calling it 'premature'
until the nuclear dispute is resolved.
Both the US and South Korea have suggested that they may ask the UN Security
Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea by the end of September
unless Pyongyang shows results in talks with the IAEA and South Korea on the
nuclear issue.
IAEA inspectors yesterday completed maintenance work on monitoring equipment
installed at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex.
But the IAEA is still barred from two nuclear waste sites. The IAEA demand
to view these sites triggered North Korea's announcement last March that it
was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, although it later
suspended the threatened action after holding talks with the US.

A South African court yesterday granted bail of R30,000 (Pounds 6,000) to
Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis, one of three whites accused of assassinating Mr Chris
Hani, the black Communist party leader, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Mrs Derby-Lewis, 54, her husband Clive, a former right-wing member of
parliament, and a Polish immigrant, Mr Janusz Walus, are due to stand trial
in October for Mr Hani's murder, which triggered violence by blacks last
April. The ANC denounced the granting of bail to Mrs Derby-Lewis, saying it
underscored suspicions of government racism. The application was also
opposed by prosecutor Mr Gerard Nel, who said he feared she could be in
danger out of prison. But Rand Supreme Court Judge C Plewman said he had
agreed with her lawyers where she would live.

THE second draft of an outline multiracial constitution for South Africa was
unveiled yesterday, providing for the first time a fairly detailed view of
the powers of regions within a future federal state.
The document, which follows widespread criticism of the first draft unveiled
two weeks ago, goes some way towards allaying fears that a future central
government could have its own way.
The government/National Party, Democratic Party and Concerned South Africans
Group (Cosag) all complained that the original draft offered insufficient
powers to the regions. This deficiency was one of the main reasons causing
the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party and the right-wing Conservative Party
to withdraw from the talks last month.
Although the latest draft represents a considerable change on its
forerunner, spelling out the nature and extent of powers regions will
exercise, it is unlikely to draw Inkatha back to negotiations. Concern about
how a future constituent assembly will behave if there is disagreement over
the final form of a constitution has still to be addressed.
The technical committee drafting the constitution yesterday sought further
guidance from negotiators on this point. Inkatha's central committee will be
reviewing its participation in negotiations when it meets on Saturday.
The latest draft says regional governments will have 'exclusive legislative
competences', in 15 different functional areas ranging from planning powers
and service delivery to tourism and casinos. These powers may not be altered
by the national government except in accord with special circumstances
identified in the constitution, and only to the extent that the constitution
allows intervention.
In the main areas of government such as education, health, agriculture and
housing, regional governments will enjoy 'concurrent legislative competence'
with the national government. This means, in the words of the drafters, that
the national government cannot use its powers to negate those of the region.
In the event of a dispute over powers, this will be settled by a court.

Taipei police lead away a Chinese street vendor who earlier had hijacked an
Air China Boeing 767 aircraft to Taiwan. China, which demanded that Taiwan
swiftly return the man, has blamed three hijackings in four months on
Taiwan's policy of detaining rather than repatriating air pirates.

MACHINERY orders by the Japanese private sector showed a modest increase in
June compared with May, the second seasonally adjusted improvement in a row.
But against the same month of 1992 orders suffered their 15th successive
fall.
Releasing the figures yesterday, which are taken as a guide to
manufacturers' capital spending plans, the Economic Planning Agency said
earlier signs that orders had bottomed out had now receded.
Machinery orders - excluding those placed for ships and electricity
generation, where demand is volatile - showed a 0.8 per cent month-on-month
increase in June after a 3.7 per cent rise in May. However, they remained
13.3 per cent below their level of a year earlier.
A particularly poor April left orders for the second quarter as a whole down
16.7 per cent compared with the preceding three months and 16.0 per cent
adrift of the same period in 1992. The EPA's third-quarter forecast is for a
10.2 per cent rise from the April-June level - continuing a pattern of
alternating quarterly gains and losses which set in at the beginning of last
year. Against the three months to last Sept-ember, though, it expects a 14.8
per cent fall.
Food, agriculture and transport were the only sectors to show increased
demand in the latest three months. A second successive quarterly rise in
demand from abroad, which makes up around a quarter of all public and
private orders, is expected to be reversed next time following the latest
appreciation in the yen. The EPA also said it expected a decline in orders
from the domestic public sector in the current period.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, told a press conference
yesterday he would seek to ensure the implementation of a Y13,200bn (Pounds
84bn) package of public works spending and tax concessions to stimulate the
becalmed economy, agreed in April by the previous Liberal Democratic party
government.
Outlining the maintenance of a conservative fiscal policy, he said his
seven-party coalition would aim for sustainable economic growth driven by
domestic demand.
According to figures yesterday from the Bank of Japan, outstanding loans by
the country's commercial banks grew 1 per cent last month, the slowest on
record.
Central bank officials said this reflected the wariness of companies to
invest in plant and equipment, as well as a shift to other forms of
financing such as commercial paper issues. Lending growth was likely to
remain low, they added.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, meanwhile, that
industrial use of electricity in June, a more immediate measure of economic
activity, was 1.3 per cent higher than a year earlier.

ANGOLA'S resurgent civil war has intensified, with a new rebel push against
the besieged city of Cuito and government attempts to pound into submission
Unita guerrillas in their Huambo stronghold, Reuter reports from Luanda.
The government says 14,000 people have been killed in the seven-month rebel
onslaught against Cuito.
If confirmed, the death toll would make the battle for the city the most
deadly of the civil war. Unita said yesterday it had seized part of Cuito,
where the government says rebel shelling has killed more than 200 civilians
in the past few days.
Rebel radio, monitored in the island state of Sao Tome and Principe, said
Unita forces had smashed a battalion of government soldiers as they forced
their way into the city on the eastern fringe of the central highlands.
The radio claimed government air raids on the nearby rebel capital, Huambo,
had killed more than 200 civilians over the past week.
Unita took control of Huambo, Angola's second city with a population of
500,000, in March after a siege in which an estimated 12,000 people were
killed.
Diplomats in Luanda say about 2,500 government soldiers and paramilitary
police are defending Cuito against a much larger force of well armed Unita
troops.
The rebels and the ruling MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola) government signed a peace agreement in 1991 to end the civil war,
which had been fought since 1975.
But Unita returned to the bush after rejecting its defeat by the MPLA in
supervised elections last September.

<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday indicated that
he is ready to resign if his seven-party coalition government fails to
implement promised political reforms by the end of the year.
In his first press conference as prime minister, Mr Hosokawa was blunt in
answering questions, providing a stark contrast to the often rambling and
unintelligible replies proffered by leaders of previous Liberal Democratic
party governments. The LDP has just lost office after governing for 38
years.
However, the substance of the prime minister's answers was not very
different. Mr Hosokawa promised to take 'full responsibility' if plans to
overhaul the electoral system are not realised this year - an answer which,
in Japan, means he is willing to resign.
The coalition's priority is to replace a corruption-prone multi-seat
constituency system with a combination of single seats and proportional
representation. The parties have also promised to introduce a ban on
corporate political donations.
Explaining that there should be some continuity, Mr Hosokawa was irritated
by suggestions that his coalition's cabinet, dominated by ex-LDP
politicians, is the LDP in disguise: 'There is a clear difference in the way
we will do things. We are not the same.'
One difference was in the conduct of the press conference. Mr Hosokawa
preferred to stand rather than sit in the velvet chair preferred by his
predecessor, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, and he appeared without his parliamentary
badge on his lapel.
Lapel badges are worn by Japanese workers to indicate corporate loyalty, but
Mr Hosokawa has suggested that he dislikes the creation of status
distinction through badges. When asked yesterday why his lapel was bare, he
said it was not his habit to wear the badge outside parliament.
Mr Hosokawa stated clearly that Japan was the aggressor in the second world
war, and said the country was still hoping for a settlement with Russia over
the disputed Kurile Islands, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the
war. Japan, he said, would continue to provide 'appropriate' aid to Moscow.
On trade relations with the US, he said the setting of numerical targets for
market share, as Washington has requested, is a violation of market
principles, but he conceded that the large trade surplus concerns the new
government, which will attempt to improve market access.
He said the government was considering a review of budgetary procedure,
which he considers 'rigid', and wants to increase spending that 'will
improve the quality of people's life'. It was unclear whether he was talking
about the budget for the year beginning in April.
In handling issues of policy conflict between the conservative coalition
members and the left-leaning Social Democratic party, Mr Hosokawa was brief
but unclear. For example, he said a rice market opening, opposed by the SDP,
was banned by a parliamentary resolution, but did not say if he planned to
amend that resolution.

FT  11 AUG 93 / French call to keep monetary union timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community should respect the timetable for achieving monetary
union, Mr Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European affairs, said
yesterday. He played down remarks by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that the target
dates for creating a European currency might need extending.
'Let us keep to the calendar that we have together settled and on which we
are all agreed,' Mr Lamassoure said in a radio interview.
The German chancellor had warned on Monday that strict insistence on
economic convergence between EC member states could delay creation of a
single European currency 'by a year or two.' Under the Maastricht treaty on
European union, EC members are to introduce a single currency in 1997 or at
the latest by 1999.
But some French officials indicated a flexible stance on the timing of
monetary union. They said Mr Lamassoure's comments were mainly concerned
with the second stage of monetary union, which involves establishment of a
European Monetary Institute, precursor to a European central bank, and does
not involve strict convergence targets on inflation and budget deficits.
This stage is due to take effect from January 1 next year.
As to the third and more demanding phase of monetary union, French officials
said that, if EC member countries had difficulty in achieving the economic
convergence criteria, it might be better to extend the timetable than to
relax the required criteria.
One French official said that the question of the timetable for monetary
union would be discussed by the EC heads of government at their special
summit planned for October.
Mr Lamassoure denied any discord between Bonn and Paris and expressed
optimism about continued progress towards European integration.
Belgian Finance Minister Philipe Maystadt said that creating a single EC
currency by 1999 remained realistic, Reuter reports from Brussels.
He said Chancellor Kohl's remarks merely indicated 'in a realistic manner
that the timetable for a single currency is more likely to be January 1,
1999, than January 1, 1997,' he said.

A coal strike which has brought work to a standstill in the Jiu valley,
Romania's main deep mining region, looked to be winding down last night
after the government said union leaders had softened their pay demands,
writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
A government official said the union was demanding wages ranging from 87,000
lei (Pounds 72) a month up to 281,000 lei (Pounds 233), including
supplements for night shift, overtime and dangerous work, compared to the
original demand for up to 320,000 lei (Pounds 266).
Discussions were continuing to see if the miners' proposals could be
reconciled with an offer of an average wage of 166,000 lei including
supplements from the RAH, the state-owned company which administers the
region's 13 mines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S leading union, representing some 550,000 workers in public sector
industries such as coal and steel, is to strike from August 25 in a direct
challenge to the pay restraint policies of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the new prime
minister, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. Turk-Is, the country's
largest workers' federation, is demanding average pay increases of 85 per
cent. This compares with inflation at an annual rate of 73 per cent in July
and an earlier pay demand of 95 per cent.
Public sector pay restraint is central to Mrs Ciller's efforts to bring down
the public sector borrowing requirement, which is projected at around 15 per
cent of gross national product in 1993, and is the main cause of Turkey's
persistently high inflation. Mrs Ciller warned earlier that the budget
deficit could reach TL150,000bn (Pounds 8.7bn), three times the target for
the year.
Any failure to curb wage demands will increase operating losses of the state
sector industries and thus fuel the PSBR. However, the prime minister must
be wary of alienating union support at a time of considerable retrenchment
in the state industries and ahead of her plans for a large-scale
privatisation programme.

FT  11 AUG 93 / 'Mother of all bribes' produces first brood:
Ferruzzi-Enimont affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'mother of all bribes' - the L135bn (Pounds 56m) allegedly paid by
Italy's Ferruzzi group to politicians during the brief life of the
public-private Enimont chemicals joint venture - is spawning its first
offspring.
Last week, Ferruzzi's new management revealed that it had taken legal action
to freeze L500bn in assets of six former managers or members of the Ferruzzi
family. The new management, imposed by bank creditors earlier this year on
the highly-indebted concern, warned that the net might be widened to include
others allegedly involved.
The temporary sequestration, to be examined by a Milan court on August 16,
is the first shot in what may be a barrage of legal actions for compensation
and damages regarding Enimont, which was dissolved in 1990 with debts of
L8,341bn.
Ferruzzi's new bosses have presented evidence to a Milan court indicating
serious financial mismanagement, including allegations that huge losses were
covered up. Enimont-related kickbacks are believed to lie at the heart of
the action, although the case is also thought to embrace alleged attempts by
former executives to cover up US commodity trading losses suffered by
Ferruzzi in 1989.
Enimont's origins date back to the late 1980s, when politicians and
businesmen were looking to boost the chemicals industry.
Although at the time Italy was one of the western world's six biggest
economies and internationally competitive in cars, computers, and white
goods, chemicals had always been its Achilles heel.
The post-war chemicals industry was fragmented and poorly managed. In other
European countries, the industry had already been rationalised to create a
handful of large, broadly based multinationals with the resources and
marketing clout to prosper in such a capital-intensive business.
By contrast, Italy was handicapped by a multiplicity of medium-sized
manufacturers making too many products in too many places. The plants they
built, frequently with the help of state subsidies for the economically
depressed south, were often ill-conceived, poorly located and uncompetitive.
Enimont was supposed to end all that. By combining the bulk chemicals assets
of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group with Ferruzzi's Montedison
chemicals arm, Italy would create the world's tenth biggest chemicals group.
With direct access to raw materials through Eni, and the economies of scale
needed to make a profit in bulk petrochemicals, the new company was supposed
to have all the ingredients for success.
The reality was different. Rather than combining the best of the two
partners, Enimont emerged as in many ways an amalgam of the worst of the
two. The company, with its plethora of small, and sometimes overlapping
plants, replicated the fragmentation of the sector as a whole.
Control was divided evenly between Eni and Montedison and the remaining 20
per cent of the shares were floated. This ownership structure, coupled with
the diametrically opposed views of the two partners, paralysed
decision-making.
Leaked testimony from many of those involved in the creation of Enimont
suggests the company's origins were as much linked to boosting the funds of
various political parties as to high industrial expectations. Montedison,
which was promised huge tax breaks to take part, allegedly paid L15bn to the
Christian Democrat and Socialist parties even before Enimont was set up,
according to leaked testimony.
By mid-1990, less than a year after its birth, it was clear Enimont could
not survive in its present form. Mr Raul Gardini, head of Ferruzzi during
the Enimont affair who committed suicide last month, had orchestrated a
behind-the-scenes blitz to buy Enimont shares on the stock market to try to
increase his voting power in the venture; Eni responded with court action to
freeze the shares; decision-making at Enimont was further hampered.
By September, Eni and Montedison invoked the complex procedure to dissolve
the partnership. Soon after, Eni paid L2,805bn for Montedison's 40 per cent
stake.
Magistrates are investigating various aspects of the termination deal,
notably the price, which many observers thought excessive. According to the
leaked testimony, Montedison allegedly paid about L100bn in kickbacks to
many of the political leaders of the time to smooth the transaction and win
approval for an allegedly inflated price. The valuation was more than 25 per
cent higher than the company's value at the price before shares were frozen.
The leaked testimony, mainly from Mr Giuseppe Garofano, formerly
Montedison's managing director, suggests the company's management continued
paying bribes until the April 1992 general elections. Apparently undeterred
by the fact that magistrates were already on the trail of political
corruption - then limited to local politicians in Milan - the company is
alleged to have paid a further L7bn to the parties in the outgoing coalition
government.
Milan magistrates are still piecing together the details of the bribes paid
during the saga. Mr Gardini and Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman at the
time, are out of the picture after committing suicide.
However, the sequestration order obtained by Ferruzzi's new managment
includes three senior executives who worked for Ferruzzi during the Enimont
saga and two Ferruzzi family members who also occupied senior positions, as
well as Mr Gardini's heirs.
The magistrates, who have already interrogated most of those cited in the
Ferruzzi action, are also questioning people from outside the company. Eight
senior politicians have so far been told they are under investigation.
Last week, magistrates arrested Mr Alberto Grotti, a former deputy chairman
of Eni during the Enimont affair. Mr Vincenzo Palladino, the deputy chairman
of Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's most prestigious banks, is
also being questioned, as is Mr Sergio Cusani, a financier associated with
the Socialist party, who allegedly acted as go-between in many of the
bribes.
In spite of their diligence, the magistrates investigating the 'mother of
all bribes' may not yet have reached the roots of the family tree.
Meanwhile, losses at EniChem, the successor company to Enimont, have
continued to rise, reaching L1,560bn last year, The company's financial
performance is set to deteriorate because of recession and continuing
political obstacles to rationalising its fragmented structure.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali can take comfort: he is not the only casualty of
controversy surrounding assistance to eastern Europe.
Accusations of excessive spending and wayward management have also dogged
the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund (HAEF), the Dollars 60m fund set up
by the US government in 1989 to nourish Hungary's embryonic private sector.
This week, after a long pursuit, the critics claimed the scalp of the HAEF's
president, Mr Alexander Tomlinson, former chairman of US investment bank
First Boston.
Mr Tomlinson resigned on Monday citing 'political interference' and a freeze
of allocations by the US Congress which had 'paralysed' the HAEF's
operations.
The resignation comes in the wake of a critical congressional review of the
HAEF. The House Appropriations Committee declared in the June report it was
'outraged' at the activities of the HAEF and had 'lost confidence' in its
leadership.
The target of censure is the HAEF's investment of Dollars 4m in EurAmerica
Capital Corporation and acquiescence in annual salaries of nearly Dollars
400,000 for the young executives heading up the Budapest-based merchant
bank.
Defenders of two funds say that their autonomy is the real issue and that
EurAmerica has merely provided an excuse for Congressional overseers and the
foreign aid bureaucracy to reassert their infringed authority.
As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development argued that marble
hallways were standard for a bank headquarters, the HAEF holds that
EurAmerica counts as a private business and must pay its managers the going
rate for investment bankers.
Mr Tomlinson maintained in his resignation letter that EurAmerica was moving
into operating profit and that fees were covering the controversial
salaries.
But critics contend that compensation has been excessive and violates US
government guidelines. Some also question the investment banking credentials
of Mr Marc Holtzman, EurAmerica's president and managing director.
Mr Holtzman's claim to fame is his earlier incarnation as self-styled
'mascot of the Reagan administration'. At 20, he ran Reagan's 1980
presidential campaign in his native Pennsylvania and ran as a Republican for
the House of Representatives in 1986 as the youngest and best-funded
congressional candidate.
As the Reaganite tide ebbed, Mr Holtzman embarked on a business career in
central-eastern Europe and last year he and two partners established
EurAmerica.
Mr Holtzman's talent for brokering connections, honed in US politics, has
proved valuable in doing business in Hungary, where it is truer than usual
that who you know counts as much as what you know.
But the half-dozen US enterprise funds for eastern Europe are Bush
administration creations and the top executives generally have a Republican
background. This being the case with Mr Holtzman, the damaging if weakly
founded suggestion has been prompted that political connections, rather than
business expertise, helped him win the HAEF's backing.
Whether or not the HAEF's investment in EurAmerica was good business, it is
clear with hindsight that the decision invited political attack. 'EurAmerica
really was a juicy target,' says one US diplomat, who says it provided a
'handle' for congressional attempts to limit the independence of the funds.
The HAEF is no stranger to political accidents. Soon after its foundation it
ran into flak for investing in businesses headed by prominent former
communists. The HAEF's actions also contributed to the downfall last month
of Mr Pal Teleki, the Hungarian-American chairman of Hungary's state holding
company AV RT.
Mr Teleki was weakened by revelations that he was receiving a hidden salary
top-up of Dollars 130,000 from the HAEF. The HAEF and the Hungarian
government justified the payments as the price of attracting Mr Teleki to
head the AV RT when he would have been unable to meet commitments on his
official salary.
But the subsidy fuelled speculation that Mr Teleki might favour US investors
and advisers in the privatisation of the AV RT's huge portfolio of state
utilities, banks and industrial companies. It played to reviving public
suspicion of a foreign takeover of the Hungarian economy.
The HAEF's payments to Mr Teleki may have broken US rules on payments to
officials of a foreign government. But above all, HAEF managers were said to
have lacked 'political sensitivity'. The phrase runs like a thread through
the affairs which have entangled the Hungarian fund.
The supervisors of the two funds and the EBRD are trying to insure against a
repetition of public relations errors. But the authorities have to be
careful lest they inhibit risk-taking in investment decisions. 'There has to
be a tolerance for mistakes,' says a US official. 'The funds ought to be
innovative and ought to be making mistakes.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE shredding at Volkswagen of documents brought to Germany by Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the group's new production director, has left
unanswered questions about the fate of other data missing from Adam Opel,
the German subsidiary of General Motors.
Mr Dino Martinez, the man who compiled the material, destroyed during the
last week in March, dispatched several other shipments at the request of Mr
Lopez, former global procurement chief at GM.
Mr Martinez, described yesterday as Mr Lopez's former 'handyman' at Opel,
has since moved and is working for the US group in Spain.
He was the GM employee referred to anonymously in a VW statement on Monday
as being responsible for collating and posting 'magazines, clippings and
correspondence with suppliers'. The statement did not say he was acting on
Mr Lopez's instructions.
These items, described by VW officials as usual, personal office contents,
were shredded in the group's guest house in Wolfsburg, at Mr Lopez's
suggestion, to prevent any chance of 'possibly sensitive' material being
distributed inside VW, the German group has said.
Mr Martinez sent similar material in early February to Mr Lopez in Detroit.
VW officials said they knew nothing more, and could not comment on the fate
of a further three shipments sent later by Mr Martinez, on Mr Lopez's
instructions, to an address in northern Spain, Mr Lopez's birthplace.
One of these, dispatched on February 22, while Mr Lopez was negotiating a
contract with VW, comprised nine boxes and weighed 150kg.
A further batch of 'internal' Opel papers, again at the request of Mr Lopez,
was sent to the same Spanish address on March 10, the day after he signed
his contract with VW.
Mr Lopez and former GM colleagues, under investigation for suspected
industrial espionage, theft and perjury, are alleged to have systematically
plundered GM secrets in the period before they left for Volkswagen in March.
Mr Lopez last Friday won full support from VW's non-executive supervisory
board, which said a thorough investigation had shown no grounds for
accusations of industrial espionage.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE director of the US Central Intelligence Agency yesterday collected the
body of a US diplomat murdered earlier this week in the republic of Georgia.
The visit to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, by Mr James Woolsey, the new CIA
director, confirmed reports that the murdered man was a CIA agent.
Mr Woolsey flew to Tbilisi after talks in Moscow with Mr Yevgeny Primakov,
his Russian counterpart. Mr Fred Woodruff, described as a US political
counsellor, was shot dead on Sunday night by an unknown gunman as he was
riding in a car driven by the personal security chief of the Georgian
leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze.
Officials quoted by the New York Times said Mr Woodruff was one of several
people known by the Georgian leadership to be working for the CIA.
No motive has been officially advanced for the killing however. It may also
have been a random shooting incident in Georgia's civil strife, or aimed at
Mr Shevardnadze's security chief, or simply to embarrass Mr Shevardnadze,
who is fighting both domestic political rivals and separatist rebels.
The head of Russia's Security Council, one of the country's top
decision-making bodies, has offered to resign, Interfax news agency said
yesterday.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, 51, appointed just two months ago, told the
agency he had asked President Boris Yeltsin to be relieved of his duties but
gave no reasons. It was not immediately clear whether his resignation had
been accepted.

FT  11 AUG 93 / German bid invited for Channel rail link contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has privately invited a leading German contractor to form a
consortium and compete for the contract to build the Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn
high-speed rail link connecting the Channel tunnel with London.
Its approach to Hochtief - the Essen-based contractor responsible for
shifting the temples at Abu Simbel in Egypt and constructing the Bosporus
Bridge - is likely to annoy UK companies that have spent, in some cases,
millions of pounds in preliminary assessments.
The approach suggests the government is not happy with the companies which
have expressed interest in the project so far and is anxious to inject extra
competition into the bidding process. The government appears so eager to
transfer responsibility for the link to the private sector that it is ready
to award the work to continental European contractors with greater financial
muscle than their British counterparts. It is unclear whether soundings have
been made among other overseas groups.
The Department of Transport does not acknowledge the approach to Hochtief.
Officially, the government had made no 'proactive approaches' to individual
companies, the department said. But Hochtief confirmed it had been asked to
form a consortium. 'Of course, we are very interested,' it said.
Under the British Treasury's so-called Ryrie Rules, private sector finance
is allowed only if companies can prove that they can provide better value
for money than the public sector. This is not usually the case as the
government can borrow at lower rates of interest than the private sector.
The government's move will be seen by Eurorail, the Trafalgar House-GEC-BICC
joint venture established specifically to bid for the work on the link, as a
blow to its chances of success.
The chairman of a large construction company allied to the consortium said
he was 'spitting blood' about the Hochtief move.
In 1990, Eurorail's plan for an alternative link was turned down by the
transport secretary because the public subsidy required by the companies was
thought too high. In May this year GEC joined the largely British consortium
which is still fighting to win the contract.
The government issued a consultation paper earlier this year on how best to
harness the private sector for the project. The DoT this week appointed Hill
Samuel, the merchant bank, to co-ordinate the transfer of the project to the
private sector.

FT  11 AUG 93 / World News in Brief: Franc under pressure against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc had another difficult day as currency traders continued to
question the government's gradual approach to cutting interest rates. It
lost over a centime against the D-Mark in morning trading, and despite
attempts to rally during the afternoon, closed in London at FFr3.521 against
the D-Mark compared to Monday's close of FFr3.507. It rallied in late New
York trading and in early Pacific region trading, where it stood at
FFr3.5125. Traders did not think the pressure on the franc was likely to let
up in the near future, even if France opted for faster and more significant
interest rate cuts. Ironically, lower rates would equally reduce the French
currency's attractiveness to investors in the short term.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Karadzic threatens all-out war if Nato attacks Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and GILLIAN TETT

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN SERB leader Mr Radovan Karadzic warned yesterday that Nato air
strikes against Serb targets could unleash an all-out war which would leave
his Moslem rivals with no territory.
'If a single bomb strikes a Serbian position, there would be no more talks.
We would have an all-out war and catastrophe,' he said. 'The attack would
trigger a huge battle and chaos. There would be tremendous suffering on all
three sides.'
Mr Karadzic added that he would probably lose control of Bosnian Serb
militiamen, apparently playing on the fears of Britain, France and Canada,
whose United Nations troops on the ground could face retaliation by Serb
forces.
His comments came in an interview after the international mediators, Lord
Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, postponed talks because Serb forces had
not withdrawn from strategic Mount Igman, west of Sarajevo.
French UN troops later said Bosnian Serb militiamen had retaken positions
they had vacated the previous day on mounts Igman and Bjelasnica - a move
that deepened international frustration about Serb manoeuvring. But as Nato
finalised its military preparations for possible strikes, after its meeting
on Monday which approved the logistics for strikes, officials admitted that
action was unlikely in the next couple of days.
Before any strikes can start, the UN, Nato or a member of the alliance must
make a specific appeal for action, which must then receive final
authorisation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general.
US officials yesterday said they would be pushing for Mr Boutros Ghali to
approve action quickly, amid suspicions that the European allies still
lacked political will to press on with the strikes.
But speaking at his lakeside hotel in Geneva, Mr Karadzic denounced as
'absolutely irresponsible' western threats to launch air strikes. He said it
encouraged Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic to hold out for military
intervention and derail talks on the republic's ethnic partition.
Mr Izetbegovic has refused to return to the negotiating table with Serb and
Croat adversaries until Serb forces withdraw from the strategic heights
above Sarajevo.
He appears to be waiting to see whether Nato will push ahead with the air
strikes. He yesterday criticised Lord Owen for his cautious response to
Nato's threat. 'I am not satisfied with Owen's statement on air strikes. In
this way they (the mediators) are supporting the other side. This is counter
productive,' he said.
An angry Mr Karadzic warned: 'If Izetbegovic continues to sabotage the
talks, he will lose everything.'
Russia announced yesterday it was contacting the US and leaders in former
Yugoslavia to try to avert the use of outside force.
Russia has traditionally sympathised with the Serbs, although moderate
politicians around President Boris Yeltsin have been anxious not to let this
undermine improved relations with the west.
As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia would have crucial
influence over whether air strikes should be authorised in Bosnia.

FT  11 AUG 93 / BOC warning blunts market euphoria: Share price falls as
gases company predicts decline in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON equity market's euphoria over world economic recovery was damped
yesterday by a profits warning from the BOC Group, the UK-based industrial
gases giant.
BOC described the world economic environment as 'disappointing' and said its
profits would be slightly down for the year to September 30, despite help
from the fall in sterling. Its shares fell 9 per cent in heavy trading.
The industrial gases industry, which supplies such basic gases as oxygen and
nitrogen to manufacturing and construction companies, is seen as a reliable
indicator of economic activity. BOC, the world's fourth largest gases
company, has the bulk of its sales outside the UK.
The company, where Mr Patrick Rich has been chief executive since January
1992, said profits in the first nine months of the current financial year
had risen by 4 per cent.
It added, however: 'The US recovery in the last few months has slowed,
recovery in Australia has stalled, the Japanese economy is still affected by
policy paralysis and, while the UK shows recovery, its focus seems to be on
sectors which have so far had relatively little impact on gas demand.'
BOC said that whereas there was growth in sales to the food and drink
industries, there was still depressed demand for gas cylinders in such basic
industries as cutting, welding, metal fabrication and construction.
Commenting on the share price reaction, the company said: 'The market has
the bit between its teeth on economic recovery, and people have been
disappointed by what they see as the rather gloomy tone of our statement.
But we are being realistic in reporting what we see in the market place.'
There was also pressure on BOC's medical business in the US, partly due to
the Clinton administration's attempts to control healthcare costs.
Forane, its leading anaesthetic, came off patent in the US in January and
became subject to generic competition.
Since then, BOC said, it had lost up to 42 per cent of its market. The loss
should reach 50 per cent in the reasonably near future, though it was then
expected to stabilise.
Its new anaesthetic, Suprane, which went on sale in the US in April, would
not contribute significantly to earnings for some time, the company said.
BOC said its vacuum business, which supplies the semiconductor industry, had
benefited from an upturn in the US electronics industry and sterling's
devaluation last September.
The division, which exports from the UK, had seen its profits nearly double
this year. 'The exchange rate has helped, and we've taken full advantage of
it,' BOC said.
The company also argued that economic statistics made it clear that recovery
was under way in several of its main markets, and that this should help the
gases business eventually. 'When our customers start doing better, we'll get
the benefits,' it said. 'We hope that won't take too long.'
BOC shares finished the day 63p lower at 651p.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which had risen to record heights over the past week on
hopes of economic recovery and the prospect of rate cuts in the wake of the
currency turmoil in Europe, had looked poised yesterday to break through
3,000 after gaining in 12 of the previous 13 trading sessions.
In the event, the index closed down 14.8 points at 2,971.6.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Bank concern over borrowing: Calls for tax increase boosted
by need to hold the line on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGUMENTS for a tax rise in the November Budget strengthened last night
after the Bank of England warned that the chances of Britain maintaining its
better inflation record could be jeopardised by spiralling government
borrowing.
The Bank said in its quarterly inflation report that the Treasury's favoured
measure of underlying inflation - the year-on-year increase in the retail
prices index, excluding mortgage payments - was likely to stay below the
government's 4 per cent target ceiling over the next two years.
The prospect of underlying inflation dropping to the lower part of the
government's 1-4 per cent target range over the next four years was 'within
reach' as long as the government maintained tight control of fiscal and
monetary policies.
The Bank warned, however, that government borrowing, adjusted for inflation
and expressed as a proportion of national output, was higher than at any
time since the second world war. It warned this 'must be tackled' to keep
the confidence of financial markets.
The report said the deficit excluding interest payments was 'much larger' as
a percentage of national output than in any other member of the Group of
Seven industrial nations, which comprises Britain, the US, Germany, Japan,
Canada, France and Italy.
Unless Britain took action to bring revenues and spending 'closer to
balance' the possibility of deficits staying high for some time could damage
the credibility of anti-inflationary policies. That could follow from
worries in capital markets that the government might finance the deficits by
printing money.
The Bank left open whether it favoured a tax rise in November for the next
financial year, to come on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of extra taxation already
due next April. But it said in the report further fiscal action 'may be
required'.
While relatively upbeat about the UK recovery in the first half of the year,
the Bank said domestic and overseas demand was 'uneven' and could be
adversely affected by the weakening economies in continental Europe.
It gave a clear hint that in spite of signs of a slowing in the pace of
recovery in the past two months, a cut in interest rates over the next month
or so is unlikely to be considered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
The Bank's quarterly inflation report was launched early this year as part
of a government effort to win greater public confidence in its economic
policies. In it, the Bank comments openly about inflation, though stops
short of divulging policy advice to the Treasury. The remarks appear to
increase the chances that Mr Clarke, on the back of reduced worries about
inflation, may ease borrowing conditions closer to the time of the November
Budget. Any cuts in base rates, held at 6 per cent since January, might
partially compensate for the demand-sapping effect of a rise in taxation in
the Budget to curb the Pounds 50bn budget deficit.
The Bank said expectations about rising prices had moderated in recent
months, partly because of high short-term unemployment and a large number of
companies operating below capacity. Also the impact of the fall in sterling
on import prices had been offset by a reduction in unit labour costs as
Britain embarked on 'gradual recovery'. In June, the underlying measure of
inflation stood at 2.8 per cent.
The Bank said Britain still had some way to go before establishing the
credibility of its anti-inflationary policies. It said the recent relaxation
in the exchange rate mechanism might bring about lower rates in the medium
term in the rest of Europe.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Karadzic warns of war if Nato air strikes go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN SERB leader Mr Radovan Karadzic warned yesterday that Nato air
strikes against Serb targets could unleash an all-out war which would leave
his Moslem rivals with no territory.
'If a single bomb strikes a Serbian position, there would be no more talks.
We would have an all-out war and catastrophe,' he said.
'The attack would trigger a huge battle, and chaos. There would be
tremendous suffering on all three sides.'
'I would probably lose control of the central (army) command,' he added in
an apparent attempt to play on the fears of Britain, France and Canada whose
United Nations troops on the ground could face retaliation by Serb forces.
His comments came in an interview after international mediators Lord Owen
and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg had postponed talks because Serb forces had not
withdrawn from strategic Mount Igman, west of Sarajevo.
But as Nato finalised its military preparations for possible air strikes,
afterits meeting on Monday which approved the logistics for strikes,
officials admitted that action was unlikely in the next couple of days.
Before any strikes can start, the UN, Nato or a member of the alliance must
make a specific appeal for action, which must then receive final
authorisation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general.
US officials yesterday said they would be pushing for Mr Boutros Ghali to
approve action quickly, amid suspicions that its European allies still
lacked the political will to press ahead with the strikes.
But speaking at his lakeside hotel in Geneva, Mr Karadzic denounced as
'absolutely irresponsible' western threats to launch air strikes. He said it
encouraged Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic to hold out for military
intervention and derail talks on the republic's ethnic partition.
Mr Izetbegovic has refused to return to the negotiating table with Serb and
Croat adversaries until Serb forces complete their withdrawal from strategic
heights above Sarajevo.
He appears to be waiting to see whether Nato will now push ahead with the
air strikes. He yesterday criticised Lord Owen for his cautious response to
Nato's threat.
'I am not satisfied with Owen's statement on air strikes. In this way they
(the mediators) are supporting the other side. This is counter productive,'
he said.
An angry Mr Karadzic warned: 'If Izetbegovic continues to sabotage the
talks, he will lose everything.'
It was unclear if Mr Karadzic had followed up a request from Lord Owen
yesterday morning to order Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic to
speed up the withdrawal of troops from a key area overlooking the besieged
Sarajevo.
Earlier in the day two delegations from the UN peacekeeping forces in
Sarajevo visited the mountain to assess the Serb withdrawal.
But UN commander Barry Frewer in Sarajevo said the Serb army had not yet
complied with its pledge to pull back from Mount Igman, which is crucial to
the mainly Moslem Bosnian army because of a military supply route.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rexmore highlights recovery potential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rexmore, the contract furnishings group, is forecasting a substantial
recovery in earnings in the current year following the elimination of timber
losses, lower interest charges and a reduced tax charge.
'We have achieved a number of aims', said Mr Abraham Rosenblatt, chairman.
The objective for the current year was to consolidate on the success of
contract furnishing. The first four months showed a significant improvement.
In the year to April 3 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.36m
(Pounds 896,000) after total costs of Pounds 2.4m relating to the
discontinued timber side. Continuing activities made operating profits of
Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.79m) from turnover of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 30.2m).
Interest charges were cut to Pounds 649,000 (Pounds 916,000). Bank
borrowings had been reduced by Pounds 2.6m and year-end gearing was down
from 44.4 per cent to 13.9 per cent.
Losses per share worked through at 7.7p (7p) but the dividend is held at
1.75p with an unchanged final of 1.05p.

MURRAY Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund manager, has raised Pounds 30m from
institutions for a new fund to finance management buy-outs and acquisitions.
The Murray Johnstone Private Acquisitions Partnership is a limited
partnership under English law and intends to invest in unquoted acquisition
financings in the UK, principally buy-outs and buy-ins.
A number of UK, Canadian and US investors have subscribed to the first
closing, Murray Johnstone said, and a further closing which could raise a
similar amount will take place in the autumn.
MJPAP is the successor to the Murray Johnstone LBO Fund which raised Dollars
102m in 1988.
It is now fully invested and has returned about 50 per cent of subscriptions
to its investors following the flotation of Burn Stewart, a whisky company,
and of Yorkshire Food Group, as well as a number of sales of holdings.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: The cake that may need reslicing - How new
disclosure rulings have hit life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury has dropped a bombshell on the life insurance industry by
ruling that, for the first time, companies would have to tell prospective
policyholders how much the product costs, how much the sales agent will be
paid and what penalties will bite if it is surrendered before maturity.
That announcement prompted a sell-off in life insurance company shares which
has yet to correct itself.
The Treasury was responding to a report from the Office of Fair Trading
which had concluded that the current disclosure regime for life insurers had
'significant anti-competitive elements' and that consumers knew too little
about what they were buying to choose products wisely.
And while the industry strove to put on a brave face, the stock market
showed clearly why life insurers have fought tooth and nail against
disclosure rules which were proposed as long ago as 1988.
Before the Treasury's announcement, the life insurance sector was trading at
a 48 per cent premium to the FT-A All-Share Index, close to its historical
high. Within two days, the premium had fallen by 14 percentage points to 34
per cent, an unusually large drop for the sector.
'These insurance companies haven't really lived in a fully competitive
environment before,' said Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance industry analyst at
Morgan Stanley. 'And how managements face up to that will decide who
survives.'
The absence of competition in an industry with a plethora of competitors is
a bit of a conundrum. But because customers are unaware of the price of the
products they buy, firms have found it makes more sense to compete for sales
agents than to compete for ultimate buyers.
Analysts believe that the new transparency requirements will for the first
time expose to buyers the unattractive elements of some of the industry's
most profitable and widely sold products, particularly, mortgage-linked
endowment policies.
Moreover, sales agents of all types will have to disclose to customers the
substantial commissions they receive on each sale - a development which some
analysts feel could drive customers into other savings media.
'Some endowments which would have been sold will not be sold,' said Mr Roman
Cizden, analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court. 'When the husband and wife
go to their insurance salesman they will fall off their chairs when they see
those numbers. They are so big,' Mr Cizden said.
A 25-year mortgage endowment with a Pounds 50 per month premium will give
the average insurance salesman a minimum Pounds 486 commission up front,
with many receiving up to twice that amount. And all of that comes out of
the policyholders' funds.
Endowments are probably the single most profitable product life insurers
sell, analysts say. They were roughly 75 per cent of the market in 1992 and
of these, mortgage-related endowments were nearly 60 per cent. Other
products, such as single-premium bonds and pensions policies have been
gaining ground on endowments in recent years, but carry smaller profit
margins. 'Pensions business has a smaller profit margin than endowments and
single-premium products are less profitable than both.'
Thus, companies will have to increase volumes of lower-margin business and
slash expenses in order to stay profitable. And the less efficient,
particularly mutuals without access to the capital markets, will find it
difficult to survive.
According to Mr Nick Anderton, a consulting actuary and publisher of an
industry newsletter, up to 20 life insurance companies are currently on the
auction block following several mergers already announced earlier this year.
Meanwhile, analysts say that companies such as the Prudential, which have
already embarked on significant cost reduction programmes, are likely to
have an edge in the new competitive environment.
Mr Ziai is forecasting that those companies who already have a niche selling
to either high income individuals or to the relatively poor will experience
the least competition. But those who concentrate on the middle market, the
C2s and Ds, will have to struggle to maintain market share.
Companies such as Britannic Life or London and Manchester Life Assurance,
which have done well in so-called Industrial branch business  - in which an
agent makes weekly collections of small premiums - are selling a product
which is not likely to be price-sensitive. 'The same agent has probably been
selling policies in the same street for years. Everybody knows him and he
probably sells to two or three members of the same family,' Mr Ziai said.
However, although there is little competition for this business, there is
also little profit in it. Several companies, including Britannic, have had
to raise their minimum monthly premiums because they calculated they could
not earn money on small sums. Both the Prudential and Britannic did so last
year, and consequently reported drops of IB sales in the first half of 1993
of 12 per cent and 66 per cent respectively.
But Mr Cizden argues that from an investor's point of view, the heightened
industry competitiveness could be a good thing. It will narrow the field,
leaving those who survive with a larger market share. 'I will argue that in
the future, the cake will be sliced differently,' he said.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Language training limits BPP's rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance in professional training services helped BPP, the
education and training group, increase pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to
Pounds 3.34m on sales ahead just 3 per cent at Pounds 24m for the first half
of 1993.
That compared with profits last time of Pounds 2.97m on turnover of Pounds
23.3m.
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said the first half had been held back from
being extremely good by losses at Linguarama, the language training
business. He was optimistic about prospects for the rest of the group.
'In the last three years we have increased profits each year against a
rotten UK recession,' he said. 'We are determined that 1993 will see BPP
continue its unbroken record.'
Linguarama incurred an operating loss of Pounds 40,000 against profits of
Pounds 620,000. Mr Price said he expected it to return a profit for the full
year following last year's restructuring.
He warned, however, that Linguarama faced a tougher time in continental
Europe, where economies were deteriorating further.
Professional training, which offers courses in accountancy, law and banking,
returned profits of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 522,000). Mr Price said BPP was
beginning to reap the benefits of introducing courses in banking and law
within the last 18 months.
Publishing recorded a 28 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds
1.4m (Pounds 1.09m), while academic training showed an Pounds 84,000 rise to
Pounds 584,000.
Net cash at the end of the period was more than Pounds 10m.
The interim dividend is increased from 2.7p to 3p from earnings up 0.4p at
7.6p.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram still in discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING Ram said yesterday it was still in discussion with Masco Corporation,
the US building products group which has been considering making a bid for
the bathrooms and kitchens group.
However, the Yorkshire-based company said contacts had been of a preliminary
nature and it was unlikely that any decision or announcement would be made
for some time. Both companies had agreed that they required further detailed
analysis and review before they reviewed their respective positions.
Spring Ram also concluded there would be no merit in pursuing discussions at
this stage with any of the other parties which expressed an interest in the
company.
Mr Roger Regan, who became chairman a fortnight ago, said: 'Regardless of
the outcome of the discussions with Masco, I believe in the strengths of the
company's core businesses which will benefit from the extensive capital
investment made over the last few years.'
Mr Regan has initiated a full operational and financial review which is
expected to be completed before the announcement of interim results on
September 22.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank's accounts criticised by
watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland was yesterday criticised by the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, for an entry in its 1992
results which nearly doubled profits.
The bank introduced a change of accounting policy in 1991 which had the
effect of substantially lifting 1992 profits but which should have been
shown instead in the 1991 accounts.
The panel said the treatment breached SSAP 6, the accounting standard
dealing with prior year adjustments, and ruled that the amount should have
been shown in the previous year.
The accounts had received an unqualified opinion by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
auditors.
The bank has agreed to amend the comparative 1992 figures in its 1993
accounts and to include appropriate explanatory notes. That will reduce 1992
profits by more than Pounds 9m.
The panel held back from issuing a stronger reprimand or requiring the bank
to re-issue the disputed accounts to shareholders as it did in one previous
case.
Royal Bank changed its accounting policies in October 1991 to defer
acquisition expenses in its insurance operations over the period in which
premiums were earned.
The effect was a one-off boost to profits for 1991 and prior years of Pounds
9.1m. But the bank took the gain as an exceptional item in its accounts for
the year to September 30 1992, which lifted pre-tax profits for the year to
Pounds 20.9m.
The review panel had no objection to the new accounting policy, which the
bank argued was in line with market practice and the statement of
recommended practice of the Association of British Insurers.
Mr Robert Speirs, finance director of Royal Bank, stressed yesterday that
the adjustment was not concealed but was clearly flagged in the accounts as
an exceptional item. The bank had sought advice from accountants before
using the approach. 'This was purely a technical matter,' he said.
The criticism of Royal Bank follows a reprimand at the end of last month
against Breverleigh Investments, which breached three separate accounting
standards in its accounts for the year to June 30 1992.
Breverleigh failed to provide a cash flow statement, did not consolidate a
subsidiary, Banyan Tree of Key West, and did not include a statement in the
accounts that they had been prepared in accordance with applicable
accounting standards.
The accounts were not qualified on these grounds by Copeland &amp; Co, the
auditors.
The directors accepted that the departures from accounting standards were
not justified and assured the panel there would be full compliance in the
future. The 1992 figures will be adjusted accordingly in the 1993 accounts.
Banyan, which was 77.5 per cent owned by Breverleigh, had net liabilities of
Pounds 339,000 and showed a loss for the year of Pounds 279,000. Breverleigh
showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 887 before an extraordinary loss of Pounds
198,000.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Williams buys Aqualisa via Pounds 23.5m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings is expanding its shower manufacturing side through the
acquisition of Aqualisa Products for Pounds 23.5m.
The business will complement Williams' Heatrae Sadia offshoot, which markets
showers under the Gainsborough and Heatrae Sadia brands.
Net assets of Aqualisa are expected to be Pounds 3.2m at completion and the
consideration is subject to a net asset adjustment dependent upon completion
accounts. The price will be met by the issue of 2.8m shares - unchanged
yesterday at 336p - and cash.
For the year ended September 30 1992 Aqualisa made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 1.8m on turnover of Pounds 13.2m. Despite the present poor trading
environment in the UK it is expected to improve this year.
Aqualisa was founded in 1976 to market a valve which enabled consumers to
experience a more powerful shower.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BOC down 8% in third quarter - Slowdown
prompts warning over outcome for full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC GROUP, the industrial gases producer, reported a sharp slowdown in
profits for its third quarter to end-June.
Pre-tax profits in the quarter were down 8 per cent at Pounds 81.5m.
The company also warned that full year profits were unlikely to match last
year's.
Profits for the nine months to end-June were up 4 per cent at Pounds 261.6m
(Pounds 250.9m), on sales ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 2.4bn.
However, at constant exchange rates profits would have been down 1 per cent,
while sales would have risen by only 6 per cent, the company said.
BOC said its gases business in the quarter suffered from a disappointing
economic environment worldwide.
The environment for health care was similarly lethargic. However, it had
continued to expand in new areas, acquiring industrial gas businesses in
Poland and Germany.
Forane, the group's long-established anaesthetic - which lost its patent
protection in the US market early this year - was now expected to lose half
its US market to generic competition.
It would be some time before Suprane, BOC's new anaesthetic which has been
on sale in the US since April, made a significant contribution to profits.
The vacuum technology business showed a sharp improvement, with operating
profits in the nine months almost doubled. This was mostly due to recovery
in the semiconductor market, which BOC supplies from its Edwards High Vacuum
subsidiary.
Recovery was most marked in more sophisticated processor chips made in the
US. The Japanese market, which is more biased to basic memory chips, had not
seen the same pick-up.
Nine month operating profits on gases were Pounds 228.5m (Pounds 217m) on
sales of Pounds 1.7bn (Pounds 1.49bn). Healthcare operating profits were
Pounds 73.7m (Pounds 73m) on sales of Pounds 442.6m (Pounds 388.4m). Profits
on the vacuum business and distribution were Pounds 23m (Pounds 12.2m) on
sales of Pounds 256.2m (Pounds 201.9m).
After interest charges of Pounds 64.2m (Pounds 54.9m), tax of Pounds 89.6m
(Pounds 83.3m) and minorities of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 9.6m), net profit was
Pounds 157.6m (Pounds 158m). Earnings per share were 33.24p (33.47p).

FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Allied Irish Banks advances to
IPounds 139m - US market continues to be focus of future growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED IRISH Banks, the Republic of Ireland's main clearing bank, reported a
42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 138.6m (Pounds 130m) for
the half year to June 30.
The group has changed its financial year to end-December and the comparable
Pounds 97.4m is for the six months to September 30 1992.
A strong performance in the capital markets division, which contributed
IPounds 33.1m - a 38 per cent increase - and an overall 12.5 per cent
reduction in non-performing loans, equivalent to IPounds 95m on a constant
currency translation basis, were the main reasons for the advance.
In addition, the 1992 figures were deflated by an exceptional IPounds 13.9m,
which if excluded would give a pre-tax increase of a more modest 24.5 per
cent.
The surprise in the results was the return to profitability of the British
division, which showed a IPounds 2m pre-tax profit compared with a IPounds
17.2m loss, a recovery which was not expected until the second half of 1993.
Mr Gerald Scanlan, chief executive, said 'the lower interest rate
environment in Britain has meant that customers there are now better able to
service loans.'
A sharp reduction in non-performing loans and loan loss provisions had
therefore brought the division back to profitability, he said.
However, he predicted that there would be little volume growth in business
for the remainder of the year, either in the UK or in the group's core
market in Ireland where profits declined by 11.9 per cent to IPounds 73.9m.
'We will first need to see an improvement in performance of (Ireland's) main
trading partners,' he said.
The US market, where its First Maryland Bancorp subsidiary reported a 37 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 93.2m (Pounds 62.5m), continues
to be the focus of AIB's growth strategy.
Mr Scanlan said that the move into the US market was 'to find our growth
outside the Irish market. We are continuously looking for acquisition
opportunities in the Washington, Baltimore and Maryland area.'
An increase of only 7.9 per cent in the interim dividend to 4.1p was a
source of disappointment to some analysts, but as one pointed out: 'They are
retaining profits to build a war chest for acquisitions.'
Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent to 12.9p.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Manchester Ship Canal shows 27% downturn to
Pounds 5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER Ship Canal reported a 27 per cent decline in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 5.7m, for the half year to end-June.
The result, which came from turnover of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.5m), was
struck after an exceptional credit of Pounds 470,000 (Pounds 960,000)
relating to the release of a Pounds 1.58m provision for dredging the Mersey
which is no longer required, less a charge of Pounds 1.1m in respect of
voluntary severance costs.
Last year, the directors pointed out, there was also a surplus of Pounds
2.1m from the sale of fixed assets at the Ellesmere Port container terminal.
The company is 82.2 per cent-owned by Peel Holdings, the Rochdale-based
property developer which is offering to buy out the minority for an eventual
Pounds 33.50 per share.
The offer has the support of Stancroft Trust, the largest outside
shareholder.
The company is expected to be absorbed into Peel and will lose its
quotation.
Earnings per share fell to 121.3p (182.5p).

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bensons lists on low tide of doubled losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BENSONS CRISPS, conceived in wartime austerity, yesterday splashed out on a
shipboard press lunch, as the company listed on a low tide of doubled
pre-tax losses made in the company's weaker first half.
It was all a world away from Mr Sidney Benson, the fish and chip shop
proprietor who fought a 1940s oil shortage with lard and ensured an unbroken
supply of crisps for the people of Wigan, founding the snack maker at the
same time.
The 'informal press luncheon', aboard the Honourable Company of Master
Mariners Headquarters Ship, the HMS Wellington, was probably not meant as
ironic allusion to the late, lush eighties.
Mr Tony Fiddian, the finance director presiding over losses of Pounds
386,000 (Pounds 191,000) for the six months to May 29, said: 'It's a matter
of honour. We turn out whether the news is good or bad.'
The losses were struck on turnover up at Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 15.6m). The
increase in sales was entirely due to supermarkets and discounters, in line
with the general trend.
In the independent sector, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of
Bensons' sales, Golden Wonder, owned by Dalgety, had taken market share by
slashing prices to 1970s levels.
Sight and Sound, the company's small animation offshoot, suffered from a
last minute cancellation as a result of which it also lost money.
Nevertheless, the interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p, although losses
per share deepened to 3.2p (1.7p).
All this on top of a first half typically weakened by seasonally high potato
prices, means Bensons could be forgiven for describing its results as
disappointing, but not surprising.
However, Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman, said the second half 'is beginning to
take on a more positive shape'.
Despite this, Bensons' shares ended the day 7p lower at 62p.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Russell Hobbs behind 88% leap at Pifco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance by its Russell Hobbs brand enabled Pifco, the
electrical appliances group, to report a 88 per cent increase in annual
profits.
The pre-tax outcome for the 12 months to April 30 rose from Pounds 1.17m to
Pounds 2.2m on sales of Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 40m).
Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said: 'Improved efficiency and profitability at
Russell Hobbs and tight control on all costs throughout the group was
responsible for the rise in profits.'
As part of the rationalisation the workforce was reduced by 12 per cent,
leading to the loss of 78 jobs. The company ended the year with a net cash
balance of Pounds 4.6m.
In the 28 months before the group acquired Russell Hobbs it incurred losses
of Pounds 31m. Mr Webber conceded that analysts had been nervous about the
purchase, believing it to be either a big lead forward or big mistake. 'I
believe we have now proved it has been a success' he said.
Tax charge remained low at 5 per cent because of accumulated losses at
Russell Hobbs.
Pifco is exploring potential acquisitions in the European small appliance
industry. 'Timing is everything' said Mr Webber, 'but there could be some
good buys in Germany where many of the family businesses are thinking twice
about their options.'
He described consumer confidence in the UK as 'fragile and erratic' with
margins under pressure.
The company is planning to launch a number of products at the bottom end of
the market to co-exist with its premium brands such as Russell Hobbs and
Carmen.
Earnings per share rose to 25.5p (13.9p). The final dividend is raised to
4.75p making a total of 8.25p (7.75p).

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Citibank to sell UK life unit to Cannon
Lincoln
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIBANK is to withdraw from the UK life insurance underwriting business and
is selling its Citibank Life Assurance unit to Cannon Lincoln, the UK life
insurance subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation of Indiana.
Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
Just 18 months ago, Citibank made a significant push into the UK life
business by acquiring the sales force of MI Group, a 700-strong sales team
known for its hard-sell approach and reliance on cold-calling customers.
At the time, Citibank Life had assets under management of Pounds 100m, which
have since grown to Pounds 250m.
Since then, Citibank has injected fresh capital into the subsidiary, most
recently a Pounds 3.25m addition within the past few months, according to Mr
Paul Curran, head of UK consumer banking for Citibank.
Mr Curran said the move reflects the continuing rationalisation of the
bank's operations worldwide. 'While we think life and pensions businesses
are key, we don't think we need to be in underwriting,' he said.
Citibank will continue as a 'tied agent' of the new combined entity, selling
its products exclusively through its branches. Also, Cannon Lincoln sales
agents will have access to Citibank customer lists and in turn, will offer
some retail Citibank products, such as short term deposit accounts and
mortgages to its own customers.
The move is part of a growing tide of rationalisation in the UK life
insurance business, spurred on by tighter disclosure regulations which are
expected to heighten competition among firms.
For its part, Cannon Lincoln said the acquisition is part of its strategy to
play a significant part in the UK life insurance business.
The combined businesses will have assets under management of over Pounds
965m and will become the 16th largest seller of unit-linked life and
pensions products in Britain. It will have a combined sales force of 1,428
directly employed sales agents and 1,040 tied sales agents who sell Cannon
Lincoln products exclusively but who are not directly employed by the
company.
After the acquisition, Cannon Lincoln will have 80 branch offices, up from
the current 30, and its head office staff will roughly double to 720.
Cannon Lincoln said there were currently no plans for rationalisation of
staff following the acquisition.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Currency gains help Saatchi to Pounds 9m -
Shift in spending patterns means uncertain outlook for worldwide advertising
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY gains boosted interim sales and profits at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the
heavily-indebted advertising group, which yesterday reported a Pounds 7.4m
increase in the pre-tax return to Pounds 9.1m.
The profits advance was achieved on revenue up 11.5 per cent to Pounds 404m
for the six months to June 30. Favourable currency movements had been
responsible for virtually all of the 13.4 per cent improvement in continuing
operations.
Mr Charles Scott, the accountant who took over as chief executive of the
world's fourth largest advertising agency in April, said that in spite of
the currency gains the interim results showed a group 'improving steadily
from a financial viewpoint'. Revenue for the current year was expected to be
broadly similar to last year's Pounds 748m, excluding currency movements.
He warned against complacency, however, saying that a shift in the spending
patterns of customers away from short bursts of promotional activity to more
sustained value for money branding 'could disrupt . . . traditional
expenditure patterns'. The worldwide outlook for advertising growth 'is
uncertain,' he added.
Net debt had fallen from Pounds 192m at the end of 1992 to Pounds 177m at
June 30 following the Pounds 73m rights issue. Mr Scott said the group aimed
to reduce borrowings to Pounds 145m by the end of 1993.
He re-emphasised his commitment to paying a dividend in 1994. Earnings per
share were 1.9p (4.9p losses).
Mr Scott said much remained to be done to improve the group, particularly in
light of the downturn in Europe. 'We still need to get our costs down in
some areas.'
Margins had fallen from a peak of 5.5 per cent in the first half of 1992 to
4.7 per cent. This was expected to rise to 6 per cent by the end of the
year, after further cost-cutting, and to 10 per cent by the end of 1995.
Saatchi, which has cut staff by 5 per cent to 11,900 in the last 18 months,
is expected to seek further reductions in Europe and possibly the US.
Continental Europe had suffered most severely in the first half,
particularly Spain. Trading profits were more than halved from Pounds 9.7m
to Pounds 4.5m. The 33 per cent increase in profits from the US to Pounds
10.8m was mainly because of currency gains. Underlying revenue growth
remained flat.
The most encouraging signs came from the UK and Pacific region. Although UK
revenues fell 3 per cent, trading profits were up from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds
3.1m.
The group's stronger financial position meant that it would begin to focus
on investing the rights issue money, Mr Scott said. One of the first targets
would be to build up the Zenith media buying company in to a global concern.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Advertising upturn lifts CIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA GROUP, the independent advertising media buyer, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 1.87m to Pounds 1.89m in the six months to
June 30, as clients returned to more normal budget patterns.
Mr Chris Ingram, chairman, said: 'Half year comparisons with 1992 have been
adversely affected by a shift in our business towards the second half of the
year, after an unusually even split last year.'
He said all companies in the group would show increased sales in the
full-year.
Turnover rose to Pounds 122.9m (Pounds 116.3m) on the back of increased
spending by clients and new business. Mr Ingram said: 'There are some small
signs of the recession ending in the UK, but we are seeing recessionary
patterns in continental Europe.'
Operating and administration costs increased to Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 4.94m),
reflecting investment in new senior management and start-up costs of the
Billett Consultancy business.
Investment income was lower at Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 753,000) as UK
interest rates fell and cash decreased to Pounds 7m (Pounds 8m), mainly
because of CIA's purchase of a 45 per cent stake in Blufin of Italy.
The interim dividend goes up to 1.46p (1.32p), payable from earnings of 8.3p
(8.59p) per share.

FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Brit Land signs Soros link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BINDING agreement to set up a property partnership between British Land
and the Quantum Fund, headed by Mr George Soros, has been signed 10 weeks
after it was first announced, writes Vanessa Houlder.
The delay in finalising stemmed partly from the complexity of the tax and
legal arrangements, complicated by Quantum's move from the Netherlands
Antilles to the Cayman Islands.
The final agreement has given British Land the right to to buy Quantum's
interest, once the investing phase of the partnership, which is expected to
have funds of at least Pounds 1bn, is complete. If British Land decides not
to buy out its partner, Quantum may do so.
British Land said that the importance of the new clause was that it allowed
it to plan its finances ahead for the exit. In its preliminary form, the
partnership was expected to be ended through the liquidation of the
property.

FT  11 AUG 93 / New management finds extra Ferruzzi losses
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second biggest private sector
company, has revised its losses for the first five months of this year to
more than double the previous L491.6bn (Pounds 205m).
The new deficit of L1,165bn follows the investigation of alleged cover-ups
of losses by the group's former management, and of bribes to political
parties.
The new management, imposed by the group's main bank creditors, said about
L645bn of losses had been ascertained only recently. It called in Deloitte
and Touche, the international auditors, in June to re-examine the books.
Ferfin is staggering under about L31,000bn debt.
The management plans to slash the group's nominal share value to only L5
from L1,000. The plan, which is likely to be approved by shareholders,
involves reducing Ferfin's share capital to L205bn, from L1,370bn. It is
then proposed that the shares be consolidated on the basis of 200 for one to
restore the nominal value.
Trading in the shares of both Ferfin and its Montedison industrial
subsidiary was suspended yesterday pending the announcement.
Ferfin's revised losses are believed to take account of two separate events,
both previously hidden from shareholders, involving the longstanding
existence of what amounts to a parallel set of books.
The bulk of the additional losses stems from Ferfin's complex commodity
trading operations.
Leaked testimony from former executives - now co-operating with Milan
magistrates investigating political corruption - has suggested that Mr Raul
Gardini, the former head of Ferfin who shot himself last month, covered up
between Dollars 350m and Dollars 450m of losses in US commodity futures
trading in 1989.
The new audits have resulted in a L245bn write-down in the capital of the
group's main trading subsidiary; the discovery of a L84bn 'irrecoverable'
loan by one of its offshoots; and a L165bn foreign exchange loss by another
trading operation.
Together, the new losses are in line with the 'shortfall' of between Dollars
250m and Dollars 270m in Ferfin's accounts to July 1991 alleged by Mr
Gardini in a file in his personal computer. The file, which was compiled
just before his death, was believed to be for Milan magistrates.
Ferfin's new management has also adjusted the group's results to reflect
irregularities arising after Mr Gardini stepped down. For instance, it is
not recognising L79.3bn in assumed 1993 royalties from the Erbamont
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, sold to Sweden's Procordia group in March.

<TEXT>
GENERAL ACCIDENT, the Perth-based insurer, demonstrated the strength of
recovery in the general insurance sector when it unveiled its first pre-tax
profit since 1989.
The pre-tax figure of Pounds 126.2m for the first six months of the year
represented a turnround from a Pounds 15.4m loss.
Though the result was ahead of expectations, the market was disappointed at
the company's decision to leave its interim dividend unchanged at 9.7p.
Earnings per share were 21.5p, against a loss of 3.4p last time.
The share price slipped 9p to 683p.
Mr Nelson Robertson, chief executive, applauded 'the achievement of an
underwriting profit in the UK' and expected the improvement to continue for
the rest of the year.
The company said the improvement reflected increases in premiums, more
selective underwriting, reductions in costs and a fall in claims, especially
those such as subsidence that are related to bad weather.
Premium rates for home and motor insurance have risen by an average of 40
per cent in the past two years.
Underwriting profits in the UK reached Pounds 3.5m for the half year
compared with a deficit of Pounds 104.8m. The improvement was achieved in
spite of losses of Pounds 13m from the Perth floods in January and a payout
(net of reinsurance) of Pounds 10m following the Bishopsgate bomb in London
in April.
The turnround helped trim overall underwriting losses to Pounds 129m
compared with a loss of Pounds 235.2m in 1992. Net investment income
(investment income less interest on loans) rose 9 per cent from Pounds
215.1m to Pounds 238.8m.
Losses from the group's estate agency operations fell from Pounds 9.9m to
Pounds 4.5m. Profits from life operations amounted to Pounds 20.9m, compared
with Pounds 14.6m.
General business premium income rose from Pounds 1.9bn to Pounds 2.12bn,
with life premiums up to Pounds 413.7m (Pounds 357m) making for a total of
Pounds 2.52bn (Pounds 2.26bn).
The value of shareholders' funds was strengthened as a result of recent
buoyancy in the equity and bond markets.
Shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 1.99bn at June 30, compared with
Pounds 1.63bn at the end of last year, with a further rise to Pounds 2.02bn
by 6 August 6.
Net asset value per share reached 394p on August 6 compared with 331p on
January 1, giving a solvency margin of 48.8 per cent, up from 41.5 per cent.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Liffe drops Globex talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), Europe's
largest derivatives exchange, has pulled out of negotiations to join Globex,
the after-hours electronic futures trading system.
The suspension of the year-long talks was described as 'mutually agreed'.
But the discussions were derailed two weeks ago when the Chicago Board of
Trade ruled that Liffe would not be able to list its successful German bond
contracts on the system.
'This does not bode well for Globex,' said one market participant. 'It shows
that the exchanges behind Globex are putting their own interests first.'
A year after the launch of Globex, France's Matif is the only futures
exchange to have listed its products on the system, which was jointly
developed by the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, at an
estimated cost of Dollars 80m. The bulk of the 200,000 contracts traded so
far this month were Matif products.
Liffe had been given a list of the products which it would be allowed to
trade on Globex which included its Bund future contracts - its second most
actively traded product.
In a memo to CME members, Mr Jack Sandner reported that: 'On July 21, 1993,
the Chicago Boad of Trade instructed me, as Chairman of Globex, to inform
Liffe that Bund futures and options should be withdrawn from the list of
products available to Liffe.'
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, described the decision to exclude the
Bund contracts as 'an insurmountable barrier' to Liffe joining Globex, even
though some other problems had been ironed out.
No senior CBOT officials were available to comment on the change of heart.
However, the CBOT gained approval from its regulator, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, to trade Bund and gilt futures several years ago.
Although these products have not yet been listed, the CBOT is believed to be
hoping to develop, and eventually list on Globex, its own Bund futures.
However, previous attempts by US exchanges to build up liquid markets in
European interest-rate products have not been successful.

FT  11 AUG 93 / BA operating profits withstand price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways reaffirmed its position as one of the strongest carriers in
the world yesterday as first-quarter figures showed operating profits at
Pounds 108m, up from Pounds 96m, in spite of continuing price wars in the
industry.
At the pre-tax level, however, profits were depressed by a jump in
borrowings which pushed BA's interest charge up from Pounds 8m to Pounds
42m. Pre-tax profits fell 31 per cent to Pounds 63m, down from Pounds 91m in
the first quarter of 1992.
BA said its passenger yield - a measure that would reflect poor sales or
heavy discounting - rose by 2.3 per cent to 6.17p per person per kilometre
in the three months to June 30 compared with a year earlier. Cargo rose 5.9
per cent to 15.65p per tonne per kilometre.
The increased debt followed payment for a stake in US carrier USAir and a
second interim dividend, which would normally have been paid as a final
dividend in the second quarter.
After a Pounds 442m rights issue in May, to help finance the USAir deal,
borrowings were Pounds 2.14bn, a fall of Pounds 312m on a year earlier.
BA continued to increase capacity ahead of demand, and passenger load
factor, a measure of how full each aircraft is, fell 2.6 percentage points
to 69 per cent.
Sir Colin Marshall, chairman, said that business remained 'under pressure
from too much capacity in the industry, offset by further exchange rate
benefits'.
The fall in the value of sterling against the dollar had brought a net
benefit to the company of about Pounds 20m, said Mr Derek Stevens, BA's
chief financial officer. 'This full year we expect to make a gain of Pounds
70m or Pounds 80m as a result of currency changes.'
BA continued to cut its payroll with the number of employees falling 1.1 per
cent to 49,481. It increased the number of aircraft in service by eight to
238.
Mr Peter Bergius, transport analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the figures
showed BA was continuing its 'stringent cost control'. He believed the
recovery in passenger yield would continue in the second quarter.
Earnings per share fell from 8.1p to 6.3p on a fully diluted basis.
BA's shares rose 14 1/2 p to 350p.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Commercial logic drives hostility into the shade: The three
Rs replace M&amp;As as merchant banks get busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of twiddling their thumbs, merchant bankers are finding
business picking up. Some are even beginning to recruit to their corporate
finance departments.
It is the clearest sign yet that the banks believe the revival in corporate
finance work sustainable. Those financiers not enjoying their summer
holidays claim they are working overtime on deals which will become public
in the autumn.
'I'm normally a cautious chap,' says one, 'but I'm really quite surprised
about the level of activity in the last three months. We are very busy at
the moment, and not with tiddly floats. Since March or April activity has
picked up strongly and the quality is good.'
Others refer to the three Rs of corporate finance: restructurings, rights
issues and rescues. The year has already seen a high level of flotations and
rights issues; restructurings, such as the reorganisation of the Rothmans
empire and the demerger of Zeneca from Imperial Chemical Industries; and
continued rescue work.
UK privatisations may be falling off after the BT3 sale last month, but
there is much to be done for foreign governments - French and Italian for
instance - and UK banks have an edge because of the experience of the past
10 years. Hill Samuel was this week appointed to seek private sector finance
for the Channel Tunnel rail link, while NM Rothschild is privatising the
Dutch post office.
The Lloyd's insurance market's decision to seek corporate capital has also
produced work for corporate financiers.
But the pick-up in activity does not presage a return of the large hostile
bid, or even a high level of mergers and acquisitions. 'In the UK there is
quite a lot of activity, but it's not direct M&amp;A,' says a Rothschild
director. 'In the late 1980s half the department would call themselves M&amp;A
specialists, but not now. There is a different character to the work. Now
there is little takeover activity and none of it hostile.'
'Going into the market and buying things is yesterday's game,' says Mr Nick
Verey, SG Warburg's managing director of investment banking. 'The old type
of mergers and acquisitions is over.' A rival agrees: 'Those are a thing of
the past,' while another says: 'There has been a sea change - I'd be
surprised if it recovers.'
Companies have learnt that hostile bids rarely pay off for the aggressor,
which ends up paying a top price without being able to perform 'due
diligence' investigations.
With the Footsie index reaching all-time highs in the past few days, the
stock market had anticipated the economic recovery before companies were
ready to expand again. 'When you run the slide rule over a company, with the
stock market where it is, it doesn't look attractive to pay a premium,' one
says.
However, there is a marked increase in industrially driven deals, usually
agreed. These often result from companies restructuring their businesses,
having survived the recession. Many wish to sell non-core activities and can
see a better market for assets than even a few months ago, while others want
to expand.
Lucas Industries' Pounds 9m disposal this week is part of its programme to
raise Pounds 100m from sales this year. Other deals also illustrate the
point: the sale of the Augustus Barnett off-licence chain by Bass to
Allied-Lyons and the purchase by Greene King of 44 pubs from Bass.
As for full-scale takeovers, the agreed bid by Greenalls for Devenish, which
fought off a hostile bid from Boddington two years ago, shows that
commercial logic can bring about a deal that hostility did not.
Some bankers claim such deals are 'small beer', compared with some they are
pursuing. Agreed deals are seen as low risk, as due diligence can be carried
out and nasty surprises avoided. A price can be fixed without the bidder
finding itself caught in a public auction.
These deals are often cross-border, as companies find themselves restricted
within their domestic markets and keen to become international forces in
their industries. The agreed merger between Kingfisher, the UK retail group,
and Darty, the French electrical chain, earlier this year is a case in
point.
Many banks, such as Lazard Brothers and NM Rothschild, have built up
European office networks and forged closer links with partners in North
America or Asia.
Similarly, says Mr David Challen, head of corporate finance at Schroders,
European cross-border mergers and acquisitions now account for half of that
investment bank's public activities - a very different picture from five
years ago.
Two thirds of Warburg's corporate finance work is now generated overseas -
privatisations and secondary shares issues on continental Europe and equity
and debt issues in the US.
If the economy continues to revive, some expect M&amp;A activity to increase
next year. With interest rates low and the equity market high, finance for
deals should be forthcoming.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Lloyd's Names vote in support of business strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON members have strongly rejected moves to make new investors
help bale out badly hit Names, boosting the confidence of the insurance
market's management team as it seeks to attract fresh capital.
Lloyd's announced yesterday that Names - the individuals whose assets
support the market - had voted in a postal ballot by a margin of more than
two to one to reject two motions opposed to plans put forward by the
market's management.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said the result was 'a mandate to implement its
business plan and return Lloyd's to profit'.
The business plan, approved by the council, or governing body, in April,
proposes sharp cost cutting and streamlining of business procedures to make
the market more attractive to corporate investors.
A vote in favour of two motions presented by loss-making Names would have
severely damaged investor confidence in the market which has suffered losses
of more than Pounds 5.5bn over the past five years. The market faces
mounting litigation between loss-making Names and the agents who manage
their interests.
The rebel Names who had called for the ballot drew attention to the low
response - only 18,137 Names voted, although 32,023 were eligible to do so.
They said more Names had voted in favour of the critical motions than in a
postal ballot last year.
'There are still a third of Lloyd's Names who are dissatisfied with the way
things are being done,' said Mr Claud Gurney, the Name who called for last
month's extraordinary general meeting which preceded the ballot.
A total of 5,673 Names voted in favour and 12,104 Names against a motion
calling on Lloyd's to accept that it owes a fiduciary duty of care to
members.
A resolution calling on Lloyd's to press new corporate investors to 'fully
compensate' existing Names for a stake in the goodwill and assets of the
Corporation of Lloyd's attracted 5,486 votes in favour and 12,252 against.
Finally 13,623 names voted in favour and 4,179 Names against a third motion
backing the council, its business plan and its moves to introduce corporate
capital.
The Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Names,
welcomed the vote. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the ALM, said: 'We hope this
marks an end to trial by extraordinary general meeting and an honest
commitment to support for a realistic business plan.'
Mr Richard Astor, a Name associated with past EGM initiatives, lamented the
result: 'They deserve everything they get if this is the way they react.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / Drugs groups express relief at pricing plans: Proposed
agreement leaves regulated profits intact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government yesterday surprised the drugs industry by proposing a
conciliatory new five-year pricing agreement for pharmaceuticals which does
not involve a feared cut in companies' regulated profits.
The voluntary scheme, which must be agreed by the industry, includes a 2.5
per cent cut in prices for three years.
Most drugs groups greeted the proposals with relief. There had been fears of
a far larger reduction in prices - up to 7 per cent - following similar cuts
in Germany and Italy. The maximum return on capital employed - presently
controlled at between 17 per cent and 21 per cent after allowing for
research and development expenditure - was also expected to have been cut.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said: 'This has been a lengthy
negotiation, with hard bargaining on both sides. I believe the agreement is
in the best interests of patients, the taxpayer and the industry itself. I
hope the pharmaceutical companies will support it.'
Glaxo, the UK's biggest pharmaceuticals company, said it found the new
scheme acceptable given the current economic difficulties in the UK.
However, it warned that in the long term the British industry had to be
supported to ensure continuing funding of research into new diseases. Swiss
and American companies, which have been more critical than their British
counterparts about the government's attitude, have yet to respond.
Drug groups have two weeks in which to study the complicated deal, known as
the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. If they agree its terms, the
price reduction would take effect on October 1. The cuts would save the
Department of Health about Pounds 85m.
Last year the National Health Service drugs budget was about Pounds 3.4bn,
but was increasing at about 14 per cent. Mrs Bottomley said it was difficult
to ask NHS employees to accept a 1.5 per cent ceiling on pay rises while the
drugs bill grew at that rate.
The new scheme involves a number of complex elements. These include:
A reduction in the 'grey area' which allows companies to exceed their
maximum return on capital by 50 per cent if they have achieved higher sales
without excessive promotion or price increases. The 'grey area' would be cut
to 25 per cent.
Only allowing companies to ask for an increase in prices if they undershoot
their return on capital target by 25 per cent.
Exempting small companies with NHS drugs sales of under Pounds 20m from
providing full financial details to the Department of Health to enable it to
calculate their return on capital. The previous limit was Pounds 4m. This
will affect about 25 companies.
UK healthcare stocks were largely indifferent to the news. The UK is one of
the smaller European pharmaceutical markets and few companies are heavily
exposed to it. In a falling market Glaxo closed up 7 1/2 p at 524p,
SmithKline Beecham fell 7p at 431p, Wellcome rose 5p at 659p and Zeneca was
steady at 650p.

FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: BOC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fear that the equity market might be rattled by company profits lagging
behind talk of recovery may be coming true. BOC has particular problems in
its healthcare business now that its staple anaesthetic Forane has come off
patent, and its loss of market share is responsible for the bulk of this
year's likely profits fall. However, it now seems that BOC's medical
equipment business is also feeling the chill of cuts in healthcare spending
ahead of Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton's reforms.
While it is hardly startling that medical businesses are under pressure, the
company's downbeat comments about industrial gases are more worrying.
Profits are flat despite sales increases in local currency terms, implying a
fall in margins. In part that may be because some long-term contracts with
large users are up for renegotiation at lower prices. These take-or-pay
contracts with industrial users - such as chemical and steel companies -
also mean that BOC is not heavily geared to an upturn in gas usage. At the
other end of the scale there is little sign of increased activity by the
construction or engineering businesses which are users of compressed
cylinder gas. If anything they are still economising by using fewer
cylinders to save on rental charges.
Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that the pattern is similar throughout
BOC's main markets. UK construction and engineering shares have been driven
up to very fancy ratings in the sure and certain expectation of recovery. A
little disappointment seems in order.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of pricing negotiations with the UK government should not by
itself add to the great de-rating of the pharmaceuticals sector. The UK
accounts for only a small proportion of sales for most overseas drugs
companies. Even Glaxo, most exposed of the domestic industry, might view the
2.5 per cent annual price cut demanded by government as a moderate result.
The return on capital of 17 to 21 per cent - after allowing for research and
development expenditure - under the UK formula is better than that achieved
in most other industries. Real returns will look all the more handsome if
inflation remains subdued. The question for the stock market, though, is
whether the rate of return is an adequate compensation for the degree of
risk.
Although the slide in pharmaceutical shares has so far reflected doubts
about the returns which can be earned by drugs companies, investment in
pharmaceuticals is also becoming more risky. Big buyers of healthcare are no
longer prepared to pay high prices for drugs which offer only marginal
improvements over cheaper alternatives. The UK government's own blacklist of
products is a case in point. Sales growth in future is likely to come only
from drugs which are a genuine breakthrough in their field. Whether stock
market investors will be prepared to nurse fewer blockbusting compounds
through research and development at lower overall rates of return is a open
question.

FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since General Accident started to increase UK premium rates ahead of other
composite insurers, it has consistently been furthest down the road towards
underwriting profitability. Its solvency ratio of 47 per cent is now
comfortable, but the company can still not afford to sacrifice underwriting
profits in pursuit of market share. If that makes GA a leading indicator of
UK insurers' resolve to make a decent return on underwriting, yesterday's
interim figures contain a warning for the sector.
Modest second-quarter underwriting profits are encouraging from personal
motor and home insurance business and - were it not for the IRA bombing
campaign in the City - from commercial property. Higher premiums and tighter
underwriting standards are having the desired effect. But GA can see no room
for additional rate rises in its more profitable lines of business. That
leaves scope for perhaps another year of rising underwriting profits as the
most recent price increases work through. By this time next year, though,
competition may already be eroding those gains.
With its business in the US, Canada and Europe still losing money at an
underwriting level, there is scope for recovery elsewhere. Like other
insurers GA also points to its investment return in addition to the
underwriting result to give a measure of total performance. The recent rally
in the sector has certainly been driven by expectations of investment gains
from rising stock and bond markets. But insurance companies cannot expect to
trade at much of a premium to net assets unless they add value to those
assets by consistently making profits from insurance.

FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Deflated expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's contention that inflationary pressures remain weak is
hardly controversial. Published data show that since sterling left the ERM
any increases in prices of imported goods have been more than offset by
falls in wage costs. With the labour market weak, sterling stable, a large
gap in output below the economy's productive potential, and companies
reluctant to try to push up margins, the Bank argues that there is no engine
to power renewed inflation.
While that is clearly true in the medium term, it may not be so once the
output gap has been closed and the labour market has recovered its poise.
Decades of inflationary behaviour may not be so quickly unlearned. All the
more so since the fiscal deficit remains troublingly high, and, as the Bank
points out, such difficulties have in the past been resolved by eroding the
value of the public debt. Small wonder then that the gilts market remains
sceptical that there has been a sea change in the UK's inflation
performance. Low real yields will have to wait for harder evidence of
government commitment to deficit reduction.
Nor do lower short-term rates look imminent. The government's inflation
targets look attainable for the next couple of years, but the trend is
stable, rather than down. Unless there is a substantial fiscal tightening in
the Budget, or the recovery falters, there is little hurry to act. That can
hardly encourage an equity market which has whipped itself into a lather
over immediate base rate cuts.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Exports forecast to spark revival in German economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPORT-LED revival of the German economy next year was forecast yesterday
by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the country's economics minister, in spite of the
strength of the D-Mark in the European monetary system.
Most economic indicators suggested the sharpest downturn in the German
economy since the second world war had bottomed out and a gradual recovery
was likely for the rest of the year, Mr Rexrodt said.
He forecast growth of 1.5 per cent for west German gross domestic product in
1994, compared with a decline of the same amount this year.
He warned that unemployment was likely to keep rising in Germany to 4m by
the end of the year, with a further increase in 1994. Job creation schemes
in east and west Germany came in for particular criticism as a positive
incentive for employers to scrap genuine jobs.
While expressing some concern about the revaluation of the German currency
against other European Community currencies over the past year, he insisted
that the problem should not be 'over-dramatised'.
He calculated the effect of the currency turmoil in Europe of the past year
as an effective revaluation of the D-Mark by 8 per cent against other EC
currencies, and 11 per cent against all EC currencies and member states of
the European Free Trade Association put together.
At the same time, the revaluation meant cheaper imports, and the D-Mark had
moved in the opposite direction against both the dollar and the yen  - by 13
per cent and 25 per cent respectively.
Mr Rexrodt said the recent upwards movement of the D-Mark in the currency
markets was largely based on speculative money movements, and he discounted
big changes in European exchange rate differentials over the longer term.
His cautiously optimistic view was presented in a traditional summer
assessment of German economic prospects by the Economics Ministry. He
forecast an inflation rate, currently running at an annual 4.3 per cent in
west Germany, decreasing to 4 per cent by the end of the year, and
continuing to decline in 1994 - in spite of a sharp increase in oil taxation
next year.
'The downward path of the economy has come to a halt,' he said, citing both
reviving business confidence and the recovery of demand for German exports.
He admitted that domestic industrial demand, particularly for investment
goods, was still depressed.
Mr Rexrodt predicted a much sharper recovery of 5 per cent in east Germany
in the current year, accelerating to 6.5 per cent in 1994, but not a
genuinely self-sustaining growth rate.
Construction, the communications industry and vehicle manufacturing were all
eastern growth sectors, although the manufacturing industry was still in
severe difficulty.

FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers cut into share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKERS finally moved into the UK stock market yesterday, taking their
cue from the failure of the stock index sector to hold new highs and a
reminder from BOC, the industrial chemicals group, of the pressures on
corporate profits. Selling pressure increased in the second half of the
session when early trading on Wall Street saw the Dow Industrial Average
slipping away from the peak levels of the previous session.
Some surprise was expressed that UK equities should weaken when the bond
market was still very firm. Some traders suggested that a rights issue might
be in the offing. But the general view was that profit-taking was hardly
unexpected after the strong advance in the stock market over the past month.
The two week equity account, which has brought substantial paper profits for
investors, closes on Friday and there is every inclination to cash in early.
The FT-SE Index closed down 14.8 at 2,971.6
Shares opened higher, on the back of Wall Street's overnight peak, and edged
forward in early trading. However, equities went into reverse when the
September future on the Footsie started the day with a sharp sell-off. At
mid-morning, the scene brightened when the futures contract pushed to a new
peak of 3,006 but it was soon clear that buyers would not support this
level.
Dealers said that it was underlying weakness in equities that pulled the
future down, rather than the other way round, as is more often the case. The
BOC trading statement for the third quarter, read by analysts as an
effective profits warning, hit hard at the market's new-found optimism, and
also emphasised the question markets still overhanging the currently
generous valuations on which UK shares are trading.
However, nothing seemed able to halt the upward pace of the FT-SE MId 250
Index which yesterday added another 7.4 to break through to a new peak of
3,406.8.
Demand for second line stocks also showed itself in the pattern of turnover.
Around 61 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 771.9m shares was in
non-Footsie shares. On Monday, 525.3m shares through the Seaq network were
worth Pounds 1.19bn in retail business, slightly below recent averages but
still comfortably profitable for the market professionals.
The Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, which appeared relatively cautious
on hopes for an early base rate cut, was not released until after stock
market hours. This morning will bring the first reaction to the bank's
report from retail and consumer issues, which were steady yesterday as
optimism on interest rates was buoyed by Monday's consumer lending data.
International stocks drew little benefit from Wall Street's strength, oil
shares mostly giving ground on uncertainty towards crude oil prices.
Reuters, the global financial data group, came in for severe profit-taking
after talks between the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange (LIFFE) and Reuters' Globex subsidiary were suspended. The
pharmaceutical sector held up well in the face of cuts in drug prices.
The financial share sectors remained dull as attention switched from the UK
banks to the insurance companies which are now reporting on recent trading.

SUBDUED trading again dominated the day's events in the futures market,
although the volume in traded options returned to more lively levels, writes
Christopher Price.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened brightly above the
3,000-level before a medium-sized seller appeared and the lack of buying
interest immediately sent the future into reverse. Subdued investor interest
appeared soon afterwards and September began a slow climb back, although
trading activity continued poor.
But with a firm gilts market and further talk of Europe-wide interest rate
cuts, September persevered and reached a new intra-day high of 3,006 in late
morning trading.
From there, however, it started a slow decline as sellers appeared with
hints in some dealing quarters that the market is looking overbought and
could be due for a correction.
September closed at 2,983, a nine-point premium to its fair value of around
3. Turnover was a lowly 5,348 contracts.
Traded options returned to more active levels, with nearly 29,000 contracts
traded, which was 10,000 better than Monday's total. The FT-SE option traded
5,648 contracts.
Hanson was easily the top traded stock option, reaching 4,657 contracts by
the end of the session. Glaxo recorded 2,011 and P&amp;O 1,750.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Interim profits from General Accident, the composite insurer, were at the
very top end of market expectations but failed to induce any substantial
buying interest in a market where optimists had been looking for an increase
in the interim dividend.
The latter was held at 9.7p, with some analysts pointing out that GenAx has
been criticised in the past for paying out too much in dividends.
Dealers said the 9 fall in the share price to 683p represented no more than
small-scale selling by disappointed speculators. Turnover was an
unremarkable 2.4m shares.
Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley, the US investment
bank, described GenAX's figures as 'very encouraging', and said a rights
issue is less likely with solvency margins at 49 per cent. The broker
shifted its stance from 'sell' to 'hold'.
Enterprise Oil was a big casualty in an otherwise sedate oil and gas sector
as the market reacted badly to news that Mr John Walmsley, the group's
highly-rated finance director, is to leave the group at the end of the year.
Enterprise fell 12 to 439p on the news with turnover expanding rapidly to a
higher than normal 1.1m shares.
'The market has taken this news very badly and is scenting that perhaps
something could be going wrong at Enterprise,' said one analyst, who added
that Mr Walmsley has been at Enterprise since the group was floated on the
market in the early 1980's.
International news and information organisation Reuters fell 24 to 1524p on
news that the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(LIFFE) had suspended discussions on joining the company's Globex system,
the after-hours electronic trading system owned with the Chicago Board of
Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Turnover was 1.1m shares.
Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite said it was no more than a
technical reaction to a small piece of bad news.
Another analyst said the announcement had triggered profit-taking after the
recent strong run in the shares.
Bank shares, among the market's best performers since the UK withdrew from
the ERM last September, suffered from a bout of profit-taking, largely
triggered by 'take profits' advice from one of the leading London broking
houses.
Standard Chartered, reporting interims tomorrow and whose shares have been
hitting new peaks in recent sessions, tumbled 14 to 882p as talk of a hefty
cash call along with the figures began to filter into the market. Any rights
issue, however, is expected to be well taken and nearer to Pounds 250m than
Pounds 500m.
Lloyds Bank was the biggest casualty in the high street banks, the shares
dipping 12 to 534p on 4.8m traded, with dealers noting plenty of switching
out of Lloyds and into Barclays and NatWest. The latter settled 6 off at
497p and the former 4 off at 498p.
Merchant banks, on the other hand, continued to make good progress, with
Kleinwort Benson 6 up at 498p and SG Warburg 4 better at 797p.
Commercial Union retreated 11 to 649p, affected by General Accident. Royals
were active and eased 4 to 343p.
News International moved 11 ahead to 255p on the back of its recent
successful bid for a controlling stake in StarTV, the Hong Kong-based
satellite system.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, appreciated 5 to 479p and Reed
International, the international publishing group, climbed 10 to 663p. Both
companies had underperformed the market over the past period.
In the media sector, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi shed 4 to 168p, although its interim
results were in line with market expectations.
SG Warburg downgraded the group's final pre-tax profits forecast from Pounds
27m to Pounds 24m on high redundancy costs in Europe.
The announcement that Owners Abroad was appointing Mr Michael Julien as
chairman saw the shares rally, closing 10 ahead at 77p. Turnover was a
healthy 6.7m. Dealers said the appointment reassured some investors who
considered the stock as undervalued, but remained nervous after the recent
profits warning.
Anglo-Dutch food group Unilever weakened on further press comment on the
brands issue and nervousness ahead of its results on Friday. The shares
dropped 11 to 951p.
The prospect of further domestic interest rate reductions drove the
housebuilders sharply higher.
Wilson Bowden was the market's favourite, closing 12 up at 431p, closely
followed by Persimmon, 6 higher at 275p and Berkeley, 4 firmer at 419p.
Turnover in British Land rose to 3m as a block of 1m was placed at 356p. The
shares were unchanged at 358p. In a strong property sector, Slough Estates
gained 5 to 230p.

FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BA wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First quarter results from British Airways (BA) saw the shares accelerate as
transport analysts, picking through the wealth of statistics issued by the
company, declared themselves highly positive.
Most focused on the passenger yield - the key industry measure of average
fare income per kilometre travelled - which rose by 2.3 per cent to 6.17p.
The figure benefited from favourable currency movements.
Despite a fall in pre-tax profits, analysts were excited by the potential
for a pick-up in trading in 1994. 'Against a background of low inflation and
economic recovery, the operational gearing and low prospective multiple
makes BA one of the most attractive cyclical plays in the market,' said Mr
Mark Laurence at Smith New Court, who yesterday turned buyer of the stock.
Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss Turnbull said: 'These figures show BA's
ability to make reasonable money in the most appalling market conditions. If
the trading and competitive environments improve then it is capable of being
very profitable indeed.' He added that for the long-term, the stock was
'substantially undervalued'.
Analysts' full-year profit forecasts varied widely. Smith New Court cut its
current year forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 225m, with a smaller cut to
Pounds 375m for 1994-95. Strauss is looking for Pounds 345m and Pounds 450m
respectively.
Spurred on by good US support, the shares ended the day 14 1/2 up at 350p in
hefty turnover of 15m.

FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BOC hit on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET'S enthusiasm for BOC shares, which has taken the price up from a
mid-July level of 640p to 703p, evaporated yesterday as the company
accompanied its third quarter results with a warning that full-year results
will not match those of last year.
The profits warning, which came at the end of the official company results
bulletin, was a bolt from the blue for the market. Dealers at first queried
the profits warning news and then proceeded to demolish the BOC share price.
The stock price opened tentatively at 686p but quickly retreated to what
proved to be the day's low of 651p, a net fall of 63p. Turnover in BOC
accelerated to 9.9m shares, the heaviest single day's business since 1986.
Analysts were shocked by the profits warning. One said: 'The figures were
around the bottom range of estimates but were okay. But the real worry
around the market was that the company offered no real reason for the
warning at the post-figures meeting. And you have to remember that most of
the big broking firms have been bulls of the shares in recent months. To say
the least, there is a lot of investor dissatisfaction around the market.'
Dealers said there was every chance the shares would come under further
pressure this morning.
Profits forecast for the current year, previously in the region of Pounds
365m, have now been reduced to just below the Pounds 341m the company
achieved last year.

FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking brings Dow back
from high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES edged off their record highs yesterday in spite of fresh
declines in long-term interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.35 at 3,572.73.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.25 lower at 449.46,
while the Amex composite finished up 0.39 at 439.19, and the Nasdaq
composite down 1.41 at 717.08. NYSE volume was 255m shares. After Monday's
record-breaking run, some investors chose to take profits. The early fall in
prices, however, also reflected a still uncertain mood.
Monday's advance was powered primarily by falling interest rates, and
although rates continued to drop yesterday - the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond dropped to 6.45 per cent, the lowest point in the bond's
history - stocks did not respond. Instead, selling pressure pulled prices
lower across the board.
Each time stocks have posted new record highs this year, they have fallen
back almost immediately. This suggests that investors remain nervous about
the fact that prices keep reaching new heights in spite of relatively poor
economic fundamentals.
Among individual stocks, Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46
1/4 in volume of 1.7m shares after the big consumer products manufacturer
announced a fourth quarter loss of Dollars 1.83 a share, compared with a
profit of 46 cents a share a year ago. The loss followed a Dollars 1.5bn
charge for the cost of plant consolidations and other organisational
restructuring.
Some big retailing stocks fell on disappointing earnings. Among them were
Wal-Mart, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 25 in heavy trading, Dillard
Department Stores, down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 35, and The Limited,
Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 21.
Eastman Kodak continued to rally as investors looked forward to an
improvement in the company's earnings following the departure last week of
its chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore. The stock added another Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 60 5/8 in volume of 3.5m shares. Tandy fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
28 7/8 after the computer company announced a sharp drop in quarterly
operating earnings.
On the Nasdaq market, Scitex dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 on
second quarter earnings of 52 cents a share, down from 75 cents a share a
year earlier.
Other stocks received a boost from strong second quarter results, including
Huntco, up Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 1/4 , Teva Pharmaceutical, up Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 25 7/8 , and Merisel, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 11 3/4 .
Profit-taking took the edge off leading technology stocks, with Apple down
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 28 1/2 , Microsoft, Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 71,
and Sun Microsystems Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 27 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed higher in busy trading, led by a surge among
mining stocks.
According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index rose 26.24 points, or
0.66 per cent, to close at 4,028.44. Advancing issues outnumbered declines
412 to 306. Volume was 63.038m shares, up from Monday's 42.776m, and value
rose to CDollars 709.2m from CDollars 510.3m.
Ten of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the mining group, up 2.8 per
cent. Alcan Aluminium climbed 1 to CDollars 27 5/8 .

FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: (Asia Pacific): Obon holiday season
takes its toll of Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE activity dominated trading, with most investors absent for the
Obon holiday period, and share prices closed almost unchanged, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose by just 0.70 to 20,493.75. Initial optimism about
economic stimuli from the new government produced a day's high of 20,655.27,
but a fall in the futures market depressed the index to a day's low of
20,476.35 in late afternoon.
Volume rose to 280m shares from 187m. Advances led declines by 524 to 415
with 215 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks ended 2.21
higher at 1,661.22 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.66 to
1,267.45.
Afternoon trading concentrated on a press conference given by Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the new prime minister. Futures traders were discouraged by Mr
Hosokawa's cautious stance on income tax cuts and the issue of government
bonds to cover a budget deficit.
However, specific sectors were bought on Monday's comments by individual
ministers after their inauguration. Mr Kozo Igarashi, the construction
minister, hoped for housing tax cuts, while Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the minister
for industry and trade, indicated support for 'new' infrastructure projects
centred around telecommunications.
Housing and real estate companies gained ground. SxL, a home builder, rose
Y50 to Y1,470, Sekisui House gained Y20 to Y1,310 and Mitsui Fudosan rose
Y20 to Y1,330.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y19,000 to Y946,000 in active trading.
KDD advanced Y300 to Y12,800 ahead of the listing of DDI, a new telecoms
company.
Nikko Securities rose Y30 to Y1,220 on the restructuring theme, although
other brokers remained mixed. City banks were lower on profit-taking, with
Industrial Bank of Japan down Y10 to Y3,390 and Bank of Tokyo falling Y20 to
Y1,760.
Warehousing groups were higher on hopes that the new government's efforts to
spur domestic demand would support profits. Mitsubishi Warehouse and
Transportation rose Y10 to Y1,670 and Mitsui Soko advanced Y15 to Y924. In
Osaka, the OSE average closed up 104.16 at 22,456.22 in volume of 14m
shares. Murata Mfg rose Y30 to Y3,180 on buying by foreign investors.
Roundup
SOME strong performances were seen in the Pacific Rim region.
SINGAPORE climbed after its holiday as the government announced that the
economy had grown at an unexpectedly strong 10.1 per cent in the second
quarter.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 27.59 to 1,898.84, but profit-taking
left it unable to maintain a record intra-day high of 1,912.14.
AUSTRALIA advanced as the shine returned to golds and the All Ordinaries
index closed up 16.1 at 1,860.4.
The gold marker gained 99.2, or 4.6 per cent, to 2,247.8. North Flinders
Mines was 90 cents higher at ADollars 13.60.
SEOUL saw a technical rebound in response to three consecutive days of
losses, aided by a buying spree in construction issues on hopes that the
government would decide today to boost infrastructure investment. The
composite index rose 9.85 to 719.44.
MANILA was driven higher by heavy buying of PLDT and the newly-listed JG
Summit which spilled over into other stocks, and the composite index rose
18.40 to 1,734.19.
A Dollars 1 overnight rise in PLDT to Dollars 41 on Wall Street fuelled
local buying and the price rose by 10 pesos to 1,095 pesos. Summit closed at
6.40 pesos, up from the previous 6 pesos.
HONG KONG's property sector was hit by rumours that Hang Seng Bank might be
about to tighten mortgage lending and the Hang Seng index, down almost 100
points at one stage, finished 52.41 lower at 7,329.81.
Cheung Kong shed 40 cents to HKDollars 27.60, Hongkong Land lost 30 cents to
HKDollars 16.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 50 cents to HKDollars
38.25.
JAKARTA felt the benefit of more good half-year corporate results and the
official index rose 5.30 to 369.83.

FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ferruzzi plans weigh upon
Italian banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses remained active, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN turned its attention back to Ferruzzi. The troubled group posted
losses for the first five months of the year which were more than double
earlier estimates as the Comit index eased 1.54 to 588.77.
Ferruzzi and Montedison were suspended ahead of a meeting of the Ferruzzi
board, which said it was cutting its issued share capital to L205bn from
L1,370bn and slashing the nominal value of its shares to L5 from L1,000. The
Montedison board meets today.
The group's creditor banks were marked lower. Mediobanca, which leads the
group of seven banks preparing a rescue plan, lost L505 or 3 per cent to
16,319. Credito Italiano shed L90 to L2,645, BCI fell L227 to L5,150 and San
Paolo declined L243 to L8,817.
Fiat rose L99 to L7,009 in volume which picked up to almost 12.5m shares, as
long-standing rumours resurfaced of an international sale or alliance.
Among telecommunications issues, Italcable continued its climb, adding L423
to L9,569 in volume of 11.8m shares in response to the planned merger with
Sip.
FRANKFURT saw a sharp about-turn in financials, but there were some useful
gains elsewhere as the DAX index eased 7.14 to 1,865.16. Turnover rose from
DM7.5bn to DM8.9bn.
Bundesbank repo market action was seen as an attempt to stabilise money
market rates after their recent sharp declines. Allianz fell DM35 to
DM2,384, Commerzbank by DM7.70 to DM322 and Deutsche Bank by DM8.90 to
DM773; Dresdner, which produced better than expected half-year results, fell
by DM9 to DM410.50.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that, while buyers were
more cautious, the DAX had three tries at breaking through the 1,880 level
yesterday, balking at an intra-day high of 1,879.49.
Good news included encouraging sales for Daimler's new Mercedes C range, but
although the stock led the most actives list, it closed just DM1.50 higher
at DM686. Auto-related stocks like MAN, DM14 better at DM326, and Varta,
DM12.50 higher at DM320, produced the big gains in the sector, while
Volkswagen fell again, by DM3.70 to DM367.50.
PARIS was more resilient than its German neighbour although here, too, there
was a suggestion that buyers were waiting for lower prices. In the end, some
dealers felt that they could not wait and the CAC-40 index fashioned an
afternoon recovery to close 1.26 higher at 2,139.78 after falling by nearly
15 points during the session.
Turnover rose from FFr3.17bn to FFr3.44bn. Foreign interest remained, and
Michelin seemed to benefit from an outperform rating from Lehman Brothers in
New York as it rose another FFr2.10 to FFr193.50.
As in Frankfurt, motor industry sentiment was mixed. Peugeot closed
unchanged at FFr687 before after-hours news of an 11.6 per cent drop in
first half sales. Elsewhere, Lafarge-Coppee fell FFr5.60 to FFr450.40 on
profit-taking.
ZURICH was dragged lower by futures related hedging, and renewed
profit-taking in banks ahead of half-year figures which begin with UBS
tomorrow. The SMI index fell 36.0 or 1.5 per cent to 2,384.5.
Some Swiss brokers have forecast profits growth from the banks of 40-50 per
cent but London analysts are more cautious. They are looking for rises in
the 20 to 30 per cent range which, while healthy, would still prove a
disappointment to some investors.
UBS fell SFr29 to SFr1,181 and SBC was SFr13 lower at SFr458.
AMSTERDAM continued its advance, the CBS Tendency index rising 0.7 to 124.60
amid widespread short-covering by professionals who had shorted cyclical
stocks in the false expectation that they were about to fall from recent
highs.
Fokker, the aerospace group, added 50 cents at Fl 20.90 before announcing a
first-half net loss after hours. Philips finished Fl 1 higher at a year'
high of Fl 36.50, and its PolyGram affiliate rose Fl 1.90 to a 12-month high
of Fl 61.40 after its better than expected half year figures and acquisition
of Motown.
MADRID's volume stayed thin, although it rose from Pta10.5bn to Pta12.6bn as
the general index closed 0.71 higher at 271.63. Banesto rose Pta70 to
Pta2,330 as it completed the second stage of a massive, three-tier funding
operation.
BRUSSELS saw more volatility in steels, Arbed erasing Monday's advance with
a BFr260, or 6.1 per cent, fall to BFr4,015. The Bel-20 index eased 6.28 to
1,336.86.
STOCKHOLM took profits after its recent rally and the Affarsvarlden index
dipped 10.9 to 1247.1. SKF B shares slipped SKr4 to SKr112; the company is
expected to lead a string of earnings reports with a sharply higher loss
today.
New highs came in DUBLIN and VIENNA, the former more spectacular as the ISEQ
overall index closed 26.35, or 1.5 per cent higher at 1,745.39 with a 2.0
per cent gain in financials in further appreciation of Monday's AIB results.
Austria's ATX index closed 4.67 higher at 1,009.70.

FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Chile's traders adjust to less
exhilarating events - The equity slowdown in Santiago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heady days of 1991, when the Santiago stock exchange leapt by 124 per
cent in dollar terms, are long past.
Chile's traders are adjusting to less exhilarating rates of return as the
export-dominated economy, which expanded by 10.2 per cent last year, adapts
to more difficult worldwide trading conditions.
However, excitement is not totally absent. In June, after a sluggish three
months dominated by worries over the falling price of copper, cellulose and
fish meal, the IPSA index of the 40 most heavily traded shares rebounded by
around 10 per cent in dollar terms.
The rally, according to Mr James Walker, head of research at Celfin
Consultants, was prompted by the recovery in the copper price, the country's
main export, as well as signs that the domestic economy, which had been in
danger of overheating, was beginning to cool. Mr Walker expects GDP to grow
by a relatively modest 6 per cent this year.
In July the equity market had mixed and ultimately marginal fortunes, with
the IPSA 40 gaining nearly 1 per cent to close the month at 114.62. The
month was dominated by uncertainty over forthcoming first-half results, and
a lack of liquidity in financial markets which pushed up short-term interest
rates.
In the event, most company results were significantly down on the same
period last year, but many fared better than in the first quarter of 1993.
CTC, the telecommunications group, and Chile's biggest quoted company with
an equity market capitalisation of around Dollars 3bn, bucked the downward
trend by registering a strong growth in profits, as did Soquimich, the
mining company, which saw profits rise 86 per cent to Dollars 13.2m after
last year's restructuring. The beverage industry also did well as it
responded to growing local demand.
A return to liquidity in the system in August and a feeling that results had
not been as bad as expected contributed to a 4 per cent rise in the first
week of trading. The IPSA index at one stage touched 118.84, its highest
level of the year, closing on Monday at 118.51. Cervezas, the brewing group,
and Entel the telephone company, were among the highest risers.
Most analysts remain optimistic about the prospects of the big four
electricity groups in spite of heavily-dented first-half profits. The
country's electricity generators and suppliers, among the largest companies
on the Santiago bolsa with equity capitalisations of up to Dollars 2 1/2 bn,
have big stakes in Argentina's newly privatised electricity industry.
Analysts expect these investments to begin to show profits from early next
year.
The banking sector looks more uncertain. A bill aimed at resolving the
subordinated debt issue, which has dogged banks since the central bank took
over their bad debts in the early 1980s, is expected to go before congress
this month. Some banks have expressed unease over government proposals, but
most analysts, including researchers at Salomon Brothers, feel that the
banks should benefit from a resolution of the issue.
The same uncertainty has been felt over capital markets reform, which aims
to broaden the investment options of institutions, particularly the powerful
pension funds or AFPs. Mr Karl Kluever, manager of Vestcorp Chile, the
stockbroker, says that institutions are adopting a 'wait and see attitude'.
Although much of the effects of the reform, which should come into effect
over the next few months, are already reflected in share prices, there is
expected to be some realignment of portfolios as the AFPs buy into
second-tier stocks. Institutions are currently restricted to blue-chip
companies.
Most traders believe that the Santiago bolsa, though less spectacular than
some other Latin American markets, notably Peru, is likely to remain a
fairly safe bet. Interest rates seem set to come down as inflationary
pressures ease, while big Chilean companies, like Soquimich, are still
queueing up to make ADR issues.
Researchers at First Boston believe that the two trends should combine to
produce 'good upside potential in the medium to long term'.
Mr Kluever predicts that the bolsa will yield a real return of around 14-16
per cent by the end of the year, an assessment which is more or less in line
with that of most other analysts.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French roller-coaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French futures had a frenetic day yesterday, initially heading downwards
before a dramatic late rally, writes Stephanie Flanders.
The September Pibor initially fell with the French currency, falling 17
basis points to reach a low of 92.93. There was clearly a sense that the
pressure on the franc would slow the pace of interest cuts.
Later, however, the mood changed dramatically, with September futures
reaching a contract high of 122.28.
The late gains were due to speculation about German interest rate cuts
following the D-mark's recent strength against all the major European
currencies. The shift was ironic, given that that the franc's morning fall
had been partly triggered by the Bundesbank's decision to set a fixed
unchanged fixed repo of 6.80 per cent at yesterday's tender, which was
thought to lessen the prospects of lower German rates.
The Bundesbank's decision was driven by a desire to regain control over
money market rates. Traders said that they still expected the German central
bank to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point at the first
post-recess council meeting on August 26.
'This is a technical adjustment - the Bundesbank was in a difficult
situation after the call money rate fell below the discount rate,' said Bank
Julius Baer economist Gerhard Grebe.
Sterling money markets were a good deal more tranquil on Tuesday compared to
the previous day, since there was neither important economic news nor
difficulties at the short end to stir the market. 'Unlike recent weeks, it
was really a pretty ordinary August day,' said one trader.
Most of a large Pounds 1.2bn shortage was removed early on in Bank of
England operations which a number of traders described as 'easy-going' on
both sides.
As a result, overnight rates fell as low as 4 3/4 per cent through
late-morning, before tightening a little in the afternoon to close at around
5 1/4 per cent. Overnights had risen slightly first thing, in a hangover
from the exceptional difficulties of the previous day.
Trading further out was similarly low-key. Yearly money closed up  1/16 at 5
5/8 per cent, while three month money closed unchanged. Sterling futures
were more lively, with the September contract catching up a little of the
ground which it has lost on December sterling in recent weeks. The September
contract gained 5 basis points to close at 94.21, while December sterling
was unchanged at 94.67.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark triumphs again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several European currencies were again humbled by the D-Mark yesterday as
the German currency continued its recent rise, writes Stephanie Flanders.
Almost all the European currencies lost ground against the D-Mark, but the
French franc and the Irish punt were in the spotlight, losing two and five
pfennigs respectively against the D-Mark in morning trading.
During the afternoon, however, the French currency recovered to close at
FFr3.521 compared to Monday's London close of FFr3.507. The Irish unit was
less fortunate and was still floundering at the close of trade.
The immediate trigger for the D-Mark's losses was the Bundesbank's morning
signal that it would not allow short-term German interest rates to fall
lower in the near future. But analysts said that traders were being driven
by the same reasoning as before.
'There's now an established tendency to lean on several of the ERM
currencies,' said Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank in London. 'The
market is getting the bit between its teeth: in the absence of a significant
loosening in countries like France and Belgium, the markets intend to
achieve the same thing through pushing down the currency instead.'
Several observers commented that trading volumes had picked up somewhat
during Monday and Tuesday, although few thought that there would be a
dramatic flight from a single currency. Steady pressure on almost all the
non-German ERM countries was more likely, they said.
In line with this view, the Danish Krone and Belgian franc also weakened
significantly, closing lower against the D-Mark. The Portuguese and Spanish
currencies fared better, but closed down on the day nevertheless.
Many were surprised to see the Irish currency come under such pressure,
given its recent high standing within the ERM grid. Yesterday's fall was
said to be partly a knock-on effect from sterling's weakness, as well as the
same market desire for a depreciation affecting the continental European
currencies.
'If anything, the Irish are the ones in the ERM with the best arguments for
a strong currency,' said one analyst. 'If the Irish Central Bank has not
been intervening to support the punt or making these arguments, it must be
because they've learned from the French experience that it's a hopeless
fight.'
Sterling and the dollar were both also frail yesterday, although on the
cross the US currency had the upper hand, closing at DM1.710.
The pound slid to DM2.5275 on the London exchanges. This was  3/4 of a
pfennig lower than the previous day's close. But dealers said it would soon
form a base and that yesterday's weakness was simply the result of the
strong D-Mark.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia's black city turns to
green sugar - John Madeley examines ideas for making cane harvesting
environmentally sound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUGAR industry around the Colombian city of Cali does not arouse many
sweet feelings among the local population. Thick black smoke belches from
the large sugar fields close to the city, creating a serious hazard for road
users, affecting people's lungs and producing an ash that rains from the sky
to blacken clothes.
In an area where the daytime temperature averages around 25`C throughout the
year, sugar-cane is continuously planted and harvested; before harvesting
the cane is burnt - so the smoke and the ash rarely stop.
Without damaging the crop, burning removes the leaves from sugarcane stalks
and makes them easier for cutters to harvest. Concerned that this 'sugar
by-product' is not contributing to a cleaner environment, the Colombian
sugarcane industry's research arm, Cenicana, is trying to help farmers to
clean-up the skies and harvest their cane 'green' rather than burnt.
Sugar-cane production in Colombia is concentrated on 135,000 hectares in the
flat lands of the country's Cauca Valley, near Cali. About a quarter of
annual output is exported, earning some Dollars 140m a year.
Costs of production are around 11 cents a lb, about 1.5 cents more than the
current world price. A buoyant national market takes most of the output and
accounts for the industry's profitability.
Switching over to green harvesting may be desirable, but 'it will need major
changes', says Cenicana's director, Mr James Cock.
The crop is cut by hand and if existing varieties of cane continue to be
used, the cutters would only harvest about 70 per cent of their current
output. As they are paid for every tonne they cut, their income would fall
by about 30 per cent.
The answer, Mr Cock believes, is to develop new varieties that can be
harvested 'green' as quickly as burnt cane. 'We have some very promising
lines which we call self-stripping, where the leaves fall off.'
It also helps if the new varieties are bred with thicker stems so that the
cutters get more weight per cut; if they axe the same number of stems a day,
they harvest a higher quantity of cane, so maintaining or increasing their
income. Again, it helps if varieties can be developed that are more erect as
this makes them easier to work with.
The new varieties will also overcome other problems facing the sugar
industry, believes Mr Cock. 'With the present varieties, we take a lot of
trash, such as leaves, to the sugar mill, which interferes with the factory
process,' he says. 'If we can grow varieties where the leaves just fall off
naturally before harvesting, we can overcome a lot of these problems.'
Cenicana is also trying to develop varieties that have a higher sugar
content. 'If we have a higher sugar content per tonne of cane harvested,
then we can accept slightly higher levels of trash,' says Mr Cock.
There are other agricultural advantages in harvesting green, he points out.
'If we harvest green, we get a mulch which covers the soil and helps to
conserve water and control weeds and may, in the long term, increase
fertility.'
A further benefit is that green harvesting leaves behind substantially more
residues, which can be used for industrial purposes. Sugar residues are
already used to make paper and could be adapted as an energy source,
possibly to generate electricity. 'Residues might also be used to fuel the
boilers in sugar mills, which would mean a saving of coal.'
Although cane for sugar is grown in monocropping fashion in Colombia, it
normally needs no pesticides. Biological control is the norm, with damaging
pests controlled by beneficial insects. Mr Cock wants to see this biological
control maintained but cautions that the change to green harvesting would
create uncertainties.
'We would have to harvest green cane for several years before we could be
sure that the biological control would still be effective,' he says.
His other concern is that the breeding material used in the development of
new varieties is not available in Colombia and is generally in decline
throughout the world. 'Unless the genetic resources are maintained, then we
may not be able to get the breeding material we need,' he warns. Cenicana is
trying to develop its own gene pool in order to make crosses and breed new
varieties.
While sugar originates in Papua New Guinea, germplasm collections are now
maintained chiefly in Cuba, France, India and the US.
'It will be a slow process but I think Colombia will eventually move over
towards green cane,' says Mr Cock. 'Australia has taken a big stride towards
eliminating burning.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japan urges beef import cuts to
aid farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S agriculture ministry is trying to stem a sharp fall in domestic beef
prices by curbing imports of beef, prompting concerns among leading beef
exporting countries including the US and Australia.
The ministry has asked domestic meat traders to cut back on excessive
purchases of foreign beef, and to import in an 'orderly' manner.
While a ministry official said that the request was not 'administrative
guidance' (an unwritten directive from bureaucrats), a US official
criticised the action as inappropriate, with influences other than market
forces affecting prices. 'The move goes against the principle of the (1988
beef and citrus) agreement,' he said.
The action comes as the new prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who is
calling for more transparency in government dealings, takes office. It
indicates that the old ways of the country's bureaucrats will die hard.
The Japanese beef market was opened in 1988 under strong pressure from the
US, with quotas abolished in 1991. Imports for the year to last March surged
29 per cent from the previous year's level, to 423,000 tonnes. The tariff
cut at the begining of April from 60 per cent to 50 per cent further boosted
import growth by a year-on-year 30 per cent during the April to June
quarter.
Agriculture ministry officials say wholesale beef prices have fallen by as
much as 60 per cent since the market was opened. The recent fall in consumer
confidence has prompted a shift from expensive Japanese beef to cheaper
imports, and the higher yen has further lowered the price of foreign beef.
Although Mr Hosokawa has stressed the shift to a consumer-oriented market
from the supplier-focused tradition, Japanese beef producers have
considerable political clout and have been pressuring politicians,
particularly during the recent election campaign. The ministry official said
import restrictions could not be ruled out, if a further decline in prices
threatened the welfare of Japanese beef producers.
However, US and Australian officials insisted that Japan had no grounds for
imposing import restraints, as the agreements on beef included safeguard
measures to implement restrictions only if the import level climbed to
680,000 tonnes.

After attempting to consolidate above Dollars 380 an ounce the London GOLD
price moved lower in line with a weaker tone in New York. At the close it
was quoted at Dollars 379.20 an ounce, down Dollars 3.05 on the day. 'We got
trade selling with a vacuum on the downside,' said one New York dealer.
'We've been unable to get above the unchanged level, much less above
yesterday's high of Dollars 387.20 (for the December futures position).'
ZINC'S recent decline was temporarily halted and after setting a fresh
six-year low of Dollars 878 a tonne, the London Metal Exchange three months
price rallied on trade support to end the kerb session at Dollars 890 a
tonne, up Dollars 6. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices,
supported by an initially firmer New York market and weaker sterling, closed
up to Pounds 3 higher in active months but in routine total turnover of
4,814 lots. But traders did not rule out the possibility of a further slide.
COFFEE prices dropped back from morning highs in what dealers said was a
slight correction to an exaggerated upward move on Monday.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper market remains tense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER'S PRICE fell sharply on the London Metal Exchange yesterday but the
severe technical supply tightness for September to November did not ease and
the market remained very tense and nervous.
Yesterday's fall was triggered by a US fund unwinding buying contracts late
on Monday, traders said. The volume was 'hefty' and caused a knock-on effect
in early LME trading.
Cash copper closed Dollars 20.50 down at Dollars 1,937 a tonne, while
three-months metal was Dollars 1,896.50, down Dollars 41.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, said the near-term outlook for copper had deteriorated
recently. This was reflected in a further increase in LME copper stocks
yesterday to 471,900 tonnes, a 15-year peak.
He said: 'If the squeeze is maintained, prices could move higher as the
September options declaration approaches. But, if our assessment of the
fundamentals is correct, a very sharp reversal could be in prospect.'

firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GOLD'S RECENT price rise came just in time to save 30 to 40 junior
Australian exploration and mining companies, said Mr Ross Louthean, managing
director of the Australian mining publishing and research company, Resource
Information Unit, yesterday.
Many junior companies 'were hanging on by the knuckles', without cash to
explore and a poor climate for joint ventures. Now they had been able to
raise cash and money spent on minerals exploration would jump by at least 40
per cent this year, he said, at the launch of the latest edition of the
Register of Australian Mining which lists every mining, oil and gas project
from Admiral Hill to Zeolite Australia.
Every available drilling rig was at work - including some that should have
been retired years ago - and Australia was on track to maintain its position
as the third or fourth-largest gold producer in the world.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government supports mine over
aborigine land claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S federal government, under pressure from miners and state
governments, yesterday gave its support to a Queensland aluminium and
bauxite project that promises 2,000 jobs but is under threat from an
aboriginal land claim.
Mr Michael Lavarch, the attorney general, said legislation protecting
Comalco's Weipa project, the first working mine to be hit by a native title
claim, may be introduced in September. 'The mining leases which Comalco hold
will be validated,' he said in a radio interview.
The Weipa bauxite mine leases are included in a claim by the aboriginal Wik
people for more than 35,000 sq km of land on the western side of Cape York
peninsula.
A landmark 1992 high court case, known as the Mabo case after one of the
aboriginal litigants, established aboriginal native title. It ruled that
where aborigines could prove a continuing relationship with their
traditional lands, their native title might not have been extinguished by
white settlement.
Comalco, 67 per cent owned by CRA, had said the aboriginal claim would scare
off lenders from a planned ADollars 1.83bn (Pounds 830m) expansion of its
smelter and electricity generating operations at the port of Gladstone.
It declined to comment on Mr Lavarch's remarks. But Mr Lauchlan McIntosh,
executive director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, praised the
move. 'Mr Lavarch has seen the value of the project to Australia,' he said.

FT  11 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank's stance disappoints Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK'S repo announcement yesterday provided the main focus of
attention for the European government bond markets, as dealers and investors
waited for signs that the German central bank would allow an easing.
In the event, the Bundesbank left its 14-day repo rate at 6.80 per cent,
unchanged on the previous week and only 5 basis points above the
Bundesbank's discount rate which usually acts as the floor for money market
rates.
While expectations of a cut had not been very strong before the repo, there
was clearly disappointment that the Bundesbank failed to ease.
'The Bundesbank is keeping its cards close to its chest, and this move has
dampened down the (discount) rate cut speculation,' said one dealer.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 97.10, slipped back to a
low of 97.03 on the repo news but later moved up to reach a high of 97.36 in
average volume.
Mr Philip Tyson, European economist at Yamaichi International, pointed out
that the Bundesbank's tough stance on the interest rate front 'bodes well
for the inflation outlook and helps the long end of the market'.
ALTHOUGH the short end of the bond market slipped slightly yesterday, the
rally in longer-dated US Treasury prices showed no signs of abating as
yields fell further into record low territory.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 108
27/32 , yielding 6.449 per cent, another new all-time low. At the short end
of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.083
per cent.
Although trading throughout the day was relatively subdued, prices sustained
their upward momentum at the long end of the market. Dealers said there was
nothing particularly new behind the long end's advance, which was put down
to the follow-through from overnight buying in Japan, and to pre-auction
jockeying.
In the afternoon, the Treasury auctioned Dollars 16.5bn in three-year notes,
the first part of its latest refunding round. The sale went relatively well,
although retail interest was slightly disappointing. The remaining two
tranches of the refunding will be auctioned today and tomorrow.
THE Banque de France left its overnight rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent,
disappointing those who believe the rate could comfortably be lowered at any
time.
Long-dated government bonds ended firmer on the day, and the Matif September
bond futures contract ended floor trading at 122.28, up 0.36.
MEDIUM and long-dated UK government bonds gained over a quarter of a point
as foreign investors continued to buy the gilt market, inspired by the
favourable inflation outlook.
In the futures market, the September gilt futures contract broke through the
112 level to end at 112.01, up from 111.15 at the previous day's close.
The market is waiting for the release tomorrow of July unemployment figures
and June average earnings and industrial production data.
THE JAPANESE government bond market ended firmer, supported by the strength
of the yen against the dollar and hopes that the Bank of Japan will ease
monetary policy in the next few months.
The September futures contract opened at 111.67 and reached a high of 111.78
before ending at 111.70.

1987 crash loan

<TEXT>
THE HONG Kong Futures market will on Friday repay the special HKDollars
1.93bn (USDollars 249m) 'lifeboat' loan which rescued it from bankruptcy
after the October 1987 stock market crash.
Since the crash, the government has imposed a 0.3 per cent levy on all stock
exchange transactions, and a HKDollars 30 levy (subsequently reduced to
HKDollars 5) on all Hang Seng Index futures contracts, to help repay the
loan.
These special levies will be suspended after the close of trading on Friday.
The Hang Seng Index futures contract had been the second most active in the
world in 1987, but after the four-day closure of the stock market from
October 19, members of the Futures Exchange defaulted on HKDollars 1.8bn
worth of obligations.
It is only in the past 12 months that the futures market has seen a recovery
in turnover, and the suspension of the levy is expected to encourage greater
liquidity.
Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said: 'The suspension
of the special levy clears up the last outstanding issue left over from the
1987 market crash, which can finally be regarded as a matter of history.'

FT  11 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for asset-backed FRNs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market was enlivened yesterday by the launch of the
first securitisation of consumer loans in the sterling sector.
Demand from domestic and foreign investors for the Pounds 190m offering of
asset-backed floating-rate notes, issued by First National Finance
Corporation, was such that the entire deal was placed by late afternoon,
according to the underwriter, Baring Brothers.
Mr Tim Ingram, group finance director of First National Finance Corporation,
said the company planned at least two public securitisations a year, the
purpose of which would be to reduce bank debt.
The issue was made up of Pounds 170m of senior Triple A notes and supported
by a Pounds 20m tranche of mezzanine subordinated notes. The notes are
backed by 80,000 unsecured consumer loans, advanced for home improvements,
and are expected to have an average life of just under four years.
Barings said the notes offered investors a return of 55 basis points over
the three-month Sterling London Inter Bank Offered Rate (Libor). The notes
were priced at a slight discount to par and were offered at par when they
were freed to trade in the late afternoon.
Also in the sterling sector, English &amp; Scottish Investors raised Pounds 25m
through the issue of debenture stock due 2023.
The stock's gross redemption yield was fixed at 75 basis points over the
semi-annual yield of the UK Treasury's 8 3/4 per cent stock due 2017, which
stood at 8.282 per cent yesterday.
Mr John Cameron, director at the underwriters, Kleinwort Benson, said that
the stock's coupon of 8 1/4 per cent represented the lowest borrowing cost
for an investment trust since the 1960s.
Elsewhere, Commerzbank raised DM500m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds
with a coupon of 6 per cent. An official said the break-even price for
underwriters was 99.20 and that the bonds were being offered at 99.35 in the
afternoon. He added that the bonds were being placed in Switzerland, the
Benelux countries and through the bank's domestic retail network.
Syndicate managers said that the recent volatility in the European exchange
rate mechanism and hopes of a cut in German interest rates had increased the
attraction of the D-Mark sector.

FT  11 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Slow ahead for privatisation
of Greek groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK privatisation, beset with legal obstacles, political opposition and
union resistance, is making painfully slow progress.
The diversity of state-controlled assets for sale in 1990 created problems
for the government in setting priorities for disposal. The 200 or so
companies on offer amounted to a cross-section of the economy, ranging from
small textile and white goods producers to major concerns like shipyards,
banks and cement makers.
To underline the official commitment to transparency, the government
selected prestigious international banks to advise on disposals, but often
with considerable delay.
Credit Suisse First Boston has done best, advising on the sale of a 35 per
cent strategic stake in OTE, the state telecommunications company, and also
acting as joint global co-ordinator, with J. Henry Schroder Wagg, for the
flotation of another 14 per cent of the company on the Athens stock
exchange.
CSFB is also advising the government on the sale of two state-owned oil
refineries and the National Bank of Greece on disposing of several luxury
resort hotels.
NM Rothschild, the government's overall adviser on privatisation, was given
the job of co-lead manager for the international tranche of the
telecommunications group IPO.
However, the foreign advisers failed to persuade the government to set clear
regulations for the privatisation process. As a result, disposals were at
first carried out piecemeal.
It was not until Mr Stefanos Manos, a keen advocate of unbundling the state,
took over both the economy ministry and the privatisation portfolio that the
pace of disposals picked up.
To date, about 70 companies have been unloaded, raising Dr200bn (Dollars
850m), of which Dr124bn came from the sale of Heracles General Cement to
Calcestruzzi, a subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group. This year's budget
target for privatisation revenues is Dr330bn, to be covered by the sale of
OTE and the two refineries.
While most sales so far have been direct, the Athens stock exchange is
becoming a vehicle for disposals. The government recently sold a 37 per cent
stake in Hellenic Sugar, the state sugar producer, for Dr7.1bn. Two more
state banks will be privatised through the bourse this year, following the
sale by public tender of Bank of Athens to Korea's Hanwha group for Dr6.2bn.
However, plans to sell a 49 per cent stake in Olympic Airways, the state
carrier, are on hold while the airline is being restructured.
Moreover, both major sales in 1992 have run into problems that will affect
future disposals. Heracles will probably be put up for sale again later this
year because of Ferruzzi's political and financial difficulties.
At Eleusis Shipyards, sold by Commercial Bank for Dollars 12m to NJ
Peratikos, a London-based Greek shipping group, labour problems, left
unresolved in the interests of bringing off the sale, have intensified since
the new owners took over. This has proved a deterrent to other leading Greek
shipowners being courted by the government to take over Hellenic Shipyards,
the state-owned yard.
Even the OTE sale is developing into a cliffhanger, with the government
being forced to delay the passage of enabling legislation, which would
transfer management to the strategic investor, because of opposition from a
faction in the ruling conservative party.
However, if either the sale or flotation, where the international tranche
amounts to 5 per cent, fall victim to additional delay, bidders may turn to
other international telecommunications offerings, dealing a heavy blow to
Greek credibility in financial markets.

TANDY Corporation, one of the largest US consumer electronics retailers and
manufacturers, yesterday disappointed Wall Street by reporting
second-quarter income from continuing operations of Dollars 31.7m, or 38
cents a share.
A year earlier, it recorded earnings from continuing operations of Dollars
42.7m, or 52 cents a share. Sales and revenues rose to Dollars 843.1m in the
1993 quarter from Dollars 801.9m last year.
Most analysts had expected the company to post profits of 43 cents a share
in the latest quarter, although some estimates were as low as 35 cents. At
the close in New York, shares in Tandy had fallen Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
28 7/8 .
Tandy's results were muddied in both years by one-time items. In the 1993
quarter, it suffered a loss from discontinued operations of Dollars 109.1m.
A year earlier, one-time gains of Dollars 19m from the sale of a Japanese
subsidiary were partly offset by a loss from discontinued operations of
Dollars 14.6m.
Including these items, Tandy posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars
77.3m, or Dollars 1.01, compared with net income of Dollars 28.1m, or 34
cents a year earlier.
For the first half, income from continuing operations slipped to Dollars
72.5m, or 88 cents, from Dollars 82m, or 97 cents the previous year.

<TEXT>
DOMINION Textile, the Canadian-based international integrated textile group,
continued its recovery in the fourth quarter, mainly due to strengths in the
denim market.
Operating profit was CDollars 38.1m (USDollars 29.3m), up 13 per cent, on
sales of CDollars 361m, a rise of 4.9 per cent on a continuing basis.
Final net profit for the year ended June 30, after special items, was
CDollars 30.3m, or 68 cents, against a loss of CDollars 74.8m, or CDollars
2.31, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.33bn, compared with CDollars
1.37bn. The 1992 loss included a CDollars 65m special charge.
'Fiscal 1993 was our best performance in five years,' said Mr Charles
Hantho, chairman. 'And we see the improvement continuing into fiscal 1994.'
Domtex has restructured to meet competition, and is a leading denim and yarn
producer. Most of its plants are in the US and Canada, with others in
Europe, north Africa and south-east Asia.

WAL-MART Stores, the top-selling retailer in the US, yesterday reported an
18 per cent increase in after-tax profits during the second quarter of 1993,
at Dollars 495.9m.
Earnings per share in the three months to end-July rose from 18 to 22 cents,
while sales were up by 25 per cent at Dollars 16.2bn.
The second-quarter figures brought Wal-Mart's profits for the first half of
the financial year to Dollars 946.5m after tax, compared with Dollars 807.4m
at the same stage in 1992.
Sales for the most recent six months stand at Dollars 30.2bn, against
Dollars 24.7bn in the first half of the previous year.
Yesterday, Mr David Glass, chief executive, said the company was 'on track
to achieve sales and earnings objectives for the balance of the year'.
However, he also conceded the year so far had been 'characterised by
disinflation and consumer caution'.
On Wall Street, the news was greeted without enthusiasm, and Wal-Mart shares
eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25 - near the 52-week low.
The Arkansas-based company - a high-flier in the retail sector for many
years - has faced questions recently over the growth potential for Sam's,
its warehouse club chain, and the fate of its new generation of giant
'combo' stores, which combine food retailing with general merchandise.
In the second quarter, Wal-Mart said it had opened 21 new Wal-Mart stores
and 33 Sam's Clubs (including 14 Pace club stores which were acquired from
Kmart, a rival discount retailer).
Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer, disclosed a 2.4 per cent increase in
second-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 42.7m, although the six-month
figure was down by 14.7 per cent, at Dollars 53.9m. Sales in the period rose
by 6.9 per cent, to Dollars 1.02bn, and for the six months by 6 per cent to
Dollars 1.71bn.

PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, restaurants and snack foods group, plans to
invest about Dollars 500m in Poland over the next five years.
The money - which PepsiCo claims is one of the largest single investment
programmes by a consumer products company in Poland - will go into a range
of businesses.
On the restaurant side, it intends to open Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried
Chicken, and '3-in-1' outlets in Warsaw and other cities. The '3-in-1'
outlets combine the three PepsiCo chains - KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -
under one roof.
The US group also plans to open a new salty snack plant at Grodzisk; to
broaden its local beverage distribution; and to upgrade and expand bottling
facilities.
The company also said it planned to raise its stake in Wedel, the Polish
chocolate, biscuit and confectionery products company, to 70 per cent by
1994. The US group acquired a 40 per cent interest in Wedel in 1991.
It added that it expected sales of PepsiCo-related businesses in Poland to
top Dollars 100m this year, and to reach more than Dollars 600m by the end
of the decade.

FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sincere payments re-define
executive mores - A look at boardroom remuneration in Hong Kong business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPLOITATION of minority shareholders is so much part of the corporate
culture in Hong Kong, that the boundaries of the acceptable have become
totally muddied. Department store operator Sincere, however, may have aided
definition when it proposed that directors' remuneration be 245 per cent of
net profit.
At an annual general meeting last week, Sincere's shareholders approved
directors' payments of HKDollars 115m (USDollars 14.8m) for the year to
February 1993, compared with net profit before extraordinary items of
HKDollars 47m.
By comparison, one of Hong Kong's largest companies, Hutchison Whampoa, paid
out directors' remuneration of HKDollars 67m last year, against net profit
of HKDollars 3.05bn.
The rarely outspoken Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators
in Hong Kong is to publish an editorial in its magazine claiming the move by
Sincere's directors 'is beyond bold - it is obscene'. In Hong Kong, making
money is rarely a dirty phrase.
Sincere is typical of Hong Kong's smaller listed groups; the board of
directors is tightly controlled by one family, the Mas, who make up seven of
the company's eight directors; the eighth is Mr Selwyn Mar, whose family has
long been connected with the owners.
Sincere is also representative of the Hong Kong inclination towards trading
property assets, and this has proven a lucrative combination.
In April 1992, the company sold its headquarters for HKDollars 1.18bn and
then paid out a special bonus dividend of 60 cents a share. This represented
a pay-out of more than HKDollars 160m, allowing the Ma family to reap some
rewards from the transaction.
However, it has only come to light now that the executive directors paid
themselves an additional HKDollars 67m bonus for their role in this
transaction.
It still remains unclear how they have justified paying themselves what
amounts to a 17 per cent transaction fee. They had already received as
ordinary remuneration the equivalent of the company's entire net profit
before extraordinary items.
This is no isolated incident. Hong Kong's minority shareholders rarely
challenge directors, and it has become accepted that certain groups carry
exceptional risk/reward profiles.
Evergo Holdings, run by the Lau Brothers, instigated one of the more
notorious payment schemes when its four family directors increased their
remuneration by 32 per cent to HKDollars 60.8m in 1990, a year in which the
company posted a net loss of HKDollars 13.4m.
Although the package was approved by shareholders, the Laus eventually
agreed to reimburse HKDollars 15m of their pay through a bonus dividend, in
response to the subsequent public uproar.
The UK's Cadbury report addresses the issue of directors' reimbursement in
detail, but since most Hong Kong companies have yet to take up the primary
recommendation of introducing a broad base of independent directors, there
seems little hope of short-term change.
However, Hong Kong's regulators are keen to demonstrate the stock market is
evolving. In the past year, the government has appointed inspectors to
examine accusations of alleged corporate misfeasance by two large groups,
Allied and Tomson Pacific.
This has coincided with a tightening of the rules on disclosure, and an
increasing willingness on the part of the stock exchange to investigate
suspected abuses of minority shareholders and extreme price movements in
shares. However, few investigations have borne fruit.
Mr Herbert Hui, head of the stock exchange's listing division, said the
exchange was 'looking into' the issue of Sincere's remuneration policy, and
the company had been put under pressure to release a more detailed
explanation to shareholders.
One irony in the furore over Sincere is that when Mr Selwyn Mar took on the
job of managing director in 1989, he allowed himself only a nominal salary
of HKDollars 1 per year, and said he was going to shake up the 90-year-old
department store group.
As Mr Archie Hart, research director of Crosby Securities, said: 'Whatever
Cadbury means to UK institutions, in Hong Kong it is still just a chocolate
bar.'

CSR, the Australian resources group, has joined with Australia's Mackay
Refined Sugars, and ED &amp; F Man, the UK sugar trading company, in a venture
aimed at increasing exports of refined sugar.
The new company will assemble CSR's established Australian sugar refining
assets, a new ADollars 80m (USDollars 54.4m) refinery being built by Mackay
in Queensland, a new dedicated vessel, and Man's marketing expertise. It
will be controlled 50 per cent by CSR and 25 per cent each by Mackay and
Man.
Mr Geoff Kells, CSR managing director, said the venture would seek new
markets for Australia's sugar exports. 'This new joint venture means that
for the first time Australia will become an exporter of value-added white
refined sugar,' Mr Kells said.
'At present, nearly all of the sugar which Australia exports is raw. World
trade in raw sugar has been relatively static in recent years. However,
world trade in refined sugar has expanded and demand is expected to continue
to increase.'

THE WOES at The Limited, one of the biggest clothing retailers in the US,
continued yesterday when it unveiled a 15 per cent fall in second-quarter
profits, to Dollars 68.2m after tax.
Sales increased by 13 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn, while earnings per share
slipped to 19 cents from 22 cents.
Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman, said he was 'very disappointed' with the results
and did not 'accept external causes as an excuse for our sub-standard
performance'.
He admitted the company had 'been promotional' across all its businesses to
ensure stocks were in line for the autumn season, but added that he believed
this was the 'correct action'.
Throughout the 1980s, The Limited - which takes in the likes of Express,
Lane Bryant, Victoria's Secret and the Bath and Body Works chains - was
hailed as one of the retailing industry's innovators, but it has struggled
recently.
Some analysts claim the group seemed to lose direction, and like all
retailers it has faced acute price competition.
At Dillard Department Stores, the Arkansas-based group, after-tax profits
rose to Dollars 39.2m from Dollars 36.5m in the second quarter, with sales
increasing to Dollars 1.10bn from Dollars 974.9m.
The company said same-store sales over the second quarter rose by 4 per
cent, and earnings per share rose to 35 cents from 33 cents.

FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand treads break-up path
 -The South African industrial group's plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE writing had long been on the wall for Barlow Rand, South Africa's
largest industrial group, which announced this week it will be breaking into
four separate companies.
Spurred by years of flat growth, under-performance of the share, and highly
publicised bad investments, especially in the mining area, analysts had been
asking some hard questions about Barlows' performance.
To that extent, this week's announcement, which follows indications in June
the group may be going along the break-up path, was no surprise.
Barlows will be split into four main divisions: Barlow Rand, with activities
ranging from domestic appliances to capital equipment; CG Smith, focusing on
consumer spending; Reunert, on electronics and engineering; and Rand
Mines/Rand Mines Properties, with Randcoal the main asset.
The share prices of Barlow Rand, CG Smith and Reunert have hardly moved
since the announcement, suggesting the full import of the deal has yet to be
properly digested.
The outlook for the various groups is difficult to predict as the deal will
only be finalised in September, to take effect in February, and only then
will the new managements be able to start discussing their plans. All will
start with seasoned managements and little debt.
Much also depends on the strength and shape of an economic upturn of which
there are now signs. CG Smith, with such powerful companies as Tiger Oats,
Nampak and Adcock Ingram, and Reunert look like doing well while the rest of
Barlow Rand will lag.
This might, however, be proved wrong, especially if a new government spends
heavily on a national reconstruction programme.
What came as a surprise in the whole process was the speed at which
executives acted. Just 10 days before the June announcement, senior
executives were strenuously contesting that unbundling was the correct path
to take.
The speed with which Barlows embraced unbundling did not only surprise
observers. When a three-man committee (comprising managing director Derek
Cooper, Robbie Williams of Tiger Oats and non-executive director Dick Goss)
recommended to the board in June that Barlows should unbundle, it came as
news to many, including some of the executive directors.
The driving force behind the process was the chairman, Mr Warren Clewlow.
Although the investment community is lukewarm about Mr Clewlow, he is the
man they must thank for promoting a course most of them favour.
What prompted his decision? As one observer notes wryly: 'The road to
Damascus runs all over the place.'
Mr Clewlow said he started thinking about unbundling about a year ago when
he relinquished his chief executive role to Mr Derek Cooper, who became
managing director in January 1992.
The main concern was how to arrest the flat earnings performance of the past
four years (attributable profit fell to R849m (Dollars 252.6m) in 1992 from
R1bn in 1989). Other issues were how to take the group into the 'new South
Africa,' and how to expand it beyond South Africa's borders.
Mr Clewlow contends the existing structure - the product of diversification,
especially in the 1980s - could not feasibly have been extended further.
'There was no point in taking the group even further and further like this
(horizontal diversification).' He believes the next stage is to deepen -
rather than broaden - group activities.
Amid reports that many directors are unhappy about the break-up, Mr Clewlow
does not pretend his proposals met with universal acclaim. He does claim
that 'most' of the board supported the proposal 'strongly,' but admits that
'a lot' said they didn't like it, but were unable to suggest better ways of
facing the future.
Mr Clewlow argues that 'in the past 20 years the way the group has grown was
right,' but it is by no means a universal view.
One school of thought holds that Barlow Rand, in its current form, was
conceptually flawed. That view maintains it was not possible for it to be
committed both to developing brands, as the consumer activities require, and
to a cost-cutting culture in a commodity style business, with the aim of
being the lowest cost producer
The group has also suffered some grievous body blows in the recent past. The
assembled calamities on the mining side did grievous damage to its prestige
and credibility.
The catastrophic venture into platinum, through Barmines; the lossmaking
gold mines; the closures of the Vansa vanadium plant and the Barbrook gold
mine; the sale of Middelburg Steel - none of these redounds to Barlows'
credit.
Soon after acquiring control in 1971 of Rand Mines, the then chairman,
'Punch' Barlow, wrote: 'Our acquisition of Rand Mines brought us many more
problems than we anticipated.' He didn't know the half of it.

PEUGEOT-Citroen, the French car manufacturer, announced a 11.4 per cent fall
in sales in the first half of the year, reflecting the depressed state of
the European car market.
The company achieved sales of FFr73.05bn (Dollars 12.40bn) in the first six
months of 1993, compared with FFr82.4bn in the same period in 1992.
Peugeot-Citroen said the results reflected a continued decline in the
European car market, which saw sales of new vehicles fall by 17.4 per cent
in the first half of the year.
Motor industry analysts said they saw little prospect of rapid recovery in
the European car market, particularly in France and Germany, and forecast
that French car sales would fall by about 15 per cent this year.
The decline in sales at Peugeot-Citroen was aggravated by foreign exchange
movements, particularly the devaluations of the British pound and the
Italian lira. The company said that these effects accounted for about 4 per
cent of the decline in sales during the first half.
The company said it enjoyed strong sales in the British market and
consolidated its position in Germany. As a result, it maintained its share
of the European car market at 11.9 per cent in the first half.

alliance decision

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIAN Airlines has postponed a decision on future business alliances
until 'early autumn' following receipt of a specific proposal for
co-operation from Lufthansa, the German national airline.
Austrian was expected to make its decision next week on whether to join the
Alcazar project, which would link it with Swissair, SAS Scandinavian Airline
System and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, or pursue co-operation with Lufthansa
or Air France.
Lufthansa confirmed at the weekend that it had made a precise co-operation
proposal under which Austrian would be responsible for most flights between
Germany and Austria.
Austrian said only that it was in talks with Lufthansa, Air France and with
the Alcazar companies. Its board would take a position on these proposals
early in the autumn.
Analysts in Vienna said there were divisions within the Austrian board and
among the airline's workforce on which alliance to accept, but Alcazar still
appeared the better option.
'Austrian's main problem is transatlantic business, and Lufthansa would not
help because it has no US partner,' Ms Claudia Schwarz-Vartok, an analyst at
Die Erste Invest-Consult in Vienna, said.
Also, if Austrian joined Lufthansa, it would have to unwind the very
substantial co-operation arrangements it has with Swissair already on
maintenance, pilot training, flight numbering, sales offices and a frequent
flyer programme.
Flughafen Wien, the partially privatised operator of Vienna's international
airport, said the Austrian government was seeking to reduce its stake in the
group from 36.5 per cent to 25 per cent.
An initial offer would be made to the province of Lower Austria and the city
of Vienna, each of which holds 18.25 per cent. If they were not interested,
the shares would be offered to institutional investors by Bank Austria and
Warburg Securities.
Shares in Flughafen Wien were floated in Austrian and international stock
markets in June 1992.

FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker majority-owned by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa)
of Germany, reported a net loss of Fl 127m (Dollars 65m) for the first half
of 1993 and reaffirmed earlier forecasts of a full-year loss of around Fl
150m.
The first-half loss, which compares with a small profit of Fl 5.9m a year
earlier, includes a one-off charge of Fl 90m for cutting staff in line with
a reduction in aircraft output.
Turnover fell by 8 per cent to Fl 1.73bn and operating profit before

The company said that recent orders received for its 100-seat Fokker 100
were a first sign that parts of the depressed aircraft market was starting
to recover.

improvement

DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second-largest commercial bank, yesterday reported
a 14 per cent rise in group operating profits to DM936m (Dollars 544.10m) in
the first half of this year after a big rise in loan risk provisions.
The result, from the last of the big three German banks to report interim
figures, is in line with the much-improved figures reported by its domestic
competitors.
Commerzbank's group operating result was 16 per cent higher at DM392m, while
Deutsche Bank showed a 13 per cent increase to DM2.6bn. Both the Dresdner
and Deutsche comparisons are with half of the full 1992 result rather than
with the calendar January - June period.
One reason for the banks' stronger performance during the recession is the
steep rise in commission income, reflecting stronger securities trading.
Despite the weaker economy and high German interest rates, Dresdner said
short and long-term lending had increased.
Operating profits at the Dresdner parent bank were 12 per cent higher at
DM661m. Provisions for bad loan risks, which German banks are now releasing
in more detail ahead of the implementation of a new EC banking directive,
rose by 25 per cent to DM758m for the group and by 27 per cent to DM554m for
the parent bank.
Business in eastern Germany, where economic progress after unification has
fallen well short of expectations, accounted for most of Dresdner's risk
provisions. But bank officials said that these had been strengthened because
of the continuing unsettled state of the domestic economy.
Dresdner's group lending volume rose by 4 per cent to DM250bn, with business
volume 8 per cent higher at DM359bn. The parent bank's own lending increased
by nearly 5 per cent to DM146bn, comprising a 5 per cent rise in the short
and medium-term sector and one of 3 per cent in long-term corporate
business.

FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Banesto share issues raise
Pta95bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, Spain's fourth-largest commercial bank in terms of assets, has
completed the first part of its plan to boost its capital and reserves,
raising Pta94.9bn (Dollars 676m) via two share issues.
This 37 per cent equity increase so far boosts its Bank of International
Settlements (BIS) equity ratio to 11.3 per cent of assets.
With an issue of convertible bonds still planned to round off the capital
increases in the autumn, Banesto has already raised more money than any
Spanish financial or commercial institution.
The success of the issues could help counter long-standing criticism of the
bank's ability to finance further growth.
Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's president, said yesterday that the Pta94.9bn was
the third-largest capital increase by any bank in the world and that it
would be the biggest when at least Dollars 400m in dollar-denominated
convertible bonds was issued in late September.
He said that the two share issues, the first part of the overall capital
increase, had proved popular with Banesto shareholders and that the first
tranche of the money raised so far - Pta52.65bn - was oversubscribed by 20
per cent. A second tranche of Pta42.25bn was then used to attract a series
of private European and US investors.
The most prominent of these was the Corsair banking fund launched by JP
Morgan earlier this year, which invested Dollars 150m and, after the share
issues, holds a stake of around 6.4 per cent in Banesto.
At least two members of the Corsair funds, the GE pension fund and
Northwestern Mutual, a big Milwaukee-based insurer, also made individual
investments.
Mr Conde invested Dollars 50m, and said the money had come from his personal
funds. His own stake in the bank is close to 3 per cent. Other Banesto board
members invested Dollars 20m.
With net profits of more than Pta20bn from the sale earlier this year of its
Banco Madrid affiliate to Deutsche Bank, the capital increase removes any
doubts about Banesto's ability to finance its growth.
Mr Conde made clear he will continue disposing of assets in Banesto's
industrial holdings but that in the current business climate prices were not
good.
He said, though, that the implementation of the capital increase so far had
also made it very clear that Banesto's banking business was rapidly
improving.
Acting in the first tranche of the increase, its Spanish branch network
raised Pta18.2bn from existing shareholders and Pta19.7bn from more than
37,000 customers who had become shareholders through the exercise.

THE costs of the restructuring programme announced by Procter &amp; Gamble last
month, and some other large one-off charges, took the Cincinnati-based
consumer products group heavily into the red in the 12 months to end-June.
P&amp;G said yesterday that it made an after-tax loss of Dollars 656m in its
latest financial year. Sales were Dollars 30.4bn, up 3.6 per cent.
However, the deficit was due solely to P&amp;G's previously-announced Dollars
1.5bn after-tax reserve, designed to fund the cost-cutting moves announced
in mid-July, and a further Dollars 1bn non-cash charge to cover the new
accounting standards on retiree medical benefits and deferred taxes. Added
to a Dollars 200m restructuring provision, established last September to
cover the disposal of P&amp;G's fruit juice business, one-off charges reduced
P&amp;G's profits last year by Dollars 2.7bn.
Before these charges, P&amp;G said that after-tax earnings wereDollars 2.07bn,
11 per cent up on the Dollars 1.87bn of the previous year. Earnings per
share, ahead of charges, stood at Dollars 2.91, also up by 11 per cent.
In the fourth quarter, P&amp;G's after-tax profits - before the charges -
increased by just 1 per cent, to Dollars 341m, while sales increased by 3
per cent to Dollars 7.36bn. However, Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, noted that
pre-tax operating profits showed a more healthy 9 per cent increase.
In the US, underlying unit volume increased by 1 per cent during the year
overall, although by 6 per cent in the final quarter. The international
businesses saw a 10 per cent increase in unit volume during 1992-3.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VEBA, the German energy, chemicals and trading group, reported a 12 per cent
drop in pre-tax profit for the first half of 1993 to DM782m (Dollars
454.60m).
The company blamed the decline mainly on the difficult market in plastics
and rubber, reflecting in particular the troubles of the motor industry.
The effect of this was aggravated by worldwide over-capacity, tough price
competition and a rise in low-priced imports from eastern Europe.
Group net income was 13 per cent lower at DM316m. Veba said earnings per
share would show a more gentle decline as 1992 interim result included
extraordinary gains.
It said turnover for the period showed virtually no change at DM33.2bn.
Growth in electricity, oil and services was offset by declines in chemicals,
trading and transport.
The group expected no improvement in the profits and economic trend for the
second half of the year. It intended to cut costs further and increase oil
and chemicals productivity to boost competitiveness. The resulting charges
on profits would be offset by the profit on the sale of its industrial gas
business.
Veba, whose capital spending was 11 per cent higher in the first six months
at DM2bn, said it was optimistic that its cost-cutting measures would bear
fruit in 1994.
Last year, Veba managed to maintain its dividend at DM12 a share, despite a
15 per cent slide in net profits to DM1.04bn.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: US loan guarantees to back Pemex
bond issue
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROLEOS Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state oil company, will use its first
loan guarantees granted by the US Eximbank in 15 years to securitise a
Dollars 348m public bond offering.
Pemex has been given loan guarantees of Dollars 379.2m to finance US
drilling services and heavy marine construction in two fields in Campeche
Sound, west of the Yucatan peninsula. While holding on to exploration
rights, Pemex is inviting foreign and domestic oil firms to develop fields
on a turn-key basis.
Under the transaction, Pemex will borrow money from a facility set up by the
Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and guaranteed by the Eximbank. UBS will
then use the facility to securitise up to Dollars 348m of bonds. The bonds
would have a triple A rating and a seven-year maturity.
Pemex described the deal as 'a milestone of great importance'. The
transaction concludes lengthy negotiations with the Eximbank and would mark
the first time a Mexican company has used loan guarantees to securitise
public bonds, a way of lowering financial costs.
Pemex had hoped to borrow about Dollars 750m but the fields in the Campeche
Sound proved less extensive than once thought. However, the US Eximbank is
considering granting Pemex two further loan guarantees of Dollars 500m and
Dollars 200m respectively. Pemex also intends to use these loans to
securitise public bonds, says Rene Schmed of UBS.
Pemex was instrumental in persuading the Eximbank and US Securities and
Exchange Commission to allow loan guarantees to secure bond offerings. In
the handful of such deals the Eximbank has recently completed, secured bonds
trade about 40 - 50 basis points over Treasuries, according to UBS.
Banco Union, said net profit for the first half of 1993 was 115m new pesos,
a 314 per cent rise over the corresponding year-earlier period, Reuter
reports from Mexico City.
The bank reported a 93.5 per cent increase in assets to 14.2bn new pesos and
said loans had increased by 32.8 per cent since the end of 1992 to 11bn new
pesos.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The food retail sector faced another session of underperformance as
investors fretted over the possibility of an MMC inquiry into food price
collusion. A weekend press report suggested that the prospect of some sort
of official inquiry had increased because some of the leading companies had
jointly hired consultants to help fight a probe. However, Tesco managed to
climb 2 to 216p, the stock having crept on to a number of brokers buy lists
in the past week as some in the market have felt its recent falls overdone.
Elsewhere, J Sainsbury slipped 6 to 465p and Argyll Group 4 to 325p.
Most food manufacturing stocks also spent another session under a cloud as
BZW advised clients to stay underweight. Despite this, Northern Foods
managed a rise of 3 to 270p, while Dalgety put on 6 to 481p.
The financial sectors of the market continued to power ahead, led by the
banks. Standard Chartered maintained its recent outstanding performance,
breaching the 900p level for the first time and settling at a record closing
level of 899p, a net gain of 15, ahead of Thursday's interim figures.
Dealers expect the bank to report exceptionally good results, which will be
boosted by the bank's pre-eminent position in trading in so-called 'exotic'
currencies, outside of the big D-mark, dollar, Yen and sterling activities.
'There are big profits in trading in exotic currencies, where dealing
spreads are much wider and margins higher, ' said one banks specialist.
A growing stock shortage drove HSBC shares higher, with the 75p shares
closing 11 better at a record 725p.
Abbey National raced up 8 to 410p, after 412p, following a split buying
order. SG Warburg was the pick of a generally firm merchant banking area,
with one leading institution said to have been an aggressive buyer and keen
to move to a market weighting in the stock without worrying too much about
the price it paid. Warburg shares settled 11 up at a record 793p, also
helped by the recent upsurge in stock market activity. Analysts also pointed
to the recent spate of 'flabberghastingly good' results from the likes of
Midland Global Markets, BZW and NatWest Markets, as well as last week's
excellent figures from Kleinwort Benson. The latter rose 3 to 492p. The
boardroom shake-up boosted Union Discount 7 to 185p.
Persistent market talk of a potential bid for General Accident, with
Prudential mentioned as a possible predator, and hopes of an increase in the
interim dividend from 9.7p to 10p lifted GenAx shares 5 to 692p. GenAx kicks
off the composite insurance sector's interim reporting season this morning.
The range of analysts' forecasts is from Pounds 90m to around Pounds 125m,
compared with a Pounds 21m loss last year.
Commercial Union, scheduled to report interim profits of around Pounds 60m
against last times Pounds 18m loss when it reports tomorrow, rose 7 to 660p.
Talk of a consumer-led recovery continued to buoy up selected stores stocks.
Storehouse was the star performer, the shares surging 7 to 218p with 3.9m
traded. Dealers said Goldman Sachs was positive on the stock. GUS was lifted
by the good consumer credit figures. The 'A' shares agined 25 to 2010p.
Grand Metropolitan was the outstanding feature in the drinks sector as the
company announced a joint venture in Chile and continued to benefit from a
broker's buy note on Friday. The shares advanced 14 to 423p.
The sale by Bass of 44 pubs to Greene King in a Pounds 17.5m deal helped
both shares stay in positive territory. Bass shares climbed 3 to 479p and
Greene King 2 to 367p. Elsewhere, Scottish and Newcastle, which has lagged
behind in recent sessions, did some catching up. It closed 9 ahead at 458p.
Whitbread was also sought by bargain-hunters, rising 13 to 520p.
Recovery talk again buoyed up the leisure sector, with the latest research
note from Smith New Court underlining the more positive tone. Smith also
upgraded its profits forecasts for Thorn EMI, up 10 at 945p, and Rank
Organisation, ahead 9 at 759p. Hoteliers were wanted, Forte gaining 6 to
225p and Ladbroke 5 to 204p.
Scottish Power, due to go 'ex-dividend' next Monday, attracted strong
support from income funds, and closed 6 up at 341p.
A NatWest Securities 'buy' recommendation lifted Vodafone 13 more to 509p,
within 10p of its all-time high of 519p reached in June 1989. Turnover in
Vodafone shares, heavily bought by US investors in recent months, reached
9.2m.
EMAP, the consumer and business magazine publisher, jumped 9 to 348p,
recovering from recent weakness, on circulation gains released by Audit
Bureau Circulation figures and published in the trade press over the
weekend.
Shares in Europa Minerals held steady at 40p, with the market expecting a
statement today concerning progress towards the three-way merger planned
with Burmine and Austmin, both of Australia. The merger plan has been
challenged by Mount Edon which has suggested it may offer 34p for Europa,
but the stock market expects Europa to name today the blue chip merchant
banker chosen to push through the intended merger with the two Australian
companies.
Reuters Holdings up 38 to 1573 at the day's high, before the shares closed a
net 13 up at 1548p.
Among printers, De La Rue fell by 5 to 682p on profit-taking.
In a quiet textile sector. Albion, manufacturer of menswear, was up 3 to
110p.

A firm start to the day by the recently strongly performing drugs sector was
sharply reversed just before the close of trading as the market picked up
the scent of news of imminent price cuts about to be instigated by one of
the leading drugs suppliers.
Rhone Poulenc was said to be about to cut prices in a move expected to be
followed by other drug firms.
Glaxo, especially, was said to be exposed by price cutting moves and the
shares fell heavily in late trading to close a net 12 1/2 off at 516 1/2 p,

FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Large trades boost Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL and gas sector underperformed the wider market but provided the
stock market's most active stock in British Gas where turnover reached 18m
shares. Gas shares were sluggish for much of the session but picked up
towards the close to end the day a net 1 1/2 higher at 309 1/2 p.
Much of the action in the stock was concentrated in mid-session when a
series of hefty individual trades, including a block of 4.8m shares, another
of 4m and a number of 3m-plus trades moved through the Seaq dealing system.
Some dealers attributed the large-scale trades to a number of institutions
using Gas shares, always one of the market's heaviest trading issues, as a
vehicle to invest big sums of cash in the market. 'If the market is rising
and you want to shift cash into the market quickly, then Gas is one of the
best stocks to use,' said one leading trader in Gas shares.
It was also pointed out that the conclusions of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission's year-long investigation into the the gas industry will be
published next week. Publication of the full document is expected on
September 6.
There have been long-term worries in the market that British Gas will be
dismantled as the regulatory authorities continue to seek increased
competition in Gas's markets. But bulls of the stock push the view that the
company offers well above average 'real' dividend growth.

FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBDUED derivatives sector was reflected in poor turnover in both options
and futures markets, although the recent upward momentum in the latter was
maintained, writes Christopher Price.
The 4,924 contracts traded by the close in the September FT-SE was well down
on the recent busy sessions. Dealers said the weekend press reports of
imminent interest rate cuts backed by a bullish equity market run, were an
echo of the last two weeks' trading, and there were few investors left who
wanted to be convinced of the recovery story.
Trading in September during the morning session was marked by a dearth of
buyers as the contract edged forward. The first trade was struck at 2,890
and glided gently forward, not finding fresh momentum until Wall Street
opened strongly on the back of President Clinton's budget success.
Gilts added to the positive mood and September eventually closed with a spur
at 2,999, having touched 3,000. This was a 16-point premium to the fair
value level of around 3.
Traded options volume was also weak, with just 19,000 contracts being
traded, around half the previous session's total. The FT-SE contract traded
4,266, with the Euro FT-SE at 1,541.
Royal Insurance topped the list of stock options, reaching 1,732 by the
close. This was followed by Hanson on 1,024

FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index challenges 3,000 mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAVOURABLE data on the domestic economy and a cut in French interest rates
brought new peaks in UK stocks yesterday, as the FT-SE 100 Index market
mounted a challenge to the 3,000 mark which it will have in its sights when
it opens for business this morning. Encouragement for equities came from
stock index futures, where the September contract moved briefly above 3,000,
and also from continued firmness in British government bonds.
The reduction of a quarter of a point in the 24 hour lending rate of the
French central bank strengthened optimism in London that rate cuts in Europe
will open the way for a further cut in UK base rates, probably in the
autumn. Predictions in the City of London are that base rates will fall to 5
per cent.
Confidence in the progress of economic recovery in the UK was buttressed
yesterday by the latest statistics on UK producer prices and consumer
credit. Producer prices rose by 0.1 per cent in July, slightly less than
expected, while consumer credit increased to Pounds 4.69bn, supporting
expectations that consumer spending is leading the economy out of the
recession.
Economic optimis was also encouraged by reports that the Bank of England
quarterly bulletin, due today, will indicate that British firms have
survived the recent economic recession in better shape than they were after
the recession at the beginning of the 1980s.
The market advance was fairly restrained at first, however, and the new
intra day trading peak of 2,986.8 on the Footsie was not established until
late afternoon when London was cheered by an early gain of 20 Dow points
early in the New York session. The Footsie 100 Index closed 16.6 up at
2,986.4.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued its headlong advance, gaining 6.6 to yet
another new peak of 3,399.4. Private investors, who tend to concentrate on
the Mid 250 list, played a leading role in the market yesterday.
Trading in non-Footsie stocks expanded to make up around 60 per cent of the
day's Seaq total of 525.3m shares; on Friday, 681.3m shares traded through
the Seaq network, worth Pounds 1.48bn in retail or customer business. Retail
business has exceeded Pounds 1.37bn daily for the past nine trading
sessions, indicating a good level of profitability for the London-based
securities houses.
The big investment institutions were also buyers of UK stocks yesterday
although they were unwilling to chase share prices in a market now in such
clearly confident mood. High levels of turnover in such blue chip names as
British Gas and BT disclosed the presence of managers of the pension funds.
Very heavy trading was recorded in Pilkington, the UK glass manufacturer, as
rumours re-emerged that Pittsburgh Steel may yet make a bid for the equity.
The influence of the Wall Street market brought only modest support for the
heavyweight oil stocks and pharmaceuticals traced a somewaht uncertain path.
Consumer issues, including most of the leading retail stores, continued to
lead the advance in the interest-related sectors.
In the banking sector, which was still digesting last week's profits
statements from the leading UK houses, investors became more cautious in
their selection of shares.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Upturn may be jeopardised by more
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upturn in the fortunes of the insurance industry could prove short-lived
if the conclusions of a recent analysis by McKinsey &amp; Company, the
management consultants, are borne out, writes Richard Lapper.
Writing in the latest issue of The McKinsey Quarterly, Mr Michael Muth says
that competition will increase sharply following the deregulation of the
European market next year in line with European Commission directives.
He predicts that new specialised insurers, which have simplified and lean
cost structures, will grab market share from established multi-line
insurers.
Increasingly insurers will be competing for fewer customers as both domestic
and commercial customers opt to self-insure and predicts a 20 to 25 per cent
fall in premiums. 'Households and industrial corporations alike are opting
for self-insurance much more frequently.'
Mr Muth adds that insurers will be forced to make more efficient use of
capital in order to invest in systems and marketing.
'It is likely that the profitability of the European insurance industry will
continue to decline until a thorough shake-up has occurred and both
survivors and newcomers have redefined their roles in the market,' he says.
'The majority of today's players will therefore have to exit the business -
a shake-out like the one that occurred in the United States in the 1980s.'
Mr Muth says that the poor results experienced by most of Europe's main
companies in 1991 and 1992 did not 'reflect a temporary dip in the
underwriting cycle . . . but marked the onset of an unstoppable transition.'

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Firmer footing as clouds disperse - The
expectations of better results from the insurance companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THREE years of heavy losses, the insurance industry appears to be
decisively back on the road to profitability.
Three companies, General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance,
will this week report sharp improvements in pre-tax profits for the first
six months of 1993.
Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance are expected to follow suit within
the next four weeks.
Underpinning the turnround has been a combination of rate increases, a fall
in the frequency of claims and a gradual reduction in the burden of mortgage
indemnity insurance claims.
The Association of British Insurers reported a 7.5 per cent fall in theft
claims in the first quarter of 1993, compared with the same period of 1992.
That indicates that the high incidence of recession-related claims may be
beginning to tail off as a result of the first signs of economic recovery.
More importantly after the storm losses of 1990 and subsidence losses of
1990 and 1991, insurers benefited from mild weather last winter.
Subsidence claims in the first quarter were 60 per cent lower than the
corresponding 1992 quarter, which itself showed a big improvement on 1991.
Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, estimates that
losses from DMI policies, which insure mortgage lenders against part of any
losses they make when selling repossessed houses, will fall to Pounds 397m
in the first half of 1993 and less than Pounds 800m for the whole year. The
annual figures for 1992 and 1991 were Pounds 910m and Pounds 1.32bn
respectively.
In some cases, notably General Accident, companies have reduced costs by
rationalising back-room and sales operations and trimming management layers.
Trends in the capital and foreign currency markets have also been
favourable, helping to strengthen balance sheets dented by recent losses.
'Firm equity markets and more importantly bond market appreciation should
yield all the groups substantial capital gains,' says Mr John Chester, of SG
Warburg.
Mr Chester estimates that the net asset values of General Accident, GRE and
Royal have risen by 10 per cent over the past six months with Sun Alliance
showing an increase of 6 per cent.
He expects Commercial Union to record a 28 per cent enhancement in net asset
value due to the effects of February's rights issue.
Predictably analysts are expecting pre-tax profits for all companies in 1993
and the upturn to continue into 1994. A possible upturn in rates in the US
would provide a further fillip to profitability.
However, looking further ahead the picture is a good deal more murky. Part
of the reason is that there are already signs of rate competition returning
to some parts of the market, especially in motor business.
Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, says that the recovery has
been too strong. 'The industry is simply not going to be able to stand still
and allow the companies to make underwriting profits and increase prices at
the same time,' he says. He also predicts that direct telephone-based
companies such as Direct Line and Churchill will continue to grow strongly.
Mr Youseff Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley, agrees. 'Most underwriters now
accept that rates are fully adequate. We'll certainly see more evidence of
this in the second half and into next year.'

<TEXT>
Bass has sold 44 pubs, mainly in London and Surrey, to Greene King, the
regional brewer, for Pounds 17.5m cash.
The acquisition will increase the size of Greene King's estate to 870 pubs
and should be earnings-enhancing in the current year, Mr Tim Bridge, Greene
King's managing director, said yesterday.
'The properties are positioned within our strategic development area and
will make a significant positive impact on the managed house proportion of
our estate,' he added.
Greene King will take over the pubs gradually through next month, placing
most of them under management rather than tenancies.

In February, the group returned annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.45m,
against a loss of Pounds 17.5m. Dunkeld has debt of about Pounds 7m, the

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: ScotMet plans Pounds 47m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Metropolitan, Scotland's biggest property investment company, is
putting on the market Saltire Court, a prestige office development in
Edinburgh which is the company's largest single asset.
Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors, are to seek offers in the region of
Pounds 46.8m for Saltire Court. ScotMet said the proposed sale 'will create
a platform for the company to return to making selective investment
acquisitions in the north' (of Britain).
Saltire Court is an imposing stone-faced building containing 175,000 sq ft
of office space below Edinburgh Castle. It has succeeded in attracting firms
of solicitors and accountants to relocate from their traditional base in
Georgian buildings in Charlotte Square.
But it was only completed in late 1991 after the property boom had ended and
was initially slow to find tenants. However, it is now 92 per cent let with
tenants at headline rents in the region of Pounds 22-Pounds 23 per sq ft.
ScotMet plunged heavily into loss in 1991 mainly because of the collapse of
property values in the south and Mr Gordon Milne, managing director, who had
championed the Saltire Court project, resigned in early 1992, to be replaced
by Mr Scott Cairns.
Since then ScotMet has sold off Pounds 90m of assets to reduce borrowings,
which had been cut to Pounds 150m in April when the company announced a
return to profitability with pre-tax profits of Pounds 532,000 for the half
year to February 15 1993. Banking facilities were extended from October 1993
to October 1995.
Mr Cairns said that Saltire Court represented 15-20 per cent of ScotMet's
net assets of Pounds 285m as of last August which was too large a percentage
to have in one building.
He said the sale of Saltire Court was not required for the purpose of
reducing debt, although it would reduce the company's debts below its target
level.
'I always felt that Saltire Court formed too large a part of our assets,' Mr
Cairns said.
He added that ScotMet would now be investing in properties worth about
Pounds 5m each.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Billiton sells UK lead recycling operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILLITON, the Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and metals business, has
agreed to sell its lead recycling and fabrication businesses in the UK and
France to an investor group led by Quexco Incorporated, a private US
company.
The main subsidiary of Quexco is the RSR Corporation, a leading lead
recycling company in the US.
No price has been revealed for the transaction. It will include the Billiton
UK activities trading as HJ Enthoven, based in Darley Dale, Derbyshire,
which was part of Billiton when Shell took it over in 1970, as well as
British Lead Mills, acquired from GKN in 1977 and with sites in Welwyn
Garden City, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, London and St Helens.
Combined annual production in the UK is 100,000 tonnes of lead products.
These operations have turnover of about Pounds 50m and employ 365 people.
Billiton acquired Le Plomb Francais, which has 48 employees, from a private
seller in 1988. It has an annual output of 10,000 tonnes of lead products.
RSR has production facilities in New York, Indiana and California, producing
about 220,000 tonnes of lead a year.
Shell is negotiating the sale of most of Billiton's assets with Gencor of
South Africa but the European lead interests were excluded.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Govett &amp; Co shows advance to Dollars 22.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Govett &amp; Co, the fund management company, rose 23 per
cent to Dollars 22.8m (Pounds 15m) in the six months to June 30, compared
with Dollars 18.5m. Last year's figures have been adjusted to reflect a
change in accounting policy at the group's US insurance subsidiary.
Income from the institutional fund management and mutual fund business grew
from Dollars 6.34m to Dollars 8.37m, helped by stronger stock markets,
increased mutual fund sales in the US and the launch of a new investment
trust. Total funds under management are now Dollars 5bn, of which about
Dollars 1.5bn represents retail money.
London Pacific, the US insurance subsidiary, reported more than doubled
income of Dollars 8.24m (Dollars 3.36m), although Dollars 4m of that
represented one-off capital gains. Total assets at London Pacific are now
more than Dollars 800m.
Income from the venture capital arm fell from Dollars 3.7m to Dollars 3.41m.
Govett said that growing fee business was offset by lower placement volumes.
Investment income fell back to Dollars 4.19m (Dollars 6.69m) as a result of
lower interest rates and the company's programme of buying back about 11m
shares since mid-1992.
The buy-back programme, by reducing the amount of cash held in Jersey, has
also resulted in an increased tax charge to Dollars 5.73m (Dollars 2.74m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were 25.4 cents (20.3 cents) and the
interim dividend is increased 5.3 per cent from 9.5 cents to 10 cents.
The company recently announced the acquisition of a US trust company and
said it hoped to get a quote on the US Nasdaq exchange shortly.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Further sale nets Lucas Pounds 9m - On
target to complete Pounds 100m divestment programme by October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES, the engineering group which is refocusing on its core
activities, is on target to complete a Pounds 100m divestment programme by
the end of October.
This follows yesterday's sale of its aerospace engineering and heating
systems businesses.
The Luton-based business, which has assets of Pounds 8.8m, employs over 300
people and had turnover of more than Pounds 17m in 1992, has been sold to a
management-led buy-out team backed by UK financial institutions for Pounds
9m, and will trade under the new name Aerospace Composite Technologies.
The management buy-out of the engineering and heating business, which is
mainly involved in manufacturing high technology aircraft windows and
de-icing systems, means that three of the original four businesses
identified for divestment in October last year have now been sold.
Lucas' UK Autocentres business was sold to Lex Service for Pounds 13m in
March, the fluid power systems business went to Sophus Berendson for Pounds
40m the following month, and several smaller disposals have been completed
during the year bringing the total raised through the divestments to about
Pounds 70m.
The defence fabrications business based in Burnley, which manufactures
missile cases, and an acoustic instruments company in Hertfordshire remain
for sale together with the aerospace switchgear, ignition and wiring
businesses in Coventry and Newcastle-under-Lyme which were added to the list
of candidates for sale in March.
Proceeds of the sales are being ploughed back into Lucas' core operations in
the aerospace and automotive markets rather than being used to reduce debt,
and year-end gearing is expected to remain about 44 per cent.
Yesterday's sale to the existing management was the first MBO arranged by
Lucas in conjunction with NatWest Ventures and Montague Private Equity,
which co-led and jointly funded the institutional equity requirement for the
new company.
The existing management, led by Mr Phil Barrington, managing director, has
taken a minority shareholding in ACT and Bank of Scotland has provided debt
and working capital facilities.
ACT is a leading supplier of high technology cockpit windows for aircraft,
including windows with radar-defeating 'stealth' coatings and de-icing
equipment for aircraft including Concorde, Tornado fighters and the
Westland's new EH101 helicopter. The company also manufactures
electroluminescent lighting for aircraft and other applications.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: MTM cuts deficit to Pounds 11.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the chemicals company which in April sold most of its assets to reduce
debt, yesterday announced a reduction in losses from Pounds 28m to Pounds
11.9m pre-tax in the six months to end-June.
The deficit bore exceptional charges of Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 9.34m).
MTM has been reorganised under a reshuffled board since its shares collapsed
last year when a Serious Fraud Office enquiry was launched hard on the heels
of the company making two profit warnings in March 1992.
Mr David Swallow, the new chairman, said the company, which has Pounds 10.8m
in cash after the Pounds 100m sale of assets to rivals BTP, planned to
invest in new categories of 'science-based' businesses.
He said: 'The figures have limited relevance to the company's on-going
position with the exception of MTM Agrochemicals which remains within the
group.'
Turnover of Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 56.5m) included Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 45m)
from discontinued operations. Turnover on continuing operations - MTM
Agrochemicals - rose to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 11.5m).
That business contributed an operating profit of Pounds 296,000 compared
with losses of Pounds 10.3m in the previous period, which reflected
provisions for permanent diminution in assets following a revaluation.
Mr Swallow said that seasonal fluctuations in demand for MTM Agrochemicals
meant the second half would not match the first: 'However, the board
continues to expect the business to break even for the year as a whole.'
Total operating profits were Pounds 1.51m (loss of Pounds 9.45m).
The Pounds 9.64m exceptional charge represented a Pounds 31.3m loss on
disposal of discontinued operations, including Pounds 25.4m of goodwill
previously written off, partly offset by a Pounds 21.7m provision made in
1992.
Net interest payments were Pounds 3.77m (Pounds 4.78m). Losses per share
emerged at 60.6p, down from 157p.
Following a Pounds 28.9m debt into equity swap, net liabilities of Pounds
23.5m in the December 31 balance sheet had become net assets of Pounds 20m,
or 77p per share, by the half-way stage.
There is again no interim dividend.

BM Group, the engineering concern, said yesterday that its principal bankers
had extended the company's banking facilities for a further period to
September 6 while discussions continued regarding suitable longer-term
finance.
The company, which has debts of over Pounds 100m, is on schedule with its
survival plan, which is expected to cost about Pounds 42m in redundancies,
closures, disposals and write-offs.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Westminster Health beats forecast with rise
to Pounds 4.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER Health Care, the nursing home group, has beaten the profit
forecast made at its flotation in April.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-May were Pounds 4.28m compared to a
forecast Pounds 3.85m and Pounds 1.67m in 1991-92. The shares, floated at
260p, rose 3p to 307p.
Mr Pat Carter, chief executive, said the Community Care Act, which came into
effect on April 1, had boosted admissions in March, but caused a drop in
April. The rate of admissions had improved since then and was back to the
pre-March level.
The change to local authority - rather than central government - funding for
patients in nursing homes, had led to some rise in prices, he said. The
proportion of WHC's patients fully publicly funded had fallen from 58 to 48
per cent over the year, as WHC shifted the balance towards private patients,
who are charged more, and contracted beds.
Mr Carter said the reforms were on balance beneficial, with local authority
purchasers linking price to quality and paying a wider range of prices
according to needs, for instance paying more for dementia sufferers. Also
rates were varying geographically, allowing prices to rise in London and the
south-east which had been poorly served in the past.
Falling land prices in these areas meant WHC was increasing the proportion
of its homes in the south.
Group turnover rose 58 per cent, from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 36.9m, partly
through a 35 per cent increase in beds from 2,400 to 3,234 with 11 homes
opening during the year, and through average price rises of 5 per cent.
Operating profits were Pounds 9.16m (Pounds 5.35m) and the net interest
charge was Pounds 4.74m (Pounds 3.59m). The group received the Pounds 64m
net proceeds of the float late in the financial year. Mr Kent Phippen,
finance director, said borrowings were Pounds 52.5m at the start of the
financial year, and rose by Pounds 26.8m as capital expenditure totalled
Pounds 25.9m, but fell to Pounds 15m at the year end, thanks to the float
proceeds.
Debt was 17.8 per cent of shareholders funds. Mr Phippen said this was
projected to rise to over 30 per cent in the current year and to about 45
per cent in 1994-95. Capital spending in the current year was forecast at
some Pounds 24m with another 716 beds due to open. A further 700 beds were
planned in each of the next two financial years.
After a 15 per cent tax charge, earnings per share were 12.8p (5.3p)
compared to the flotation forecast of 11.7p. On a pro-forma basis, if the
group had had the float proceeds for the full year, earnings per share were
16p against a forecast of 15.6p. A 0.5p dividend is proposed, as forecast.
COMMENT
WHC has confirmed its position as one of the quality operators in the fast
expanding long-term care sector with these results. The float coincided with
a far-reaching shake-up in the industry, as the community care reforms came
into effect, which has had a dampening effect on occupancy rates in the
short term. However, WHC's homes are at the top end of the quality range and
it should benefit from the long term trends in the market. The shift towards
more private patients should help margins. Conservative forecasts for the
current year are about Pounds 10.5m pre-tax, though some go to Pounds 11.3m.
With a prospective p/e of 17, the shares are not cheap but still good value.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Woolwich more than doubled at Pounds 88m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWICH Building Society, the third biggest society by asset size,
yesterday disclosed that it had more than doubled pre-tax profits in the
first half of the year helped by a 35 per cent increase in mortgage lending.
The society, which will be displaced as the third largest if Leeds Permanent
and National &amp; Provincial merge as planned next year, raised pre-tax profit
to Pounds 88m (Pounds 36m) despite a 9.8 per cent rise in bad debt
provisions to Pounds 72.7m (Pounds 66.2m).
Operating profit rose 51 per cent to Pounds 160.6m (Pounds 106.7m). It also
disclosed that Woolwich Property Services, the estate agency subsidiary
which is one of the largest in the south-east with 257 offices, was trading
profitably.
Woolwich Property Services incurred a trading loss of Pounds 11m last year,
halving the previous loss. Estate agencies are heavily dependent on
transaction volumes for profit, and Woolwich said contracted sales were up
20 per cent.
Assets increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 24.4bn (Pounds 22.9bn), and gross
mortgage lending rose 35 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The
increase in lending was partly financed by a 50 per cent rise in net retail
receipts to Pounds 390m (Pounds 260m).
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive, said the boost in operating profit
partly reflected the depressed state of the housing market last year. But
the society was also 'seeing encouraging signs of improvement'.
The increase in income, combined with management expenses holding steady at
Pounds 155.8m (Pounds 155.4m), lowered the society's comparatively high
ratio of cost to income by 10 percentage points to 49.2 per cent (59.3 per
cent).
The society raised its proportion of funding from wholesale markets to 22.7
per cent (21.7 per cent) as non-retail funds in creased to Pounds 4.9bn
(Pounds 4.47bn). Retail funds from savers grew to Pounds 17.9bn (Pounds
17bn).

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold ends first day 26p higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Bakyrchik Gold, which offers an investment in a gold mining
venture in Kazakhstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, went to a premium
of more than 20 per cent when trading started yesterday.
London investors were asked to provide Pounds 9m by way of a placing by
stockbrokers Williams de Broe of 7.5m shares at 120p each. The shares closed
last night at 146p.
Mr Kevin Foo, BK Gold's London-based chief executive, said the issue had
been over-subscribed and allocations to institutions in Europe had to be
scaled down.
The promoters suggest that BK Gold is the only substantial 'pure gold'
company listed in London and that the flotation has provided an early
opportunity to invest in Kazakhstan.
The company has a joint venture with the Kazakhstan government to develop
the Bakyrchik gold mine, which has one of the world's biggest gold deposits
on the republic's north-eastern steppes.
If the first phase goes well, BK Gold intends to raise a further Pounds 75m
next year to increase annual gold production from 40,000 troy ounces to
230,000 ounces.
Minproc, the Australian natural resources and engineering group, and
Chilewich, a New York trading organisation, between them own 50 per cent of
BK Gold.
The chairman is Mr David Hooker, previously with Aberdeen Petroleum, while
two former RTZ executives are on the board. Mr Andrew Buxton, once an RTZ
main board director is a non-executive director and Mr Nicholas Bridgen, is
the finance director.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Unisys president quits in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNISYS, the US-based mainframe computer company which broke back into profit
last year, yesterday announced an organisational shake-up to give more
autonomy to its two fastest-growing business units.
The shake-up also resulted in the resignation of Mr Reto Braun, president
and chief operating officer.
Mr James Unruh, chairman, said: 'The intention was to flatten the corporate
structure. We eliminated the need for a chief operating officer function.'
The two businesses being given greater operational freedom cover consulting
services, and the provision of open systems. Together, they accounted for 29
per cent of the company's Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) sales in 1992.
'We're trying to achieve the advantages specialised companies have, without
losing the advantages of economy of scale and the breadth of market of large
companies,' Mr Unruh said.
He added that the move was not a prelude to the eventual hiving-off of the
two units, though he added: 'Ten years from now, the company will no doubt
look very different.'
The two units will have full control over their businesses, and will have
their own dedicated sales forces around the world.
Unisys also said that its business was being regrouped into three broad
divisions. These cover government systems, combining the former government
and defence systems groups; information services and systems, which includes
the three sales groups around the world and four product groups aimed at
different industry sectors; and computer systems, which would continue to
act as the mainframe manufacturing arm.
With the departure of Mr Braun, Mr Unruh said he was taking day-to-day
control of the information group, the largest of the three.
Unisys, created by the merger of the Burroughs and Sperry mainframe computer
businesses in 1986, experienced heavy losses from 1988 to 1991. Cost-cutting
had taken 'at least Dollars 1bn' out of the company's cost base since then,
Mr Unruh said.
He called yesterday's changes the second phase of Unisys's rehabilitation,
designed to boost income by making it more responsive to market
developments.
In a separate announcement, Moore Corporation, a Toronto-based business form
group, said that Mr Braun would be joining as chief executive at the
beginning of September.

FT  10 AUG 93 / RTZ cuts stake in Papuan gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, yesterday announced
plans to cut its stake in the Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea
 -the largest known gold deposit outside South Africa - from 80 per cent to
about 20 per cent in exchange for Dollars 108m (Pounds 72m) cash.
The UK group has wanted to reduce its exposure for some time to what it saw
as a marginal project. Lihir's gold is in the crater of an extinct volcano
full of hot water and technically difficult to extract.
However, analysts were surprised by the value put on the project, only
Dollars 300m, and by RTZ's new partner - Venezuelan Goldfields, a
Vancouver-listed company in which controversial promoter Mr Robert Friedland
is the biggest shareholder. RTZ has agreed to sell a near 20 per cent
indirect stake in Lihir to Vengold for Dollars 59.97m.
'This is all fairly peculiar,' said Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining
team at SG Warburg. 'It does not put a very large value on Lihir and why
sell to a small Canadian exploration company. Where is the synergy?'
Vengold will hold its interest in Lihir via RTZ's project parent company,
control of which will be retained by RTZ. The UK group will continue to
manage the project.
RTZ has also agreed to sell to Niugini Mining - part of Battle Mountain Gold
of the US - a further 16 per cent of Lihir, for Dollars 48m, to add to its
current 20 per cent. The deals have to be approved by the Papua New Guinea
government which has indicated it will take a 30 per cent shareholding. If
so, the RTZ/Vengold company will eventually control 40 per cent of Lihir and
Niugini 30 per cent.
The PNG government has been pressing RTZ for a quick decision on Lihir
because it needs the income stream from the mine. The deposit contains
nearly 14m ounces of mineable gold and the partners expect to produce
620,000 ounces a year.
The government recently threatened to take 50 per cent of the project to
speed things up and in June offered - without RTZ's approval - a 20 per cent
stake to the Malaysian Mining Corporation. RTZ said it had not talked to
MMC. There is incentive for the government to give approval because RTZ said
construction could start earlier than expected, in 1994, and take only 28
months. Also, a final cost estimate is expected to be lower than the
previous one of Dollars 767m.
Some analysts suggested it was not the quality of the project that caused
RTZ to reduce its stake but the perceived political risks of mining in PNG.
RTZ's Australian associate, CRA, closed the Bougainville copper mine, one of
the world's biggest, three years ago because of a violent uprising and this
year the government was involved in disputes about the Mt Kare and Porgera
gold mines.

FT  10 AUG 93 / A test for the catastrophe theory of lending: The risks that
follow a US banking revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is this an accident waiting to happen? First-half results from the biggest
US commercial banks have confirmed their rapid return to financial health,
leaving them among the best-capitalised banks in the world.
Recent history, though, has shown the banks to be profligate users of their
shareholders' capital - from lending to lesser developed countries at the
start of the 1980s to the credit-driven boom in property and corporate deals
at the end of it. The fashionable sport for observers of US banking now is
to spot where the next disaster will come from.
The banks' recuperation, revealed by their second-quarter figures, has been
faster than most analysts expected. With US property prices bottoming out,
and improved profitability and lower debt levels among their corporate
customers, the overall asset quality of most banks has turned markedly
upwards.
Total non-performing loans held by the 42 big US banks followed by Ibca, the
UK-based bank rating agency, fell by Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 2.21bn) during
the second quarter. At Dollars 31.1bn, troubled loans are nearly a third
lower than a year ago.
It will take some time to clear the decks. At the end of June, the banks
were also sitting on property with a written-down value of Dollars 14.2bn.
Banks such as Citicorp (which accounts for Dollars 3.5bn of this) have said
they will sell only when they can realise favourable prices.
The improvement in the quality of bank assets was reflected in lower
provisions to cover potential credit losses. Added to high lending margins -
the average is still about 4 per cent - and record profits from trading in
foreign exchange and other markets, this boosted earnings. The Dollars 5.8bn
of after-tax profits made by the 42 banks covered by Ibca was Dollars 2bn
more than in the second quarter of 1992, further strengthening capital
ratios.
Even Citicorp, recently the stumbling giant of US banking, managed a tier
one capital ratio of 5.7 per cent at the end of June, up from 4.25 per cent.
Others strengthened what were already respectable capital levels compared
with the internationally agreed minimum of 4 per cent: BankAmerica reached a
tier one level of 6.9 per cent and the rest of the top 10 banks achieved
more than 7 per cent.
But will this renewed balance-sheet health herald another stampede into
risky lending?
So far, the signs are that both the banks and their customers are more
cautious this time around. 'The tendency is to go from one extreme to the
other,' says Mr Bill Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank. Individual lending
officers are prone to be over-cautious after recent loan-loss experience.
Mr Richard Boyle, vice chairman in charge of credit policy at Chase
Manhattan, agrees. 'Risk appetite is going to be a bit abated. The hurdle
for acceptability of credit is higher than when this cycle started.'
There is also a lack of demand for loans. With economic recovery proceeding
at a slow pace, companies have yet to build up stocks so keeping a lid on
their financing requirements.
Federal Reserve figures bear this out. In June, banks' commercial and
industrial loans averaged Dollars 594bn, a slight recovery after a steady
decline in the six months to March, but still below year-ago levels.
Bank lending has picked up in the states that have seen the quickest return
to economic health. NationsBank, the North Carolina-based bank which has
vaulted by acquisition into the top five, reported 'accelerating loan
growth' at the end of the quarter, with loan balances up by more than 10 per
cent on a year earlier. At Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, new
residential mortgages and consumer loans helped push up lending at an
annualised rate of 14 per cent.
For banks which lend to large companies, loan growth may not return even
with economic recovery. The first six months of this year saw US companies
borrowing Dollars 216bn through the securities markets - nearly
three-quarters as much as they borrowed in the whole of 1992, a record year
for debt issuance.
Not surprisingly, a growing number of US commercial banks have been pushing
for powers to underwrite securities transactions. NationsBank recently
became only the third, after JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, to be given access
to both the debt and equity markets. Chase, Chemical and Citicorp can
underwrite only debt securities.
Starved of loan business, banks have been adding to their holdings of US
government bonds. During June these holdings averaged Dollars 701bn. This
mountain of bonds is now equal to a third of the banks' total lending. With
the US yield curve remaining steep, banks can make an easy turn sitting on
long-dated Treasuries and funding their positions with short-term money.
A sharp change in the shape of the yield curve as the recovery gathers pace
could eat into this income stream. It could also leave some banks sitting on
big capital losses - though it would be surprising if they had not hedged
part of their holdings.
So where might the next disaster to hit US banks come from? A change in the
yield curve is one possibility. Another, according to the more sceptical
observers, is the derivatives markets - one of the few areas where banks are
taking on additional credit exposure. The banking industry shrugged off such
fears in a report published by the Group of 30 last month.
The dull truth is that there may be no disaster waiting to happen - but no
big new source of profits growth either. With domestic lending suppressed,
international ambitions clipped and the US securities markets largely beyond
their ambit, income growth could be negligible.
That will put greater pressure on big banks to cut costs and, maybe, to
continue the wave of mergers which has begun to eat into the sector's
overcapacity. It may sound dull, but after the traumas of the past decade,
few bank chairmen will complain about that.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Television transmitter seeks flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Transcommunications, the privatised engineering and transmitter arm
of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority, is likely to seek a stock
market flotation next spring.
The Hampshire-based company was bought in October 1991 by Mercury Asset
Management, the fund management arm of SG Warburg, for Pounds 70m.
The beginning of January is the first permissible date for a flotation,
which would raise money partly for an acquisition.
The flotation could mean a windfall for NTL management, headed by chief
executive Mr John Forrest. About 60 per cent of the 740 staff have shares in
the company.
NTL's main business is transmitting Britain's commercial television channels
and radio stations. It is expected to have a turnover of Pounds 90m next
year and profits of around Pounds 15m.
The company has increasingly moved away from its basic activity, involving
51 high-power transmission stations and 912 local relay stations. Already 40
per cent of revenue comes from business developed since privatisation and
the company hopes this will rise to 50 per cent by next year.
One of the fastest growing areas is digital compression technology, where
the television signal is turned into digital form. The signal is then
compressed by removing unnecessary information so that a number of channels
can be carried in the space previously occupied by one.
NTL's customers include FilmNet, the European satellite television operator
which plans to run three films on a single satellite transponder. Digital
compression greatly cuts the costs of running both satellite and cable
television channels. NTL is understood to be looking for acquisitions in
digital compression.
NTL is also interested in getting into the consumer end of the market
through the development of the decoders needed to receive the compressed
signals. It is also exploring the possibility of entering, with partners,
the deregulated UK telecommunications market.
Decisions on the timing of the flotation, and on fund-raising requirements,
are likely to be taken this autumn.

FT  10 AUG 93 / BNP plans a share split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), the largest of France's state-controlled
banks, yesterday took a step towards its privatisation this autumn by
announcing plans for a two-for-one scrip issue to make its shares more
marketable.
Meanwhile, the French economics ministry said it had appointed Lazard
Freres, one of the most prominent Paris investment banks, as the government
adviser on BNP's privatisation.
The government yesterday also appointed Banque Indosuez, a subsidiary of the
Suez holding company, as its adviser for the sale of Rhone-Poulenc, the
public sector chemicals company to be privatised at the same time as BNP.
Rhone-Poulenc and BNP are the first candidates for sale in the French
privatisation drive, which is one of the most ambitious programmes in Europe
and could involve the sale over the next two years of as many as 21
state-controlled companies worth up to FFr360bn (Pounds 40bn).
BNP yesterday said that the scrip issue, whereby investors will be given two
new shares for each existing share, was intended to improve the shares'
liquidity, making them easier to trade.
The issue, which will be submitted to shareholders for approval at BNP's
next investors' meeting on September 17, will double the number of shares in
circulation by halving the nominal value of each share.
Scrip issues are becomingly more common in France, where the nominal value
of shares tends to be higher than in the US or the UK. Rhone-Poulenc last
month announced plans for a four-for-one share split as part of its strategy
of streamlining its share structure in preparation for privatisation.
LVMH, the luxury goods group, which is already publicly quoted, also
recently split its shares.
The next stage in BNP's privatisation will be the launch early next month of
the strategy devised by Mr Michel Pebereau, the French banker who was two
months ago drafted in as chairman.
Mr Pebereau, who was chief executive of the Credit Commercial de France
banking group at the time of its 1987 privatisation, has been mapping out
his strategy. He will present his proposals to BNP's staff in early
September and to shareholders at the September 17 meeting.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Tokyo stock prices rise as LDP defectors dominate new
cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the head of a seven
party-coalition, yesterday unveiled a conservative cabinet which promised to
maintain foreign and economic policies generally in line with those of the
outgoing Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Hosokawa insisted his 20-person cabinet reflected a 'new era' in
politics, citing the appointment of three women, one more than the previous
record, two people without party political affiliations, and representatives
from a range of parties, including the Social Democratic party, formerly the
Japan Socialist party. 'We should continue what should be continued and
renew what should be renewed,' Mr Hosokawa said. 'We have promised to reform
Japanese politics, and we want to fulfil the people's expectations for
change.'
However, the influence of LDP defectors, who took the leading posts of
finance, trade and industry, agriculture, defence and foreign affairs,
prompted Japanese newspapers to dub the selection the 'Ozawa cabinet' in
honour of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP powerbroker, now pulling strings
inside the coalition.
Tokyo stock prices rose after the announcement of the cabinet, which allayed
fears that the new government would confront the powerful bureaucracy over
economic policy. The new finance minister, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, is a former
Finance Ministry official.
Mr Fujii, 61, who has worked for the ministry's budget bureau, said the
government would consider new stimulatory measures for a still slowing
economy, but would not embark on a spending spree. 'We have no intention of
using deficit-covering bonds to increase spending,' he said.
The new opposition leader, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president, complained that
he could see little difference between the new government's policies and
those of the LDP, which had ruled for 38 years until last week.
'I noticed that some of the new ministers appeared to be reading from notes
prepared by bureaucrats. I think the public would have preferred them to do
some things differently,' he said.
The choice of Mr Tsutomu Hata, 57, as deputy prime minister and foreign
minister completes a circle for the man who turned down the foreign
minister's post not long before defecting from the LDP this year, saying his
priority was political reform.
The cabinet's stated policy priority is to change the electoral system
within a year.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Performance pay deal could give top civil servants 3.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP CIVIL servants could win pay increases this year averaging 3.5 per cent
 -more than double the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit -
under a performance pay arrangement offered by the Treasury.
Members of the Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA) are
currently being balloted on the offer, which affects more than 10,000 civil
servants in grades seven to five (principals to assistant secretaries).
The offer is similar to the deal agreed earlier this year with more than
100,000 white-collar civil servants.
Such deals do not formally breach the government's public sector pay ceiling
because the Treasury agreed last year that money previously used for annual
increments would in the future be used for performance-related pay.
Annual increments, which are enjoyed by a large percentage of public sector
workers, including civil servants and nurses, are excluded from the 1.5 per
cent pay limit.
However, Unison, the new 1.4m-strong public sector union, which represents
large numbers of workers who do not get an-nual increments, said it was
'inconsistent and unfair' that civil servants were treated differently from
other public sector workers.
A spokeswoman for the union, formed from a merger of the Nalgo, Nupe and
Cohse public service unions in June, said that workers such as firefighters
and ambulance workers, who are balloting on strike action in protest at the
1.5 per cent limit, had not been offered a similar deal.
Senior civil servants have been offered a 1.25 per cent increase for
inflation plus a further 2.25 per cent which in the past would have been
used for annual increments.
If the offer is accepted, government departments will be free to decide
whether to award a total of 3.5 per cent for performance or to provide a
standard increase of 1.25 per cent, with the rest used to reward
performance.
The FDA said that the total pay bill for their members would only increase
by 1.25 per cent because the increments were traditionally self fin-ancing.
The government has indicated that while there must be no 'catch-up' on
public sector pay after this year's 1.5 per cent limit, there will be a more
flexible approach in 1994-95.

FT  10 AUG 93 / A third of employers 'insist on overtime'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE THIRD of companies insist employees work overtime, according to a survey
published by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research
company.
But more than half the companies in the study said they had recently
introduced measures to restrict overtime, including shift work, extra staff
and tighter management control.
Only five of the 65 companies in the survey, however, set limits on the
amount of overtime worked by an employee. According to the survey, St Regis
Paper said it restricted overtime in one week to 28 hours, while Scottish
Amicable Life Assurance said its limit was 24 hours an employee per month.
Five out of six companies reported levels of overtime 'currently the same or
lower than last year'.
The survey found the median overtime worked was four hours a week.
Few companies have altered their methods of calculating overtime pay in the
past five years. The most common rate for overtime pay is time and a half on
weekdays and Saturday, double time on Sunday and double time plus time off
on public holidays. The rate is calculated as a fraction of a worker's
normal hourly rate and then added to the hourly rate.
Overtime pay remains predominantly a blue-collar worker phenomenon. A third
of respondents said overtime entitlements stopped at supervisory level.
London Underground, Woolwich building society and John Brown Engineering
said overtime working extended to some of their middle management.

RTZ's sale of a stake in the Lihir gold project to a little-known company at
a meagre price is curious. It may indeed be technically difficult to extract
gold from a volcanic island and politically awkward to cater to the demands
of Papua New Guinea's government. But Lihir remains one of the biggest known
gold reserves in the world. Moreover, it is hard to see what the new partner
brings to the party other than some scarcely-needed cash to help RTZ fund
the next stage and an added degree of complexity. Still, such concerns are
too peripheral to undermine RTZ's share price progress more than
momentarily.

Following last week's announcement of an imminent order from Kuwait comes
this week's announcement of the imminent signing of a contract on an order
from Kuwait. GKN seems to be learning quickly the excellent defence trick of
unveiling the same deal several times. And in traditional defence style the
size and value of the order are state secrets and may remain so even when
contracts are finally signed.
Still, it is possible to discern something through the fog. The Kuwaiti
order for Warriors will dovetail nicely with the ending of the production
run for the British Army in 1994. Given that plant and development costs
will have been written down margins on the Kuwaiti order should be good, and
there may well be an additional order for Piranha wheeled vehicles later.
All of which suggests that while GKN's current rating looks demanding, those
prepared to look out to 1995 can see solid value.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that early summer sales in June had tempted shoppers and produced
stronger retail sales figures, it is hardly surprising that consumer credit
also grew during the month. Indeed, the strength of credit card advances
reinforces the idea that bargain hunters are prepared to buy when prices are
right. Whether the trend will continue once the sales end will be the real
test of consumer confidence. Yet unless the picture deteriorates badly,
there is little pressure for an interest rate cut to bolster growth. Nor is
there a need to offset an appreciation of the pound, since sterling's
trade-weighted index has fallen over the past two weeks.
So short gilts weakened yesterday as the prospect of interest rate cuts
receded, while the long end of the market took heart from the fact that
inflationary pressures remain weak. The recent powerful rally has not been
slowed by the supply of new issues, even though the government is well ahead
with this year's funding programme. Banks, overseas buyers and retail
investors seem happy to support the market, especially with the prospect of
lower interest rates in the autumn to counter any fiscal tightening in the
November budget. Any sign of renewed inflation would, however, undermine
that complacency.

per cent emphasises the government's continued adherence to the ancien
regime. The government now appears to confront two options with only one
outcome: either it cuts interest rates and the franc depreciates as returns
on holding the currency decline; or it does not cut interest rates and the
franc depreciates because investors worry about the damage to the underlying
economy.
Over the short term, the government may persist with high rates to replenish
its depleted foreign reserves. But the reluctance to cut perhaps also
reflects the government's psychological shock. French politicians have no
recent experience of managing a floating franc. Mr Balladur now needs to
invent a new policy. Politically, it would be acutely embarrassing for him
to allow the franc to fall sharply.
Overseas investors who have already bid up the Paris equity and bond markets
are taking substantial interest rate cuts for granted and may grow queasy
about delay. But interest rates are only a part of the equation. A lower
cost of borrowing may boost corporate profits but will have little effect on
consumers worried about jobs. With unemployment at 11.6 per cent and rising,
French demand may remain weak for longer than the equity market fondly
imagines.

FT  10 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Hard currency choices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange that the government should revive its proposal for a hard Ecu while
the exchange rate mechanism is in disarray. As chancellor and prime
minister, Mr Major in the past championed the cause of a common European
currency when faced with the less palatable alternative of a single
currency. Since Mr Kohl, the German chancellor, believes that the divergence
of European economies has put back monetary union by at least two years,
that threat appears to have receded. More likely, then, Mr Major sees an
opportunity to fill the political vacuum while other European governments
wonder what to do next.
But even if the drive towards a single currency has been derailed, sceptics
will not be easily convinced that the creation of a thirteenth European
currency is a credible alternative. The Bundesbank is notably opposed to the
creation of a parallel currency and monetary institutions. Monetary hawks
elsewhere are no less suspicious of a plan which might distort money supply.
Exactly how the proposed European Monetary Institute would set hard Ecu
interest rates and control the stock of money remain open to question. It is
hard to believe that Euro-sceptics within the Conservative party will be any
more tolerant of a common currency than a single currency. The bruising
ratification of the Maastricht treaty can not have helped bring them on
side.
On that basis the hard Ecu looks no more likely to win friends than it did
two years ago. True, such a common unit of account would bring savings for
business in cross border transactions. But while some European governments
still have their sights set on the higher goal of monetary union, the
proposal looks little more than a sideshow.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Third of employers insist on overtime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE THIRD of companies insist employees should work overtime, according to a
survey published by Industrial Relations Services.
But more than half the companies in the study said they had recently
introduced measures to restrict overtime, including shift work, extra staff
and tighter management control. However, only five of the 65 companies in
the survey set limits on the amount of overtime worked by an employee. The
amount of overtime being worked was similar to last year, with five out of
six companies reporting levels of overtime 'currently the same or lower than
last year'.
According to the survey, St Regis Paper said it restricted overtime in one
week to 28 hours, while Scottish Amicable Life Assurance said it limited
overtime to 24 hours a month.
Suttons Seeds said overtime in the company had to be approved by the
directors. Calor Gas and PPG Industries (glass fibre division) said they
employed temporary or contract staff as a way of reducing dependence on
overtime.
Both PLM Redfearn, a packaging company, and Premier Fabrics said they had
recruited more staff to cut overtime.
Few companies have altered their methods of calculating overtime pay in the
past five years, with little difference between manufacturing and service
sectors. The most common rate for overtime pay is time and a half on
weekdays and Saturday, double time on Sunday and double time plus time off
on public holidays.
The overtime rate is calculated as a fraction of a worker's normal hourly
rate and then added to the hourly rate. The median overtime hours worked in
the survey amounted to four a week but on average 20 extra hours were worked
at Tate and Lyle.
Overtime pay remains predominantly a blue-collar worker phenomenon. A third
of respondents said overtime entitlements stopped at supervisory level while
another third used the lower level of management as the cut-off point.
London Underground, Woolwich building society and John Brown Engineering
said overtime working extended to at least some of their middle management.

FT  10 AUG 93 / The struggle of the dispossessed: Michael Skapinker examines
a Polish woman's fight to win back property confiscated by the Nazis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In her central Paris apartment, Mrs Ewa Szpicberg sits composing letters to
finance ministers, company chairmen and bankers, demanding support in her
battle against the occupiers of her land in the Polish port of Gdansk.
Her principal targets are Saur, the French water company, and Orbis, the
Polish state tourist organisation, which, she alleges, operate on land
confiscated from her family by the Nazis in 1939. There are, in her eyes,
other villains too. Chief among them is the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, which is considering funding further Saur projects. in
Gdansk.
For Mrs Szpicberg, a 70-year-old Jewish grandmother, the emotionally charged
letters in English, French and Polish are an attempt to gain one small
victory on behalf of her younger brother, Marek, and other family members
who died in the Holocaust.
To the recipients of her letters, her struggle highlights the hazards of
doing business in eastern Europe. Property owners and their heirs,
dispossessed by the Nazi or communist authorities, can emerge to upset the
most carefully considered investment plans.
Mrs Szpicberg's campaign began in January last year when she saw a small
item in a US news magazine quoting a Polish official who said the country
would return property confiscated from Jews during the second world war.
She asked Mr Jerzy Lipski, a Gdansk lawyer, to investigate what had happened
to two properties that her father, a Warsaw timber merchant, had purchased
in 1922.
Mrs Szpicberg and her brother inherited the Gdansk properties when her
father died nine years after he acquired them. As the site of two apartment
blocks, the properties provided the family with a rental income until the
war.
With the Nazi occupation of Poland, the Szpicbergs were split up. Mrs
Szpicberg and her mother evaded capture by posing as non-Jews in different
parts of Poland. Marek died in the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943. After the
war, Mrs Szpicberg made her way to Paris, where she was reunited with her
mother.
Mrs Szpicberg has never returned to Poland. It did not occur to her to
reclaim the land until she saw the US magazine article.
Mr Lipski reported that the apartment blocks were gone. The properties had
been nationalised after the war.
The first property, a 136 sq m site, was now covered by part of the
high-rise Hevelius hotel, operated by Orbis, which had acquired a lease on
the site in perpetuity from the Gdansk provincial government.
The second property, covering 333 sq m, was now owned by the city of Gdansk
and formed part of the local waterworks.
It was the discovery that the city of Gdansk was busily attracting foreign
finance to upgrade its water system that set Mrs Szpicberg off on her
letter-writing campaign. Why should foreign companies profit from land
confiscated by the Nazis, she asked. And shouldn't guests at the Hevelius be
aware of the history of some of the land under the hotel?
At the beginning of last year, Gdansk transferred the management of its
drinking water and purification system to a company controlled by Saur, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Bouygues, the French construction and engineering
giant. Saur was granted a 51 per cent stake in a company called Saur Neptun
Gdansk, which had the right to operate the water system for 30 years. The
remaining stake was held by the city of Gdansk.
Mrs Szpicberg accepts that it would be impractical for the water company to
return her land. Her aim is to receive compensation.
She wrote to the city authorities, telling them that part of the joint
venture's facilities were on her land. The city brushed aside her request
for compensation. Ms Maria Malkowska, a member of the Gdansk city governing
board, says there is no prospect of the municipality meeting Mrs Szpicberg's
demands. She says: 'We are simply not considering such claims.'
Mrs Szpicberg wrote twice to Bouygues. Last November she received a reply
from Mr Bernard Devalan, Saur's director general, saying she should go back
to Gdansk municipality, the only authority competent to deal with her claim.
Mr Jacques Sennepin, Saur's deputy managing director and the head of the
company's foreign operations, says: 'It's an awful case. Unfortunately,
there are many cases like this. But we have no power to do anything.'
Last December, Mrs Szpicberg read in Les Echos, the French newspaper, that
the EBRD and a group of Scandinavian companies and government organisations
were planning to help finance the upgrading of Saur Neptun's water
purification system.
Over the next seven months she wrote six increasingly fraught letters to Mr
Jacques Attali, then the bank's president, asking how the EBRD could fund a
company in possession of land confiscated by the Nazis. She asked him to
withhold bank money until Saur Neptun had settled with her.
Mr Attali replied twice. His tone was sympathetic but his message was clear:
the bank could do nothing. He wrote: 'I understand the sentiments which
drive you . . . I would particularly like to avoid answering so personal
letter as yours with the coldness of a bureaucratic response.
'However, the financial participation of the bank in the reconstruction of
the water purification system of Gdansk does not permit it to intervene on
your behalf with the municipality, the only body competent to settle your
dispute.'
The EBRD says that the replies to Mrs Szpicberg from Mr Attali, who resigned
earlier last month after criticism of lavish spending at the bank, remain
its policy.
Mr Josue Tanaka, deputy director of the bank's infrastructure department,
says he does not think the project, an Ecu68m investment in waste-water
collection and treatment, was on Mrs Szpicberg's land. He says the bank's
legal advisers said it could take no action on Mrs Szpicberg's behalf. This
is because its funds would go to a company set up to finance the project
rather than to the operating company.
Mr Tanaka expects the bank to finance 20 per cent of the cost of the
project. Other investors are expected to be Saur, the Gdansk local
authorities and a group of Scandinavian investors headed by the Kruger
Group, the Danish environmental protection and energy company. Kruger wrote
to Mrs Szpicberg last April saying it could not help her, as the company's
involvement in the project would not give it any control over her property.
The other Scandinavian investors are expected to be the Nordic Environment
Finance Corporation, which is funded by the governments of Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Iceland and Finland, and two Danish government bodies. The three
organisations say they cannot comment on Mrs Szpicberg's case.
Mrs Szpicberg wrote five times to Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister and former chairman of the EBRD board of governors. Yesterday she
received a reply from Mr Waigel, saying that while he regretted what had
happened to her family under the Nazis, he was no longer chairman of the
EBRD governors and was unable to help her.
Mrs Szpicberg dismisses the argument of the EBRD and its fellow-investors.
She argues that, as the bank's founding agreement commits it to respect
human rights, it should not provide funds to a company in possession of land
acquired as a result of earlier human rights violations.
She has made some progress with Orbis. Earlier this year she wrote to Mr
Paul Dubrule, chairman of Accor, the French hotel group, asking for his
help. Accor has no connection with the Hevelius. Orbis, however, runs six
hotels in Poland under franchise from Accor. Accor also runs a small tourist
company in Paris jointly with Orbis.
Mr Dubrule instructed some of his senior executives to see what they could
do. Last April, Mr Michael Flaxman, the regional director responsible for
Poland, wrote to Orbis saying Accor hoped a solution could be found. On May
4, Mr Lipski was told by Orbis that the organisation hoped to present
proposals for a settlement in two weeks. Orbis has still not presented its
proposals.
Ms Maria Warchol, Orbis's legal counsel in Gdansk, says the organisation 'is
conducting an investigation which would clarify the exact legal position as
to the status of the land'. Ms Katarzyna Gontarczyk, the organisation's
spokeswoman in Warsaw, confirms that Orbis hopes shortly to reach a solution
acceptable to both sides.

POTENTIALLY the most valuable innovation of last week's report by Sir Ron
Dearing on the national curriculum in England and Wales was the announcement
that he is to consult until the end of the year on changes to education from
the ages of 14 to 19. His big idea is that the age 16 need not have any
great educational significance. In the UK's main competitor countries, after
all, 14 is more important. At this point, children embark on courses which
are designed to keep them in full-time education until the age of 18 or 19.
This runs against the traditional British educational culture, where 16 is
regarded as the standard leaving age, and academic A-levels are the
educational 'gold standard'. But disquieting international comparisons
released last week by the Department for Education suggest that Britain's
focus on academic education to the age of 16 encourages children to leave
school early. In 1990, only 40 per cent of the UK's 16-18-year-olds stayed
in full-time education. This was the lowest figure for any of the countries
surveyed: the German rate was 89 per cent.
In other European countries, national curriculums are narrow and their
purpose is to ensure that all children study at least a core of essential
academic subjects. Some will add to that core academic subjects for a career
in higher education. But others will concentrate, without any feeling of
stigma, on vocational education.
Unfortunately, the national curriculum in England and Wales has had exactly
the opposite effect. It accounts for too much of pupils' time to allow
worthwhile vocational courses. Technology covers several technical
disciplines, and does not allow children to develop specific skills.
Britain's problem seems to be that it does not motivate children, who by 14
have already lost any interest in academic subjects. A programme of
vocational education could give them extra confidence, along with worthwhile
skills and work habits.
The government has made several changes to vocational education. General
National Vocational Qualifications are now to be called 'vocational
A-levels' and are proving popular with 16-year-olds. Further education has
been released from local education authorities, and has been given extra
funds for expansion.
But the changes have lacked focus, and what is most needed is a change in
culture. Reform of vocational education need not be a controversial matter.
It has steadfast backing from employers, and enjoys the support of teachers'
unions, and of the Labour Party. High unemployment has also helped the
chances of engineering a cultural change. With limited job opportunities
available, youngsters are getting into the habit of staying in full-time
education for longer. If the right courses are introduced, they might
continue to do so even when the job market is buoyant once more. The
opportunity is there to be grasped.

Self help and the elimination of red tape is something you come to expect
from an organisation representing the best of British business. So visitors
to the CBI's Centre Point headquarters should not be surprised to find that
instead of having to spell out their name and company ever so slowly to the
receptionist they are now required to punch in their details on a small
keyboard at the front desk. The information is printed out onto a visitors'
ticket which the receptionist folds into a plastic lapel badge.
Observer passed the key-board test, of course, but is not so sure that those
CBI members who are used to minions hitting the keys will take as kindly to
the idea. After all, where is the personal service?

Still on the subject of cricket, has anyone seen Barry Flanagan's odd statue
which has just been removed from under the nose of the Bank of England?
It was supposed to be a cricketer but a Financial Times reader rang to
complain that it was more like a kangaroo sitting on top of some cricket
stumps. Hardly the sort of work that should be supported by a nationalised
industry, complained one reader, especially when England was receiving such
a pasting at the hands of the Aussies.
However, when Observer went to inspect the offending exhibit, which was part
of the Art in the City project, it had disappeared. Had Eddie George, the
new governor of the Bank of England, eradicated the last traces of his
cricketing-mad predecessor? No such luck. The Bank of England is just as
much in the dark as the sculpture's owner, Waddington gallery, as to the
cricketer's current whereabouts. Let's hope the Australians haven't
kidnapped it.

Ted Dexter, finally bowled out as chairman of England's cricket selectors,
should have known his innings was up when the latest Information Technology
Review added its weight to the growing criticism of English cricket.
It was up to London University computing professor John Campbell,
stone-walling against unrealistic claims about the possibilities of
artificial intelligence, to state the obvious.
'It may be possible to build a cricket-playing robot, but we don't think
that we can equip it with the knowledge and batting skills of Don Bradman,'
Campbell says, before adding: 'though building something with just the
competence of an average member of the present English national cricket team
may be another matter.'

When you have been managing director of Coutts &amp; Co, private bankers to the
royal family, what do you do for an encore?
Julian Robarts, who spent 34 years in a Coutts' frock coat, has found
another family to serve, albeit one with rather less money. He has recently
taken over as chief executive of The Iveagh Trustees, which manages what's
left of the fortune of the brewing side of the far flung Guinness family.
The family stake in Guinness is now down to around 2 per cent. But this is
still worth close to Pounds 200m.
Robarts, whose family bank had been taken over by Coutts in 1914, parted
company with Coutts after its parent National Westminster Bank decided to
put one of its own men in charge at the end of 1991. Having had a year off
enjoying himself, Robarts decided that 56 was too young to retire from City
life.
Discreet as ever, Robarts refuses to say much about his new post, save to
admit that it is a full-time job. Indeed, the appointment would probably
have gone unpublicised had it not been for the fact that Robarts has also
taken on the chairmanship of Hill Martin, a small Bristol firm which looks
after the finances of wealthy clients.

So you want to get your throne back? Deposed monarchs the world over will be
watching with interest the surprise visit to Greece by former King
Constantine and his family.
The king, who lost his throne in 1967, has stooped to employing a big
international public relations company to publicise the symbolism of his
return. Judging by the good turn-out for the recent funeral of King Baudouin
of the Belgians, the royalty business is doing rather well at the moment and
if an ex-king is to make a come-back now is as good a time as any.
Burson-Marsteller, which employs some of the world's top spin doctors, has
been primed to supply media-friendly answers to the most obvious questions
about the ex-king's return to Greece. Hence, the only official significance
of the timing of the visit is that it coincides with some of the king's
children finishing university and other teaching jobs. As to who is paying
for the expedition, all B-M is prepared to disclose is that the royal family
are on board a motorboat chartered from a Greek company through a British
brokerage firm and are guests of the Prince of Hanover.
No mention of the wealthy Greek shipping families who frequent the king's
off-shore court in London's Hampstead and would dearly love a return of
their monarch. Nor for that matter is there any mention that Constantine is
returning to Greece when the government is looking particularly wobbly. If
B-M does a good job for Constantine there could be plenty more out-of-work
monarchs knocking on its door.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Soft on the hard Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH proposal for a hard Ecu, originally put forward by Mr John Major
when chancellor in 1990, was not without its merits. But whether it will
become more than a marginal talking point again in the aftermath of the
near-terminal upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism seems altogether
questionable.
The case for a parallel currency which would never depreciate against any
existing currency within the ERM was originally made in the context of a
very powerful impetus towards economic and monetary union. While the
Maastricht timetable for Emu remains theoretically intact, monetary union
inevitably looks more remote after recent events. The D-Mark - a softer
option than the hard Ecu - has anyway proved too much even for the franc
fort. In short, the problems of the EC after Maastricht are not ones to
which the hard Ecu looks relevant. The important thing now is to ensure that
Europe gets its larger priorities right.
The first essential is to absorb the message implicit in the ERM's loss of
credibility in the markets. The pressure on the system came mainly from the
idea that the attempt on the part of France and other countries to retain a
fixed relationship with the D-Mark in the period of German unification was
doomed to failure. With Germany running a combination of tight monetary
policy and lax fiscal policy, the ERM became a mechanism for transmitting a
needless recession across Europe. Macro-economic stringency was thus added
to the micro problems of Europe's over-rigid labour markets. The resulting
upward pressure on unemployment numbers raised doubts about the political
commitment to a hard ERM, notably in France.
On this the markets judged better than the politicians. And in seeking to
establish what can be salvaged, it is important to recognise that the level
of interest rates appropriate for the German economy is unlikely to make
sense for much of the rest of Europe for some time to come. It follows that
any response to the ERM debacle that involves the French government in
seeking a swift dash for monetary union would simply compound the damage. It
would also perpetuate the chief political error in the Maastricht process,
whereby the integrationist instincts of Europe's political elite ran far
ahead of public opinion.
It seems unlikely that such a move would anyway appeal to Germany, where
opinion polls suggest considerable hostility to the loss of the D-Mark. Nor
will an early narrowing the ERM bands amount to much more than an invitation
to market participants to test the resolve of the central banks once again.
The more pressing need is for some wider rebalancing of economic policy. A
more responsible German fiscal policy will no doubt take time. But the Bank
of France's decision yesterday to cut short-term rates by a quarter of a
point was a modest but useful step in a sensible direction: a lot more of
the same is required.

<TEXT>
WITH THE UK recession now over, British companies seem to have come through
it in remarkably good shape. The profitability of those which have survived
is much higher than at the end of the last recession. Their investment is
holding up, as is their capacity utilisation. Despite higher margins, they
remain more competitive in world markets than a decade ago. With a recovery
under way, might it not be plain sailing from now on?
Perhaps, but not necessarily. As the latest Bank of England Quarterly
Bulletin suggests, the most significant change in British commercial life
over the past decade has been in the relations between employer and
employee. The driving force behind higher margins has been rising
productivity, combined - latterly - with surprising wage restraint. But the
implied shift in the balance of power between labour and capital cannot be
unconnected with the endemic rise in unemployment over the past decade, and
its future direction is uncertain.
Granted, the shift has benefited workers and shareholders alike. As the
Bulletin reminds us, the share of profits paid out in dividends doubled
during the 1980s. This did not stop the real wages of UK workers rising
rapidly in the same period: the losers were those whose jobs were sacrificed
in the cause of higher productivity.
But the rise in dividends also meant that retained profits - that is,
profits available for re-investment - were no higher in relation to GDP in
this recession than in the last. Though investment was higher, it was funded
by debt: a fact which may have made companies more conservative.
Moreover, the rise in UK profitability over the decade owes much to the more
recent inclusion of the privatised utilities. Exclude those, and the
remaining companies which make up Britain's shrunken export-orientated
manufacturing industry still make a meagre return by international
standards. But unless more capital can be attracted to the traded goods
sector, Britain is unlikely to correct its trade deficit. And unless
manufacturers can make higher returns, they cannot keep both workers and
shareholders happy and have profits left to reinvest.
Whether the outcome is the rosy scenario - a sustained rise in export
margins - will depend on how the government and wage-bargainers react to
recovery. The UK government has staked the remnants of its credibility on
its inflation record. The news that UK factory gate prices rose last month
by 4.1 per cent may sound unsettling in a supposed low-inflation
environment.
If companies are to improve their margins, they must be allowed to raise
their prices faster than their costs. At present, the devaluation of
sterling gives British industry that opportunity. But if the government
takes fright and seeks to push sterling up, or if wage-bargainers try to
offset higher prices with higher wages, then it will not be plain sailing.

FT  10 AUG 93 / High stakes in title fight: Competing claims for land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unravelling title to land and property is not easy in a country with a past
like Poland's.
It was occupied by the Germans in 1939. Then, in a 1945 deal between Stalin
and the western powers, its eastern and western boundaries were shifted
200km west, as it was given a large tract of former eastern Germany in
compensation for a 200km swathe of eastern Poland which was integrated into
the former Soviet Union.
During the war, the Nazis had already confiscated large numbers of buildings
and private estates. In the years that followed, the communist regime
continued the process, nationalising almost all the privately owned land in
Poland.
As in the rest of eastern Europe, the collapse of communism in Poland in the
1980s has meant the revival of the property issue. Growing numbers of former
owners and their heirs have demanded the return of their property, whether
it be land, factories, apartment blocks, houses or water mills.
The Polish government has been struggling to clarify and define the issues
involved in a restitution bill, designed to combine the interests of tens of
thousands of claimants with the rights of those who have been using their
property for decades.
For example, 2.7m hectares of land were confiscated from landowners after
the second world war. Of these, 1.7m hectares were distributed to peasant
farmers, who still hold the land. The 3,000-strong former landowners'
association says it only wants back land still held by the state.
In addition, 16,500 country houses, large and small, were confiscated. Only
200 remain habitable, largely because they were developed as schools,
conference centres or state farm headquarters.
If there is consensus on anything, it is that the issue must be resolved.
Without a restitution law, 'foreign and domestic investment and
privatisation remain impeded', says Nabarro Nathanson, the UK law firm, in
its study of the latest draft version of the bill.
Mr Maciej Raczkiewicz of Epstein Engineering, a US company operating in
Warsaw, agrees up to a point. 'It's a problem but not an overwhelming one,'
he says. 'Getting building permits out of the city bureaucracy causes more
of a headache.'
Developers who have faced repeated problems getting finance for their
buildings have blamed the delay on difficulties in clarifying land title.
But it is at least partly caused by an overloaded and inefficient
bureaucracy.
Indeed, over the past three years, western investors buying into Polish
enterprises have shown scant regard for the claims of former owners,
trusting government assurances that they would be compensated when the
restitution law was passed.
The Swarzedz furniture factory in northern Poland was one of the first state
companies to be privatised. When it was sold in a public share offer in
1991, the government held back 5 per cent of the equity to compensate for
the claims of two former owners who came forward.
PepsiCo Foods International, which bought control of the Warsaw-based Wedel
chocolate company in 1991, ignored the fact that Mr Karol Whitehead, an heir
of the former owner, had been trying for the past year to persuade the
government to recognise his well-documented claim to the factory.
'The heirs of the owners of E Wedel hold to this day all the prewar shares
of this company,' says Mr Whitehead.
Legally, however, wherever property was taken over in accord with communist
nationalisation decrees of 1945 and 1946, it remains the property of the
state until a restitution law is passed. Wherever a former owner can prove
that the nationalisation decrees were violated, property has been restored.
The draft law, which had started its passage through parliament before it
was dissolved at the end of May, provides for three forms of compensation.
These are: the return of the property in question; where that is impossible,
'equivalent' property; and third, compensation in the form of privatisation
coupons, which could be used to buy shares in privatised assets.
These provisions would apply only to Polish citizens domiciled in the
country at the time the law came into force, and not to the large number of
Polish people still living in exile.
The government is considering the creation of a 'reprivatisation reserve',
which would consist of 5 per cent of the equity in majority state-owned
joint stock companies and which would provide for the means to compensate
for property that cannot be physically restored.
However, with the outcome of elections on September 19 uncertain, no one
knows when the restitution law will be passed. Meanwhile, a senior official
in the privatisation ministry says of land that belongs to the Treasury
under the postwar decrees: 'At the moment there is no law which would permit
us to give this land back. When one is passed, then we will be able to do
something. Until then our hands are tied.'

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances as new
cabinet takes up office
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices firmed as the new cabinet of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa was
appointed, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 135.11 to 20,493.05 as a rise in the futures market
prompted arbitrage related buying. It opened at the day's low of 20,339.83
and rose to a high of 20,553.06 during the morning session. Volume remained
flat at 190m shares against 191m. Investment trusts supported prices, while
foreign investors were also seen small-lot buying.
Advances led declines by 552 to 378, with 214 issues remaining unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.42 to 1,659.01. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.07 to 1,262.89.
Hopes grew of a discount rate cut to bolster the economy. Market
participants interpreted comments by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance
minister, denying the possibility of a government bond issue to cover a
revenue shortage, as an indication that the new government will try to
stimulate the economy through monetary measures.
High-technology issues were higher on hopes that the new government will
allocate public spending to telecommunication infrastructure projects and
computers for education.
Sharp, the most active issue of the day, rose Y10 to Y1,400 and Matsushita
Electric Industrial gained Y30 to Y1,380. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
advanced Y11,000 to Y927,000.
Reports that Fuji Oil, a palm oil manufacturer, had discovered a substitute
for natural oil, encouraged investors, pushing the issue up Y46 to Y1,040.
Takasago International, an aromatic chemical maker which supplies flagrances
for Japan Tobacco, the state owned tobacco company, rose on JT's listing
early next year. However, it later fell on profit-taking, closing down Y15
to Y880.
Higher property sales and hopes of lower interest rates supported real
estate companies. Mitsui Fudosan rose Y20 to Y1,310 and Mitsubishi Estate
gained Y10 to Y1,080.
Nippon Kayaku, a chemical maker, rose Y17 to Y910. The company expects to
raise its production of epoxy resin due to the explosion at Sumitomo
Chemical's plant last month.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 56.96 to 22,352.06 in volume of 8.6m shares.
Roundup
Profit-taking was a feature in a number of Pacific Rim markets. Singapore
and Bombay were closed for public holidays.
NEW ZEALAND closed at its highest level since July 1990, powered by an 8
cent gain in Telecom to NZDollars 4.10.
The NZSE-40 capital index rose 7.64 to 1,903.64, in turnover of NZDollars
40.1m, high for a Monday but about half last week's daily average.
AUSTRALIA edged higher as gold bullion prices picked up and the All
Ordinaries index rose 2.1 to 1,844.3 in turnover of ADollars 345.9m.
News Corp was a star performer, rising 23 cents to a record Australian
Dollars 8.88 in the wake of strong demand in New York on Friday. Foodland
rose 20 cents to ADollars 8.80 after a day's high of ADollars 9 on news of a
possible merger.
Heavy fallers included the building and sugar products group, CSR, which
tumbled 31 cents to ADollars 4.19 after sinking to ADollars 4.01. A US court
awarded USDollars 2m against the company last week for distributing products
containing asbestos.
TAIWAN closed higher, but profit-taking as the weighted index edged above
4,100 pulled prices off their peak. The index ended 66.09 ahead at 4,092.73,
after a peak of 4,109.10, as turnover climbed to TDollars 20.3bn.
Buying was fuelled by news the Bank of Tawan cut its prime lending rate to
7.875 percent.
HONG KONG was unable to sustain strong early gains which took the Hang Seng
index 101 points higher and profit-taking left the index 14.55 lower at
7,382.22 as turnover shrank to HKDollars 4.41bn.
MANILA was sharply lower at the start of an anticipated consolidation and
the composite index dropped 28.18 to 1,715.79. PLDT dropped 10 pesos to
1,085 pesos but the newly-listed JG Summit Holdings closed at 6 pesos after
an opening high of 6.50 pesos which compared with its offer price of 4.40
pesos.
SEOUL was lower for the third consecutive session in lethargic trade which
saw the composite shed 7.29 at 709.59.
BANGKOK gave way to what was seen as overdue profit-taking after the rally
of the previous eight sessions and the SET index dipped 6.07 to 952.77 in
heavy turnover of Bt9.89bn.

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at record high after
budget victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices surged to record highs yesterday after bond yields dropped
sharply in reaction to President Clinton's budget victory, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.65 at 3,576.08,
above its previous record close of 3,567.42 but below its highs for the day.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.03 at 450.71, while
the Amex composite finished 2.46 higher at 438.80, and the Nasdaq composite
up 0.41 at 718.49, a new all-time high. Trading volume on the NYSE was 232m
shares.
Prices opened firmer, but did not post strong gains until mid-morning when
the bond market's latest rally took hold. Bond prices rose sharply, and sent
the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue below 6.5 per cent for the first
time, as fixed-income investors applauded the Senate's approval last Friday
of President Clinton's deficit-reduction package.
The bond rally surprised dealers and investors, who did not expect much
reaction to the Senate vote because approval of the budget had already been
priced into Treasuries. The big drop in yields, however, was welcomed by the
stock markets, and with computerised program buying adding to the upward
momentum, prices raced to new highs just before midday.
Among individual stocks, interest rate-sensitive issues in the financials
sector fared well, with brokerage companies leading the way. Salomon climbed
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 , Merrill Lynch added Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 89 1/4 , Primerica rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 , Morgan
Stanley firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 73 1/8 and Bear Stearns put on
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 24 3/8 .
Motor company stocks were in demand. The sector has been in favour recently
following strong quarterly earnings reports, but last Friday it ran into
profit-taking, suffering heavy losses. Yesterday, the sector rallied, with
General Motors adding Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 49, Ford putting on Dollars
5/8 at Dollars 52 1/4 and Chrysler climbing Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/4
. Selected drug stocks weakened following downgrades from the investment
bank, Lehman Brothers. Schering-Plough fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 3/8 ,
Johnson &amp; Johnson dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 and Bristol-Myers
Squibb gave up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 51 5/8 .
Eastman Kodak continued to rally in the wake of last week's ousting of its
chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore, rising another Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 1/4
after the National Security Agency suspended a Dollars 200m workstation
contract with the company after competitors said that the machine's
performance was misrepresented.
Canada
TORONTO closed higher, led by recovering gold stocks. The composite index
rose 42.24 to close at 4,002.20 in turnover of CDollars 510.3m. Advances led
declines by 390 to 292. Volume was 42.8m shares.
The gold sub-index rose 4.5 per cent as the gold price rebounded from last
week's fall. Ten of the other 13 sub-indexes also closed higher.
Among gold stocks, Franco-Nevada soared CDollars 3 5/8 to CDollars 71 5/8 ,
American Barrick jumped CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 33 1/8 , and Placer Dome
gained CDollars 1 to CDollars 26 3/8 .

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Voices raised against Frankfurt revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global equity markets were peppered with big gains last week. In Europe,
Germany outstripped France after being left sadly behind seven days before.
In the previous week, the lack of a discount rate cut left Frankfurt down
while Paris climbed on the prospect of an effective franc devaluation.
However, an unexpected cut in the Buba repo rate followed last Tuesday, and
Germany extended its 1993 gains to an above-average 20.7 per cent.
Voices continue to be raised against this trend. Nikko Securities, a
longstanding bear of the Frankfurt market, said that it expected the German
economy to be very weak for the next two years: ' . . . on that basis,' it
maintained, that 'the equity market is fundamentally overvalued at over 24
times earnings.'
Lehman Brothers said that evidence since the mid-1950s would suggest that
French equities are more responsive to easier money than those in Germany.
'In the past 30 years,' it said, 'there have been four general periods when
German equities have been overvalued relative to French equities, and we are
in the fourth phase at present.'
On the Pacific Rim, New Zealand had another good week, particularly last
Thursday after a cut in taxes on foreign portfolio investors. Hong Kong did
even better after better than expected results from HSBC's Midland Bank.
Last week's global equity charts illustrate just how heavily the biggest
markets, in the US and in Japan, weigh upon the world. There were some big
gains in continental Europe, and bigger yet in a number of Asian countries,
taking the FT-Actuaries Europe ex UK, and Pacific ex Japan indices to rises
of 2.5, and 3.2 per cent respectively in local currency terms; but the World
Index managed a gain of only 0.5 per cent.
Unfortunately, Wall Street was subdued again, first in advance of the House
of Representatives vote on President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction
package on Thursday night, and then on Friday's late vote to ensure that Mr
Clinton's budget bill would pass through Congress. US equities rose by only
0.1 per cent on the week, maintaining a fairly flat trajectory; Japan, on
the other hand, registered a 0.3 per cent decline after an ebullient month,
and quarter, as investors waited for political haggling to end in Tokyo.
The US, to a degree, was affected by the drop in the gold price after first,
bullion hit Dollars 400 and, secondly, the ERM crisis appeared to be
resolved. Australia and Canada were also pulled back, but the obvious loser
was South Africa which showed falls on the week of 4.2 per cent in local
currency terms, and 7.7 per cent in terms of the dollar.
Specialist brokers in London said that big selling of gold from China,
through Hong Kong put the first bite on the market, which weakened further
on a massive reduction in long gold positions on the Comex market; they
added that there was related pressure on the financial rand.

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Movement in sectors as bourses
consolidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECTOR selection, consolidation and profit-taking after last week's gains
were among yesterday's themes, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw some action in banks ahead of today's half-year results from
Dresdner, but the DAX index closed only 2.92 higher at 1,872.30. Turnover
fell from DM9.5bn to DM7.5bn from Friday's DM9.5bn. Dresdner rose DM5 to
DM419.50 on expectations of a 10 to 12 per cent rise in first-half operating
profits after risk provisions, and Deutsche Bank closed DM8.90 higher at
DM781.90.
There was a sceptical response to Friday's Volkswagen prediction of a profit
in 1993; the shares fell DM2.80 to DM371.20. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck
in Dusseldorf noted that VW was the worst performing DAX constituent in
July, with a fall of 4 per cent, but still the best performer for the first
seven months of 1993 with a 43.7 per cent gain.
DUBLIN put on an afternoon spurt as investors bought into Allied Irish
Banks, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life ahead of AIB's half year results
today.
The ISEQ overall index rose 27.40, or 1.6 per cent to 1,719.04. Financials
were 1.8 per cent ahead with AIB 7p higher at 292p and BoI up 6p at 261p.
AMSTERDAM continued to attract solid foreign demand and the CBS Tendency
general index rose 0.50 to 123.90.
Among cyclicals, Hoogovens rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 48.20 after touching a 1993
intraday high of Fl 49.30. The shares have doubled since January on hopes
for a profit recovery from 1995, and added 27 per cent in the last month
alone, aided by covering of short positions of more than 1.3m shares.
BRUSSELS edged ahead with the Bel-20 index 0.45 higher at 1,343.14 in low
turnover of BFr1.02bn.
Steel stocks, increasingly viewed as a good recovery play, were again in
demand. Cockerill Sambre reached BFr139 before profit-taking left it just
BFr1 higher at BFr134 in heavy volume of 622,000 shares. Arbed, the
Luxembourg steel group, rose BFr140 or 3.4 per cent to BFr4,275.
MILAN put in a strong performance in heavy volume, with the market again led
by the strength of the telecommunications sector. The Comit index rose 8.83
to 590.31.
Sip gained L66 to L3,415.5 in volume of 24.3m shares while Stet slipped L23
to L4,131 in 8.31m shares. Italcable rose L731 or 8.7 per cent to L9,146
following the government plans to merge it with Sip.
Olivetti rose on renewed speculative hopes it could gain from the end of
Sip's monopoly in mobile phones. The stock ended L84 lire up at L1,960.
PARIS consolidated in gentle profit-taking after Friday's record close, the
CAC-40 index falling 11.31 to 2,138.52 in turnover down from FFr5.2bn to
FFr3.15bn.
Cyclicals inched up, Michelin rising FFr3.30 to FFr191.40 and Peugeot by
FFr7 to FFr687. The building materials supplier, Lafarge-Coppee, also bucked
the market trend with a gain of FFr11.50 to FFr456. and FFr2 to FFr.
Alcatel fell FFr8 to FFr690 after a 3.7 per cent fall in first half sales at
Alcatel Cable.
ZURICH ran into profit-taking in banks, insurers and recently strong
cyclical shares and the SMI index shed 3.0 to 2,420.5.
The major banks, which have risen strongly in recent weeks, encountered
selling from investors wanting to take profits ahead of half-year results
which start with UBS on Thursday. UBS bearers fell SFr14 to SFr1,210.
Nestle, the most active share, rose SFr13 to SFr1,031, reversing its decline
of last week. Swissair picked up SFr13 to finish at SFr 728 on bargain
hunting after Friday's larger than expected first half loss.
OSLO climbed to a 1993 high with the all share index up 3.37 at 549.87 in
hefty turnover of NKr618m, with the interest rate outlook continuing to fuel
the market.
HELSINKI was sharply higher on low money market rates and the HEX index
added 37.4 or 2.8 per cent to 1,389.7.
VIENNA broke up through 1,000 on the ATX index to set a new 14-month closing
high of 1,005.3, up 15.83 or 1.6 per cent. But with ATX futures leading the
market up, some dealers said that the tail was wagging the dog.
TEL AVIV rose in moderate volume, the blue chip index ending 2.07 higher at
198.52 in turnover of Shk188m.
ATHENS climbed on hopes that a bill for the partial privatisation of OTE,
the Greek telecommunications company, would be passed in parliament this
week. The general index closed 25.30, or 2.8 per cent higher at 916.25.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French futures tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH interest rate futures tumbled yesterday after the Bank of France
disappointed dealers by only reducing the cost of overnight funds by a 1/4
of a percentage point, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's easing in monetary policy was the first since the widening of
the exchange rate mechanism's bands more than a week ago. But the scale of
the move, which pushed the cost of overnight money down to 9.75 per cent,
gave the impression that France is still trying to hang on to the D-Mark's
coat-tails in the ERM, and that rates will come down slowly.
The Bank of France's strategy failed to impress money market dealers. The
franc dropped nearly 2 centimes, underlining that tight monetary policy is
not credible as far as the markets are concerned. The Bank also added
FFr18.9bn to the money market in its domestic tender, too small a sum to
bring cash rates down by much.
Three month French francs closed more-or-less unchanged by the end of the
day at 8 per cent. The September French franc contract dropped 40 basis
points, from a high of 93.50 at the start of the day to close at 93.10.
Interest rate futures dealers took the view that German rates will be about
 1/2 percentage point lower than French rates in two months time. It is only
in December that futures dealers are discounting lower rates in France than
Germany.
Euromarks were nevertheless a touch lower yesterday after Mr Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, the Bundesbank's vice-president, said at the weekend that dealers
could not expect big cuts in interest rates in the next few months. The
September Euromark contract was down 6 basis points at 93.51. There were
expectations that the Bundesbank would again hold a fixed rate repo at 6.80
per cent for 14 day maturities, only 5 basis points above the Discount rate
level.
The downbeat atmosphere affected sterling markets where the September
sterling contract fell 9 basis points to close at 94.16. Rates in the cash
market were kept high by difficulties removing a large Pounds 1.85bn
shortage. There was Pounds 730m of late assistance and the overnight rate
was as high as 11 per cent at one stage. Three month money was slightly
lower at 5.70 per cent from 5.75 per cent earlier in the day.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc weakens on rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc weakened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday after the
Bank of France decided to ease monetary policy for the first time since the
widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands, writes James Blitz.
The Bank of France cut its overnight rate of lending from 10 per cent to
9.75 per cent. The move immediately led to a sharp weakening of the franc
from about FFr3.490 to FFr3.509, a drop of nearly 2 centimes. The currency
recovered as European trading continued, but at the London close it was
coming under pressure again, closing at FFr3.507.
Last week, the Bank of France managed to keep the franc above the FFr3.50
level by keeping liquidity low in its money market.
But yesterday's move smacked of the worst of all worlds: showing the market
that interest rates are coming down and that there will be a smaller premium
on francs, but not sufficiently boosting the French economy to promote the
franc on more fundamental grounds.
With a poor foreign exchange reserve position, France may have to take a
cautious approach on rate cutting to keep the franc strong. But the
prospects for maintaining franc fort against the D-Mark look bleak, whatever
happens to interest rates.
At the weekend, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank vice-President,
said that the market should expect German interest rates to come down
quickly, despite the additional liquidity in the market. This helped to push
the D-Mark up against most European currencies yesterday.
Moreover, dealers think that European central banks will buy D-Marks in
waves in the next few months to repay the Bundesbank for supporting their
currencies in the recent crisis. The Bundesbank needs to drain the markets
of D-Marks to restore money supply growth to its target range.
Those factors helped to push down the Danish krone and the Belgian franc
yesterday in spite of the continuing tightness of their policy in money
markets.
The Belgians waived their money market tender, but their currency fell to a
low of BFr21.4023 and later closed at BFr21.24. The Danish krone closed at
DKr4.0424 to the D-Mark having been as low as DKr4.0532 at one stage.
Floating currencies also fared badly against a background of D-Mark
appreciation. The dollar closed at DM1.6970 down from a previous DM1.6975,
despite a lack of any new data in the US. Sterling lost  3/4 of a pfennig
against the D-Mark, despite strong credit business figures for June. It
closed at DM2.5350.
In both cases the fall may partly have been due to both these currencies
losing their safe haven status as calm returns to European markets.
The Italian lira bottomed out at L952.51 to the D-Mark and closed in London
at L950.3 amid expectations of sharp cuts in Italian interest rates.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Limit on CIS imports fails to
move aluminium market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALUMINIUM market was unimpressed yesterday by the European Commission's
decision at the weekend to impose short-term restrictions on imports of the
metal from the Commonwealth of Independent States. The price of metal for
delivery in three months fell on the London Metal Exchange by Dollars 15 a
tonne to Dollars 1,207.50.
Analysts pointed out that CIS aluminium would simply flow to other regions,
particularly Japan and the US, and still have a depressing impact on what
was a global commodity market.
The Russian producers group, Concern Aluminy, also warned that the block on
some imports would be ineffective. And it said it was likely to damage
European Community countries because aluminium worth Dollars 250m-Dollars
300m was used by Russia to buy raw materials, food and industrial goods from
them. The group suggested that the potential annual cost to the EC in higher
prices and the loss of tolling operations - where Russian organisations
process raw materials on behalf of foreign companies - was about Dollars
1bn.
The European Commission said that its investigation showed that the CIS
imports were causing 'serious injury' to the EC aluminium industry. The
European industry estimates that those imports rose from 123,000 tonnes in
1990 to 582,000 tonnes last year.
'Aluminium produced in the CIS states enjoys the huge advantage of
artificially low energy prices, and environmental standards there are far
less strict than those in western countries. In addition, other significant
costs involved in aluminium production are not borne by the producers,' the
Commission said.
Discussions with CIS producers so far had produced no results - not even any
production and export statistics - so, 'given the extreme urgency of the
situation', the Commission would limit aluminium imports from the CIS to
60,000 tonnes in the months to the end of November.
The Commission said it would continue to work hard for a negotiated
settlement but it implied further action would be taken if no agreement was
reached by the end of November.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, suggested the European industry had
lost an opportunity for further necessary rationalisation. It was true that
Europe accounted for 25 per cent of the western world's supply of aluminium
and had suffered 80 per cent of the capacity cuts so far, 'but this is right
because so many European smelters are high-cost and small'.
The European Aluminium Association gave a guarded welcome to the
Commission's action and said it remained willing to support the efforts of
the CIS aluminium industry to stimulate its domestic consumption of the
metal and to modernise its production facilities.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec oil output 1m barrels over
quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NICOSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced more than 1m
barrels a day above its oil output quota in July, Reuter reports from
Nicosia.
According to the Middle East Economic Survey, the weekly oil newsletter,
Opec's July production was 24.64m b/d - about 230,000 b/d above the total
for June. Iran's output dropped by 71,000 b/d to 3.62m b/d, but that was
still above the country's Opec quota of 3.34m b/d.
The newsletter said Kuwait's production rose by 150,000 b/d to 1.9m b/d in
July. Kuwait refused to join Opec's third-quarter quota accord in June and
insisted on a higher production allocation. 'A large part of the additional
supply came from Kuwait - now quota-free and programmed to reach 2.16m b/d
by September,' the survey said.
Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer and exporter, produced 8.15m b/d in
July, but 'actual sales deliveries were reckoned to have stayed within the
quota of 8m b/d, with the balance destined for overseas storage', the
newsletter said.
It suggested that during the third quarter Opec countries would continue
producing above their overall quota of 23.582m b/d.
'This is likely to rise further as the third quarter progresses owing to
projected higher output from Kuwait and other factors.'
The newsletter said Iran's crude exports had consistently fallen this year
within the range of 2.7m-2.9m b/d.
World oil prices rose by nearly 40 cents a barrel after a surprise
announcement that Mr Jean Ping, president of Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, would join a quota compliance committee meeting in
Vienna today.
Mr Ping, oil minister of Gabon, will join the oil ministers of Libya and
Qatar as well as the secretary-general of Opec, Mr Subroto of Indonesia, for
the Vienna meeting to review the group's July production figures.
London September futures of the world benchmark crude oil, North Sea Brent
Blend, began to move up from just below Dollars 16.30 a barrel on the news.
The price rallied to Dollars 16.64 as petrol prices rose on fears of a
shortage because of refinery problems in the US.
Overproduction by some of the 12 members of Opec has been blamed for the
recent slide in oil prices, which fell below Dollars 16 last month.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia to decide on ZCCM
privatisation by end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Zambian government is likely to make a decision by the end of the year
about privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the company that
dominates the country's economy.
Mr Mathias Mpande, deputy minister of mines, confirmed that a German company
contracted to investigate and comment on the privatisation options for ZCCM
was scheduled to report by October or November. 'Government should then be
able to make a decision by the end of the year,' he said.
Mr Mpande said that privatising ZCCM had become urgent because of the
economic need to attract foreign investment. In particular, a decision would
have to be made by early next year on the financing of the Konkola deep mine
in the north of the copper belt.
That project, which will probably cost about USDollars 550m, must proceed if
the company is to achieve a sustainable annual production level of
450,000-500,000 tonnes of copper. It will have to be equity-funded because
ZCCM and the Zambian government already have high debt burdens. ZCCM has a
debt of about Dollars 700m.
Mr Mpande suggested that a sell-off in stages was more likely than a one-off
auction as the former course would allow for an increased number of
shareholders and thus enhance the acceptability of 'corporate capitalism'.
He said that putting the whole of ZCCM into private hands was a sensitive
issue as the company accounted for more than 90 per cent of the country's
export earnings and was regarded as a 'national treasure'.
Foreign investors also favour the government keeping a stake, he added.
Mr Mpande confirmed that South African mining group Anglo American was at
the front of the queue for a stake in a privatised ZCCM. He described the
company as 'very, very keen' and he said discussions had taken place nearly
every month.
Given the large stake of 27.3 per cent that Anglo already holds in ZCCM, Mr
Mpande said 'it would not be right for them to be outplayed by a newcomer'.
He predicted that Anglo would increase its stake to the limits of its equity
capacity but that it would not be able to go it alone. 'Other important
mining companies should be involved,' he said.
Dismissing speculation that some mining houses might have blotted their
copybooks by being too closely involved with the discredited Kaunda
government, Mr Mpande said: 'What will dictate who gets what will be their
offer and strategic plans, rather than their past dalliances.'

Comalco and the Queensland government to protect the aluminium producer from
aboriginal claims to its bauxite leases in the state, Reuter reports from
Melbourne.
Comalco, 67 per cent owned by the CRA resources group, said last month it
had been served with a native land claim by the aboriginal Wik people over
more than 35,000 sq km of land covering its Weipa bauxite leases.
The company's share price fell by more more than 4 per cent in response to
concern about the claims, which ANZ McCaughan analyst Mr Ray Chantry said
put ADollars 1.83bn (Pounds 820m) of investment by Comalco in doubt. Mr
Keating's decision has 'dramatic ramifications in the mining industry', Mr
Chantry said.
The investment concerned covered an ADollars 750m planned purchase of the
Gladstone power station from the Queensland government, a ADollars 200m
upgrade of the power station and an Dollars 880m expansion of the Boyne
Island aluminium smelter in Gladstone. Mr John Ralph, Comalco's chairman,
has warned that lenders will not fund the expansion if they cannot be
guaranteed they will not suffer a loss.
Queensland's premier, Mr Wayne Goss, said that the Australian government had
to take action to protect Comalco's proposed investment.
Mr Chantry said it was hard to quantify the effect of the land claim on the
aluminium producer's earnings, adding that the stock was expensive in view
of the weak metal price.
He said Comalco shares had risen from ADollars 3.75 last week in response to
upgrades of European economic growth forecasts, which lifted most metal
producers' share prices.
Another analyst said he believed Comalco was reasonably priced in view of
the concern over the leases. 'The capitalisation of Comalco is at stake,' he
said, adding that the company's future was based on the Weipa bauxite
leases.
He said he believed Mr Ralph was serious in his warnings about the dangers
that the claim posed to the company's planned investment. 'There would be no
international financier willing to lend money when there's some concern
about the leases at Weipa,' the analyst said.
If the company lost access to the Weipa leases, it would have to find
another mineral source to supply its smelters, he said.

sales

MALAYSIA is trying to persuade China to buy more of its palm oil.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, said that
during a visit to China he hoped to persuade the authorities there to reduce
import tariffs on palm oil from the present 28 per cent to 20 per cent.
Last year China imported 854,000 tonnes of palm oil, of which about 550,000
tonnes originated in Malaysia. Mr Lim said that China's imports of edible
oils and fats were likely to nearly double to 3m tonnes over the next few
years.
Malaysia is offering China USDollars 100m of credits to enter into long-term
purchasing agreements for its palm oil. Under the credit scheme China would
enter into contracts to purchase from Malaysia a minimum of 300,000 tonnes
of palm oil a year over an extended period.
Last year Malaysia produced more than 6.3m tonnes of palm oil, accounting
for about 55 per cent of total world output.
The country is trying to diversify its palm oil export markets. It is hoping
for significant volumes of exports to Russia in coming months as part of a
countertrade deal under which the Malaysian air force is taking delivery of
18 Russian-built Mig fighter jets.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industry rejects forecast for
Indian jute crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JUTE MILLERS and traders in India believe the government is being wildly
optimistic in forecasting a 600,000-bale rise in the country's jute crop
during the 1993-94 season.
With the season now in its second month and the market arrival of the new
fibre steadily growing, the agriculture ministry's projection of a crop of
7.6m bales (1.8kg each) has surprised the Indian Jute Mills Association,
which expects the crop to be down on last year's at about 6.5m bales. The
Jute Balers Association, which monitors the crop in all growing areas,
thinks it will be even lower, at 6.3m bales.
The Jute Corporation of India, the government procurement agency, also
thinks the ministry's estimate is too high. Last year the crop turned out to
be 7m bales compared with the ministry's forecast of 7.5m.
Industry experts also disagree with the government over its estimate that
the current season opened with stocks of 2m bales, insisting that the
carry-over from 1992-93 was no more than 1.5m bales.
All the agencies agree that the extensive floods in Assam and north Bengal
have caused little damage to the standing jute crop, but they expect fibre
supply to be tight throughout 1993-94, with the prices rising as the season
progresses.
In view of the short crop, the industry has demanded that the government put
a ban on the export of raw jute in the current season. India resumed the
export of fibre two years ago after a break of nearly a decade.
However, the shippers contend that no purpose will be served by stopping the
export of low-grade fibre.
The government is reported to be planning to encourage the import of
high-quality jute by the mills for the production of exportable jute goods.
According to the Jute Advisory Board, a minimum of 300,000 bales of fibre
will be imported this season.
According to Mr SS Chattopadhyay, India'a jute commissioner, the jute mills
will need 7.8m bales while village demand for raw jute will be about 600,000
bales.
The Indian paper mills have also started using jute as a raw material.
In order to persuade the farmers to grow more jute, the government has
raised the minimum price of the benchmark grade by Rs50 (Pounds 1.06) to
Rs450 a quintal (100lb). But the higher minimum price is unlikely to be
maintained during the peak fibre arrival period of September to November
unless the Jute Corporation is provided with adequate funds to intervene in
the market.
Hardly any purpose will be served if the jute prices go up once the farmers
have sold their stocks at low rates.

producer

<TEXT>
GREECE'S LARCO, which formerly produced 4 per cent of the world's nickel,
could go bankrupt and close within months, Reuter reports from Athens.
'If Larco is not privatised soon then it is condemned to closure,' a Larco
official said.
The company has a serious cash shortage and has been hit by strikes and
payment disputes with the state power corporation. It lost Dr9.6bn (Pounds
26m) in 1992, following Dr7.7bn in 1991. Turnover was Dr19.5bn in 1992, down
from Dr24.5bn the previous year.
Larco, whose customers are Europe's major steelmakers, has capacity to
produce 17,000 tonnes of contained nickel a year. Production rose to 1,030
tonnes in July from about 700 tonnes a month in November 1992 when an
eight-month survival plan was introduced. That involved temporarily halving
both output and working hours. The arrangement ended in July.
The output target for the rest of 1993 is 1,200-1,300 tonnes a month, a
mainly dictated by the Greek government's reluctance to order redundancies.
Workers protesting against management's refusal to award a pay rise for 1992
and 1993 are staging one four-hour stoppage a week until August 31.
Mr Yannis Zournadzis, the managing director, has cut the workforce by 18 per
cent since 1990 with employment at Larco's plant, mines and headquarters
dropping to 1,580 from 1,930. 'We have achieved about 40 voluntary
redundancies recently but cannot afford to pay more severance,' he said.
In another dispute, Larco and the Public Power Corporation are trying to
agree on electricity discounts for 1993.
Under the 1992 agreement, Larco pays a base Dr6.026 per kWh, a charge that
rises in line with the London Metal Exchange's three-month nickel price and
month-on-month Greek inflation.
The PPC is believed to be owed Dr1.4bn by Larco, which confirmed that
'several months' of bills were unpaid.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spain acts to resolve peach
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BELINDA FOWLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN PEACH dealers had their eyes and ears fixed on Spain yesterday
following rumours that two markets had offered large quantities of peaches
for sale to the Spanish intervention board in an effort to rescue the
European market from crisis.
The ministry of agriculture in Madrid confirmed that both Zaragoza and
Murtia markets were planning to offer smaller-sized peaches for public sale,
although until prices were known, quantities remained uncertain.
Mr Guardo Angel, a technical adviser at the ministry, said the Spanish
markets hoped success would mean a quick end to the crisis, which had been
dogging them for the past 10 days.
The crisis was made official a week ago by the European parliament. It began
in Zaragoza on July 27 and 28 when the price for Jeronimo peaches fell below
the European crisis level of Ecu20.62 or Pta37.68 (18p) a kg to Pta36.4.
Before the crisis can be declared over officially the markets will have to
sell above the crisis point for three consecutive days.
A Brussels official said the situation had been caused more by a lack of
public demand for peaches all over Europe than by excessive volumes entering
the market. He said recession-torn European consumers had been cutting back
on fruit and vegetables rather than potatoes, bread, meat or fish.
Mr Angel also blamed higher than normal production levels in Spain.
A similar situation involving Portugal as well as Spain arose last year.

The GOLD price recovered some of last week's heavy losses yesterday as Swiss
and Far Eastern buyers returned the the market. It closed at the London
bullion market at Dollars 382.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5.75, after
meeting resistance at Dollars 383. Base metal markets were generally easier
at the London Metal Exchange. ZINC remained under pressure following
Friday's breach of the Dollars 900-a-tonne barrier for three months metal
and investment fund liquidation drove the price to a fresh six-year low of
Dollars 880 at one stage. The COPPER market was also lower, although nearby
premiums remained. Final business for the three three months position was at
Dollars 1,933 a tonne, down Dollars 12 from Friday. At the London Commodity
Exchange robusta COFFEE futures continued Friday's retracement in early
trading. But roaster buying was encountered at Dollars 1,100 a tonne for the
November position, which closed Dollars 28 up on balance at Dollars 1,142 a
tonne. Traders said the rise was mainly due to the absence of any aggressive
selling rather than any fresh fundamental news. Attention in London
continued to be focused on near September options which expire on August 18.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Cut in French overnight rate fails to
impress
</HEADLINE>

AFTER the European exchange rate excitement and bond market rallies of the
last week, the continental fixed-income markets slipped back yesterday on
disappointment at the lack of any substantial interest rate cuts.
The Banque de France snipped 25 basis points off its overnight rate, from 10
per cent to 9.75 per cent. But, much to the market's disappointment, it left
the five-to-10-day rate unchanged at 10 per cent, and the bond market edged
lower.
Some analysts had expected to see the five-to-10-day rate lowered to 7.75
per cent - where it was before the ERM crisis - and many market participants
were disappointed that the central bank had not acted more swiftly to bring
down interest rates, given the new 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
The Matif's September futures contract ended at 121.92, down 0.18, while the
10-year OAT yielded 6.37 per cent, against 6.36 per cent at its previous
close.
GERMANY started the day on an upbeat note, with the Liffe bund futures
contract opening at 97.26 and quickly reaching its high of the day at 97.36.
However, bunds drifted lower as the market digested weekend press comments
from Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank council member.
Mr Gaddum warned against growing German rate cut hopes and added that it was
by no means certain that the Bundesbank would set a variable rate tender for
securities repurchase funds this week.
Dealers said the market would be watching this week's repo closely to see if
the rate fell from last week's minimum rate on one-month repo funds of 6.70
per cent - five basis points below the discount rate.
FOLLOWING Congressional approval of President Bill Clinton's first budget,
US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the market, sending long yields to
new record lows yesterday.
In late trading, trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 108
9/16 , yielding 6.469 per cent, a new all-time low.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 11/32
, to yield 4.050 per cent.
Prices firmed from the start, buoyed by last Friday's approval by the Senate
of Mr Clinton's deficit-reduction package.
Traders also reported strong interest from overseas investors, especially by
the Brazilian government, which was said to need zero-coupon bonds to
collateralise its debt agreement with commercial banks.
Although Brazil later denied it had been buying zero coupons, dealers
speculated that the US Treasury may have been in the market on Brazil's
behalf.
Sentiment was also aided by expectations of good demand at this week's
auction of Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds. It will be the last bond auction
this year, and investors are said to be keen on the issue in spite of low
interest rates. The bond was at a record low yield of 6.428 per cent in
when-issued trading yesterday.
THE combination of sterling weakness and new supply initially depressed the
UK gilts market, although prices later recovered and the Liffe futures
contract ended the day little changed at 111.15.
Dealers said the July producer price data, released yesterday, was in line
with market expectations, confirming the favourable inflation background.
However, the Bank of England's announcement on Friday afternoon of a total
of Pounds 1.5bn in assorted tap stocks dampened sentiment, according to some
dealers.
JAPANESE government bonds made strong gains, responding favourably to news
of the US Senate's approval of President Clinton's deficit-cutting proposals
and positive statements on the domestic front by the new finance minister.
Comments by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister in new prime minister Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet, also helped to lift the market. Mr
Fujii said that he opposed issuing deficit-financing bonds in order to fund
a cut in income tax.
The September futures contract rallied to close at 111.60, the highest level
since late February, having opened at 111.13.
In the cash market, the benchmark 10-year issue ended at a yield of 4.125
per cent, having ranged between 4.115 and 4.185 per cent.

PORTUGAL plans to set up a futures market in fixed-rate treasury bonds by
the end of 1994, but first the government wants to streamline and simplify
cash market trading, said Mr Manuel Pinho, treasury director, Reuter reports
from Lisbon.
'It is very probable that by the end of 1994 the national futures market
will be ready,' he added. Dealers say that any prolonged delay will
encourage banks to go ahead with alternative plans to establish a bond
futures contract offshore, probably in London or Frankfurt.
Bankers Trust and Banco Portugues do Investimento took a step in this
direction last month by launching a nine-month warrant on the Frankfurt
stock exchange linked to five-year Portuguese treasury bonds.
Mr Pinho said the finance ministry would cut trading costs and boost
turnover in the cash market by the end of 1993.
'Basically, the futures market must be supported by a cash market in
fixed-rate bonds that has depth and liquidity,' the treasury director said.
The cash market would have to adopt tax regulations in line with more
developed markets.
Mr Pinho hinted in June that the government might exempt non-residents from
withholding taxes of 15 to 20 per cent on all bond and share transactions in
Portugal.
He also said the government might shift the reference date for interest
payments on bonds to the transaction date from the settlement date, which is
four working days later.
Government sources said the treasury was also looking at the establishment
of a new inter-bank market for bonds, outside the confines of Portugal's two
stock exchanges, where dealing would be simpler and costs lower.
Portugal began issuing fixed-rate treasury bonds in 1991, and the market
accounts for more than three-quarters of turnover on the Lisbon and Oporto
exchanges.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Foreigners' fears drive
Argentina's modernisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is attempting to improve the poor reputation of its capital
markets in an attempt to accelerate the inflow of much-needed foreign
capital.
Some foreign investors complain bitterly about being 'cheated' by brokers
and companies. They claim company accounts are misleading and profits
concealed for the benefit of majority shareholders.
But Argentina has scrapped exchange controls, deregulated markets, and
offered privatisations and private bond issues. It is trying to impose
modern trading and disclosure standards, following the leads of Chile and
Mexico, Latin America's free-market trail-blazers.
In April, the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV), the securities watchdog,
sent a bill to Congress that legally defines for the first time offences
such as market manipulation or insider trading.
The bill proposes heavy fines - a minimum of Dollars 5m for market
manipulation, for instance (the current maximum fine is a mere Dollars
7,919). However, the bill is making little progress, largely due to the
quiet opposition of the financial industry.
Meanwhile, the CNV is doing what it can by using its administrative powers.
Mr Martin Redrado, the commission's president, has initiated 86
investigations, stopped three public offerings, temporarily suspended 12
brokers and issued 66 warnings to companies.
The CNV now requires bond issuers to be checked by independent credit-rating
agencies. There are now seven such agencies in operation, usually in
alliance with respected overseas names like the UK's IBCA.
The agencies seem to have overcome some foreign bankers' misgivings about
their independence and ability. Only two borrowers - Dutch-owned Banco
Holandes Unido and Banco Rio, Argentina's biggest private bank - have
received triple-A ratings. Most others range between double-A and triple-B.
However, Mr Christopher Ecclestone, a Buenos Aires-based analyst, says that
ratings for some companies are still far too generous.
Mr Redrado has also publicly rebuked companies which publish inadequate
accounts. However, the CNV is split between trying to be referee and
cheerleader at the same time.
The commission took a leading role in last year's Dollars 1.2bn flotation of
Telecom Argentina, a privatised telephone company, which soon lost 30 per
cent of its value. The Telecom flop helped precipitate last June's market
collapse and cast a shadow over both the market and the CNV.
The CNV is understaffed and underfunded and - in spite of one investigation
into a suspected case of market manipulation - has not uncovered any
evidence of large-scale cheating. Even when it has caught relatively minor
offenders, it has been unable to apply more than symbolic punishment.
However, the bigger, tougher and better-financed DGI tax department is
making an important contribution to transparency in its war against tax
evasion.
It has put businessmen behind bars, closed companies and imposed hefty
fines. This has encouraged companies to declare more of their income to the
tax collector, and thus to small shareholders, too.
The drift to screen-based trading makes it easier to detect immediately
suspicious price movements. Soon, all but a few highly liquid shares which
can continue to be traded on the Buenos Aires stock exchange floor will have
to be traded electronically.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to modernisation is the resistance of the
market itself. Insider trading is common because few brokers consider it
immoral, let alone an offence.
But the greatest force for change is coming from overseas. Cash-hungry
Argentine companies are approaching international markets in increasing
numbers, and are having to conform with stricter disclosure and accounting
norms.

quiet day

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank provided the main focus of activity in a quiet start to the
week for the international bond market, borrowing DM1bn through an offering
of four-year Eurobonds.
In contrast to last week, when Denmark raised a record Pounds 1.3bn in the
sterling Eurobond market, syndicate managers said they expected the market
to remain uneventful for the rest of the week as investors and borrowers
take their summer holidays.
Deutsche Bank's bonds were priced to yield 11 basis points above the series
101 of medium-term German government bonds and traded inside fees shortly
after the launch, the bank said.
Demand came from investors in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux.
Meanwhile, the World Bank has made progress on the legal framework for its
first D-Mark global bond and expects to raise around DM3bn through the
offering later this year, market conditions permitting.
The Bank also plans to issue another dollar global bond at around the same
time.
Mr Hans Rothenbuhler, head of the Bank's European currency borrowing
division, said the launch of the D-Mark global bond had been delayed by
legal issues arising from the unprecedented attempt to link the German and
US domestic clearing systems.
'We should have everything in place in the autumn,' he said.
He added that the lead managers for the D-Mark deal - most likely to be one
German and one non-German bank - would be announced in the coming weeks. The
maturity of the bonds would be decided closer to the launch.

SHOWA DENKO, the Japanese chemicals producer being forced to settle damages
claims in the US as a result of blood disorders caused by a dietary
supplement it marketed there, took an extraordinary charge of Y46.18bn
(Dollars 442m) in the half-year to June to cover the suits.
Although it was able to offset more than half of this by selling land and
other assets, the interim net loss was still Y17.24bn, compared with
earnings last time of Y1.09bn.
The food additive, L-tryptophan, was withdrawn in 1989. More than 1,500
Americans were affected, of whom some 30 died.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SARA LEE, the Chicago-based food and consumer products company, yesterday
reported an 11.8 increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 190m after
tax. Sales advanced by 13.3 per cent to Dollars 3.85bn.
The final-quarter's results left Sara Lee posting an underlying 12.9 per
cent advance in earnings per share to Dollars 1.40 for the 12 months to July
3.
Net profits actually showed a small fall from Dollars 761m to Dollars 704m,
but the previous year's results included a one-off pre-tax gain from the
sale of the over-the-counter drugs business, only partially offset by some
restructuring costs. This added a net Dollars 222m to the 1991-2 results at
the pre-tax level.
In the final quarter, the only weak division was personal products, where
operating profits fell by 4.3 per cent to Dollars 144m, on sales 12.8 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.54bn.
Sara Lee, which takes in brand-names such as Hanes, L'eggs and Dim, said
that markets were depressed in Europe, especially in the hosiery area.
Elsewhere, operating profits on the household and personal care side surged
by 45.7 per cent to Dollars 48m, on a 4.7 per cent sales gain to Dollars
351m.
The group said that this reflected increased sales of higher margin 'core
category products and improved operating efficiencies'.
On the food side, the packaged meats and bakery division advanced by 6.4 per
cent, to an operating profit of Dollars 93m, on sales up by one-fifth at
Dollars 1.44bn.
The coffee and grocery business improved operating profits by 9.2 per cent
to Dollars 66m, with sales rising by 3.7 per cent to Dollars 517m.
For the year overall, Sara Lee saw a 10.1 per cent advance in sales to
Dollars 14.6bn. The company's shares advanced modestly on the results,
adding Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 21 5/8.

Chugai Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drugs company, has attributed a
rise in mid-term profits to brisk sales of its new renal anaemia drug,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Chugai's non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to June rose
10.2 per cent, to Y6.3bn (Dollars 60.29m), on a 6.4 per cent rise in sales
to Y73.1bn. After-tax profits jumped 40.5 per cent to Y2.9bn, although the
previous year the company recorded the losses on affiliates' investments.
Sales of Chugai's renal anaemia drug, which rose by more than 30 per cent
for the first half, offset costs from the company's equity-linked financing,
it said.

<TEXT>
GENENTECH, the US biotechnology company, yesterday moved a step closer to
launching its proposed new treatment for cystic fibrosis when the key Food
and Drug Administration committee reviewing the drug unanimously recommended
its approval.
The company earlier in the day received an apparent setback when staff
members of the US Food and Drug Administration said the drug, known as
Pulmozyme or DNase, needed further testing.
The company's shares had fallen Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 42 3/8 by the close
in New York on the staff report, which called into question the long-term
safety and effectiveness of the drug. The report was presented to the FDA's
pulmonary-allergy drugs advisory committee, which issues recommendations on
whether or not the full FDA should approve new drugs in its area.
After the stock market close, however, the advisory committee unanimously
voted to recommend that the drug be approved.
Although the committee's recommendation is not binding, is almost always
accepted by the FDA.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Pfizer costs taxation changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER yesterday became the first US drugs company to quantify publicly the
cost of the Clinton tax changes on its business, saying its effective tax
rate would rise from an expected 26 per cent this year to 30 per cent in
1994.
Like other drugs companies, Pfizer manufactures many of its products in
Puerto Rico and so will be hit by a reduction in the tax relief on
operations located there.
The reduction in this relief, available under Section 936 of the US tax
code, makes the drugs industry one of the biggest losers from last week's
tax package.
Pfizer said that, although the effect of the tax change was unlikely to come
as a surprise, it was significant enough to warrant a statement. The
company's shares gained Dollars  1/2 to 59 5/8 by midday in New York.
Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories, a US manufacturer of healthcare products,
said the tax changes would add Dollars 50m to its tax bill next year.
The company, which had net earnings last year of Dollars 1.2bn, said the
increase was due to the Section 936 change and the one percentage point
increase in the corporate tax rate.
It added, however, that a research and development tax credit would
partially offset the increase.

SHOWA DENKO, the Japanese chemicals producer which is being forced to settle
damages claims in the US as a result of blood disorders caused by a dietary
supplement it marketed there, took an extraordinary charge of Y46.18bn
(Dollars 442m) in the half-year to June to cover the suits.
The company was able to offset more than half of this by selling land and
other assets, which brought in Y24.28bn, but it still suffered an interim
net loss of Y17.24bn, compared with earnings last time of Y1.09bn.
The food additive, L-tryptophan, was withdrawn in 1989. More than 1,500
Americans were affected, of whom some 30 died.
Showa Denko has been hoping to settle the bulk of the legal cases this year.
Its mainstream businesses, meanwhile, suffered from the economic downturn in
Japan. Parent company first-half sales were down 9.5 per cent to Y235.3bn
and pre-tax profits were halved to Y1.42bn from Y2.84bn.
For the full year, Showa Denko forecast sales down 7.6 per cent to Y470bn,
and a break-even at the pre-tax level, where in 1992 it earned Y3.36bn, but
said it could not make a projection for net earnings.
No dividend has been paid since 1990.

<TEXT>
CHARTER Medical, the US hospitals company which emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last year, yesterday announced the Dollars 340m sale
of 10 hospitals as part of its efforts to reduce borrowings.
The sale of the 10 general acute care hospitals, to Quorum Health Group,
will leave the company with 78 psychiatric hospitals and a focus on mental
health care, Charter said.
Following its move to pay off Dollars 50m of senior debt recently, Charter
said the disposal would leave it with Dollars 429m of debt. In the three
months to the end of June, Charter's operating profits edged ahead on higher
turnover, from Dollars 63.5m to Dollars 66.3m.
However, the amortisation of charges related to its financial restructuring
last year, which followed a disastrous leveraged buy-out in 1988, led to a
net loss for the period of Dollars 5.3m. The amortisations will continue
until the end of 1995, Charter said.
Mr Mac Crawford, chairman, said: 'The sale is consistent with Charter's
previously-stated objective of reducing debt and its continued focus on
being a major provider of mental health care services.'

MAY Department Stores, one of the largest department store operators in the
US, yesterday reported an underlying 22 per cent increase in second-quarter
earnings per share, at 44 cents, in the three months to end-July.
May's actual after-tax profits for the period fell from Dollars 393m to
Dollars 117m, but the 1992 results were boosted by a one-off gain of Dollars
298m pre-tax.
Had this been excluded, May said second-quarter after-tax profits would have
risen from Dollars 95m to Dollars 117m year-on-year.
May's sales overall rose from Dollars 2.31bn to Dollars 2.5bn, with Dollars
513m, against Dollars 452m, coming from the Payless ShoeSource division, and
Dollars 1.99bn, compared with Dollars 1.86bn, from the department stores.
During the quarter, May opened a new Kaufmann's department store in
Syracuse, New York, and a net 70 new Payless shoe stores.
May, which recently outlined wide-ranging expansion plans, said it would
open another 11 department stores during the remainder of 1993, and add
about 150 Payless outlets by the end of its current financial year.
The second-quarter results mean May's after-tax profits for the first half
of the year stand at Dollars 213m, with sales rising to Dollars 4.82bn from
Dollars 4.51bn.

CHUGAI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drugs company, has attributed a
rise in mid-term profits to brisk sales of its new renal anaemia drug.
Chugai's non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to June rose
10.2 per cent, to Y6.3bn (Dollars 60.29m), on a 6.4 per cent rise in sales
to Y73.1bn. After-tax profits jumped 40.5 per cent to Y2.9bn, although the
previous year the company recorded the losses on affiliates' investments.
Sales of Chugai's renal anaemia drug, which rose by more than 30 per cent
for the first half, offset costs from the company's equity-linked financing,
it said.
The increase in sales of newly-developed drugs, which have larger margins
than existing products, made up for sharp falls in sales of ethical and
over-the-counter drugs.
For the full year to December, Chugai expects financial investments to
contribute to profit growth.
The company projects a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Y17bn on a
5.4 per cent increase in annual sales to Y151bn. After-tax profits are
expected to rise 42.9 per cent to Y7.5bn, and Chugai plans to increase its
annual dividend payment to Y9 per share from Y7.5.

HKDollars 830m rights

<TEXT>
THE Cross Harbour Tunnel Company (CHT) plans to raise HKDollars 830m
(USDollars 107m) from a one-for-two rights issue at HKDollars 13 a share to
fund construction of Hong Kong's new Western Harbour tunnel, which received
approval from China in June.
It is the first private financing for a core project in Hong Kong's
HKDollars 165bn airport development programme. CHT has a 37 per cent
interest in the Western Tunnel, with Chinese partners Citic and China
Merchants.
The rights offer is being made at a 35 per cent discount to last night's
closing price of HKDollars 20.10 per share. The Wharf Group, which owns 27
per cent of CHT, has agreed to take up its share of entitlements in the
issue.
The new tunnel is estimated to cost HKDollars 7.5bn and must be completed by
August 1997 since it will link with the expressway leading to Chek Lap Kok
airport. The airport is due to open in mid-1997.
CHT will inject HKDollars 922m in equity into the project and additional
loan finance is being finalised.
The company constructed the first tunnel to link Hong Kong island with the
Kowloon peninsula. It was launched on a 30-year operating franchise and
reverts to the government in August 1999.
It also owns 70 per cent of the highly profitable Hong Kong School of
Motoring, but the company's main income in the future will come from the new
tunnel.
The franchise for the Western crossing has been described by some
politicians as overly favourable to the operators, who are guaranteed toll
increases giving a minimum return on equity of 15 per cent.

YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company, nearly doubled its
first-half net profits, despite a relatively small rise in sales, writes
John Barham in Buenos Aires.
First-half earnings were Dollars 230.3m on sales of Dollars 1.91bn. In the
same period last year it earned Dollars 127m on sales of Dollars 1.81bn.
Analysts said the results were in line with the market's expectations. The
company said during its privatisation in June that it estimated 1993

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand to split into four
parts

<TEXT>
BARLOW Rand, South Africa's largest industrial company, has announced
details of a corporate restructuring which will see the group broken up into
four separate parts.
The announcement comes a week after Gencor, the country's second-largest
mining house, announced details of plans to break up the group.
It is not, however, expected to herald an unbundling trend among the
country's big groups. Anglo American and Rembrandt, two of the largest
conglomerates, have both said they have no such plans.
Although there are political pressures, notably from the ANC, for the big
groups to unbundle, there is no indication that this was a factor in
Barlow's decision.
Key points in the plan are:
The rump of Barlow will include a 79 per cent holding in J Bibby &amp; Sons, the
group's offshore arm, a 60 per cent holding in Pretoria Portland Cement, and
wholly-owned businesses ranging from domestic appliances to capital
equipment;
CG Smith, which will have a consumer focus, and include the group's food,
pharmaceutical, packaging, and textiles interests;
Reunert, which will focus on electronics and information technology;
Rand Mines, whose main asset is a 71 per cent stake in Randcoal, one of the
country's main coal houses, and Rand Mines Properties (RMP).
Existing Barlow shareholders will receive separate shares in CG Smith,
Reunert, Rand Mines and RMP.
To repay debt and build up funds after its reconstitution, Barlow will raise
R607m (Dollars 180m) by selling 7.5 per cent of the share capital of CG
Smith, Reunert, Rand Mines and RMP shares, to Old Mutual, its largest
shareholder.
A detailed announcement will be made by September 30 and the implementation
of the proposals should be completed by the end of February 1994.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Petrofina warns of profits
tumble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PETROFINA, the oil group which is one of Belgium's largest industrial
companies, yesterday warned that consolidated profits in the first half were
likely to tumble to BFr3.8bn (Dollars 105m) compared with BFr4.16bn last
time.
The warning came with a forecast that cash-flow for the first six months of
1993 was also likely to be reduced from BFr19bn to BFr15.5bn. Turnover was
also down from BFr270bn to BFr265bn.
Petrofina blamed the 'persistent depression' in all industrial sectors in
Europe and the US, particularly in chemicals. Margins in the first quarter
were extremely weak in refining and petrochemicals, while crude oil prices
declined progressively, the company said.
In chemicals, US profits offset losses in Europe, although profitability
remained below the first half of 1992. Although the European refineries
enjoyed a recovery in margins, these were reduced by a four-week strike at
the company's Antwerp refinery.
Results for the first half include BFr2.5bn in gains from sales of gas
properties in the US and real estate in Belgium. They also include BFr500m
in accelerated depreciation and restructuring costs. By comparison, the 1992
half-yearly results included a write-back on a provision on stock amounting
to BFr1.3bn.
Petrofina said it hoped the slow reduction in interest rates and the rise in
the value of the dollar at the end of the second quarter offered some hope
of a recovery.
Petrofina was the subject of takeover speculation earlier this year,
following a decision to cut its dividend for the first time since 1959,
after consolidated profits fell 72 per cent to BFr4.6bn in 1992.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Papermakers turn over a new leaf
 -Gordon Cramb examines a Japanese industry which is attracting trade
authority scrutiny as it consolidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OJI PAPER, the pre-war giant of Japanese papermaking, is having to shrink a
bit in order to grow again.
As a downturn in prices and demand prompts a consolidation in the industry,
which like others was broken up during the US occupation, the country's
paper market is attracting the attention of trade authorities in Washington
and Tokyo.
Oji and Jujo Paper, which was spun off from it in 1949 as part of the
dismantling of the zaibatsu industrial groups, have in the past year
embarked on mergers with other producers in an attempt to tackle
overcapacity.
In April, Jujo joined with Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp to become Nippon Paper
Industries, and Oji is to unite in October with Kanzaki Paper to form New
Oji Paper. The two combines will vie for leadership of the industry.
Analysts see modest advantages in the moves. A larger group will be able to
concentrate operations on the more efficient of its mills while being better
able to shift production around the country to minimise transport costs,
says Mr Masato Makiyama, of Salomon Bros in Tokyo. Significant job cuts,
however, may be achievable only over time, if at all.
Oji has recently announced several divestments, which it said were designed
to avoid falling foul of the country's anti-trust law. New Oji will, within
two to three years, reduce its stakes in Japan Pulp and Paper and Daiei
Papers, two companies which trade in paper and which would each do more than
one-third of their business with the merged group. The move comes at the
behest of Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC).
In the case of Japan Pulp and Paper, which has a first section Tokyo
listing, a 5 per cent holding in the company would be sold - at the current
market price it would yield some Y4.9bn (Dollars 47m). New Oji would still
own more than 11 per cent of the company.
Last month, Oji said it would divest production of certain quality coated
papers to meet monopolies requirements before the merger. It is transferring
production facilities and marketing rights for two types of specialist
paper, used for magazine and book covers, to Chuetsu Pulp and Paper, in
which Oji is the biggest shareholder with 7.6 per cent. A final sale to
Chuetsu, the 12th biggest papermaker, would take place after three or four
years.
Kanzaki has specialised in coated papers, in which it has a larger market
share than Oji. Together, they account for more than one-quarter of the
domestic market in that sector, a level which would attract regulatory
scrutiny.
The FTC said a remaining issue was Oji's stake in Chuetsu, which should
eventually be sold - in the market the value of the holding is about Y4bn.
In the meantime, Oji had expressed willingness not to use its position to
attempt to influence the smaller producer. Oji also said it planned no
further disposals.
Mr George Bush put the Japanese paper market on the agenda for the first
time during his visit to Tokyo as US presidentlast year, maintaining that US
producers faced barriers to market entry. One swift result was that foreign
companies were given more than one-third of the orders for telephone
directory paper placed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the
semi-privatised telecoms giant. Jujo, as a result, missed out on sales put
by one estimate at Y5bn.
The distribution companies also agreed to strengthen trading ties with
foreign producers, which have hitherto accounted for less than 4 per cent of
the Japanese market, with sales largely of low value-added products.
Although transport costs and the just-in-time delivery requirements of
Japanese printing companies are thought likely to continue to inhibit
foreign companies some fear the Clinton administration may press for
numerical targets on imports, as in some other industries.
For domestic producers, such a move could hardly come at a worse time.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Finance chief says VW on road to
profit in 1994

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's leading volume carmaker, is on the road to a profit in
1994, Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director, said yesterday.
The recovery from losses of DM1.6bn in the first half of the current year
was under way and would continue into next year, when group turnover should
recover to 1992 levels of around DM85bn (Dollars 50bn).
However, Mr Schmidt added, there were still 'imponderables' such as exchange
rate variations to be taken into account. On Friday night, an official VW
statement said the board was convinced that the turnaround point could be
reached this year, provided market conditions did not deteriorate further.
Observers said that statement and Mr Schmidt's broadcast comments yesterday
suggested that the group was backing away from earlier, confident forecasts
that it would break even in 1993.
According to provisional statistics, the Volkswagen group's western European
market share - including sales of the VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques - was
16.1 per cent last month, compared with 17.8 per cent in July 1992.
While total industry sales were down an estimated 21 per cent, deliveries of
VW brands were an estimated 29 per cent lower.
Sales of all General Motors marques, including Opel and Vauxhall, were down
13 per cent and market share was up a provisional 1.2 points at 12.9 per
cent last month.
As sniping between the two groups continued in the row over suspected
industrial espionage, Chancellor Helmut Kohl suggested they should go about
their business and stop the 'highly distasteful' public debate.
Mr Schmidt said both groups would benefit if the dispute was removed from
the headlines, while Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony,
which owns almost 20 per cent of VW, appealed again for peace talks between
VW and Opel, GM's German subsidiary. 'Opel should not keep raising new
obstacles to a sensible and highly-necessary discussion,' his spokesman
said.
Opel has refused all contacts until Mr Schroder and senior VW executives
withdraw allegations of an American plot to damage Volkswagen and of
possible perversion of the course of justice.
According to news agency reports, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's
production director and focus of the spying charges, arranged for the
destruction of 'magazines, clippings and correspondence' a week after he was
employed by VW.
In a statement sent to prosecutors investigating the case, he is reported to
have said he did not return any 'possibly' sensitive papers to GM or Opel
because destruction appeared to him to be the 'surest and conclusive way to
prevent any distribution'.

FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish air crash hits sector's
shares

<TEXT>
SHARES of leading Swedish companies linked to the country's military
aerospace programme fell sharply yesterday after the spectacular crash of a
JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft during an air display over central Stockholm
on Sunday.
The high-profile accident, in front of TV cameras and thousands of
spectators at the city's annual water festival, casts a shadow over the
future of the JAS project - and over Sweden's entire military aerospace
programme. The project was already well behind schedule and over budget.
Shares in Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company, fell hardest,
dropping nearly 5 per cent to SKr139. Investor owns Saab-Scania, which is
the leading participant in the JAS manufacturing consortium along with Volvo
Flygmotor, Ericsson Radar Electronics, and FFV Aerotech (part of the
newly-privatised Celsius group). Volvo's B shares fell SKr7 to SKr439 in
early trading, although they later recovered some ground to end the day at
SKr442. Celsius shares eased SKr2 early on, but closed unchanged at SKr155.
The crash will increase the project's cost - which already exceeds SKr60bn
(Dollars 7.6bn) - and add to the delays caused by the crash of a prototype
JAS aircraft during its development phase in 1989. Only if the latest
accident can be blamed squarely on pilot error will the consortium be able
to avoid further rigorous testing and possible system changes.
'We are looking at a minimum delay of half a year,' said Mr Kjell Gothe,
information officer for Swedish defence minister Anders Bjorck yesterday. He
indicated that the extra costs would be borne by the manufacturers, not the
government, although these would be subject to discussion.
The JAS programme is well advanced, with orders for 140 aircraft from the
Swedish air force already in place. For this reason alone the government is
almost certain to resist calls for the project to be scrapped. Ironically,
the first aircraft to be delivered, amid much pomp and ceremony in June, was
the one which crashed on Sunday.
The greater danger is that the manufacturers will now find it harder to win
the export orders they need to make the JAS programme a commercial success.
Consortium members have said they are aiming for orders for a total of 500
aircraft in the next 10 to 20 years. Although they have never identified
potential export markets, countries in south-east Asia, Latin America, and
central and eastern Europe, have all been mentioned. There was bitter
disappointment last year when the Finnish government opted to buy 57 new
F18s from the US group McDonnell Douglas rather than from the JAS.
Even before Sunday's crash, there were questions as to whether Sweden could
maintain a viable military aerospace industry on its own, for all its
undoubted high technological expertise. Greater emphasis has been placed on
co-operation with foreign groups, and talks have been held with British
Aerospace, Dassault of France, and Germany's Dasa, among a number of US and
European defence companies.
Mr Hans Ahlinder, managing director of the JAS industry group, said he could
not say what impact the crash would have on the aircraft's costs and
delivery schedule until investigators had established the cause of the
accident. Investor also declined to comment, pending the investigation's
outcome.

Over the 12 months ended June 30 net asset value of Mid Wynd International
Investment Trust rose from 280.9p to 362.3p per share.
This increase of 29 per cent was the best for ten years, the managers
reported.
The Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m) loan was repaid in April, the bonds which it
financed having been sold. Since 1990 that exercise had produced a capital
profit of Pounds 800,000 - 16p per share - as well as gains to revenue.
For the year gross investment income came to Pounds 769,000 (Pounds 760,000)
and earnings per share to 7.07p (6.34p). The dividend is again 6p with an
unchanged final of 3.6p.

FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Aspects that may shape investor choice -
The recovery potential of the hotel and leisure sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 70,000 shareholders in Queens Moat Houses and Resort Hotels might be
forgiven for choosing to ignore stock market talk of the recovery potential
in the hotel and leisure sector.
Trading in the shares of the two groups was suspended in March and July
respectively - in each case while their financial positions were examined.
Yet the sector has still managed to outperform the rest of the stock market
for most of the year, buoyed by increasingly bullish research from analysts.
Mr Paul Slattery, at Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, says: 'The strong
share price performances by hotel stocks so far in 1993, in spite of the
horrors of the two suspensions, indicates the extent to which investors have
put their faith in recovery.'
Queens Moat shares were suspended after the group failed to make a Pounds 7m
preference dividend payment. It has since negotiated a standstill of its
Pounds 1bn debts. Only three of the original 16-member board remain as
directors. Resort, meanwhile, has followed Queens Moat's lead and called in
independent accountants to examine its books after concerns arose over what
the company called 'a number of financing and reporting issues'.
The suspension of two of the sector's most visible companies comes at what
many analysts see as the end of one of the industry's most traumatic
periods. As the recession bit, the receiver became the second largest hotel
owner in the country amid a slump in earnings and a jump in debts.
Investors also suffered dividend cuts. Forte, the UK's largest quoted hotel
group, reduced its dividend payment in April for the first time in 20 years.
Despite this, demand for hotel stocks has been growing. However, the
sector's problems have undoubtedly changed investors' stock selection. One
fund manager said that while the recovery potential of the hotel sector was
undeniable, committing funds to it had become more challenging. 'Investors
are now much more sensitive to the quality of management,' he says.
On the other hand, Mr Peter Hilliar at BZW, the stockbroker, believes
investor confidence has been left largely unscathed. He says it is the banks
which are reluctant to return to the sector, having been burdened with
numerous bad debts from bankrupt hotels.
However, evidence of a recovery in the hotel market remains debatable and is
firmly handcuffed to any revival in the domestic economy.
Industry observers suggest that the London market has hardened in the last
quarter. Room demand is some 8 per cent up, although achieved room rates
have fallen slightly as hoteliers offer budget deals to make up the seasonal
shortfall in business users. The combined impact on revenue is moderately
positive, according to one hotel company director. But the same executive
admits that the provinces remain 'flat and soggy'.
Most industry analysts accept that recovery will be sluggish this year,
although London business should be buoyed by an increase in US tourists.
There is also talk of inflation-busting price increases being pushed through
in the 2-star bracket. An industry-wide acceleration in business is
predicted in 1994, with much improved profits being delivered in 1995.
Concluding that the industry 'is facing a better outlook than at any time
over the last four years,' BZW forecasts that earnings for the quoted
hoteliers will grow by 45 per cent this year and 40 per cent the year after,
compared with market averages of 15 and 16 per cent respectively.
Not everyone in the leisure market agrees. Hefty turnover in Forte and
Ladbroke shares on the London market in recent weeks is testimony to a
classic two-way pull, as those looking to buy for the recovery have been met
by a wave of sellers untrusting of the troubled sector.
For instance, a 2 per cent stake in Forte recently sold into the market by
one institution was snapped up by another, pushing turnover to 29m shares in
one day, the highest ever daily volume in Forte shares.
Mr Jason Holden, at NatWest Securities, which last week reiterated its
'sell' advice on Forte, remains cautious over the sector's recovery
prospects. 'We do not doubt that trading profits are set to improve, but the
hotel industry post the recession is going to be fundamentally different to
that of the glory days of the late 1980s. Some in the stock market have not
yet taken this on board.'
The 1980s saw the sector being driven as much by asset price inflation as by
the fundamentals of the hotel business. Many in the market believe that
after the recession, with asset inflation virtually eliminated, investor
attention will shift in favour of other criteria in judging performance.
Most analysts believe that those companies with realistically-valued assets
in their balance sheets will do best. In addition, low-cost business hotels
with strong brands, such as Forte's Travel Lodge and Whitbread's Travel Inn,
are seen as having the best margins against the luxury end of the market.
Added to an experienced and visible management to reassure the more nervous
investor, these are the aspects of the business likely to shape investor
choice.
Stakis, which has taken the pain of over-priced assets in its balance sheet
recently, has crept on to several brokers' 'buy' lists in recent weeks. The
shares, which stood at 111p four years ago, have recovered from their
low-point of 22p some 18 months ago and have climbed to 59p.
Friendly Hotels, which has suffered on the back of Resort's suspension, has
ridden criticisms that its management is not visible enough, and the shares
have also gathered support lately.
Valuation worries continue to surround Forte and Ladbroke, although the
former wins most specialists' vote for its strong brands and management
changes.
Although by no means unanimous, many analysts believe the rebound in Forte's
profits will be strong. Smith New Court, the stockbroker, is forecasting a
more than doubling of profits at Forte over the next two years - a figure it
agrees is 'aggressive'.
However, Smith's Mr Bruce Jones asserts: 'Our estimates may be six months
too early. But the sector is on the turn. The profit bounce potential at
Forte is considerable.'

FT  10 AUG 93 / New faces on the box: Changes in South African broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Authoritarian governments do one thing best: they teach people to take
orders, and to like it. Nowhere is the habit of subservience more damaging
than in the newsroom of the state broadcaster. Until four years ago, few
broadcasters anywhere in the former totalitarian world could rival the South
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) for slavish adherence to the ruling
party line.
Now the SABC has a new chairman who is black, a woman and anything but a
supporter of the National party. In a society which has been moulded almost
as much by male chauvinism as by racial discrimination, the appointment of
Mrs Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri is a seminal event. She will be at the helm of an
institution which has served as a loyal hand maiden to the National party
since it took power in 1948 until the day, four decades later, when it
decided to end apartheid.
Mrs Matsepe-Casaburri will occupy one of the hottest seats in the country.
With South Africa's first multiracial elections expected next year, all
political parties agree that an independent SABC is crucial to a fair poll.
Within months, the corporation is to come under the scrutiny of an
Independent Media Commission, chosen by the parties to constitutional
negotiations, and charged with ensuring fair election coverage.
But there are signs that the SABC itself is preparing, not for independence,
but for a new kind of servitude.
'The king is dead; long live the king.' South African political columnist
Denis Beckett, writing in the Johannesburg Sunday Star, quotes this
well-worn phrase to highlight his worries that SABC staff are already
shifting their allegiance from one political master to another: from the
National party to the ANC. Indeed, they seem to share the country's
confusion over who is really in charge, obeying both masters by turns but
never acting independently.
The coverage of events surrounding the assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the
African National Congress guerrilla leader, was a case in point: SABC
television aired what can only be described as a hagiographical portrait of
Mr Hani - a man demonised by the National party - and allowed the ANC to
dictate some of the coverage surrounding his death.
On the eve of a national day of mourning, SABC agreed to broadcast on
prime-time news a three-minute appeal for calm from Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC
leader. When Mr Mandela delivered an eight-minute pre-recorded video, the TV
editors halved it, to howls of outrage from the ANC, which insisted it be
broadcast again in full. The SABC complied.
SABC editors insist they were acting in the national interest in bowing to
ANC pressure. But as media lawyer Mr David Dison points out, the SABC
understands the national interest to mean the interests of the government of
the day - or in this case the government in waiting.
For in the old South Africa, government always knew best. Prof Gavin
Stewart, head of the school of journalism at Rhodes University, believes
that religion as well as politics conspired to create a sycophantic culture
at the SABC. 'That's built into the Calvinist culture (of the Afrikaner) -
you believe your leaders are ordained by God, and you can't help but pass on
that attitude to the new leaders.'
In any event, the news culture of the SABC has improved since President P W
Botha left office in 1989. He personally interfered in its news coverage on
a regular basis. The ANC and other black political organisations, banned by
Pretoria, were never heard on air.
Since Mr Botha's departure, ANC speakers appear almost nightly, along with
representatives of the far left and right. And SABC staff say they no longer
receive direct telephone calls from the president.
But SABC news continues to reflect undue deference to the presidential
viewpoint. One example, of central importance, was the SABC's coverage of
the appointment of its own new board of governors. The appointment provoked
a political dogfight between the ANC and the government, after President de
Klerk twice vetoed the list of 25 board members recommended by an
independent panel of jurists.
But rather than reflect this dogfight on TV, by pitting Mr de Klerk against
an ANC representative in live debate, SABC chose to give the president an
easy ride from a tame interviewer, who did not even ask the president why he
had vetoed the panel's black nominee as chairman, Professor Njabulo Ndebele,
in favour of a white Afrikaner, who subsequently resigned in protest. Mrs
Matsepe-Casaburri, who was previously deputy chairman, was finally appointed
last week as chairman as a compromise candidate.
But if the president emerged from the SABC board fiasco looking like a brute
 -he forced the replacement of several ANC-leaning nominees by anonymous
Afrikaners of questionable credentials - the ANC looked scarcely better.
Despite the fact that ANC officials had agreed that the president should
have final veto over nominees, they claimed foul play when he used it.
Over time, the board may succeed at building credibility. But no board,
however pure, can revolutionise overnight the culture of an organisation
with 5,000 employees, 22 radio stations, 12.5m radio listeners and 8.8m
daily viewers for its three television channels.
The ANC has called for an 'iron broom' to sweep Afrikaner dominance from
SABC newsrooms; and important changes will need to be made at the top, where
virtually every senior editorial post is held by an Afrikaner male.
The new board has started to address this issue. Affirmative action policies
will be pursued. Priority will be given to blacks in filling top and middle
management posts that fall vacant in the next 18 months.
But it may be easier said than done. With the SABC as monopoly broadcaster
for 57 years, there are few trained broadcasters who did not grow up in the
culture of the SABC.
That monopoly is now expected to end, with the SABC likely to be unbundled.
Commercially viable channels and radio stations could be sold off to private
shareholders by a new government. Political parties have agreed that
broadcasting in the new South Africa would be regulated by a new independent
broadcasting authority, which would allocate many new radio licences to
outside broadcasters, and possibly create a commercial TV channel.
Deregulation will naturally multiply the number of independent news sources,
and reduce the potential for government control.
But broadcasting experts say the market may be too small to support another
commercial television station, meaning the SABC would remain in effective
control of TV. If it remains a monopoly, the risk is that a new government -
faced with the political instability expected to plague the first years of
the new South Africa - would eventually be tempted to abuse the SABC again.
With that in prospect, viewers would do well to enjoy the present Prague
spring; the SABC may never be so free again.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Right step to convergence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof GEORGES DE MENIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The six MIT economists who called for an early burial of the EMS
(Personal View, July 29), bolstered their argument by a dramatic analogy to
the policies of the 1930s. They equated 'hanging on to the D-Mark' in 1993
with 'hanging on to gold' in 1931.
There are, however, many lessons in economic policy to be drawn from the
Great Depression. Surely one of them is that competitive national
devaluations are not an effective path to full employment. What Europe needs
is not to bury the EMS, but to restructure it and restore its efficacy as a
system that encourages policy convergence. The August 1 agreement to widen
the bands could prove to be the first step.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: A better way to save on energy bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF STEPHENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re 'Advance payments could avoid VAT on fuel bills' (August 7), if
energy consumers have cash to spare for such payments they would be far
better advised to spend it on energy efficiency improvements at home - thus
saving themselves far more than the 8 per cent VAT this year, next year, and
for ever more.
An investment of Pounds 1,500 in the right combination of house insulation,
draught proofing, heating controls, low energy lighting and a more efficient
boiler could save a typical householder 30-50 per cent of their energy bills
 -enough to pay the VAT and still have change.
And if all the energy and hot air devoted by populist politicians in
attacking VAT on fuel had been devoted to the cause of energy efficiency,
we'd all be better off, with lower fuel bills and less environmental damage.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Oil's disappearing act: The chancellor's dilemma, an inside
view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One cause of our present borrowing problems that has received too little
attention is the extraordinary and unexpected disappearance of tax revenues.
Some of this can be attributed to the recession. But the recession cannot be
blamed for the reduction in the share of national income that is taken in
tax from 42 1/2 per cent in 1985-86 to 36 per cent predicted in March for
1993-94. That 6 per cent difference is worth over Pounds 35bn. It has made a
significant contribution to the emergence of our Pounds 50bn borrowing
problem.
In a buoyant tax system, where revenue tends to rise and fall more than
proportionally with national income, a recession may reduce the revenue
share. But this explanation cannot account for the decline in the revenue
share since 1985-86, since money incomes (and real incomes) are, despite the
recession, still well above their 1985-86 levels.
No, the most important single cause of the falling revenue share is the 1986
collapse in the oil price and the subsequent decline in oil production. The
resulting loss of revenue was initially disguised by a surge in corporation
tax (and other) revenues in the boom of the late 1980s. It has become
apparent as other sources of revenue, notably corporation tax, have dried up
in the recession of the early 1990s. On this view our present revenue
shortfall is deep-seated and structural.
Oil has gone out of the news, and people now forget that Britain's North Sea
revenues have been the single most important influence on the public
finances since the mid-1970s. They rose from nothing to just under 4 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1984-85, and have since fallen back to
pre-Thatcher levels. There was a virtually instantaneous loss of oil
revenues worth nearly 2 per cent of GDP when the oil price plunged in early
1986. That revenue has never been replaced.
Why did the government not act at once to replace what was (in today's
money) a Pounds 12bn revenue loss? The short answer is they didn't need to
because the great boom of the late 1980s increased the yield of other taxes,
most notably corporation tax. The unexpected increase in corporation tax
revenues from 2 per cent to 4 per cent of GDP covered the loss of oil
revenues for a while. Their equally unanticipated disappearance in the early
1990s recession has now exposed the problem.
The corporation tax roller-coaster is easy to explain with hindsight. The
Lawson reform of 1984 had made the UK tax rate on profits one of the lowest
in the world, and international companies, which always have some discretion
in their internal transfer pricing, chose to take their profits in the UK.
So the UK government, by taxing at a low rate, effectively bid away tax
revenue from other countries. It was a version of Lafferism (low rates
generating high revenues) which worked only as long as other countries
allowed it. Over the years, they have responded by cutting their own
corporation tax rates, and the bonanza has ended.
The Lawson reform also produced a built-in rise and fall in corporation tax
revenues. Cutting the tax rate from 52 per cent to 35 (now 33) per cent was
bound in the long run to reduce the tax yield on a given level of profits.
In the short term, however, the tax cut was phased in slowly, and more than
offset by changing the system of capital allowances. Instead of writing off
investment in a single year, we moved to a 25 per cent reducing balance
system. Initially that produced a sharp fall in the value of allowances (and
rise in the corporation tax yield) but over time, as the value of allowances
has climbed back to its original level, the tax yield has fallen.
A further factor was the increased investment of the late 1980s. That
boosted the total value of allowances, which were carried over into the
recession, enabling companies to set still-large allowances against
shrinking profits. The effect was magnified by the concession made in the
1991 budget, enabling companies to set tax losses against profits earned up
to three years earlier.
The rise in corporation tax revenues clearly contributed to the fiscal
optimism which underpinned the tax cuts of the late 1980s. Its fall in the
early 1990s has aggravated the ensuing deterioration in the public finances.
But if we compare tax revenue this year with the level in 1985-86, the share
of corporation tax is unchanged. Of the 6 percentage point fall in the
government's revenue share since then, two components stand out: the loss of
oil revenues accounts for half the shortfall; income tax and National
Insurance (NI) for another quarter.
These figures underline the central message of this analysis, which is that
today's problems have their origins in a surprisingly distant event, the
1986 collapse in the oil price, a fact that was concealed from us by the
behaviour of corporation tax revenues. They also suggest that the tax cuts
of 1987 and 1988, the NI reform of 1989, and the introduction of Peps,
Tessas and independent taxation for women have eroded income tax revenue to
an extent that now appears unsustainable.
Before leaping to the conclusion that the tax cuts were wrong, we should
remember two salient facts. First, and most surprising, the 6 percentage
point reduction in the tax burden since 1985-86 has only brought it back to
the level that Mrs Thatcher inherited from Labour in 1978-79. The main
energies of the first Thatcher administration were directed to reducing
borrowing, notably by means of the tax increases in the famous 1981 Budget.
That, plus the new oil revenues, secured a 6 point rise in the tax burden in
the first three Thatcher years.
Those tax increases were reversed in the late 1980s against a background of
public spending restraint (the second salient fact) which drove down its
share of GDP from a peak of nearly 47 per cent in 1984-85 to 39 per cent in
1988-89. The loss of oil and income tax revenue did not matter as long as it
was matched by the fall in the public spending ratio.
Today's problems arise because the loss of revenue has proved permanent
while the fall in spending has been reversed. Since it will be difficult to
get spending down again, taxes have to go up. The government's misfortune is
that the revenue from 'invisible' taxes with a low political profile (oil
royalties, Petroleum Revenue Tax, corporation tax) has now to be replaced
with much more visible (and therefore unpopular) tax increases. It is all
part of the process of adapting to life without our North Sea riches, a
theme to which l shall return next week.
The author is former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and was a
special adviser to the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont

FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Expected benefits of Uruguay Round may not
materialise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN HINES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Blackhurst (Letters, August 2) reinforces the uncritical
assertions made by countless commentators and the media that the signing of
the Uruguay Round will result in an income gain of around Dollars 200bn. The
implication is almost that 12 months after the ink is dry the benefits of
such an order will accrue. The reality of the actual study and the opinions
of its critics are very different.
The much quoted Dollars 200bn figure comes from a 40-page OECD study which
the organisation's secretary-general, Jean Claude-Paye, has called a 'pretty
theoretical study'. He was also highly critical of the way the media had
made extensive use of the figure while ignoring the corollary that it would
take ten years to achieve the gains and that some nations, particularly in
the developing world, would be hurt.
In a similarly critical article on the study, the Wall Street Journal quoted
the authors themselves as saying that 'they've been misunderstood and that
people are hoping for the moon'. It has also been admitted that the model
used was not an economic forecast model and so could not answer questions
about what effect the conclusion of the round could have on the current
world recession.
At the end of the day, of course, the real question is not how many computer
guesstimates can you get on a pinhead, but what the actual effects of a
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round will be for the world's
poor, its unemployed and for the environment.
Outside computer programmes and in the real world, people are increasingly
aware that it will make things worse. Their growing response is perhaps best
encapsulated by the Indian slogan of 'Home Rule Not Gatt Rule.'

FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Local efforts too often ignored in delivery of
emergency aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS HINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's review of Jonathan Benthall's book, Disasters, Belief
and the Media (August 6), describes a list of familiar characters who appear
on the scene during news coverage of emergencies overseas. Among 'the hero,
the villain, the dispatcher and the donor' was a striking omission: the
local people.
Local relief workers are almost always the greatest contributors to the
provision of emergency relief. The resources may have to come from outside
(though not always) but those who deliver them on the ground - who drive the
convoys, run the feeding centres, staff the refugee camps and provide health
care - are usually national staff from the country concerned. Even in
Somalia, where national structures have collapsed, relief programmes have
been crucially dependent on brave, committed, qualified Somali staff.
Unfortunately, even the best of the Western media tend to be blind to these
efforts. The 'media construct' described by Mr Benthall is a template
applied without discernment by reporters and editors who 'know' what the
public will identify with - the 'hero' (or, equally, the 'heroine'), a white
Western aid worker replete with agency T-shirt, looking caring and concerned
against the background of starving children or miserable refugees.
The overall impression created is one of helplessness and pathetic
dependence among the local people, contrasted with the active, even
'flamboyant' generosity of Westerners. This can be damaging, not just for
the image of the Third World and its people which the public receives, but
also for its direct consequences for the relief and rehabilitation
programmes.
It encourages a type of aid delivery which donor governments, anxious to be
seen to act swiftly, are increasingly anxious to fund. This is to parachute
Western workers, materials and delivery structures into a foreign country,
ignoring not only the local context but also the local capacity for meeting
the crisis. National professional people, many of them highly trained and
qualified, find they have no influence over an expenditure of massive
resources from outside which may be inappropriately targeted.
When the international agencies depart (not coincidentally, soon after the
last of the TV cameras) nothing will have been done to strengthen the
ability of the local people to go on meeting the needs of a disaster which
may have repercussions lasting many years.
The journalists who cover these situations are compassionate men and women
whose reporting is frequently motivated by humanitarianism. But their hope
that by reporting a need they will produce the right kind of action is often
too simplistically applied. The style and content of the reporting will
influence the style and content of the response. It is time for creative
journalists - and, more importantly, their editors - to break the
disaster-reporting mould and think again.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report 'Roads bring growing tensions to Whitehall' (August 6)
contains a seriously misleading statement about 'traffic fumes'. These were
to be the fastest growing factor in air pollution. The fact is that noxious
vehicle emissions are now declining because of the introduction of catalytic
converters.
This is recognised by the Department of the Environment which, in its
recently issued consultation paper on 'sustainable development', stated that
tighter emission standards introduced in 1993 for new vehicles, together
with tighter checks on older ones, should lead to a steady improvement in
air quality to the end of the century and beyond.

<TEXT>
The four-part series on Genghis Khan and the Mongol empire, Storm From The
East which begins today (9.45) was made after Japan's main broadcaster, NHK,
approached the BBC. The Japanese and the British, we are told, found that
there were 'significant differences in emphasis' in what they wanted to say.
BBC producer Robert Marshall claims 'The Japanese find it very difficult to
be critical about anyone, even Genghis Khan'. So the two scripts differed:
'The BBC's goes into detail on the conquests and massive slaughter involved
while the Japanese concentrate more on anthropology and the countryside'.
The mind boggles.
The shift towards real-life crime as entertainment continues rapidly. Inside
Crime is yet another series which promises to combine analysis with 'reconst
ructions'. Today's opening episode (7.30 ITV) will reconstruct the mugging
of Frederick Carter who died a week after being attacked in a lift. Won't
that be nice.
In Far Flung Floyd the leader of the gastronauts moves on to West Malaysia
(8.30 BBC2).

FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Playful studies in ambiguity - 'Pictures in Pictures'
at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The play within the play, the book or poem within the book, or poem, is an
ancient literary ploy by which the writer may stand back from the work that
engages him, to see it at an arm's length. The visual equivalents of such
things are common enough: paintings are to be found in painters' studios, on
patrons' walls and church altars and we take them, perhaps, as read; yet
they are no less rich than drama or poetry in suggestive possibilities,
complex or blindingly obvious as they may be.
Not unreasonably, the second of the National Gallery's agreeably didactic
series on pictorial themes and variations, illustrated from its own
collections, is given over to them. At some 26 works the show is small, but
wide enough in range, from Massys, Christus and Bellini to Degas and
Cezanne, to make its several points.
Does it make a shade too much of them? Paintings were ever ambiguous things,
yet their study does seem to attract the more literal-minded among us, and
here they make holiday. A joke explained, after all, is no joke, and an
irony worried over instead of savoured lightly is an irony worried to death.
The self-portrait is as ambiguous a subject as any, the purest solipsism,
artist remaking himself as object, image, art. And here is Murillo at his
most virtuoso, painting himself within a painted frame within the frame,
save only that his hand emerges to grasp that second, internal frame, as it
were to frame the joke. It is the nicest double-take, and should be left at
that.
Here too is the splendidly ambiguous portrait by Lotto of a Venetian lady in
her finery, jewels at her breast, her sleeves richly slashed, who holds
before her a drawing of the virtuous Lucretia. Do we really need to agonise
over the question of whether she herself was truly virtuous, or quite
otherwise? Not really. More reasonable is the iconographical reading of the
two Vermeers, of women respectively standing and sitting at the virginals,
the one in a cool, pure morning light, the other in a richer, darker
interior. The one stands before a Cupid who holds up a single card, the
other sits before an identifiable genre brothel scene. Both engage the
viewer directly, the one with a quizzical, the other a more inviting gaze.
The point is there to be taken.
In Hogarth's 'Marriage a la Mode' suite, such moralising is quite overt,
gleefully, maliciously so, images of classical rape, conventional piety and
low life at its grossest variously set to point the vicious satire, as the
Earl and his Countess sink by stages into the abyss. But even here the hints
and references, though often quite particular in themselves, are marginal to
the central narrative, wilfully half-masked or hidden in the shadows, as
though little more than private jokes on the artist's part, the onus on us
to notice them at all.
Is that, after all, as it still should be? I was certainly grateful to have
pointed out to me, in the great Canaletto of the festive procession from the
church of San Rocco, what might be Canaletto himself at the back of the
crowd, seizing the moment to show off his own painting, opportunistically
hung along with those of his contemporaries on the facade of the
neighbouring Scuola, to prospective clients. The youthful Cezanne, too,
takes as his subject one of his own works, or rather its stretcher, the
canvas turned face to the wall and stacked behind the studio stove. Boilly's
grisaille of a girl at a window is a virtuoso performance, presenting his
own painting as though it were a print, margin, mount and all.
But the most charming category of work is at once the most natural and the
least minatory or moralistic. Artists have painted artists at work since
ever they worked together in shared studios, or models were persuaded to sit
to them. Grouped around the life model or still life, it is easy enough for
the artist's attention to shift to the colleague, pupil or apprentice
engrossed in the common matter at hand.
Vaillant's youth sits drawing from the cast after Michaelangelo: Metsu
considers, with the greatest tenderness, a young woman as she addresses
herself to a still-life spread out across a table. Saint Luke, in the
character of Flemish master-painter sits at his easel in his studio, palette
in hand, his materials on the stool beside him, his symbolic ox, as it might
be his dog at his feet. It is by a follower of Massys . . . and of the
master himself? Perhaps - but who can say?

FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Elusive 'Mrs Dalloway' - Cleveland Lyric Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creating an opera out of Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs Dalloway is a bit like
trapping a cloud in order to make ice cubes: the material is there, for
sure, but the process changes it out of all recognition. And there are
easier sources of water. Nevertheless, Bonnie Grice, a radio journalist,
insisted that the thing could be done, and managed to persuade first Michael
McConnell, the director of Cleveland Lyric Opera, then Libby Larsen, the
destined composer. A few years later, with a libretto duly supplied by Ms
Grice, the piece provided this small, game company with its first
full-length world premiere.
Of course it was impossible. Plot in Mrs Dalloway is less important than
character, and character considerably less important than method. What
matters in the book is the sense of the simultaneity of unrelated things -
simultaneity of thoughts, events, purposes and flash moments, to all of
which the narrative is mysteriously privy as it froths and bubbles on, a
superior gossip. One can imagine a Mrs Dalloway symphony - the book itself
seems to mimic symphonic form with its recurrent themes, distinct movements
and passages of development - but not a Mrs Dalloway opera. No wonder a
composer friend told Ms Larsen to steer clear.
Instead she went on and did a workmanlike job. By the evidence of her output
 -which includes four other operas, as well as buckets of symphonies,
chamber music and choral items, all from the last two decades - she is a
workmanlike composer. Ms Grice's libretto provided a sentimental reunion
(that of Clarissa Dalloway and Peter Walsh), a sentimental memory (of Sally
Seton) and a sentimental melodrama (the suicide of Septimus Warren Smith,
while his wife is arguing with his doctor). All of these Ms Larsen dutifully
set, without any particular show of enthusiasm, for soloists accompanied by
a small band with prominent percussion and electronic keyboards. The right
buttons were pressed: expressionism and eeriness for Septimus, waltzes for
love remembered and regretted, neoclassicism for civilisation, contortions
of 'God Save the Queen' for England. There was nothing wrong with any of it,
and nothing right.
The presence of so many reflective solos suggested that Ms Grice's
conviction about the idea sprang from the misconception that a book of
memory would lend itself to being told through aria. It failed to work
because the pace of operatic reflection is so much slower than that of
Woolf's prose, and because, without the narrative voice to rush and connect
and poeticise, what these people have to say is trivial. Even the
counterpointing of the two main threads - Clarissa's life of poignant
recollection and Septimus's imprisonment in memories of the Great War - was
trivialised by being overstated, and by being baldly cut free from the wash
of other characters and incidents the book needs for its tone and its
technique.
The title character became a rather frail and neurotic creature, perhaps for
reasons that had to do less with Mary Elizabeth Poore's performance than
with the transmutation. If you have to sing to yourself about how wonderful
life is, then things must be pretty bad. If you have only Ms Larsen's music
with which to do it, you might as well take Septimus's escape route. In the
opera, though, Septimus was a force, as musical madmen tend to be, and Gary
Briggle was striking in the part: a strong lyric tenor with the rough grate
of frayed emotions in his voice.
Mr McConnell's first reaction to Ms Grice's importuning was to counter that
the book was a film, not an opera. However, Steven Perry's set - an interior
with great curves and azure paint suggesting Paris rather than Westminster -
offered little opportunity for the dissolves and cross-cuttings that the
words and music were trying to realise.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Weir and Saxton - New music at the Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judith Weir is unquestionably one of the most individual voices in British
music today, composer of two widely acclaimed operas (the first, A Night at
the Chinese Opera, almost a paradigm of what opera in the late 20th century
can be), and an array of sharply focused, always fresh and original concert
works. Yet her output so far contains relatively little orchestral music -
only the chamber-sized Isti Mirant Stella (1981) has real substance and
engagement.
In Thursday's Prom Martyn Brabbins conducted the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra in the London premiere of Weir's Music, Untangled from 1991. It
was part of a curiously assorted programme that began with the Pas de Six
from Britten's Prince of the Pagodas and Dvorak's Cello Concerto (Sophie
Rolland the less than assertive soloist) and ended with Prokofiev's Seventh
Symphony. Weir takes a Scottish folk melody and projects it through a series
of transformations which are always oblique and teasing. The whole bustling
process only lasts about eight minutes, though this, evidently, was a new
enlarged version, and the music brings echoes of Janacek (in the jump-cut
transitions) and Tippett (of Midsummer Marriage and Sellinger's Round mode).
As so often with Weir the music itself exudes no positive personality. The
charm, skill and distinction in her work stems much more from the artful
arrangements of the musical objects than from the flavour of the invention;
the constantly diverting contexts, the unexpected continuities make up the
expressive palette. Her method is at its most captivating in a theatrical
context - hence the success of the operas and the tours de force of pieces
like King Harald's Saga, where narrative conceits can be mixed in; it is
much harder to bring off in the more or less abstract world of an orchestral
piece. Music, Untangled is an effective concert filler, but Weir's eventual
breakthrough as an orchestral composer will require a much broader, more
ambitious canvas.
*****
Robert Saxton's strongly imagined, coherent and continuously vivid Viola
Concerto came to the Proms the following evening - this was the work's first
London performance, seven years after its 1986 Cheltenham premiere. A 'face
in the crowd' image is the nub of its argument: Saxton constantly places the
viola, which he describes as 'the most human instruments', at odds with a
small orchestra expertly used to convey menace - hard-edged, coolly bated,
or darkly immanent as may be, but always sharply contrasted in tone with the
eloquently 'human' utterances of the soloist.
Though Saxton does not specify the point, one might go further and divine in
the work's alienated drum-patterings, chilling piano arabesques and
occasional harshly squealing high clarinets an 'urban' subtext. The
influence of Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin, that most extreme of 20th-century
musical cityscapes, is everywhere: the dramatic contrasts of mood afford the
music a graphic quality of which Bartok would not have been at all ashamed.
He might also admired the formal orderliness of Saxton's four (linked)
movements, in which the traditional demands of concerto form and a
thoroughly modern sense of timbre and texture are smoothly reconciled.
In a way, there is something even a bit 'pat' about the composer's smoothing
over of joins, sanding away of all rough edges - Saxton's later orchestral
works are bolder, freer with form. But the concerto is so assured, so
gripping for the listener, and plainly so rewarding for a violist of Paul
Silverthorne's calibre to play (he was the work's inspirer and first
soloist), that this hardly counts as serious criticism. No less plainly, the
City of London Sinfonia under Richard Hickox were roused by it - as they had
been, earlier in the concert, by Nicholas Daniel's gloriously witty, urbane,
technically breathtaking account of the Strauss Oboe Concerto, but as they
had not been by Rossini (Turk in Italy Overture, leaden) or Wolf (Italian
Serenade, stodgy).

FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Verdi and Britten - Bath and Wessex Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City of Bath Opera, launched two years ago, is now more grandly re-titled
Bath and Wessex Opera, and its activities are expanding apace. All this week
in the Bath Theatre Royal there are alternating performances of La traviata
and The Turn of the Screw: this is the first attempt to put on two operas at
one go.
The stated aims of this small company - most ambitious of the many 'private'
opera enterprises that have recently sprung up, founded by the
producer-designer John Pascoe and the conductor Klaus Donath - are
'international' casting and productions faithful to the letter of the text.
Both were embodied in the Verdi, sung in the original language, yet it was
hardly the result of their combination that made the performance so
peculiarly affecting.
It was, rather, the acquisition of one of the world's tiny handful of 'real'
Violettas currently before the public, Nelly Miricioiu. This soprano, a
Romanian now resident in this country for more than a decade, has for some
strange reason never arrived at an established position of eminence in
British opera that such great and special gifts should assure her. All of
our opera intendants ought to drop in on the Theatre Royal this week, to
remind themselves how Verdi singing of Mediterranean intensity, colour and
musical grace, can sound.
We have had much of other kinds in recent times, but this abundant,
intensely italianate kind has been a particular rarity. Miricioiu's
Violetta, as Londoners will recall from her moving 1984 ENO portrayal (in
good English) at the Coliseum, is achieved upon a wonderfully full, free yet
fine-spun delivery of the singing line. Her control of portamento phrasing,
tapering of dynamics (with soft high shadings of exquisite delicacy) and
generously vibrant emotional attack are all characteristics of a noble
tradition in the role - a tradition exemplified by fewer and fewer singers,
which is why this particular exemplar deserves to be cherished.
She is a touching actress, who fits into Pascoe's cleverly designed costumes
and David Myerscough-Jones's romantic scene-perspectives with easy
authority, and who creates a relationship with Gordon Wilson's Alfredo
(youthfully handsome, vocally callow but sensitive) in which all the basic
points - illness, passionate response, awareness of age difference, access
of moral courage, extremes of pathos and poignancy - are made without resort
to outlandish or strenuously original effects.
In the Theatre Royal the constant glow of her womanly warmth made up for
much that was less satisfying around it. Pascoe's production, traditional in
the less distinguished sense, and Donath's stolid conducting of the
Bournemouth Sinfonietta (fearfully loud on occasion) suggested rather too
often that this Traviata was international-opera-by-numbers, not an
artistically serious ensemble performance. David Barrell's drily eloquent
Germont senior and Penelope Walker's Flora regularly raised the tone; but
the divertissement at Flora's party, complete with four Chippendale-style
body-builders decked with bulls' horns and Marion Tait and David Morse from
the Birmingham Royal Ballet as guest-appearance dancers, lowered it
considerably.
From this to the remarkably inventive Britten performance the following
evening was a reassuring move in the right direction. No 'international'
names, perhaps, but notable British singing-actors - Janis Kelly
(Governess), Nigel Robson (Prologue and Quint), Enid Hartle (Mrs Grose),
Sarah Pring (Miss Jessel) - who with telling accuracy and subtlety lock into
their roles. The children, Paula Bishop as Flora and Ben Sutcliffe as Miles,
are among the most troublingly vivid I have seen and heard: nervously alert,
vocally true, quicksilver in their manipulation of governess and
housekeeper.
Roger Vignoles, a celebrated recital-pianist now building an additional
career as an opera-conductor, focuses the musical tensions with unforced
tautness: in terms of an intimate yet dramatically forceful projection of
this astonishingly spare, fertile opera-score there can be few better
theatres in the country in which to play, sing or indeed hear The Turn of
the Screw. With a precise, always subtly motivated use of a few curtains -
underscored by side mirror-panels and trailing scarves for the ghosts - the
producer, Paula Fuchs, and designers, Mr Myerscough-Jones and Andrea Carr,
create layers of illusion, fantasy and dream through which the spectator
moves as if spellbound.

FT  10 AUG 93 / People: Union Discount in search of new lease of life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Blunden, who took over as chief executive of Union Discount a year
ago, is bringing in Ian Martin, formerly of Baring Securities, as his new
group managing director.
George Lynn, who is leaving at the end of the year, will also hand over the
group finance function to Martin in the next few months.
While Union's recent troubles have largely stemmed from its disastrous
expansion into leasing, Blunden stresses that his parting with 38-year-old
Lynn is perfectly amicable.
'He is very much a leasing director and he said some time ago he wanted to
pursue opportunities elsewhere. But I asked him not to leave while we went
through the trials and tribulations of last winter.'
Union was in takeover talks from last autumn until the spring when it
succeeded in selling Winterflood Securities, which makes markets in smaller
companies.
Now Blunden is still eager to retain Lynn's advice as the group unwinds its
leasing business over coming months.
Lynn had spent ten years at Union, the last four as finance director and
previously worked for Baltic, the leasing group.
Meanwhile Martin, who is a chartered accountant, will be Blunden's
'extremely active number two', particularly involved in the evaluation of
new business. 'I am absolutely useless at accounts' says the one-time SG
Warburg bond dealer.
Martin, 41, had been group finance director of County NatWest for two years
from 1985 before moving to Baring Securities as chief operating officer
responsible for group finance, operations and administration.
He subsequently took charge of the group's derivatives trading, sales and
research, an area which Union is itself keen to develop. Martin stepped down
when Baring Securities chief Christopher Heath resigned in March.
'Not a bad start for poor old Union Discount,' says Blunden who wants to
retore the discount house's battered reputation by making it known as 'a
place where bright people come'. Last month the group acquired 51 per cent
of risk management consultancy Guildhall, set up by Craig Kersey, the former
head of fixed income trading and risk management from Mitsubishi Finance and
George Nianias, former head of quantitative fixed income research at SG
Warburg.

FT  10 AUG 93 / People: Inspiring fear from the Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Foot is only 46 yet he has already had 11 jobs in 24 years and is
about to become one of the most feared officials in the City when he takes
over as head of banking supervision at the Bank of England at the end of the
month.
Like many of the Bank of England's high-fliers, Foot (pictured left) started
life as an economist. Having graduated from Cambridge with an upper second,
he had six years in the Bank followed by a year at Yale. His early career at
the Bank included working for Professor Charles Goodhart, when the latter
was advising on monetary policy.
A stint as personal assistant to Eddie George, who took over as governor at
the end of June, gave the first hint that Foot was destined for high office.
It was followed by a series of jobs including being the UK alternate
director at the IMF during the Mexican debt crisis and taking over as head
of foreign exchange division when sterling was uncapped from the D-Mark.
Since September 1990 Foot has headed the Bank's European division and spent
much of his time preparing for the financial side of the Maastricht treaty.
However, Foot admits that the challenge of heading the 200-strong bank
supervision division is more daunting, especially given the recent criticism
of the Bank's role as supervisor of the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
Whilst acknowledging his own lack of supervisory experience, he is conscious
that the 500 institutions he will be supervising expect one thing above all
else, and that is consistent treatment.
As a career Bank of England official, he is also sensitive to criticism that
his views might suffer from being too inbred and promises to compensate for
this by getting out and about much more.
Foot, who takes over from Roger Barnes, will also have a new deputy, Carol
Sergeant, 40, (pictured right) who is also a Cambridge graduate. Since 1990
she has been senior manager for operations and policy in the gilt-edged and
money markets division.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Compensation limits unlawful -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK rules restricting the amount of compensation available to victims of sex
discrimination are unlawful, the European Court of Justice ruled last week
in the second Marshall case.
Miss Helen Marshall, a dietician, had been dismissed by her employer, the
Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority, on the grounds
that she had passed state pension age. In 1986 the European Court ruled that
because state pension ages were different for men and women, her dismissal
was discriminatory and illegal.
The issue the court had to decide in the second case was the level of
compensation to which she was entitled. Under the UK's Sex Discrimination
Act, compensation at the time was limited to Pounds 6,250. An industrial
tribunal assessed Miss Marshall's financial loss at Pounds 18,405, including
Pounds 7,710 in interest. The Area Health Authority paid the capital sum,
but appealed against the interest.
The Court first analysed the objective of the sex discrimination provisions
in the relevant EC directive. It held that the purpose of the provisions was
to put into effect in member states the principle of equal treatment for men
and women in employment.
It then reiterated that the particular provision that prohibited sex
discrimination was of direct effect, and could be relied on by an individual
against a state authority acting as an employer.
As to the provision in the directive that put member states under a duty to
take all necessary measures to enable persons who considered themselves
wronged by discrimination to pursue their claims before the courts, the
Court said that the measures in question had to be such as to guarantee real
and effective judicial protection and have a real deterrent effect on the
employer.
This meant that the particular circumstances of each breach should be taken
into account and, in the event of discriminatory dismissal, a situation of
equality could not be restored without either reinstating the victim or,
alternatively, granting financial compensation for the loss and damage
suffered.
In the light of this, the Court held that fixing an upper limit on
compensation breached the provision in the Council directive relating to the
member states' obligation to guarantee real and effective judicial
protection, because such an action necessarily limited the amount of
compensation to a level which might not reflect the actual loss and damage
suffered in each case.
The Court also held that interest must be capable of being awarded, as
compensation must be full and had to take account of factors, such as the
passage of time, which might reduce its value.
Finally, the Court held that the fact that member states were entitled to
choose between different solutions to achieve the objective of guaranteeing
real and effective judicial protection, did not prevent that provision from
being directly effective.
C-271/91: Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health
Authority, ECJ FC, August 2 1993
Italian rules on foreign language assistants unlawful
The European Court has ruled that an Italian law restricting contracts for
foreign language assistants to renewable one-year periods was contrary to
the Rome treaty's provisions on the free movement of workers.
The law in question only applied to foreign language assistants and not to
other teachers. The Court found that, although the law applied independently
of nationality, it applied essentially to nationals from other member
states, as only 25 per cent of all foreign language assistants in Italy were
Italian.
It was argued that the rules were necessary to ensure that numbers of
assistants matched the annual needs of the universities. The Court held that
the EC provisions did not stop member states from adopting indirectly
applicable measures aimed at resource management as long as such measures
are proportionate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The incredible shrinking headquarters of Imperial Chemical Industries
continues to slim with the retirement of Trevor Harrison, general manager of
planning, and the decision to abolish his post.
Other general managers' positions have also disappeared in recent months
including those of Derek Rushton, in charge of external relations, and Brian
Hines, responsible for insurance and investments.
Harrison, a 54 year old chartered accountant, was with ICI 28 years and
plans to use his retirement to travel, garden, play squash and improve his
golf handicap which he says he has not taken seriously enough in the past.
John Dewhurst, presently acquisitions manager will become group planning and
acquisitions manager, heading up the now much smaller planning department.
He will report to Colin Short, finance director, who assumes board
responsibility for planning and acquisitions.
In a separate move, Chris Hampson, one of the main board directors will take
responsibility from next month for the regional businesses. Under him will
be Ian Macfarlane, regional executive, who is also taking over as head of
regional businesses in south east Asia. Based in London, he is also
responsible for Argentina.
As part of the restructuring of the Asian-Pacific organisation, Paul
Schindler, chairman ICI China, is moving to Allied Signal, the US company,
to become senior vice-president international.
The colourful John Chandler, managing director ICI Taiwan and a fluent
Mandarin speaker, takes on Schindler's role, while keeping his former
position.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Record Canadian fine imposed for
market-sharing pact - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In June, Canadian competition authorities imposed the largest ever fine
against a single firm when it fined Chemagro, a subsidiary of Bayer AG,
CDollars 2m for two separate market-sharing agreements. As well as
confirming the trend in Canada towards increasingly high fines for antitrust
conspiracy, the case highlights the importance of Canadian rules against
foreign-directed, anti-competitive agreements, and the Canadian competition
bureau's whistle-blowing programme.
The first conspiracy involved an unlawful agreement between Bayer and a
Japanese company for their Canadian subsidiaries to share the Canadian
market for certain chemical insecticides between 1982 and 1988.
The second conspiracy involved a 1990 market-sharing agreement between
Chemagro and Abbott Laboratories, which came to light when Abbott
voluntarily reported it in return for immunity from prosecution. Chemagro is
the first company convicted in Canada of a foreign-directed antitrust
conspiracy.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Competition on back burner - The UK
cannot afford further delays to reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-awaited reform of the UK's competition laws is looking increasingly
unlikely during the next parliamentary session.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which would shepherd such a bill
through Parliament, seems to have its hands full with the prime minister's
much vaunted deregulation bill to cut red tape, the privatisation of British
Coal and reform of trademarks law.
Yet the case for reform of the restrictive trade practices legislation
appears to be stronger now than when first promised by the government in
1987. The European Commission is calling on national courts to take over the
handling of routine competition cases - a move that would require the
convergence of competition rules within Europe as a whole.
A timely reminder of the need for change was given to the UK government last
week, when the Institute of Economic Affairs published a series of lectures
given last year at the London Business School on the most important issues
in regulation, and in particular by the lecture by Sir Gordon Borrie, former
director-general of fair trading.
Sir Gordon's starting point was that UK competition law remains
unnecessarily complex. There are four basic statutes: the 1971 Fair Trading
Act, the 1976 Restrictive Trade Practices Act, the 1976 Resale Prices Act
and the 1980 Competition Act, handling mergers, anti-competitive practices
and other forms of monopolistic behaviour, cartels and resale price
maintenance.
Each of these is dealt with by different procedures involving a combination
of four authorities: the director-general of fair trading, the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, the trade and industry secretary and the Restrictive
Practices Court.
Only resale price maintenance is automatically prohibited (except in
relation to books and pharmaceuticals). Everything else is subject to
case-by-case examination, and an anti-competitive practice or situation can
only be prohibited or modified if, following investigation, it is found to
be against the 'public interest'.
This 'nebulous concept', Sir Gordon said, set the UK's competition laws
apart from those of most other countries, including those of the European
Community.
To add to the complex mosaic faced by UK industry, EC competition law -
article 85 of the Rome treaty dealing with anti-competitive agreements and
article 86 dealing with abuse of market power - is directly applicable in
the UK when inter-state trade is affected.
Growing levels of international trade and the globalisation of markets mean
EC law has an increasing impact in the UK. It also points to the need not
only for closer co-operation between competition authorities, but, more
importantly, to the need for convergence in national laws and enforcement
policies.
Sir Gordon argued that the most obvious and urgent need for reform was in
the restrictive trade practices legislation. An effective means of
controlling price-fixing cartels and market-sharing agreements, bid rigging
and collusive tendering was essential, he said, adding: 'Frankly, the
restrictive trade practices act is not up to the task.'
The defects in the legislation are well known. The act requires parties to
any agreement in which two or more of them accept restrictions on their
commercial freedom, to provide details of the agreement to the Office of
Fair Trading for registration. If they do not, the agreement will be
unlawful. But this registration requirement catches a large number of
agreements that have no significant effect on competition.
The second weakness is that the OFT has inadequate investigatory powers.
When the OFT suspects an unregistered agreement is in operation, all it can
do is issue a notice requiring details of any registrable agreements. It has
virtually no means of proceeding in the face of denials, even where it
continues to have strong suspicions.
The third defect is that the legislation lacks deterrent effect. There are
no financial penalties for failure to comply with the registration
requirement. Companies operating anti-competitive agreements do face
unlimited fines for contempt of court if they break an order of the
Restrictive Practices Court, but in practice fines for contempt in cartel
cases have been modest.
Having promised reform of the law in its election manifesto six years ago,
the government produced a white paper in July 1989 outlining a change in the
law.
Anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices would be automatically
prohibited unless they met specific criteria for an exemption, with heavy
fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover for wilful or flagrant breach of the
law. The OFT would be given tough new investigatory powers, including the
right to enter premises and search for evidence of a suspected agreement.
The proposals met with widespread approval - even from industry, which saw
advantages in the closer alignment of EC and UK law.
But the white paper dealt with only half the problem. As Sir Gordon pointed
out, if the OFT was to be given new powers to investigate and tackle
restrictive trade agreements, it seemed odd to retain the existing laws and
procedures for dealing with abuse by individual companies of their dominance
in the marketplace to stifle competition. The problems with the existing law
were similar to the defects identified in the restrictive trade practices
legislation: weak deterrence, no rights to damages or interim relief and
inadequate powers of investigation.
The government appeared to accept this argument and, last November,
published a consultation paper on reform of the law on abuse of market
power. It canvassed views on three options, two of which involved adopting
an EC-style article 86 prohibition on abuse of a dominant position, backed
by fines.
In April this year, however, it opted to retain the existing case-by-case
approach for tackling anti-competitive practices. The OFT's investigatory
powers are to be strengthened, so that it can decide more quickly whether to
launch full-scale inquiries.
The government had identified a number of serious defects in UK monopoly
controls, and had originally favoured adopting a new system based on article
86 of the Rome treaty while retaining the UK's existing powers to
investigate monopolies under the Fair Trading Act. Sir Gordon had also
favoured this approach.
Its change of mind was ascribed to pressure from industry which was opposed
to the idea of fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods too
cheaply and refusing to supply certain outlets.
As a result, defects in UK competition laws remain and need to be addressed,
if the UK is not to find itself increasingly out of step in Europe. The
publication of Sir Gordon's views will remind the government that it cannot
afford to let things drift.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Back on the rollercoaster
 -Charles Batchelor answers questions arising from the ERM's downfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and Italian companies have had 10 months to become used to more
widely fluctuating currencies since their countries' enforced departure from
the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
The effective dismantling of the ERM on August 2 has meant companies
throughout Europe must now cope with greater currency volatility.
What action should I take to minimise foreign currency risks?
You must take more care in managing your income and expenditure from
activities in the ERM countries. Previously companies could be relaxed about
surpluses or deficits emerging in their cash flows within Europe. The narrow
fluctuation bands between the different currencies meant companies could
usually ignore any exposure which occurred between them.
But now that most of the European currencies can fluctuate quite widely
against others, companies must consider hedging their exposures in
individual currencies. A surplus in D-Marks can no longer be offset by a
deficit in French francs. The D-Mark and the Dutch guilder are retaining
their narrow bands but these are the only two currencies which you can now
set off against each other.
Similarly, if you borrowed D-Marks, for example, to finance export business
on the assumption that the German currency would not fluctuate much against
the other currencies, you must now take into account the risk of greater
volatility.
Is that all?
No. If you are an exporter to, say, Germany or the Netherlands and you have
competitors based in, for example, France, a decline of the French franc
will give them an advantage in the German or Dutch markets. You may need to
think about marketing and pricing issues.
You must also take into account the effect of possible interest rate cuts in
continental Europe. If countries which were previously obliged to maintain
high interest rates to keep their currencies within the tight ERM bands
start cutting their rates, your competitors will have access to cheaper
finance. You could switch your borrowings into the same currency but this
may not always be convenient.
Since I am not involved in exports, can I ignore the possibility of larger
currency movements?
It is a common misconception that dealing only in your domestic market means
you are not exposed to foreign currency risk. You may be exposed to
currency-related developments elsewhere. If a competitor who sells into your
home market buys his raw materials from suppliers in a country with a
currency which has weakened against your currency then that competitor will
enjoy a cost advantage.
I do not believe that even the experts can forecast foreign exchange market
fluctuations, so hedging is a complete waste of time. I might as well let
the pluses and the minuses even themselves out. Is this true?
No. Just because swings in exchange rates are large and unpredictable, that
does not mean you should ignore them in the hope that they will cancel each
other out. To hedge currency flows may not result in higher profits overall,
but it does at least cut down on uncertainty. In the very long term,
movements in exchange rates may follow the real economy, although the timing
and the extent of the movements are so uncertain that companies punt on
exchange rate fluctuations at their peril.
I both sell my products and buy raw materials throughout Europe. Does the
ERM break-up mean I must increase my hedging and, as a result, my financing
costs?
Not necessarily. You may have a natural hedge if you have assets and
liabilities in the same currency which can be matched. You may be able to
match overseas borrowings with revenue flows or set raw materials purchases
against sales in the same country. The advantage of a natural hedge is that
it is cost-free and simple to manage.
Does this mean that I should take out cover for every transaction which does
not have a natural hedge?
Again, not necessarily. You must consider if the exposure is sufficient to
warrant taking out cover. Sensible companies hedge selectively.
Hedging everything in sight can sometimes be a disadvantage. If, for
example, a British company bought foreign currency forward to hedge the
value of a shipment from, say, France and the franc fell against sterling
you would be locked into the earlier, disadvantageous exchange rate.
Competitors who had not hedged could take advantage of the lower rate. This
emphasises the need for a selective approach to currency hedging.
I find foreign exchange market jargon confusing. I have heard of currency
forward contacts, swaps and options. What is the difference?
A forward contract allows a company to 'fix' an exchange rate until payment
is made months or even two or more years later. A drawback is that you will
have to accept or supply the currency involved when the contract matures,
even if the delivery did not go ahead.
Option forward contracts are similar but allow a range of settlement dates
rather than a single date. This gives flexibility but does cost more.
Currency swaps allow a company to swap its debts through a bank with another
company so that both sides obtain a debt in their desired currency. The swap
arrangement sets the rate at which the currencies will be exchanged at a
date in the future.
Currency options give you the right to buy or sell the agreed amount of
currency at a future date. But unlike forward contracts there is no
obligation to complete the deal and if a sale falls through or the
currencies do not move as expected you can simply let the option lapse.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Weighed down by maternity
benefits - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federation of Small Businesses, the largest UK small firms lobby group
with 58,000 members, has reacted angrily to government suggestions that
responsibility for paying state maternity benefits should be transferred to
employers.
At present employers can reclaim in full from the Department of Social
Security the cost of paying maternity benefits, but the federation fears the
government may seek to make employers responsible for part of the cost. In
1991 employers were made responsible for paying 20 per cent of statutory
sick pay benefits.
Reduction or abolition of the right to reclaim maternity payments could lead
to the closure of small businesses, the federation said.
Simply administering various state benefits places a heavy burden on small
firms, it commented.

A quarter of a million small firms which lease or rent business premises are
locked into upward-only rent agreements, according to the latest
NatWest/Small Business Research Trust survey*.
Of these, half have three or more years remaining on their lease before they
can surrender it or leave without sub-letting. As interest rates, inflation
and rents come down small businesses trapped in agreements which do not
permit reductions in rent levels are at a big disadvantage, NatWest said.
Rent accounts for an average 5.5 per cent of the sales of small businesses
while business rates account for a further 2.3 per
cent.

advice - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected shortly to announce plans for a pilot programme
linking the loan guarantee scheme to business advice and counselling
provided by local Training and Enterprise Councils.
Managers and business owners seeking a loan will be invited to take some
form of business training. The loan guarantee scheme guarantees 85 per cent
of bank loans to businesses which lack a track record or the security
normally required.
The pilot programme will allow the government to discover whether companies
which elect to take advice perform better than those which do not. If they
do, linking loans to training could be a means of reducing losses from the
scheme.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Watch those freebies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many companies are offering unnecessary discounts in a misguided attempt to
increase sales and may be needlessly sacrificing a large share of their
profits. This is the finding of a survey* carried out by Winkler Marketing,
a consultancy.
Most of the time companies do not know how much money they are giving away
in discounts or even which members of staff are doing the most damage to
profits.
'When companies run checks on who gives the money away they are often
astonished by how many staff, particularly junior staff, are involved and
disbelieve their own figures when they see how much money is involved,'
comments John Winkler, managing director.
Small companies, in particular, allow themselves to be browbeaten into
offering discounts for fear of losing a customer. Large companies are less
likely to give in to pressure for discounts but are most likely to demand it
from their own suppliers.
A survey of more than 500 managers showed that companies could increase
their sales by an average of 16 per cent if they insisted on sticking to
their published price list. Since most companies make a net profit of
between 6 and 10 per cent they may be giving away between two and three
times their profits in special deals, Winkler calculates.
Financial controllers should take a sample of invoices and analyse any
discounts, rebates and special prices including any advertising or promotion
allowances, the survey suggests. The analysis should reveal which products
are most frequently discounted, which sales executive is involved and who
the customers are.
A handful of deals should be looked at in depth to compare delivery notes
with orders and invoices. Sometimes free goods and extras are not recorded
on the invoice though they have been delivered. Free services such as
delivery, drawings and technical support should also be taken into account,
the survey notes.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: That 'vision thing' again - Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO needs technology 'vision'? Certainly not International Business
Machines, according to Lou Gerstner, the computer giant's tough new chairman
and chief executive.
'The last thing IBM needs is vision,' he declared last month, in a statement
that is stirring widespread debate throughout the computer industry.
The 'vision thing' is a hot topic among those who like to wax lyrical about
their views on the path that technology developments will take in coming
years; 'information highways' and 'industry convergence' are their favourite
topics. All seem to see their companies playing a critical role as these
visions unfold.
Yet apart from drumming up enthusiasm for technology in general, is there
any value to this star gazing?
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, founded his company on a 'vision' of how
microprocessor chips would put 'a personal computer on every desk and in
every home,' and the opportunities that this would create for selling
software programs.
'Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder) and I wrote that down on day one,' Gates
recalls. Eighteen years, and several billions of revenue dollars, later
Gates still sets aside a few 'think weeks' each year to 'figure out trends
that are going to affect us and what we ought to be doing about them. It is
something you have to give a lot of thought to.'
What does Gates make of Gerstner's apparent disdain for vision? 'It depends
what you mean by vision,' he responds. 'In the broad sense, it is not
sufficient or necessary. But having a technology strategy, figuring out the
industry direction, the factors that are influencing the business and the
synergies between them is very important.'
According to Mike Maples, Microsoft executive vice-president: 'Vision is
knowing where to go'. Picking the technologies that are going to be
important and then being willing to invest in them is a key ingredient of
industry leadership, he maintains.
Vision can, however, be blinding. In the past, IBM was prone to seeing the
information industry through Big Blue-tinted glasses. Hence, the company
mapped out a grand strategy called SAA that pulled all the disparate pieces
of its technology together, but failed to recognise that the market was
taking a different path defined by industry standards.
Lew Platt, Hewlett-Packard chief executive, takes a more pragmatic approach
to 'vision'. 'While we're excited about our vision of the future and how HP
can participate in its creation, we don't intend to get blinded by 'the
vision thing',' he recently told customers. 'Computer makers must keep sight
of a 'basic truth'. We build things customers want. They are the architects
of our vision.'
However, customers with a vested interest in today's technology are not
always the best seers. Users of H-P computers no doubt foresee a great
future for Unix, but it is a fair bet that buyers of Microsoft's programs
look forward to new versions of Windows. Similarly, users of IBM mainframes
are unlikely to tell the company to get out of that business.
Too much vision can also be a dangerous thing, as Apple Computer has
discovered. While putting its energies into long-term innovative projects,
such as Newton, Apple has failed to maintain the momentum of its core
Macintosh personal computer business. Computer companies cannot afford to
become so excited about the future that they lose focus on near-term issues
and priorities.
Many high-technology visions also turn out to be pipe dreams. Steve Jobs's
Next Computer, which he had hoped to build into a computer company repeating
his success at Apple, is one of the most celebrated examples.
Indeed, there are many reasons to avoid technology vision. It can be
blinding, expensive, misleading and fleeting. Yet companies without it must
inevitably rely upon the foresight of others, becoming technology followers
rather than leaders.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Microsoft polishes its 'Windows'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of enhancements to 'Windows', Microsoft's best-selling PC operating
environment, are on the horizon.
The next technology will be Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Version 2 -
which will be shipped in the coming months as part of products such as
Microsoft Publisher.
The idea behind OLE is that all types of information can be treated as
'objects' that can be copied, moved or manipulated within any Windows
application program. Object types include text, graphics, animation
sequences, short film clips, voice messages and spreadsheet models.
OLE will provide flexibility to PC users who are familiar with the options
on all of the applications programs at their disposal. Yet it threatens to
plunge less-experienced users into unfamiliar territory without obvious
means of escape, creating potential support problems.
Merging MS-Dos and Windows as a single PC operating system will result in a
program called Chicago. It will feature 'pre-emptive multitasking' meaning
that several functions can be carried out simultaneously.
Microsoft is pinning a great deal of hope on Chicago, which is scheduled for
introduction in about 12 months. 'Chicago will be the most popular systems
update we have ever put out,' Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, said.
By the time Chicago is shipped, Microsoft expects that there will be 50m
copies of Windows sold - and Gates says that if Chicago does not generate at
least Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) in sales during its first year he will be
disappointed.
Due in about 18 months, Cairo is the ultimate version of Windows. It will
'learn' how each user works, enabling them to customise the way they
organise and find information on their computer.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Bruised but not beaten - Microsoft is giving
mixed signals about its future prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, these are trying times. His company is
under scrutiny for alleged anti-trust violations; Wall Street has soured on
the stock; and after 18 years of spectacular growth Microsoft is planning
for a 'bumpy' year ahead. Could Microsoft have lost the golden touch that
has enabled it to become the largest software company in the world, made
Gates, 37, the richest man in the US and created hundreds of millionaires
among its employees?
This is the sort of question that irritates Gates. From his perspective,
Microsoft's achievements to date have nothing to do with a Midas charm,
rather they reflect hard work and perseverance, long-term vision and
commitment.
He has no patience with 'simplistic analysis' that assumes Microsoft will
inevitably be successful in anything the company turns its hand to. Or, as
is now the case, that short-term expectations for slower growth may signal
that Microsoft's glory days are coming to a close.
Indeed, predicting the outlook for Microsoft is complicated by numerous
issues. Not the least of these is whether Microsoft will face an anti-trust
suit. The US Justice Department is currently reviewing documents from a
three-and-a-half year investigation conducted by the US Federal Trade
Commission.
Other problems for Microsoft include a downward trend in software prices and
a weak market environment in Europe, one of its largest markets. With no big
operating system software product introductions planned for the next 12
months, Microsoft also faces an unusual dry spell. Revenues from the
company's core business - software for office PCs - may grow less rapidly
than in the past.
Yet the company is driving ahead with ambitious plans to enter new markets
such as programs for hand-held 'personal digital assistants,' software for
children, multimedia products and software for the 'digital highways' of the
future.
Microsoft is also developing two new generations of personal computer
operating systems; one for desktop PCs, codenamed Chicago, and a second,
called Cairo, for computer networks (see below).
But torn between blowing Microsoft's trumpet, to impress customers and
investors, or highlighting its vulnerabilities, to appease Washington
regulators, Gates and other Microsoft executives are delivering a mixed
message about the company's future prospects.
'In looking at this industry and Microsoft's role in it, I am very
optimistic,' Gates says. 'We are investing in a very optimistic way.'
In the next breath, however, he is urging caution. 'A number of these
investments may take a long time to pay off,' he says. 'If these new things
kick in, then we will go back to higher growth. If we're wrong, then we
won't ever advance beyond the level we are at today.'
Microsoft's propensity to point out the risks associated with entering new
markets, and that even its new PC software products could 'bomb', has
contributed to Wall Street's uncertainties.
'That tone of conservatism is part of our culture. We expect good results,
but prefer them to come as surprises,' Gates says. Yet veteran Microsoft
watchers believe that the company's recent emphasis on potential problems is
at least in part aimed at the ears of anti-trust regulators in Washington
DC.
For example, Microsoft is at pains to point out that it does have
competitors. Executives even highlighted rival products in a presentation to
financial analysts less than two weeks ago. And in an attempt to win
political support, Gates reels off the benefits which the PC industry has
provided to the US economy, such as growth in exports and the creation of
jobs.
'Today's software business is thriving, and it is not just Microsoft,' says
Gates. 'There are 750 software companies in the state of Washington alone
and the majority of them write software (applications programs) for
Microsoft Windows. Net employment went up by more than the size of Microsoft
just in the last year. . .the incredible thing is how well the US has done
in this business.' The Clinton administration would be foolish to do
anything that threatened the future of Microsoft, Gates seems to be
implying.
Politics aside, the greatest challenges facing Microsoft lie in the
development of a series of ground-breaking technologies. Gates is placing a
big bet on software for 'digital highways' - which could deliver multimedia
information services to millions of businesses and homes.
His goal is to establish a software standard for the way people use
information services, whether they be entertainment services on interactive
television, public information services at a kiosk in a shopping centre or
business information services in the office.
Partnerships - with cable television companies, telephone companies and
companies in the entertainment field - will be an important aspect of
Microsoft's involvement in digital highways. While denying reports that
Microsoft has already struck a deal, Gates acknowledges that Microsoft is
talking to US West as well as other US telephone companies, and TCI and Time
Warner, the two largest US cable television companies. The gold rush
surrounding 'digital convergence' also has movie moguls, newspaper
companies, AT&amp;T and IBM knocking on his door, Gates says.
'You will see us enter into all sorts of partnerships.' Some will merely be
agreements to collaborate in trials of interactive television service.
Others may be 'hard-core joint ventures'. Microsoft also plans to make
minority equity investments in companies involved in digital highways.
'I am not aware of any other company that is making the kind of bet that we
are on digital information highways,' Gates says. The company will spend
'many tens of millions of dollars' developing the technology, and 'won't get
any revenue for at least three years. And it could all be wasted, but that
is the name of the game'.
The 'game' of spotting new technology directions and turning them into
business opportunities is one at which Gates is a master and with Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in cash resources, Microsoft can even afford to lose a
few rounds.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Euro-constituency plans announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced the procedures it will use to redraw the
electoral boundaries of England and Wales for next year's elections to the
European parliament.
The addition of an extra five constituencies in England, and one for Wales,
which followed a deal at last year's Edinburgh summit to compensate for the
addition of 18 new seats in eastern Germany, required extensive alterations
to the electoral map. Public consultation will now be carried out very
quickly.
The Committee for England, appointed by Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, proposes to publish its provisional recommendations for European
constituencies on September 22. Representations for or against these
recommendations and counter-proposals will need to be submitted to the
committee by October 22.
These will then be deposited in each district council area by November 8,
and any responses will have to be submitted by November 24.
The government said: 'The timetable in the bill does not permit the
committee to hold local inquiries. The timetable is tight because of the
requirement in the bill to report 'as soon as practicable' and also because
the next European parliamentary elections are to be held in June 1994.'
However, the committee is confident that it can make final recommendations
to the home secretary by Christmas. It added that it was 'aware that the
tightness of the intended timetable outlined may cause problems for local
authorities and other organisations. The timetable is unavoidable'.
Some Conservatives have complained about the timetable and Labour has
criticised the plans for not involving the independent Boundary Commission,
which is responsible for setting constituencies for the UK parliament.
Commission members will advise the committee.
Under the rules, each European constituency must include two or more
parliamentary constituencies, and no parliamentary constituency will be
split between two European constituencies. The total electorate in each case
will be as close as possible to an average figure of 512,851.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Suburbs of Roman settlement unearthed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIAL suburbs of a small Roman town, possibly Villa Faustini, have
been found by archaeologists.
The town, straddling the River Waveney at Scole on the Norfolk-Suffolk
border, is believed to have thrived for four centuries until the Romans
abandoned Britain in the early fifth century and may have had a population
of 2,000.
Mr Myk Flitcroft, the project leader who yesterday escorted Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, around the dig, said it offered a rare
chance to examine a large area of a Roman town and could yield important
information.
He added that most research had focused on the big cities of Roman Britain,
whereas the new find would throw light on the planning and development of a
small town.
The centre of the town lies beneath Scole, and the dig, on the site of the
planned A140 Scole bypass, has found much of its industrial outskirts.
Archaeologists have found evidence of tanning, shoe making, iron smelting, a
smithy, lead moulding and what they believe was a watermill.
They have found two clay-lined water tanks beside a Roman canal, with its
shoring timbers intact, cut alongside the Waveney, possibly to supply the
town's water.
The remains include part of a metalled Roman road and some building
foundations, together with metal artefacts including high-quality jewellery
and coins dating from 50BC until the end of the Roman period.
Two half-finished wooden bowls, preserved in waterlogged peat, are thought
to be unique in Britain. They reveal that the maker chiselled out the
outside but stored the blocks until he was ready to carve out the inside.
The town developed from a staging post on the road between Colchester, the
largest civilian city in Roman Britain, to Caistor-by-Norwich, the 'capital'
of East Anglia.
The 26-week dig began in June and will cover more than 30,000 square metres,
about a fifth of the town.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Harrods rebuffs prison's cheese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS THE government's programme to involve the private sector in
Britain's prisons had recovered from jokes about prisoners escaping when
transported by security companies, it yesterday ran into another potential
embarrassment. About cheese.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, last week launched
an innovative scheme at East Sutton Park prison, Kent, where women inmates
have been trained in cheesemaking.
They are producing mozzarella and ricotta which will be marketed by Mr
Edgardo Pasquali, a private-sector partner of the Prison Service, through
his company Mama Mia.
At the inauguration of the scheme Mr Pasquali said products would go to
'only the best' outlets, including many leading London stores, hotels and
restaurants.
But Harrods, one of the up-market outlets named by Mr Pasquali, asserted
yesterday: 'We do not stock this cheese and it is unlikely that we will do
so.'
Mr Pasquali, whose enthusiasm for the quality of the cheese being produced
by the prisoners is evident, remained convinced yesterday that few suppliers
will be able to resist stocking it. But he admitted that it remained a
matter for negotiation.
Mr Pietro Pesce, whose company Danmar has been asked to handle the
distribution of the cheeses in central London, said yesterday that he had
just returned from holiday and had not yet discussed final arrangements with
Mr Pasquali.
Mr Pesce said: 'Harrods and many other leading London outlets are customers
of ours, and are the sort of suppliers we would offer the cheese to. It is a
good, locally produced product and I am sure they would wish to consider it.
But obviously we cannot force any customer to take a particular product.'
The Prison Service says many checks were made before it entered into the
partnership. 'We are satisfied that the product is good and the venture is a
sound one,' it said.
One of the intentions of the project is to help prepare prisoners for future
employment. Yesterday's developments suggest that skills learned on the
scheme might extend far beyond cheesemaking into the complex world of
negotiations between producers, distributors, retailers and public and
private-sector partners.

FT  10 AUG 93 / English cricket fails its test in management: Lucy Kellaway
seeks advice from business experts on the non-sporting qualities Ted
Dexter's successor will need
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a once-great company makes losses in all its main markets and its
chairman resigns in disgrace, it is time for a complete rethink.
Likewise with the England cricket team. Yesterday Mr Ted Dexter, chairman of
the England selectors since 1989, announced that he would resign at the end
of the present series against Australia.
England's defeat yesterday means it is losing 4-0 in the six-match series
and has lost nine of its last 10 Tests.
Under Mr Dexter, England has played 44 Tests, won nine, lost 21 and drawn
14.
As the team struggles to repair the damage, management experts are queueing
up to offer advice.
Mr Paul Buchanan-Barrow of headhunters Korn/Ferry says: 'If the English
cricket team was a business it would have a three- to five-year corporate
plan. It would mean short-term pain - but that could not be more painful
than being 4-0 down against Australia.'
The first step, they all agree, is to get the right person at the top.
According to Mr Edgar Wille of Ashridge Management College the chairman of
the cricket selectors needs to have at least 10 management 'competencies'.
He needs the social skills of team-building, networking, listening and
empathy. He needs the ability to take risks and to view the world from new
perspectives. He must be perceptive, curious, have a good knowledge of his
competitors, and be able to gather and use information.
These management skills are not necessarily those that great cricketers
specialise in; indeed, Mr Buchanan-Barrow questions whether the England team
really needs to have a cricketer at the top at all.
'You need someone capable of selecting technicians who can bat or bowl,' he
says. 'You might find someone suitable in a successful organisation like
SmithKline Beecham or Mars. They must have judgment and vision.'
Mr Andrew Campbell, a director of Ashridge Strategic Management Centre,
says: 'There is a difficulty in creating a shared sense of mission in these
national teams when they only play together occasionally.
'The individuals are under so much pressure they lose sight of team
responsibilities. They see themselves not as cricketers but as managers of
the brand name.'
Mr Campbell questions whether the mechanism of selecting the players is the
best one.
Most companies would be embarrassed to admit that they promoted staff in the
haphazard way of the England cricket team - by part-timers basing judgments
on a series of impressions.
Most large companies have a formal assessment procedure in which staff
members are appraised every year and their record kept on file. County teams
could do the same.
However, as many companies have found, this assessment procedure can be only
as effective as the people who undertake it.
A formal system can promise no solution if, like Mr Dexter, the assessors
make the wrong choices.

FT  10 AUG 93 / GKN defence contract will secure 500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the UK engineering group, has been awarded one of its biggest export
contracts in a deal to supply more than 200 Warrior armoured fighting
vehicles to Kuwait.
Negotiations are continuing between the UK and Kuwaiti governments for GKN
to supply more than 100 Piranha light armoured vehicles. The final combined
value of the two contracts would be more than Pounds 500m.
The Warrior tracked combat vehicles were battle-tested during the Gulf war
and are now deployed by British Army units serving with United Nations
forces in Bosnia.
The vehicles will be assembled by GKN Defence at its plant at Telford,
Shropshire,and are expected to begin production late next year. GKN shares
rose yesterday by 4p to 502 1/2 p.
The company said the Kuwaiti contract would secure about 500 jobs at Telford
for the next four to five years. It will follow completion of the present
Ministry of Defence contract for 789 Warrior vehicles. Deliveries of those
began in late 1987 and are due to be completed towards the end of next year.
For the Kuwaiti contract, GKN has developed the Desert Warrior as a variant
of the British Army Warrior used in the Gulf War.
The Desert Warrior, demonstrated in trials in Kuwait last year, has a US
Delco turret in preference to the gun provided by Royal Ordnance, the
subsidiary of British Aerospace, for the British Army vehicle, along with a
25mm Bushmaster cannon and optional Hughes Aircraft TOW anti-tank missile
launchers.
GKN said yesterday the 'great majority' of components for the Kuwaiti
contract would be sourced in the UK.
The Warrior vehicle is designed to allow the infantry to keep pace with the
main battle tanks and can carry supplies and weapons for a 48-hour battle in
nuclear, biological and chemical warfare conditions.
GKN said its contract with the UK Ministry of Defence would be signed 'in
the very near future'.
The deal follows the signing of an initial memorandum of understanding
between London and Kuwait on the provision of defence equipment and related
services as part of Kuwait's plans to rebuild its armed forces following the
Gulf war.
The Ministry of Defence said that it hoped the Warrior contract would be
'the first of a number of significant' arms purchases' by Kuwait from the
UK.
The Piranha wheeled armoured vehicle, the purchase of which is still under
negotiation, is assembled by GKN under licence from MOWAG of Switzerland,
for which GKN Defence act as system prime contractor for variant design,
production and marketing.
Kuwait is proposing to spend more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) on arms
procurement by the end of the decade. But faced with other spending needs,
it wants 30 per cent of the value of any defence contract to be reinvested
in the country.
The MoD said yesterday that 'any such offset deals are a matter for GKN'.
The announcement of the contract was a boost for the UK defence industry
after a series of disappointments.
In February, France beat the US and Britain to supply almost 400 battle
tanks to the United Arab Emirates in a deal worth about Dollars 3.5bn.
Although it has won an order for about 40 tanks from Oman, Vickers is still
fighting to secure a much larger order from Saudi Arabia, which is
considering a further purchase of 235 tanks in addition to the 465 M1A2s it
is due to receive from General Dynamics.
VSEL, which is trying to follow GKN into the Kuwaiti market with its AS90
howitzer, said yesterday that progress towards an order was 'slow'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEWHAM Borough Council yesterday launched a campaign to attract an
international passenger station for the Channel tunnel rail link to
Stratford in east London, Vanessa Houlder writes.
Its proposal is supported by a group of public-sector and private-sector
bodies including Land Securities, the University of East London and the
London Docklands Development Corporation.
Purfleet, Rainham and Dartford are also possible sites for the international
passenger station between Ashford, Kent, and St Pancras in London which is
intended to ease congestion in central London. The government is expected to
make a decision on the site by the end of the year.
Stratford has based its case on recent improvements to its transport links,
and the role the station would play in the regeneration of east London
including the likely boost to 100 hectares of surrounding land which is
vacant and ready for development.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Lib Dem victor warns on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrat victor in last month's Christchurch by-election claimed
yesterday that the government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic
fuel bills could threaten Mr John Major's hold on Downing Street.
In a letter to the prime minister Mrs Diana Maddock - who overturned a
Conservative majority of 23,000 - said the by-election result showed that
the imposition of VAT would be as damaging to the government as the move by
former prime minister Baroness Thatcher to replace rates with a poll tax.

FT  10 AUG 93 / VSEL in limited offer to Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL, the Barrow-in-Furness naval shipbuilder, has offered to take over the
management of shipbuilding at its troubled Tyneside rival Swan Hunter,
Daniel Green writes.
VSEL, which in May won a competition against Swans to build a helicopter
carrier for the Ministry of Defence, wants to manage Swans' work on three
Type 23 Navy frigates.
Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, said: 'Under no circumstances are
we interested in all of Swan Hunter. We are interested in certain assets and
in the possibility of managing the completion of the three frigates.'
Swans went into receivership in May after it lost the helicopter carrier
contract. Price Waterhouse, the receiver, said yesterday that it would not
yet accept an offer that did not mean the sale of all or 'a substantial
part' of the yard.
VSEL approached Price Waterhouse shortly after its appointment as receiver
and had been hoping for a clear response by now. Details of other offers for
all or part of Swans may be announced this morning at a creditors' meeting.
Swans won the frigate contract in 1989 against bids from other naval
shipyards including Cammell Laird, owned by VSEL. The contract should
provide work until November next year and improves the prospects of the yard
being sold as a going concern.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Hill Samuel to advise DoT on Channel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Transport has appointed Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, as
its adviser on the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link in succession to
Samuel Montagu.
The move, the result of a re-tendering process which lasted several weeks,
follows consultations by the department with private-sector companies on how
the rail link could proceed as a joint project. This led to a change in the
department's remit requiring more active work with the private sector. A
large part of Hill Samuel's brief will be 'to generate interest in the
private sector and go out more proactively'.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said: 'The rail link is now
moving into a new phase. Public consultations on the route will have
finished and it will have been safeguarded for planning purposes by the end
of this year.'
He added: 'The government has committed itself to making a substantial
contribution towards the cost of the rail link, and we want to transfer the
project to the private sector as soon as possible so that it can go forward
as a joint venture between the public and private sectors.'
The department said it was happy with the work completed by Samuel Montagu.
It added: 'Because our concept of the brief had changed we thought it was
only fair to start another tendering process. There is no implied criticism
of Samuel Montagu, and the work they have already completed is very much the
basis of how we go forward from here.'
Hill Samuel said the project would involve mainly its corporate finance and
project work arms.
The rail link was the biggest public-sector project it had accepted,
although it had previously taken on infrastructure financing overseas.
Consultation with the private sector began on May 25. The department had
originally hoped that conclusions on private-sector involvement would be
reached by the beginning of July.
Private-sector interest in the project has come from several companies,
including Eurorail, a grouping which includes General Electric Company;
Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotel group; and
BICC, the engineering and construction company.
Eurorail is chaired by Lord Parkinson, a former transport secretary, and its
emergence was regarded as a strong indicator of enthusiasm for the
government's attempts to attract private funding into public infrastructure.
Arthur D. Little, the international firm of management and technology
consultants, has been appointed an external professional adviser to the
Department of Transport and the British Railways Board.
It is to examine the structure of BR's engineering research and development
division at Derby and arrangements for railway research and development in
advance of the industry's privatisation.
The consultancy will report on the best options to achieve a 'viable and
competitive R&amp;D structure' within the industry and on funding arrangements.
It has been asked to report by mid-December.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Hard Ecu plan deepens Tory rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESURRECTION of prime minister John Major's proposal for a common
European currency appeared yesterday to have aggravated Tory tensions over
Europe less than a week after Foreign Office ministers had launched a
concerted attempt to damp them down.
The plan to create a 'hard Ecu' - a 'common' currency to trade alongside
Europe's national currencies - was dismissed as 'pie in the sky' by Mr
Michael Spicer, the hardline Tory Euro-sceptic.
Mr Spicer, MP for Worcestershire South, said the objective of a single
European currency would become the law of Europe, to be implemented by
January 1 1999, if the Maastricht treaty was ratified.
Pro-European Tories were more positive about the revival of Mr Major's plan.
Mr Ray Whitney, the MP for Wycombe, said it was worth 'taking down the file
marked hard Ecu and looking at it again'. The plan represented a 'pragmatic
and realistic' approach, he added.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC vice-president who warned at the weekend that some
of Britain's EC partners might try to accelerate progress towards full
monetary union, said the hard Ecu was 'worth thinking about' among other
options.
The Institute of Directors - which last week set the ball rolling by
claiming that the hard Ecu was the only option left for business to gain
full advantage from the single European market - launched an attack on Sir
Edward Heath. It criticised the former prime minister for 'suggesting that
business wants a European single currency rather than a common currency'.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said Mr Major was 'listening to
business' in reopening the hard Ecu issue. Sir Edward's 'dream' of a single
currency and full monetary union was not 'within the realm of practical
economics this century'.
Mr Nick Brown, a Labour frontbench Treasury spokesman, said the hard Ecu was
'a non-starter'. The proposition would be 'laughed at by those with a
serious knowledge of the topic and not understood by anyone else'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last week began the task of trying
to heal Tory wounds over Europe by holding private meetings with
backbenchers in an effort to highlight common ground.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Companies look to their futures: Forex hedging has a new
urgency after the ERM tremors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGING foreign-exchange risk 'has become more complicated, more
time-consuming and the costs have gone up. We have to fiddle round with bits
of minor currencies. It diverts valuable time from doing deals.'
This litany of complaints about the effective collapse of the European
exchange rate mechanism comes from Mr Rusi Kathoke, finance director of
British Technology Group, which licenses technology around the world.
But it could have come from any small or medium-sized British company coping
with the new currency regime.
Smaller companies are not alone in suffering from currency uncertainty, but
they are less likely than large ones to have the staff and the expertise to
deal with it. They are also more likely to trade only within Europe, and
therefore to have relied on the ERM to protect them from volatility in
currencies.
'Larger companies have been hedging currencies for some while,' said Mr
Robert Mapstone, a derivatives specialist at NatWest Capital Markets.
However, the surge of volatility in the currency markets last summer,
culminating in sterling's departure from the ERM in September, sparked a
fresh wave of interest in hedging foreign-exchange risk.
'There has been a trend towards increased use of derivative instruments
(futures and options contracts),' said Mr Geoffrey Isaac, chairman of MTM
Partnership, a financial strategy consultancy.
However, some companies only use forward foreign-exchange contracts, which
involve buying a currency at a set rate in advance, rather than options,
which give the holder an option to buy a currency at a set rate at a set
time. This is because some companies consider forward contracts a cheaper
and sometimes less risky form of hedging. But unlike forward contracts,
buying an option does not lock a company into a potentially unfavourable
exchange rate.
Most large companies said there had been no change of policy following the
ERM shake-up just over a week ago.
'We haven't seen the risks we run as being changed, but the adoption of
wider bands may focus the attention of some companies (on foreign-exchange
risk),' said Mr John Grout, director of treasury at Cadbury Schweppes, the
food and drinks group. Cadbury already makes extensive use of options to
hedge its exposure to foreign-exchange risk, mainly dollars and D-Marks.
Guinness, the drinks group, is also active in hedging its currency exposure.
It said there had been no action because the company's exposure is already
hedged well into next year.
Hedging has become a necessity rather than a choice even for companies which
in the past have steered clear of the derivatives market. They feared
repeating the experience of Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks group, which
two years ago lost Pounds 150m from writing currency options.
Companies are taking what Mr Christopher Taylor, head of foreign exchange
and money markets at Barclays, sees as 'a more enlightened approach' to
derivative instruments.
But he says it is not only large companies which are active in hedging
exposure: 'In many cases it's the small-to-medium-sized companies which have
been more active because they have shorter management chains: one of the
barriers in larger companies is the need for senior management approval.'
Designers Guild, a designer and manufacturer of fabrics and wallpapers based
in west London, recently decided to take out forward contracts to cover 60
per cent of its foreign currency exposure. 'I wish now I had taken out 100
per cent cover,' said Mr Mark Naughton-Rumbo, financial controller. The
company exports more than 60 per cent of its annual turnover of Pounds 18m.
It has also had to allocate one staff member to compile a report each
morning on the company's foreign-exchange exposure. 'The foreign-exchange
position can change overnight,' said Mr Naughton-Rumbo. 'We could not afford
to take a Pounds 50,000 foreign currency loss.'
But for some, the worst impact of the volatility in currencies has been the
damage it had done to business confidence throughout Europe. 'The level of
uncertainty won't help us out of the recession,' remarked Mr Naughton-Rumbo.
Suppliers of machinery and other capital equipment, with long lead times
between the order and delivery, face particular difficulties. 'How can I
quote a price to a customer in France when it takes two to three months
until delivery?' said Mr Fred Marshall, managing director of Speedex
(Engineering), a Bradford-based manufacturer of plastics extrusion machinery
with annual sales of nearly Pounds 3m.
He added: 'When I talk to my customers it is not about the technicalities of
our machines but about currencies. I can't understand the sense of allowing
gamblers, people who don't manufacture, to dictate what a currency is worth.
The ideal would be for one currency.'

FT  10 AUG 93 / Industry keeps down price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICES of goods leaving factories barely changed last month, reflecting
the continued weakness of inflationary pressures in the economy.
The producer prices index rose by a non-seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in
July compared with June. The movement suggests that, in spite of signs of
economic recovery, manufacturers remain reluctant to raise prices for fear
of damaging demand. Prices last month were 4.1 per cent higher than a year
before.
Excluding food, drink and tobacco, for which price changes are more
volatile, the index rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent on the
previous month to stand 2.5 per cent higher than a year before.
Prices of raw materials and fuels used by manufacturing industry were
unchanged in July against a revised 0.5 per cent increase in June.
Although imported input prices have risen sharply since sterling left the
European exchange rate mechanism last September, there has not been a
corresponding increase in output prices. This indicates that producers have
so far absorbed most of the the higher cost of raw materials.
Falling labour costs - which account for about two thirds of total producer
costs - have made it easier for manufacturers to cope with the higher costs
of imports.
Input prices were falling by 0.8 per cent year-on-year in September last
year. They are now rising at a rate of 6.6 per cent, slightly lower than in
March when the rate of increase was almost 8 per cent. The slowdown of input
price inflation since March reflects the gradual strengthening of the pound
on the foreign exchanges.
Unadjusted, the input prices index fell 0.9 per cent month-on-month,
reflecting seasonal falls in the prices of home-produced inputs for food
manufacturers.
The seasonally adjusted index was unchanged last month on the figure for
June.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office show that any upward
pressure on producer prices is coming from imported food manufacturing
materials, metals and other imported materials.
Prices of imported food products used by manufacturers were 17 per cent
dearer last month than in July last year while metals prices were up 16.2
per cent year-on-year. Chemicals prices fell 1.4 per cent month-on-month but
were up 7.2 per cent compared with a year before. Home-produced food
manufacturing materials were 4.3 per cent cheaper in July than in June.
The sluggishness of producer price inflation suggests that the outlook for
retail price inflation remains good.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Qatar to contest tribunal's Pounds 385m award to Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
QATAR is to contest the ruling last month by a Geneva-based arbitration
tribunal that it, along with two other Arab governments, owes the British
helicopter company Westland Pounds 385m in an action for breach of contract.
Last month the tribunal awarded Westland the money in damages in the
company's action against the governments of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, as well as the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation
and the Arab British Helicopter Company.
A statement carried by the Qatari News Agency yesterday said the tribunal
'has no jurisdiction over any of the three countries, and any ruling by it
does not bind any of these countries to pay any amount of money to
Westland'.
The dispute, which has been continuing since 1980 in the International
Chamber of Commerce, concerns the collapse of an Egyptian-based helicopter
manufacturing project.
The tribunal decided in Westland's favour two years ago, ruling that the
industrialisation body and the three states were liable for damages for
breach of contract. The sum owed was set last month.
The project, launched in 1978, involved setting up manufacturing facilities
in Egypt for Westland Lynx military helicopters. It was to be done through
Arab British Helicopter, a joint venture with the industrialisation body,
Egypt and the three Gulf states.
The partnership broke up after the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty and the
subsequent ostracism of Egypt by other Arab governments, leaving Westland
stranded after investing in the new facility.
The four partner countries were to have bought the first 250 helicopters
produced at the plant, with further production intended for export.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Stamp fraud 'costs millions'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STAMP fraudsters are costing the Post Office millions of pounds a year by
selling fake stamps and 'washed' stamps - used stamps with the postmark
removed - the government said yesterday.
In a letter to Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for Linlithgow, Mr Patrick
McLoughlin, the junior trade and industry minister, said: 'It is difficult
to judge the scale . . . but I'm told it could well run into millions of
pounds a year.'
The biggest single recent case was in 1989, when Post Office investigators
found sacks containing Pounds 10m of used stamps. The fraud involved dealers
buying used stamps from charities, chemically 'washing' them and selling
them - mainly as mint unfranked examples to collectors, although some were
believed to have been resold for general use. About 60 people have been
arrested since April 1991 for stamp offences.
Mr McLoughlin said: 'There is little hope of eradicating this problem
entirely,' and the Post Office said there had never been a precise estimate
of the level of potential fraud.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Slaughters tops takeover league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLAUGHTER AND MAY has emerged as the leading legal adviser to those involved
in public takeovers in the first six months of 1993.
The City firm of solicitors advised companies or financial advisers in seven
deals worth Pounds 654m, says Acquisitions Monthly magazine, which has
ranked firms of lawyers by the value of the takeovers in which they acted as
advisers.
The biggest contribution to Slaughter and May's total came from Airtours'
failed Pounds 283m bid for Owners Abroad. The firm acted for Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, financial advisers to the bidders.
The bid dominated the first half of 1993 and had a disproportionate effect
on rankings, the magazine says.
Herbert Smith, which acted for Owners Abroad, rose from sixth overall in
1992 to second on the strength of its involvement. Linklaters &amp; Paines,
which ranked fourth, acted for Airtours.
The magazine has also produced a league table of legal advisers involved in
private takeovers. Slaughter and May emerged as the leading legal adviser in
private deals, ranked first for its involvement in 20 deals worth a total of
Pounds 1.7bn. The biggest contribution to its total came from its role as
adviser to Mercury Communications in the sale of 20 per cent of its shares
to BCE of Canada for Pounds 480m.
Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law firm, which finished 11th in the
public deals table, was placed second for its involvement in 20 private
deals worth Pounds 1.27bn. As well as acting for NewCo on the Pounds 402m
buy-out of Gardner Merchant, Clifford Chance was involved in the Pounds 345m
sale of Del Monte Foods International to Royal Foods of the UK and South
Africa's Anglo American Corporation.
One of the noticeable features of the private deals table is the presence in
the top 15 of two large regional law firms.
The magazine says that the presence of Leeds-based Dibb Lupton Broomhead in
sixth place and Manchester's Addleshaw Sons &amp; Latham in 13th shows that
regional firms are posing a threat to the traditional dominance of mergers
and acquisitions work by the large City law firms.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Tesco halts imports of 25% cheaper Stella beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO, the supermarket group, has stopped selling cut-price Stella Artois
lager imported through its French subsidiary.
The sales, though welcomed by consumers, had been seen as a threat to the
profits of Whitbread, which brews the Belgian beer under licence in the UK,
and to other brewers and importers of premium lagers.
Whitbread has successfully promoted Stella Artois as 'reassuringly
expensive', placing it in the premium price bracket.
By obtaining supplies from France, where the beer is sold as a much cheaper
standard brand, Tesco for the past four weeks has been offering a 24-pack of
25cl bottles for Pounds 9.99 - a discount of about 25 per cent.
Though it seemed unlikely that Tesco could maintain the price for long
without sacrificing profit margins, the move roused concern in the industry.
British brewers and distributors saw it as a potential threat to their
positions in the fast-growing premium lager market which they have created
by spending heavily on marketing brands such as Stella Artois, Beck's and
Holsten.
Tesco's promotion was prompted in part by its concerns about the potential
damage to its business of increased personal imports of beer by
cross-Channel shoppers.
Now that the promotion has ended, Whitbread, which also supplies Tesco with
brands such as Heineken lager, Boddington ale, and Murphy's stout, will
begin supplying the group with Stella Artois in continental-style packaging
as well as cans, next month.
'It will be supplied at our usual prices,' the brewer said; and the
'reassuringly expensive' advertising will resume in October.

FT  10 AUG 93 / North-south divide persists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG north-south divide persists in England, says an analysis of data
from all 366 English local authorities after the official census of 1991.
The analysis by the Bristol-based School for Advanced Urban Studies and the
city's Statistical Monitoring Group highlights changes in housing and
population patterns in terms of age, family structure, employment and
health.
Every district experienced growth in home ownership and a decline in council
housing, it says. Home ownership varied from almost 90 per cent in Castle
Point near Basildon, Essex, to less than 25 per cent in Tower Hamlets,
London.
More than half the households in Surrey Heath had access to two or more
cars, compared with fewer than one in 10 households in most inner-London
districts and areas such as Liverpool, Manchester and Hull. In more than 100
districts, one in four households had at least one person suffering from a
long-term illness, health problem or handicap which limited daily activity.
There was a concentration of such illness in the north, in inner cities and
in Cornwall.
The highest proportions of lone parents were in inner London, northern
cities such as Manchester and Liverpool and depressed industrial areas.

FT  10 AUG 93 / 'Archaic' licensing rules attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Consumers' Association has urged the government to abolish the
'unnecessarily archaic and complicated' liquor licensing system.
'The present system is woefully out of date in meeting customer needs,' the
association says in response to a Home Office consultation paper on possible
reforms of the law in England and Wales.
The association adds: 'It represents the single most effective barrier to
potential new entrants into the retail beer market. Liberalisation of the
laws would make the market more accessible . . . and go some way towards
challenging the market power maintained by the established brewers through
their tied estates.'
Other methods of regulation could ensure that the public interest was
protected, the association says. Unscrupulous operators who serve alcohol to
children, for example, could be banned from the trade.
Issues affecting the suitability of premises, or questions of noise and
nuisance, could be dealt with by enforcement of planning laws.
If the government persists with the present system, administered by
licensing justices, then 'any degree of liberalisation would be a step in
the right direction', the association says.
Statutory grounds for refusing licences should be instituted, it says. 'We
are concerned that the current system, which allows the justices such wide
discretionary powers, is neither transparent nor fair.'
Refusal of a pub licence on grounds of lack of need or demand in a locality
should be abolished, the association adds. 'Need should be decided in the
marketplace itself.'
The association also supports greater relaxation of opening hours. It is
particularly critical of restrictions on Sunday afternoons and their effect
on the tourist trade.

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Ministers break off talks on Nafta's
supplementary pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS from the US, Canada and Mexico yesterday suddenly broke off 10
days of talks on side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement
in Washington.
They left strong doubts that they can complete a deal in time to implement
the pact on schedule next January.
The ministers stated there was 'a handful of remaining issues. Officials
will continue to work this week in order to address these issues.'
Who those officials are remained a mystery. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US deputy trade
representative, was seen leaving for vacation in a van with his family. Mr
Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, let it be known that he plans to
leave for his vacation on Friday.
Mr Thomas Hockin, Canada's trade minister, was to leave yesterday for a
cabinet meeting in Ottawa. Officials of Canada, the US and Mexico denied
that the latter two countries were negotiating separate deals in the talks
over environment, labour, import surges and financing of a US-Mexico border
clean-up.
Canada has been a firm opponent of a US proposal to create a strong
enforcement mechanism if any of the three governments were to fail to
enforce its labour or environmental laws. Mexico has backed a proposal to
use the levying of fines for enforcement, but this has been blocked by
Democrats in the US Congress.
At the very least, the US and Mexico are expected to agree to some
combination of fines and tariff 'snapbacks' in the event of 'persistent,
systematic and unjustifiable' non-enforcement of environmental laws.
In Congress, there is much concern that fighting over Nafta has 'turned
intensely ugly.' US corporations, hostile to labour and environmental
enforcement, are believed to be supplying Mexico with proposals to bring to
the bargaining.
Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer of Public Citizen, a citizens' group opposed to
Nafta, predicted there would be 'teeth' in the final agreement over
sanctions to enforce labour and environment agreements, as the Clinton
administration has often promised, but teeth at the end of 'a long, twisted,
tortuous' process of dispute settlement.
Mr Kantor has made little progress in satisfying Ms Wallach and other
opponents of the pact. Disputes between the US and Mexico over the
environment can drag on for years, critics say, because there are no precise
deadlines for investigations and settlement, unlike commercial disputes.

THE Alexander Group, a Belfast-based industrial manufacturing and supply
company, has announced details of three contracts with the Chinese coal
industry, worth about ADollars 3.5m (Pounds 1.6m), Our World Trade Staff
writes.
The company, which has established trading divisions in China, Australia and
Indonesia, negotiated the deals with the Chinese government. It will provide
equipment for coal mines in Inner Mongolia as well as Shanxi and Guangdong
provinces.
Most of the work will involve supplying a high-output mobile coal screener
in Guangdong province.
The group has also been contracted to supply and install a large coal sizer
in Inner Mongolia. The machinery is designed to reduce the size of coal for
power station fuel.
Mr Robin Alexander, chairman, said the company had been 'working hard to
achieve such contracts with the Chinese government'.

VENEZUELAN firemen and civil defence crews were yesterday pulling bodies out
of the wreckage of shanty towns ringing Caracas, after tropical storm Bret
hit at the weekend.
The storm killed about 150 people in the capital, according to reports.
Hundreds have been injured and thousands left homeless. Yesterday, residents
were clearing up after the rains (picture left).
Most of the damage occurred in the Caracas metropolitan area, where heavy
rains on Sunday morning battered slum dwellings perched on the city's many
hills, causing mudslides and burying people alive.
The total number of victims was still in doubt yesterday and the government
had not issued official figures.
Caracas newspapers estimated fatalities nationwide could exceed 300.
The US National Weather Service said yesterday that Bret, which was breaking
up as it moved off the Colombian coast, could gain strength before passing
over Central America.
The government of Venezuelan President Ramon Jose Velasquez of has declared
a state of national mourning.
Despite a big fiscal deficit, officials are looking for ways to release
funds for emergency relief.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Clinton risks westerners' ire over grazing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is again risking the ire of senators from the
west of the US with the release of fresh proposals for improving the
management of federal range land in the west. The package includes a sharp
increase in the fees charged to ranchers for grazing their livestock on
government lands.
Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said the proposed new rules, expected
to take effect next year, were aimed to improve the condition of the
landscape in 260m federally owned acres in the west, particularly on fragile
river and lake banks.
President Bill Clinton originally planned to increase grazing fees and
mining royalties on federal lands as part of his budget package, but agreed
to remove the measures from it under pressure from western senators, who
fight hard on behalf of ranchers.
The grazing fee increase will now come about through an administrative rule,
rather than through legislation. Mr Babbitt promised to tackle the mining
issue in September.
The ranchers' victory has proved short-lived but the damage it did to Mr
Clinton's presidency persists. The concession signalled to other members of
Congress that Mr Clinton could be pressed, and led to the dismemberment of
his budget package, which passed Congress last week in a much altered form.
Mr Babbitt has proposed a phased increase in grazing fees, over the next
three years, to Dollars 4.28 per animal unit month (based on the acreage
needed to feed a cow and her calf or five sheep for a month).
This would bring in some Dollars 80m from the 170m acres run by the Bureau
of Land Management, and Dollars 40m from the 94m acres of grazing allotments
run by the Forest Service.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund has resigned in the face
of severe criticism from the US Congress of the way it invested US
government money, reports George Graham in Washington.
Mr Alexander Tomlinson, the fund's president and chief executive officer,
said its operations had been paralysed by the controversy. He complained of
political interference from Congress.
In Washington, government officials said they were pleased that Mr Tomlinson
had decided to resign before he was fired.
The enterprise fund, like similar institutions operating in other eastern
European countries, was set up as a private, non-profit organisation with
Dollars 60m of US government money so as to foster private sector investment
in Hungary.
The fund, however, has repeatedly stumbled. It was criticised for backing
businesses run by former communists and, this year, came under attack for
paying a large part of the salary of Mr Pal Teleki, chairman of Hungary's
state holding company AV RT.
Its most contested decision, however, was a Dollars 4m investment in
EurAmerica Capital, a merchant bank started 14 months ago in Budapest.
Eur-America paid salaries of up to Dollars 400,000 a year to its founders,
incurring the wrath of Mr David Obey, who chairs the House of
Representatives sub-committee which controls foreign aid spending.
Mr Tomlinson, in his letter of resignation, said that Eur-America was now
operating at a profit.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Chilean right picks candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVIDED right-wing opposition in Chile has nominated Mr Arturo
Alessandri as its candidate for the presidential elections in December, in a
desperate attempt to present a united front to the electorate.
Mr Alessandri, nephew of one president and grandson of another, emerged as a
compromise candidate during the convention on Sunday of the Union for
Chilean Progress, an electoral pact of five centre-right parties.
There were scuffles at the convention when it became clear that Mr Manuel
Feliu, leader of the main opposition party, National Renewal, was not going
to win.
Mr Alessandri, an independent, faces what he acknowledged was an 'uphill
battle' in trying to defeat the current presidential front-runner, Mr
Eduardo Frei, candidate of the governing centre-left coalition.
Mr Frei, himself the son of a former president of Chile, holds what seems to
be an unassailable lead in opinion polls.
Promising to fight the campaign on the issue of law and order, Mr Alessandri
said: 'If the election were held tomorrow, I have no doubt that Frei would
win. But be careful - the election is not until next December 11.'
Others in the right-wing camp set more modest goals. 'The right cannot win
the presidential election,' said Mr Francisco Javier Cuadra, a minister
during the military regime which steppped down in 1990. 'The role of the
presidential candidate is to permit the right-wing parties to gain a strong
Congressional vote.'
The country will also hold Congressional elections on December 11.
Chile's opposition holds more than a third of the seats in Congress, enough
to block important constitutional amendments. Its semblance of unity should
enable it to retain that Congressional influence, effectively limiting the
next president's authority.

ASIA-PACIFIC trade issues will be dominated by the US and Japan, with other
countries likely to be pawns in the struggle between the region's two
economic superpowers, delegates said yesterday at the Indonesia,
Asia-Pacific and the New World Order conference on the Indonesian island of
Bali, reports William Keeling at Nusa Dua, Bali.
Dr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in
the US, said Washington showed 'strong support' for the Asian Pacific
Economic Community (Apec), which groups the US, Japan and most east Asian
nations.
But he backed the US government in accusing Japan of establishing 'very
pervasive impediments to a lot of its markets. The global affect of Japan's
market access problems. . . undercuts the prospects of maintaining an open
trading system,' Dr Bergsten warned.
In response, Japanese delegates criticised US insistence that Tokyo provide
foreign companies a minimum market share in sectors such as that of
semiconductors. 'It's a very dangerous situation where American regulators
judge products to be competitive,' noted Mr Kazuo Nukazawa, managing
director of the Japan Federation of Economic Organisations.
Other Asian delegates viewed US support of Apec as an attempt to enlist
Asian support in Washington's trade campaign against Tokyo. While remaining
sceptical of US intentions, however, they noted any improvement in market
access to Japan would benefit other east Asian countries.
Most delegates backed the informal meeting of Apec heads of state proposed
by President Bill Clinton for Seattle in September. But they argued strongly
against the organisation, which established its secretariat in Singapore
this year, having any supra-national powers.
Delegates said it was premature for Asia-Pacific to be viewed as an
homogeneous economic region.
These divisions, however, have done little to calm the European Community's
fears that Apec could emerge as a protectionist regional trade bloc. 'An
Asian-Pacific preferential area would look like an American trade bloc aimed
at the (European) Community,' said Mr Jim Rollo, director of the Royal
Institute of International Affairs in the UK. Some delegates argued that
regional trade associations could provide the catalyst for freer
international trade, but the history of the EC showed that, despite the best
intentions, large regional trade groupings could drift toward protectionism,
Mr Rollo said.

The Canadian government has appointed a prominent Winnipeg businessman to
oversee a new effort to dismantle pervasive non-tariff trade barriers
between the country's 10 provinces, reports Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Mr Arthur Mauro, former chief executive of Investors Group, Canada's biggest
mutual fund distributor, will chair the Internal Trade Secretariat, which
was set up earlier this year so as to co-ordinate domestic trade
liberalisation.
The federal and provincial governments have set a target of June 30, 1994,
for a 'single-market' agreement. Most observers expect, at best, limited
results by then. The Canadian Manufacturers' Assocation has identified about
500 provincial trade barriers, including government procurement preferences,
product standards, marketing boards and curbs on labour mobility.

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US and Mexico may thrash out separate deal
on Nafta issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S trade minister, Mr Thomas Hockin, yesterday prepared to leave
Washington, where talks between US and Mexico were still under way on the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
His departure, to attend a cabinet meeting in Ottawa, fueled speculation
that the US and Mexico were negotiating separate deals in the current talks
over environment, labour, import surges and financing of a US-Mexico border
clean-up.
Officials of the US, Mexico and Canada issued a statement that press reports
of separate deals over the weekend were 'inaccurate, misleading and false'.
Canada has been a firm opponent of a US proposal to create a strong
enforcement mechanism if any of the three governments fail to enforce their
labour or environmental laws. Mexico has backed a proposal to use the
levying of fines for enforcement, but this has been vetoed by key Democrats
in the US Congress.
At the very least, the US and Mexico are expected to agree to some
combination of fines and tariff 'snapbacks' in the event of 'persistent,
systematic and unjustifiable' non-enforcement of environmental laws.
In Congress, there is concern that fighting over Nafta has 'turned intensely
ugly.' US corporations, hostile to labour and environmental enforcement, are
believed to be supplying Mexico with proposals to bring to the bargaining
table.
Ms Lori Wallach, a lawyer of Public Citizen, a citizens' group opposed to
Nafta, predicted there would be 'teeth' in the final agreement over
sanctions to enforce labour and environment agreements, as the Clinton
Administration has often promised, but 'the teeth will be in the large
intestine' at the end of 'a long, twisted, tortuous' dispute settlement
process.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, has made little progress in
satisfying Ms Wallach and other opponents of the pact. Disputes between the
US and Mexico over the environment can drag on for years, critics say,
because there are no precise deadlines for investigations and settlement as
there are for settlement of commercial disputes.
Environmentalists also complain that although the side agreement deals with
environmental protection, conservation issues - such as the controversy over
drift net fishing - are not included.
Labour leaders say they get even less from the side agreements.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Canada's Liberals turn up the heat: The ruling Tories look
vulnerable, but it is early days yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF contributions to political party coffers are a guide, Canada's business
community is preparing for a change in government later this year.
A list of donors to political parties published last month shows that
donations to the Liberal party, which has been in opposition since September
1984, jumped by 11.5 per cent last year to CDollars 7.6m (Pounds 3.95m),
with almost half coming from business donors. By contrast, contributions to
the ruling Progressive Conservative Party slipped by 4 per cent.
The Liberals' improved financial fortunes mirror a perception in political
circles that the Tories face an uphill battle to win a third consecutive
mandate in the next election, which is expected in late September or
October.
Before the Tories swept into office in 1984, the Liberals had been in
government for 42 of the previous 50 years. But for most of the past nine
years, they have been plagued by internal dissension and weak leadership.
Liberals hold 79 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons. Even now, opinion
polls show that while the Liberals are ahead overall, Ms Kim Campbell, who
took over as Tory leader and prime minister in mid-June, is far more popular
than the Liberal leader, Mr Jean Chretien.
Ms Campbell has begun an effort to shake off the legacy of her unpopular
predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. Her performance at the Group of Seven
industrial nations' summit in Tokyo last month made a good impression at
home.
Since then, her advisers have persuaded members of the Senate, the upper
house of Parliament, to reverse an increase in their expense allowances. Ms
Campbell was expected yesterday to propose tighter rules for
parliamentarians' pensions, and a shake-up in the pervasive (but unpopular)
system of political patronage.
Ms Campbell indicated last weekend that she plans a number of other policy
initiatives before setting an election date.
According to one senior adviser, the Campbell-led Tories will further try to
distance themselves from the Mulroney era by unveiling an adjustment
assistance programme for companies and workers hurt by the free-trade pact
which Mr Mulroney negotiated with the US in 1989.
Despite these Tory initiatives, the Liberals' mood is more upbeat than it
has been in years. The Liberals are well ahead in the polls. And the party
believes Ms Campbell will not be unable to shake off the impression that, in
the words of one Liberal MP, she is 'Mulroney in a skirt'.
The party will lose no opportunity in the coming campaign to remind voters
that, under Tory rule, Canada has suffered a deep recession and massive job
losses. They will argue that privatisation and free trade have brought more
costs than benefits. Moves by both Mr Mulroney and Ms Campbell to reform the
generous social security system will be cited as evidence that the
Conservatives are squeezing public spending with little concern for
'ordinary' Canadians.
'The main issue is to tie Campbell to her predecessor's record,' says a
Liberal pollster.
While Ms Campbell is promising to eliminate the CDollars 35bn-a-year federal
budget deficit within five years, Mr Chretien is aiming to cut it to only 3
per cent of gross domestic product, from 5.2 per cent last year.
Meanwhile, the Liberals are the most likely beneficiaries of recent
developments among smaller political parties. Support for the left-leaning
New Democratic Party, which has 43 seats in parliament, has withered, mainly
as a result of the unpopularity of NDP provincial governments in Ontario and
British Columbia.
Disaffected NDP voters are more likely to shift their loyalties to the
Liberals than to the Conservatives.
Another point in the Liberals' favour is that the Tories' strength in Quebec
has been sapped by the emergence of the separatist Bloc Quebecois as a
federal party. Mr Mulroney, who is from Quebec, relied heavily on
nationalist forces not only for votes but also organisational support in the
1984 and 1988 elections.
The Liberals have addressed at least some of the internal problems which
handicapped them in the last two elections. Although they remain divided on
many economic and social issues, they have worked hard to present a more
cohesive platform to the electorate. Talk in some quarters of tearing up the
US-Canada free trade agreement, as advocated in the 1988 campaign, has
evaporated.
One pollster with ties to the Liberals sees one of his main tasks at the
moment to guard the party against over-confidence. With ideology playing a
relatively small role in Canadian politics, voters' minds can change quickly
and often.
Observers point to recent experience in the province of Alberta. Having rid
themselves of an unpopular premier, the Tories came from behind to score a
resounding victory in the June provincial elections.

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand team hunts for export niches in
the east - Trade across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand agency charged with restructuring and privatising east German
industry is using countertrade and joint ventures to stimulate exports
between east German enterprises and former Soviet republics.
Prior to June 1990 trade between the former Soviet Union and east Germany
totalled DM30bn (Pounds 11.6bn). But monetary union in Germany virtually
destroyed the east's trade with Russia and the countries of eastern Europe.
In an attempt to tap the export potential of some east German companies
which once had close links with the Soviet Union, the Treuhand has set up a
team to find markets.
Mr Hero Brahms, vice-chairman of the Treuhand, says: 'Under normal
conditions it would be the company's task to find export possibilities. But
because of the situation in eastern Germany, we are trying to support east
German companies in finding. . . creative solutions which have export
possibilities, irrespective of financial problems.'
Mr Brahms hopes the former Soviet republics will be able to buy east German
products worth DM1m in the short term, while in the long term barter deals
could amount to DM1bn.
The barter deals carry a high risk partly because of the acute shortage of
hard currency in the former Soviet republics and the vulnerability of the
east German economy. 'These creative solutions cannot go on forever. They
are temporary. But we have to support companies if we believe they can
survive,' Mr Brahms says.
Officials at Hermes, Germany's export credit insurance agency, yesterday
said there was little point in backing countertrade if, after six months, an
east German company faced liquidation. 'Dealing with Russia entails a high
risk,' said Mr Hans Janus, a Hermes official.
Last weekend's decision by the federal economics ministry to cut off all
Hermes support to Russia, because of delays in outstanding interest payments
of DM500m, confirms this view. It may also affect the fledgling revival of
barter between east Germany and Russia.
Last year the agency imposed a ceiling of DM5bn on credit guarantees, but
gave priority to east German exporters.

FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Indonesia's power scramble - The battle
for market share in the energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES supplying Indonesia's fast growing electric power sector have
entered a fierce battle for market share. At stake is investment in the
power sector which the World Bank estimates will total Dollars 33bn in the
current decade.
The country's most recent contracts have been for contracts for three
gas-fired power stations in Java worth about Dollars 1.5bn, to be built by
mid-1995.
Indonesia's Government wants to double the grid's capacity in that time to
about 20,000MW. It hopes that one-third of future investment in the national
grid will come from the private sector.
The timetable for new capacity, however, has been upset by slow negotiations
for the large Paiton plant in East Java, which would launch a programme of
privately built, owned and operated stations.
Paiton's first 1,200MW stage, worth Dollars 2bn, had been due for completion
in 1995 but is now unlikely to begin operating before 1998. Already faced
with a substantial backlog of customer connections, PLN, the state-owned
power company, faces an acute power shortage. Last month, the Government
announced negotiations with Mitsubishi and Sumitomo of Japan, and Asea Brown
Boveri (ABB) of Germany, for three gas-fired power stations on Java - to be
owned and operated by PLN - made up of open cycle (solely gas-fired) and
combined cycle (gas-fired and steam-driven) units.
ABB and Mitsubishi will build two 800MW plants at Mawar Tawar, West Java and
Pasuruan, East Java respectively. Sumitomo will construct a 500MW plant at
either Tambak Lorok or Cilacap in Central Java.
PLN says the three stations are being contracted on a repeat-order basis in
recognition of the three companies' proven track record in Indonesia. But
the decision not to widen negotiations to other manufacturers has provoked
squabbling among the foreign companies seeking contracts.
Last month (July), parliamentarians requested the contracts be reviewed
after GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French power equipment company, made a
cut-price uninvited offer to supply the new stations' open cycle units.
'Every time there is a new contract the government says it is a
repeat-order. When will the other manufacturers get a chance? It's about
time other suppliers came in to ensure more competitive pricing,' says an
official close to GEC-Alsthom. He argues the companies which win contracts
for gas-fired plants are operating a cartel, keeping in close contact when
negotiating projects with the Government and lobbying to exclude others.
Members of the alleged cartel point out that GEC-Alsthom participated and
lost in an open tender for two earlier gas-fired stations, the 1,500MW plant
at Gresik in East Java and the 1,180MW plant at Tanjung Priok in Jakarta.
In May, PLN sought government approval for the three stations. PLN said the
companies - ABB and Mitsubishi - - had offered the open cycle units at
Dollars 6m per megawatt.
In early June, GEC-Alsthom wrote to President Suharto offering the open
cycle units at Dollars 5m per megawatt and with an earlier delivery date.
The presidential office initially welcomed the proposal but the company has
since been told by the Ministry of Mines and Energy that its offer will not
be considered.
Government officials say negotiating directly with ABB, Mitsubishi and
Sumitomo is the safest way of ensuring the looming power crisis is avoided.
The three companies are already constructing gas-powered plants in Java.
While items such as land clearance, associated infrastructure and design
specifications could account for some increase in project costs, industry
observers are concerned the government is not always getting value for
money.
The fault may not lie with PLN negotiators who have been overstretched by
the sudden demand for new capacity. To use an open tender process for the
new gas-fired plants would require at least a dozen proposals to be
analysed.
Industry observers say, however, that ministers should reconsider a policy
which favours companies already entrenched in Indonesia and which blocks
other manufacturers wishing to supply the sector.

WATER levels are dropping dramatically in some areas along the swollen
Mississippi River, but there is still enough pressure on water-logged levees
to keep flood-weary residents on edge, AP reports from St Louis.
The river at St Louis had fallen 1.3 feet in 24 hours to 43.6 feet by
yesterday morning, said Mr Lou Chiodini of the Army Corps of Engineers. That
is down from the record crest of 49.4 feet on August 1.
The Mississippi had been forecast to drop below flood stage, which is 30
feet at St Louis, by late August or early September.
High water pressure remains on the levees that have held back the river for
weeks. 'You can breathe a certain sigh of relief but it's not a time to stop
being vigilant,' Mr Chiodini said.
The National Weather Service said much of the Midwest would be without rain
for the next few days, raising hopes that the levees will survive as the
water recedes.
'It's looking better,' a weather service spokesman said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S government yesterday ruled out direct talks with the Tunis-based
Palestine Liberation Organisation and said it would keep negotiating with a
Palestinian peace delegation from the occupied territories.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's comments followed a threat to resign by three
top members of the locally-based Palestinian delegation and speculation that
Israel might agree to direct talks with the PLO because it appeared to be
taking a more moderate stand.
The three negotiators - Mr Faisal Husseini, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Saeb
Erekat - were last night locked in negotiations with senior PLO officials
including Mr Yassir Arafat, the organisation's leader.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, continued to refuse to deny
or confirm resignation reports, fuelling speculation that the Palestinians
from the occupied territories were using the threat of resignation as a way
of increasing pressure on the PLO leaders. Mr Haidar abdel-Shafi, head of
the Palestinian negotiating team, was due to arrive in Tunis from Amman to
join the talks.
'It is a Palestinian problem,' Mr Rabin said. 'It is not our business what
is the composition of the Palestinian delegation as long as it is composed
of residents of the territories.'
Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, when asked whether Israel should
negotiate directly with the PLO, said: 'Everything has its time. This
question too has its time and it is not now. At this stage, there is a
delegation we can negotiate with.' Mr Rabin's government, which has already
ended a ban on private contacts with the PLO, has faced a growing clamour
from the left wing of his Labour party and the Meretz party within his
coalition to agree to talks with Mr Arafat.

GENERAL Colin Powell, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
yesterday American forces would pursue those responsible for the deaths of
four US soldiers in Mogadishu over the weekend, Reuter reports from
Washington.
'Obviously we are interested in going after any of those responsible for the
incident if we can find out who they are,' Gen Powell told reporters.
On Sunday President Bill Clinton vowed to take 'appropriate action' after
Somali gunmen ambushed a UN peacekeepers' convoy and killed four Americans -
the heaviest loss of US life since American troops landed in Somalia in
December.
A faction loyal to fugitive warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, blamed by UN
special envoy Jonthan Howe for recent 'terrorist attacks', has denied
responsibility for the US deaths. Gen Powell said he had no announcement of
any new US policy in Somalia but said security would be tightened by US
forces. About 4,000 US troops remain in Somalia, down from about 22,000
earlier this year.

AS THE only member of Japan's new ministerial line-up who has previously
held a cabinet post, Mr Tsutomu Hata qualifies automatically as its elder
statesman. While this befits the role of foreign minister which he yesterday
assumed, it suggests that his voice will also be influential on economic,
trade and other matters.
Mr Hata, aged 57, leader of the Japan Renewal party which precipitated the
general election by splitting from the long-ruling Liberal Democratic party
in June, was finance minister from November 1991 until last December. There
he presided over a Y10,700bn (Pounds 68bn) government spending programme
aimed at mitigating the effects of economic slowdown.
In the mid-1980s he had held the agriculture portfolio - he represents a
farming constituency in central Japan which has returned him nine times as
an MP - as the markets for beef and oranges were being prised open to
foreign producers. He provoked vexed amusement in Washington by maintaining
that a difference in Japanese intestines made US beef more difficult to
digest.
If that comment was itself hard to swallow, Mr Hata's break with the LDP
shows that he has the stomach for a fight. He could have had the foreign
ministry in April, when party bosses offered him the job in the hope that he
might not defect. Four months on, it is his anyway, along with the deputy
premiership in a coalition charged with performing surgery on the country's
political entrails.
The inward-looking nature of the coalition's agenda, as well as differences
among its seven constituent parties on key aspects of foreign policy, will
make it difficult for him to pursue the heightened role in diplomacy which
the country has in recent years been seeking. In an indication that Mr
Hata's prime policy thrust may be regional rather than global, he said Japan
should seek a reconciliation with its Asian neighbours over the wartime
activities of its imperial forces.
He added that Japan needed to move towards normalising relations with North
Korea. The statement came partly as a sop to the Social Democratic party,
the largest coalition member and the most left-wing, which has traditionally
backed Pyongyang.
But the overture also follows post-cold war shifts in east Asian diplomacy
which last year allowed Beijing, North Korea's long-time backer, to
establish formal ties with Seoul. The Sino-Japanese relationship will be
among the trickiest amid nervousness in Tokyo at evidence that China is
modernising its military hardware and staking claim to strategic outposts.
Last week satellite pictures showing a lengthened Chinese airstrip on the
disputed Paracel islands made front-page news in Japan. Any diplomatic noise
the government makes about such moves is, however, likely to be met by a
sharp reminder from Beijing about the legacy of Japan's own military
expansionism.
Relations with Moscow, meanwhile, remain ensnared in the future of the
Kurile islands at Japan's northern tip, occupied by the Soviet Union at the
end of the second world war. Mr Hata's attention will have been drawn to
this yesterday by a raucous demonstration mounted outside the foreign
ministry by far-right groups demanding the return of the islands to Japan.
Inside, bureaucrats continued to prepare for a twice-postponed visit to
Tokyo by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which may now take place later
this year.
A United Nations General Assembly session which convenes late next month
will help show to what extent Mr Hata will press the case, mounted under the
LDP, for greater recognition of Japan's world stature - in particular, for a
permanent seat on the Security Council.
SDP opposition to the deployment of Japanese troops abroad in UN
peacekeeping missions could cause snags, but he will have an ally in Mr
Keisuke Nakanishi, appointed director general of the country's defence
agency. Mr Nakanishi, 52, is from Mr Hata's JRP and worked behind the scenes
to bring the coalition together.
Around the time of the UN gathering Mr Hata is expected to accompany Mr
Hosokawa to Washington for a summit with President Bill Clinton, and the two
visitors can expect the views of his administration on Japan's need to curb
its trade surplus and further open its markets to be driven home.
The European Community may have to wait its turn to preach a similar lesson,
as Mr Hata yesterday stressed the core nature of the US-Japanese
relationship.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Kumagai likely to follow the LDP policy line: Trade and
Agriculture - As Japan's coalition takes office FT writers assess the likely
policy changes

CONCERN among Japanese bureaucrats that inexperienced politicians would take
the lead in trade policy was alleviated yesterday by the appointment of the
Japan Renewal Party's Mr Hiroshi Kumagai as the minister for International
Trade and Industry, and Mr Eijiro Hata, also of the JRP, as agricultural
minister.
Mr Kumagai, 53, is an advocate of deregulation and decentralisation, and has
been critical of the cohesion among politicians, bureaucrats and businesses.
He is also known as the right hand man of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the
JRP, and has nurtured international links during his stint at Harvard
University.
He is known for his outspokenness and is famous for openly criticising Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, former prime minister, for his economic policy. However, as
a former trade bureaucrat and ex-Liberal Democratic Party member, Mr Kumagai
is likely to inherit the policies of the LDP and produce few surprises.
He yesterday reiterated the line of the Miti mandarins on numerical targets
for the country's imports. He said managed trade would counter Japan's
direction of deregulation and market liberalisation.
Instead it was Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new foreign minister, who shed some
light on the new government's direction on trade. He expressed the need for
Japan to take 'tough and painful' decisions to open its markets to avert the
consequences of trade friction with the US. 'Not only the government, but
private industries and the people must see that it is not good for Japan to
be sole winner,' he said.
Mr Hata suggested that Japan would take a tougher stance on trade, as he
said an impression that Japan is being bullied into concessions by the US
would create 'extremely dangerous' feelings on both sides. For those who had
hoped Mr Hosokawa's rise to power would lead to an opening of the country's
rice market, the coalition's official line of keeping the market closed has
been disappointing. Mr Hosokawa's Japan New Party had initially called for
the liberalisation of the rice market.
Most of the members of the JRP, the core of the coalition, are supported by
rural constituencies, while the Social Democratic Party is also beholden to
farmers' interests. Mr Hata said it was simplistic to think Japan's rice
import ban alone was preventing conclusion of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade talks.
Mr Eijiro Hata said he would respect the ban on rice imports. While Mr Hata,
aged 64, has had close links to the post and telecommunications ministry,
and has been involved in the privatisation of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, his background lies in a rural area in southern Japan.
Mr Kumagai yesterday repeatedly stressed the importance of the successful
completion of the Uruguay Round. Officials at Miti claim that there will be
a more international focus on policies. However, to lead his former
colleagues at the trade ministry to a new openness, while fighting off
pressure from Japan's western peers, Mr Kumagai will need to be more than Mr
Ozawa's right hand man.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Kenya's quest for credibility meets a sceptical eye: Western
donors are unconvinced by attempts to end corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Micah Cheserem, Kenya's new central bank governor, sought recently to
reassure an International Monetary Fund team in Nairobi of the Government's
zeal in trying to stamp out financial corruption. His assurances met with
scepticism.
Kenya has some way to go to win credibility with its donors, even after the
past turbulent weeks in which two local banks were closed and the Central
Bank's two most senior employees sacked.
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, ordered the closure last month of
the Exchange Bank and the Pan African Bank - known as 'political banks' for
their ties to influential politicians - after external audits, carried out
at the insistence of the IMF, revealed serious financial malpractice.
Exchange Bank is alleged to have defrauded the Central Bank of millions of
dollars by claiming export rebates on fictitious shipments of gold and
diamond jewellery.
In addition, the Central Bank is owed Dollars 156m by the two closed banks
and a third institution under investigation, Delphis Bank, according to an
internal Central Bank memo leaked to the local press. The three local banks
acquired high-yielding treasury bills with unsecured cash advances from the
Central Bank. There is no evidence that the money has been repaid.
'Bank overdrafts to financial institutions are leading to massive inflation,
the need to devalue the currency, instability in the macro-economic scene,'
Mr Edward Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, said recently.
'This deters investment, it also raises questions about the management of
the economy which are more longstanding.'
Such squandering of public money is embarrassing to a government that is
trying to win back foreign aid suspended in November 1991. Kenya is now more
than Dollars 550m (Pounds 369m) in arrears to institutions and creditor
governments on its debt service obligations.
President Daniel arap Moi is under pressure from the World Bank, which has
told the president privately that Kenya has one last chance to clean up its
economic management. The country's largest donor will pull out of the
country if it fails to do so, it said.
While there is some confidence among western bankers in Mr Mudavadi's
determination to root out corruption, many Kenyans believe that the powerful
men behind the President have a different agenda. They believe Exchange Bank
and Pan African Bank were sacrificed because they had already exhausted
their usefulness. Few believe the 'intensive investigations' promised by the
finance minister will result in arrests, prosecutions or convictions.
'Why was (former Central Bank governor Eric) Kotut given another public
sinecure?' asks Mr Peter Waturere, managing editor of the weekly Economic
Review. 'His forced resignation was a cosmetic measure. I don't think it
reflects well on the government's commitment to cleaning up corruption.'
Another banker says: 'What we are seeing now is a lot of transparency with
no accountability.'
Not a day goes by without newspapers or opposition members of parliament
denouncing new scams or documenting evidence of graft within at the heart of
government.
'Western agencies and donors,' the Daily Nation said in an editorial, 'will
not be disposed to rush in and restart full aid support when (a banking)
scandal of these proportions remains not just unresolved but fundamentally
unaddressed.' Some donors worry that the two top positions at the Central
Bank are now being held by men with no experience in banking or central bank
management.
Others however, say they are encouraged that at least some reform has taken
place in the past four months. Special waivers in the Banking Act, which
allowed the 'political banks' to function with impunity, have been scrapped.
Import licences have been abolished. Exporters are now allowed to keep
foreign earnings in retention accounts, which has in turn reduced the
practice of under-invoicing.
But many problems remain. The country's annual audit of its public accounts,
published last month, is a sorry catalogue of the government's inefficiency
and mismanagement. As well as the Exchange Bank scandal, it documents the
use of National Social Security Funds to buy houses from a private developer
at inflated prices; irregularities in the Health Ministry's public tendering
for drugs; and millions of dollars and sterling paid by the Office of the
Vice-President to overseas companies for the procurement of equipment that
was never received.
Mr Jaycox's appeal to Kenya last month appeared final: 'We want Kenya to run
its economy,' he said. 'We don't want to have to come out to Kenya every few
months and look over everybody's shoulder to check the books.'

FT  10 AUG 93 / Ailing economy poised to trigger spending package: Finance -
As Japan's coalition takes office FT writers assess the likely policy
changes
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN will consider introducing another spending package later this year to
stimulate its ailing economy, but there is no need for an immediate
reduction in official interest rates, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance
minister, said yesterday.
Within hours of taking his post in the cabinet unveiled by Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa, Mr Fujii was forced to correct a suggestion he had made
early in the day that the new government would not increase the country's
controversial 3 per cent value-added tax.
He later said the government was not considering an increase in the tax to
fund another stimulatory spending package this year, but hinted that an
increase might be necessary in the longer term as part of a restructuring of
the taxation system.
Mr Fujii, 61, is confronted by an economy that appears to have hit the
second of the double-dips in its downturn, prompting business leaders
yesterday to remind the coalition to keep an eye on growth as well as on its
stated priority of political reform.
The appointment of Mr Fujii has at least reassured finance ministry
bureaucrats, who feared the new government might be tempted to spend its way
out of economic trouble.
Mr Fujii is a former official of the ministry's budget bureau, and insisted
yesterday that the government would not issue deficit-covering bonds to
increase its scope for spending in a budget under preparation for the year
beginning next April.
The finance ministry has already warned other ministries that spending will
increase by no more than 3 per cent, and Mr Fujii appeared to support that
low ceiling, even though the coalition has talked of increasing social
welfare spending and foreign aid contributions.
Mr Fujii graduated from Tokyo university in 1955 and after his stint at the
finance ministry was elected to parliament in 1977. He is one of the ex-LDP
officials who make up the core of the new cabinet, having left the party
this year to join the Japan Renewal party.
In his first press conference yesterday he handled questions deftly, but
later found that his answer on the value-added tax appeared to close off all
options for an increase, so he issued a statement to clarify the
government's position.
The coalition partners are obviously in favour of growth, but Mr Fujii will
find that he must tread warily in discussing tax policy, as the Social
Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, would prefer the
value-added tax to be scrapped.
Asked whether the official discount rate should be cut from the present 2.5
per cent, Mr Fujii said there was no need for an immediate reduction,
although he did not intend to tell the Bank of Japan how to handle interest
rate policy.
Ms Manae Kubota, the new director-general of the economic planning agency
(EPA), will be responsible, along with Mr Fujii, for guiding policy. She is
also aware of the influence of Japan's bureaucrats, having worked at the
labour ministry before entering politics.
The EPA has been persistently optimistic in the face of signs that personal
consumption is falling sharply and Japanese companies are in for a fourth
year of declining profits. While private institutions forecast growth this
year at around 1.5 per cent, the agency has set a target of 3.3 per cent.
Ms Kubota, 68, a member of the SDP, said yesterday the economy was still
digesting a Y13,200bn (Pounds 84.6bn) stimulatory package announced in
April, and this spending should be completed before the government began
planning another package. The government has been condemned for pumping
money into public works projects, without addressing the fall in personal
consumption and corporate capital spending.
Ms Kubota indicated that more attention should be paid to the needs of
consumers.

FT  10 AUG 93 / IMF yet to agree Pakistan package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN International Monetary Fund delegation left Pakistan last night without
reaching agreement with the interim government on economic measures which
would be backed by IMF loans.
Mr Saeed Qureshi, secretary general of the finance ministry, said there were
'no major ticklish issues left'. But he conceded that details on revenue
collection and control of government spending needed to be finalised.
The caretaker prime minister, Mr Moeen Qureshi, is expected to announce
economic reforms on Saturday which will include steps to increase revenues
and reduce expenditure to cut the country's large budget deficit.
Among measures being considered is a larger wealth tax on rich landowners,
whose political influence has enabled them to escape heavy taxation. The
government may also seek to merge up to 21 federal ministries into other
ministries.
The government hopes that the measures will secure the IMF's agreement to
provide Dollars 1.2bn of loans. Mr Mohammad El-Erian, the IMF mission
leader, will brief colleagues in Washington before a recommendation is sent
to the fund's board. Mr Qazi Aleemullah, Pakistan's finance secretary, said
there was a 'more than 80 per cent chance' of agreement.
Pakistan expects Dollars 1bn from a combination of the IMF's Extended
Finance Facility and Extended Structural Adjustment Facility over three
years. The government is also seeking up to Dollars 200m as a Structural
Adjustment Facility to meet short-term balance of payment needs, of which
the first tranche could be made available in September. Ratification of the
longer-term package would await the arrival of a new government after
October elections.

TAIWAN'S highest watchdog body yesterday impeached 15 officials of two
state-run companies for alleged involvement in a multi-million dollar
construction scandal, its spokesman said, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The Control Yuan approved motions to impeach five current and former
officials of the state-run Tang Eng Iron Works, including company president
Andrew Yen, for allegedly inflating by USDollars 11.2m the value of a
contract to build a waste water treatment system for Chinese Petroleum, the
spokesman said. The project was awarded in 1991 to Brown and Root
International, the US construction company, which subcontracted it to Tang
Eng and other groups.
Ten current and former Chinese Petroleum officials were also impeached,
including former president Kuan Yung-shih, now chairman of the state-run
China Petrochemical Development, the spokesman said.
The Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries will decide what
action to take against the 15, he said.

HONG KONG'S attorney general has relaunched an inquiry into the explosion
which killed two people at a Hong Kong power plant owned by China Light and
Power (CLP) and Exxon, following accusations that the companies withheld
information from the original investigation, writes Simon Davies in Hong
Kong.
The companies are currently facing a USDollars 125m (Pounds 83.8m) Texas
court action by their former legal representative, Mr Michael Ford, who
claims that he was dismissed during the original inquest after he discovered
that vital evidence was being back. CLP has stated that Mr Ford's
accusations are 'unfounded and wholly without merit' and has obtained an
injunction in Hong Kong to prevent him from releasing information obtained
during his employment by the group.
However, allegations in a court petition in Alice, Texas, had put Mr Jeremy
Mathews, Hong Kong's attorney general, under pressure to re-open the
investigation. He yesterday issued a letter to the coroner, instructing him
to act as though the initial inquiry had never been concluded.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Bundesbank criticised by chief economist of Germany's
largest commercial bank
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW FISHER

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK has been criticised by the chief economist of Germany's
largest commercial bank for relying on 'unsuitable indicators' in the
pursuit of its monetary policies, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
Speaking a week after what he called the 'de facto suspension' of the
European monetary system, Mr Norbert Walter of Deutsche Bank said M3, the
broad money supply indicator targeted by the central bank, was obviously
distorted and devalued as an indicator.
Yet the Bundesbank still used M3 as a basis for its policies, he said in a
newspaper interview. He also charged the Bundesbank with forgetting its own
analysis when using inflation rates as an argument for its actions. This
showed monetary policy took two-and-a-half years to influence prices.
Moreover, the inflation rate was over-stated as a result of the many rises
in indirect taxes. German inflation exceeds 4 per cent a year and M3 has
been growing at an annualised rate of around 7 per cent; these are above the
levels desired by the Bundesbank, which had thus been reluctant to speed up
interest rate cuts. However, Mr Walter did not blame the bank's high
interest rates for curbing economic growth in Europe. 'Inflation,
unemployment and the budgetary strains resulting from these are mainly
caused by erroneous economic and wage policies,' he said.

THE Bank of France cut overnight interest rates slightly yesterday. However,
it underlined its cautious approach to lowering borrowing costs despite the
increased room for manoeuvre resulting from the effective flotation of the
franc.
The bank cut the interest rate for 24-hour funds from 10 per cent to 9.75.
The 5-10 day borrowing rate, suspended at the end of July and reintroduced
last week, was unchanged at 10 per cent.
The franc weakened following the announcement, slipping below FFr3.50 to the
D-Mark. It is now more than seven centimes below its previous European
exchange rate mechanism floor of FFr3.4305. The French currency's
fluctuation bands within the ERM were widened from 2.25 per cent to 15 per
cent at the beginning of the month following sustained speculative attacks.
'It is a step towards lower rates,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at
Banque Indosuez in Paris, referring to yesterday's move. 'But it shows that
the French government is keeping a close eye on the foreign exchange
markets.'
The importance of exchange rate considerations in French monetary policy
reflects the fact that Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has staked his
credibility on a strong franc. It also reflects the central bank's desire to
rebuild reserves severely depleted in its attempt to defend the franc.
The need for continued adherence to a strong franc policy was expressed
yesterday in an open letter to Le Monde newspaper. Signed by Jean-Claude Le
Franc, described as a pseudonym for a group of senior French civil servants,
the letter lamented the 'dislocation of the EMS' and said that France's
right-wing political parties must not loosen monetary policy or let the
franc fall.
The letter, which praised the late prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregevoy who
defended the franc against two assaults, appeared critical of Mr Balladur
for failing to do so. But political analysts in Paris said the letter could
also represent support for Mr Balladur who faces pressure from within his
gaullist RPR party for rapid interest rate cuts and a more expansionary
economic policy.
Most economists expect the government to cut interest rates in an attempt to
revive the recession-hit economy, but will do so gradually. Its strategy is
expected to involve a continued easing in 24-hour rates so as to bring call
market rates down from their current level of about 10 per cent.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Nato pulls punches over air strikes: Alliance warns the
Bosnian Serbs but holds back on military action

MR Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, yesterday warned Bosnian Serbs
that the alliance was prepared to take military action, including air
strikes, if the siege of Sarajevo was not lifted.
However, a four-hour meeting of the Nato Council in Brussels stopped short
of ordering the strikes. The organisation insisted further UN consultation
and Nato meetings were needed before action could be taken. It said any air
strikes would be limited to supporting humanitarian relief efforts and
should not be interpreted as a decision to intervene militarily in the
Bosnian conflict.
In a concession to the concerns of some European countries, it was agreed
the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, would decide when the
first air strike would take place.
Mr Worner said Nato would take four criteria into account in assessing
whether Serbs had lifted the siege - the blockade of water and electricity
in Sarajevo, the shelling of the city, the 'strangulation' of other safe
havens and attacks on UN forces. These would be monitored daily, he added.
In Geneva President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia met the peace conference's
co-chairmen in the wake of their suspension last week of peace talks amid
Bosnian protests over Serb seizure of Mounts Bjelasnica and Igman, key
mountains near Sarajevo.
Later Mr Izetbegovic said he had refused to resume talks with his Serb and
Croat adversaries until Serb forces withdrew from these mountains.
The Moslem president made clear he had not met Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, during the talks. 'It was only talks with the
co-chairmen. . . because we established that the Serbs did not withdraw from
Mount Bjelasnica.'
He said he would return to the negotiating table today but would not restart
direct talks on future borders of three ethnic republics until Serb forces
completed their pull-out, as promised, from the strategic high ground around
Sarajevo.
After the meeting, Mr Karadzic criticised international calls for military
intervention against Serb targets. 'The western troops are jeopardising the
conference. It gives the Moslem side a chance to stall the talks by waiting
for western attacks against our positions.'
Diplomats say Mr Izetbegovic is holding out for Nato air strikes against
Serb targets. But some believe a firm decision on the strikes would be
untimely at the moment. They cite uncertainty over whether Serb troops have
withdrawn from mounts Bjelasnica and Igman.
A spokesman for the peace talks said the Serb flag was no longer waving over
Bjelasnica. UN officials, however, could not confirm that Serb forces had
pulled back from Mount Igman, which is of greater strategic significance for
the Bosnian army because it controls a crucial supply route to the besieged
capital.
After the talks in Brussels, US officials said they would meet Mr
Izetbegovic today to dissuade him from assuming that the threat of air
strikes would provide salvation for Bosnian Moslems.

NATO OFFICIALS were yesterday engaged in a feverish round of
behind-the-scenes negotiations as ambassadors for the 16 alliance members
met in Brussels to discuss the logistics of air strikes against Serbs in
Bosnia.
But with the situation in Sarajevo confused following the partial withdrawal
of Serb forces from Mount Bjelasnica, one of the strategic heights around
the city, the Canadian, British and French delegations reiterated concern
that air strikes could endanger troops on the ground.
Another complicating factor emerged when it was revealed French troops had
been deployed on Mt Igman, parts of which are still Serb-occupied.
After a week of anxious diplomatic discussions, Nato officials yesterday
said the alliance had broad agreement on the military structure for the
threatened air strikes.
The US delegation hailed the agreement as a diplomatic breakthrough,
although it fell short of original proposals. An official said: 'This entire
initiative is President Clinton's'
Later, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned that Nato was
ready to take 'forceful action' against Bosnian Serbs. 'The alliance now has
in place all the means necessary to take forceful action against the Serbs
should they not cease their intolerable behaviour,' he said.
Nato officials said the decision was largely the result of intensive
bilateral discussions between the US, Canadian, French and British in the
days - and hours - up to the meeting. The draft declaration had, they added,
been largely drawn up by these four countries.
Nevertheless, Nato sources yesterday pointed out that differences remained
among the allies in the crucial definition of what type of action would be
needed by the Serbs to avert air strikes, and what was necessary for the air
strikes to go ahead.
'Everyone says that air strikes should be used as a last resort. The problem
lies in agreeing the last resort,' said one Nato official.
The military plan proposes a series of graduated options for air strikes and
specific targets that might be attacked.
However, Nato officials yesterday refused to detail what these were,
although they stressed that any response would be proportional and that the
targets would only be within Bosnia, but could include targets outside the
Sarajevo area.
Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: In a statement which suggested more German
caution about western military intervention than apparent in recent
government pronouncements, Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that any air
strikes must take into account consequences for civilians.
Any attempt to end the fighting in former Yugoslavia with military means
would unleash a war with catastrophic consequences. But he supported Mr
Clinton's proposal for limited air strikes against specific military
targets, if backed by the UN Security Council.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Commission holds line on Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission remains adamant. Despite siren calls from London and
other Euro-sceptical quarters, EC officials insist there will no fundamental
shift in strategy in response to the de facto suspension of the exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Jacques Delors made clear during last Friday's special meeting of the
European Commission that the EC must 'tough out' the latest crisis - mainly
by using the tools offered by the Maastricht treaty for reinforcing economic
and monetary co-operation within the Community.
The Commission president is also reported to be pinning some hope on a
Franco-German political initiative before the EC summit in Brussels in
December. This would serve to show the rest of the Community that the
Franco-German alliance remains in good working order, but it would also
demonstrate that European monetary union remains on track.
Recent comment in the British and US press about a permanent rift between
the French and Germans in the run-up to the ERM crisis is dismissed inside
the Commission as 'wishful thinking'. The official view is that
Franco-German differences were not so serious as to overwhelm the European
monetary system. 'The structures remain, even if (some of) the rules have
changed,' said one official.
Mr Delors recognises, however, that the ERM crisis has created a vacuum in
monetary co-operation. This explains the importance which he attaches to two
separate reports which the Commission will publish before next January 1,
starting-point for Emu's second stage.
The first report will focus on the progress which the 12 member states have
made on economic and monetary convergence; the second will set out the main
political and economic guidelines for the Community, to be adopted by a
qualified majority vote of the Twelve.
According to EC monetary officials, both these reports should be used to
define the EC's future route to Emu as set out in Maastricht. The British
proposal to revive the 'hard Ecu' is likely to get short shrift in Brussels.
One option to convince the financial markets that the Community is serious
about monetary union would be to narrow the ERM's newly widened fluctuation
bands. These were fixed at 15 per cent nine days ago to halt speculation
against the franc and weaker ERM currencies; but EC officials note with
satisfaction that Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark are all seeking to return
to their 'narrow bands' rather than rushing towards lower interest rates.
Another favoured option is to strike a deal on the location of the European
Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European central bank, which would
supervise a putative single EC currency. Such a bargain would also include a
'big name' to run the EMI, most likely a current EC central bank governor,
but possibly an outsider.
The policy is characteristic of Mr Delors, a man who believes that a little
pain is often necessary for true salvation. It is also reminiscent of a
certain former British prime minister who declared, with similar conviction,
that 'there is no alternative'.

FT  10 AUG 93 / The Hard Ecu and All That: a Good Thing?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT is the hard Ecu? It is an idea for a new, parallel European currency
dreamed up by Britain in 1990 as its contribution to the debate over
European monetary union. It was dropped after opposition from the rest of
the EC which believed it to be a diversionary tactic aimed at camouflaging
Britain's lack of interest in Emu. But with the Maastricht process thrown
into disarray by the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, the hard Ecu
could come back on to the agenda.
Why would anyone want hard Ecus? They would bridge the gap between national
currencies, such as the D-Mark and sterling, and a new single currency for
Europe to be ushered in later. They would be used by business people,
tourists and anyone buying and selling goods and services in different parts
of Europe. Circulating in parallel with national currencies and freely
convertible, hard Ecus would perform a function similar to Esperanto in
languages.
Who is backing the hard Ecu? The Institute of Directors, a free-market UK
pressure group, thinks it great news for businesses, especially small ones.
The Treasury and prime minister's office are playing it cool. Mr Norman
Lamont, the accident-prone former chancellor, is an enthusiastic backer -
which may not do much for the currency's chances. More positively,
supporters of the currency reckon Mr Edouard Balladur, who took over as
French prime minister earlier this year, said nice things about it while in
opposition.
What about critics? If the hard Ecu ever took off, banks would lose a
fortune by the reduction in money-changing fees. So don't expect too many
plaudits from them. The Bundesbank does not like the hard Ecu either. In its
view, there is a strong, freely circulating currency that could be used
across Europe - the D-Mark.
Who would issue hard Ecus? This could be a job for the European Monetary
Institute, a souped-up committee of European central bank governors, which
is due to be set up on January 1 in an as-yet undecided location. Under the
Maastricht guidelines, the EMI is due eventually to become Europe's central
bank, in charge of pan-European interest rates and a single currency.
But what would happen to the Ecu already in existence? The existing Ecu
(European currency unit) was invented in 1979 and is a purely artificial
currency based on a 'basket' or set weights of national currencies. At
present the D-Mark accounts for about 30 per cent of the Ecu and sterling
12. Although banks, big corporations and governments use Ecus for settling
international transactions and for borrowing money, the currency has never
caught on as a spending unit in the real world. Less than 1 per cent of EC
trade is paid for using Ecus. You cannot use Ecus (worth 75.2p) in shops.
So how would hard Ecus differ from 'basket' Ecus? The governments behind the
hard Ecu would guarantee that it would never be devalued against the
strongest national currency - essentially the D-Mark. They would use their
foreign currency reserves and set interest rates to keep the hard Ecu
strong. This is a completely different system to the one governing the
basket Ecu - which no single body administers and whose value changes over
time.
Why is Mr John Major, the prime minister, dusting off the hard Ecu files?
Reviving the proposals could help Britain maintain it has a solid set of
proposals to help in the aftermath of the ERM fiasco. By underlining the
pragmatic nature of the proposal that is basically to do with helping
business, Mr Major could steer a middle way between the warring factions of
the Conservative party over Europe.
What happens now? Britain is expected to start detailed conversations with
the rest of Europe over the hard Ecu in the autumn. Like the 1960s England
soccer player Martin Peters, the hard Ecu could be a phenomenon ahead of its
time, but which eventually is a hard act to beat.

Bosnia.
But with the situation in Sarajevo confused following the partial withdrawal
of Serb forces from Mount Bjelasnica, one of the strategic heights around

After a week of anxious diplomatic discussions, Nato officials yesterday
said the alliance had broad agreement on the military structure for the
threatened air strikes.
This is expected to place operations under the control of the UN, with
authorisation coming from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general.
The outline agreement represents an American concession to European
concerns; Washington had earlier demanded that Nato be able to initiate air
strikes.
Mr Jacques Blot, French ambassador to Nato, said yesterday that any action
had to be in accordance with the UN resolutions and 'that the first air
strike must be authorised by the secretary-general'.
Nevertheless, it emerged last night that another Nato meeting and further
talks with the UN would probably be required before any strikes could be
authorised.
Officials admit that divisions remain between Europe the US about when
strikes might be needed.
'Everyone says that air strikes should be used as a last resort. The problem
lies in agreeing the last resort,' said one Nato official.
Another official added: 'What the US wants now is not entirely clear to us.
There have been different signals from Washington recently. But we will not
go ahead with anything that endangers our troops.'
With French troops forming the bulk of the UN force in Sarajevo, the French
delegation in Brussels stressed it would only agree to air strikes if they
had the full support of UN commanders on the ground.
'We are not making war in Bosnia.
'This must be a clear signal for the Moslems. We are there for the
humanitarian process,' Mr Blot stressed.
Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: In a statement which suggested more German
caution about western military intervention than has been apparent in recent
government pronouncements, Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night warned that any
air strikes must take into account consequences for the civilian population.
He said any attempt to end the fighting in former Yugoslavia with military
means would unleash a war with catastrophic consequences. Mr Kohl gave his
support, however, to President Bill Clinton's proposal for limited air
strikes against specific military targets - provided they were backed by a
decision of the UN Security Council.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Investors set to recharge E German energy sector: A total of
DM46bn is waiting to be spent, mainly by the domestic utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE way has been cleared for an investment programme totalling DM46bn
(Pounds 17.8bn) to upgrade the energy sector in eastern Germany and to
privatise the region's utilities.
The investments, to be made by east Germany's principal utility, Vereinigte
Energiewerke, or Veag, and by west Germany's main utility companies, will
follow agreement by the last of eastern Germany's 164 local councils to
accept the Stromvertrag. The latter effectively created a monopoly over the
generation and distribution of electricity in the east of the country. .
However, its restrictive nature will make it extremely difficult for
foreigners to invest in the region's utilities.
Veag, which operates the high voltage transmission network in eastern
Germany, has earmarked DM25bn for modernising power generation plant fuelled
by brown coal, or lignite. It will also link the eastern and western high
voltage grid.
Germany's three largest utilities - RWE Energie, Bayernwerk, and
PreussenElektra, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Veba, Germany's energy-based
conglomerate - and Veba Kraftwerke Ruhr, also owned by Veba, plan to spend
DM21bn on building or upgrading the east's power stations, to be fuelled
mostly by lignite. Combined, the investments will give the region a total
annual capacity of 12,300MW.
Few foreign investors have been able to obtain a foothold in eastern German
utilities. Exceptions are Britain's PowerGen, and the Minneapolis-based NRG
utility company, which together are negotiating to buy the giant Mibrag
lignite mines and a stake in a power station at Schkopau, near Leipzig.
This is because the sector's future has been mapped out by the Stromvertrag
agreed in August 1990 between Bonn, the last East German administration and
the West German utilities. This not only creates an effective monopoly but
also inhibits the Treuhand privatisation agency from opening up the
utilities sector to any competition. For example, under the Stromvertrag:
Germany's three largest utilities, known as the Big Three, were given a
combined 75 per cent stake in Veag, which means they control access to the
high voltage grid in eastern Germany. While Veag is under the control of the
Treuhand, which will sell it later this year, it cannot change its ownership
structure. Along with west Germany's five smaller utility companies, the Big
Three have secured majority stakes of 51 per cent in eastern Germany's 15
regional distribution networks.
East Germany's local councils are allowed to own only 49 per cent of the
region's 15 utilities. The remaining 51 per cent is technically owned by
west Germany's eight utilities. The east's regional utilities are also under
the Treuhand which is currently selling off the 51 per cent stakes. But
again, the Stromvertrag does not permit a change in the ownership structure.
East Germany's regional utilities must buy 70 per cent of their power from
Veag over the next 20 years. The remaining 30 per cent of their needs can be
generated locally.
For two years, several local councils challenged the Stromvertrag on the
grounds that they had owned 100 per cent of public assets before they had
been expropriated by the east German Communists in 1952. Essentially, the
councils wanted access to the lucrative business of power generation. For
their part, west Germany's utilities defended this structure on the grounds
that their large investment in the east had to be underwritten by guaranteed
energy sales.
Although Germany's constitutional court ruled against the councils, a
compromise was reached last month giving them the right to their assets
provided they sold their 49 per cent stake in the utilities. The money
raised would allow them to build their own power plants, but they will first
need a licence to do so.
There could be a chance for foreign investors to buy a share of these 49 per
cent stakes, but Mr Winfried Mathes, from Deutsche Bank Research, is not
optimistic. He said other local councils would have first option on them,
followed by the eight west German utilities.
'There is hardly any chance for foreign investors to get hold of these
stakes,' said Mr Mathes. However, they had the right to buy a share of, or
co-operate with local councils in generating 30 per cent of local energy
needs. They could also buy brown coal fields, later selling a stake in them
to a west German utility in return for access to distribution and the high
voltage grid.
The monopoly enjoyed by west German utilities in the east carries a high
risk: energy consumption is still falling because the region's industry is
still collapsing. According to a utility expert: 'The Stromvertrag provides
guaranteed electricity sales. But the massive investment plans could exceed
demand if there is no new industry created. This worries domestic and
foreign investors. Indeed, if no economic upturn is in sight, west German
utilities might cut back their investment commitments in the region.'

THE UK's decision to revive proposals for a hard Ecu to trade alongside
Europe's national currencies drew a cool response from the European
Commission yesterday,
Although there was no official reaction to the British idea, EC officials
made clear that it would most likely meet the same kind of opposition from
Brussels which helped to sink the plan during negotiations on the Maastricht
treaty two years ago.
Despite the de facto suspension of the exchange rate mechanism, the
Commission is not ready to consider a British proposal which would be
tantamount to withdrawing the Maastricht timetable for European monetary
union and going back to the drawing board.
Monetary officials in France, which has previously been cool towards the
proposal of a hard Ecu, declined to comment on the proposal. But they
emphasised France's continuing commitment to the existing timetable for
monetary union, despite the widening of fluctuation bands within the
exchange rate mechanism.
A French finance ministry spokesman said the ERM would be able to return to
narrow bands before very long and that convergence with Germany remained the
objective of the French government.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, recently said that 'the
principle of the EMS has been maintained' and that France was preparing a
convergence plan in line with the Maastricht treaty. He said the plan would
be ready by the end of the month.
A Commission spokesman said British plans for the hard Ecu were still
confined to news reports from London. Until Mr John Major's government
submitted its proposals for improving economic co-operation in the EC, 'we
have absolutely no comment'.
Other officials in Brussels suggested that Mr Major's revival of the hard
Ecu was aimed primarily at filling the political and economic vacuum created
by the recent ERM crisis.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Bundesbank told it should drop reliance on M3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK has been criticised by the chief economist of Germany's
largest commercial bank for relying on 'unsuitable indicators' in the
pursuit of its monetary policies.
Speaking a week after what he called the 'de facto suspension' of the
European monetary system, Mr Norbert Walter of Deutsche Bank said M3, the
broad money supply indicator targeted by the central bank, was obviously
distorted and devalued as an indicator.
Yet the Bundesbank still used M3 as a basis for its policies, he said in a
newspaper interview. He also charged the Bundesbank with forgetting its own
analysis when using inflation rates as an argument for its actions.
This showed monetary policy took two-and-a-half years to influence prices.
Moreover, the inflation rate was over-stated as a result of the many rises
in indirect taxes. German inflation exceeded 4 per cent a year and M3 had
been growing at an annualised rate of around 7 per cent; these were above
the levels desired by the Bundesbank, which had thus been reluctant to speed
up interest rate cuts.
However, Mr Walter did not blame the Bundesbank's high interest rates for
curbing economic growth in Europe. 'Inflation, unemployment and the
budgetary strains resulting from these are mainly caused by erroneous
economic and wage policies,' he said.
Instead of using German unification in 1990 as an opportunity to set new
economic priorities, dismantle state regulations and avoid tax increases,
Germany had transferred its complex system to east Germany. 'This is what
caused the major problems.'
Without directly criticising Bundesbank policies, Mr Walter said it was no
longer possible to operate a national monetary policy. 'The Bundesbank must
take account in its actions of their effect on economic policies abroad.

Striking Dutch bargemen returned to work yesterday after a six-week
stoppage, but said they may resume their actions in three months if a
dispute over cargo allocation is not settled, writes Ronald van de Krol in
Amsterdam.
The independent barge owner-operators have been blocking some river traffic
and refusing to take cargoes since June to press their demands that
'tourderole', a traditional cargo allocation system for shipments from the
Netherlands to Belgium, be written into Dutch law.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Italian mamas turn new leaf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian 'mama' - once a byword for big, bouncy, babies - has turned a
new leaf, according to new population projections from the United Nations,
writes Haig Simonian.
The average fertility rate of Italian women is expected to drop to 1.3 per
head in the period 1990-1995, according to the UN's World Population Report.
That puts Italy ahead of the rest of the world in terms of declining family
sizes. Even mothers in other industrialised European countries, such as
Germany, where childbirth has been steadily falling, are still having more
babies than the Italians.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new executives running Italy's heavily indebted Ferruzzi group may be
planning fresh legal steps against their predecessors and members of the
controlling Ferruzzi family, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The prospect of further action follows a stream of allegations in leaked
documents which indicate former executives of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin)
and its big Montedison industrial offshoot operated an illicit system of
parallel funding, based on bank loans to obscure Montedison subsidiaries.
The money raised was allegedly used for various means, including covering up
commodity trading losses and meeting the personal needs of Ferruzzi family
members.
Ferfin's new board is meeting today to re-examine its financial position.
Tomorrow Montedison's board will meet to consider further legal steps.
Earlier this month the company won court approval to freeze up to L500bn
(Pounds 209m) in assets from former executives.

<TEXT>
A US DIPLOMAT has been shot dead in the strife-torn republic of Georgia, the
first western official to die in the political turmoil in the former Soviet
Union, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Fred Woodruff, a regional affairs officer, was hit in the forehead by a
bullet as he was being driven by the security chief of the Georgian leader,
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. The attack took place 7km outside Tbilisi as they
were returning from what Itar-Tass news agency described as a sight-seeing
trip.
'It must have been the work of professionals,' one western diplomat said.
Mr Shevardnadze, who has himself escaped unhurt from similar attacks, cited
the killing as yet another argument for the emergency powers he has been
seeking since parliament, which he heads, forced out the government last
week.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Drugs groups face call to cut prices by 2.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS GROUPS expect to be told today that prices paid by the UK government
will be cut across the board by 2.5 per cent.
The price cut will be part of a package aimed at controlling the National
Health Service drugs bill while encouraging the industry, one of the UK's
top exporting sectors.
Executives of drugs companies will be told the details of the package this
afternoon. They must agree its terms before the measures can be implemented.
The new package, which has involved renegotiating the voluntary agreement
overseeing industry profits - the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme -
is understood to be mostly favourable to the industry.
The development follows the announcement yesterday by a big manufacturer
that it had slashed the UK price of one of its best-selling medicines to
avoid being put on an NHS blacklist.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American pharmaceuticals group, also said it
would think twice before launching certain drugs in the UK in future.
The moves in the UK are the latest in a series of measures by governments
around the world to control spending on medicines. Price cuts have been
introduced this year in Italy and Germany, where drugs sales fell 1.8 per
cent and 11 per cent respectively during the first five months of the year.
In the US, Mrs Hillary Clinton is leading a task force preparing health
reforms, due to be released next month.
RPR cut the UK price of its drug, a sleeping pill called Zimovane, from 98p
to 16p per tablet. The medicine generated sales last year of Pounds 10m,
compared with the group's UK prescription medicines turnover of Pounds 90m.
The price cut takes effect from October 1.
The company said the UK department of health was threatening to put the drug
on a blacklist of products which could not be prescribed on the NHS if its
price was not cut. The Department of Health is negotiating with the industry
over blacklists for 10 therapeutic categories.
Dr Ian Hindmarsh, professor of human psycho-pharmacology at the University
of Surrey, said the introduction of blacklists could threaten patients'
lives because old but cheap treatments with serious side effects would be
prescribed in preference to newer, safer, but more expensive drugs.
UK pharmaceuticals stocks fell on the news of RPR's price cut as the market
expected other companies to follow suit.
Glaxo, the company most exposed to the blacklists, closed down 12 1/2 p at
516 1/2 p. SmithKline Beecham, the UK healthcare group, dropped 11p to 438p,
while Wellcome fell 22p to 654p and Zeneca, the recently floated ICI
bioscience business, dropped 6p to 650p.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said RPR's Zimovane
was not a typical example because its price was so far out of line with
other products. But it accepted that other manufacturers would need to cut
prices to avoid the blacklists.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Increase in lending adds to optimism on recovery: French
rate cut helps lift shares to record close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG CONSUMER credit growth and a smaller than expected rise in the prices
of manufactured goods yesterday added to optimism that the UK recovery is
gathering pace without being dogged by inflation.
The good news, together with a trimming of lending rates in France, sent
share prices in London to a record closing high as investors anticipated
renewed economic activity in Europe.
Official UK credit figures pointed to a willingness among consumers to
borrow for this year's early summer sales, indicating they are shedding some
of their post-recession fear of accumulating debt.
The Central Statistical Office said consumers borrowed a net Pounds 213m in
June, the highest seasonally adjusted monthly figure for two years. A
broader measure of credit growth painted a similar picture, with net lending
at Pounds 616m in the second quarter compared with Pounds 299m in the first.
Meanwhile, the prices of manufactured goods leaving factories rose only 0.1
per cent in July compared with June, suggesting that manufacturers are
continuing to absorb the higher cost of imported raw materials and fuel
following the devaluation of sterling in September. Prices were 4.1 per cent
higher than a year ago.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed up 16.6 at a record high of 2,986.4, just off a
new peak reached during trading of 2,986.8. However, the pound, trading
against the background of a stronger D-Mark, lost some of its recent gains
to close down  3/4 of a pfennig at DM2.535. Against the dollar sterling
ended just less than half a cent lower at Dollars 1.4935. In New York it
closed at Dollars 1.49075.
New credit advanced to consumers rose in June to Pounds 4.69bn, from Pounds
4.2bn in May. Nearly two-thirds of the increase reflected higher advances on
credit cards during the month, with most of the remainder due to lending by
finance houses.
Economists counselled against reading too much into one month's figures.
'The June growth in consumer credit reflects the very lumpy profile of the
most recent retail sales figures, which dropped off in May, followed by a
strong June figure to make up,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG
Warburg Securities. 'Still, this is one in the eye for those who thought
that, when the recovery did arrive, consumers would refuse to finance it
with consumer credit,' he added.
June was the ninth consecutive month in which consumers borrowed more than
they paid back.
The credit figures account for only a small part of total private sector
debt as they do not include mortgages. The June lending data take in about
15 per cent of consumer borrowings, while the broader quarterly measure
includes personal bank loans and lending by non-bank credit cards and covers
about 20 per cent.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Kohl warns of two-year delay for monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, admitted last night that strict
insistence on economic convergence between EC member states could delay
creation of a single European currency 'by a year or two,' but he said the
ultimate objective would be unaffected.
The timetable of European economic and monetary union would be discussed at
the special EC summit planned for October, he said in an interview on SAT-1,
a German television station.
A decision on the location of the future European monetary institute - the
forerunner of the planned European central bank - would also be taken at
that summit, which is intended to mark the final ratification of the
Maastricht treaty.
The chancellor staunchly defended the actions of the Bundesbank and the
German government during the recent European currency crisis, saying Germany
had yet again proved its firm commitment to European co-operation. 'The
Bundesbank fulfilled its obligations fully and without any hesitation, fully
supported by the German government,' he said.
'The close and good co-operation between Bundesbank and government proved
its worth, especially in recent days.'
The decision to relax the margins of currency fluctuation within the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was 'not a decision
against Maastricht', he insisted.
However, he agreed that the timetable of economic and monetary union would
have to be discussed by the EC heads of government at the special October
summit.
In a firm reiteration of his commitment to European integ-ration, Mr Kohl
repeated Germany's insistence that the strict economic convergence criteria
 -including limits on government indebtedness, budget deficits, and
inflation - must be maintained.
'We must on no account ease the very strict conditions for national
economies,' he said. 'If this has the consequence . . . that the timetable
now envisaged is delayed by a year or two, then I would simply ask: how does
that change the basic course?'
The decisive thing, he said, was that a united Europe would be built in this
decade, something which had been unimaginable for the previous 90 years of
the century - a Europe in which individual peoples, such as the Germans and
French, would still maintain their national identity, but under a single
'European roof'.
Mr Kohl said recent upheavals in the EMS were 'nothing new'. The problem was
that they were compounded by the international recession, which was a
structural crisis in the world economy. EC member states had also failed to
bring their budget deficits under control.
He expressed surprise that the French government had proposed the temporary
withdrawal of the D-Mark from the ERM during negotiations. He said he told
the French that other EC member states would object, 'and that is what
happened'. There was no German 'plot' against France.
Mr Kohl repeated that Germany was the obvious choice for the site of the
EMI, in spite of the 'reluctance' of one or more member states, in a clear
reference to British opposition. He was 'quite optimistic' that the German
battle to have the institute in Frankfurt would win in the end.

Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, yesterday issued a warning to
Bosnian Serbs that the alliance was prepared to take military action,
including air strikes, if the siege of Sarajevo was not lifted.
However, a four-hour meeting of the Nato Council in Brussels stopped short
of ordering attacks. The organisation insisted further UN consultations and
Nato meetings were needed before action could be taken. Meanwhile,
five-year-old Irma Hadzimuratovic, critically injured in a mortar attack,
was airlifted from Sarajevo to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

FT  10 AUG 93 / InterCity chief to lead franchise bid for ScotRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS GREEN, managing director of British Rail's InterCity subsidiary, is
to become director of ScotRail next year, and intends to lead a bid by its
management for the franchise to run it under the government's privatisation
scheme.
He will set up a shadow franchise company to run ScotRail for up to a year
before the government puts the franchise up for offer. ScotRail operates all
passenger services in Scotland except for InterCity services.
Mr Green, a former managing director of Network SouthEast, has a high
profile among BR executives and should be in a strong position to gain the
backing of financial institutions for a management bid for the franchise. He
will take over from Mr Cyril Bleasdale, who will retire on April 1, and who
had himself hoped to lead a franchise bid.
Mr Green's appointment was among those of 24 directors designate who were
named yesterday by British Rail to run passenger services until they are
franchised.
The Gatwick line, one of the first due for franchising, has been separated
from the Anglia Region, and Mr Rob Mason, currently the franchising director
on the board, will be its director. ScotRail has also been designated one of
the first parts of British Rail to be franchised.
The Department of Transport stressed yesterday that it was committed to
maintaining train services on the west coast main line to Glasgow after
privatisation. This followed a leaked report from a committee of civil
servants and BR officials which raised the possibility of the operators of
the west coast route ceasing to run trains between Preston and Glasgow
because of aggressive competition from the more modern east coast main line.
The document, disclosed by Mr Brian Wilson MP, a Labour transport spokesman,
said that 'in the longer term' competition from the east coast 'will
certainly cast doubt on the economics of the (Euston-Glasgow) sleeper. It
may cause west coast to review whether they should service the market even
with day trains.'
The department said the route would be franchised as a whole and the
franchisee would not be able to pick the parts on which to operate trains.
Mr Green described the leaked document as 'an academic paper on what would
happen if there were unregulated competition'. He thought the franchisee
would have to operate passenger and sleeper services to Glasgow, for which a
subsidy would be paid.
Mr Green said he would definitely be bidding for the ScotRail franchise as
long as he believed there was a viable business. He acknowledged the
management team might face rival bids from other potential franchisees. The
bus company Stagecoach is believed to be interested in bidding.
British Rail said last night that Mr Green wanted to become 'more closely
involved with delivering train service improvements'.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Dark motives seen in Hanoi's power policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors in Vietnam and their domestic counterparts are becoming
increasingly frustrated with the country's power supply.
In Saigon, the former South Vietnamese capital and the focus of foreign
investment in the country, frequent brownouts mean factories and many
offices have invested in expensive generators to keep equipment running.
As the Vietnamese economy continues to grow, the demand for electricity
outstrips the ability of the system to provide it. Officials in the ministry
of energy say demand in the south is at least 20 per cent above capacity,
and the gap is likely to widen over the next few years.
Economic development is concentrated in the south of the country, while most
of the country's electric power is generated in the north. Some foreign
observers suggest this is aimed at keeping the south in thrall to the north.
A dam and hydroelectric plant in northern Vietnam has worsened the
imbalance. The dam, which was started as a Soviet aid project and which will
produce 8.5bn kilowatt hours a year when the final turbine is switched on
later this year, will more than meet demand for power in the north. Yet
Hanoi has plans for a second dam and power plant up river, at a cost of up
to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn).
The government is expected to apply for a project loan from either the World
Bank or the Asian Development Bank. However, as this type of centralised
project has fallen out of favour with the institutions, Hanoi may have to
look elsewhere to raise the money.
The government is already committed to finding at least Dollars 550m for the
construction of a 1,500km transmission cable from northern Vietnam to the
south. It is claimed this will balance supply in the two halves of the
country, and cut the level of power lost in transmission.
However, the line will not be completed for at least another year.
The energy ministry has a long-term development plan to increase generating
capacity to 25bn kilowatt hours by the year 2005, from 10bn kilowatt hours
this year.
According to Mr Nguyen Tien Hai, a director at the ministry, growth levels
can cope with the increased demand in the short term, but after 1996 the gap
between supply and demand could widen rapidly as rural industries and small
businesses are set up.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Romanian coal miners flex their muscles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform
rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike,
pressing the government for higher wages.
But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in. It has
instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its
second week, declared illegal.
The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians appear solidly opposed to
the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the
equivalent of Dollars 290 a month. Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.
Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored
appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each
year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy. The
region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which
together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity,
could also be run using lignite and gas.
The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their
coal out of the market. According to the ministry, if the miners' pay
demands were met, the cost of their coal would double. Even at present
prices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market.
The strike seems motivated by a number of factors. The rank and file have
come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult
conditions in which they live and work.
They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron
Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their
earlier wage increases.
Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has
the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into
charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company
officials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have already
been fired, following earlier investigations.
Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to
divert attention from the investigations.
Mr Cosma, however, appears confident. One of his bargaining tools is the
threat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.
In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, who
appear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'With
miners, anything is possible.'
But he is also making political threats. In recent months, Mr Cosma has
claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including
President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to
consolidate their own power.
Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met. It
remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991
now feel confident enough to ignore him.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Recovery seen emerging for Russia in 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE crisis of the Russian economy will continue well into next year, but
economic recovery can be expected in 1996, according to the government's
latest blueprint for market reform.
This medium-term programme, approved on Friday, also claims to have digested
the lessons of last year, including the need for more social cushioning,
more action against inflation, and selective rather than across-the-board
support for industry.
It lists unchanged strategic aims, such as land reform, and sets out
essential institutional changes, such as the creation of an effective
secondary share market. The latter has failed to materialise so far, despite
the issuing of millions of shares as part of an ambitious mass privatisation
programme.
It also provides some details of a long-promised industrial policy. This
includes, for instance, a need to convert military aircraft factories to the
production of civilian aeroplanes - a process already under way. But, on a
bloated sector such as metallurgy, it remains vague, talking of the need to
reduce pollution and improve its raw materials base.
The programme expects the economy to begin stabilising in the second half of
1994, saying that the completion of mass privatisation by then will have
improved company performance and financial discipline.
It hopes for inflation to fall to 5-7 per cent a month next year, compared
to 19 per cent last month. It sees the budget deficit hovering beneath the
target of 10 per cent of GDP target as early as last year. By the end of
1995 it expects the equivalent of 35 per cent of gross domestic product to
be in state hands. It also expects an unspecified growth in living standards
by then.
In 1996, along with a halt in the slide of Russian energy production, and
stabilisation of agricultural output, it predicts the beginnings of a
resumption of economic growth.
Finalised after last month's botched monetary reform, the report says,
'there are no serious reasons to predict catastophe unless we ourselves
bring them into being'.
The European Commission announced at the weekend a temporary solution to a
row with Russia over aluminium imports, by announcing it would restrict
imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States to 60,000 tonnes between
now and November.
This quota would include unsold stocks on the London Metals Exchange. The
Commission, under pressure from EC producers to limit imports which have hit
prices, said an investigation had found unfair damage had been caused to EC
producers.

FT  09 AUG 93 / How not to give a moral lead: Pope John Paul II's draft
encyclical allows no role for the individual conscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since it still claims a universal mission, there is no presumption in a
non-Catholic writing about the affairs of the Roman Catholic Church.
Indeed, for a lay Anglican, I have got to know recent Popes unusually well.
Not that I have ever met one. But it was once my lot to read the tomes of
papal encyclicals issued over the past century, and they cast a cruel light
on Rome's renewed crusade against birth control and internal dissent.
The toil was not, alas, a course of instruction on the meaning and sanctity
of life. It was an attempt to get to grips with the mercurial concept of
subsidiarity, an idea made flesh in successive encyclicals since Leo XIII's
Rerum Novarum (1891), including Paul VI's controversial Humanae Vitae
(1968).
Subsidiarity, remember, was a cornerstone of the Maastricht treaty. As the
rest of the temple crashes to the ground, it still stands as Jacques
Delors's Vatican-inspired solution to the challenge of building a European
state without des-troying its peoples' way of life.
The ideas behind subsidiarity are simple. Leave unto God what is God's, and
within Caesar's realm, pass power down as far as possible, preferably to
local communities and families, the building blocks of society.
The problem, of course, is to decide what rightly belongs to the Almighty
and what to Caesar; and then to find a formula for determining who should
decide those matters that are left to the state.
The nearest the Vatican has come to tackling that is Quadragesimo Anno, Pius
XI's riposte to Mussolini's ambitions to nationalise church activity.
Governments, warned Pius, would 'carry out with greater freedom, power and
success the tasks belonging to them alone' if they left matters of lesser
importance 'to smaller groups'. Those in charge should know when to desist,
and ought to be solicitous of the views and circumstances of 'lower
societies'.
Now, as anyone who has ever watched or participated in the political game
ought to know, this is pie in the sky. Without formal checks and balances,
achieved through blood or sweat (and usually both), virtually no society in
history has for any long period secured rulers obedient to such precepts.
Which brings us straight to Veritatis Splendor, the draft encyclical
awaiting the present Pope's signature. For the most striking thing about the
modern papacy - forget Galileo - is its contempt for its own precepts.
Consider Rome's attitude to the 'lower societies' in its own communion. Back
at the first Vatican Council of 1870, when the principle of papal
infallibility was codified, the Church as a whole was pronounced infallible,
and the Pope was enjoined to consult the brethren before exerting authority.
What process of consultation has there ever been on the question of birth
control? Before Humanae Vitae a papal commission was established to
investigate and solicit views on the issue. A majority of the commission
apparently recommended a relaxation of Catholic teaching on the issue, but
Paul VI insisted on a blanket ban on 'any action which either before, or at
the moment of, or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to
prevent procreation'.
This time round, there has not even been a commission. There have been
'consultations' with bishops' conferences and interested parties - but if
the published drafts of Veritatis Splendor are remotely accurate, the Church
in western Europe and North America was given the deaf ear.
Anyway, why does John Paul II feel it necessary to dictate to the 'lower
societies' on the issue at all? If subsidiarity means anything within the
Church, then surely on matters not critical to faith the Pope should refrain
from imposing his will and allow the Church on the ground to apply its own
Christian conscience to the moral and social problems besetting its members.
John Paul's response, according to the published draft, is highly
convoluted, but it seems to run like this. The Church's moral teachings
'while they are to be distinguished from the assent to faith, nevertheless
enlarge it'. The 'natural law' from which they are drawn is 'universally
valid' and only the Pope is capable of expounding its 'binding nature'. And
once expounded, the faithful have no choice but to obey since obedience to
the natural law is 'necessary for salvation' and 'dissent stands in
opposition to the unity of the Church'.
In other words, there is no role for individuals and 'lower societies' to
apply their conscience to any moral question once the Pope has expounded the
natural law - law which, by its nature, is not written down definitively
anywhere save in past papal pronouncements, themselves reflecting the
conscience of Christians in previous generations applied to their
circumstances.
So much for subsidiarity. The net effect in the west, of course, will be
further to undermine Catholic teaching, and to leave in a moral quagmire
Catholics who believe there is any role for individual conscience.
The tragedy is the damage John Paul II will do to the very notion of moral
and spiritual leadership. For at last, the liberal conceit that we always
know what is best for us is biting the dust. But as a community in search of
a credible moral lead, where do we look? Certainly not to a papacy which
rejects outright Newman's profound wisdom that 'conscience is the first of
all the vicars of Christ'.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Monday Interview: Music to Grumpy's ears - Sumner Redstone,
owner of Viacom and MTV, talks to Raymond Snoddy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sumner Redstone's five grandchildren always call him Grumpy. He picked the
nickname himself because, although he is 70 and looks like a wise and kindly
old grandfather, he did not want to sound like one.
How Redstone gets on with his grandchildren is of more than passing interest
outside his family because his business is built around communicating with
young people. The grandchildren also act as critics for some of the products
he offers in the US and, increasingly, the world.
Redstone owns and runs Viacom, the fast-expanding media group which controls
television channels including MTV, the international purveyor of pop and
video culture, and Nickelodeon, the successful US children's channel which
will be launched in the UK next month as part of British Sky Broadcasting's
new subscription package of 14 channels.
This business has given Redstone personal wealth estimated at more than
Dollars 3bn, the majority accrued over the past few years when most men
would already have retired. Until he was 64, and before he bought Viacom in
1987, Sumner Redstone was worth merely a few hundred million dollars.
'Viacom has been the most exciting, fun experience of my life. I work with
everyone. I'm involved with everyone,' says Redstone, who could be a
surrogate grandfather for many of his staff, whose average age is 27.
Viacom's interests range from cable television systems in west and mid-west
America to five television stations and 14 radio stations. The programme
channels are at the heart of the business: MTV is available in more than
200m homes, including in Europe and Asia, and MTV Latin America in Spanish
will be launched on October 1.
There is also VH-1, a music channel for 25- to 49-year-olds, and Nick At
Nite, general entertainment for young adults, which takes over from
Nickelodeon in the evening - both are coming to the UK next year as part of
the Sky package. In addition, Viacom owns two subscription film channels and
syndication rights to comedies such as The Crosby Show and Roseanne.
'This is essentially a software-driven company,' says Redstone. 'Our mission
is to drive (the programmes) to every place in the world and to every new
application.'
His goal is not solely to make as much money as possible. An old-fashioned
Boston liberal, he says he is aware of the responsibilities of being
involved in the creation of an international youth culture.
Redstone encourages certain limits on what is permissible. For example, MTV
rejected Madonna's latest, erotic pop videos on grounds of taste, in the
face of considerable criticism about censorship as well as potential
financial loss.
The channel may still be 85 per cent music, but it is also starting to do
other things. For instance, MTV covered the US presidential campaign and
interviewed Bill Clinton on his way to the White House. At the MTV Inaugural
Ball, President Clinton acknowledged that MTV had 'a lot to do with his
victory' by persuading hundreds of thousands of new voters to register.
The programme Fifteen on Nickelodeon, aimed at the high-school audience in
the US, deals with difficult issues such as drugs and sex. As part of
Nickelodeon's Aids coverage, a condom was shown in a programme for young
children. 'I was crying. I literally was crying as I watched that programme.
I felt so proud. That would never have appeared on public broadcasting,'
says Redstone.
Economics and idealism, Redstone insists, go together. He has a vision of an
international children's channel, created with local partners - 'a chance of
an international lobby for the kind of world we want to live in'. But he
talks about money with equal fluency and enthusiasm.
The Viacom chairman is excited that, in the wake of his leveraged Dollars
3.4bn purchase of the company, its average rate of bank borrowing has fallen
substantially. He also points out Viacom's senior debt was upgraded last
year by Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, to investment grade,
and this year Dollars 100m will go to the bottom line from interest savings,
owing to the reduction in debt levels.
Last year Viacom had net earnings of Dollars 49m, compared with a net loss
of Dollars 50m the previous year, boosted by strong performances by MTV
networks and from the company's cable television division. Last month, it
reported operating profits of Dollars 107m for the second quarter, an
increase of 11 per cent over the same period last year.
Redstone's present media success is a long way from the start of his life,
as a justice department lawyer. Lawyers, he believes, are 'the worst
dissipators of human and economic resources I know'.
*something in here (HP) *
He moved across to business and, with his father, Michael, helped to develop
drive-in cinemas in the 1950s, and later became a pioneer of multi-screen
cinemas. He still owns National Amusements, which has more than 800 screens
in the US and the UK, owns the name Multiplex, and is president of the
Theatre Owners trade organisation.
In 1979, Redstone's life was settled and seemingly secure. All that changed
one night in a Boston hotel fire.
'It's impossible to explain how bad it was. I was covered in flames,' he
says. He managed to climb out of his third-floor window and hang on to the
window ledge by his fingertips until help arrived.
At first he was not expected to survive. Then he was told he would not be
able to walk. But after 60 hours of skin grafts and a lot of determination,
Redstone is now a regular tennis player again.
'I have no nightmares about it. What makes me feel very happy is that all of
this at Viacom came after the fire so I was able to begin a whole new life,'
he says.
The new business career began almost by accident, when he started taking
stock positions in Hollywood companies ranging from Columbia to MGM Home
Entertainment. His knowledge of how their products - the movies - were
faring at the box office gave him an edge.
Redstone bought a few thousand shares in Viacom in 1985 in the hope of
selling them at a profit. He started asking questions about Viacom, and the
answers made him consider a more serious role in the company. 'It was the
flip side of motion picture exhibition,' he says. Cinema exhibition was a
mature business, but Viacom was in the vanguard of its most dangerous rival
 -home entertainment.
In his 60s, Redstone mounted his first big hostile takeover - in competition
with a Viacom management buy-out team. 'We had to B-O-R-R-O-W (spelling it
out for emphasis) Dollars 500m in connection with this company. At National
Amusements if we borrowed Dollars 10m or Dollars 15m, that was a major
event.'
He lured away the highly regarded Frank Biondi - former head of the Home Box
Office pay TV movie channel and chairman of the Coca-Cola Television
production company - in a multi-million dollar deal to run Viacom.
One of the strengths of the Redstone-Biondi team is in assessing the new
opportunities technology is creating for programme distribution, and the
growing links between telephone and cable companies.
Viacom recently linked up with American Telephone and Telegraph to test
everything from video-on-demand television services and multi-player games
to home shopping at the Viacom cable system in Castro Valley, California.
All the new technical opportunities could provide new outlets for Viacom
programmes. Referring to his cinema experience, Redstone argues: 'If the
motion picture worked, the theatres worked. It's the same with the
(television) programmes.'
He has no intention of easing up, and he says another big acquisition,
perhaps of a Hollywood studio, has not been ruled out.
He is still having difficulty coming to terms with one aspect of Viacom  -
MTV music: 'It's not exactly my demographic. I enjoy the dancing, the
excitement, the sensuality, but I still like Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw,
Tommy Dorsey.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / VW versus the old school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<TEXT>
We can let our industrial structure collapse like the English did, and then
the Japanese will come here and have us build cars in Germany from mostly
prefabricated parts. For that you need a couple of young people, and they
will be more than glad to have any kind of a job,' says Mr Ferdinand Piech.
The Volkswagen chairman may not be much of a diplomat, but as a visionary he
is worth a hearing. It is readily acknowledged that much of German industry
is overweight, overmanned and overdue for an overhaul.
But is Mr Piech overdoing things? His colleagues in industry goggled
enviously last March when he recruited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
General Motors' star procurement chief, and seven of Mr Lopez's parts-buying
'warriors'. They were shocked when GM was forced to use the courts to stop
his attempt to lure another 40 from the buying department at Adam Opel, the
GM German subsidiary.
And they were struck dumb by what followed. GM's espionage charges were
stunning in themselves, and Mr Piech's more recent nationalistic war
declarations and charges that GM had conspired to pervert the course of
justice deeply disturbed the political and industrial establishment.
But the smoke and noise from these fronts have tended to obscure another
conflict at ground level, where Mr Lopez's warriors are bludgeoning price
cuts out of VW suppliers. Late last week, the VDMA engineering and plant
makers' association begged for mercy and a return to 'civilised' ways of
doing business.
Large industrial customers - especially the motor industry - were using
'extortion' and 'extreme aggression', it said. Parts buyers demanded to be
given foundry moulds and construction drawings, saying continuity of supply
had to be ensured should the suppliers go bust.
Such bully-boy tactics were previously unknown in the co-operative,
consensus-oriented world of German commerce.
Still, no one - least of all General Motors - can deny the efficacy of the
Lopez slimming cure. It made Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, into the
most profitable carmaker in Europe when he was based there in the 1980s. And
last week the US parent surprised the world with a Dollars 889m
second-quarter net profit compared with a Dollars 703m loss a year earlier.
Most striking of all was the fall in the deficit in the core north American
business, from Dollars 761m to Dollars 95m - all attributed to cost-savings.
Mr Lopez and his warriors had been at work in Detroit for just 10 months
when they left in March.
Success at Opel, however, came when the German economy was expanding. And
results in the US were achieved in a no-holds-barred free market that is far
more flexible, far more used to implementing harsh hire-and-fire policies,
than Germany's vaunted 'social economy'.
It is clear from the German engineering association's claims that other
companies are now following the Lopez example - put brutally, kicking the
man on the next rung down the ladder. Instead of calm consensus, there is a
growing atmosphere of every man for himself.
Bosch, however, the country's mightiest car parts supplier and a company of
the old, more courteous school, believes it can stand above the fray. It
says it will follow its own cost-reduction plans at its own pace, and refuse
to bow to unreasonable demands.
The company's executives suggest privately that an organised front among
lesser companies could deny VW its clamour for pound after pound of flesh.
Is a new consensus - the rest against VW - possible?
The absence of public backing for VW's policies and tactics from industry or
the political establishment - although both are anxious for a lasting cure
to Germany's economic ills - suggests VW is moving out on a limb.
An extraordinary meeting of the company's supervisory board, called
unexpectedly on Friday, resulted in an extraordinary display of confidence
in the effectiveness and honesty of VW's dream team. But the fact that it
was called at all, when most of Germany was away on holiday, demonstrated
mounting pressure.
Even if Mr Piech pulls off his ambition of returning VW to break-even this
year and profit thereafter, it is likely to be partly at the expense of the
components industry.
All native German automotive companies' basic strategies depend on increased
purchasing of parts from abroad, and on moving vehicle production closer to
markets and into lower-cost production zones outside Germany.
Most, Volkswagen included, see this as the best long-term solution to their
difficulties. But VW, the country's biggest carmaker and by definition its
biggest components user, by aggressively pursuing its own immediate aims,
could damage the close-knit network of component suppliers and the
collaborative relationship between German carmakers.
In the longer term this could put at risk the home base, on which the whole
industry relies to sustain its long-term metamorphosis.
Mr Piech explains his ardour with claims that the German industry has only
two years - the time before Japan's current voluntary quotas expire - to
match up to its arch-competitors' cost structures. But even he accepts he
cannot come within striking distance in less than three years.
Mr Piech is making a bold gamble. That his more traditionally minded,
long-termist colleagues at Mercedes-Benz, BMW and elsewhere have not thrown
their weight behind him suggests they still need to be persuaded he is on to
a winner. The legal threats confronting Mr Lopez, on whom the VW chairman
has staked his reputation, do not improve his chances of success.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Pressure still on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH NO sign of monetary easing in continental Europe, analysts belive this
week could see a renewed bout of pressure on currencies such as the franc,
the peseta and the Danish krone.
Towards the end of last week dealers reported that informal attempts by
European exchange rate mechanism members to shadow their old bands were
failing as all bar the D-mark lost value.
'If European countries do not cut rates it seems that the foreign exchange
markets are going to force depreciation upon them,' said Mr Michael Burke,
economist at Citibank in London.
The reluctance of the French authorities to cut interest rates helped the
franc recoup some of its lost ground last week, but dealers believe the
buoyancy will be short lived.
They suspect that the French, Danes, and Belgians are attempting to delay
rate cuts until August 26, when the Bundesbank meets again after its summer
break. By then monetary authorities may have a better idea of whether
another German rate cut is imminent, facilitating a round of cuts elsewhere
in Europe.
The dollar could rise on the back of retail sales data next week, although
the median forecast among analysts is for only a modest increase in July
sales. But even the modest strength of the US recovery looks sturdier than
any growth likely to be seen in continental Europe this year, and the dollar
stands to benefit.
Sterling will probably continue to waver this week as expectations for
another rate cut stand in the way of a strong advance. It may also suffer
from weak domestic data. Economists expect manufacturing figures on Thursday
to show that output fell in June, partly as a bounce back from strong May
figures but also a reflection of slowing exports to Europe.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Directors' stock options packages under
scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of otherwise conservative corporate boards of directors have
blundered into the derivatives arena, writing options on millions of dollars
of the corporation's own stock. Then, like the world's worst traders, the
directors fail to account for the options liability on the corporate balance
sheet or take any steps to hedge the options exposure.
Shareholders, in the language of options traders, are left naked. In the
trading room of an investment bank, this behaviour would be viewed as wildly
speculative and irresponsible. In the corporate arena, it is an accepted,
and expanding, practice.
Corporations, seeking to design executive compensation plans with built-in
performance motivations, routinely grant generous stock options packages.
When the options are exercised, new shares are issued, diluting shareholder
equity.
Mr Carl Levin, a US Democratic senator from Michigan, calls it 'stealth
compensation'. Since US accounting rules don't require corporations to
charge the options liability to earnings, many directors view options as a
'free' way to boost compensation packages.
Options compensation proliferated during the 1980s. Many of those perks had
eight to 10-year durations, and when US income tax laws changed in 1992,
some high-profile executives grabbed headlines with options exercises.
Mr Michael Eisner of Disney, for one, took several hundred million dollars
in gains from options exercises in December. The company issued stock to
meet his call. The late Mr Steven Ross of Time-Warner was given a lucrative
option on 7.2m shares of the company's stock in 1990. Analysts say they are
still exercisable by Mr Ross's estate, and are now valued at more than
Dollars 50m.
Smaller companies, particularly high-technology firms, may have a
surprisingly large percentage of stock exposed to options compensation.
Although determining options exposure from a company's annual report is
difficult, an estimated 17 per cent of Compaq computer, for example, is tied
up in options. Typically, a corporate's options exposure is far smaller, but
cannot be viewed, as it often is by corporate boards, as insignificant.
Mr Graef Crystal, Emeritus Professor at the University of Southern
California at Berkely, and an options benefits consultant, says: 'The danger
of this is that any commodity that is undervalued is usually over-consumed.
The biggest barrier to proper accounting for executive options, and for
proper hedging, is the perception that options have no value.'
The Federal Accounting Standards Board is on the verge of requiring
companies to reduce their reported earnings by the value of their stock
options. This, many analysts fear, would remove a valuable executive
incentive tool. Options traders and institutional investors, however,
believe the issue is not accounting rules, but proper management of the
options position.
Equity options specialists at Swiss Bank Corp and at Salomon Brothers say
that shareholder liability to executive options could be easily managed by
an offsetting call purchase. In other words, if Disney wished to grant an
executive the right to buy 1m shares at Dollars 37 each any time during the
next five years, Disney, at the same time, would buy calls on its own stock
from a market-making dealer for the same quantity, duration, and strike
price.
The offsetting calls would limit shareholder exposure to the executive's
bonus package to the cost of the options premium, should Disney's stock
price rise. Dealers estimate the cost of the offsetting option, given the
five-year life, would amount to about 25 per cent of the share price. The
dealer-issued calls, if exercised, are non-taxable to the corporation,
reducing costs.
'Corporations have a hard time with valuing their own options, but we are
willing to make a market for them anytime,' one options trader notes.
'An executive looking after his own interest will be unwilling to spend
millions up-front (for a call premium) to protect shareholders from a
liability that may be five or 10 years down the line, even if the options
exposure could run into hundreds of millions of dollars.'
