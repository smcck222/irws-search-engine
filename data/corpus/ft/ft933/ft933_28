FT  09 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Hopes of interest rate cuts fuel
European revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate fever swept through the European bond markets last week with
the birth of a brave new world of floating exchange rates.
The decision by European Community finance ministers, taken early on August
2, to move from a fairly rigid European exchange rate mechanism based on
narrow fluctuation bands to one where the fluctuation bands of 15 per cent
are so wide as to be irrelevant, triggered a strong rally in European bonds.
This was prompted on the view that European governments would be free to
kick-start their recession-hit economies by swiftly cutting domestic
interest rates.
In fact, few cut rates once the shackles were removed, and those who did
were far from bold. The Bundesbank surprised the markets with a 15 basis
point cut in the fixed rate for 14-day repos, to 6.80 per cent, and an
easing in the 28-day repo rate, to 6.70 per cent - which put the latter
below the discount rate of 6.75 per cent.
Spain cut its benchmark interest rate by half a point, to 10.5 per cent,
while Sweden snipped 25 basis points off its marginal lending rate, to 8.25
per cent. However, there is ample scope for European interest rates to fall
further, and the bond markets have soared in response.
Even the Ecu bond market - which is so sensitive to shifts in sentiment
regarding the future of Europe - saw a sudden renewal of interest last week.
However, while its short-term prospects make it attractive to some
investors, there is still a large question mark over its longer-term
attractions.
The Ecu bond market took off last week mainly because investors realised the
bonds were too cheap, while providing a relatively simple means of
benefiting from the potential for interest rate cuts across Europe.
'It's a cost-effective way of gaining exposure to European markets - people
buy it as a way of saving dealing costs,' says Mr Michael Burke, economist
at Citibank.
The actual yield on Ecu bonds was higher than the theoretical yield curve
(calculated according to the bond yields of the Ecu's component currencies),
which meant the bonds were cheap relative to the theoretical value.
However, last week's rally in the Ecu bond market pushed actual yields below
theoretical yields. For example, the actual yield on the 8 per cent, 10-year
French Ecu bond was 6.99 per cent on Friday, or 7 basis points below its
theoretical yield, while three-month UK Ecu treasury bills had an actual
yield of 7.9 per cent, compared with a theoretical yield of 7.95 per cent.
'The actual yield could be as much as 20 to 30 basis points lower than the
theoretical yield, and the bonds would still represent good value because of
the transaction cost-saving,' says Mr Burke.
Mr Bob Tyley, head of bond analysis at Paribas Capital Markets, points out
that for investors based outside Europe, the move from semi-fixed to
floating exchange rates means there is more uncertainty over which currency
will do what. As a result, the basket nature of the Ecu becomes more
important, given that the Ecu can be used as a substitute means of investing
in Europe, he says.
Yet for all the short-term euphoria springing from the move to wider
fluctuation bands in the ERM, there is still considerable concern over the
future of the Ecu.
'The whole prospect of European monetary union is, if not dead, at least on
its death-bed, so it is highly unlikely that the Ecu bond market will enjoy
the same attractions as it did before the first Danish referendum on the
Maastricht treaty,' says Mr Burke.
If there are grave doubts over whether the Ecu will become the single
currency for Europe, investors and issuers may well wonder why they should
bother with a market which does not have much of a future and which could
suffer from illiquidity - even if Mr John Major does try to relaunch the
plan for a hard Ecu.
Ecu bond issuance has certainly dried up since the Danes dealt a blow to
hopes of European economic and monetary union last summer. Ecu bond
specialists, meanwhile, admit it is hard to see why issuers should tap this
market at the moment. In the past, some issues have been swap-driven, but
dealers say there are few favourable swap opportunities in Ecu.
So if there is to be a fresh drive to revive the Ecu bond market, it may
well have to be politically motivated. In the past, France was one of the
keenest advocates of Ecu bond issuance, and had undertaken to conduct about
15 per cent of its funding in Ecu. However, given that French government
bond yields are lower than Ecu bond yields, there is no financial incentive
for the French to issue Ecu-denominated debt, although those with a keen
interest in the Ecu market no doubt will be watching closely to see just how
committed the Ecu's supporters prove to be.

FT  09 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: No sign of let-up in rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE in the gilt market shows little sign of running out of steam. As
investors continued to buy the securities on hopes of lower interest rates
across Europe, 25-year dated gilts ended the week at their best levels for
25 years.
The 0.25 percentage point fall in yields for longer-dated securities
illustrated the perception in financial markets that, after the remodelling
of the European exchange rate mechanism, there will be plenty of room for UK
borrowing rates to ease by the end of the year.
While the September long gilt future was on Friday night quoted at 111 15/32
, close to a record, London share prices ended the week at a new high. The
FT-SE 100 index closed up 26.4 points on the day, at 2,969.8, topping the
previous record close of 2,957.3.
The unusual event of the two markets being close to a peak at the same time
underlines the belief that inflationary pressures are becoming less of a
problem. According to this thinking, the UK government might be able to
bring down base rates from 6 per cent, without worrying that extra demand
would feed into rising prices for goods and services.
Behind the events of the past week, in which medium-dated gilts have climbed
nearly 2 points, is the feeling that the new 15 per cent bands in the ERM
will allow large cuts in interest rates across continental Europe.
Government bonds across Europe have risen as a result, with the biggest
gainers being gilts and Spanish and Italian securities.
Non-UK institutions were big buyers of gilts last week. This was on the view
that sterling was likely to gain in the short run from not being a member of
the mechanism.
The lack of action by continental European governments in cutting interest
rates last week was seen as only temporary. It was thought countries such as
France, Denmark and Belgium will want to pause for breath before easing
monetary conditions and risking a further fall in their currencies.
With 10-year gilt yields finishing the week at around 7.1 per cent, and
25-year yields at 7.6 per cent, the market was barely disturbed by news of a
Pounds 1.5bn gilt issue from the Bank of England. The gilts go on sale from
today and comprise Pounds 1bn of partly-paid 8.5 per cent Treasury loan
stock due 2007 at a price of 108.50 per cent; Pounds 100m of 7.75 per cent
Treasury loan stock due 2012 to 2015; Pounds 200m of 2.5 per cent
index-linked Treasury stock due 2013; and Pounds 200m of 2.5 per cent
index-linked Treasury stock maturing 2024.
Some market participants have been depressed by worries about the large
issues of gilts to finance the expected Pounds 50bn government deficit this
financial year. However, Mr Michael Rosenberg, head of international
fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch says: 'Concerns about budget deficits
are unlikely to have much of an effect on bond markets while inflation
trends are thought to be sound.'
This week a raft of data will shed more light on the degree of demand in the
UK economy and consequent inflationary pressures. Figures today will
indicate how much new credit consumers took on in June, with the market
believing this will be about Pounds 170m.
Concerns about the strength of the upturn are reflected in forecasts for
manufacturing output, with the City expecting a month-on-month fall of 0.6
per cent in June. However, this would partly reflect a strong May figure,
when output rose 1.8 per cent on the month.
The manufacturing figures will be released on Thursday, as will labour
market data for June and July.

FT  09 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Budget victory provides comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE Clinton Administration heaved a huge sigh of relief as the budget
deficit package squeaked through the Senate on Friday night, the nation's
bond markets probably shared the sentiment. It is not as if anyone is
starry-eyed about the impact of the Clinton proposals. However, on balance,
better that this package is implemented than more weeks of uncertainty.
Despite the eventual narrowness of the president's victory in Washington,
bond traders had been edging towards the assumption that the package would
pass all week.
Confidence began to set in on Tuesday, with the result that the benchmark
30-year Treasury bond rose by over half a point, pushing its yield down to
6.51 per cent. That represented the lowest closing level since the Treasury
began regular auctions of the 30-year bond 16 years ago.
Even then, however, convictions were quickly unsettled, and some of
Tuesday's early euphoria died away in the late afternoon. For the next three
days, the market fluctuated apprehensively, although by Friday evening most
market participants said that passage of the bill was largely factored into
bond price levels.
The long bond itself ended the week with a yield of 6.53 per cent, down from
the previous Friday's 6.56 per cent. Despite economists' debate over the
value of the Clinton proposals, the package is generally seen as bullish for
bond prices. In theory, at least, higher taxes should slow the economy,
while any check on the deficit implies less government borrowing, making
existing bonds more valuable.
However, while the media spotlight was fixed on Capitol Hill last week, bond
traders were equally interested in the release of a string of economic
statistics.
The most important data came on Friday, in the form of the July jobs report,
although the figures contained few surprises. Broadly speaking, the report
reinforced the impression of an economy in modest, but steady, expansion.
Payroll employment increased 162,000, while the unemployment rate slipped
from 7 to 6.8 per cent. This was close to market expectations, and
commentators were quick to note that the fall in the unemployment rate was
helped by a decrease in the size of the labour force last month.
Statistics released earlier in the week presented an equally comforting
picture. Manufacturers' new orders rose 2.6 per cent last month, but much of
this was transportation-related and the underlying increase in the
manufacturing sector was modest. Similarly, the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' report for July remained below the critical 50 level -
rising only slightly from 48.3 in June to 49.5 last month. (Readings above
50 suggest that the manufacturing economy is expanding).
Small wonder, then, that few economists are really concerned about the
impending price data, which will be unveiled this week.
Thursday will see the release of the July Producer Price Index. Most pundits
are talking of a 0.2 per cent increase in the 'core' rate, which excludes
food and energy costs. On Friday, the expectation is for a similar rise in
the 'core' Consumer Price Index, which would match the average monthly
advance notched up over the March-June period. If those predictions prove
correct - and coupled with last week's unalarming jobs numbers - almost
everyone concurs that the Fed's monetary policy will simply stand on hold.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Bowthorpe seeks Dollars 75m
through US placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE, the international electronic and electrical components group,
plans to raise Dollars 75m from US institutions with a private placement of
10-year fixed-rate bonds.
Mr Colin McCarthy, finance director, said he felt 'the timing was right to
borrow US dollars long term', given that US interest rates were at their
lowest levels in nearly two decades. The company expects to borrow funds at
below 7 per cent.
'We have major investments in the US so we need dollars,' Mr McCarthy said,
pointing out that proceeds of the bond issue would be kept in dollars.
Bowthorpe has a five-year Pounds 100m borrowing facility - known as a
multi-option facility, or MOF - which is approaching its maturity date and
which allowed the company to borrow at 15 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor). The US private placement of bonds is
intended to replace this MOF financing, of which Pounds 60m was committed.
UK companies have been flocking to the US private placement market in recent
months, attracted by the availability of long-term funding at relatively
favourable terms.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Italian Bonds: Activity brings great expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S bond dealers will be wondering whether the week ahead will live up
to that just passed, when investors ploughed into Italian paper to lock into
relatively high yields before expected interest rate cuts.
The market had not been so active for months, with prices and volumes for
10-year futures rising particularly fast. Futures prices jumped by about L5
on the week to close at about L109 on Friday. Just 11 months ago, when
currencies were in turmoil and confidence in Italy was fading, futures
prices were hovering around L90.
The reasons for investors' new interest is reflected in figures from JP
Morgan showing that Italy was Europe's best-performing government bond
market in July, with a return of 2.77 per cent in local currency terms -
more than double the European average of 1.33 per cent.
'Last week started with euphoria and ended little less exciting. We expect
some consolidation now, but confidence in Italian bonds has clearly been
re-established,' said one trader at Caboto in Milan.
The market has regained much of the support lost after the lira left the
exchange rate mechanism, and the pace of the political corruption scandal
accelerated last year. After having ditched lira paper on the back of
political uncertainty and currency risk, foreign investors are back in
force.
Ironically, the reasons for buying lira bonds are virtually identical to
those before the flotation. Then, as now, lira issues offered a substantial
spread advantage over comparable German or French paper, while the outlook
for inflation looked encouraging. With interest rates across Europe expected
to fall, investors wanted to guarantee their returns.
The difference now is that the lira is outside the ERM. But with the
mechanism in tatters, and participating currencies observing
15-percentage-point fluctuation bands, that is no longer so relevant. For
today's investors, the markets set to gain most from the less strict ERM
standards are those with higher yields, such as Italy, where interest rates
have furthest to fall.
'The political picture is also looking up,' says Mr Sergio Siotto, of
Albertini in Milan. 'Last week saw approval for electoral reform, opening
the way to new elections, and the Senate passed the government's broad
1994-1996 budget plans.' The political news gave the markets an additional
fillip, pushing prices for 10-year futures to almost L110 on Wednesday.
Most dealers expect a period of stability now. Few expect the Bank of Italy
to cut rates before its European counterparts. And any temptation to act
independently would only follow further steps on tackling the budget
deficit, meaning that it will probably have to wait until parliament returns
from its summer recess.
Some dealers warn against over-enthusiasm, however. 'The timing of new
elections and privatisations are still up in the air,' says one London-based
dealer. 'Italy still has many obstacles to overcome.'
'The danger is the market has moved too quickly. Prices are looking very
toppy now,' says a Milan colleague. 'Central banks will want to restore
their reserves, so it will be a while before interest rates fall any
further.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Taiwan's future lies a strait
away - Business with China is under new pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Winston Yang, like his father, billionaire Formosa Plastics chairman, YC
Wang, has strong views about the need for Taiwanese business to spread its
wings to the mainland. 'We will have to go to China. In my opinion our
future direction is mainland China. We have to be close to our customers,'
says Mr Wang, 42, who heads Nan Ya Plastics Corporation, the biggest company
in the Formosa Plastics group, Taiwan's biggest conglomerate.
His views are typical of those held by Taiwanese business, which is growing
impatient at the brakes placed by the nervous authorities on commercial
links with the mainland. These restrictions include a block on bank lending
for projects in China, restraint on raising money on the equity markets for
investment across the Taiwan strait and a requirement that permission be
sought for certain categories of investment.
Taiwan's rulers worry that if all restrictions are lifted, including
permission for direct trade and travel, a business exodus would accelerate,
draining investment away from Taiwan itself and jeopardising the island's
future prosperity and weakening it politically.
Mr Wang Jr, however, is adamant that if business is to continue to expand,
it must relocate some of its operations to its largest market. This is
partly, he says, because the business environment in Taiwan itself is
becoming less convivial as the costs of land and labour rise steeply.
Environmental groups are also increasingly assertive, holding up key
projects like a nuclear power plant and Formosa Plastics' own Dollars 7.6bn
plans to build a sixth naptha cracking plant and associated petrochemical
facilities.
'Taiwan industry is at a crossroads,' says Mr Wang. 'Problems include lack
of investment incentives, not to mention the highest cost of industrial land
in the world today, even higher than Japan.'
Citing pressure from what he described as a 'local mafia', Mr Wang said
Formosa Plastics' naptha plant had been held up for six years while argument
raged about environmental and other aspects of the project.
While big business in Taiwan considers its strategy across the Taiwan strait
and pressures the government to ease restrictions, smaller enterprises have
wasted little time in seizing the opportunity. By the end of 1992, Taiwanese
businessmen had committed some Dollars 8.5bn in investment, and actual
direct utilised investment had reached Dollars 1.9bn. Some 8,000 to 10,000
projects had been established with Taiwanese involvement, the vast bulk of
them small and medium-size enterprises. Average investment totalled about
Dollars 1m.
Mr Wang is planning a substantial investment in southern China, perhaps in
the order of Dollars 200m, in a plant to produce a range of Nan Ya Plastics'
staple items, including PVC and polyester products for use in manufacturing
consumer goods such as handbags, shoes and apparel.
'Our customers are asking Nan Ya to set up factories in China,' said Mr
Wang. 'There is a definite economic advantage for us to invest in the
mainland. It would cut delivery times for our products, bearing in mind that
the fashion business changes very quickly. If there is a market, you must go
the market,' he adds.
Nan Ya is being drawn inexorably towards investment in the mainland by the
spectacular increase in its China business. Six years ago it was exporting
10 per cent of its products across the Taiwan strait. Now, exports to China
have reached 60 per cent of its total production.
Among Mr Wang's chief complaints is the additional cost of shipping to China
through Hong Kong to satisfy the continued ban on direct trade with China.
He estimates that for each standard 17-tonne 20 ft container, additional
shipping and handling charges amount to about Dollars 700. Nan Ya ships
about 50,000 tonnes of product to China annually.
Mr Wang sees his company's future and the manufacturing future for Taiwan
itself in the higher value-added items, while labour-intensive industries
move across the Taiwan strait. The arithmetic here would seem compelling.
Wages in Taiwan for the average skilled worker amount to between Dollars
1,500 and Dollars 2,000 per month, compared with Dollars 40 per month on the
mainland.
In line with these imperatives, Formosa Plastics, in its latest annual
report, made no secret of its belief that the mainland offered the best
prospects for growth. Interestingly, the company chairman Y. C. Wang used
the report to press the case politically for a lessening of restrictions on
investment in the mainland.
His remarks make interesting reading, especially in light of what is seen as
the enormous potential economic strength of greater China, including Taiwan,
Hong Kong and the mainland itself.
Arguing for investing in China rather than other economies in south-east
Asia, Mr Yang wrote: 'The first advantage for investment in mainland China
is its deep-rooted nationalism system. Contained in nationalism is very
little worry of misappropriation of the incoming investor's management
technologies.
'The second is the historical anti-overseas Chinese events that would be
avoided in the Chinese mainland. If private market reform would prevail one
day, along with the burgeoning of entrepeneurship which would entail free
competition.'
Mr Yang added: 'The mainland territory would offer a fabulous potential to
accommodate many competitors.'
Formosa Plastics clearly intends to be among these enterprises jostling for
a share of the world's largest potential market, whether Taipei likes it or
not.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air settles terms for
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, announced it has reached
final agreement over the restructuring of its finances and established new
labour contracts. The arrangements are effective after August 1.
On the financial side, Northwest's bankers have revised the repayment terms
on a Dollars 1.3bn term loan. Northwest must now repay Dollars 77m in 1994,
Dollars 131m in 1995, and Dollars 185m in 1996.
Repayment terms on a second, special term loan of Dollars 250m, provided
last winter, have also been adjusted. The new schedule requires the carrier
to repay Dollars 15m in 1993, Dollars 14m in 1994, Dollars 24m in 1995, and
Dollars 34m in 1996.
Owners of Northwest's series A and series B preferred stock have agreed to a
permanent dividend reduction from 14 to 8 per cent, while redemption dates
have been extended to the years 2002 and 2003. In addition, three suppliers
to the airline - Airbus, General Electric and United Technologies - are
accepting revised repayment schedules.
On the labour side, the airline's employees have agreed to make wage and
benefit concessions worth Dollars 886m over three years, and will receive
units of preferred stock in return. The size of the stock grant will be
determined by the extent of wage reduction.
In aggregate, the employees' preferred stock can be converted for a 37.5 per
cent interest in the company's ordinary equity, or redeemed for an amount
equal to the cost reductions at the end of 10 years.
Finally, Northwest's board will be expanded from 13 to 15 members, and new
directors representing the three largest labour groups - the pilots,
machinists and the flight attendants - will be appointed 'in the near
future'.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Holvis Holzstoff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holvis Holzstoff, the Swiss non-wovens group, said net profits in the first
half rose 6.8 per cent to SFr19.6m on sales up 7.7 per cent to SFr393.9m,
'in spite of unfriendly economic circumstances'.
The group, in which the British Rail Pension Fund has a 15 per cent stake,
forecast that net income in the full year would be between SFr31m and
SFr33m, broadly unchanged from last year's SFr32.7m.
Last year's figure was flattered by a SFr9m extraordinary gain on a property
sale, and this year the group has already made a SFr7.5m book profit on the
sale of Italian subsidiaries.
Holvis warned it was examining the technical state of its production
equipment. However, possible valuation adjustments 'should be covered
through available provisions for restructuring', it said.

<TEXT>
SWISSAIR, the Swiss national airline, said its first-half loss widened to
SFr125m (Dollars 82.7m), compared with a loss of SFr116m in the same period
last year.
Profit before depreciation tumbled to SFr60m from SFr81m, and the company
said it would be difficult to meet its forecast of achieving a profit this
year.
Traffic volume improved 9.5 per cent and the overall load factor rose from
59.3 per cent to 62.5 per cent. However, revenues advanced only 2 per cent
to SFr2.47bn.
Swissair said the figures reflected 'the troubled state of the world's air
transport industry, which remains plagued by a ruinous price war'. The
company foresaw no improvement in revenues in the second half, and was
continuing to concentrate on cutting costs. Costs rose 3 per cent in the
first half, to SFr2.4bn, mainly because of fuel price increases.
Depreciation charges were down from SFr197m to SFr185m. Swissair depreciates
its aircraft rapidly and sells them while still relatively new. In recent
years, only the proceeds from aircraft sales, which are booked at the
year-end, have kept the group in profit.
The airline said it had already recorded 'sizeable book profits' on aircraft
sales this year.

CHAROEN Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the main Bangkok-listed agri-industrial and
aquaculture company of the multinational CP group, has announced a rise in
second-quarter net profits, to Bt337.48m (Dollars 13.5m) from Bt293.08m in
the same quarter last year.
A poor first quarter, however, has left first-half net profits at only
Bt493.10m, compared with Bt596.65m in the the first half of 1992.
Stockbrokers in Bangkok are wary of reading too much into the figures
because of the complex links between the group's public companies and its
large private interests. However they say prawn feed sales were hit earlier
in the year by disease in Thai prawn farms.
The chicken feed business has suffered from sharp falls in the export price
of frozen chickens over the last 18 months, partly as a result of increased
competition from China.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fokus Bank, Norway's third-largest commercial bank, bounced back into the
black in the first half with a profit before extraordinary items of
NKr145.9m (Dollars 19.7m).
The result, which confirms an improving trend among Norwegian banks,
compares with a NKr175.6m loss in the same 1992 period.
The turnround was due to improved net interest, reduced loan losses and
operating costs, and profits from securities and foreign exchange dealing.
Fokus is more optimistic about its prospects than earlier in the year, when
it was looking to get back into profit by 1995. This follows a fall in
interest rates.
Mr Leif Klevan, managing director, said: 'If the positive trend in the
interest market continues, and we do not experience any unexpected losses,
then Fokus Bank will be able to close the books for the year showing an
important profit.' The bank last made a full-year profit in 1989.
The latest figures benefited from a NKr89.9m gain from the sale of
securities, compared with a NKr9.8m loss in the same 1992 period, and higher
profits from foreign exchange dealing of NKr35.1m, against NKr28.2m.
Loan losses fell to NKr199.7m from NKr404.6m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRE BYGGARE and BPA, the Swedish building groups, are combining to form
Sweden's third-largest construction group in a significant rationalisation
of the country's hard-hit building sector.
Malmo-based Tre Byggare is buying a majority stake in BPA from a group of
trade unions, and is paying for the holding by selling it's entire
shareholding in real estate company Wihlborg &amp; Sons. The deal is worth
between SKr500 (Dollars 61.7m) and SKr600m.
The new company will have 20,000 employees and an annual turnover of
SKr20bn, which puts it third in size to NCC and Skanska, Sweden's two
largest construction groups.
Mr Bengt Madsen, chairman of Tre Byggare, said the merger reflected the
collapse of the Swedish building industry and the weakness of Tre Byggare
and BPA. He said Tre Byggare's equity/assets ratio would double to 18 per
cent, and it would get a SKr600m liquidity injection as a result of the
deal.
'This is the first major merger in Sweden's current building industry
crisis. Further rationalisation in the sector will be needed as the market
is not going to increase for the next two years,' said Mr Madsen.
Later this year Tre Byggare, which is to be renamed PEAB, plans to direct an
issue of 2.5m shares to the unions, giving them a stake of around 19 per
cent in the company.

tax rebate

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CANADA reported its first profitable quarter in almost two years, helped
by a CDollars 46m (USDollars 35.7m) fuel tax rebate, writes Robert Gibbens.
The June quarter net profit was CDollars 14m, or 19 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 129m, or CDollars 1.73, a year earlier. Operating revenues
rose 2 per cent to CDollars 905m.
Second quarter operating profit was CDollars 67m, against an operating loss
of CDollars 35m.
Air Canada said despite fewer passengers carried, it was the third
consecutive quarterly gain at the operating level.
The higher yield reflected success in holding down fare discounts and
reducing surplus capacity.
'We are getting results from two years of cost-cutting and we are a smaller
but more efficient airline,' said Mr Hollis Harris, president.
The first-half loss was CDollars 279m, or CDollars 3.77, including a
CDollars 80m write-down of Air Canada's investment in GPA, the aircraft
leasing group, and a CDollars 64m provision for retirement expenses.
A year earlier the loss was CDollars 293m, or CDollars 3.96. Operating
revenues were CDollars 1.7bn, against CDollars 1.68bn.

Austrian
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA has offered fellow carrier Austrian Airlines a co-operation deal
which, if concluded, would be a blow to plans by three other airlines for a
European mega-carrier, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Lufthansa yesterday confirmed a report in a Viennese newspaper that it made
an offer for a link-up to Austria's state-owned carrier.
'We have held talks in recent weeks and have asked them to make a decision
by the end of the month,' said Mr Josef Grendel, a Lufthansa spokesman.
On Saturday, the daily Der Standard said Lufthansa presented Austrian with a
detailed proposal that could lure it away from the Alcazar plan being
negotiated with Dutch carrier KLM, Swissair and Scandinavia's SAS.
In the Alcazar project, which envisages one single big airline by 1997,
Austrian would play only a minor role, since it would only get a 10 per cent
equity stake in the venture while the others would have 30 per cent each.
Mr Grendel declined to discuss details of the German proposal, saying Der
Standard's report was on the whole correct.
He stressed the offer should be seen in the context of Lufthansa's
Europe-wide co-operation projects aimed at ensuring a more efficient use of
routes and of jet capacity.
'We want to tie partners to us' through co-operation deals so as to
distribute capacity in a more economically sensible way, Mr Grendel said.
Der Standard had quoted an unnamed supervisory board member at Austrian
Airlines as saying the Lufthansa proposal would bring the carrier
significant savings.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Buy-in team acquires Hydron for
about Pounds 27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLERGAN, the US-based drugs distributor, has sold Hydron, the contact lens
maker, to a management buy-in team for about Pounds 27m.
Mr Tim Gibson, Hydron's new managing director who led the buy-in team,
declined to disclose the full purchase price.
He said CINVen and CVC Capital Partners, who arranged the finance, had
jointly underwritten funds of Pounds 14m, entirely in equity. NatWest
Acquisition finance is understood to be providing additional banking
facilities of about Pounds 13m.
Mr David Milne, CVC assistant director, said: 'In the long run it would seem
sensible to float the company on the London Stock Exchange. But we have no
immediate plans to do so.'
Mr Gibson said: 'Hydron intends to be at the forefront of research and
development in this sector which will be key to the company maintaining and
increasing its market share.'
The deal excludes the use of the Hydron name in the US. However, the MBI
team is buying interests including manufacturing facilities in the UK
(Farnborough), Australia and Spain, the contact lens sales force, research
and development projects and the rights to patents and licences. The company
had a co-operation agreement with Allergan.
Hydron is forecasting sales of Pounds 30m for its first full year of
operation but is not disclosing any previous results.
The new, independent company is expected to employ about 500 people
worldwide and will have operations in the UK, France, Netherlands, Spain,
Italy and Austria. Hydron claims a significant share of the contact lens
markets in each of these countries.
Hydron was one of the first manufacturers makers of soft contact lens and
has been operating internationally since 1972. It was acquired by Allergan
in 1988.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mt Edon/Burmine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed three-way merger between Europa Minerals, a small UK mining
finance house, and two Australian companies with which it already has close
associations, Austmin and Burmine, is looking increasingly problematical
after a further intervention by Mount Edon, another Australian concern.
Mount Edon, which is backed by Swiss money, already owns 18 per cent of
Europa and recently made an approach which might lead to an offer for the
rest.
Now it has turned to Burmine, which some analysts believe might be its prime
target, and paid about ADollars 3.3m for an 8.8 per cent stake. Europa owns
41.8 per cent of Burmine and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa.

<TEXT>
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper company, reports turnover up from Pounds
1.3bn to Pounds 1.43bn in the six months to June 30, benefiting from
exchange rate fluctuations.
Arjo made the announcement to comply with Paris Bourse regulations, required
because St Louis, the French company, has a 39 per cent holding.
It pointed out that figures may differ from sales revenue shown when the
interim statement is published, after the usual management review.
Turnover in the first quarter was Pounds 738.1m (Pounds 668.2m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilclare, the USM-traded designer and maker of electronic security and
lighting products, recorded a profit of Pounds 16,000 in the second half.
That cut the pre-tax loss for the year ended March 31 1993 to Pounds 54,000,
compared with a profit of Pounds 58,000 in previously.
Results continued to reflect the recession in its markets and the year's
turnover fell from Pounds 3.33m to Pounds 2.9m. The second half profit was
achieved by reducing the cost base.
With the announcement of the first half loss of Pounds 70,000 the company
made a 2-for-7 rights issue at 35p to raise Pounds 240,000. The shares are
currently trading at 36p.
The dividend is held at 0.5p on the increased capital, payable November 1,
and is met from losses per share of 1.3p (earnings 2p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE showing falls of 6 per cent in turnover and profit, Crown Eyeglass
is raising its dividend by 1p to 7p for the year ended March 28.
This is a reflection of the directors' confidence. Having established a
platform for growth over the last two years, they were now looking for a
period of controlled expansion.
In the opening two months of the current year profits were ahead of budget
and of last year, they said.
In 1992-93 turnover was Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 3.99m) and pre-tax profit
Pounds 423,000 (Pounds 451,000). Earnings per share were 15.3p (19.4p) and
the final dividend is 4.5p.
The USM-quoted group, which makes spectacles and ready made reading glasses,
had consolidated its position by opening six new retail franchises in the UK
and re-establishing itself in Sweden.
Start-up costs were incurred in Sweden. The third optical centre should open
next month and additional outlets were envisaged later in the year.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Spring Ram shareholders face
further uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group, face
continuing uncertainty after a week of inconclusive bid talks and growing
tension at board level.
Masco Corporation, one of the largest building products groups in the US,
last week met Mr Roger Regan, the Yorkshire company's new chairman.
However, Spring Ram said the Masco executives only spoke in general terms
about the industry and returned to the US without making any offer.
The Yorkshire company denied reports that Masco had said it could only offer
45p a share. Last Monday Spring Ram's shares rose 15p to 69p after it
confirmed that talks had taken place with several parties, including Masco,
but emphasised that the approaches were of a preliminary nature.
However, the leaking of Masco's approach at the beginning of last week has
not helped the working relationship between Mr Regan and supporters of Mr
Bill Rooney, the co-founder of Spring Ram who lost his job as chairman but
is continuing as chief executive.
Mr Rooney's role as executive chairman was taken a fortnight ago by Mr
Regan, a building industry veteran. He was approached by institutions, led
by Prudential Corporation, after the company issued three profit warnings
within eight months, causing a collapse in its share price.
Mr Regan is working with Mr Rooney on a trial basis and if the relationship
does not work out, then Mr Regan has enough votes on the new board to sack
him.
The new chairman is now concentrating on preparing for Spring Ram's interim
results announcement on September 22, and has said he is not interested in
'bargain-hunters'.
Mr Regan and Mr Martin Towers, his new finance director, are being assisted
in their investigations into the company by the Liverpool office of Price
Waterhouse, the accountants. Price Waterhouse is likely to replace Spring
Ram's existing auditors, Arthur Andersen, which signed off the annual
accounts without qualification.

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Seeking a fortune in London -
The listing of the first 'red chip' company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVERSE takeover of a UK listed company by a Hong Kong trading concern as
a means of increasing sales of oil to communist China might seem a rather
tortuous way of going about it. But such is the deal which will lead to the
appearance of a new name on the London stock exchange tomorrow: Fortune Oil.
The company has emerged from the acquisition by Blackland Oil, a USM-traded
company, of Kingsleigh Petroleum of Hong Kong. Blackland had suffered a
string of lossmaking years and was heavily indebted. But its reverse
takeover by Kingsleigh will enable it to issue Pounds 27m of new shares to
the vendors, and make a placing of Pounds 10m additional shares in the
market.
Blackland's original shareholders will end up owning only one per cent of
Fortune stock, Kingsleigh's owners will have 70 per cent, and the rest of
the shareholders will come through the placing.
The deal was constructed in this way to enable Kingsleigh to tap the London
market's large oil and gas sector and obtain a listing. The Hong Kong market
lists no oil and gas companies and gave Kingsleigh no prospect of being able
to do the deal on its home turf, according to Mr Malcolm Stone, the vice
chairman.
He expects to pick up 500-600 shareholders through the placing.
Kingsleigh was set up in 1989 to trade crude oil and petroleum products
mainly with China, with which it has close links. Its shareholders (who will
now be in Fortune) include the founding families from the Far East, as well
as several Chinese state corporations, such as China National Electronics
Import &amp; Export, China National Aero-Technology Import and Export, and China
North Industries.
In fact, it is believed that Fortune will become the London Exchange's first
'red chip' company with direct Chinese state ownership.
The immediate prospects of Fortune are built round China's expected need for
fast-rising oil imports. With an annual growth rate of 9 per cent, the
economy is outstripping the capacity of its domestic oil industry. Although
China is a large oil producer, it cannot meet its needs in full, and its
best reserves are located in the north west of the country, far from the
consuming centres.
This has produced shortages in the booming provinces of the south east,
where enterprises have been released from their obligation to import oil
through the state oil monopoly.
Fortune has a scheme to install a floating mooring 15km off the south China
coast linked by subsea pipeline to the mainland Guangdong province. This
will enable oil to be delivered to China in much larger crude carriers than
can currently access its ports, and therefore more cheaply.
The installation will be in operation by the end of next year with a
capacity of 200,000 barrels a day, or 10m tonnes a year. There will also be
storage facilities on shore. The project will cost Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m)
which is being financed by a bank loan.
Fortune has a take-or-pay contract for 3m tonnes a year with the Maoming
refinery which is linked to the landing point by a pipeline. This will rise
to 5m tonnes in 1998. Maoming is also a shareholder in Fortune with 2.6 per
cent stake.
Mr Ng Juak Khoon, a Fortune executive, stresses that while the mooring buoy
is key to the strategy, he sees it as the basis for a much wider business in
China which will include trading petroleum products and even liquefied
natural gas. 'The buoy is an extension of our trading business,' he says.
At present there are only two refineries serving the six Chinese provinces
within striking distance of the facility, but three more are planned.
Proceeds of the Pounds 10m placing will help pay down debt and leave the
group with about Pounds 5m for additional investments. Some of this will be
used in the UK where Blackland has interests in some small oilfields in
Lincolnshire.
But investor interest in Fortune will doubtless centre most closely on the
'China factor' - the country's rapid rate of growth and its growing
commercialisation. However Mr Ian Taylor, the chief operating officer, says:
'We don't want the China hype. We want the China interest.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Colorgen acts to dampen
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COLORGEN has sought to dampen speculation by forecasting a 9 per cent rise
in annual profits before tax and exceptionals to about Dollars 1m (Pounds
600,000) for the year to the end of June.
The announcement was made following the recent erratic trading of the
USM-traded shares of this US-based colour matching specialist.
Sales were estimated to have increased from Dollars 11m to about Dollars
14m. The results are expected to be published in October.
Mr Peter Wall, managing director, said the board had decided to issue the
forecast following speculation that profits might be as high as Dollars 2m.
Colorgen has also been the focus recently of takeover speculation, which on
one day last month sent its shares 5p higher to 33p. Mr Wall dismissed the
rumours as 'absolute rubbish', pointing out that the board controlled more
than 50 per cent of the shares.
On Friday the shares closed 1 1/2 p up at 34 1/2 p.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Home territory under threat: Upheavals in German insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allianz's international competitors may have breathed a sigh of relief when
Europe's largest insurance company reported its 1992 results.
For the first time in more than 20 years the group lost money - some DM400m
(Pounds 156m) - on its insurance operations in the traditionally profitable
German market. Allianz's after-tax profits were down by 18.1 per cent to
DM857.9m and overall underwriting operations remained in deficit for the
second year running.
After a long period of relentless expansion, Allianz's difficulties reflect
the radical changes affecting the traditionally stable, heavily regulated
and highly profitable German insurance market.
German insurers have long enjoyed wide margins on home, motor and life
policies, paying out less in claims and expenses than they receive in
premiums. But this has begun to change as a result of several factors:
A sharp increase in car thefts since the opening of borders with eastern
Europe and German reunification in 1990. Some 87,000 cars were stolen in
1991, rising to more than 130,000 last year. Allianz's losses from theft
rose by 15-20 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
Volatile weather patterns. Storm losses at Allianz totalled DM200m in the
first six months, up more than 40 per cent. One hail-storm alone, which
swept across southern Germany, cost the company DM60m in claims.
The cost of expanding eastwards. Allianz moved into eastern Germany with the
DM711m acquisition of Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state insurance
monopoly. Losses are expected to mount to DM1.5bn before the acquisition
starts to make a profit in the latter half of the decade. Other German
companies are also incurring heavy losses as they build up operations in
eastern Germany from scratch.
Increased competition from banks. As in other countries, German banks have
diversified into insurance on the assumption that the distinction between
banking and life insurance products is narrowing. Deutsche Bank set up a
life insurance company in 1989 and has since acquired stakes in Deutsche
Herold, a life insurance company, and Gerling, a large industrial insurer.
The pressures will intensify next year. By July 1994, the European
Commission's single market programme will allow insurers from all EC states
direct access to each other's markets. At the same time, new European rules
will force the German supervisory authorities to scrap restrictions on both
prices and policy wordings. Motor liability business and life business will
be directly affected by the changes, but analysts expect competition to
become more intense in other classes too.
These changes should present opportunities for international competitors to
increase their share of the German market from their current 13 per cent.
Already foreign companies are seeking to take advantage. In particular,
France's two largest insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) - are keen to expand in Germany as part
of their broader European ambitions.
UAP - through its 34 per cent holding in Victoire - owns a sizeable minority
stake in Colonia, Germany's third biggest insurer, and is seeking to
increase it. Recently AGF, the second largest state-controlled French
company, acquired a 33 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs
(AMB), the second biggest insurance group in Germany.
'Any major insurer with a pan-European strategy would like eventually to
have a position in Germany because it is Europe's largest country and
because it is perceived to be a good place to expand from into eastern
Europe,' says Mr Stephen Dias, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
Allianz's senior executives appear unruffled by the market turbulence and
the threat of increased competition.
Mr Uwe Haasen, head of German operations at Allianz, concedes that 1993 will
be another tough year with losses in Germany running at a high level in the
first six months. But he is confident that this will prove to be a temporary
dip.
Most analysts covering the company agree, citing a number of factors that
will shield it from the impact of greater competiton. First, its 17 per cent
share of the German general insurance market is nearly three times greater
than that of its closest rival, the Colonia Group - and is one of the
reasons it enjoys lower costs. Allianz's expense ratio, which measures costs
as a percentage of premium income, amounts to 21 per cent, several points
less than most of its competitors not only in Germany but in the broader
European market.
Unlike many of its UK rivals who distribute their products through
independent brokers, Allianz also controls its sales outlets. Its network of
8,000 full-time and 40,000-50,000 part-time exclusive agents, helps it
retain customer loyalty and makes it difficult for competitors to take
market share. Allianz retains 90-95 per cent of its customers each year,
compared with 75-80 per cent for UK companies.
Allianz's property and financial assets - often valued at the cost at which
they were acquired rather than their present market value - represent a huge
store of hidden wealth. Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital
Markets, estimates that unrealised capital appreciation on Allianz's 25 per
cent holding in Munich Re, Germany's largest reinsurance company, exceeded
DM1.1bn last year.
And unlike some of its German competitors, Allianz has already begun to
reorganise its operations to adjust to the expected increase in competition.
At the beginning of 1992 Allianz announced a reorganisation of its business
on the basis of customer types: individual customers; small businesses;
multinational businesses.
Finally, following its rapid expansion abroad in the late 1980s, Allianz is
no longer so dependent on its domestic market. In 1992 subsidiaries in the
US, the UK, Italy, France and elsewhere generated nearly half of the
DM54.7bn premium income. More recently it has begun to move into Asia,
announcing a joint venture with the Japanese retail company, Nichii, to sell
personal accident and liability insurances in 50 department stores from the
autumn.
Premium income is expected to grow to more than DM60bn in 1994, with general
business now as large as the four biggest UK insurance companies together.
It looks as though, even with the problems of the German market, there will
be little respite for Allianz's rivals.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Fund managers go for European shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN equities, and French shares in particular, have seen a surge in
popularity among UK fund managers, according to the latest Smith New
Court/Gallup Survey of fund managers released today.
A balance of 37 per cent of fund managers questioned in themonthly survey
said they planned to increase their holdings in continental European
equities, compared with only 13 per cent in the July survey. The balance of
fund managers refers to the difference between institutions who are bullish
and those who are bearish about a market.
The sharp rise in the popularity of European equities probably stems from
the recent shake-up of the European exchange rate mechanism, seen as paving
the way for official interest rates to tumble across continental Europe,
which investors hope will stimulate economic recovery.
On the European front, 87 per cent of fund managers said they preferred
French equities to German ones as an investment.
Meanwhile, a balance of 33 per cent of managers said they intended to raise
their weightings in UK shares, up from 12 per cent in July. A much higher
proportion of fund managers now think that the outlook for the UK economy
over the next 12 months is brightening: 34 per cent said it would 'get a lot
better', compared with 17 per cent.
Expected earnings per share growth for 1994 has jumped from 14.4 per cent to
15.7 per cent.
Institutional investors have lowered their inflation forecasts, predicting
that the Retail Price Index will be 2.7 per cent by the end of 1993 and 3.7
per cent by the end of 1994.
On the fixed income side, a balance of 11 per cent of fund managers said
they would decrease their holdings in gilts, compared with 1 per cent the
previous month, and a balance of 7 per cent said they would decrease their
holdings in overseas bonds and deposits, whereas a balance of 3 per cent
planned to increase exposure last month.
According to the survey, pension fund assets are allocated as follows: UK

FT  09 AUG 93 / Home territory under threat: Upheavals in German insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allianz's international competitors may have breathed a sigh of relief when
Europe's largest insurance company reported its 1992 results.
For the first time in more than 20 years the group lost money - some DM400m
(Pounds 156m) - on its insurance operations in the traditionally profitable
German market. Allianz's after-tax profits were down by 18.1 per cent to
DM857.9m and overall underwriting operations remained in deficit for the
second year running.
After a long period of relentless expansion, Allianz's difficulties reflect
the radical changes affecting the traditionally stable, heavily regulated
and highly profitable German insurance market.
German insurers have long enjoyed wide margins on home, motor and life
policies, paying out less in claims and expenses than they receive in
premiums. But this has begun to change as a result of several factors:
A sharp increase in car thefts since the opening of borders with eastern
Europe and German reunification in 1990. Some 87,000 cars were stolen in
1991, rising to more than 130,000 last year. Allianz's losses from theft
rose by 15-20 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
Volatile weather patterns. Storm losses at Allianz totalled DM200m in the
first six months, up more than 40 per cent. One hail-storm alone, which
swept across southern Germany, cost the company DM60m in claims.
The cost of expanding eastwards. Allianz moved into eastern Germany with the
DM711m acquisition of Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state insurance
monopoly. Losses are expected to mount to DM1.5bn before the acquisition
starts to make a profit in the latter half of the decade. Other German
companies are also incurring heavy losses as they build up operations in
eastern Germany from scratch.
Increased competition from banks. As in other countries, German banks have
diversified into insurance on the assumption that the distinction between
banking and life insurance products is narrowing. Deutsche Bank set up a
life insurance company in 1989 and has since acquired stakes in Deutsche
Herold, a life insurance company, and Gerling, a large industrial insurer.
The pressures will intensify next year. By July 1994, the European
Commission's single market programme will allow insurers from all EC states
direct access to each other's markets. At the same time, new European rules
will force the German supervisory authorities to scrap restrictions on both
prices and policy wordings. Motor liability business and life business will
be directly affected by the changes, but anlysts expect competition to
become more intense in other classes too.
These changes should present opportunities for international competitors to
increase their share of the German market from their current 13 per cent.
Already foreign companies are seeking to take advantage. In particular,
France's two largest insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) - are keen to expand in Germany as part
of their broader European ambitions.
UAP - through its 34 per cent holding in Victoire - owns a sizeable minority
stake in Colonia, Germany's third biggest insurer, and is seeking to
increase it. Recently AGF, the second largest state-controlled French
company, acquired a 33 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs
(AMB), the second biggest insurance group in Germany.
'Any major insurer with a pan-European strategy would like eventually to
have a position in Germany because it is Europe's largest country and
because it is perceived to be a good place to expand from into eastern
Europe,' says Mr Stephen Dias, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
Allianz's senior executives appear unruffled by the market turbulence and
the threat of increased competition.
Mr Uwe Haasen, head of German operations at Allianz, concedes that 1993 will
be another tough year with losses in Germany running at a high level in the
first six months. But he is confident that this will prove to be a temporary
dip.
Most analysts covering the company agree, citing a number of factors that
will shield it from the impact of greater competiton. First, its 17 per cent
share of the German general insurance market is nearly three times greater
than that of its closest rival, the Colonia Group - and is one of the
reasons it enjoys lower costs. Allianz's expense ratio, which measures costs
as a percentage of premium income, amounts to 21 per cent, several points
less than most of its competitors not only in Germany but in the broader
European market.
Unlike many of its UK rivals who distribute their products through
independent brokers, Allianz also controls its sales outlets. Its network of
8,000 full-time and 40,000-50,000 part-time exclusive agents, helps it
retain customer loyalty and makes it difficult for competitors to take
market share. Allianz retains 90-95 per cent of its customers each year,
compared with 75-80 per cent for UK companies.
Allianz's property and financial assets - often valued at the cost at which
they were acquired rather than their present market value - represent a huge
store of hidden wealth. Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital
Markets, estimates that unrealised capital appreciation on Allianz's 25 per
cent holding in Munich Re, Germany's largest reinsurance company, exceeded
DM1.1bn last year.
And unlike some of its German competitors, Allianz has already begun to
reorganise its operations to adjust to the expected increase in competition.
At the beginning of 1992 Allianz announced a reorganisation of its business
on the basis of customer types: individual customers; small businesses;
multinational businesses.
Finally, following its rapid expansion abroad in the late 1980s, Allianz is
no longer so dependent on its domestic market. In 1992 subsidiaries in the
US, the UK, Italy, France and elsewhere generated nearly half of the
DM54.7bn premium income. More recently it has begun to move into Asia,
announcing a joint venture with the Japanese retail company, Nichii, to sell
personal accident and liability insurances in 50 department stores from the
autumn.
Premium income is expected to grow to more than DM60bn in 1994, with general
business now as large as the four biggest UK insurance companies together.
It looks as though, even with the problems of the German market, there will
be little respite for Allianz's rivals.

GALERIES Lafayette, La Redoute and a number of other leading French retail
groups have highlighted the depressed state of the retail sector by
announcing falls in sales for the first half of the year.
French retailing has come under intense pressure in recent months as the
economy has slid into recession.
The reductions in interest rates since the March parliamentary elections
have so far failed to stimulate consumer spending. Confidence is still weak
because of the continuing rise in unemployment.
As a result, many large retail groups saw sales fall in the first six months
of the year.
Galeries Lafayette, the department store concern, reported a 7 per cent
reduction in sales from FFr14.87bn in the first half of 1992 to FFr13.8bn in
the same period of this year. The group has been affected not only by the
French recession but also by problems at its flagship store in New York.
Monoprix, the chain of mixed merchandise stores belonging to the Galeries
Lafayette group, also registered a fall in interim sales. Its turnover
slipped by 5.7 per cent from FFr4.97bn to FFr4.68bn.
La Redoute, the dominant player in the French mail order market, saw its
sales decline by 3.6 per cent from FFr8.91bn in the first six months of last
year to FFr8.58bn.
BHV, one of whose best known interests is a department store beside the
Hotel de Ville in Paris, suffered a reduction in first-half sales of 6.7 per
cent to FFr1.75bn from FFr1.88bn.
The news of these falls in sales, which reflects the generally gloomy trend
in the French industrial and service sectors, comes at a turbulent time for
French retailing.
The strains on the sector have triggered a stream of takeover activity.
Concentration of ownership has increased as large groups, such as
Pinault-Printemps, Carrefour and Galeries Lafayette, have expanded by
acquisition.
Similarly, a number of new players have surfaced in French retailing,
notably Tesco, the UK food retailer which took over Catteau supermarkets,
and Kingfisher, the UK group that now owns the Darty electricals chain.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Chinese interest in UK flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week will bring the first listing on the London stock market of a
company involving Chinese state ownership, with the quotation tomorrow of
Fortune Oil.
Fortune is aiming to capitalise on the rapidly rising stream of oil imports
into China.
The company was created via the acquisition by Blackland Oil, a former
London USM company, of Kingsleigh Petroleum of Hong Kong.
Kingsleigh's shareholders, which now become investors in Fortune Oil,
include such leading Chinese state corporations as China National
Electronics Import and Export, China National Aero-Technology Import &amp;
Export, and China North Industries.
The new company has been floated in London because the Hong Kong stock
market lists no oil and gas companies.
Kingsleigh's owners will hold 70 per cent of Fortune's stock, with Blackland
holding only 1 per cent. The rest of the new shareholders, expected to
number between 500 and 600, will enter through the London placing of Pounds
10m of new shares.
About half of the proceeds of the London placing will be used to pay down
debt, with the rest available for additional investments, some in
Blackland's interests in small oilfields in Lincolnshire.
Fortune plans a Dollars 25m off-shore mooring project and also has a
contract with the Maoming refinery, which is one of Fortune's shareholders.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: Tax fears put blight on US budget relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's long-awaited deficit reduction act has, at last,
scraped its way through both Houses of Congress. But, despite the palpable
sighs of relief in Washington at the weekend, some economists fear that his
plan could deliver the worst of both worlds.
Their worry is that the revenue-raising credentials of Mr Clinton's
seemingly dour package of tax increases and spending cuts have been
over-sold: the promised cuts in the US budget deficit will not materialise,
but Mr Clinton will nonetheless get the blame for scaring the American
economy out of the recovery it needs.
For, whatever communication problems the Clinton administration may have had
over the past few months, the package has come with a clear message that
taxes will rise. Not surprisingly, consumer and business confidence have
fallen sharply this year.
The US consumer confidence index, calculated by the Conference Board, a New
York Business analysis group, fell to 57.7 in July, the lowest level since
last October and sharply down from 76.7 in January. The index of business
confidence fell to 57 in the second quarter, from 66 in the first quarter,
its lowest level since the end of 1991.
Yet, despite popular fears that the tax burden will rise, Professor Martin
Feldstein, head of the economics department at Harvard University and
erstwhile chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers,
contends that many of the projected tax revenues will not materialise.
A longstanding critic of the Clinton tax plan, Professor Feldstein claims
that many of the tax changes - such as raising the income tax rate on
individuals earning over Dollars 115,000 from 31 to 36 per cent  - are so
badly designed that taxpayers only need to change their behaviour a little
for many of the projected new revenues to evaporate.
According to his calculations, if high-earning individuals are able to lower
their taxable income by just 10 per cent of gross adjusted income, then the
US Treasury will only see about a quarter of the additional revenues it
might have hoped for. The Administration's projections made little allowance
for such changes of behaviour as tax avoidance or reduced work effort.
Ironically, the government's reluctant decision to back-date income tax
increases to the beginning of 1993, rather than have them start from June 30
as originally planned, provides a short-term answer to Professor Feldstein's
criticisms. At least in the first round of revenue-collecting, the
government is more likely to collect the full increases because they have
been sprung on individuals after the event.
Mr David Hale, an investment analyst at Kemper Financial services in
Chicago, claims that apprehension about Mr Clinton's economic plans is
behind the recent slump in consumer and business confidence. He says most
households are concerned about the Clinton tax programme 'despite the fact
that most of the tax increases will fall on incomes above Dollars 100,000.'
It is not so much the fine print of Mr Clinton's package that is denting
confidence.
More important has been the plan's tax-raising reputation and a sense of
foreboding about what has not yet been unveiled. The Administrations's plans
for reforming the health and benefit system look set to involve further
increases in marginal tax rates on wages.
According to Mr Hale, companies, especially small ones, are also worried
about the impact of the Clinton health and other programmes. Their fear that
these will increase labour costs partly explains why many have chosen to
lengthen the working week as demand has risen, rather than take on new
staff.
These corporate worries are bad news for the US economy. Mr Clinton's
emphasis on taxing labour - both in the deficit package and through the most
likely options for health funding - may have contributed to the uneven
recovery in the US jobs market which has accompanied the upturn.
Mr Clinton must hope that the negative effects of this uncertainty on
economic growth are more than offset by the positive effect that cutting the
deficit should have on investment and thus on America's long-term growth
rate. Countries with higher national savings rates tend also to have higher
rates of domestic investment in industry.
By persuading the financial markets that the government is going to cut the
deficit, the budget package should bring down long-term interest rates and
makes it cheaper for companies to borrow funds. However watered-down the
agreed deficit package, Mr Clinton appears to have been remarkably
successful in reassuring the markets. Long-term bond yields, for instance,
are at historically low levels.
Entirely by accident, Mr Clinton's economic policy appears to have achieved
a second success over the past few months by persuading consumers to
postpone their spending decisions. For it is not just the American
government which consumes too much and saves too little.
While the high federal budget deficit eats up too much of the nation's
savings pie, the spending habits of American consumers make it a smaller pie
to begin with. Of the 5.6 percentage point decline in US national savings as
a proportion of gross domestic product since 1980, 3.4 percentage points can
be traced to higher public borrowing. The remainder is due to a fall in
saving by the American personal sector.
By inducing consumers to save more than they need to pay their expected tax
bill, Mr Clinton's fiscal reform might also boost US investment by raising
national savings.
US personal savings, as a percentage of disposable income, rose to 4.9 per
cent in the first three months of this year from 4.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1992, though the signs are that the trend has not continued.
Mr Clinton can rightly be blamed for allowing uncertainty and fear about his
tax plans to threaten America's nascent recovery. But, by pushing up private
savings, he has also achieved, albeit in an accidental and haphazard manner,
what many would have him plan to do on a permanent basis.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Serbs to quit Sarajevo peaks: Promise seen as attempt to
forestall Nato air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN SERBS agreed last night to a phased withdrawal from two strategic
mountains overlooking the besieged capital, Sarajevo, so as to allow United
Nations peacekeeping troops to occupy the peaks.
The agreement with UN commanders came after Bosnia's Moslem President Alija
Izetbegovic warned that peace talks in Geneva would collapse unless Nato
launched air strikes against Serb artillery around Sarajevo.
British Brigadier Vere Hayes said UN troops would occupy one of the peaks,
Mount Bjelasnica, this morning, when the Bosnian Serbs would pull out. He
said 150 French troops would go today to Mount Igman, nearer Sarajevo. The
Serbs have promised to quit this peak in the next few days.
The Serbs took the two mountains from Moslem forces in an unexpected
offensive last week, tightening their stranglehold on the Bosnian capital,
which has been under siege from Serb snipers and artillery for 16 months.
The pledges of withdrawal are an apparent attempt to forestall air strikes,
under discussion by the Nato alliance, and to put moral pressure on the
Moslem-led government to resume the Geneva talks on carving up Bosnia
largely on ethnic lines.
President Izetbegovic said earlier he thought air strikes against Serb
positions had 'never been closer' than now. 'I can say if there are no air
strikes, then there is no peace process, no negotiations,' he said in an
interview on the eve of scheduled talks with Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan
Karadzic and his Croat counterpart Mr Mate Boban.
However, Nato officials indicated Mr Izetbegovic's urging was likely to get
a cool reception when Nato ambassadors meet in Brussels today to discuss
possible air strikes. Nato did not intend the Bosnian Moslems to use the
hope of military intervention as an excuse for stalling talks, an official
said.
Today's meeting is expected to agree on logistics for any future air
strikes, out of a list of options finalised by the Nato military committee
in Brussels at the weekend. But officials warned that the allies were
unlikely today to authorise air strikes as there were still significant
differences about the scope and timing of any action.
In sharp criticism of western policy, Mr Izetbegovic singled out the UK for
undermining his government over the past 16 months of war. 'They had two
ways to help; either directly through intervention or to lift the arms
embargo,' he said. 'They did not do anything. Now we are left with our hands
tied.'
But indicating he had accepted Bosnia's tripartite division, he outlined
what he called his minimum requirements for Moslems: 'A fair map for the
Bosnian republic with access to the River Sava and the sea. We must have
territory covering an area suitable for 2.5m citizens. We need a geographic
and viable state.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / Business group attacks plan to deregulate London's buses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON FIRST, the business-led organisation set up last year with strong
government backing to map a strategy for development of the British capital,
has added its voice to criticism of government proposals to deregulate the
city's buses.
In a policy paper London First warns that deregulation could 'undermine the
effectiveness of London's transport system' if current plans are not
modified.
It warns that the current powers of London's Traffic Commissioner 'would not
be sufficient to avoid the chaos that could ensue on London's roads'.
Outside London, it says, deregulation has generally been accompanied by
falling bus usage.
'In most areas deregulation has led to significant dislocation in services
and confusion for passengers, particularly in the first 2-3 years after
introduction.'
London First - set up last October to provide strategic thinking to maintain
and enhance London's reputation as a world-class city - has no formal
political affiliation. It has support from more than 40 companies, the
Confederation of British Industry, London Tourist Board, Business in the
Community, and London Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry.
It says in the policy paper that it is 'critical' for the government to
avoid a 'rapid and wholesale' move to deregulation and urges ministers to
incorporate three main elements into proposals under development.
The government should: Upgrade bus travel infrastructure such as information
systems and ticketing.
Establish a 'sound' base of competitors.
Provide an effective operating environment.
Without these elements deregulation has the potential to 'jeopardise the
significant improvements already achieved' in London's bus operating
efficiency and service quality.
The government's plans to bring London into line with bus services outside
the capital, which were deregulated in the mid-1980s, have been criticised
by local authorities and London Transport on the grounds they will lead to
road congestion and fare rises.
The Commons transport committee said last month the government should think
again if its plans would mean abandoning the travelcard season ticket.
Ministers are expected to bring forward legislation for deregulation in the
next session of parliament beginning in November.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, conceded earlier this year that
fine-tuning of the government's plans might be needed.
But Mr Steven Norris, a junior transport minister, told the transport
committee in May that deregulation would proceed since this was the only way
'to offer the services people want'.
Measures urged by London First include:
Implementing bus priority measures within four years on at least half of the
designated 600 miles of key routes. Ensuring the Countdown real time
passenger information system is 'fully tested and rolled out' before
deregulation.
Pressing ahead with an agreed system of electronic ticketing to help ensure
network and concessionary fare schemes are protected.
Imposing operating controls on access to key routes and bus stops.

FT  09 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the ERM looks likely to take some of the shine off the Swiss
equity market. Its safe haven status has helped it rise by a third over the
past year, but now other European markets may outperform as interest rates
come down. Switzerland has to a large extent already enjoyed the relaxation
that is expected elsewhere. Short-term rates are only about one point above
the 3.4 per cent inflation rate. So the Swiss National Bank has less room
for manoeuvre than, say, France. It may do little more than follow German
rates down, which suggests a strong Swiss franc may dampen domestic recovery
prospects.
Some local factors also point to a period of consolidation. Nestle's share
price has finally become caught up in the international anxiety over brands;
there is a risk that the banks, in which the market has invested a lot of
hope, may disappoint at the interim stage. It would be a mistake, though, to
take this argument too far. The Swiss market's long climb has been sustained
by fundamental under-valuation as well as its safe haven status. The former
consideration remains valid.
Consensus expectations for earnings growth of about 17 per cent this year
put the market on a forward multiple of around 12, which makes it cheap by
international standards. And it is not as if interest rates were actually
about to rise. The safe haven advantage may even return if other European
governments compound currency uncertainty by delaying interest rate cuts.
Swiss equities can still scale new peaks, but it will require a little more
exertion than before.

Those French politicians who complain about the Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to
destroy European monetary union may wish to hedge their position by buying
Reuters' shares. The company's rapidly advancing share price performance
highlights the market's belief that Reuters will gain from currency turmoil.
The connection is not immediate since the bulk of Reuters' forex trading
screens generate their income from subscription fees rather than transaction
charges. But the hope is that banks, which have been running down their
European forex operations, may build them up again if the likelihood of
monetary union recedes. Reuters would then install more screens. After
several years of static installations, Reuters would return to the growth
path.
The theory, though, is somewhat spurious. Despite the recent beating, the
concept of a single currency may be far from dead. Moreover, any likely rise
in demand for screens would be marginal set against the 200,000 screens
Reuters already has installed. Nevertheless, the market's instinct may prove
right over the longer run. The infant Dealing 2000 forex trading system,
which appears to be gaining critical mass, produces Dollars 25 of income for
every deal transacted. Here, volume will clearly be critical for
profitability. The product, though, will not contribute significantly to
profits for a few years yet. By then, Reuters hopes that even if European
foreign exchange trading quietens down, there will be increased trade
between the world's more exotic currencies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It does not take much to tickle a fund manager's jaded palate. Some
reasonable retail sales figures, a spurt in the circulation of folding
money, and a whiff of interest rate cuts from across the channel is enough
to have professional investors switching into UK consumer stocks in the hope
of a boost to domestic consumption. Certainly macro-economic forecasts
suggest that consumer spending will rise faster now the ERM has gone. There
are also worries that the capital goods and export earning companies which
have led the market's charge since sterling's exit from the ERM may not look
quite so glamorous once their interim figures arrive in September.
In the short term some stores do hold attractions. Despite tough trading
conditions the big four, Marks and Spencer, Kingfisher, GUS and Boots the
Chemist, seem to be gaining market share from independent retailers and
weaker chains. Those with the muscle to provide competitive pricing and
value are gaining sales without damaging margins. That squeezes those chains
which are stuck with a cycle of seasonal sales to shift stock which will not
sell at full margins.
Further out, however, there are worries. The November Budget can only
depress consumer confidence, even if some of the more aggressive tax
increases are avoided. Consumer perceptions of value will continue to limit
the ability to increase margins and the threat of discount formats remains
on the horizon. The advocates of Everyday Low Pricing may have the right
tactics for the market, but it is hardly a way to get rich quick.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US government long bond yields around 6.5 per cent hardly suggest that the
markets are bothered by the Federal government's budget deficit. President
Clinton, however, may be making a mistake when he claims credit for the bond
market's recent strength. US growth is still very sluggish and, despite an
uptick in the second quarter, inflation is subdued. That is probably more
responsible for low bond yields than the president's deficit reduction
package. Besides, the national debt and the size of the budget deficit as a
proportion of GDP hardly stand out against other OECD countries.
What is more worrying is the way that the politicians have struggled so
mightily to bring forth such a weak compromise. Passing the bill was
certainly important, given that Mr Clinton had invested so much political
capital in it. Yet even on the government's own figures, the deficit will
still be Dollars 250bn by 1998, and spending will have risen by 20 per cent
 -always supposing that expenditure estimates are not exceeded in the way
they have been in the past. To be sure, the markets would have responded
very badly had the vote failed, and the president's authority been
significantly weakened. Now it has passed, the focus will be on slow growth.
With little sign of the recovery gathering pace, Treasury bonds may well
rally further. Equities may also benefit. For those still prepared to
overlook the monotonous regularity of exceptional charges in US company
results, there is little reason to suppose that equity prices are stretched
beyond the limit.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's taxing deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRESIDENT who fought primary campaigns on the slogan 'America can't wait'
would doubtless have wanted it to have arrived sooner. But last Friday,
after six months' hard wrangling, a version of Mr Clinton's deficit
reduction package finally scraped its way out of the US Congress and into
law. The deal, for all its flaws, should prove something of a landmark in
recent American political history. But Mr Clinton must deliver a great deal
more over the next three years if the same is to be said of his presidency.
Judged by its deficit-reducing credentials, the deal is not so different
from the plan which Mr Clinton unveiled early in the year. It aims to reduce
the US federal budget deficit by Dollars 496bn over the next five years by
means of public spending cuts which net Dollars 255bn and tax increases of
Dollars 241bn. Total tax revenues will rise by an estimated 0.8 per cent of
gross domestic product in the 1993 fiscal year.
But much of the package's earlier novelty has been lost. First, the US
administration has been forced, in effect, to drop its broad-based energy
tax in the face of interest group pressure. The energy tax would have raised
Dollars 71bn over five years and, in so doing, would have begun the
necessary process of bringing US energy prices into line with those in other
industrial countries. In its place, the Senate has sanctioned a rather
paltry 4.3 cents rise in the tax on most transport fuels which will bring in
a mere Dollars 24.2bn in extra revenue.
Earlier casualty
An earlier casualty was the new administration's plans for increased
infrastructure spending. Mr Clinton had planned to boost spending on all
forms of public capital. But US economists now estimate that US public
investment will fall by 6.6 per cent this year. There is now nothing in the
agreed package to reverse America's long-standing inability, by the
standards of other industrialised countries, to maintain a large and healthy
stock of public capital.
Missing, too, from the package is evidence that President Clinton knows how
to translate his pre-election commitment to 'putting people first' into
post-election actions that enhance capital of the human variety. Instead,
just when Europe's leaders are concluding that high labour taxes are bad for
employment, Mr Clinton has fallen back on taxes on labour income to get his
deficit proposals through - and looks set to do the same in his plans for
reforming the US health system. The long-term solution to America's fiscal
difficulties must involve some form of value-added consumption tax, not
further taxes on employment.
Bigger cut
For all its deficiencies, Mr Clinton's bill should mean a bigger cut in the
federal budget deficit than any of his predecessors have delivered. For all
its ostensible similarities with President Bush's 1990 Budget Enforcement
Act, the Clinton plan should do better, if only because it catches the
economy on the way out of a recession as opposed to on the way in.
Nor is the strength of recovery likely to be seriously undermined by last
week's bill - at least not once most consumers discover that their tax bills
are little changed. If anything, Mr Clinton's legislative success should
make the recovery more sustainable by keeping long-term bond yields at the
historically low levels to which they fell in February when the package was
first unveiled.
Yet, in the medium term, America's budget difficulties, and the political
chasm they reflect, are not solved by the events of last week. However
impressed the markets appear to be today, by 1998 the US structural budget
deficit is projected to return to nearly 3 per cent of GDP and keep on
rising thereafter.
Whether Mr Clinton is in the White House to see this will depend, in large
part, on the strength of the recovery. But whether he will be judged a great
president will depend on his ability not only to begin tracing solutions to
America's looming structural problems - its bloated and ineffective social
security and healthcare systems - but to persuade both Congress and the
American people that his solutions make sense. Last week's victory marked a
beginning. That so much political energy was expended for so little does not
bode well.

FT  09 AUG 93 / And the eldest takes all / A look at the debate over
primogeniture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not since the days of King Herod has it been so rough for firstborn sons.
Last week, the Marquess of Blandford decided to fight the court action of
his father, the Duke of Marlborough, who is effectively trying to disinherit
him; more than 30 peers have supported a bill to allow hereditary peerages
to pass to the eldest child, regardless of gender; and increasingly, the
landed gentry are giving their children equal slices of the inheritance
cake.
It is remarkable that the seemingly anachronistic concept of primogeniture -
whereby the eldest son inherits all - exists at all in a world of positive
discrimination and Nintendo. In the words of Mr Nick Howard, second of the
four scions of Castle Howard in Yorkshire: 'It is the last refuge of
feudalism.'
This Norman law of inheritance lasted until 1925, when land legislation
removed the right of the eldest to inherit all from an intestate parent by
allowing the widow some chattels for herself.
Save for hereditary dignities and titles of honour, primogeniture no longer
has legal force. Only hereditary peers list heirs in Who's Who. But
primogeniture has remained a custom that aristocrats have observed
unquestioningly for almost 1,000 years until this month's action in the High
Court.
As Mr Lawrence Stone, professor of history at Princeton University in the
US, points out, the 'prime preoccupation of a wealthy English landed squire
was somehow to contrive to preserve his family inheritance intact and to
pass it on to the next generation according to the principle of
primogeniture'.
While wealthy squires' objectives have not changed, their methods may be
about to. If the Duke of Marlborough wins, he will set a precedent that
others will find hard to ignore. By demolishing the assumption that the
eldest son should take over, he is subjecting the business of succession to
commercial reality.
The duke wants to prevent his son from automatically inheriting Blenheim
Palace and its 11,500 acres. He is so anxious that control of the estate
should not fall to the marquess (who is being treated for drug addiction)
that he is seeking to overturn the Act of Parliament of 1704 that gave
Blenheim to his ancestor, the 1st Duke of Marlborough, in acknowledgement of
his victories on the battlefield.
He wants a new trust to replace the present settlement. This trust would
tightly control the sale of land, heirlooms and building on the estate.
Nothing can prevent Jamie Blandford from taking his title, but someone else
seems likely to act as duke in all but name.
The duke may then have saved Blenheim Palace for posterity. But what will he
have done to the system that ensured he, and nobody else, became the 11th
duke?
The money and land at stake is substantial. Primogeniture helped the British
aristocracy remain richer, more illustrious and tightly knit than any other
comparable elite. Today, the heir-takes-all tradition still pays dividends:
a British farmer's average landholding in 1992 was over 70 hectares, more
than five times the EC average.
Between them, the 24 non-royal dukes, from Abercorn to Westminster, are
worth an estimated Pounds 4.6bn in income and assets - three-quarters of
that belonging to the Duke of Westminster. Mr Dominic Hobson, the financial
historian, says this compares with a total of Pounds 3.5bn in 1883 (at 1991
prices and only from rental income).
By contrast, continental aristocrats have become so common that their
prestige is diminished; and the parcelling of land elsewhere in Europe has
diminished estates.
In France, in particular, the post-revolutionary Code Napoleon - which
revised common law - demanded that land be divided equally between children.
While this meant that most of the peasant class owned plots of land, farms
were small and France was unable to benefit as much as Britain from new farm
machinery.
But while Britain still has its great estates, many owners are struggling to
keep them intact and in the family. Some have failed: between 1880 and 1976,
the great estates shrank in size by 76 per cent in England and Wales. Estate
duty, followed by capital transfer tax in 1975 and inheritance tax in 1986,
have forced the sale of 460 historic houses in the past 20 years.
Even when a son inherits cash - the Marquess of Cholmondeley was left Pounds
116m - it does not stop the rot. He was forced last year to sell a
Gainsborough and Holbein in lieu of tax on his father's estate.
Primogeniture, designed as it is to keep the estates intact, is destined to
continue. Lady Ann Somerset, the historian daughter of the Duke of Beaufort,
cousin to Blandford, thinks it should and will survive. 'Only really rigid
primogeniture - where the eldest gets masses and millions and the others get
not a farthing - will be rare,' she says.
'Provided the younger ones aren't cast out into the world, it's fair.
Really, the estate can't continue if it's all shared out.'
But Mr Nick Howard, of Castle Howard, a second son, predicts that the
'flexible primogeniture' will be the way of the future. 'These large estates
are businesses,' he says. 'And not all eldest sons make the best
businessmen.'

If the choice of the next president of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development was in the gift of newspaper leader writers, then
46-year-old Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, would
already have the job. First the New York Times and now The Economist have
come out strongly in favour of the man credited with knocking the Polish
economy into shape.
Given that Balcerowicz served less than three years in the political
frontline as Poland's finance minister, he may lack some political savvy
and, on paper at least, his management skills look no better than those of
the EBRD's ex-boss, Jacques Attali. That said, for a man with no obvious
public relations skills, Balcerowicz seems to be doing a jolly good job
getting his message across.

Never before has John Major, leader of Britain's least popular big political
party, spoken so frankly about his thoughts on everything from formula one
grand prix racing to Britain's female cricketing team and the rush to buy
new L-registered cars.
In happier times, the prime minister's column in yesterday's News of the
World might have been tagged a world exclusive. However this label was
reserved for fresh insights into footballer Paul Gascoigne's love life. It
is not the first time that down-at-luck Tory politicians have tried to
communicate with the masses by standing in for regular NoW columnist, Lord
Woodrow - voice of reason - Wyatt.
Indeed, Lady Thatcher once did it. But it is hard to believe that she would
have allowed her contribution to be upstaged by a tubby footballer's
reminiscences of how a 'chocolate Teddy girl tried to tempt me from my
Sheryl'. Meanwhile, Observer hopes that Norman Lamont, former chancellor of
the exchequer, will be given a chance of using the NoW to get a few things
off his chest before his old chum Lord Wyatt returns on September 5.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
History seldom repeats itself with such vengeance as it has recently for
Roger Barnes, the head of banking supervision at the Bank of England who
retires this month.
One of his earlier jobs was as secretary of the Lifeboat Committee, which
ran the rescue operation for Britain's secondary banks in the crisis of the
mid-1970s. Among the first to grab a lifeline was First National Finance
Corporation, which received support of some Pounds 350m. In recent months
Barnes has found himself repeating the exercise with FNFC, negotiating
behind the scenes to push the bank's most recent creditors to accept a
Pounds 1.1bn refinancing. But, this time, he has had the deadline of
retirement looming.
This may go some way to explaining his decision to cut through the red tape.
Indeed, one particularly obstreperous foreign creditor was amazed to receive
approval for the refinancing from head office before it had even submitted
the application. Someone had got there first.
Upon being informed of the event, Barnes is said to have thrown his hands in
the air and claimed: 'It's a miracle]'

An eerie hush has settled over the UK gas industry - quite a change from the
fierce clashes of the past between British Gas and Sir James McKinnon, its
regulator at Ofgas. A truce has been called while both sides digest the
mammoth 2,000-page Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, which was
delivered 10 days ago.
The air of studied unconcern is reinforced by the fact that Sir James has
departed for the Italian beaches, while Cedric Brown, chief executive of
British Gas, has sought out the charms of Cornwall. So anxious are all
parties to prevent leaks of this highly sensitive document that it will be
rushed into print a week tomorrow before ministers have even decided whether
to accept it.
Unusually, Observer gathers, the MMC itself will make a statement next week
explaining how it reached its conclusions. This is because there are
actually two reports, one commissioned by the DTI and one by Ofgas.
Sir James and trade secretary Michael Heseltine have agreed to exchange
theirs so they know the contents of both - which is more than can be said
for British Gas itself. Cedric Brown has only received the Ofgas report, and
he does not get the DTI one until next Monday. But he will have an inkling
of the full report because his copy contains a summary of all the MMC's
recommendations. He promises to be on hand next week to deliver his views on
the report, but Sir James will not be breaking short his holiday.
Is this because the MMC has rejected his contention that British Gas should
be split up? After battling for years against the gas monopoly, it would be
most uncharacteristic of this doughty Scotsman to be absent if the MMC had
handed him a famous victory.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Coalition horse rides into town: Japan's new leaders have a
rare opportunity to reform the character of domestic politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a deep and graceful bow, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa paid tribute to the
heavens for having chosen him as prime minister, completing a remarkable
transformation of Japanese politics. His seven-party coalition had secured
the rise of a new postwar generation of leaders, installed the first woman
speaker of parliament, and condemned the powerful Liberal Democratic party
(LDP) to the opposition benches.
These are evocative symbols of upheaval, but do they mark the beginning or
the end of political change? An indecisive and disruptive coalition reign
would invite the return of a strengthened LDP, now in opposition for the
first time in four decades.
Mr Hosokawa and his partners stand on the fringe of uncharted political
territory. They can secure the passage of electoral reforms and, as they put
it, 'reform political thinking', or be distracted by the differences
inherent in a conservative coalition that includes a Socialist party and the
political arm of a Buddhist movement, Soka Gakkai.
Political reform is the priority, but the hotchpotch of parties needs to
respond coherently to a slowing economy and trade friction with the US. The
coalition members disagree on the future of value added taxation and energy
policy, and have been haggling over cabinet positions and bickering with the
LDP over parliamentary procedure. The omens are not promising, but the
coalition still has the benefit of the doubt at home and abroad.
Financial markets, for example, have taken the coming of coalition
government calmly. Conversations and television programmes have been
animated by the prospect of the LDP in opposition, and not by a perception
that the country is on the brink of crisis. Other governments appear more
curious than concerned, sensing that foreign and trade policies will hardly
deviate from their present course.
If the coalition partners do keep their promises, there is potential for
great deviation, not so much in the detail of present policies, but in the
longer-term conduct of politics. Swapping multi-seat constituencies for
single seats and proportional representation, and controlling political
donations, will alter the electoral system, but the 'revolutionary' changes
pledged by the parties will come from increased transparency, deregulation
and accountability.
Pro-reform parties in the coalition argue that, without these changes, Japan
will be unable to develop an international profile appropriate to its
economic influence. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP power broker now in the
backroom at the Japan Renewal party (JRP), a coalition partner, suggests
that 'Japanese-style democracy' has outlived its usefulness and the country
must 'reform our politics, our economy, our society, our consciousness'.
The reputation of reform and of reformers in Japan rests with Mr Hosokawa
and Mr Tsutomu Hata, who brought down the government by defecting from the
LDP and is now the JRP leader. Echoing Mr Ozawa's lofty sentiments, Mr Hata
talks of making parliament 'a genuine forum for political debate' and
turning politicians into 'true representatives of modern Japan'.
Mr Hata is in a position to prove that his statements are more than the
puffery of an ambitious politician courting votes. He is likely to be either
foreign or finance minister in the new government. At finance, he would
preside over bureaucrats whose arbitrary use of 'administrative guidance'
gives them intimidating power over financial institutions and the interest
rates on a Japanese worker's bank account.
For example, a reform committee of Japanese and foreign banks and brokers
recently complained of unnecessary intervention by the finance ministry. It
pointed out that no new financial products could be introduced in Japan
unless they were specifically permitted; in most other markets, they could
be introduced unless specifically forbidden.
The lack of transparency in government also enables politicians to influence
the budget process in a way that benefits, for instance, the construction
industry more than the average taxpayer. As still-emerging corruption
scandals indicate, construction companies are encouraged to donate
generously to politicians in return for a contract to build a bridge or to
lay concrete on a river bed.
But corruption will not end suddenly with the rise of a pro-reform
government. When in opposition, socialist MPs were able to influence public
works contracts, directly or through the offices of well-connected LDP
officials such as Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather now on trial for
evading taxes on monies received from construction companies.
Mr Hosokawa, Mr Hata and their coalition colleagues can impose a tougher
discipline. If politicians' powers of influence over contracts are reduced,
the flow of contract-related funds will slow. The coalition wants to ban
corporate donations to politicians, but a legislative amendment alone will
encourage companies to find more creative ways of disguising illicit
funding.
The depth of political change will also depend on the maturing of the
coalition members. Theirs is a friendship destined not to last; but three
parties, the Social Democratic party, Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and the
JRP, have the potential to combine into a powerful single party, competing
with the LDP, which is still far bigger than its opponents. On the other
hand, each could remain a bit player in a fragmented system that would take
another election or more to sort out.
If the SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, is forced by coalition
membership to reverse the more extreme policies that have kept it in
opposition, it could emerge with a stronger identity than its conservative
counterparts. If not, the SDP will be in danger of splitting, with more
moderate members tempted to join the JNP or JRP and the more Marxist MPs
retreating into isolation.
The JNP and JRP have an identity problem. Their ideas outnumber their policy
details and they have yet to distinguish themselves clearly from the LDP. Ms
Yuriko Koike, a successful JNP candidate, suggested during the election
campaign the 'people don't want detail, they want change', but, come the
next election, repeated citing of the word 'reform' may not be enough to
attract voters again.
Having seen the tradition of one-party rule rejected, the LDP is beginning
to play a useful, defining role as a powerful, belligerent opposition party,
which is unusual in Japan. The selection of the relatively young Mr Yohei
Kono, 56, as party president was a response to upheaval; he has a reputation
as a reformer dating back to the mid-1970s, when he left the party in
protest during another spate of corruption scandals.
The LDP cited Mr Kono's appointment as evidence of 'generational change' and
'reform', but other executive posts were distributed among the party's
leading factions, suggesting that the old hierarchy remains influential and
time-serving politicians are still awaiting a turn as prime minister.
Mr Kono is attempting to pre-empt these challenges. After his selection,
instead of retiring to an exclusive bar for the customary whiskies and
back-slapping with factional colleagues, Mr Kono did the rounds of leading
television stations, launching his leadership and the campaign for the next
general election. That election could come at any time.
The coalition has promised to introduce political reform within a year, and
then call an election. But the seven parties have yet to agree on the
details of reform. Ironically, a dispute over where to draw the new
electoral lines could provoke a split and the fall of the government.
Japanese parties have an uncanny ability to tolerate incompatibility. The
SDP often joins with the LDP and other parties to support consensus
candidates in provincial gubernatorial elections. That past co-operation is
the basis for the present awkward coalition government and could mean that
the partnership has an unexpectedly long shelf life.
In the meantime, the coalition leaders have a chance to reform the character
of Japanese politics. If they fail, a political structure battered by the
events of the past few months could begin to return to a familiar shape,
with a dominant LDP surrounded by a band of directionless opposition
parties.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Leading Article: War and peace in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MEETINGS today in two west European cities are supposed to decide the
fate of Bosnia. In Geneva peace negotiations are to resume under EC and UN
auspices, while in Brussels the North Atlantic Council (Nato's governing
body) is to finalise plans for intervention in the war.
Is there a contradiction? Lord Owen, the EC mediator, appears to think so.
At a press conference on Friday he blamed the threat of Nato air strikes for
causing, or at least contributing to, a breakdown in the peace talks last
week. He did not spell it out, but the reasoning is clear. The proposed
peace is no longer based on any principle other than recognition of the
relative strengths of the different parties to the war. Therefore anything
that leads one side to believe its military situation may improve can only
delay the peace. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president, hoped that Nato
air strikes against the Serbs, or the threat of them, would improve his
chances in the war. Therefore he left Geneva, to put off the moment of
decision on peace.
Yet Lord Owen admits that the negotiations were already deadlocked on the
future status and division of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital; and there it
was the Serbs who hoped to improve their negotiating position through
military success. He also says that he needs air power 'in reserve to
prevent flouting' of agreements after they have been reached. It is as
though he had forgotten the sad history of his earlier 'Vance-Owen' peace
plan. A great deal of time was spent discussing the forces to be put in
place 'to prevent flouting' of that plan once it was agreed. But it never
was agreed, because the Serbs realised that so long as they did not agree to
it no force would be used, and that so long as no external force was used
their own forces could win them a more favourable settlement on the ground.
Divided city
Now the Serbs have got most of what they want, except in Sarajevo. They are
determined, it seems, to incorporate at least a substantial part of the
capital into their new ethnic state, although before the war the population
was mixed, with a Moslem majority in every municipality. They were quite
prepared to go on talking in Geneva while their artillery finished the job
of breaking the city's resistance. Thus the logic of Lord Owen's position
would lead him, in a few weeks, to put pressure on Mr Izetbegovic to accept
the partition of Sarajevo, with presumably some kind of Berlin Wall cutting
through the middle of it, while in the city itself thousands more people
would be killed in house-to-house fighting and the UN would be helping
evacuate tens of thousands of new refugees.
Use of force
For all the criticism of the Clinton administration's sometimes erratic
policy on Bosnia, it is at least trying to prevent that outcome by pressing
for the use of force. In the last few days Serb leaders have signalled a
willingness to withdraw from recently taken positions overlooking Sarajevo.
This is probably bluff or ruse, but it does suggest they take the threat of
air strikes more seriously than they admit in public - and, one might add,
more seriously than the threat deserves, given the well publicised
reservations of Nato governments with forces on the ground.
The latter's anxiety is understandable, but the assiduity of British
ministers in publicly proclaiming their fears is unpardonable. As it
happens, British forces are the least vulnerable to any Serb retaliation,
being in a sector where the main fighting is between Moslems and Croats. But
Mr John Major and Mr Malcolm Rifkind do those forces no service by
advertising their supposed vulnerability. They should simply say that
British forces have the full power of the British state behind them, and
that anyone who attacks them does so at his peril. Deterrence is more
effective if the potential adversary is kept guessing about the scale and
nature of the reprisal he should expect.
Nato's aim today should be to draw up a list of specific actions, by Serb or
other parties in Bosnia, which would provoke military reprisal. By setting
clear limits to the further use of force Nato would help, not hinder, a
peace settlement which force has already done far too much to shape.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Man and machine in harmony: Fiat is pinning its hopes on a
model launch and a showcase 'integrated' factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For three years Fiat Auto has been living for tomorrow. Beset by the woes of
the present - a plunging market share and crumbling profitability - Fiat has
been forced to break with the traditions of auto industry secrecy to trumpet
abroad its future product plans long before their launch dates.
From 1992 to 1999 Fiat Auto, the car and light commercial vehicles
subsidiary of Italy's leading industrial group, is planning to spend
L40,000bn (Dollars 25bn) mainly on capital investment and research and
development. Between 1992 and 1996 it is promising the launch of 18 models.
It has been darkest just before the dawn. Last year Fiat's automotive
operations plunged into an operating loss of L544bn after a three-year slide
from an operating profit of L2,362bn in 1989. Its share of the Italian
market, once an impregnable domestic fortress, has tumbled in only four
years from 60 per cent to a historic low last year of 44 per cent.
In 1988 and 1989 it was proudly challenging the Volkswagen group for
leadership in west Europe, as both carmakers hovered at about 15 per cent of
the new car market.
But burdened by a humdrum product range and under severe attack from foreign
rivals at home, Fiat's fortunes have waned. By last year its share of the
west European new car market had shrunk to only 11.9 per cent, while
Volkswagen had surged to 17.5 per cent. The Fiat group, which includes Alfa
Romeo and Lancia as well as Ferrari, Innocenti and Maserati, fell back to
fourth place last year as it was overtaken by both General Motors
(Opel/Vauxhall) of the US and PSA Peugeot/Citroen of France. It has lost
further ground in the first half of this year.
Virtually all of Europe's leading carmakers have been forced on to
short-time working this year in the face of a precipitous drop in demand -
new car sales fell by 17 per cent in the first six months - but Fiat was
already forced to start cutting production in late 1990. It cut 259,000
vehicles from 1991 output, 230,000 last year and 173,000 in the first six
months of this year alone.
However, it insists that the steep decline in west European car sales and
the resulting fierce financial squeeze is not yet forcing it to rein in its
capital and research and development spending - as at its arch-rival,
Volkswagen.
Now, finally, Fiat is poised for the counter-attack.
At the end of this month it will unveil in Turin its Punto small car range,
the model that will eventually replace the current Uno and will become the
most important single model in the Fiat range. The Punto alone will account
for more than 40 per cent of the group's total European sales.
The development of the Punto represents much more than just a new car for
Fiat, however, to take on rivals such as the Ford Fiesta, the Opel Corsa,
the Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra. In the dusty plains of the
mezzogiorno in the deep south of Italy, Fiat is also transforming the way
that it builds cars with the construction of Europe's most modern car plant.
The factory at Melfi, which will begin trial output of the Punto in
September and volume production in January, is the showcase demonstration
for Fiat's new theology of the 'integrated factory', which it has begun to
test out selectively at its existing plants in the past 18 months.
Melfi has all the advantages of a greenfield site, a clean drawing board and
a new workforce free of the legacy of old industrial practices. The average
age of the Melfi workforce is 26 compared with 46 at existing Fiat plants.
It promises a substantial leap in productivity to match the best Japanese
levels, and will revolutionise the way that Fiat deals with its component
suppliers.
Melfi is supposed to move car manufacturing into a new era beyond the
much-vaunted lean production of the Japanese carmakers. There is no office
building. All technical staff are being moved into the plant beside the
stamping, welding, paint and final assembly lines. Work teams are being
enlarged to include their own engineering and maintenance specialists in a
new form of factory organisation.
Melfi also represents a stark change of tack by the Italian carmaker from
its foray into the extremes of automation at its Cassino plant in the
mid-1980s, where it took the robotisation of final assembly to levels never
dared by any other carmaker.
The Cassino automation experiment was a demonstration of strength by Fiat to
the trade unions - after years of industrial strife - that robots could take
over many assembly functions from workers. The robots have danced at
Cassino, but the extreme automation has never yielded the planned-for
productivity benefits.
At Melfi the accent has changed. 'Cassino was focused on 'hard' issues,
Melfi is about 'soft' issues,' says Paolo Cantarella, Fiat Auto chief
executive. 'The integration of man and machine is different at Melfi. It is
about how to organise activities, to involve people, to train them and keep
them motivated to the job, rather than how to put the wheel on the car. We
know how to do that.'
The development of the Punto and the Melfi plant mark, too, another
watershed for Fiat in development and engineering. For the first time it has
developed a new car with a multi-functional 'platform team', drawing its own
specialists from different functions within Fiat, ranging from design and
product engineering to manufacturing engineering, purchasing, finance and
marketing.
Fiat claims that it has reduced the development time of the Punto to 36
months, thus cutting at least a year from its previous development
programmes.
The stylish and urbane Cantarella, chief executive of Fiat Auto since 1991,
chose himself to be a member of the Punto project team. 'This was the first
time we have developed a car in this way, and it was important to eliminate
operational problems from the start. I was very involved in problem-solving,
and it was vital to shorten the decision-making process. This car is most
important for our balance sheet. And I am a car guy.'
With little to boast about in the present, Cantarella prefers not to dwell
on the group's financial performance. Instead, he takes important visitors
on a tour of the Fiat styling studios, enthusiastically removing the dust
covers from the cars that are supposed to restore some of the glitter to
Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo.
Carmakers are normally allergic to revealing future products before they are
ready for launch, but Cantarella is eager to show how the future will take
shape. He reveals the large new Alfa Romeo saloon to replace the 164
probably in 1996, and already for the end of next year a new Alfa Romeo
coupe and convertible.
At the Fiat safety centre in Turin, where crash tests are performed on more
than 300 cars a year, he readily points out the wrecked prototypes of a new
Fiat Tipo for 1995 and the replacement Alfa Romeo 33 for 1994.
Cantarella has been concerned at the lack of glamour of current products,
but he is aiming to change the group's image by introducing a number of
small-volume niche products to add excitement to the main volume models,
mainly coupes and convertibles. To assemble the niche cars he is turning to
the independent Turin design houses and 'carrozzieri' or body builders.
The dearth of new product is finally ending, but it will still take another
two years before Fiat can start reaping the full benefits as production
volumes are raised.
'Fiat is a pretty efficient producer,' insists one of its leading component
suppliers. 'Its problem is not its cost-base but its model range. If it had
the models, it would be quite a force. If the Punto is successful it could
change its fortunes dramatically.'
For Fiat the moment of truth is dawning.

FT  09 AUG 93 / No more buried treasure: The economic argument is winning in
the UK coal debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is to be done with Britain's coal? There it lies underground, some 2bn
tons of it: enough to power the nation - in theory, at least - for several
hundred years. But after nearly a millennium of working, the cheap coal has
gone. The world has vast new reserves to exploit, and British coal no longer
repays the cost of digging it up. In pure economic terms, what is the case
against closing the pits tomorrow?
The point can be put another way. The world has a finite stock of
hydrocarbons. Eventually, as they start to run out, the price will rise.
That may take another century or two; but at some point, British coal will
acquire a value again. Is it not in the national interest meanwhile to leave
it where it is?
The coal industry has a standard answer to this. Even if you stop mining,
the pits cost Pounds 2m a year each to maintain. If you do not maintain
them, they collapse. In that case, if you wanted to regain access to the
coal, you would have to dig pits again from scratch, at a cost in today's
money of Pounds 400m-Pounds 500m each. Meanwhile, you are left with huge
liabilities in terms of redundancy, industrial sickness and land subsidence.
In the long run, none of this makes real economic sense. The liabilities are
a matter of historical fact: the only question is when they are to be
addressed. As for the cost of new pits, that is simply part of the
calculation. If the coal price is high enough to justify it, well and good.
If not, good again.
But hang on, says the coal lobby. If you shut the pits, you are throwing
away two kinds of asset: the coal itself, and the means of getting to it.
And in terms of the national interest, if you import coal, what about the
balance of payments?
This does not make economic sense either. If a thing costs more to obtain
than it will sell for, it is not an asset. There is quite a lot of gold and
silver underground in Britain. It stays there because it costs too much to
recover. No one suggests digging it up regardless, as a means of helping the
trade balance. Subsidising production for the sake of import substitution is
simple inefficiency.
And British coal is massively subsidised. The director-general of
electricity supply puts the amount, in the form of an artificially high coal
price, at Pounds 2.3bn over the past three years. That cost is paid by the
British public, through a higher electricity price. As a tax on business it
is a misallocation of resources. As a tax on individuals it is wickedly
regressive, since it hits hardest those who spend most time at home: the
old, the sick and the unemployed.
As for the asset value of the pits themselves, that is mostly depreciated.
Where it is not, there is still no point in throwing good money after bad.
There is an analogy to be drawn from the oil industry. Installing a platform
in the North Sea costs around Pounds 500m, the same as sinking a pit. The
oil company will carry on producing until the running costs are higher than
the value of the oil. It will then shut the platform down. This involves
environmental liabilities, just as with coal. There is also the same option
of going back for the remaining oil a century hence. The sums may be tricky:
but even if they showed the investment to have been misconceived in the
first place, no commercial oil company could convince its shareholders that
it should therefore go on running it at a loss.
It might be argued that to characterise the whole British coal industry as
uneconomic is too sweeping. Certainly, open-cast mining is profitable, and a
handful of pits might be so. In pure economic terms, there is one simple way
to find out. Let each pit operate as a separate commercial entity, competing
freely on price. The obvious risk is that short-term price-cutting could
prove so ferocious as to drive inherently viable pits out of business. But
it should not be beyond the wit of government - which still has a hand in
setting the UK coal price - to devise some kind of transitional arrangement.
Above all, the coal industry is now so small as to be in economic terms
almost irrelevant. The whole value of Britain's coal reserves at today's
price is roughly equal to a month's output of the national economy. In
turnover terms, British Coal is smaller than Bass, the UK brewer, and half
the size of J Sainsbury, the British supermarket chain. It still employs
20,000 miners, and to put them out of work would be atrocious. But these are
atrocious times. BT laid off 19,000 workers on a single Friday in July last
year.
The political dimension, of course, is something else again. The government
tried to wash its hands of the whole affair by privatising electricity, thus
aiming to expose the coal industry to the free market. But as it found to
its consternation last October, coal still strikes an atavistic chord with
the British voter. The whole of the foregoing argument is therefore in one
sense irrelevant. However much the government accepts the case, it will
proceed only timidly and by degrees.
But in another sense, it is the political argument that is irrelevant.
Production of British coal has fallen remorsely for almost 40 years, as has
the number of miners. In 1955, British Coal's staff totalled over 700,000.
It is now 44,000. In other words, over the long haul the economic logic is
winning. It is worth putting such figures in context. Between 1973 and 1990,
British coal production fell by 2.2 per cent a year on average. Across
Europe as a whole, production fell by 2.3 per cent.
The reason is obvious enough. Europe led the world in the industrial
revolution, and used coal to do it. A country like China still has massively
rich seams of coal because it is at an earlier stage of economic
development. If there is cheap coal to be had elsewhere, the industrialised
nations should count themselves fortunate.
The demise of British coal is not a sign of decline. With luck, it should be
a sign of progress.

<TEXT>
Sir, Matthew Kaminski's article, 'Feathered herds give heavyweight profits'
(July 29), talked about ostriches being 'first introduced . . . in the
mid-1980s' to the US.
In fact, ostrich farms abounded in south-west US more than 70 years or so
ago. I recall seeing several old photographs of ostrich farms in Arizona.
This is not a new phenomenon, merely an old one revived.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RAY J BEAZLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Confederation of British Industry, the retail trade and many others
use sophisticated methods for measuring the state of Britain's economy, but
we suggest the M25 motorway is a simpler test.
I, and others in this company, use the M25 regularly and there was an
obvious decrease in commercial traffic as the recession tightened its grip.
However, in the last few months we have all commented on the way the volume
of traffic is building again. Add to that the fact that, as suppliers of
industrial water-filtering equipment, we are seeing a definite spurt in
orders from customers with diverse interests, and we reckon the future is
looking good.
It would be interesting to know if others have off-beat methods of reading
the economy.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: NE and carbon emissions savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN HAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charlie Kronick's letter (August 5) is rather simplistic, both in his
exposition of nuclear costs and his remedies for greenhouse gas emissions.
To put the record straight: nuclear power is already part of the UK's policy
for reducing CO emission.
Nuclear Electric saved the emissions of around 13.5m tonnes of carbon last
year, compared with the emission level from the UK fossil fuel mix for the
same amount of electricity. If this greenhouse gas saving had been achieved
at the cost ratio indicated by the Energy Saving Trust, Pounds 1,000 per
tonne of carbon, an investment of Pounds 13.5bn would be required, half of
which would come from levies on the price of energy to the customer.
Everyone realises that the cleanest way of cutting CO levels is to use less
energy - we all can and should do what we can, and any sane person wishes to
see the EST succeed. But the realistic question is - how much is likely be
saved by all the conservation methods available? The EST has set an
objective of 2.5m tonnes of carbon by 2000. Before then, Sizewell B will be
saving 2m tonnes of carbon a year.
Meanwhile, future nuclear power can produce electricity at 3p/kWh or below,
compared with typical large tranche costs for wind power of in excess of 4p.
This is on the same capital return basis and includes allowances for all
decommissioning costs at the end of a nuclear plant's life.
As Charlie Kronick knows, most current NE provisions for decommissioning and
waste relate to previous CEGB operations of Magnox and AGRs before Nuclear
Electric's creation. It is a pity that he muddled up the Nuclear Electric
position with that of the entire industry, thus managing, unintentionally I
am sure, to double the figures for NE's liabilities. Our net asset position
is, in fact, improving, as would be expected from a growing and successful
company.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: 'Stagflation' is a real possibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MUELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It appears that the fundamental shortcoming in the argument by the 'MIT
Six' (Personal View, July 29) has not yet been pointed out. The European
Community is suffering high and permanent unemployment primarily due to
large increases over the past two decades in social benefits and the minimum
wage. This has put an above-market floor under wages, causing a labour
surplus.
Reflation accompanied by devaluation can reduce such unemployment if it
raises the level of prices and nominal incomes while the level of social
benefits and the minimum wage remains more or less fixed. But almost all
such benefits are now indexed to rise automatically with wages or prices, or
provided in kind. Therefore, reflation can reduce permanent unemployment
only if minimum wage and benefit formulae are cut or de-indexed at the same
time.
Reflation without such changes is merely a formula for 1970s-style
'stagflation' - simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: Changes, yes - but no 'demise' of The Engineer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TREVOR CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Rumours of the 'virtual demise' of The Engineer (Letters, July 28) are
not merely exaggerated - they fly in the face of the facts.
Important changes are indeed afoot at The Engineer. We are making them in
response to a change in manufacturing as industry recovers from recession,
leaner, fitter and more commercially aware than ever before.
Mr Gibson asserts in his letter that engineering is a dynamic business which
needs publications with real authority. Quite so. The Engineer has achieved
that authority by evolving to keep pace with the industry it has served
throughout its 137-year his-tory.
The latest developments to be unveiled this September are geared to help
engineers meet the challenges of today's and tomorrow's manufacturing
environment.
There will be a stronger editorial focus on manufacturing-specific,
job-useful information, particularly in feature articles. Our popular new
technology section will be joined by a highly selective new product section,
and we will reinstate a reader inquiry service.
What will not change is our emphasis on hard, interpretative news,
underlined by a new editorial design.
With this kind of investment in The Engineer, it should be easy to conclude
that we are committed to keeping the stream of information to industry
constantly on tap.

Sir, Oftel was set up to ensure competition in the telecommunications market
after the privatisation of BT. However, the result of its ruling against the
dominant company's special Sunday offer ('BT 'special offer' calls ruled
unfair', August 3) is a reduced incentive for rival operators to expand
their network, and for BT to maximise the benefit of its existing
infrastructure. Meanwhile, the consumer is denied the opportunity of BT's
competitive gestures.

In BBC Proms Live, broadcast simultaneously on BBC2 and in stereo on Radio
3, Claudio Abbado conducts the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra which he helped
to create, with players from all over the world (7.30). The first half
features Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, winner of the BBC's Cardiff
Singer of the Year competition in 1989, in Mussorgsky's 'Songs And Dances Of
Death'. The second part, starting at about 8.15, is devoted to Bruckner's
vast Fifth Symphony, lasting almost one and a half hours. What does 'ghoti'
spell? Fish: 'gh' as in enough, 'o' as in women, and 'ti' as in nation. How
can you expect any child to learn to read in a language with such
illogicalities? World In Action takes up the fraught question of what
methods should be used to teach British children to read, given that the
'progressive' approach seems, if anything, rather less effective than the
old 'a for apple, b for bed' system (8.30 ITV). In Frank Stubbs Promotes
(9.00 ITV) the spiv is trying to promote Bulgarian ice dance champions. In
Travellers' Tales Wilfred Thesiger talks about his interest in Arabian
nomads (9.00 C4).

FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: The Palace that Nash built - The architectural
delights awaiting visitors to Buckingham Palace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the doors of Buckingham Palace open to the general public for the first
time, it is a good moment to look at the architectural quality of London's
royal quarter. Visitors who stand in the inevitable queue for their
admission tickets in The Mall will find themselves on the very spot which
was, until the early years of this century, the centre of an architectural
debate about the appropriate metropolitan setting for the British monarchy.
Looking westwards down The Mall today towards the familiar balcony front of
the palace what we see is the solid, unsmiling imperial world of 1913.
King Edward VII's wish to commemorate his mother's reign led to a national
competition and public appeal in 1901 for the Queen Victoria Memorial. This
was won by Sir Aston Webb and there were sufficient funds left over for the
refronting of Buckingham Palace - a cover-up in Portland stone of the
crumbling facade that Edward Blore had designed for Queen Victoria. This
heavyweight axial arrangement at palace end of The Mall is matched by the
re-ordering carried out at the Trafalgar Square end where Sir Aston Webb
built the Admiralty Arch in 1910.
The joyous revelation that has been made possible by the opening of the
palace to the public will be the rediscovery of the world of King George IV
and his architect John Nash that still lies behind the somewhat rigid and
reserved public face of the palace. King George V appreciated Sir Aston
Webb's efforts to make the palace appear shipshape, and knighted Sir Thomas
Brock on the spot for his 13-foot high solid marble figure of Queen
Victoria, but it was the earlier King George who was responsible for
supporting the artistic and architectural achievement of Nash which can now
be shared by the public.
When the Prince Regent became King George IV at the age of 58 in 1820, there
was a sense manifested at his coronation that he represented a victorious
and thriving nation. It was felt that the effectiveness of the monarchy as a
symbol of national pride would be conveyed with more conviction if it could
be associated with a metropolitan palace of distinction. St. James's had
long been considered poverty-stricken, Kensington Place too modest, Hampton
Court and Greenwich too far away, and Carlton House too close to the street
and not grand enough for a monarch.
The nearest thing to a palace was undoubtedly Buckingham House, which King
George III had purchased in 1762 and settled upon his consort. It occupied
large grounds and had important family associations, as all George IV's
brothers and sisters had been born there. This was the house the king
decided to expand and virtually rebuild with Nash's help. There is no doubt
that King George IV and John Nash shared a vision of London as an important
and beautiful European capital. The construction of Regent Street, the
laying out of Regent's Park, and the replacement of Carlton House by the
great stucco Carlton House Terraces, are all part of this vision. The
picturesque arrangement of St. James's Park is largely the design of Nash
and it brought a particular relaxed Englishness to the palatial formality he
was to build on the site of Buckingham House.
Summer visitors to the palace will enter by a side door but will soon find
themselves in Nash's quadrangle which they will cross to enter the state
apartments through Nash's grand entrance portico. The original Nash palace
was a three-sided building open to The Mall, and roughly where the gates are
today stood the Marble Arch as a triumphal entry to the royal domain. It is
worth remembering that the architect had the restraining bones of old
Buckingham House to deal with, which had been added to but was never really
seen as a palace. Also, he was always under financial scrutiny and his
client had the reputation of letting money slip through his fingers with
remarkable ease. Despite all this Nash achieved a suite of state rooms that
is one of the architectural secrets of Europe.
Although some of their decoration has been modified the major rooms (with
the exception of the Picture Gallery) can be seen as largely Nash's
creation. The rooms with their furniture represent the final flowering of
the king's Francophile taste and reflect also the influence of Charles Long,
Lord Farnborough, who was the eminence grise behind all George IV's building
projects. What visitors will enjoy is the very high standard of
craftsmanship and sculpture in all the rooms. Nash rightly brought to the
palace the best carvers, sculptors and craftsmen he could find.
Each room is both dignified and rich: the Green Drawing Room and the Throne
Room on the courtyard side have a ceremonial distinction that sets them
apart from some of the more relaxed but equally rich rooms on the garden
side. Nash was good at smaller rooms, too, and at arranging for a sense of
theatre as visitors progress from the low-ceilinged ground floor rooms to
the grand staircase and the remarkable mirrored enfilade of the state rooms.
Originally George IV had intended Buckingham Palace to be his private London
residence while he used the refurbished state rooms of St James's Palace for
his Court functions and ceremonials. It was his buoyant enthusiasm for
Nash's new palace that brought about the decision to use it as a state
palace. It was this decision that was responsible for the immense enrichment
of the state rooms, especially the elaboration of their gilded ceilings. It
is important to remember that it is the Edwardian redecoration of Buckingham
Palace that gives it that overall air of red, white and gold. When Nash had
completed his work there was more colour, more silk on the walls and a less
institutional feel to much of the palace.
To see the state rooms today is still an immense thrill because they
represent one of the most original architectural achievements in any
European palace; they retain to a degree that particular sense of English
splendour that is both low-key and sumptuous.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: Goehr at Tanglewood - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tanglewood is the most celebrated and influential of America's numerous
summer music festivals. With its concert series and renowned summer school
for performers and composers - the Tanglewood Music Centre - it is blessed
beyond its musical distinctions with as romantic a site and mountain
prospect as can be found anywhere. Dating back to the early 1930s, the
festival has from the start been a major enterprise of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, whose then conductor, Serge Koussevitzky, created the school and
selected the architect (Eliel Saarinen) for the famous 'shed' - an enormous
radial structure, open at one end to the elements, but possessed of
remarkable acoustics - which since its 50th anniversary, in 1988, has borne
his name.
Beyond the shed's slender posts stretch immense lawns shaded by a fantasy of
lofty trees and decorated by topiary hedges, a vine trellis and a recently
installed 'analemmatic' sundial. Besides the shed, there is a
'theatre-concert hall' for recitals, student concerts and the events of the
subsidiary Festival of Contemporary Music. A new concert hall now being
built will release the theatre-concert hall for operatic productions by the
TMC. The shed seats 5,000. When the lawns are fully occupied, the total
capacity is well over 16,000, and the feeling is truly of a 'national'
occasion.
The main (orchestral) concerts take place on Friday and Saturday nights and
Sunday afternoons throughout July and August - a total of 22 appearances by
the BSO this year, in programmes making a feature of Tchaikovsky and
Rakhmaninov, respectively 100 and 50 years dead. Very much alive - nearly 61
years old - is the British composer Alexander Goehr, who is in residence the
summer long to teach the TMC composition fellows and enjoy a 'mini-festival'
of performances of half a dozen of his own works, including a repeat of the
25-minute piece Colossos or Panic, Op. 55, written to a Koussevitzky
commission for the BSO and premiered at Symphony Hall, Boston, last April.
(It was warmly welcomed on this page by Paul Griffiths.)
The Goehr context was nicely sketched in a 'Prelude' concert by the
Tanglewood Festival Chorus - his a cappella Imitations of Baudelaire (1985)
 -and the three programmes forming the first half of this year's
contemporary music festival. Composer-conductor Oliver Knussen has been in
charge of the latter for seven years, and for this his last festival he has
chosen to arrange the concerts in two 'clusters' separated by three weeks.
Treats such as Stockhausen's Gruppen for three orchestras are in store for
the end of the month.
Meanwhile we have had some sufficiently fascinating evenings. On August 1,
for instance, TMC players and conductors began with Robin Holloway's aptly
mosquitoey and stickily-irritable Summer Music (1992), proceeded to a
dynamic, high-definition Stefan Wolpe quartet (From Here On Farther, 1969),
Hanns Eisler's amazingly deft, deliciously fleet Fourteen Ways of Describing
Rain, Op. 70 (originally a film score), and a rare and tantalising bit of
Busoni (the Red Indian-inspired Song of the Spirit Dance, from 1915), before
ending with Goehr's superbly cogent and touching Little Symphony, Op. 16
(1963), in an account under Knussen's own direction that was a model of
keenness and clarity.
Goehr's fine piano trio (1966) had been played the previous night; and the
following night brought his ambitious and curious song-cycle to Frank
Kermode's elaborate cento of English poems, Sing, Ariel, Op. 51 (1990),
conducted by Knussen, its dedicatee. The work is curious not least because
the instrumental parts, or at any rate the piano and double-bass cadenzas,
tend to sound more commandingly lyrical than the mezzo-soprano (Lucy
Shelton) herself or her two soprano accomplices.
The big Goehr orchestral piece, given on a Sunday afternoon programme under
(as before) Seiji Ozawa, also struck me as curious - impressive, original,
felicitous, but not untypically evasive in sensibility and gesture. I find
it nearly impossible to relate the music to the alarming Goya image on which
it is allegedly founded.
The colossus to which the two movements do react is more likely the monster
of Musical Tradition. This is a self-proclaimed 'symphonic fragment', not a
symphony. It seeks to avoid and yet has been partially crushed by the giant
foot of the Past. Steeped in traditional rhetoric, the music nonetheless
attempts to reduce it to ridicule.
The two movements seem uncertain of their precise function while toying with
symphonic archetypes. A scherzo-and-trio form is buried in the first (and
longer) of them. The second, marked Maestoso, evokes the pulsing string
lines, the ecstatic melodic sequences of a Bruckner Adagio, but instantly
wrecks such expressivity with ironic measured clops of the celesta. There is
great beauty, though, to be found in ruins, and Ozawa's confident reading
revealed it in all its strangeness.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: Isadora's Day - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Isadora] The first name is enough, and she haunts us still. Whatever Isadora
Duncan was in her life - free soul and freed body, the inspirational dancer
of her great years or the sagging relic of the last days in Nice - she
reverberates through the artistic consciousness of our century as have few
other women. Extraordinarily, for a dancer whose legacy to us is no more
than a frayed reputation and some glorious photographic images, Isadora
still inspires, is still emulated.
So, on Wednesday, the Royal Festival Hall's jolly Ballroom Blitz season (all
kinds of dance for all kinds of people) held a Duncan Day. There were
videos, classes, a performance of dances from Gluck's Orfeo (some ascribed
to Duncan, others made in what is believed to be her style) by performers
from Moscow, Paris and London, to indicate the continuing and persistent
image of that heroic figure whom we see caught between the portals of the
Parthenon by Edward Steichen's camera.
Today Duncan's life matters less - typical of her as it was in its
enthusiasms and impracticalities - than the idea of what she did. Gordon
Craig, father of one of her children, told of the excitement of her
presence. 'She was speaking her own language . . . and she was telling to
the air the very things we longed to hear and until she came we never
dreamed we should hear; and now we heard them, and this sent us all into an
unusual state of joy.' This image of the ecstatic dancer, immeasurably
beautiful in her message, is what her public and her pupils treasured, and
it is one we treasure still.
No film exists of Duncan. We know her through legend, through myriad
drawings, through Steichen's and Steiglitz's photographs. 'Duncanism', as a
way of movement, was perpetuated after her death by pupils, but little of
what I have seen of reconstructions has persuaded me that this could inspire
artists and thrill audiences as did Duncan's every move. Probably the best
indications of Duncan's manner came from Ashton's Brahms' Waltzes for Lynn
Seymour, where dancer and dance beautifully imagined her presence; from
Vivienne Pickle's astonishing impersonation in Ken Russell's television
study; and from the joint performances of Merle Park and Mary Miller in
MacMillan's Isadora. What we sensed in these homages was the intoxication of
Duncan's movement, and its communicative grace and power.
Wednesday's dutiful exposition by dancers and pupils from the Moscow School
of Music and Movement, and the London-based Isadora Duncan Dance Group, was
something altogether more sober-sided - not a quality one would associate
with Duncan. At its best, in Orfeo's two Laments and the Dance of the
Blessed Spirits, the dance had a simplicity and a gestural clarity (arms
slowly raised, bodies held in sculptural poses) that touchingly told of
Duncan's worship of the antique. Other sequences were too innocent in means,
and what was proposed as Duncan's own dances for the Furies did no service
to her memory or to Gluck.
Yet Isadora still speaks to dancers, be it in spirit messages - which these
dances really were - or as educational example. The Duncan Dance Group
plainly reveres her example. A Moscow Duncan Academy existed until 1946.
(Duncan went to Russia in 1921 to teach the children of its new society to
dance.) The Moscow performers are from a school lately founded to provide
training inspired by Duncan's ideals. Edward Gordon Craig said that Duncan's
dancing was 'Something uttered on the divine theme'. We can do worse for the
young than show them this.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: The Basset Table - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Susanna Centlivre, who died in 1723, is having a pretty good year. After
well over a century of neglect, two of her plays have been produced on the
London fringe in the past few months and, on the evidence so far, one must
hope for more.
Ms Centlivre was one of the first women playwrights. As a contemporary of
Congreve, Farquhar and Wycherley, she had a lot to compete with. She was
also prolific in her output and one wonders now, with obvious hindsight,
whether she was perhaps the most interesting of them all. Today some of her
topical references seem obscure, but no more than in the others.
Her talent was not so much to write good plays - her plots and sub-plots are
all over the place - as to write good parts. She did so in abundance. When
The Artifice was revived at the Orange Tree in Richmond earlier this year, I
was struck by the sheer number of roles - Mr Watchitt and the Widow
Heedless, for examples - that any actor or actress would like to have
played.
Now that The Basset Table is appearing at the New End Theatre in Hampstead,
another compliment is in order: Ms Centlivre wrote some very good scenes.
Basset is a game previously unknown to me. It appears to consist simply of
wagering which card will come up closest to your own, with the odds lying
heavily in favour of the banker. It is much more primitive than (say)
pontoon and entirely devoid of skill.
At Hampstead they seem to play it with 2p pieces, no doubt as a symbol of
the shoe-string nature of the theatre. Yet precisely because the game is so
primitive, it brings out the addictive nature of the gambler, and in the
women more than the men. The specific scene at the table, where they cheat
under and over the counter, is magnificent, almost a forerunner of
subsequent Hollywood movies about other games for higher stakes.
Yet that is not all. The Basset Table contains a wonderful female character
in Valeria, whose interest in the gaming table is non-existent. Played by
Geraldine O'Connell, she is a scientist and philosopher who dissects animals
in the pursuit of knowledge about the human condition. 'Cousin,' she says to
another woman, 'I'll give you this jewel for your Italian greyhound,' which
she intends to cut up.
In a later period Valeria might have been called a blue-stocking. Ms
Centlivre, however, is much more subtle than that. Valeria is a most
attractive lady who dresses well, knows the man she wants and gets him in
the end.
It is tempting to say, and some people do say, that this was the advent of
feminism. Valeria is attacked for her interest in science not only by her
embarrassed father, but by the rest of the females. 'Ridiculous learning,'
says one. 'Ridiculous, indeed, for women,' says another. 'Philosophy suits
our sex as jackboots would do.'
My own view is that Ms Centlivre was remarkably even-handed. Some of the men
are dolts as well as some of the women; some of the men, such as Tony
Tarrats as Sir James Courtly, are also clever and generous. She gives an
overall, accurate view of society, and she does it in such a sprightly
fashion that this production by the Company of Clerks deserves a bigger
showing than the tiny Hampstead stage allows. The list of good parts (13 in
all) extends all the way down the line, notably Constance Byrne as Mrs Sago.
Between them the Orange Tree and the New End have begun a major work of
restoration.

<TEXT>
Alistair Mitchell-Innes, former chief executive of Isosceles, is becoming
non-executive director and chairman designate of Sidney Banks, the
Bedfordshire grain and agriculture specialist. The current chairman, John
Burr, who has been in the position since 1980 and is 75 years old, wants to
retire in January next year.
'We are not looking for someone to transform our debt situation because we
have not got one,' says Richard Banks, joint managing director, when asked
about Mitchell-Innes's two years at the heavily-indebted supermarket
operator Isosceles. 'Alistair has wide experience in food manufacturing and
that is the direction in which our company is moving.' He has chief
executive of Nabisco Group between 1985 and 1989.
Sidney Banks has recently acquired a rice-milling operation as well as a
company that trades in spices and coffee.
Mitchell-Innes is also deputy chairman of HP Bulmer and a non-executive
director of Next and Evans Halshaw.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels, which saw its shares suspended mid July and appointed
independent accountants to investigate ' a number of financing and reporting
issues', has changed its plans regarding the chairmanship succession.
Current chairman Richard Strong has resigned, a few months earlier than
planned, while Kleinwort Benson deputy chairman Tim Barker, who was named
chairman designate of Resort in February, will not now take up that
position, remaining as deputy chairman.
Instead, David Tonkinson, who had been deputy chairman until Barker was
appointed, now becomes chairman. In February he 'happily stood aside for
someone with as much prestige as Tim Barker' as Robert Feld, who resigned as
managing director when the shares were suspended, said at the time.
Barker explains that Tonkinson has 'got the time available'. He lives fairly
near Resort's Brighton office and is 'largely retired', Barker says.
Tonkinson is a former managing partner of the Brighton office of Grant
Thornton.

The Pounds 5m project is for Brighton Borough Council which, with grant aid
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foods, is undertaking a
broad scheme of which this is the first of three stages, to encase the
entire failing sea wall between Brighton Marina and the borough boundary at
Saltdean.
The undercliff walk, which is liable to inundation by the sea under quite
moderate storm conditions, was constructed in the 1930s by unemployed
miners. The groynes have been built up in a number of stages, of varying
grades of mass and reinforced concrete, since the 1870s.
The new reinforced mass concrete sea wall facing will incorporate a parapet
and wave return, the total encasement depth varying from 500 millimetres to
three metres thickness; the shallower having expansion joints every six
metres and those over one metre thick having joints every 18 metres.
Five new 105 metre-long groynes are to be constructed at Rottingdean to
retain a beach. The two terminal groynes will be rock.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Management: Taking quality to heart - A cultural change at
Legal &amp; General
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an idea so firmly established in the consultants' lexicon, total quality
management has recently encountered a surprising amount of flak. More than
one survey has revealed that many companies feel TQM has not delivered the
results hoped for.
Legal &amp; General, however, is not disenchanted.
Through its 'quality development' programme, the large UK life and pensions
provider says it has substantially improved its service administration, cut
its cost base and boosted its standing with the independent financial
advisers which sell its products.
Outside recognition came when Legal &amp; General won the 1992 'Administering
Total Quality' award of the Institute of Administrative Management. But the
initiative had its roots much earlier during the boom in life and pensions
products of the mid and late 1980s.
'From 1988 onwards our administrative systems were starting to creak,' says
Ray Wilkinson, manager in charge of the quality programme at L &amp; G's
administrative headquarters for high-volume individual products in Hove,
Sussex. 'With the onset of the recession it was also clear that, like our
competitors, our expense base had become too fat.'
Faced with a much tougher environment, L &amp; G established a three-pronged
strategy of which better service was one component. The other prongs were an
overhaul of product design and improved investment performance.
L &amp; G managers involved in the quality programme - which consumed 10,000
work days of training in 1992 alone - believe that efforts to make the
continuous improvement philosophy acceptable throughout the company were
important to its success.
A policy of open communication helped, including staff feedback sessions
over coffee and regular assessments by staff of their managers. Managers
cannot hide in their offices (the Hove headquarters has just three).
A questioning attitude is the heart of healthy TQM. After soliciting ideas
from employees, L &amp; G implemented 800 'projects for improvement' in 1992.
Another 2,000 'opportunities for improvement' were raised. 'These have to be
followed through, or the manager has to justify why they are not being
pursued,' Wilkinson explains.
Quality improvement teams, a 'quality council', and the development of a
common quality language were all part of L &amp; G's approach. 'It is not so
much the structure that's important,' says Wilkinson. 'It's the attitude and
willingness of people to implement it.' Regular feedback, a system of
rewards and recognition, and competitions between sections are all part of
the process.
To keep the focus on customers, L &amp; G introduced customer advisory groups -
panels of brokers and agents which meet at least every three months.
Ideas from these panels were fed last year into a document called the
'Commitment to Customer Service' which represents the centrepiece of L &amp; G's
quality programme. It lists turnround times for 38 processes - such as
policy quotation, underwriting and claims settlement - alongside the
company's results for the latest and previous quarters.
A better yardstick of progress may be a survey conducted this year by City
Research which showed that independent financial advisers rated L &amp; G number
11 out of 23 life companies in terms of head office efficiency and prompt
despatch of documents (against 16th a year ago). On existing policy service
and prompt commission payment L &amp; G improved from 18th to 10th and 16th to
9th respectively.
Robin Phipps, managing director of L &amp; G's services division, says rival
companies have been visiting Hove to learn from the L &amp; G example. He is not
concerned about unwittingly giving away secrets. 'I don't think we can be
copied that easily,' he says. 'You can mimic a product but not a culture
change like ours.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Hong Kong bridge plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first of two giant concrete towers (pictured right), which will support
the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong, has reached a height of 100 metres, eight
weeks after construction began.
When the project is completed in mid-September the concrete tower, located
on Tsing Yi, will be 190 metres - the same height as some of the modern
50-storey office buildings in Hong Kong's central district.
Work on the second 190-metre concrete tower, at the Ma Wan end of the
bridge, is expected to begin in August and be completed in three months.
The towers are being built by a process known as slipforming, which
accelerates the speed at which concrete can be poured. The forms - or
shutters - which surround the concrete move steadily upwards.
Steel trusses weighing up to 185 tonnes each will be installed to brace the
tower legs temporarily as concrete work proceeds. The trusses will
eventually be encased in reeinforced concrete and prestressed to the tower
legs.
The bridge is being built under a contract awarded last May to the
Anglo-Japanese Construction Joint Venture.

FT  09 AUG 93 / People: Talking and walking like a retailer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following an internal reorganisation designed to sharpen its retailing
skills, Post Office Counters has brought in Mike Flanagan to the new board
position of network director.
A marketing man who has worked with Gateways, BP, Lenscrafters and Wickes,
he is the only one of the six-man board who has been recruited into his
current position from outside.
Post Office Counters, which runs 20,000 post offices and hence claims to be
the largest retail network chain in Europe, has been slimming down its head
office and transferring more accountability to retail network managers.
Under the new structure, each board member also has line management
responsibilities for one or more regions, with Flanagan looking after the
South East and Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Much of Flanagan's new network job had previously been performed by an
operations director.
Flanagan, 44, says his aim is to dispel the 'feel of going into a government
office. We have 19,000 independent dealers; we need to get them to start
using the vocabulary of shopkeepers not civil servants. They have to start
talking, then walking, like retailers.'
In the last decade, Flanagan has moved about a bit. From an advertising
background, he became marketing director of Fine Fare and Gateway in the mid
1980's before moving across to BP in 1987, where he was manager of
merchandise retailing.
During his three years he set up convenience stores at several hundred
European petrol stations and sharpened up merchandising standards in others,
in Europe, the US, and South East Asia.
He was briefly managing director of Lenscrafters in the UK, but was edged
out when the company hit the recession in its home US market, and sent an
American over to run the UK side. He then became marketing and buying
director of Wickes Building Supplies, but fell out with his managing
director six months ago.
He intends to stay at the Post Office, however. 'I'd be amazed if I were not
here for the rest of the century.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / Management: Troubleshooters for hire - Companies that have
turned to outside managers for help with short-term problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT WILL we be doing five years from now? I can't imagine myself sitting
in this production job indefinitely and there are only so many places on the
board.'
Jerry Kroon, the 46-year-old executive vice-president of manufacturing at
Fokker Aircraft, was having a mid-life crisis. His confidante, Fokker's
42-year-old marketing manager, nodded gravely.
Suddenly Kroon had an idea: 'Let's start a company called Fokker Driftwood,
for all the people the company can't use in proper situations anymore. We
will hire out our services for some of the time and we'll have a ball.'
The conversation proceeded in jokey vein, yet it presented the perfect
solution to a serious problem. There are large numbers of unemployed or
dissatisfied executives with plenty of experience looking for new
challenges. Equally, there are many companies that need extra help from time
to time. Companies have slimmed down to such an extent that they
increasingly find they have no management resources to deal with anything
out of the ordinary.
The answer, as Kroon suggested, is to create a new market for 'interim
managers', employed for finite periods by companies when they are stretched
or facing particular problems.
Some big companies are setting up such markets in house. At IBM some middle
managers have been saved from early retirement and put into a special unit
of troubleshooters that are sent out on short-term assignments. Smaller
companies which cannot afford this luxury are increasingly looking to
outsiders specialising in interim management.
'Interim management? Never heard of it,' said Sir John Harvey-Jones,
speaking at a recent conference on the subject organised by Learning Curve,
the specialist training company. The remark caused much consternation among
the established interim managers and their agents attending the session.
Interim management, as these practitioners went on to explain to Sir John,
is half way between consultancy and recruitment. The interim manager is
there not just to advise, but to implement: to 'make it happen'. But unlike
permanent managers, their contribution is limited in time and during each
assignment they remain independent.
According to Martin Wood, director in charge of interim management at PA
Consulting, only one in eight large British companies has used interim
management. Most of the others either have not heard of it, like Sir John,
or have prejudices that prevent them from trying it.
One problem is the name. There is no agreement about what interim managers
should be called. They are also known as flexi-executives, portfolio
executives, handymen (after management guru Charles Handy, who advocates
flexible working patterns), temporary executives, freelance managers,
managers for hire and line consultants. In the US the terms 'head renting'
and 'executive leasing' are also common.
Whatever their name, their task is a demanding one. Some companies doubt
whether an outsider can get immediate results in an unfamiliar environment.
It is much harder to be a good interim manager than simply a good manager.
According to Wood, the ideal person is aged between 45 and 65, and has
senior board experience. They need to be over-qualified for the work in
hand, as they will probably come in late and be expected to sort things out
at once.
'They must have the skills of a good consultant, and must be able to handle
a team. They must not be politicians, but must wear their hearts on their
sleeve,' says Wood. They also need to be of independent financial means, as
they must never be dependent on any one employer, and they must not be
searching for full-time employment.
For the right person the pay is good, anything between Pounds 300 and Pounds
1,000 a day, which is two to three times the going rate for the job in hand.
There are no other employment costs, and interim managers can be dispensed
with as soon as their services are no longer wanted.
The skills of an interim manager improve with time. John Baker has been one
for six years and has been involved in putting quality programmes into three
companies. 'I learned lessons from the first, applied them in the second,
and in the third we put in BS5750 with remarkable ease, against a background
of a bunch of guys saying: 'We can't possibly do it'.'
Interim managers are to be found in an array of peculiar situations. They
have been working at Leyland DAF keeping the company going while the
receiver looked for buyers. At the long-delayed British Library, an interim
manager, who has done project directorships for the Aga Kahn, has been
brought in to hurry the project along.
Different companies use them for different reasons. Britannia Life hired an
interim manager to help absorb the acquisition of a fellow financial
services company. 'We needed a thorough review, and needed it quickly,' said
Peter Burdon, managing director. He decided not to employ a consultant
because 'they are isolated and sell solutions. They also run up all sorts of
extra costs. An interim manager is a fixed cost'.
Within days the agency identified two candidates, and the one Britannia
chose started work within a week. The experiment was a great success, and
the manager is now on the permanent staff.
Birky Plastics, a subsidiary of the Japanese group Marubeni, brought in an
interim manager while a less-experienced internal candidate was being
groomed for the job. 'We found we could involve the new man in numerous
areas of business without threatening anyone as they knew he was only there
for a short time,' said Tony Wright, chief executive.
There is potential for friction between the interim manager and the existing
staff, many of whom may suspect the outsider and begrudge his fatter
pay-packet. Some interim executives think that these problems are best dealt
with directly.
'I get the guys together and say: 'Well, I am taking this job on a contract
basis and I am in charge from now on until you are told otherwise.' With a
sufficiently menacing glare round the room, nothing more gets said about
it,' says Baker.
Others prefer the softly-softly route. 'You cannot go in there with the
assumption that you can plough through it,' says Martin Rosenhead, who has
done interim management work for large organisations including the police
and the prisons. 'You have got to persuade them that you are not
threatening, because they have been used to being threatened, and are well
trained to cope with it for a very long time.'
Yet it can all go horribly wrong. According to John Hird, chairman of the
Association of Temporary and Interim Executives, one company hired an
interim computer specialist who caused untold damage by buying the wrong
computer equipment; while another company took on a temporary finance
director who turned out to be unqualified and incompetent.
One answer, says Hird, might be to go through a reliable agency rather than
through an 'old boy' network, as the agency, which has its reputation to
defend, should have put more time into selecting the right people. However,
this route may cost more: an agency usually takes 25 to 40 per cent of the
salary. There are a growing number of agencies - such as P-E International,
PA Consulting and Albermarle - which have several hundred interim managers
on their books.
The notion of interim management will only catch on in a big way if a large
enough pool of exceptional people can be found. Good managers are rare
enough and, if good interim managers are still fewer and farther between,
the market may continue to grow slowly, no matter how persuasive its logic.

Warsaw and Moscow.
The road is a major corridor in the state of Belarus linking 11 towns with a
population catchment of nearly three million people. The M1/E30, although
designed to generous standards, is poorly maintained and managed.
Rendel, in association with the French company, BCEOM, has been appointed by
the Belarus Government and the European Community.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is acting as executing
agency.
The objective of the four-month project is to establish an effective
management and development organisation for the road.
Within this framework rehabilitation is to be undertaken and maintenance
equipment procured.

FT  09 AUG 93 / The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
THREE OF the largest composite insurers are set to be back in the black by
an impressive margin when they report their results for the first half of
1993 this week, underlining the recovery in the sector after recent losses.
General Accident, which reports tomorrow, is expected to register pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 90m to Pounds 120m (compared to a Pounds 21.2m
loss at the half-way stage last year).
The advance at Commercial Union, which reports on Wednesday, is expected to
be only slightly less strong with a rise to between Pounds 45m and Pounds
75m, compared to a loss of Pounds 18.1m the last time around.
Royal Insurance on Thursday is also expected to record profits of between
Pounds 40m and Pounds 66m compared with a Pounds 79m loss last time. Falling
losses from mortgage indemnity insurance and improving claims trends are the
main reasons for the improvement, while companies are also benefiting from
currency factors.
Meanwhile BOC's healthcare division is likely to come under the microscope
when the company announces its nine-month figures tomorrow. Observers will
want to know how much market share BOC has lost to generic competitors since
its patent for the anaesthetic, Forane, expired in the US earlier this year.
Pre-tax profits are expected to be between Pounds 262m and Pounds 275m,
against Pounds 250.5m last time, largely helped by a Pounds 23m gain on
currency movements.
Slow-growing Smith &amp; Nephew, the bandages-to-Nivea healthcare company, has
long been eclipsed by spectacular profits from drug companies. But
Thursday's interim should show investors the benefits of a low profile in
cost cutting times as the company reveals profits growth of as much as 20
per cent to Pounds 77m, helped by the fall in sterling.
Standard Chartered, which also reports on Thursday, is expected to post
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 160m and Pounds 190m, against Pounds 64m
in the first half of last year. Earnings per share are expected to rise to
between 40p and 50p, against 4.2p, because of an expected fall in the tax
charge.
When Unilever reports on its second quarter on Friday, the market will focus
on what the consumer giant says about competitive pressure. The shares have
been hit hard in recent months by worries over price wars in the US.
However, the figures themselves are likely to be reassuring, with pre-tax
profit of Pounds 545m expected for the quarter versus Pounds 511m last time.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Economics: Focus turns to UK recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION shifts to the UK this week where a rush of figures for June and
July may confirm fears that the recovery is slowing.
The data includes a regional breakdown of the Confederation of British
Industry's industrial trends inquiry, which sparked concerns that the pace
of recovery was slackening when it was published at the end of last month.
None the less, on balance economists expect unemployment to have fallen
again in July by a modest 5,000 and foresee growth in consumer lending.
Doubts about the strength of the recovery are reflected more in forecasts
for manufacturing output. The median prediction is for a month-on-month fall
of 0.6 per cent in June, although this would partly be a bounce back from
the strong May figure, when output rose 1.8 per cent on the previous month.
This is also a busy week for US statistics. The first indication of third
quarter consumer spending comes on Thursday with July retail sales figures.
These are expected to show fairly soft activity with fairly buoyant general
sales offset by lower car sales.
In France an increase in indirect taxes is expected to have raised the
annual rate of inflation to about 2.2 per cent last month compared with 1.9
per cent in June. Although inflationary pressures in France are virtually
dormant, some economists expect the markets to react badly to the higher
figure since the comparison with German inflation will look less favourable
to France.
The rest of the week's economic releases and events follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists forecasts and come from MMS
International, a financial information company.
Today: UK, June consumer credit (up Pounds 170m); July producer prices index
 -input (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 7.9 per cent on year), output (up 0.2

FT  09 AUG 93 / PSBR figure is challenged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC sector borrowing requirement may not be as big as the government
maintains, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday.
Pointing to last week's official revision of last year's balance of payments
figures which showed the current account deficit was nearly Pounds 3bn
smaller than the government originally estimated, Mr Dobson said the present
Pounds 50bn PSBR estimate might be 'artificially high'.
He said it would 'suit' ministers to overstate the scale of the public
spending problem and would 'soften up the public to accept as inevitable the
Tory attack on the welfare state'.

<TEXT>
SPENDING by Britons on holidays this year is expected to exceed Pounds 17bn,
a report from research analysts Mintel International Group says. But the
total number of holidays that will be taken will fall to an estimated 81.2m
compared with 90.4m in 1988.
The report says that nearly one in three adults did not take a holiday last
year. The recession has caused more than two in five adults to have fewer
holidays, a shorter or cheaper holiday or to cancel holiday plans.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S leadership was warned yesterday that to regard the south of England
as a no-go area for the party could cost it a majority government at the
next election.
Mr Bryan Gould, who resigned from the shadow cabinet last year over Europe,
said the party should offer the south 'something different and distinctive'.
He added: 'We must not allow ourselves to be browbeaten into accepting that
the south is somehow a no-go area for Labour or that we can break the Tory
hegemony only by trailing along on the Liberal Democrats' coat-tails.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / Review of arrest rules for deportees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Home Office confirmed yesterday that it intends to carry out a joint
review with the Metropolitan Police of procedures used in cases of
deportation that require an arrest, Robert Taylor writes. This follows the
death of Mrs Joy Gardner who collapsed as officers enforced a deportation
order.
The review will look at the specific rules that cover the behaviour of
police and immigration officers before someone is arrested for deportation.
The review is less than the full public inquiry requested by Mrs Gardner's
family. It will be carried out by senior immigration officers and a senior
officer from the Metropolitan Police.
The inquiry will investigate in particular the equipment used by the
authorities to restrain violent deportees. Mrs Gardner died after being
subdued in a struggle with officers trying to arrest her for deportation at
her flat in Hornsey, north London.
The proposed joint review is in addition to the internal investigation
already being carried out by the Home Office into the work of Scotland
Yard's deportation unit.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Company profits 'shielded from impact of downturn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES performed more robustly in the recent recession than they did in
the downturn of the early 1980s, with profitability and investment remaining
at comparatively high levels, the Bank of England says.
A report to be published tomorrow in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin says UK
companies took earlier and more active steps to adjust to the recent
recession than they did a decade ago, and therefore retained a large
proportion of the gains in profitability made in the 1980s.
The report says the return on capital in the non-North Sea sector was some 3
percentage points higher in the recent recession than it was in the previous
one. Business investment as a share of gross domestic product was also
nearly 3 percentage points higher in the early 1990s than it was in the
early 1980s.
However, the report says British companies entered the recent recession with
a much higher level of indebtedness than they had in the previous downturn.
Their borrowing requirement averaged 7.4 per cent of GDP in the five years
to 1992 compared with 2.2 per cent in the five years to 1982 - and the
effects of large financial deficits and borrowing requirements may continue
to affect company behaviour for some time.
The Bank gives three main reasons why company profitability was higher in
the early 1990s than in the early 1980s:
Productivity levels were much higher at the start of the last recession, up
by 60 per cent in the 1980s compared with only 18 per cent in the 1970s.
Manufacturers have also been more able to contain labour costs because of
the greater flexibility of the labour market in recent years.
British industry has been far more competitive in the 1990s than in the
1980s, when profit margins had to be severely squeezed. The real exchange
rate appreciated by more than 20 per cent in 1980 compared with 1989,
undermining the outlook for exports in the earlier recession.
There was far greater capacity utilisation in the last recession, helped by
stronger UK export markets and a slightly less severe cumulative fall in
domestic demand. The number of companies reporting under-utilised capacity
to the Confederation of British Industry reached an average annual peak of
69 per cent in 1992 compared with 80 per cent in 1981.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Private sector wins big share of councils' cleaning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE contractors have won more than a third of council contracts for
building cleaning, the Institute of Public Finance says today in a survey on
compulsory competitive tendering.
The institute, the research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy, found that 119 private companies had won contracts for
cleaning buildings - more than for any other council service.
They account for 35.8 per cent of all contracts awarded. However, the
private sector has been most successful in winning small contracts, and its
share of the total council market by value is lower, at 15 per cent.
But the institute says their market share should grow in the next three
years, as governors use their powers under local management of schools to
contract out cleaning on individual contracts. Most school cleaning is now
organised by local authorities in contracts which are too large for most
private contractors to win.
The private sector has steadily gained ground over the past four years.
But the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981
regulations, known as Tupe, which implement the EC Acquired Rights
Directive, could inhibit further private-sector gains. The institute says
the regulations, which in many cases oblige private contractors to employ
council workers on their original pay, terms and conditions, cause concern
because 'it is estimated that up to 90 per cent of contract-cleaning costs
are taken up by labour requirements'.
The report adds: 'With competition within the industry so intense, success
in the market is often synonymous with the lowest labour costs.'
Costs of entry into the market are low because of cheap cleaning equipment,
while there are few economies of scale, allowing small companies to bid
successfully. The institute also suggests that experience with contract
cleaning in the National Health Service has helped the smaller players.
Regional variations are marked, with the private sector accounting for 53
per cent of contracts in the south-east and 49 per cent in London, but only
6 per cent in Wales and 12 per cent in the northernmost counties of England.
Conservative councils are far more likely to award work to the private
sector than Labour authorities, where 91 per cent of cleaning contracts stay
in-house.

FT  09 AUG 93 / 'Rubber stamp' advisers win power to make their mark: How a
shadowy organisation will play a central role in the drive for more open
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGHTING yesterday's battles can be as demanding as tackling today's
difficulties, as Mr William Waldegrave, the public-service minister, has
found in his efforts to bring greater openness to government.
His insistence that 'release' rather than 'retain' should be the watchword
in dealing with government files more than 30 years old has been as alien to
the culture of secrecy in Whitehall as the greater availability of current
information held by departments.
In theory, at least, Mr Waldegrave appears to have won some victories over
the mandarins' belief that there should be no need to know.
The white paper on open government, published last month, sets out changes
to the criteria for keeping files secret which are intended to ensure that
more documents should be made available. It also sets out the basic
principle that all records should be released after 30 years unless actual
damage would be caused by their publication.
But perhaps the greatest changes are to the role of the Advisory Council on
Public Records, called a 'rubber stamp' even by some of its members.
The 16-strong council is made up largely of politicians and academics and
chaired by Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls. Its task is to
advise the Lord Chancellor about which files should remain closed for more
than 30 years. Its powers are to be extended.
First, its remit will be expanded so that officials seeking to keep files
closed within departments must seek the approval of the council. Previously
a department could bypass the council by deciding to retain a file rather
than transfer it to the Public Records Office.
There are strict rules about what categories of documents can be retained by
departments, but some council members are not convinced that they are always
kept. One noted how, when some files from the 1940s finally found their way
on to the agenda, the department said merely that they had been
'overlooked'.
The detail of the second change has yet to be finalised, but goes to the
heart of members' complaints about how they carry out their work: it will
give them access to the documents.
Mr David Sumberg, the Tory MP for Bury South who sits on the council, is
clear that it would have been untenable to continue with previous practice.
Council members were presented at their quarterly meetings with long lists
of files which, they were told, were to remain closed, and were given only
the most general explanations for their closure.
'At the end of the day, either people can be trusted to see documents and
take decisions, or they can't,' he said.
Mr Waldegrave has made clear that some way of giving the council access to
the files will be found in future, but the recent letter to council members
from the official who organises did not say how this would be done.
The most likely outcome appears to be that the council will be able to look
at files as a last resort, and that knowing this power exists will deter
officials tempted to interpret the rules in a restrictive way.
If these changes work as Mr Waldegrave intends, they will represent a
serious assault on departments' ability to keep aged information out of the
public domain.
Mr Waldegrave's officials are clear that the assault could not have been
mounted without the 'broad philosophical support' of Mr John Major, the
prime minister, and the active backing of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary.
They say that the 'open-mindedness' of Mr Hurd was crucial in putting
pressure on the Ministry of Defence, which had been seen as the department
least enthusiastic about unwrapping its past files.
And will Whitehall be defeated in any rearguard action it may try to mount
against the opening up of its past? Mr Terry Davis, MP for Birmingham Hodge
Hill and Labour's representative on the council, said: 'Ask me again in a
year's time.'

FT  09 AUG 93 / Eagle eye turned on Whitehall's secrecy: The quiet Scot
aiming to be the scourge of mandarins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY ministers and civil servants might think they can operate behind
Whitehall's veil of secrecy after the rejection of a Freedom of Information
Act in July's white paper on open government.
If so, they should check the record of Mr William Reid, the ombudsman who
will have responsibility for enforcing the new code of practice on open
government.
In pursuing complaints of maladministration against government departments
the quietly spoken Scot has already demonstrated a tenacious determination
to expose senior mandarins who hide their mistakes behind official secrecy.
Top mandarins at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are still
reeling at the strictures he recently levied against them over a complaint
about payment of compensation to farmers whose poultry flocks were
slaughtered during the 1988 salmonella-in-eggs scare. He revealed that they
had tried to keep secret information about compensation to conceal their
failure to pay adequate amounts.
'I see no difficulty in applying the same kind of regime in future in
relation to information,' Mr Reid says.
He acknowledges that much of his work on enforcing the code of practice on
open government will come from the list of exclusions. These allow
government information to be withheld from the public if, for example, it
was given in confidence or counts as advice to ministers.
'Some of the exclusions are very clear,' he says, 'but there are bound to be
some areas of doubt. I will look at the complainant's version of the
problem, look at the government department's version, and try to resolve the
difference.'
In his new task of enforcing open government Mr Reid has several strengths
developed during the 26 years since the creation of the parliamentary
commissioner for administration, or ombudsman.
First, he is an officer of parliament, with the powers of a High Court judge
to inquire into matters before him, to call for official papers and to
interview any relevant witnesses. Unlike the courts, he cannot be stopped
from reading papers by the public-interest immunity certificates issued in
the Matrix-Churchill case to withhold documents connected with government
policy over the sale of arms to Iraq.
Second, he can negotiate redress when government departments have broken the
rules. In the slaughter of poultry case, Mr Reid not only negotiated
adequate compensation for the farmer who had lodged the original complaint.
He also insisted that the agriculture ministry compensate another 120 egg
producers.
With open government he will be able to force departments to publish
information they have withheld if he believes that they should do so under
the code of practice.
Third, he publishes details of his findings in quarterly and annual reports,
to encourage good practice in government administration. The same will
happen on open government, encouraging all departments to follow the
principles he lays down in individual cases.
'I can try to change the culture of Whitehall more readily than if in a
confrontational system involving the courts,' he says.
In pursuing these tasks, the ombudsman is acting as a servant of parliament
and has the backing of a Commons select committee. If he cannot reach
agreement with a department over resolving a complaint, he reports to the
committee which can summon the officials for an explanation.
'That sanction is very, very rarely applied: the knowledge that it may be
applied concentrates the mind of the department concerned,' he says.
This greatly strengthens his hand in rooting out maladministration and
changing Civil Service practices. 'There have been examples of where my
findings of maladministration have not been accepted by a government
department. But I almost invariably find that by the time the department's
permanent secretary appears before the select committee, surprise surprise,
the redress has been given.'
It is open to ministers to issue a certificate that stops the ombudsman
publishing information on the grounds that publication would not be in the
public interest. Yet such a decision would be referred to the select
committee, an deterrent for ministers tempted to muzzle him. He says: 'I
have never been so muzzled, my predecessor was not so muzzled; his
predecessor was not so muzzled. That covers the last 13 years.'
Mr Reid is a career civil servant who served in the education department,
the Cabinet Office and the Scottish Office, where he was head of the home
and health department, rising to deputy-secretary level.
He believes that the standard of public administration in the UK is high,
but feels 'passionately' about rudeness by public servants or inattention to
people who need attention.
'Government organisations are there to help those at the bottom of the
social heap, and to help them politely and quickly. If I find that they are
not helped, their letters are ignored, their telephone calls unanswered, I
will criticise that severely. But I will equally criticise matters where
policymakers have acted in the wrong way.'
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, believes that his
cabinet colleagues may be surprised and discomfited by the powerful engine
of openness released by the white paper. If Mr Reid is true to form, he
could be right.

FT  09 AUG 93 / BR sell-off plans 'could force 15% fare rises'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL fares could rise by as much as 15 per cent next year if the government
presses ahead with its plans to privatise British Rail, the main passengers'
watchdog warned yesterday.
BR has warned the Department of Transport that splitting the rail network
into 25 regional operations in preparation for their eventual sell-off would
create extra costs requiring fare increases of up to 10 per cent.
But Mr Michael Patterson, secretary of the the Central Transport
Consultative Committee, the passengers' watchdog, said that these extra
costs were likely to be 'on top of any fare increase that BR might propose
for its own purposes'.
He said: 'BR has often made above-inflation fare increases. If the cost of
privatisation adds 10 per cent, then the total could be as much as 15 per
cent.'
Mr Patterson added: 'It is a source of considerable concern to us that the
direct consequences (of privatisation) could lead to fare increases of this
order when inflation is below 2 per cent.'
Labour yesterday demanded an urgent government statement on fare increases.
Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour frontbench transport spokesman, said privatisation
was 'a monstrous scheme which offers nothing to the travelling public except
higher fares and inconvenience'.
BR will make no decision on next year's fare increases for a further three
months, but discussion documents at the Department of Transport are
understood to warn that fares might have to rise by 5 per cent to 10 per
cent by next May, with some increases in January.
'There is a lot of difference between theoretical discussions and actual
plans,' BR said yesterday. 'But restructuring will lead to additional costs,
and those costs have to be met from some quarter.'
Critics of rail privatisation have long warned that fares could rise after
the network is sold off, but BR is warning of fare increases even before
then. The break-up of the network would lead to duplication of overheads and
other costs, with the new regional operators competing for higher shares of
funding.
The Department of Transport refused to discuss the documents yesterday but
said they were 'officials' working-group papers which would not have been
seen by ministers. They do not represent policy.'
Mr Patterson said that 'discussion documents have a habit of becoming policy
documents'. He was concerned by reports that discussion documents proposed
that competition should be introduced on key routes between different
operators by restricting the inter-availability of some tickets. Passengers
would face restrictions on some lines on travelling out with one operator
and returning with a different one, and might have to pay twice to do so.
Other proposals are that only 400 of the UK's 2,400 stations would sell
tickets for journeys throughout the UK.
Meanwhile, the passenger watchdog will announce this week that complaints
about BR services rose again last year.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Fowler seeks to protect party agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party is conducting an urgent review of ways of improving
job security for its network of constituency agents, many of whom have been
made redundant since the last general election, held in April last year.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, has written to constituency chairmen
asking to be informed beforehand if they are contemplating making an agent
redundant.
Conservative Central Office is understood to be keen to start an
early-warning system so that alternatives for saving money can first be
explored with constituency associations.
Next year's elections for councils and the European parliament have assumed
a greater than usual significance in the light of the question mark hanging
over the leadership of Mr John Major. The party can therefore ill afford too
great an exodus of agents - the permanent officials responsible for
campaigning, fund-raising and local organisation.
Central Office said yesterday that the party still had agents in the
majority of Conservative-held marginal seats. It is expected to continue to
help pay for agents in marginal seats in the run-up to general elections.
Sir Norman has emphasised in the past that redundancies among agents are to
be expected in the aftermath of general elections and that the party still
has more such officials than Labour and the Liberal Democrats combined.
In a letter to The Times last month he said the party now had more agents in
the constituencies than it did 18 months before the last general election.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Cable operator signs first BT deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NYNEX, the US-owned cable operator, is believed to be the first of the 'big
four' companies that dominate the UK's cable TV and telephone industry to
sign an interconnection deal with British Telecommunications.
According to the Financial Times's Telecom Markets newsletter, the agreement
will give Nynex, which has 20 UK franchises, 50 per cent of the gross call
revenues generated by its subscribers, against 25 per cent under its
existing agreement with Mercury.
Until now the four main cable operators - Nynex, Southwestern Bell, Telewest
and BCE of Canada - have relied exclusively on Mercury to carry
long-distance and international calls originating from their local networks.
Mercury's prices have almost invariably been lower than BT's, but BT is
believed to be competing strongly on price. The latest deal is thought
likely to lead to Mercury signing an interconnection agreement on similar
terms.
Cable operators, which have recently been reporting take-up rates of about
30 per cent for telephony in areas where networks are under construction,
are increasingly switching their own traffic on to the public network rather
than handing it over directly to Mercury.
Switching enables them to choose more freely between long-distance
operators, and to keep a higher proportion of their subscriber income. The
advantages will be greater still when new operators enter the market -
notably Energis, the telecom arm of National Grid, which is building a
long-distance network on National Grid's pylons and expects to be offering a
service from next Easter.
Nynex and other operators are likely to operate least-cost routing systems,
which allow calls to be sent along the network of the lowest-cost operator,
enabling them to take advantage of short-term movements in prices between
rival operators.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Lloyd's poised to reveal result of crucial ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON faces further possible controversy as it prepares to
disclose the results of a ballot of its 20,000-plus underwriting members
tomorrow.
Victory in the vote for rebel loss-making Names could shatter confidence at
the insurance market and wreck plans to introduce new incorporated
investors.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, conceded last month that if a motion
backing him and Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive, were defeated he
would seek a formal vote of confidence from members. This would trigger a
new battle with disgruntled Names, whose losses over the past five years
amount to more than Pounds 5.5bn.
The rebels are demanding that members be given the right to veto new
capital-raising plans. They also want new investors to help pay the losses
of Names worst affected by in future contributing a portion of profits.
In addition Names are pressing Lloyd's to concede that it owes a legal duty
of care to its underwriting members. These issues were discussed early last
month at an extraordinary general meeting called by Names.
Approval of either motion would disrupt efforts by Lloyd's to draw up rules
setting out terms on which new incorporated members could participate at the
market.
Schemes to launch investment companies or trusts by Salomon Brothers, JP
Morgan, Samuel Montagu, BZW and other banks are well advanced. Lloyd's hopes
to be able to attract as much as Pounds 500m in capital from institutions
and retail investors in time to support its underwriting next year. The
fresh money would help to shore up a capital base which has shrunk by nearly
Pounds 3bn since 1990.
Bankers stress that many difficulties must be overcome and a fresh downturn
in confidence at Lloyd's could persuade some to pull out.
One corporate financier said last week that possible investors are already
cautious because of uncertainty about their potential involvement in the
market's huge asbestosis and pollution exposures.
Lloyd's hopes it can negotiate an out-of-court settlement with hard-hit
Names but stresses that only limited funds are available.
Two panels - one examining claims involving Names on 37 syndicates, the
other investigating financial resources available - are expected to report
by late autumn and offers could be made to Names by the end of the year.

RETAILERS based in the UK dominated first-time expansion in the north-west
of continental Europe last year, research by Management Horizons, the retail
research group, has indicated, Neil Buckley writes.
UK retailers accounted for 25 per cent of deals in which retailers were
expanding into a north-western European market for the first time. Retailers
in France, the Netherlands and Switzerland each accounted for less than 15
per cent.
The UK companies included Tesco, which acquired the French supermarket chain
Catteau, and Sears, which bought the Dutch mail order operator Ter Meulen
Post.
The UK, France and Germany each accounted for 20 per cent of first-time
expansion activity in Europe as a whole.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Jordan warns of skills shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING companies face imminent skill shortages, says Mr Bill Jordan,
president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union and chairman of the
training committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering
Unions.
Mr Jordan is to meet Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, to discuss his
concern about the shortage of craft, technical and supervisory skills that
will result when demand picks up, and to present a CSEU-led policy
initiative on training.
The initiative argues for more multi-skilling in engineering and wants to
increase trade union involvement in training programmes. It recommends the
establishment of joint committees to monitor progress and liaise with
training and enterprise councils.
The initiative prepared by the CSEU includes trade union involvement in the
redesign of National Vocational Qualifications in manufacturing and
engineering - some of which it claims have been diluted in their breadth of
skills because of costs. Others, it says, are too narrow and task-specific.
The confederation, while setting out the respective responsibilities of the
government, employers and trainees, ideally would like some form of national
levy to cover the cost of the training.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Scargill takes aim at area's Pounds 5.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN by Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, to take over the Pounds 5.8m assets of the union's Yorkshire
area to ease the NUM's financial crisis has come under sharp attack from a
leading Yorkshire official.
Mr John Walsh, the area's agent and assistant general secretary, warns in an
internal document that the scheme threatens to plunge the Yorkshire area,
which is the union's largest and richest, into deficit and compel large
increases in members' contributions. He has been forbidden by other
Yorkshire officials to circulate his document.
Mr Scargill wants to centralise the NUM by taking over control of the
union's areas, which have considerable financial and administrative
autonomy. Other NUM areas are also resisting his centralising moves.
Yorkshire - like other NUM areas - is registered as a separate body with its
own accounts and assets, reflecting the NUM's federal character. Mr Scargill
was president of the Yorkshire area before he was elected to the national
presidency 12 years ago.
Yet the Yorkshire area council agreed last month to proceed with a transfer
of engagements in a move to integrate the area fully into the national
union. But such a step could be made legally only with members' approval in
a ballot. This is expected to take place before the end of the year.
Mr Scargill's plan is to create a new trust fund that would administer
Yorkshire's total spending.
A sharp decline in membership - down from 245,000 in 1982 to about 30,000
today - and the cost of the 1984-85 strike has put considerable strain on
NUM finances.
Last year the union had a small surplus of Pounds 31,686 according to
figures just submitted to the Certification Office by Mr Scargill, but
suffered a Pounds 69,772 negative cashflow on its operating expenses.
Just 32,947 members contributed Pounds 1.4m to the union fund's nationally
last year, while investment income totalled Pounds 233,615. But
headquarters' administrative costs alone accounted for Pounds 1.3m of the
union's total expenditure of Pounds 1.7m.
Priority for the proposed trust's funds would first be to honour existing
legal obligations and to pay benefits. But the other main uses of the fund
would be to cover national office expenses, additional salary costs and any
redundancy or severance money for full-time officers at national as well as
area level.
Mr Walsh estimates the fund's total income could amount to between Pounds
640,000 and Pounds 870,000 a year. He says the plan would mean raising
subscriptions and cutting benefits for Yorkshire members.
Mr Scargill has denied Mr Walsh's calculations.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Five more pits expected to attract bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIDS are likely for all five redundant British Coal pits covered by today's
deadline for applications for mining licences from private-sector companies.
The mines are among 19 pits no longer wanted by British Coal because demand
for coal has declined. They form the second tranche to be offered for
licence.
Among the first group of four pits, there was only one bid to continue
mining. That was made by RJB Mining for the mine at Easington, County
Durham. Two other pits were the subject of offers for use of the land and
facilities.
The second tranche, comprising Rossington, Markham Main, Bevercotes,
Clipstone and Betws, is considerably more attractive, and some of the five
are likely to attract rival bids for mining.
Although RJB Mining is not revealing how many pits it is going for, it has
said in the past that it is interested in Bevercotes, Clipstone, Markham
Main and Rossington.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, British Coal's former commercial director, is likely to
lead bids for Markham Main and Rossington.
Betws in south Wales is attractive because of its high-quality anthracite
coal and could attract several bidders. Ryan International is among the
companies to have examined its potential.
Some bidders face a snag - a law preventing private-sector operators from
employing more than 150 miners underground. Several proposals are thought to
involve the use of considerably more manpower.
The government is being pressed to change the law before next July when
privatisation legislation is expected to reach the statute book.
Mining companies that opt to bid for the pit licences are being asked to pay
a Pounds 50,000 bond. The other 10 pits are being advertised separately.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Deportation rules to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Home Office confirmed yesterday that it intends to carry out a joint
review with the Metropolitan police of procedures used in cases of
deportation that require an arrest. This follows the death of Joy Gardner
last Sunday.
The review will look at the specific rules that cover the behaviour of
police and immigration officers before an illegal immigrant is arrested for
deportation.
The review is less than the full public inquiry requested by Mrs Gardner's
family. It will be carried out by senior immigration officers and a senior
officer from the Metropolitan police.
The inquiry will investigate in particular the equipment used by the
authorities to restrain violent deportees. Mrs Gardner died after being
subdued in a struggle with officers trying to arrest her for deportation at
her flat in Hornsey, north London.
The proposed joint review is in addition to the internal investigation
already being carried out by the Home Office into the work of Scotland
Yard's deportation unit.
Yesterday Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, said that while she
regretted Mrs Gardner's death, she had been 'bumming on the social services
for five years'. Mrs Gorman told the BBC: 'She has cost the . . . taxpayer
an enormous amount of money. If she had gone quietly none of this would have
happened.'

<TEXT>
Mr Joshua Jeyaretnam, an opposition leader in Singapore, is to contest the
republic's first presidential election, due to be held at the end of this
month, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Jeyaretnam, a lawyer who once held senior positions in Singapore's
judiciary, became Singapore's first opposition MP in 1981.
An outspoken critic of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's former prime minister,
and the governing People's Action party, Mr Jeyaretnam has frequently been
in trouble with the Singapore authorities.
In 1985 he was convicted for improper use of his Workers party funds and
barred from contesting elections for five years. He was also struck off the
roll of lawyers.
Under Singapore's new presidential rules a three-member presidential
election committee decides on the eligibility of candidates to contest an
election. Two other leading Singapore figures have put themselves forward as
candidates - Mr Ong Teng Cheong, now deputy prime minister, and Mr Chua Kem
Yeow, a former accountant general.

Foreign workers at a Kuwait refinery went on a rampage during a strike over

reports from Kuwait.
The disturbance - unusual among Kuwait's foreign labour community - occurred
on Saturday during a one-day stoppage by about 2,000 maintenance workers at
Kuwait's Mina al-Abdullah refinery.
Their nationalities were not given but most maintenance crews are staffed by
Filipinos, Indians, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans.
The strikers complained of inappropriate living conditions, a lack of
suitable food and said annual holidays were not long enough for them to
attend to family business back home, the Al-Watan newspaper said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria will consult the senior officers in
the armed forces and police tomorrow before taking his next step over a
proposed interim government for the country.
Civilians and junior ranks in the armed forces oppose the use of the interim
government to extend military rule.
Mr Moshood Abiola, the unofficial winner of a cancelled poll held in June,
is in the US lobbying for sanctions to force the government to install him
as head of state. There seems no prospect of a post for Mr Abiola if the
interim government takes effect.
Germany, which is the largest exporter to Nigeria, last week cancelled a
visit by MPs and announced it would have to review bilateral relations with
Nigeria until the democratic process was put back on track.
Discussion by the ruling military council of the interim government
proposals ended inconclusively on Friday and will restart on Thursday after
Mr Babangida has seen security force leaders, who hold the key to Nigeria's
political future.
Pressure is coming from the lower ranks of the armed forces to withdraw from
direct military involvement in government. Many officers believe their
reputation has suffered since the government's refusal to install a
democratically elected civilian president on August 27, leaving a six-year
transition programme incomplete and the country divided by the suppression
of Mr Abiola's victory.
A meeting of middle and junior ranking officers in Lagos last week rejected
a plan by the government which seemed to make the interim government an
extension of military rule.
Even the proposal for a civilian-led interim government is being treated
with hostility in Lagos and the south-west, where the Yoruba majority feels
the north has dominated Nigeria, mostly through military regimes, for too
long.
The Campaign for Democracy, a loose association of pressure groups, is
organising a three-day stoppage aimed at 'the passive dislocation of civil
society'.
Leaflets have been distributed telling people to stay away from work but not
to resort to violent protest.
'We hope that this will build up momentum and force the government to back
down over the annulment of the June elections,' said Mr Olisa Agbakoba, one
of the campaign's organisers, yesterday. Last month a week of civilian
protest degenerated into looting and destruction, put down by the army with
about 100 civilian deaths.

MR Lorrain Osman, former chairman of Bumiputra Malaysia Finance, will be
freed later this month, almost eight years after he was arrested on charges
of fraud in connection with the collapsed Carrian group, writes Simon Davies
in Hong Kong.
The remaining 15 criminal charges against Mr Osman were dropped on Friday,
leaving the Malaysian banker to complete a one-year sentence handed out in
June. His jail term has been reduced by good behaviour and time already
spent in prison.
Carrian, a Hong Kong listed property and shipping group, collapsed in 1983
with bad debts of more than USDollars 1bn (Pounds 660m). The subsequent
legal battle has been the longest and most costly in Hong Kong's history.
Carrian's managing director, Mr George Tan, was acquitted in 1988 of
conspiracy to defraud shareholders in a decision which a leading lawyer
described as 'bizarre and irrational'. Mr Tan will face further bribery
charges next month.
In June Mr Osman pleaded guilty to charges of con-spiring to defraud
Bumiputra Malaysia Finance by authorising USDollars 292m of loans to a
company controlled by Mr Tan. The company had no assets and paid-up capital
of only HKDollars 2. The case has cost Hong Kong taxpayers more than
HKDollars 100m (Pounds 8.7m).

after four soldiers die in ambush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday condemned a Somali attack that killed four
US soldiers in Mogadishu and vowed 'appropriate action' against those
responsible.
He said the US would do everything it could to find out who was to blame but
stressed Washington would 'proceed through the UN, as our troops are there
are part of the UN.'
Mr Clinton defended the UN mission, saying it had averted mass starvation
and enabled food and medicine to reach Somalia. 'I still believe the United
Nations mission was well conceived and properly undertaken,' he said.
However, the ambush, the third in four days on troops of the UN peacekeeping
force, prompted fresh demands in Washington led by Senator Robert Dole, the
Republican leader, for a re-examination of the US role in Somalia.
The ambush resulted in the highest US death toll in a single incident since
American troops arrived in Somalia in December to safeguard relief supplies
and end the reign of warlords. Yesterday's deaths bring US fatalities to
six.
The UN said six vehicles were on their way to Mogadishu airport when one hit
a land mine and a fierce gunbattle ensued, until reinforcements arrived.
The UN special representative in Mogadishu, retired US Admiral Jonathan
Howe, blamed followers of the fugitive warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed for the
attack. Gen Aideed has been sought by the UN force since 24 Pakistani
peacekeepers were killed in an ambush in June.
'We will take appropriate action to ensure we defend our people,' Mr Howe
said.
Senator Dole told a television interviewer it was time for the
administration to reassess US participation in UN operations. Asked if the
troops should be withdrawn, he said: 'The time may be close.'
He recalled that more than 35 UN troops had been killed in Somalia and
thought that pressure on President Clinton to call an end to US
participation in the operation would increase.
Mr Dole said it was the view of other senators that the peacekeeping
operation had strayed from its original purpose of providing humanitarian
assistance.
However, Vice-President Al Gore ruled out an immediate withdrawal of US
forces. 'We have got a mission there and we are going to continue it,' he
said on television.
Mr Gore said the administration would be consulting its allies to decide on
the appropriate response to the attack.

MR Murtaza Bhutto, the exiled brother of Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's

speculation of a power struggle in the Bhutto family, writes Farhan Bokhari
in Islamabad.
The polls were called after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam

The Bhutto family has led the Pakistan People's party, the most important
opposition force, for almost 25 years. Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, the family's
matriarch and Ms Bhutto's mother, said at the weekend that Mr Bhutto would
end his 16-year exile in Damascus.
He fled Pakistan in 1977 when an army coup toppled his father, former prime
minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was later executed following a conviction
for conspiring to murder a political opponent.

ONE WORD appeared repeatedly on the lips of both German and French
politicians and central bankers last week: stability.
After last Tuesday's Franco-German summit meeting in Paris, French Economy
Minister Edmond Alphandery reaffirmed his government's commitment 'to a
monetary policy that emphasises price stability and the stability of the
external value of our currency'.
Mr Alphandery's words will have been music to German ears. For stability has
also been on the mind of German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. 'I assume,' he
told a news conference the morning after the late-night decision of Europe's
finance ministers to widen ERM bands, 'that in a relatively short time
exchange rates will stabilise not very far from where they were in the
existing bands'.
The reason for this German desire for currency stability was outlined over
the weekend by Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger in an interview with
the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In comments directed at hard-pressed
German industry, he said he did not expect a clear revaluation of the D-Mark
against other currencies in the ERM, adding that other ERM members were
currently more interested in stabilising their currencies than in cutting
their interest rates sharply and triggering devaluations.
For the French government, a period of calm, after weeks of foreign currency
storms, also has its attractions. Keeping the French franc close to its old
ERM bands against the D-Mark is the best way for Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur to fight off the charge that he has sanctioned an implicit franc
devaluation.
But for the French economy, preserving the current D-Mark-franc link no
longer seems consistent with either domestic or external stability. The
franc fort policy of fixing the franc to the D-Mark, far from preserving
'the stability of the external value' of the franc, has bequeathed an
effective 6 per cent appreciation against a trade-weighted basket of
European currencies, as the left-hand chart shows.
The reason is that the French franc has been pegged to an appreciating
currency. Until last September's crisis, the ERM successfully suppressed the
D-Mark appreciation which German unification demanded. Instead, the real
appreciation of the German currency, necessary to reorientate west German
production from exports to east Germany and allow the government to finance
its budget deficit, occurred through a rise in German inflation relative to
its European partners.
The result was a steady decline in the European price competitiveness of
German industry since 1991, as the right-hand chart shows. France, by
contrast, continued to amass competitiveness gains because of its relatively
low producer price inflation rate.
Since September the departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the
system and the devaluations of the punt, peseta and escudo have further
undermined German competitiveness, this time through a nominal D-Mark
appreciation. But France, by sticking to its old ERM parity, has been forced
to accept both this nominal exchange rate appreciation and the Bundesbank's
high interest rates.
The result is a deepening and unnecessary French recession. Maintaining the
franc fort policy, far from preserving domestic stability, has thus
progressively deepened France's domestic deflation. The longer the
government refuses to cut its short-term interest rates in an attempt to
preserve this franc appreciation, the deeper the damage to industry and the
greater the risk of an unnecessarily large franc depreciation and
inflationary backlash when the policy collapses.
For France, a sizeable cut in interest rates, accompanied by some form of
franc depreciation, seems the only route back to stability. German
industrialists have good reason to hope that such a franc depreciation does
not occur over the coming months. But if the franc does fall, they should
address their complaints to Bonn and Frankfurt, not Paris.

CHINA could slow inflation to an annual 10.5 per cent, according to a senior
government analyst.
Mr Lai Guangxian, director of the economic forecasting department of
Beijing's state information centre, said the rate depended on the
effectiveness of the government's current macro-economic control measures.
Mr Lai, quoted in Sunday's official Business Weekly newspaper, said China's
total annual money supply could be kept to about Yn150bn (Pounds 17.4bn).
Money supply in the first half, according to government figures, was
Yn52.8bn and growing at an annual rate of 50 per cent.
Control of fixed assets investment - which grew by an annual rate of 61 per
cent in the first half - was especially important, Mr Lai said.
'The slowdown in inflation could be achieved by controlling the country's
total investment in fixed assets to a growth rate of about 28 per cent and
limiting total retail sales growth to about 18 per cent for the year,' the
Business Weekly said. First-half retail sales increased 21.6 per cent on the
same period last year.
Figures released last month by the state statistical bureau show China's
economy grew in the first half by an annual rate of 13.9 per cent, more than
a full percentage point higher than the 12.8 per cent recorded for 1992.
Inflation was shown to be running at a year-on-year 14 per cent nationally,
but 21.6 per cent in 35 big cities.
Investment in fixed assets shot up to Yn354.2bn, with investment by the
state sector growing by 70.7 per cent, to Yn219bn.
In June the government began implementing austerity measures aimed at
cooling the economy, which has been compared by both local and international
observers to a runaway train. The measures have so far included directives
to specialised banks to recall all high-risk loans, stop lending to
non-banking financial institutions and stop running commercial companies.
Bank lending and deposit rates have been increased with the aim of boosting
faith in banks and to stabilise domestic prices.
The official People's Daily said Beijing's call to strengthen control over
economic growth rates had yielded 'preliminary results in certain areas'.
But in a separate, strongly worded commentary, the Communist party said
local officials must obey new policies and stop trying to shield their
regions from the go-slow order.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Belarus seeks currency union with Russia
</HEADLINE>

BELARUS, having seen its surrogate currency tumble after the Russian central
bank's withdrawal of pre-1993 banknotes, is now trying to tie its economic
survival to a new currency union with Russia.
The value of coupons issued last year in Belarus to make up for a shortage
of rouble banknotes from Russia has fallen 25 per cent in the past two
weeks.
While roubles traded in Moscow have remained at about Rbs1,000 to the
dollar, the coupon, called the hare because of the animal shown on the
makeshift banknote, was fetching the equivalent of Rbs1,550 to Dollars 1 on
Friday.
The weakening of the hare also means that Belarus has to pay more for
Russian goods and effectively earns less from its exports to Russia - a
body-blow in that most Belarus trade is with its giant neighbour. The
exchange rate between the Russian rouble and the Belarus rouble had risen
from 1:1.8 on July 24 to 1:2.6 on Friday.
Unlike other former Soviet republics enraged by the Russian central bank's
withdrawal of notes, the Belarusian government, always respectful towards
Moscow in public, appears to accept the central bank move.
The reformist chairman of the Belarus parliament, Mr Stanislav Shushkevich,
who is also head of state, insisted in an interview that the step had done
'no great damage'. Instead of introducing its own fully fledged currency, as
some republics, such as Turkmenistan, plan to do, Belarus would keep the
rouble on conditions to be agreed with Moscow, he said.
Similar undertakings were made at the weekend by Kazakhstan, the second
largest former Soviet republic, and Uzbekistan, the most populous of the
Central Asian republics.
Central Asian leaders, meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow at
the weekend, called for a meeting on September 7 of all republics keen to
build an economic union.
Russia has long demanded that republics abandon the rouble as their currency
or subscribe to common budgetary, financial and monetary policies dictated
by Moscow. The central bank move appears to have helped speed their
decision.
'We are ready to establish common credit and bank policies, a common tax
policy and to set aside all Customs duties,' Mr Shushkevich said.
A small country of 10.7m people, which made up just 4 per cent of GDP of the
former Soviet Union in 1992, Belarus has staked much political capital on
rebuilding economic ties with the rest of the ex-Soviet Union.
Staying in a newly recreated rouble zone, government officials hope, might
stem the drop in inter-republican trade, down by 40 per cent since 1991.
About 70 per cent of imports, including 90 per cent of energy supplies, come
from Russia. 'If our relations remained the same as before, the economy
would be better,' said Mr Vladimir Khilko, chairman of the Belarus Savings
Bank.
To that end, even before the central bank move, Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the
prime minister and a conservative, last month agreed to work on an economic
union with Russia and Ukraine, due to be signed next month. Mr Kebich and Mr
Shushkevich, political opponents, see eye-to-eye on economic union - though
Mr Shushkevich, against a majority in parliament, opposes a collective
security agreement with Russia.

<TEXT>
MR LEONID Kuchma, Ukrainian prime minister, at the weekend gave his most
serious warning so far on the economy, saying it faced a 'catastrophe',
Russia having stopped supplying oil because of arrears on the hard currency
payments now required.
Mr Kuchma was trying to tackle the immediate oil problem by telephone calls
to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister.
But the Ukrainian premier said that, in the long run, the only prescription
for Ukraine's economic ills was 'a very radical reform programme' which the
government would unveil early next month.
According to Mr Daniel Kaufmann, head of the World Bank mission in Ukraine,
the country's crisis is created by 'the combination of two factors - Ukraine
is the first country in eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union to cross
the threshold into hyper-inflation, and it is in the midst of an
overwhelming balance of payments crisis.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE crisis of the Russian economy will continue well into next year, but
economic recovery can be expected in 1996, according to the government's
latest blueprint for market reform.
This medium-term programme, approved on Friday, also claims to have digested
last year's lessons, including the need for more social cushioning, more
action against inflation, and selective rather than across-the-board support
for industry. It lists unchanged strategic aims, such as land reform, and
sets out essential institutional changes, such as the creation of an
effective secondary share market.
The programme expects the economy to begin stabilising in the second half of
1994, saying that the completion of mass privatisation by then will have
improved company performance. It hopes for inflation to fall to 5-7 per cent
a month next year, compared to 19 per cent last month. By the end of 1995,
it expects the equivalent of 35 per cent of gross domestic product to be in
state hands.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Palestinian leaders may quit talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A CRISIS simmering among Palestinian leaders boiled over yesterday as three
senior leaders flew to Tunis to tender their resignations from the Middle
East peace talks delegation.
The move, which would threaten the flagging Arab-Israeli peace process,
revealed old divisions between Palestinian leaders inside the
Israeli-occupied territories and the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation
Organisation led by Mr Yassir Arafat.
It also exposed deep frustration about the lack of progress in the peace
process after the visit to the region last week by Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, and the increasing desire of Palestinians in the
occupied territories for greater democracy inside PLO decision-making
bodies.
In Israel, the move re-ignited debate on whether the government should open
direct official contacts with the PLO - one of Israel's greatest taboos but
recently under review.
Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, chief Palestinian negotiator, said the three top
leaders - Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat - were
going to hand their resignations to Mr Arafat because of differences with
the PLO leaders on how best to conduct talks with Israel. But the PLO would
probably turn the resignations down, he added.
During a transit stop in Amman, Mrs Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman,
refused to confirm the resignation threat but said there were 'serious
internal Palestinian issues' that had to be discussed 'frankly' in Tunis.
Reflecting reports that the three leaders are upset about lack of
consultation by Mr Arafat over recent positions presented to the US, Mrs
Ashrawi said: 'There is a two-way street of consultations and discussions.'
Mr Ziad Abu Ziad, a consultant to the Palestinian delegation, said the
latest rift occurred over a PLO-drafted response to Mr Christopher's
suggestions for an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. The Palestinian
delegation in Jerusalem rejected the document and were upset that the
PLO-draft had been put to Mr Christopher in Egypt before they were
consulted.
Even so, much deeper problems lie behind the latest issue. Palestinian
leaders in the occupied territories have said recently that their ability to
negotiate with Israel has been completely restricted by Mr Arafat, who
remains the dominant decider.
They accuse Mr Arafat of pursuing a strategy of remaining in the peace
process without allowing substantial progress because such progress could
lead to the development of alternative Palestinian leadership in the
occupied territories during interim self-rule and thus could marginalise the
PLO-Tunis. Mr Arafat, they say, wants to show Israel and the US that there
can be no settlement without the direct involvement of the PLO-Tunis. This
strategy leaves the Palestinian negotiators vulnerable to criticism by
Palestinians who are increasingly angry about the lack of progress and
Israel's continued abuse of human rights.
All the Palestinians are united in calling for direct PLO involvement in the
talks - this being opposed, so far, by Israel and Washington. Some Israeli
politicians feel that the PLO-Tunis is more moderate and coherent than
Palestinians in the occupied-territories, and that the PLO should be brought
into the talks.
Last week, it was revealed that Mr Yossi Sarid, the left-wing environment
minister, became the first Israeli cabinet minister publicly acknowledged to
have met PLO officials. Yesterday, Mr Sarid said: 'Palestinian negotiators
are in an impossible position. When they stop, they are urged by Tunis to go
ahead; when they go ahead, sticks are shoved between their wheels. Hence. .
. we must talk to the PLO in Tunis.'

RUSSIA and the Central Asian republics have appealed to the UN to mediate,
and to send observers to the Tajik-Afghan border, in an attempt to end
Afghan attacks on a strategic border of the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
At a weekend summit to discuss the Tajik crisis, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin failed to extract specific commitments from his Central Asian
partners for a joint peace-keeping force. So far, the brunt of peace-keeping
has been carried by the Russian army, with help from Uzbekistan and a single
battalion from Kyrgyzstan.
The president of Turkmenistan, which plans to operate alone economically and
politically by relying on vast reserves of natural gas, did not attend the
meeting. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan endorsed, with
Russia, a vague statement that they would respond appropriately if attacks
were to continue, and that Tajikistan would receive more military and
humanitarian assistance.
The foreign ministers of the five countries appealed to Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, for mediation to pave the way for talks with
Afghanistan. They also asked the UN Security Council to send observers to
the border and to examine urgently a crisis combining attacks from
Afghanistan and civil war in Tajikistan.
Meanwhile, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the leader of Georgia, another war-torn
republic south of Russia, found himself the sole master of the local
combination of economic mess and civil war, his cabinet having been forced
out of office by parliament on Friday. Mr Shevardnadze, adding the
premiership to his already dominant role as head of state, claimed Georgia
faced extinction unless emergency powers were concentrated in his hands.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Budget is 'all about paying for the 1980s': The debate over
the economic effects on the real world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRILLION dollars would equal a stack of Dollars 1,000 bills 67 miles high.
That is what Ronald Reagan told Congress in February 1981, when the US
national debt was edging up to this thousand billion level but was still a
meagre Dollars 934bn (Pounds 627bn).
Twelve years later the national debt is Dollars 4.3 trillion - and the stack
of Dollars 1,000 bills is 288 miles high. Clearly, something went very
wrong. But, as if indifferent to this dismal track record, politicians did
not refrain last week from confidently issuing either forecasts of disaster
or extravagant claims of achievement if the Clinton economic plan - the
latest solution to massive US budget deficits - was enacted.
President Reagan's recipe to boost the economy was to cut personal income
tax rates by 10 percentage points over three years and give tax breaks to
business as well.
This time the Republicans said the Clinton budget package would smash the
prospects for 800,000 small businesses, cost jobs and retard the recovery.
Democrats said it would cut the deficit by Dollars 500bn over five years,
turn the country around, end the 'gridlock' in Congress and create 8m jobs.
Among the budget's 15 pounds of pages (according to one congressman, who
presumably brought a scale to his office) are thousands of provisions whose
effects were vigorously debated.
'As surely as night follows day, these proposals provide those who save the
most with the incentive to save less,' declared Congressman Rick Lazio, a
New York Republican. 'With productivity finally on the move, these tax
changes provide the incentive to work less or not as hard.'
In Texas alone, the new taxes will cut 41,000 jobs, said Congressman Jack
Fields, another Republican. The legislation would provide Dollars 3 in tax
rises and fees for every Dollars 1 in 'promised future spending cuts'.
Congressman James Moran, a Virginia Democrat, had a different view. The
legislation would reduce real estate taxes, encourage debt restructuring,
authorise mortgage revenue bonds and low income housing tax credits. It
would 'break the back of the credit crunch that is strangling this economy
and reduce the number of properties that have to be seized by failed banks'.
Meanwhile, economists in the real world were watching the 'theatre of the
absurd', as one called the congressional show this week. Most said the
impact of the legislation on the US economy would be slightly negative in
the short run, modestly positive over the long term and possibly negligible
overall.
Economists believed it contained little economic stimulus although the
Dollars 21bn to be returned to the 'working poor' in earned income tax
credits might boost some additional spending.
However, Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the investment fund group
Dreyfus, is worried about the impact of the budget on consumer spending
habits of the well-off. He said: 'I think it's a depressant on the consumer
area - what you have is a permanent income tax increase on the
higher-spending portion of the population.'
He believes higher taxes will crimp consumer demand, which will 'keep the US
economy in a restrained expansion mode'.
Mr Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities agrees that President Clinton is wrong
to have targeted high-income individuals for tax increases. 'He's taking too
much money away from people who aren't as rich as he thinks. . . The economy
is weak and it's going to hurt.'
Many economists initially were disappointed that the president did not seek
a larger budget reduction package. But upon seeing the 'absurd spectacle' in
Congress, they began to think that Mr Clinton had done the best he could.
Mr Bruce Steinberg, a manager at Merrill Lynch, said a tax payment of this
scale in the economic package - about Dollars 240bn - would usually tend to
slow the economy. But more than half the fiscal drag would be offset by
interests rates lower than they would be without deficit reduction.
'The effect is at most 0.5 per cent of GDP, most likely only 0.1 or 0.2 per
cent,' he said.
The tax package might hurt some small businessmen, whose tax rates could
rise from 31 to 36 per cent if they earn more than Dollars 200,000 a year.
But 'a lot of these guys are doctors, lawyers and accountants' who do not
hire many workers in any case, Mr Steinberg said.
Mr Barry Bosworth, an economist with Brookings Institution said there would
be 'very small' depressive effect in the short run.
However, a smaller deficit means less government borrowing and higher
savings and capital formation for the private sector. Much of the corporate
finance restructuring is over, but corporations still are not borrowing
much, which is one reason for the lower long-term interest rates.
Mr William Griggs, a former Treasury official, agreed with Republicans who
wanted to stress budget cuts over new taxes which probably would not produce
the revenue the president expected. However, 'the depressing effects of this
have been overdone,' he said. 'We will get a rise in confidence from having
it passed and most taxpayers will find they have almost no tax increase.'
The consensus is that job creation may move more slowly than without the new
taxes, but the 2m jobs that Mr Clinton promised in the election will still
be created this year, and labour force growth has slowed.
The budget deficit had to be attacked at some point. 'It's all about paying
for the 1980s,' said Mr Griggs.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Fine day for Virgin in Paris: Megastore open despite FFr1m
Sunday trading penalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VIRGIN, the British leisure group, yesterday again defied the French
authorities by opening its opulent megastore on the Champs Elysees in Paris,
even though it meant paying a legal fine of FFr1m (Pounds 114,000).
Mr Patrick Zelnick, the flamboyant chairman of Virgin in France who has led
the two-year battle against France's Sunday trading ban, described
yesterday's opening as 'a bit like a last stand'. The shop opened as usual
at noon with a banner emblazoned across its facade saying 'In the name of
Sunday we'll fight to the end.'
Virgin said, however, that it would decide this week whether to open next
Sunday.
The latest bout of the Sunday trading battle began last month when the CGT
trade union won a court order to force Virgin to close on Sundays. It has
continued to trade despite the ban and on Friday won an appeal to reduce its
fine from FFr4m to FFr1m.
'It's obvious that we can't carry on paying such huge penalties,' said Mr
Zelnick, who throughout the Sunday campaign has shown the same flair for
attracting media attention as Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's founder. 'But
we're still opening the store today to show how stupid the situation has
become.'
The Champs Elysees megastore, set in a lavishly renovated banking hall,
usually attracts 30,000 customers and generates a fifth of its weekly sales
on Sundays. The timing of the current skirmish could scarcely be better for
Virgin, which would otherwise have expected to see business slow down in
August, a holiday month in France.
'This is the first time I've been here,' said Ms Severine Hinault, 22, a
student from the Paris suburbs. 'I didn't even realise Virgin was open on
Sundays until I saw the television coverage of the campaign. The store
looked so great that I had to come.'
'I'm here to show my support for Virgin,' said Mr Guillaume Rochard, a
23-year-old office worker. 'I often come on Sundays to spend a couple of
hours in the store. I work all week so I don't have time to shop. Why
shouldn't Virgin open on Sundays? It isn't doing any harm.'
The shop has set up a special counter where Mr Rochard can sign a petition
in support of its campaign. Mr Branson has said 450,000 people have signed
so far. Virgin also sells campaign T-shirts - bearing the slogan 'I vote yes
to the Virgin megastore opening on Sunday' - for FFr44 each.
Virgin has stepped up its lobby to persuade the government to reform the
1906 Sunday trading laws. Mr Branson last week threatened to scrap his plans
for expansion in France, which could involve creating 1,000 jobs in five
years by opening 25 new shops.
The government has been split over the Virgin battle. Mr Jacques Toubon,
arts minister, has argued that Virgin should be exempted from the Sunday
ban. Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister and the chief target of the union
protest, has urged Virgin to respect the law but promised that parliament
will debate the 1906 legislation this autumn.

FT  09 AUG 93 / VW steers cautiously through a minefield

<TEXT>
A MONTH or more after joining Volkswagen, former General Motors managers
were still working diligently on their old employer's behalf.
Shredding documents is not the sort of work automotive purchasing and
production men are used to, but they got on with the job.
According to Volkswagen, they took pains to ensure that documents which
could 'possibly' belong to GM and could 'possibly' contain sensitive
information were destroyed. Their aim was to 'avoid any danger' that the
information should fall into VW hands - in other words they were working in
the interests of their ex-employer, General Motors.
Eye-witnesses said two of the group, Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario
Piazza, worked through one night in April, filling a van parked outside a
Wiesbaden house 'metres-high' with bags of confetti.
According to VW, others carried out their shredding in the Gastehaus
Rotehof, a comfortable Wolfsburg hostelry owned by Volkswagen and used
customarily for entertaining distinguished visitors. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, newly appointed production director and ex-GM global buying
chief, for example, stayed there while house-hunting.
In one 30-line statement, issued close to midnight on Friday, Volkswagen
effectively put paid to its new employees' persistent claims that none of
them took any documents when they left GM and Adam Opel, the US group's
German subsidiary last March. Since GM papers are now admitted to have been
in the hands of VW employees on VW property, it may make it more difficult
for the German group to sustain claims that no secrets made their way to the
Volkswagen headquarters at Wolfsburg.
Opel said yesterday that the weekend's admissions - notably on the Rotehof
shredding activities - would be of particular significance to public
prosecutors investigating suspicions of industrial espionage against Mr
Lopez and three associates.
The bizarre statement, which emerged after a meeting of the German group's
supervisory board, was otherwise much as expected. The board, which hires,
fires and ensures the decent conduct of executives, restated 'unaltered
confidence' in Mr Lopez and in chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech's claim that the
group would break even this year.
As befits a case in which disappearing acts have so far been everyday
occurrences, there was much missing from the board's declaration. There was,
for instance, no mention of the shredders' names and no explanation of how
or why the papers were taken or sent to Wolfsburg.
But something else was missing. Although the statement reiterated its
support for Mr Lopez, there was no mention of a declaration two weeks ago in
which an elite group of senior supervisory directors said they would stand
by him unless and until he was found guilty.
Volkswagen is hanging on to its miracle-worker, but its grip appears to have
loosened. But as in the past, the group refrained from offering any explicit
support for his colleagues. Indeed, the shredding revelations suggested more
than ever that Mr Lopez's associates have been cut adrift.

FT  09 AUG 93 / White House starts to ponder price of victory: With his
budget bill narrowly passed at last, the president can sigh with relief and
look to the future
</HEADLINE>

NO ISSUE was more central to Bill Clinton's campaign to become president of
the US than the management of the economy, and nothing contributed more to
the defeat of George Bush last November.
It is against that background that Thursday night's cliff-hanging vote in
the House of Representatives on President Clinton's deficit-reduction budget
bill, and the scarcely less dramatic vote in the Senate the following day,
have to be seen. To have lost those votes, despite a Democrat majority in
both houses, would not just have struck at the core of Mr Clinton's
legislative programme, but would have also raised the most serious doubts
about his ability to work successfully with Congress.
The wave of relief that swept through the White House shortly after 10pm on
Friday, when the Senate finally gave Mr Clinton his bill after a week of
frantic lobbying, was therefore all too understandable. A victory was all
that mattered, even though in the event it was by just two votes in the
House of Representatives and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Al Gore
in the Senate.
How large a political price Mr Clinton had to pay for that victory, both in
the country at large and on Capitol Hill in particular, and the lessons he
had gleaned from it, are likely to have a decisive bearing on the remainder
of his presidency.
The learning curve for the relatively young Mr Clinton and his staff at the
White House was always likely to be a sharp one, and at the weekend the
debate was already well under way about how the presentation and compromises
struck on the budget legislation could have been better handled. Somewhere
in the course of the past five months, it is clear that the White House lost
its ability to define the budget as offering a stimulus which would create
jobs, and allowed the Republicans to present it instead as essentially a
tax-raising exercise which would hit the living standards of middle-income
Americans.
In part that was because Mr Clinton had to sacrifice important parts of the
original bill. It did become essentially a budget-deficit reduction
exercise, something that was not easy to sell politically, not least because
the impact of the revenue-raising measures was felt immediately  - even
retroactively in the case of some income-tax increases - while the bulk of
the cost-cutting will not occur until later in Mr Clinton's term.
But he also failed fully to get across the message that the tax changes,
apart from the increase in gasoline tax, fell predominantly on the
wealthiest and that there were positive benefits for many Americans on lower
incomes. The repeated if unfair assertion by Republicans led by Mr Bob Dole,
the Senate minority leader, that this was the biggest tax increase in US
history, hit home. As public opinion polls demonstrated last week, Mr
Clinton was never able to undo the damage.
Neither was the president able to demonstrate that he enjoyed the full
support of the party he leads. Long-time observers of Congress assert that
rarely before has there been such a collection of individualists on Capitol
Hill who so readily put personal and local interests ahead of those of
country and party. Add to that the loss of ability that modern presidents
are said to suffer in enforcing party discipline, and Mr Clinton's problems
last week become clearer. Faced by unanimous Republican opposition in both
houses, all his lobbying time was consumed in attempting to whip
recalcitrant Democrats into line.
For the optimists, the worst is now over. They argued yesterday that the
budget bill was always likely to be the hardest piece of legislation to
force through Congress, simply because it broke new ground by reversing the
trend of the past 12 years. Even if its effect on the economy will be much
less beneficial that its proponents would have the public believe, a start
has been made. This in turn opens the door for the other key parts of the
Clinton programme, such as the overhaul of the health care, changes to the
welfare system, the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement and
Mr Gore's proposals for 're-inventing government', all of which are capable
of attracting greater bipartisan support than was achieved during the budget
debate. Mr Dole has already stressed that Republicans want to be 'part of
the action'.
Democrats are cheered by indications that a number of Republicans are
attracted by aspects of the work being done by the team headed by Ms Hillary
Rodham Clinton on health care, although once again the critical issue will
be on how the reforms are to be paid for. Republican leaders said yesterday
they hoped that the administration had learned its lesson during the budget
battle and now understood that the public would not tolerate any further tax
increases.
Certainly, Mr Clinton once again has everything to play for. His political
standing in the country may not have been much enhanced by his budget
victory, but neither has it been seriously tarnished. One thing has
assuredly not changed. He will continue to be judged fundamentally on the
performance of the economy. Mr Clinton was elected to turn it around, and
will sink politically if he fails.

CONGRESSIONAL approval of President Bill Clinton's economic plan is unlikely
to provoke much reaction from investors when US financial markets open
today. The budget measures have been debated for several months, and their
impact on the economy has already been priced into both bonds and stocks.
In some quarters of industry, the 11th-hour haggling over the package
produced noticeable sighs of relief. The General Aviation Manufacturers
Association, which represents makers of small aircraft and corporate jets,
described the proposed repeal of the luxury tax as good news.
'That has been a deterrent, especially to those buyers who use an aircraft
partly for business and partly for their own use,' said GAMA. The trade
association also breathed more easily when it learnt that new registration
fees would not be imposed on aircraft, and welcomed the much smaller than
threatened 4.3 cents a gallon petrol tax. 'That's not going to kill us,' it
commented.
The National Marine Manufacturers Association was equally encouraged, and
glad to see that the tax on luxury items priced at above Dollars 100,000
(Pounds 67,000) died.
A spokesman said: 'The tax cost about 25,000 to 30,000 people their jobs on
boat lines. It decimated sales of the product, which fell about 70 to 80 per
cent. So its demise is good news for boating and for the big boat sector
particularly.'
Other industry groups were critical of some of the concessions made. The
beleaguered commercial airline industry said that it remained adamantly
opposed to the imposition of increased taxes on jet fuel - despite the fact
that these duties will not now come into effect until October 1995.
'We're continuing to oppose the fuel tax on airlines,' said the Air
Transport Association, which represents the main US carriers. 'The two-year
exemption is not really the point. . . we think we make our fair
contribution already.'
Mr Eric Johnson of the Northeastern Loggers Association also criticised some
of the last-minute haggling, in which senators won concessions for special
interest groups, in exchange for supporting the package. 'I'm afraid the
president compromised a bit too much and that may come back to haunt him,'
he said.
Meanwhile, Monsanto, the big US chemical company, expressed its displeasure
over a 90-day moratorium on the sale of bovine growth hormone - a measure
designed to appease Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who had
pushed for a one-year delay. The moratorium will start after the Food and
Drug Administration approves the drug, expected later this year.
'Even if it had come down to a one-day moratorium we would have thought it
was wrong,' said Monsanto. 'It violates having a scientific-based regulatory
process. There is no reason and no justification for it and we believe that
most members of Congress feel that way as well.'

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton made his first big move in arts policy at the weekend
by nominating award-winning actress Ms Jane Alexander to chair the National
Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the government agency which issues grants to
performing and visual artists.
The chair has been vacant since January when Ms Anne-Imelda Radice, a
conservative Bush appointee, stepped down; it has been filled in the interim
by Ms Ana Steele, a longtime NEA employee, who said Ms Alexander was 'a
superb choice'.
The Endowment, which has a budget this year of Dollars 174m (Pounds 117m),
has been under heavy attack in recent years from members of Congress and
conservative religious organisations who question the government's use of
public funds to support artists who treat sexual and religious material in
an outspoken manner.
In a statement on Saturday Mr Clinton said: 'The Endowment's mission of
fostering and preserving our nation's cultural heritage is too important to
remain mired in the problems of the past.'
Ms Alexander is currently starring in the hit play The Sisters Rosensweig on
Broadway.
She has performed in 40 films and over 100 plays in New York and the
regions.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Opel hits back at VW claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S 'belated admission' that its employees had had confidential
General Motors documents in their possession, and had destroyed them, would
be of special interest to criminal investigators, Adam Opel, GM's German
subsidiary, said yesterday.
VW's admission, it added, put paid to claims that Opel had been engaged in a
campaign to defame the Wolfsburg concern and Germany by alleging industrial
espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's new production
director.
The potentially damaging admissions are believed to be contained in a
written statement sent by Mr Lopez to public prosecutors investigating
industrial espionage suspicions against him and three VW colleagues, also
former GM employees.
'Based on the present status of the investigation, it is apparent that in a
concerted action thousands of pages of highly sensitive data concerning cost
structures, manufacturing and future planning were stolen,' Opel claimed.
The US-owned company was responding to a statement published after a crisis
meeting of the VW supervisory board in Wolfsburg on Friday, which restated
its 'unaltered support' for Mr Lopez, former global purchasing director at
GM.
The 20 board members, who appoint and oversee the work of group executives,
declared that a thorough examination of evidence from Mr Lopez had shown
nothing to warrant charges of industrial espionage.
However, the statement said possibly sensitive information had been
destroyed by former GM employees, working for VW since March.
The documents had been destroyed to avoid any danger of their circulating
inside VW, it said. 'No possibly secret documents left the possession of
former GM employees and came into the possession of VW.'
Opel retorted yesterday that the information was technically and legally in
VW hands. The attempt to suggest it was shredded in the interests of Opel
was an untenable attempt to conceal the possession of a competitor's
secrets, the company added.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Hosokawa cabinet balances rivalries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S newly installed prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, early today
named a key coalition ally, Mr Tsutomu Hata, as foreign minister and deputy
premier.
In announcing his cabinet line-up, Mr Hosokawa completed a delicate
balancing act. He has put together a cabinet new enough to keep his
just-elected seven-party coalition happy, but experienced enough to ensure
continuity in government.
The core posts went to defectors from the Liberal Democratic party, now in
opposition after nearly 40 years in office. But Mr Hosokawa still found room
in the cabinet for a record three women and for two non-politicians.
Mr Hata's party, the Japan Renewal party, also picked up the posts of
agriculture minister, minister of international trade and industry, and
finance, which went to a former bureaucrat, Mr Hirohisa Fujii.
After his appointment was announced, Mr Hata said that a priority for him
would be to apologise clearly for wartime brutality in the hope of securing
a full reconciliation with other Asian countries. 'We have to find the right
words,' he said.
Other leaders of coalition parties were also rewarded with posts, including
Mr Sadao Yamahana, the Social Democratic party leader, who is the minister
responsible for political reform, which is the the policy priority of the
Hosokawa government.
Mr Hata was one of the key defectors who brought down the former Liberal
Democratic party government over its failure to enact political reforms.
The cabinet list came two days after Mr Hosokawa was elected prime minister
in a parliamentary vote that put the seal on the LDP's setback in the
general election on July 18.
There were intense negotiations to balance the interests of the seven
parties involved.
Mr Hosokawa appointed a woman, Ms Manae Kubota, to the post of Economic
Planning Agency director. The 68-year-old Ms Kubota belongs to the Social
Democratic party and has served in the Upper House of parliament.
The labour minister is Chikara Sakaguchi, a member of the Buddhist-backed
Komeito Party.
While Mr Hosokawa has been working out his cabinet, Japan's bureaucrats have
continued to do things their way.
Without consulting the new administration, finance ministry officials have
been telling other ministries that spending in next year's budget will
increase by only 3 per cent.
The ministries are supposed to present their spending plans to the finance
ministry by the end of this month, and appear to be ready to continue the
plans made under LDP rule.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Major revives 'hard Ecu' as route to union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday entered the debate over the
future of European monetary union by reviving his proposal for a 'hard Ecu'
currency unit to trade alongside Europe's national currencies.
A spokesman for Mr Major said a proposal for a hard Ecu would be considered
as 'one of a number of options' for improving economic co-operation in the
European Community.
The move appears designed to ensure that the recent turmoil in Europe's
exchange rate mechanism does not trigger an attempt by an inner core of EC
states to accelerate progress towards monetary union.
During negotiations on the Maastricht treaty in 1991, Mr Major lobbied
strongly for the hard Ecu concept as an alternative route towards European
monetary union. The idea was rejected by Britain's EC partners. But last
weekend's agreement to widen the fluctuation bands for most ERM currencies
has raised strong doubts about whether the current Maastricht plan for Emu
remains valid.
There was no reaction to the proposal from European officials yesterday. But
the finance ministers of France and Germany reiterated their confidence that
the existing timetable for Emu was valid and that the ERM could return to
narrow bands in the near future.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told German television that the
widening of the ERM bands did not compromise the move to stage two of the
Maastricht treaty at the start of 1994, which involves the setting up of a
European Monetary Institute to act as a model for an EC central bank.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, commented: 'People have
underestimated the strength of our collective European commitment.'
The credibility of the ERM may be tested again this week as France, Denmark
and Belgium continue to keep their currencies closely tied to the D-Mark by
maintaining overnight interest rates in their domestic money markets at very
high levels. Some dealers believe the high interest rate policy will not be
sustainable because of high unemployment.
Senior Tories have continued to bicker over Europe in the wake of the ERM
crisis. But there was immediate support for the hard Ecu from Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor, who told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend
that the idea was 'attractive'.
However, Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, told BBC TV's
Breakfast With Frost he did not think it would work. However, he thought the
timetable for monetary union set out by Maastricht was 'too slow.'
The hard Ecu project envisages the launch of a pan-European currency which
would keep pace with the strongest European currency at all times. If the
new currency became popular, it would gradually replace national currencies
as legal tender. If not, it would be allowed to die.
However, economists were sceptical as to whether Britain's EC partners would
adopt the idea. Mr Brian Hilliard of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said
the project would involve considerable costs because central banks would
have to pledge to buy the Ecu in exchange for Europe's strongest currency.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Clinton seeks deal with Congress on future legislation:
Democrats press for bi-partisan approach in wake of budget victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC leaders yesterday sought to capitalise on President Bill
Clinton's one-vote budget victory on Friday night by seeking to establish a
bi-partisan approach to the next important pieces of legislation due to be
presented to Congress.
'I think that in the process of governing a president has to work with the
Congress to put together majority support for a package of changes that can
pass,' Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, said yesterday.
Mr Gore said he had repeatedly reached out to his Republican opponents
during the early months of the administration but had been rebuffed.
However, he said: 'In order to address the important challenges we face now
we have got to try and create a bi-partisan approach.'
The administration's overtures reflect both a recognition of the narrowness
of its victory last week and a hope that passage of the budget will pave the
way for other important Clinton legislation, such as an overhaul of the
healthcare system and completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The loss of just one more vote among the 535 members of Congress would have
been enough to defeat Mr Clinton's budget package and deal a lasting blow to
his presidency.
The House of Representatives passed the compromise bill, which aims to cut
Dollars 496bn (Pounds 333bn) from the budget deficit over the next five
years, by 218-216, and it squeezed through the Senate only on the casting
vote of Mr Gore.
All Republicans in both houses voted against the budget bill. But Mr Bob
Dole, the Senate minority leader, said yesterday he had telephoned Mr
Clinton to congratulate him and to suggest that there were other issues
ahead on which they could work together.
He appeared to soften the Republican position on the possible imposition of
higher payroll taxes to pay for an improved healthcare programme, another
key element in Mr Clinton's plan.
Mr Dole denied telling Mr Clinton that 'under no circumstances' would
Republicans approve higher charges, but instead 'strongly disapproved' of
any such proposals. 'We have left the door open,' he said.
He stressed it would be a mistake for liberal Democrats to believe they
could raise taxes and then come back later this year and demand Republican
support for additional spending cuts: 'That's not going to happen.'
Mr Gore said he had always been confident of victory and claimed people
would now begin to see the benefits of the bill after the disinformation and
misrepresentation.
Controversy had been inevitable, he declared, because the administration was
trying to change the course of the nation by creating jobs and moving the
economy in the right direction after 12 years during which the federal
deficit had quadrupled.
He promised further spending cuts in the autumn, and forecast continued
decline in long-term interest rates. The tax cuts for small businesses would
help to create new jobs, he added, and many lower-income families would find
they were better off as a result of the bill's proposals.

FT  09 AUG 93 / Employers face extra maternity costs of Pounds 60m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH EMPLOYERS are facing extra costs of up to Pounds 60m a year as a
result of a government decision not to foot the bill for bringing UK
maternity benefits into line with EC requirements.
Under proposals to be unveiled this week, UK employers are to be asked to
pay the difference between the cost of existing maternity benefit
arrangements and the new system which must be in place by October 1994.
The decision reflects the government's determination to clamp down on its
Pounds 80bn a year social security budget as part of its onslaught on public
spending.
This was underlined yesterday when Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a
rare appearance as a newspaper columnist, in the News of the World, to
emphasise that social security spending was rising too fast and needed to be
better targeted.
A consultation document to be published this week by the Department of
Social Security is expected to set out two options for implementing the EC
proposals which are enshrined in a maternity directive agreed last year.
Both options are thought to incorporate a Pounds 4.55 increase to Pounds
52.50 a week in maternity benefit and to increase the number of women
eligible to receive an initial six weeks' maternity leave on 90 per cent of
full pay.
Currently, women in the UK are entitled to this six-week period on close to
full pay after two years' continuous employment. The proposals are expected
to cut this qualification period to either six or nine months.
The decision to load the additional cost on to employers may prove
embarrassing to the government, which has consistently argued that such
impositions should be kept to a minimum so as not to impair competitiveness.
But some left-leaning ministers will be secretly delighted that higher
payments for working mothers have been sanctioned. They see more generous
maternity and childcare entitlements as a potential Conservative vote-winner
capable of yielding substantial ballot-box dividends at a relatively low
cost.
In his News of the World column, Mr Major said the government had to ensure
both that the 'really needy' got all the help they deserved and that
taxpayers' money was not being given to 'people who don't need it.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said Mr Major's talk of
'cuts and means testing' would frighten people coping with disability,
ill-health and unemployment.

FT  07 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) Finance and the Family: Annuity rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 14th August 1993) appended to this article.
ALL THE main annuity providers cut their rates in July, says Billy Burrows,
of the London-based Annuity Direct. He adds: 'Annuity rates are linked to
gilt yields, and recent events in the exchange rate mechanism increase the
likelihood of a further fall in interest rates.
'This will, in turn, reduce gilt yields. In the short term, prospects for
annuities look good.'
Not all annuities pay out a fixed level of income. This week's table focuses
on two different types which increase in line with inflation, and at 5 per
cent. The drawback is they start from a lower base.
Peter Quinton, managing director of the Annuity Bureau, says: 'In the
accompanying table, Standard Life is costing its RPI annuity rates at
approximately 4 1/2 per cent fixed escalation, whereas National Provident
Institution is costing its annuity at approximately 6 per cent.
'This indicates how different life offices are viewing future increases in
inflation.'
The figures are provided by the Annuity Bureau, Enterprise House, 59-65
Upper Ground, London SE1 9PQ, telephone 071-620 4090.

The survey found that the Spanish drink 50 per cent more than the British,
the Germans 70 per cent more and the French 80 per cent more.
The British drink less wine per head than any other EC country apart from
Eire, only 41 per cent of the European average.
The UK is fifth in beer drinking, behind Germany, Denmark, Belgium and Eire.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Lib Dem targeting wins 19 seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS have made a net gain of 19 seats in the 183 local
authority by-elections that have been held since the county council
elections in May.
According to the Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre at the
University of Plymouth this is the result of successful targeting of
resources at promising seats, and could be translated into future gains of
parliamentary seats.
Mr Collin Rallings and Mr Michael Thrasher, of the university, said the
Liberal Democrats had gained four seats in the south-west in last year's
general election, even though their share of the national vote fell by 4.5
per cent. They said: 'Landslide local election victories in 1991 in north
Devon and Taunton Deane district councils, and Torbay Borough Council, paved
the way for a swing against the trend in April 1992.'
Writing in Local Government Chronicle, they concluded: 'Unless the Tories
manage to increase their vote at the next election, they are likely to lose
at least a handful of seats to the Liberal Democrats in southern England.'
Thirteen of the gains were from the Conservatives, with four from Labour and
two from others. Several gains were made in the south-west, but seats were
also gained in Conservative strongholds such as Basildon, Essex.
In the Labour-controlled London borough of Lambeth, recently the subject of
a fiercely critical report by the district auditor, the Liberal Democrats
last month won a seat in the Oval ward from Labour.
Labour and the Conservatives both suggested that the figures may not
indicate a national trend.
Labour said: 'This sounds very much like a protest vote against this
disaster of a government. After the last round of local elections we had the
largest presence in local government, so Labour starts with a high base
while the Liberal Democrats start with a low one.'
The Conservatives said: 'We are always disappointed to lose seats, and we
are not complacent about this. This is mid-term, so the votes could be due
to a protest.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH SOCIETY, a charity, yesterday lodged an application for leave for
a judicial review challenging the Commons' ecclesiastical committee's
support for the ordination of women priests.
Legislation which would allow the ordination of women was passed by the
general synod - the Church of England's ruling body - last November, and
approved by the committee in July.
The society alleges the committee refused to hear evidence which suggested
that the synod may have acted outside its remit.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Gore gives Clinton victory in Senate on budget bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night scored a crucial political victory when
his compromise budget bill cleared its final congressional hurdle. After a
tense day of debate and behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, the Senate approved
the measure by the narrowest possible margin - the casting vote of
Vice-President Al Gore.
The victory was even narrower than the one achieved on Thursday night in the
House of Representatives, when the bill was passed by a majority of just two
votes.
Until the last minute the Senate vote was in doubt, with everything resting
on the decision of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who, despite a 90-minute
meeting with Mr Clinton earlier in the day, had refused to make his position
known.
In his speech to the Senate, Mr Kerrey conceded he had taken 'too long' to
reach his decision. 'My head, I can say, aches with all the thinking, but my
heart aches with the conclusion - that I will vote yes for a bill which
challenges America too little,' he said.
The pressure on Mr Kerrey from fellow Democrats and promises from Mr Clinton
that further spending cuts would be considered later this year finally swung
him to cast his vote in favour of the legislation.
The passage of the bill, which aims to narrow the budget deficit by Dollars
496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, was seen by many leading
Democrats as critical to Mr Clinton's political authority and to his
campaign pledges to turn the American economy around.
The president had argued that the bill was needed to create the momentum for
further reform proposals, especially on health and welfare. It also
represented an at least temporary end to the 'gridlock' which had for the
past 12 years bedevilled relations between the president and Congress.
Mr Leon Panetta, the White House budget director, stressed yesterday that
winning the vote was the best chance for the Democrats to show that they
could govern the country even without a single Republican vote.
The result in the House the night before had been in doubt with Mr Clinton
making a vital telephone call to a wavering congresswoman only 15 minutes
before the vote.
Mrs Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who had said she would vote against the
bill, then switched sides and to Democrat applause gave Mr Clinton his
majority, 218-216. Had she kept to her original intention, the bill would
have been a vote short of the required 218.
Mr Clinton has campaigned intensively for the bill which will raise Dollars
241bn in revenue, largely by raising income tax for the wealthiest
Americans, and imposing Dollars 255bn in spending cuts, to fall heavily on
the military.
But he has faced opposition within the conservative wing of his own party,
which wants deeper spending cuts to achieve a more substantial deficit
reduction. On Thursday night in the House, 41 Democrats opposed the
compromise bill compared with 38 when the first version of the legislation
was passed.

FT  07 AUG 93 / VW says recruits destroyed GM papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN last night said that former General Motors employees, who joined
VW in March, brought or had sent to Germany documents containing possibly
'critical information'.
But it said the men destroyed the documents to avoid any danger they might
find their way into VW's possession.
VW's supervisory board, which oversees management of the German car group,
debated its row with GM over allegations of industrial espionage at an
extraordinary meeting that lasted late into the evening.
VW said the discussion was based on an 'explanation of the facts' sent by Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to prosecutors investigating allegations of
espionage against him and three colleagues. Mr Lopez switched from GM to VW
as production director in mid-March, and was followed by his colleagues.
There were no findings to warrant accusations of espionage, VW said, and the
board restated its trust in Mr Lopez. It also stressed the group's claims
that no secret documents came into VW's possession from its new employees.
The carefully worded VW statement made no connections between the documents
and any specific staff.
But its contents appeared to confirm eye-witness reports of shredders
working all night in mid-April in a house in Wiesbaden.
The house was occupied at the time by Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr
Rosario Piazza, two former employees of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary,
and associates of Mr Lopez, who joined him at VW on March 22.
In June, four removal company boxes, filled with papers and other data,
including details of a top-secret mini-car to be built by Opel, were
discovered in the house and handed over to police. Some of the data had been
assembled at the specific request of Mr Lopez.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, last week implied GM could have planted
secrets in the boxes to incriminate former employees.
The VW statement also revealed that documents had been destroyed at a hotel,
believed to be near Wolfsburg, the VW headquarters.
'In Wiesbaden, as well as in the Rothehof guesthouse, the former GM
employees took pains to ensure that documents which could possibly be traced
to GM and could contain critical information were destroyed to avoid the
danger of their being distributed within Volkswagen,' the statement said.
Over the past few months, VW has vigorously contested Opel's claims that any
secrets were involved in the affair.
Speaking after the hurriedly called meeting of the supervisory board, Mr
Piech said VW made a loss of DM355m (Pounds 140m) in the second quarter of
the current financial year, bringing the total deficit for the first half to
DM1.6bn. But the company said it could achieve a turn-round by the end of
the year.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Update for the KGB bosses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS struck, this week, by a worrying thought. I realised that I had left
the KGB bosses in St Petersburg dangling in the lurch. Not that they are
called the KGB any more. They are known as the Russian security ministry.
But in the lurch they dangled. I first made contact with the security bosses
in St Petersburg 10 months ago. I did so because I had read that they were
miffed that Barbara Hay, the new British consul-general to that city, had
been offered sumptuous quarters near the town hall in which to ply her
dangerous trade.
The security bosses were miffed because ultra-secret cables carrying
government messages run under this building. As a result, they believed that
the British intelligence service would be able to tap into these cables
'using various technical means and devices'.
So I sailed to Ms Hay's rescue. I rang Andrei Korodkhov at the security
ministry, and told him that if he would get Ms Hay bedded comfortably in her
new quarters I would radio him, regularly, intelligence news from London to
counterbalance anything Ms Hay might learn by tapping into the security
cables beneath her building.
I sent my first bulletin to St Petersburg on October 30 1992, and a second
two months later. Then - nothing. I forgot about the KGB, which was not a
good career move. So this week I made amends by radioing a bumper bulletin,
encrypted, as before, in five-digital numerical groups transformed (via
false addition: 2 + 3 = 7) by a second devious encryption.
To start with, I filled them in on the ERM. 'The collapse of the European
exchange rate mechanism', I radioed, 'holds important lessons for fledgling
Russia. First, never trust the Germans. Second, never believe the French.
The ERM was an attempt to bring stability to western Europe's warring
currencies. Unfortunately, it worked reasonably well for a long time and
then surprisingly badly for a short time. A bit like democracy, in fact.
'The ERM collapsed because it produced appalling unemployment, dangerous
smog levels, dirty beaches, a plague of boll weevils, a fall in standards
throughout Europe's media, rioting at cricket matches and a surge in
reported cases of rudeness and date rape. You are lucky you have got the
rouble to anchor you to reality.'
Then I gave them a business story. They like a nice business story in St
Petersburg. 'UK corporate biggie Cadbury Schweppes', I radioed, 'plans to
sell chocolate pandas to Chinese children - all 999m of them  - as part of a
plan to grab market leadership in the Chinese confectionery market. In 1991,
the Chinese consumed only 11,000 tonnes of chocolate whereas Britons
consumed 507,000 tonnes. Cadbury's chocky is even more addictive than opium.
Russia had better toss its hat into the ring, because full-scale chocky wars
are predicted by century's end.'
Apart from business and money matters, the Russians like to hear about the
British aristocracy and monarchy (the two are very different), so I updated
them on the eclipse of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, whose memorial service
was held in London this week.
''Intrigue follows penniless society beauty to grave',' I started, quoting
The Times' headline. Then I returned to normal mode: 'The duchess was a
woman of prodigious and fleshly appetites', I radioed, 'just like Catherine
the Great. Her behaviour shocked everyone. In a democracy, the advantage of
having aristocrats and a monarchy is that their cavortings, caperings,
sprees and feuds help take the heat off the government when times are hard.
The Russian parliament should restore your monarchy at once and create
several hundred noblemen. Then sit back and watch the fun.'
After that I turned to fashion, with this quote from The Face: ''Casual
nouveau est arrive . . . on the post-rave back of 1,000 stoned lads who've
seen fit to spend less cash on records and more on clothes. In its most
literal form, this reawakened interest in . . . conspicuous consumption and
obscure sportswear is unashamedly and simply retro'.' I had no idea what
this meant, but the code-breakers in St Petersburg are skilful and
resourceful.
Finally I sent a joke, from the FT's Observer column: 'When is the ERM not
an ERM? When it's an ERM-aphrodite.' I bet they loved that in St Petersburg.
Probably split their sides.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Private View: Moslem zealot feels the lash 0 Kalim Siddiqui,
leader of Britain's Moslem 'parliament', says the west is conducting a
crusade to crush Islam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE West allows Sarajevo to fall to the Serbs there is one voice which
may be hard to ignore in the ensuing outcry: that of Kalim Siddiqui, the
self-styled leader of the Moslem 'parliament' in Britain.
Siddiqui, an adroit pro-Iranian publicist, has faded from view since his
notorious endorsement of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death threat against
Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses. Now he has called a 'world
conference' on the Bosnian tragedy which, he claimed this week, is further
evidence of a Christian crusade to crush Islam.
For Siddiqui believes - or says he does - that western leaders are engaged
in a systematic deception over Bosnia based on deep enmity for Islam.
President Clinton's threat to strike the Serbs was, he said, 'a downright
lie, to hold the headlines while the Serbs do their dirty work.'
Kalim Siddiqui lives on a working-class housing estate in Slough and, from
the house next door, runs the Moslem Institute he founded in 1972. He was
born in India and came to Britain via Pakistan in 1954 to work as a
provincial journalist. He was a sub-editor on The Guardian for eight years
until the Iranian revolution greatly enlarged his prospects.
But for a London University-educated journalist with a PhD he shows a
surprising disregard for facts: his allegations are vague, his language
rhetorical, his logic slippery.
Siddiqui is a unelected politician, a strict Moslem who uses his religion as
a rallying cry for the social grievances of poorer Asian immigrants. Yet
during more than an hour's conversation he never once mentioned racial
discrimination. For him it is all about state-inspired religious
discrimination against Moslems. His claim to represent the view of the
majority of Britain's Moslems is hotly disputed by prominent
co-religionists.
Moslems all over Europe were feeling unsafe because of Bosnia, he claimed. I
suggested Europeans were afraid of Islamic militancy.
'You frighten them. We are not militant. We have not broken a single window.
Am I militant? Do I look a militant? My neighbours will tell you I am the
most docile fellow. Militant Islam itself is a creation of the West. Because
the West wants to hit at Islam they want to create an image that can be hit.
There is no such thing as militant Islam.' The phrase was used to describe
any cause - like the Palestinians' - which conflicted with 'western colonial
and imperialist interest'.
Is Britain still a colonial power?
'Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Here in its own domestic policy Britain would
like to see us remain here as an ex-colonial people, as a new underclass in
Britain.'
Have you been treated like that?
'Personally I have, yes. You know, I am a very integrated person as you can
see, no doubt, with all the degrees you can name from the University of
London - not from an overseas tinpot university.' He smiled with
satisfaction.
When later I asked if he felt a personal sense of grievance he said: 'No,
no, no. I have been very well treated. No, I am very well integrated.'
But the attitude of the native British irritates you?
'Yes, it does. Your attitude, today, has been very irritating.'
Yes, I said. What is it that irritates you?
'Your superiority, your white man's burden, your colonial . . .' He broke
off. 'You know . . . This little man from Pakistan sitting here in suburban
Slough talking to me like this: shouldn't he be more docile to me? That is
your attitude.'
I'm trying to impose my colonial manners on you?
'Yes, yes. That I have somehow invaded British privacy by setting up a
parliament here, you know, by identifying ourselves as Moslems we are
offending the sensibilities of the British people.'
I asked for examples of persecution by the Establishment. Siddiqui cited the
Rushdie affair. I pointed out that Salman Rushdie was not exactly a member
of the British Anglican Establishment. Much more convincing was his case for
religious schools.
'We have been applying for 15 years and repeatedly told it wouldn't be
allowed. We don't want favours, just our rights under the law.
Voluntary-aided schools are denied us because we are a non-European culture
and they fear that through our schools we would perpetrate a non-European
culture on British soil. They would like us to assimilate. They call it
integration but really they want to destroy our identity, our civilisation.'
He agreed that Britain guaranteed freedom of worship 'so long as religion
remains a matter between the individual and his Creator. As soon as it
becomes politicised, then of course it becomes unacceptable.'
Don't you agree with that?
'No, because we have a political culture of our own. The government doesn't
mind if churches are only used once a week. But that is not my religion. I
am here to make sure the Moslems of this country do not become an
underclass, that they are lifted off the economic floor.'
Are you using the religious weapon to get economic benefits for your
community?
'I am not trying to get any economic benefit for them.'
You said you were trying to lift them off the floor . . .
Siddiqui changed tack and talked about unemployment, which he claimed was
higher for Moslems than for other immigrants.
His Moslem Institute has published a manifesto whose language of zealotry
has been construed to mean that Siddiqui and his supporters want a state
within a state.
'This is nonsense. of course. There are a number of states within a state:
the Church of England, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the trade
union movement. We can define a lawful purpose, we are exercising our
freedom of association.
'We are not separatists. I want to insist that everything we want to do is
within the framework of statute law. The moment I break the laws come and
catch me. Then you are entitled to try me and jail me and quarter me and
hang me.'
I thought of the occasions during the Rushdie row when there were calls for
Siddiqui to be prosecuted for incitement to murder. You have come quite
close to it, I said.
'I am entitled to the entire width and breadth of the field,' he smiled.
You were sailing pretty close to the wind.
'If you are sailing in rough waters as I do, I have to sail close to the
wind. Give me the benefit of the doubt and say I am a good sailor.'
The purpose of my visit had been to ask Siddiqui about the obligations of
immigrants towards their adoptive country, and vice versa. I raised the
first point. Siddiqui went off at a tangent, saying migration for Moslems
was almost an obligation in itself.
Did you migrate for theological reasons?
'No, I didn't migrate. I came as a student and stayed.'
To get a benefit.
'To . . . to . . . to . . . ,' he spluttered. 'What does a student do?'
Get a benefit, I repeated.
'You know, this is where your mentality is so crude. You can only think in
terms of benefit. I am sorry about this. Your mentality comes out. Can you
see how hostile you are, now, at this very moment? When you walk out of
here, I will view you as a hostile person because you cannot see anything
other than the benefit we have got out of it. You don't see what benefit we
have given to this country.'
We'll come on to that.
'No, no, you won't come on to it, because I know. You will never acknowledge
it. The country will not acknowledge it. We were brought in to do the menial
jobs, low wages, live in marginal housing and not to talk back to the Great
Big White Man.'
The British government, he said finally, had 'totally and miserably failed'
in its obligation as host.
'We are a major civilisation, a major culture, a major religion. To expect
us to walk down the gangway at Heathrow airport and say 'Right, at this
moment I am now British, my culture is a thing of the past . . .''
That is not quite what I am suggesting, I said. I am talking about
compromise.
Siddiqui the sailor changed tack again. Now he was all sweet reason.
'You see, I believe in integration. It is essential, it is natural, it is
the right thing to happen. It is like ageing. It will be two, three, four
generations before it happens but in the meantime it is my duty to make sure
my children are not trampled upon by the host culture. It has to be managed
otherwise it will create hostilities on both sides.'
What about the whole apparatus of community relations, equal opportunities,
the race relations Act . . .
'This is such a trap,' he interrupted.
. . . designed to help your people?
'No it's not. It's trying to divert us. It is designed to basically - your
word - to oppress us.' Siddiqui said he had twice refused invitations to sit
on race relations committees: they were attempts to prevent 'proper leaders'
emerging.
Why should a government encourage people like you to emerge and shout
'Unfair]'?
'If I have emerged why don't you let me get on with it? Why give me this
demonising treatment in the media? You want to destroy me.'
You have been created by the media, partly, too. It cuts both ways.
'It cuts both ways, yeah,' he admitted.
Siddiqui's PhD thesis was called The Function of International Conflict and
was about Pakistan. I said: You talk as if you prefer conflict to
conciliation.
'No. That is not right. I don't like getting into the headlines, believe it
or not. Please believe me. I am a victim of the Rushdie affair. I was
brought out of my obscurity.'
Isn't it very dangerous to stir people into thinking they are being
persecuted for their religion rather than disadvantaged economically?
'I think you have made a very reasonable point. It is a valid point. I wish
it were possible not to raise the issues in the terms in which I have had to
raise them. But remember, the whole thing goes back to the Rushdie affair.
There might not have been a Moslem parliament had it not been for The
Satanic Verses.'
There probably would have been no Kalim Siddiqui, either.
'You are absolutely right. I wanted to get on and do my own work. I am a
political thinker. I did not expect to end up as a politician, as a public
figure. This has destroyed my life. I am wasting my time talking to you
now.'
I had a sudden thought. Do you have an inferiority complex about English
culture? I asked.
He did not rant, but for the first time fell silent. 'Good question. I have
never thought about it.' There was a long pause. 'Can't answer it. Don't
know. I don't think so. If anything I think it's probably the other way
round.'
Siddiqui the fundamentalist firebrand seemed to have evaporated. In his
place sat a tubby, self-important character with a grey beard, fresh face
and soulful eyes. He looked about as dangerous as something out of Snow
White.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Behind the Queen's curtains: Buckingham Palace opens to the
public today. Antony Thorncroft took the tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'They've lowered their guard at Buckingham Palace.
The press poured in, bereft of malice.'
I HAVE never seen such a subdued hack pack. The opening of most of the
finest state apartments at Buckingham Palace to the public from today seems
likely to re-establish the gap between sovereign and subjects. Nowhere in
the kingdom, nowhere in the world, is such a concentrated collection of
masterpieces displayed in such an exalted residential setting.
And since the monarchy is mainly theatre, the tour is a masterpiece of
dramatic timing. It begins pianissimo. If you dared speak in the
well-regulated splendour you might remark that the Grand Hall is quite
small, almost domestic, and the Grand Staircase scarcely over-powering.
But even in these foothills there are the clues to the secret of Buckingham
Palace. It is a shrine to ancestor worship. The walls of the staircase are
covered with portraits of Queen Victoria's forbears and family, both the
rogues, like her father, the Duke of York, and the characters, like the Duke
of Sussex in a kilt.
The palace is one monumental family album, with the same faces, especially
its founder George IV and his amiable mother, Queen Charlotte, looking down
in myriad guises. Sometimes the family are in fancy dress - there is Prince
Albert carved as a Roman soldier; sometimes they are pitiful - as in a
portrait of the apotheosis of the short-lived princes, Octavius and Alfred,
on their way to heaven; sometimes humanity peeps through, as in the portrait
of Queen Victoria at her coronation, a tiny apprehensive porcelain doll
receiving the hurrahs of her confident subjects.
No one is forgotten. There is a tiny octagonal vestibule given over to
portraits of Queen Victoria's daughters-in-law. The only members of the
family mysteriously absent are the Queen and her immediate relatives.
As soon as you reach the first floor you are thrown another dramatic theme:
this building is about majesty. Everything, every object, every vista, every
cornice, every fabric, proclaims wealth and splendour. You quickly accept
that the palace contains the finest collection of Sevres porcelain;
unequalled examples of French 18th century furniture by Weisweiler, Carlin,
and Reisener; and a picture collection stuffed with Rubens, Rembrandts, and
Van Dycks. Amid such ornate decoration the actual Throne Room can dare to be
quite sparse, bereft of thrones, but with two comfortable looking chairs
embroidered with an 'EII' and a 'P'.
After a surfeit of decorative grandeur the Picture Gallery becomes almost
pedestrian. I thought it one of the least successful rooms, with its
shrimp-pink wall-covering, grills to the electric fires barely hidden inside
marble, and the worthiness of the collection, the 18th century's homage to
the artists of the 17th. There are splendid things, the Rembrandt portrait
of Agatha Bas; the Rubens of St George; the Cuyp of a negro page. But you
look in vain for a decorative splash, something French and glitzy. It will
look better when the Canalettos return.
Having lulled the visitor into a dreamy acceptance of the luxurious the tour
ends with a jolt in the finest and happiest rooms, all designed by Nash,
with plenty of quirky detail. There is the extraordinary sculpted memorial
to that arch republican Milton in the Blue Drawing Room; the critical line
of portraits in the State Dining Room (bereft of its table and silver); the
fake door of looking glass and pier table in the White Drawing Room through
which the royal family materialises to startle its guests.
Then there is a lowering again as you descend to the Marble Hall, almost a
feeling of returning to a nether world after observing the glory of the
gods. It is a hushed finale.
Of course these are state apartments, absent of any manifestation of a
living majesty. But through the windows of the charming Music Room you see a
red-coated servant keeping a wary eye on three waddling corgies, and as you
stroll through the garden to the exit you call at the shop and buy the
chocolates, crockery and videos, plus the excellent guide to the palace
prepared by Apollo magazine, which, with the Pounds 8 entry fee, will help
the Queen raise approaching Pounds 3m in the next eight weeks towards the
restoration of Windsor Castle.
The palace, so austere from the outside, offers a stunning, unsettling
surfeit of an experience, eased by the charm of the attendants.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Rites of Summer: The creak of ageing willow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WE ALL know, modern professional cricketers arrive at the crease clad in
armour only slightly less impressive than that of a Chieftain tank. But
their eyes are keen, their reactions electric. The wickets they play on are
pedantically manicured, regular to a fault. So the need for bodily
protection, at the professional level, is not great.
The players who really need the helmets, thigh-pads and tungsten-reinforced
boxes are the cricketers who only turn out once a year. Their co-ordination
is rotten. They bat on a sloping surface of stubs, divots and grasses
well-known to connoisseurs of set-aside. They face bowlers who tickle the
divots with one delivery, and with the next fling a full-toss at the
cranium. But what thoughts of their own human frailty are entertained by
these occasional players?
None. Not even a copy of The Economist strapped to the thigh. From an
ancient brass-bound trunk, the occasional cricketer roots out a pair of
wickerwork pads, a shrivelled felt cap in the old school colours, and a bat
of brittle willow, which in the event of striking the ball cleanly sends
massive reverberations around the frame of whoever wields it.
It is a sort of summer madness that allows the occasionals to take to the
field like this, and a peculiar hubris that makes a man believe that
cricketing skills, once instilled, are enduringly residual.
If asked by his captain to take a couple of overs, the occasional cricketer
likes to think that his dormant skills are readily on tap. A half-dozen
wides and no balls ensue; but he feels the old line and length reasserting
themselves. Looking down at the flannels last laundered a year ago, he
pastes one side of the ball with spittle and gets a red rub going. Where is
that pleasing hiss of velocity which once sang in his adolescent ears?
The toll for this foolish pride is exacted the next day. And every morning,
probably, for the next week. Yet it is guaranteed that when the call comes
round the following year - Accounts vs Sales; a provocative Aussie raising
his compatriots from their bar stools; a visiting trade delegation from
Swaziland or Swat - the occasional cricketer will blot out the memories of
pain. To decline the tussle remains beyond him: this is the bond of boyhood
on middle age.
So the madness persists. For those prone to it, I can only offer these
salient rules:
1) Batting. In spite of the foregoing, in occasional cricket it is always
easier to face fast bowling than slow. The captain may flatter you by
saying: 'You shall be our Beefy.' Your sobriquet may only be earned by a
succession of what are generically known as cow-shots. But in occasional
cricket, fast bowling is rarely aimed at the wicket, and any of the
following strokes should speed past a naturally inert wicket-keeper towards
the boundary: the startled nick, the shy flourish, the speculative prod and
the crisply mistimed slash.
2) Bowling. Let others go for pace. Vaguely say that you will do 'a modified
googly, coming round the wicket.' Float something towards the batsman on his
leg side. Make each delivery follow its own singular flight path. There is
an art to doing this without actually bowling a wide. You may get struck out
of the ground, but more likely the batsman will swipe and scythe at a
conglomeration of pure air.
3) Fielding. It is desirable to take up a position neither too near to the
batsman nor too far. The dangers at close quarters need not be specified.
But those idle sportsmen who imagine that they can hover at some tropical
reach of the boundary and peruse their Joanna Trollope without disturbance
require a caution.
True, the ball rarely speeds out that far. But when it does, be warned. The
throwing arm does not survive a desk-bound life, and nothing is more
humiliating to middle-aged virility than having to return a cricket ball to
the crease with a series of three, or even four, successively pathetic lobs.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Fantastic years with the Oslo Phil - Andrew Clark
admires the loyalty and skill of conductor Mariss Jansons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra still cannot believe their good
fortune. Ten years after attracting international attention with the first
of their Tchaikovsky recordings, their performances of romantic and early
modern masterpieces continue to draw critical superlatives. The architect of
the orchestra's success, Mariss Jansons, shows no sign of leaving, despite
big-money offers from elsewhere. Their touring schedule this month takes in
Europe's four leading music festivals - Salzburg, Lucerne, Edinburgh and the
London Proms.
Like their colleagues in Birmingham, the Oslo musicians have successfully
challenged the supremacy of traditional musical centres like London and
Vienna. They have developed a reputation for fresh, alertly-balanced and
often thrilling performances, notable for clarity and point - a reflection
of Jansons's own virtues. They have avoided the trap of being tied to a
particular corner of the repertoire: it is over two years since they played
a Tchaikovsky symphony, and in the absence of a strong national school of
music in Norway, they are free to take on tour everything from Berlioz to
Bartok.
And yet success has sprung from an unlikely source. Here is an orchestra
which, despite a 75-year history, has no great tradition of its own; which
is based on the fringe of musical Europe, in a country with the same
population as Finland (four million) but fewer than half the number of
symphony orchestras; which is paid less than its counterparts in Denmark and
Germany; and which receives at home a shadow of the acclaim it wins abroad.
So why does a world-class conductor like Jansons choose to stay? It is
widely accepted that the two other orchestras with which he is closely
associated - the St Petersburg and London Philharmonics - would be better
off with Jansons than with their present chief conductors. He tours
extensively with the St Petersburg orchestra (another London concert is
scheduled for November), and the LPO link is developing well, with a steady
flow of recordings and talk of a Glyndebourne production.
But with the Oslo Philharmonic, the relationship can only be defined in
terms of love. Jansons - at 50 still remarkably boyish-looking - is a
conductor who gets close to his musicians, who refuses to rush his career or
repertoire. When he came to Oslo in 1979, it was his first principal
conductor's post, giving him the chance to develop out of the international
limelight. The orchestra is his 'child': most of the players are in their
mid-to-late thirties, have grown with him and now reflect his musical
personality. They have repaid his loyalty with unstinting dedication. His
own view is that as long as he has something to give and is wanted, he will
stay.
A visit to the Oslo Concert Hall, a stone's throw from the waterfront in the
city centre, uncovers some of the mechanics of this extraordinary
partnership. Jansons limits his time with the Oslo Philharmonic to 12 weeks
of the year, in the belief that every time a chief conductor returns 'it
should be an event. Some joy is very important'. This is reflected in the
buzz pervading the hall when he is present. He may not hold the title of
artistic director - the orchestra itself takes responsibility for year-round
decision-making (an unheard-of arrangement for a contract orchestra in
Britain) - but his influence is immense, every visit a hectic round of
meetings, auditions and rehearsals. According to Trond Okkelmo, the
orchestra's manager, 'Mariss doesn't need power and position to have
authority. That's his personality - he lets things flourish as long as he
thinks it's in the right direction.'
Jansons's ideals - many of them learned from his mentor, the legendary St
Petersburg conductor Evgeny Mravinsky - have become part of the orchestra's
work ethic. The Oslo musicians respond best to conductors who work them
hard, because that is the way Jansons has trained them. Although there is
room for humour, rehearsals are notable for the absence of chatter. Jansons,
speaking in a mixture of English, German and Italian, is quick and precise
in his corrections, the sign of a conductor who comes well prepared. The
players organise their own weekly sectional rehearsals. Distinguished guest
instrumentalists are invited to lead three-day seminars.
Lack of complacency is one of the Oslo Philharmonic's most refreshing
qualities. Nothing is taken for granted - not even recognition at home. That
is in part a reflection of the Norwegian character: 'if you have a success,
don't allow yourself to believe you're somebody', as one of the musicians
disdainfully puts it. The orchestra receives the same basic pay as its
regional counterparts in Bergen and Trondheim. This has prompted Jansons -
Latvian by birth, Russian by citizenship - to go on the offensive,
campaigning for tangible acknowledgement of the orchestra's achievements.
Recent years have seen the playing strength raised from 78 to 103,
capitalising on the stream of talented string players graduating from Oslo's
young music academy. Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest industrial enterprise,
has signed a long-term sponsorship contract, enabling the orchestra to
maintain a healthy output of recordings and go on tour with heavily-scored
works like Strauss's Alpine Symphony (and an orchestra physiotherapist]).
The musicians are now looking for a white knight to finance acoustical
adjustments to their home, a dark prism-shaped auditorium dating from 1977,
with a stage so wide that they cannot hear each other properly.
Despite the relatively low pay, the Oslo Philharmonic knows the meaning of
job satisfaction. Its musicians have permanent contracts and play to full
houses. Each of their concerts is broadcast nationally (by the Norwegian
Broadcasting Corporation, which contributes a third of the orchestra's
budget). Above all, they have in Jansons a conductor who is as inspiring as
he is uncompromising. 'Whenever this ends, we're going to look back and say
these were fantastic years,' muses Arne Jorgen Oian, the orchestra's
principal second violin. 'The great thing is, we're realising it while it
happens.'
Mariss Jansons conducts the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra at Salzburg tomorrow
morning, at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on August 22, London's Royal Albert
Hall on August 23 and 24, Lucerne on August 26 and 27, and Birmingham's
Symphony Hall on August 31. The tour soloists are Yuri Bashmet and Midori.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: When Vienna was red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Karl-Marx-Hof, that austere 1920s block of workers' flats, is the most
obvious monument of Vienna's socialist administration in the 11 years from
1922. But it is only one example among many; the city council built 65.000
dwelling units in that period, as well as pioneering an enormous programme
of social legislation. A new exhibition in the Historical Museum of the City
of Vienna covers all of this and transports us back to an age of political
idealism.
While the Austrian republic was being proclaimed from the steps of the
Vienna parliament house on November 12 1918, some of the more extreme
adherents of the city's socialist majority tore the white stripes out of the
Austrian flag and flew the red which remained. The country's Christian
Socialist government duly got the message and separated Vienna
administratively from Lower Austria to seal off the socialist virus.
Vienna, now quasi-independent, set about tackling the enormous problems of
poverty and underprivilege that existed in the city. The city council
introduced measures which have today become part of the baggage of all
political parties, more or less, but which were revolutionary then. It
introduced programmes of mother-and-child care, and set up medical care,
advisory services, orphan homes; it built swimming baths and paddling pools.
It built the Vienna stadium in the Prater and organised a Workers' Olympics
in 1931. Under Otto Sloeckel it reorganised education, breaking with the
tradition of military-style discipline and adopting curricula and teaching
methods more suitable to the child.
Notes for a speech by Gloekel, displayed at the exhibition, sum up its
ambition: to form 'sincere, happy, hard-working and morally sound
republicans'. One is uncomfortably reminded of those red banners inscribed
with slogans that used to hang across so many streets in eastern and central
Europe. The difference is that in the 1920s it was still possible to believe
in the Message.
Culturally, Red Vienna had big ambitions; it aimed to open the whole field
of bourgeois high culture to the working class and believed that was what it
really wanted. It also put on symphony concerts for workers; it even tried
to set up people's universities. The art it produced consisted mainly of
statuary glorifying heroic labour, like Otto Hoffner's Youth With A Hammer.
But there was also political cabaret (though not of a very high standard)
and of course hundreds of posters, some hectoring and accusatory, some
celebratory of organised labour: a long hoarding of these has been put up
outside the museum; you have to walk past it before you go in.
And there are all those flats. The exhibition renders a service by reminding
us just how many and varied they were, and that they were not really an
innovation: even before the turn of the century Vienna had started building
workers' accommodation to the pattern later adopted by Karl Ehn and other
architects, namely rectangular blocks around a central green space.
Most of them are in the Bauhaus-inspired style of the 1920s. The
Karl-Marx-Hof is stark and functional, but with little towers at intervals
and sets of three balconies one above the other like the wrinkles on a
furrowed brow. But others are more graceful - for example Hubert Gessner's
Reumann-Hof. One block, the Heim-Hof, had no kitchens in its flats; instead,
there was an excellent communal canteen which the Nazis closed down after
the anschluss. The tenants then had to build little cooking niches for
themselves.
Even before the Nazis came, Dolfuss had sacked the Vienna City Council and
replaced it by a nominated mayor and corporation. There was a concerted
rising against him in 1934, bloodily put down. The Karl-Marx-Hof was
bombarded with artillery.
You can still see most of the flats in various parts of the city today. The
humbler, more practical work of Red Vienna still stands. What seems to have
vanished without trace is its high-flown political rhetoric: who believes in
the New Socialist Man today?

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Fun to be part of the mob - Julius Caesar at Stratford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID Thacker has followed up his revealing modern-dress city-slicker
Merchant of Venice at the big Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a modern-dress
Julius Caesar at the Other Place. This time, he means the revelation to lie
in the way we watch it. So his production occurs in promenade style. The
downstairs audience moves around from scene to scene, as the actors keep
using different parts of the space. (There are some reserved seats in the
balcony.)
There is a certain buzz to be had from, say, sitting cross-legged at the
foot of Caesar's desk while Calphurnia gulps his Scotch to calm her
superstitious fears. To find yourself standing a mere yard from the
assassins as they roll up their shirt-sleeves and bathe their arms in
Caesar's blood is as nicely horrid as you can suppose.
Obviously the big pay-off occurs with 'Friends, Romans, countrymen,' that
triumph of demagoguery, when it is fun to be part of the mob that Antony is
manipulating from his pulpit - and, later, to encircle him as he reveals
Caesar's corpse. This highly political play really seems to be nearer than
your doorstep. But the illusion of participating in history sags later.
During the final battle, you squat or shuffle or slouch. The smoke, stink
and machine-gunfire that are the battle of Philippi are never threatening.
Still, Thacker's approach might reap dividends throughout - if only he had
chosen the right actors. I guess he is trying to shake up our preconceptions
about the four leading roles, but what is he driving at? And why has he
chosen an Antony (Barry Lynch) with a much more 'lean and hungry look' than
his Cassius (Rob Edwards)? (When Caesar remarks on Cassius's leanness to
Antony, the latter is in running shorts in mid-audience, so there is no
missing this.)
The big error, however, is the Brutus. Can you believe that 'the noblest
Roman of them all' conspires Caesar's death with his hands in his pockets?
Jeffery Kissoon, for all his vocal and physical prowess, misfires in every
way. No stoicism, no inwardness, no integrity. He is shifty in council,
smarmy with Caesar; and he misses the sudden mid-scene rushes of tenderness
with Portia, Cassius or Volumnius. As when playing Shakespeare elsewhere, he
applies a barking marcato to key syllables, mumbles minor ones, and throbs
out a rapid tremolo on big words, faking a lyricism that is not in his vein.
Everyone else in the cast acts more naturally - though Tricia Kelly and
Francesca Ryan are coarse in all the female roles. But both Cassius (Rob
Edwards), when conspiring with Casca, and Antony (Barry Lynch), in his
soliloquy above the corpse, also lack spontaneity: too much vocal technique,
too schematically applied. Lynch is lightweight, a canny charmer, but he
carries off the funeral demagoguery with easy assurance, mainly in that
smouldering pianissimo that is the favourite weapon in his armoury. Edwards
seems, when with Brutus, to attempt the republican nobility that this Brutus
omits. He misses, however, Cassius's blend of fanaticism and cynicism.
David Sumner's Caesar is a suave old fox, a smooth dictator, credible if not
Colossal. Thacker makes his Rome a quasi-fascist police state, which makes
it all the more frustrating that the dissident Brutus doesn't ring true. The
battle fails to convince. The widow (Tricia Kelly) who wheels a corpse in a
pram through the audience while maintaining a silent scream is the crudest
thing I have seen in a long while. The play works fluently in the theatre -
it always does. When I tell you, however, that the detail that lingers
largest in my mind is Caesar taking a puff of Ventolin . . .

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: The Caruso of rock 'n' roll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROY Kelton Orbison (1936-1988) was the unmistakable singer with the pasty
complexion, the black Raybans and the ubiquitous voice. Only The Lonely at
the Liverpool Playhouse is a tribute to Orbison, more musical than
theatrical. It is, as Rob Reiner once said, not a documentary but a
rockumentary, a welcome chance to hear the wonderful songs. It makes a
vastly enjoyable evening: capacious, lyrical and exciting.
The musical has arrived at an opportune time, with Grease bringing the 1950s
to the West End and preparing the way for this 1960s collection. Yet Only
The Lonely has no dramatic form other than a meeting between Orbison and his
son in Ohio at Orbison's last concert. Author Laurence Ross had only to link
the tunes.
As Orbison explains himself to his son, the extraordinary serendipity of his
life reveals itself. The Caruso of rock 'n' roll stumbled into his own image
as if by chance. He first wore the dark glasses because he left his own on a
plane when touring with the Beatles. He intended to give 'Only The Lonely'
to Elvis Presley, but the King was sleeping when Orbison called, and he
decided to record it himself. The habitual black clothes were almost an
afterthought: Orbison's wife says unimaginatively 'You look great in black,
Roy.'
Orbison's sombre life bears an exact relation to the songs. His estranged
and then reinstated wife Claudette died in a motorcycle crash, two of his
three sons died in a basement fire, and Orbison underwent triple bypass
surgery before his final seizure. He comes across as a passive, innocent
man, more sung against than singing. Out of this misery came the fine 'In
Dreams', 'Running Scared', 'Pretty Woman' and 'You Got It'.
It is an ambitious musical which puts the Beatles on stage in Liverpool, but
this Bill Kenright production offers Bob Dylan, kd lang and Bruce
Springsteen as well. The impersonations work well, with Karl Lornie
twitching the violin bass as he plays Paul McCartney and Martin Glyn Murray
strumming nervously as John Lennon and then posturing with it as Bruce
Springsteen.
Larry Branson as Orbison is superb, looking and sounding like him, floating
to the high notes and plummeting to the low growl. This is Branson's first
acting role, since he usually has only to sing in his career as Roy Orbison;
but luckily Orbison was undemonstrative to a fault. Even in the most
frenetic numbers, Orbison allowed himself only a flexing of the right knee.
Ian Kellgren's direction and Keith Strachan's musical direction give life
and point to Orbison's songs, which remained the same while fashions changed
around them. They are infectious and catchy here, tightly played and fully
produced. Orbison recorded nothing between 1969 and 1988, when he reemerged
with a TV special involving Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Jennifer Warnes.
This in turn led to the Travelling Wilburys (with Bob Dylan and friends) and
a revival of interest in Orbison. He died in December of that year.
The Liverpool Playhouse until August 28

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: On politicians and poets - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE you went to bed last night, you could have heard the first of Radio
4's 'experimental' series, Rushes. This was SplashPast, a 25-minute trip
along the River Trent, local history interspersed with pleasant rippling
sounds, just the thing to lull you to sleep.
And not long after you get up this morning, at 11 am, there begins the
revived series, Talking Politics, where David Walter presents all-round
portraits of the new generation of European politicians. Today's is Volker
Ruhe, the German Minister of Defence; in the next three weeks come Nicolas
Sarkozy, French Budget Minister, who should have a lot to tell us, Ruud
Lubbers, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, and Italian Mario Segni.
Ruhe, 50, would like to be Chancellor, though Kohl is not keen on it.
Like most Hamburgers, Ruhe is outward-looking; As a boy, he did an
attachment to Hurstpierpoint College, where, he says, 'he learnt English and
rugby'. Formerly a right-wing hard-liner (compared by a colleague to Lord
Tebbitt), he melted enough to propose a coalition with the Social Democrats,
but has hardened since. He is anxious that Germany should not be bound by
the post-war constitution preventing the use of German forces in
peace-keeping activities. In Europe, he believes alike in sovereignty and
integration. This interesting half-hour concluded that Ruhe, 'the new style
German politician', knew well the influence that the past has had on the
present, but was no part of that past himself.
In The Silver in the Stone (Radio 4, Thursday) Andy Croft suggested that the
fate of poet John Clare might still befall ambitious writers from
un-literary backgrounds. Clare, a farm-worker, published his first verses to
the acclamation of established poets, but was later dropped by his
publisher, who thought his work 'too common' and reckoned that the
Northampton enclosures were no matter for poetry, especially when ill-spelt
and punctuated. Clare went mad. His work is now included in the official
curriculum.
Croft presented some current writers' comments. A well-thought-of Welsh
miner-poet, Mogg Williams, thought it a privilege for people like him to
talk with academics: but also vice versa. Rebecca O'Rourke, a working-class
Manchester writer, has to fight against judgments like 'minority interest',
'marginal'. Even Melvyn Bragg says that writing about work is 'hard to
place'. He is not in Clare's world, though; however deep his concern with
his Cumbrian roots, it must have been broadened at Wadham. O'Rourke feels
that writing does not betray one's class, but is a duty, to 'give back' what
was given by education. A point Croft overlooked is that academics today
understand working people's problems when they study them. You could not
want more discerning workers' poetry than the 'Bagpipe Music' of Louis
MacNeice (Marlborough, Merton).
Radio 3's Saturday evening Studio Three play really was experimental this
week; Steve May's Testosterone I Sing was set simultaneously on the walls of
Troy and on some English village cricket-ground. The events at each place
have much in common. Among the Greeks, there is a contest between Ajax and
Odysseus for Achilles' armour, and on the cricket-ground there is a dispute
about whether Sulk or Breeze shall open the bowling. There is most fun among
the Greeks, where Odysseus and his mates spy on Ajax's 'unspeakable'
treatment of goats, after a vision of Pallas has questioned his marriage to
ugly Tecmesa. Cricketers are content with more usual sexual encouragement.
Finally the Chorus, serving both parties, calls for the erection of a
memorial to all who take either sport or war too seriously. A just
conclusion indeed, and amusing if not too serious comment. Richard Wortley
directed.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Behind the Fringe - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT WEEKEND thousands of wannabes will be arriving in Edinburgh for the
biggest annual audition in the arts world. The Edinburgh Fringe, which in
size, audience and innovative achievement now surpasses the Edinburgh
Festival, is the one place where you can still go on stage a kid and come
off a star.
The precedents are most encouraging. In pre-history there was the Beyond the
Fringe crew (who were actually appearing at the Festival); in living memory
there is Rowan Atkinson; and every subsequent year there have been young
entertainers who have turned up as unknowns and left with a TV contract in
their jeans' pocket. Last year it was Bruce Morton; the year before Frank
Skinner.
There are many complaints about the Fringe - that it has become a business;
that it is dominated every year by the same group of stand-up comedians;
that the best venues are stitched up well in advance - but every year the
entertainment industry moves there en masse. In 1993 there will be a record
571 companies presenting over 1,200 shows, and that excludes the students,
street artists, eccentrics and drifters who flock to Edinburgh in August,
just in case . . .
But the very success of the Fringe is producing change. The money men are
moving in. This year the three leading venues, the Assembly Rooms, the
Pleasance and the Gilded Balloon, which between them control 17 performing
outlets and claim half the Fringe audience of 600,000, are pooling their
marketing. This loose merger has been greased by Stella Artois, which is
giving over Pounds 100,000 towards a Comedy Festival embracing the venues.
An indication of the new commercial spirit is that if the acts on the bill
do not attract a fixed amount of TV coverage, with the inevitable plugs for
the lager, Stella Artois can withhold some of its investment. Two other
medium-sized venues, Hill Street and Old St Pauls, are also joining forces
on promotion.
Bill Burdett-Coutts, who runs the Assembly Rooms, justifies this approach
with the economic facts of life. His three-week residency at the Rooms turns
over almost Pounds 1m but profits rarely top Pounds 5,000, and some years
there is a loss. Karen Koren at the Gilded Balloon has suffered severe
deficits, especially in her attempts to keep open throughout the year. Only
by attracting outside money and co-ordinating the publicity can the venues
guarantee their future, and ensure that a wide range of performers,
theatrical groups as well as the cheap stand-up comedians, feature in the
programme. This year actors from Georgia and the Ukraine are at the Assembly
Rooms because Burdett-Coutts can afford to take more risks. The venues want
to develop a productions fund to ensure that the Fringe does not become, as
many fear, just a comedy festival.
But there is concern that the three powerful venues, presenting performances
all day, will draw audiences away from smaller, out of the way, Fringe
events. It is good for the Steven Berkoffs, the Jo Brands, and the Arthur
Smiths: not so good for the new faces.
Mhairi Mackenzie-Robinson, administrator of the Fringe, is not worried -
yet. 'The Fringe is self-regulatory. It is an open festival'. Its strength
has always been its ability to absorb anyone that turns up at Edinburgh and
seeks its advice and support.
This year that includes everyone from elderly comedians like Michael Bentine
and Barry Cryer to the usual eclectic mish-mash. The Fringe reflects what
concerns artists at any particular moment. This year there are three shows
about The Carpenters, the wholesome 1960s pop group, and three about Don
Quixote. Make what you can of that.
*****
The Arts Council is back-tracking furiously on its proposal to cut Pounds
1.4m from its drama budget by axing the grants of ten leading regional
theatres. A meeting of its drama panel this week recommended that if the
budget has to be reduced by 3.6 per cent then every theatre receiving a
grant should suffer equal misery.
This runs counter to the view of the Council's boss, Anthony Everett, who
wants to create priorities, but it gives the Council a chance to get off the
hook. The panel is also asking the Council to rescind the basic decision to
cut the theatre grant. The general drift is to wait and see the size of the
total Arts Council budget after the Chancellor's November statement.
The Heritage Minister Peter Brooke has made it clear that he opposes the
decision to hit the theatres, and this week gave Pounds 175,000 in
restoration grants to the Belgrade, Coventry, which is reported to be on the
list. Since Brooke decides the size of the Council's grant he is well placed
to discreetly get his way - and make a nonsense of the arm's length
principle.
*****
In the last three months 64 works of art, including a Tompion clock and a
Sisley landscape, have been added to the list of works of art which are
conditionally exempt from inheritance tax because they are, in theory,
available for public view. In all around 9,100 objects enjoy this status.
The joke is, of course, that the public never gets to see them.
Before the scandal broke in 1992 perhaps one or two people a year asked to
see the list, kept at the V&amp;A. The number of enquiries has scarcely
increased. How many asked an owner whether they could come and view the
object no one knows. This seems a poor return in terms of public aesthetic
pleasure for the Pounds 1b which the nation has lost in tax during the past
decade through this loophole.
Of course few object to exemption for the Duke of Sutherland's pictures, on
permanent view in the National Gallery of Scotland, or the collection at
Chatsworth, or in the many noble houses open to the public. But the 3,169
pictures; the 1,189 items of furniture; the 912 pieces of European ceramics
and glass included on the now computerised list and not regularly available
for inspection, should be exposed to searching public gaze.
Museum directors should examine the list to see if it includes objects that
would grace their collections through short-term loan, and the Inland
Revenue must continue with its hesitant policy of shedding some light,
through a quarterly progress report, on what is little more than a tax
dodge.

Miraculously, dealers are reporting sales at Monte Carlo's tenth Biennale
des Antiquaires, held in Monaco's International Sporting Club until August
15. Inaugurated by Prince Rainier, Prince Albert and a crush of very
sunburnt Riviera socialites this year's event is the biggest ever with 30
dealers, seven from outside France, who have brought the very best the
international trade has to offer.
Flemish painting socialist Monica Kruch from Paris is showing several
outstanding works - the first flower painting by Jan Brueghel the elder to
have come on to the market in many years, a mystically luminous 'Road to
Emmaus' by Paul Bril and 'Solomon and the Queen of Sheba' by Frans Francken.
colouring.
Mario Bellini from Florence, a friend of the late Paul Getty, is showing
Italian primitives alongside his personal collection of 16th century Italian
animal bronzes and a curiously elongated Venus by 15th century artist Paolo
Schiavo.
Giovanni Sarti from London also has Italian primitives prices at around
FFrs1m including a stark crucifixion by the 15th century Bolognese artist
Pietro di Giovanni Lianori, and three rare grisaille panels of sea monsters
by a contemporary of Mantegna's.
Michael Goedhuis from London, at Monte Carlo for the first time, is showing
ancient Chinese bronzes including two particularly fine wine containers - a
second century BC Han period, and a 3rd to 4th century BC Fang Hu model.
Resident Monaco dealers Ribolzi boast a pair of solid gold Puiforcat dinner
plates for FFrs200,000 and subtler objects such as a splendid rare lion
aquamanile from northern Germany circa 1200 and a late 18th century inkstand
made in the royal porcelain factory of Naples.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Coriolanus thrills Salzburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW regime at the Salzburg Festival, which took over at the start of the
decade, initiated changes affecting the style, presentation and - most
important - content of the operatic and musical offerings that are as yet by
no means absorbed all through. Bad-mouthing of the new administration
flourishes, intrigues simmer, the old guard continue to pray for the miracle
that will remove Gerard Mortier and resurrect Herbert von Karajan (or at the
very least a Karajan epigone).
On the other hand, Mortier's revitalisation of the festival's dramatic
component (importantly experimental under Max Reinhardt in the 1920s and
'30s, increasingly marginalised since) is already a fait accompli, and one
which is bearing rich fruit - in the Guardian the other day Michael
Billington proclaimed Salzburg as 'now Europe's major theatre festival'.
Peter Stein, drama overseer, set the tone with his Julius Caesar production
(new last year, revived this coming week) that simultaneously launched a
year-by-year examination of Shakespeare's Roman dramas and reclaimed the
Rocky Riding School as the most inspiring of theatrical spaces. He has also
found place for worthwhile new plays (this year Botho Strauss's Equilibrium,
widely acclaimed) and boldly risk-taking ventures (this year Peter Sellars
staging of Aeschylus's The Persians on the Perninsel near Hallein).
There is a buzz to the schedule of readings and related events - and,
indeed, a buzz to the whole theatre programme that contrasts sharply with
the still-to-be-clinched air of the musical. As my business was primarily
the latter, I could judge the former mainly from the sidelines; but my
single venture into drama-critics' territory, with the new Coriolanus,
afforded so thrillingly large-scaled an experience as almost to confirm in
itself everything that is being said about theatrical re-birth in the new
Salzburg order.
Deborah Warner, making her European debut, takes to the spaces of the Rocky
Riding School - with its vast, rough-hewn stage, colonnaded back wall and
sliding roof that can opened to the skies, all carved out of the Monchberg -
as though it were her native habitat. This is a cast-of-hundreds Coriolanus,
and its structure of entrances, exits and formations is founded with
spectacular virtuosity.
Mighty phalanxes of Romans and Volscians do battle, march, assemble and at
particularly stirring moments race along the heights with flaming torches.
The pit, where on my last visit James Levine and the Vienna Phil were
quartered for Die Zauberflote, plays home for a while to live horses before
they canter out to battle at Corioli. The sheer physicality of this
Coriolanus is at once exuberant, startling and disciplined.
It always is in a Warner show, whether it be her Elektra at the Riverside,
Wozzeck for Opera North or now this brilliant imagining of a harsh,
violence-riven landscape (given added poetic harshness by the rusty-red
textures of Hildegard Bechtler's screen-additions) against which this most
complete of Shakespearean analyses of the nature of human society and
government can be fleshed out. The physical force of the production -
wrested from the play out of Warner's twinned response to the text and the
chosen auditorium, lacking every element of spurious show - is matched by
the lean style of acting, which can yet find place for the remarkable,
memorable gesture.
Bruno Ganz in the title role is its exemplar and focal point: middle-aged,
sparing of movement, his voice capable of terrifying low chill, he can spit
out the Tieck translation (updated by Stein) with a vocal scything of the
air matched by a climactic command of the entire stage. I was constantly
electrified by the force of his presence. But the astonishing feature of
this Coriolanus is, indeed, the combination of intimacy and sudden grandeur
of all the acting (more astonishing for the fact that the director speaks no
German).
Whether it be the gloriously rounded Menenius of Hans Michael Rehberg, full
of lovable eccentricity covering a deep, pained humanity, or the darkly
fiery Aufidius of Daniel Friedrich (who, in a moment of horrifying verismo,
throws up in the midst of his defeat-enraged first-act furies), the ensemble
shows itself to possess a unified impulse in countless ways. Maria Wimmer's
Volumnia, in her mid-80s, suggests, in a brief, arresting moment of caress,
that the bond with her son, in his mid-50s, remains troubled, close-knit and
deep.
The disciplined vastness of the production gives all opposing sides opinions
their due: the experience becomes correspondingly more complex, searing,
universal. Without a doubt this tremendous Coriolanus was the high point of
my five-day stint.
Final performance at the Salzburg Felsenreitschule tonight

FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Time to dance - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING ballet on video is increasingly attractive as theatre tickets take
to the price stratosphere, and repertories and casting become duller by the
week. A look at the ballets and dancers on offer 20 years ago can provide a
sad comparison with the lack of directorial imagination and the midget
talents that beset dance today. Ballet is now beleaguered. There is a dearth
of new, vital classic choreography. How few are the starry names that can
set the groundlings in a roar.
The current and lately past seasons by the Royal Ballet and English National
Ballet are depressing in their lack of verve, their absence of authentic
ballerina performance. Until companies can lure audiences back with ballets
and artists worth the blood-chilling price of tickets, then dance-videos are
the best thing.
There is little new on the video market in ballet, though the many admirers
of Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Winter Dreams should watch for a forthcoming
recording from Warner Teldec with the original Royal ballet cast headed by
Irek Mukhamedov and Darcey Bussell. I give details herewith of available
recordings which have more than passing interest.
From Castle Communication Videos come three historic re-issues. For sheer
joy, and as a reminder of a company we see all too rarely, let me recommend
the Royal Danish Ballet's joyous Napoli (CVI 2056). Not to know this
enchanting piece is to be poor. To see it given with the gaiety of spirit
and buoyancy of step that the Danes bring to this ancestral treasure (they
have danced it uninterruptedly for 150 years) is to have life permanently
enriched. There is grand cast, led by Linda Hindberg and Arne Villumsen; the
mime roles are done with the proper Danish sensitivity and good humour. The
sun shines. Preben Montell directs with real affection for this dearest of
ballets.
For a glimpse of New York City Ballet - who will visit Europe, but not
Britain, next year - there is the marvel of Balanchine's Davidsbundlertanze
(CVI 2059), with its original cast. This late, elegiac masterpiece takes
Schumann's piano score as mirror of the composer's life. It says everything
about Balanchine as a romantic, and it is sublimely danced, with
interpretations by Suzanne Farrell and Karin von Aroldingen that stop the
heart. There is ideal direction by Merrill Brockway. And as a reminder of
the Bolshoi Ballet as it was during the summer of 1986, ebulliently under
canvas in Battersea Park, there is The Bolshoi Live: Divertissements (CVI
2052). We see a luminous Sylphides led by Bessmertnova, Semenyaka,
Semizorova, Alexey Fadeyechev - now there's a cast - and the second act of
Spartacus with Mukhamedov glorious at the head of roaring lines of slaves. A
final feu de joie brings all the company's then stars - and stars they
tremendously were - to dazzle us in bravura numbers, including the ecstatic
catch-as-catch-can of Spring Waters. (During that season I heard one member
of the audience call it Strong Waters. The truth will out). John Vernon's
sure direction preserves the excitement of those very happy evenings.
From Warner Teldec come two more recent videos of major productions.
MacMillan's Prince of the Pagodas is happily secure in a fine recording by
Derek Bailey. It offers the original cast (save for Simon Rice, who is
excellent as The Fool), and allows us to enjoy (which Covent Garden does
not) MacMillan's homage to Petipa, led by Darcey Bussell, Fiona Chadwick,
Jonathan Cope. Performances are uniformly excellent. Watching it, we are
made even more poignantly aware of how much our national ballet has lost
with MacMillan's death. As a postlude to the performance, we are shown Derek
Bailey's sympathetic documentary about the choreographer - Out of Line - in
which Sir Kenneth spoke so powerfully about his work.
The Nutcracker has been given more, and more curious, productions than any
other ballet I know. Rudolf Nureyev first staged it in 1967; thereafter he
re-worked it, and his last version was made for the Paris Opera Ballet. This
was recorded in 1988, with Nureyev directing the film. The result is a mixed
blessing. Performances are, as always with the Paris Opera, admirable:
Elizabeth Maurin can look convincingly child-like as Clara, but dances with
absolute authority and great charm; Laurent Hilaire, as Drosselmeyer/Prince
 -that's Nureyev for you - is elegant in manner and in bravura. An
incidental pleasure is the brilliance of Bruno Cauhape in the Mirlitons
divertissement. But the choreography is, characteristically, something of a
fidget, and the lighting has too many dreary, 40 watt moments, which give
the staging a sombre and un-festive air. A valuable view, nonetheless, of
the company and of Nureyev's classic ideals.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FOURTEEN SISTERS OF EMILIO MONTEZ O'BRIEN
by Oscar Hijuelos
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 484 pages
THE Pulitzer Prize jury got it right with Hijuelos's last novel; The Mambo
Kings Sing Songs Of Love appeared in 1989 and established itself as one of
the most sheerly enjoyable and skilful fictions of recent years. Its
exuberant romp through the life of an irrepressible musician was as much
celebration as invention: the New York world created by Hijuelos trembled on
the edge of fantasy, yet the magical elements were held in check by the
punctilious attention to detail and the richly lyrical force that ran
through the Mambo King's life and music.
The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is obviously the product of
the same generous imagination. The prose is always potent and alive, ever
alert to the physical image, the earthy description. To the Cuban-American
background in Mambo Kings is now added a dash of Irish blood: the 14 sisters
and their single brother are the progeny of an Irish father, Nelson O'Brien
of Cobbleton, Pennsylvania, photographer and owner of the Jewel Box Movie
Theater, and Cuban immigrant mother Mariela Montez. The unstoppable stream
of daughters creates its own diaspora: the eldest Margarita makes a loveless
but sexually demanding marriage, Carmen and Marta sell tickets at
Disneyland, Violeta marries a Presbyterian minister, Gloria works in Macy's;
all of them continue to dote upon their baby brother Emilio.
Though always vivid and engaging, the scheme is more ambitious but finally
not as convincing as Mambo Kings. It lacks the central thread, the single
larger-than-life character whose exploits can consistently thrill and repel
the reader in equal measure; it is much more picaresque, yet less
consistently entertaining. There is no single exotically dangerous world to
explore, just a snapshot sequence of more than a dozen very different lives,
some of them mundane, others glossy, glamorous.
The strands of Fourteen Sisters are bound together by the family background;
Hijuelos weaves his narrative texture out of that bundle of parallel
lifelines, sometimes making them converge, elsewhere allowing to plunge off
in solitary splendour. Emilio finds his way to 1950s Hollywood and carves
out a career as a B-movie star, until his penchant for teenage girls catches
up with him. What always anchors him to his home back East is his sisters,
and their teasing mixture of familial love and incestuous desire.
Emilio's story occupies a good third of the story - the perspective is
consistently a male one, the close descriptions of his sisters and each
women he meets lubriciously exact. He is not, though, the book's hero. If
there is one, it is surely Margarita, whose old age provides a moving coda
as effective and resonant as anything in the closing pages of Mambo Kings.
Hijuelos's knack of balancing sentiment and truthful emotion, voyeurism and
hard-edged description gives his fiction its tang; he is a strong, striking
voice, even if this is not his best book.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: The plots thicken in cold war thaw - Thrillers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS SUMMER has brought forth the usual crop of hardy annuals in the
thriller field. Tom Clancy, for instance, has produced Without Remorse
(HarperCollins Pounds 15.99, 639pp). This time, an extraordinarily complex
plot to do with personal errands of mercy is juxtaposed with a scheme by the
Pentagon to rescue prisoners from a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp.
Clancy can sustain a plot, however Byzantine, and this tome, although long,
does not sag.
Jack Higgins' new book, Thunder Point (Michael Joseph, Pounds 14.99,
309pp.), borders on the unacceptably implausible. It is very well-worked
territory - Martin Bormann's escape to South America at the end of the
second world war. This is apparently Higgins' 52nd novel and the whiskers
are beginning to show. But for aficionados, it is the usual racy mixture.
Two other long-familiar spy writers also have new offerings. Brian
Freemantle has written Charlie's Apprentice (Century Pounds 15.99, 435pp)
and Ted Allbeury The Line-Crosser (New English Library Pounds 15.99. 278
pp).
For a moment, in reading Brian Freemantle's book, I thought he was about to
kill off Charlie Muffin, his working-class at odds with the establishment
hero. I always found Charlie a poor clone of Len Deighton's Harry Palmer.
But no such luck. The apprentice of the title, personally trained by
Charlie, falls down on the job of trying to extract a British Agent from
Beijing, and our hero has to swing back into action, much to the dismay of
his superiors who thought they had got rid of him. Very much the mixture as
before. It rumbles along pleasantly enough.
Like Ted Allbeury, Freemantle is good on the detail of the intelligence
world; Allbeury is the more solemn of the two. The ending of the cold war
means the intelligence world is changing. Both Freemantle's and Allbeury's
books tackle the new situation in the former Soviet Union and its erstwhile
satellites. Several newish writers have set books in the former Soviet Union
where the decline of the Communist Party, the army and the KGB offers
fertile ground for adventure stories. The independent republics' rivalry
with Russia and the dominance of mafia-style gangs should also provide give
plenty of material.
Nik Gowing's The Loop (Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 312pp.) is concerned with an
Uzbek gang leader attempting to get control of Russia's dwindling supply of
gold. It is good on the former Soviet Union and has some fine vignettes of
the despair and desperation of people who have grown up within the system.
But the plot does not really sing.
The Third Trinity by Vitali Vitaliev and Derek Kartun (Hodder &amp; Stoughton
Pounds 15.99, 314pp) gives an interesting twist to the pre-eminence of the
gangs in the Soviet territories by hanging the story on the discovery of a
priceless icon: a third version of the Old Testament Trinity by Russia's
greatest icon painter, the Black Monk, Andrei Roublev.
This enables the authors to provide two tales for the price of one, since
there is skulduggery in the international art market and corruption in the
former Soviet Union. It is convincing - but less than compulsively
thrilling.
A third now-that-the-Soviet- Union-has-broken-up book is Darkness at Noon by
John Hands (Harper Collins Pounds 14.99. 236pp.) This is the paciest of the
three and it is all about destabilisation of the Ukraine by Russian agents.
Two of these three books have been written by journalists but it is
difficult to see the connection between a professional journalistic grasp of
the realities of a newly-opened up Soviet Union and a good thriller.
Frederick Forsyth probably has a lot to answer for - arguably he did the
worst disservice to journalists since Ernest Hemingway, because his crisp
style makes it all seem so simple and creates the impression that any hack
can write a best-seller and be free of the daily journalistic grind with one
bound.
Working journalists often have problems with getting the pace right. James
Adams is a case in point. His new novel, Taking the Tunnel (Michael Joseph
Pounds 9.99, 404pp) combines corruption in Hongkong with a Channel Tunnel
drama. Adams is described as a leading authority on covert warfare,
terrorism, weapons and international relations. I am sure he is, but in this
book the welter of specialist information acts as a brake on the action.
James Adams as also been described as the natural successor to Forsyth, but
if anybody qualifies on the evidence of the current spate of books it is
David Mason. Shadow Over Babylon (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 484pp) has been
much-hyped, and deservedly so. It is about a plot to assassinate Saddam
Hussein and is gripping from the word go. The writing is crisp and sharp.
The mise-en-scene is terrific. Even the sex scenes are not embarrassing.
Terence Strong's new book, Stalking Horse (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99,
369pp.) is also about the Gulf War. It is a pity it has to compete with
Shadow Over Babylon.
My find of the season. however, is Edna Buchanan. Her novel, Contents Under
Pressure (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 277pp) has as its heroine Britt
Montero, a crime reporter for a Miami newspaper. As she pursues an
apparently straightforward crime she becames embroiled in racial tensions
and riots.
Women detectives have become fashionable in US fiction lately. Crime and
corruption in deteriorating US cities have been fuelling some excellent
novelists, notably Elmore Leonard, George V. Higgins and Pete Dexter. Unlike
them, Edna Buchanan's forte is not so much the ear for dialogue but the
verisimilitude of her action descriptions and the almost Chandleresque
bathos of her professional and personal problems. This is the first of her
Britt Montero books.
Good.

THE WIESENTHAL FILE
by Alan Levy
Constable Pounds 18.95, 463 pages
ALTHOUGH Simon Wiesenthal, the most vigorous pursuer of Nazi murderers, has
published memoirs, this claims to be the first critical study of his life
and work. While much of it - the capture of Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires
in May 1960, the abortive hunt for Josef Mengele, the tangled mess of Kurt
Waldheim - is familiar territory, it has fresh strengths, not least the
interlacing of interviews with and reflections by Wiesenthal.
Levy writes with gentle respect and historical authority, whether dealing
with the appalling brutalities suffered by Jews, Gypsies, Poles, and all the
other 'sub-humans' subjected to Nazi violence, or the more recent
fratricidal conflicts within the leadership of the Jewish diaspora.
The latter is a rather more challenging task, since the actors and the
issues which divide them are mostly still alive. Levy's careful delineation
of the guerilla war between Wiesenthal and the World Jewish Congress is
naturally crammed with ironies. It is a thorny conflict which has detracted
from their central task, that of combatting anti-semitism.
Eichmann and the rest played Jew against Jew; it is almost incomprehensible
that, despite the absence of the paraphernalia of National Socialist power,
Jewish communities nevertheless manage to squabble bitterly amongst
themselves. It is shaming to all the key participants, Wiesenthal included;
courageously, Levy exonerates no-one.
But despite the petty rivalries over who did or did not get a Nobel peace
prize - the pugnacious Wiesenthal did not, the more diplomatic Elie Wiesel
did - Wiesenthal's story is compulsive reading.
He survived four years in different concentration camps, enduring beatings
and starvation. Once he was pulled out of a line of prisoners awaiting
bullets to the head; the next was for him. Almost his first experience after
being liberated by the US army was to be beaten up once again - this time by
a Polish future deputy minister of culture. All his family - 89 people -
died in the war, and he lost touch with his young wife early on. Yet she too
survived, and through a miracle they were reunited in the refugee chaos of
1945.
It would be unfair to criticise this book for failing to consider the
lingering riddle of what conjunction of events created the climate that
allowed the Nazis to conduct genocide. Yet that riddle is still at the heart
of this subject.
Living in Poland in the 1980s (Wiesenthal was born in Galicia), I often
tried, and always failed, to learn why the nation most scarred by the
Holocaust - and, apart from the former USSR, the most dubious in its
post-war treatment of its Jewish communities - was still so permeated by
anti-semitism, a feature which of course was denied at every opportunity,
both officially and otherwise.
I once quizzed an ethnically Jewish but by religion Roman Catholic Polish
friend. Why did Poles still hate Jews so much? Wearily, his shoulders and
said, 'Why not?'. It was, he implied, absurd to seek rational answers in an
irrational context.
But the question needs to be put, endlessly. It cannot be dispelled, even by
embarrassment, tempting though that is. ('Boy, they sure were big on
crematoriums, weren't they?' said George Bush during a visit to Auschwitz as
US vice president in 1987.) Nor can it be evaded, as Eichmann attempted in
his notorious (and possibly apocryphal) comment: 'A hundred dead people is a
catastrophe. Six million dead is a statistic.'
Wiesenthal has lived a requiem. He has always denied that he was motivated
by hatred, claiming only to have sought justice. This year he will be 85. He
can have no finer interpreter and sympathiser than Alan Levy, who has dealt
justly with him.

A VIEW TO A DEATH IN THE MORNING
by Matt Cartmill
Harvard Pounds 23.95, 331 pages
I HATE hunting and huntsmen. At least I think I do. Certainly I hate
violence. And the thought of killing things - foxes, game-birds, polar
bears, people - makes me glow with fury. I believe that huntsmen are
primitives: viciously non-intelligent throw-backs to the time when our
ancestors first came down from the trees. I believe them to be prisoners of
the same gorily malfunctioning maleness that leads to wars and death camps.
If you ask me, they have grievous sexual hang-ups. I would like to stamp on
their faces, shoot them, poison them, spear them and boil them up.
On the other hand, I am in the grip of the notion that humans are only
animals: that we are only chimpanzees and that we have a long way to go,
evolutionarily speaking, before our achievements and our traits signify any
real divergence from the rest of the animal kingdom. It follows, from this,
that although I hate huntsmen - would like to stab and gas them - I somehow
absolve them: they are prisoners of their genes.
Confusing? Then you ought to read this excellent book, to discover just how
confusing the subject of hunting and human nature really is.
Matt Cartmill is a professor in the department of biological anthropology
and anatomy at Duke University in the US, and his book a brilliantly
well-realised study of the connections that have been drawn between hunting
and being human.
As he states at the outset: 'It deals above all with the hunting hypothesis
of human origins, which is the story of how some apes became human when they
took up weapons and began to kill. The killer-ape story has roots in older
tales, and so this book is in part a literary history. But it is also a book
about science, because scientists have been the chief tellers of that
story.' The professor starts his story near its end, by tracing the rise and
ascendancy of the hunting hypothesis - our notion of homo sapiens as lunatic
killer apes - in anthropological thought after the end of the second world
war. The hypothesis collapsed during the 1970s, and Cartmill asks why such a
flimsy story, with such unpalatable implications, was accepted for so long.
'What do we get out of seeing ourselves as sick, disordered animals - and
why should anyone think that the origins of our sickness are somehow tied to
hunting?'
His arguments - and answers - cover Greek myth and literature; the impact of
Christian revisionism; the emergence, in the Renaissance, of the view of the
hunt as symbol of tyranny and object of moral indignation; the link, from
the 17th century, between the growth of anti-hunting sentiment and the
growth of science; the blurring of boundaries between people and beasts; the
Romantic reaction against science; the Darwinian view of nature as - in fact
 -a struggle for existence (cited as a justification for hunting); and the
'Bambi syndrome' - fear of war mingled with Romantic reverence for nature
and Freudian pessimism about man.
At the end, the good professor expresses doubts about the meaning and
reality of the distinctions we draw between artifice and nature, and between
people and animals.
Was hunting really an important factor in human origins? The author says it
is a safe bet that hunting assumed an increased importance during the course
of our evolution from our chimpanzee-like ancestors. But he says there is
nothing to imply that hunting made us human.
On the other hand: 'Even if hunting does not have the causal importance that
anthropologists once attributed to it, it may still be linked to some
essential human taint, some fundamental disorder or sickness that makes the
human condition peculiarly tragic or dangerous. If so, we ought not to
disregard the myth of the killer ape.'
Professor Shipman is justifiably regarded as an extremely important
evolutionary essayist - one whose hallmarks are erudition, stylishness, wit
and piercing humanity. He really is a good chimpanzee.
In five days' time, members of the numskull upper English and Scottish
class, their grubby clients in tow, will be poncing across the moorland and
cocking their firearms for the 'Glorious Twelfth' - the start of the
grouse-shooting season. The experience will cost them a fortune. For a
fraction of the cost, they could buy this book and start to get an
education. But I don't suppose they will.

BRITISH JEWRY AND THE HOLOCAUST
by Richard Bolchover
Cambridge Pounds 22.95, 208 pages
A MEMBER of a young generation of British Jews, Richard Bolchover is harshly
critical of the Anglo-Jewish community and its response to the Holocaust,
arraigning in particular its leaders for what he perceives as their
pusillanimity, self-indulgent preoccupation with petty communal and personal
conflict, and their 'phobia about anti-semitism - a neurosis which at times
verged on self-hatred'.
Disregarding a substantial record of Jewish interventions, some quite public
and many behind the scenes, he argues that the Jewish community, never more
than one per cent of the total population of the UK, was throughout the
Hitler era ineffectual and timid in its representations to the British
government, paralysed between the 'politics of hope' and the 'politics of
fear', unable to mobilise any rescue efforts of its own, or to exert
effective pressure to help European Jewry. This was because of its failure
to comprehend the disaster unfolding on the Continent, and above all because
it was shackled by the values of an insecure minority concerned at all costs
to avoid being perceived as different from the non-Jewish majority, except
in matters of religious observance.
For the author, only such non-conformists as Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld and the
Zionist Revisionist fraction reacted appropriately to the emergency,
campaigning loudly for concrete rescue work and the recruitment of a Jewish
fighting force - efforts which were largely ignored or disavowed by the
official Jewish leadership, and in the event also bore little fruit.
Bolchover's argument, which he concedes is made from hindsight, is based
almost entirely on Jewish community sources, especially the Jewish press,
and as such is fatally flawed: the Jewish community's response to the
Holocaust, its fear of anti-Semitism, cannot be appropriately assessed
without some reflection on the surrounding reality.
One would never know from this study that there was, in fact, significant
anti-Semitism in wartime Britain, increasing in intensity as the war ground
on and Jewish terrorism in Palestine began to take its toll of British
military and civilian personnel; or that the German Jewish refugees, highly
visible in a much more homogeneous and insular Britain than Bolchover would
recognise, were likely to be targets for residual anti-German xenophobia
from the first World War as well as anti-Semitic feeling.
Consulting private papers, or indeed surviving individuals, might have
enabled the author to produce a more useful work, that in addition to baring
the unedifying record of communal strife and business-as-usual could have
reported what the community managed to accomplish in helping to succour at
least some of their fellow-Jews. The British Jewish community lived and
worked, hoped and feared, in a context: but there is no discussion of that
context.
In a notably condescending conclusion, Bolchover alleges that British Jews
'had neither collective self-esteem nor a sense of being in control of their
own lives', with the result that they were averse to taking risks and
incapable of self-assertion in facing the Holocaust. Such a breathtaking
charge, with its inapposite echoes of pop psychology, is simply unproven by
the preceding argument, and does nothing to advance our understanding of
those who had to live and act in a time of tragically limited options.

BLASPHEMY
by David Lawton
Harvester Wheatsheaf, 242 pages
IF I impugn your God or gods, in your view I blaspheme. So if an alien comes
to a Christian country and tells its devout citizens that their belief in
virgin birth, miracles, resurrection and so forth, is codswallop, and that
they should instead bow down before the horned toad as the true incarnation
of deity, that alien would be branded a blasphemer. The alien, of course,
would retort the charge on his accusers' heads. And so it would go on, until
either he or they were reduced to cinders at some convenient stake.
David Lawton begins his study of blasphemy with the claim, surely right,
that it is not possible to give a straightforward definition of blasphemy.
Blasphemy comes into existence when something that someone says or writes
gives a special kind of offence to someone else, the offence typically
consisting in a perceived insult to something cherished as divine. But it
depends on cases; and it always takes two - a giver and a receiver of
offence - to make blasphemy possible.
It was the Rushdie fatwa which prompted Lawton to write this book, but
although he devotes a chapter to that tragic affair it is not his main
topic. Rather, he offers a history of the concept of blasphemy in the
Western world, aiming to illuminate its complexity so that we can better
understand the painful conflicts it generates. And he also addresses the
practical question whether our own blasphemy laws should be extended to
cover other religions, or abolished altogether.
We gain insights into the concept of blasphemy by looking at examples of its
application. Lawton lavishly supplies us with fascinating and entertaining
case histories, three of them given at length in the opening chapter. One
concerns Susannah Fowles, a 17th-century woman fined and pilloried because,
as anonymous accusers alleged, she 'blasphemed Jesus Christ and cursed the
Lord's Prayer'. To us she seems merely a frightened girl harassed by stupid
people.
Another case concerns the poet Charles Sedley, who drunkenly stripped naked
and preached a blasphemous anti-sermon from an ale-house balcony. He was
fined Pounds 500, a vast sum for 1663. The third is the story of the Italian
miller Menocchio, brilliantly told in Carlo Ginzburg's classic The Cheese
and the Worms and repeated here by Lawton. Menocchio perished at the stake
in 1600 for denying the virginity of Mary and the divinity of Jesus.
Menocchio had his own theology, which Ginzburg painstakingly reconstructs;
but because it was not the theology of the Inquisition, Menocchio burned.
These cases show, Lawton argues, that blasphemy 'exists as an interchange'.
It is the product of a conflict between perceptions. On this basis he
explores the diffusion of thought about blasphemy in early, medieval and
Reformation Christianity to see how the concept developed, citing a wealth
of further cases in illustration.
In the second half of the book Lawton turns to recent concerns. On the legal
question he concludes, in my view rightly, that blasphemy laws should be
abolished. From the examples he cites it emerges clearly that these laws,
like those relating to obscenity and censorship, are simply instruments for
controlling ideas. He therefore argues against them, asserting that
blasphemy is 'healthy' because it is a sign of free speech and because it
demonstrates the maturing of an intellectual community from one level of
belief and practice to another.
It would be a mistake, Lawton warns us, to think that controversies over
blasphemy are on the whole dying out. It is a Freudian idea that religion,
like perversion, is a precultural phenomenon, belonging to the infancy of
mankind. But although Freud opposed religion as a sinister force that must
be defeated - Lawton characterises Freud as a 'master blasphemer' in this
sense - the threat of conflict always lurks. And this indeed is shown in
what Lawton describes as a rehearsal for the Gulf War: the Rushdie affair,
representing the very clash of perceptions and responses from which
blasphemy controversies arise.
Blasphemy is a destructive idea, a dangerous, subjective catch-all used by
superstitiously besotted people to deny others their liberty of thought. The
world would be a better place if the notion were purged from it. Given the
richness and value of the case studies and the strong arguments Lawton
offers, his book should be required reading, although it is a pity that it
is written in literary-critical jargon of a kind to set one's teeth on edge.

gathered at the Cheshire Cheese

<TEXT>
LONDON IN THE 1890s: A CULTURAL HISTORY
by Karl Beckson
W W Norton Pounds 19.95, 455 pages
PURITANS first began to give their children 'virtue' names - Faith, Hope,
Charity - in Elizabethan England. For boys the virtue name that came into
favour as appropriate to the Empire-building Victorian male in the last
quarter of the 19th century was Ernest - an English form of the German
Ernst, 'earnestness, vigour'. Apart from Wilde's pair of Ernests, revealing
the precise opposite of these attributes, there were two notable Ernests in
real life among the literati.
Ernest Rhys and Ernest Dowson were both members of The Rhymers' Club, fin de
siecle poets who met periodically at the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street to
recite their verses while quaffing ale. These meetings and the anthologies
the Rhymers published are rescued from oblivion in this informative book on
literary movements in London at the end of the Victorian period by the
American scholar Karl Beckson, professor of English at Brooklyn College.
The name quite suited Rhys, to whom we owe that earnest publishing venture,
Everyman's Library; it still survives and last year celebrated its 100th
anniversary with many new volumes. Ernest did not work quite so well as a
name for Dowson. His claim to posthumous fame is that he wrote 'Cynara' - a
poem that recalls his debauched experiences with a prostitute ('I have
forgot much Cynara] . . . Flung roses, riotously with the throng;/ Dancing
to put thy pale lost lilies out of mind . . .'). But we remain indebted to
him too. His poem provided Margaret Mitchell with the title for her novel
Gone With The Wind; and its line 'I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in
my fashion . . .' gave Cole Porter the refrain for one of his best numbers
in Kiss Me Kate.
Dowson's sentiments epitomise not earnestness but decadence, one of the
chief moods and modes of the period. Decadence was a devastating hurricane
that blew across the Channel from France. If there were some Franco-sceptics
among the men of letters of the 1890s who resisted it, most of them were
committed to a common literary currency with their Gallic counterparts. They
aspired to that 'de-regulation of all the senses' advocated by the likes of
Verlaine, Rimbaud, Baudelaire. Beckson documents the progress of decadence
as a reaction against industrialism and materialism; it gave rise to
movements like aestheticism and symbolism, the precursors of Modernism. The
development of Yeats, a leading member of the Rhymers' Club, sums this up.
Oscar Wilde was not a member of the Rhymers' Club but he was a charter
member of a closely associated society started by Yeats, the Southwark Irish
Literary Club, some of whose meetings were hosted in the Cheshire Cheese by
the Rhymers. Wilde delivered the death blow to Ernest as a virtue-name in
his comedy. But, Beckson suggests, there was in the title a pun within a
pun. Ernest is a play on a more esoteric term - Uranist - coined at this
period by a German lawyer, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, a homosexual who wrote
books proving that homosexuality was congenital, hence natural.
Wilde described his love of boys as Uranian. When, for instance, after
prison he went to live with Bosie in Naples, he justified himself in a
letter of 1898 to Robbie Ross like this: 'It is very unfair of people being
horrid to me about Bosie and Naples. A patriot put in prison for loving his
country loves his country, and a poet in prison for loving boys loves boys.
To have altered my life would have been to have admitted that Uranian love
is ignoble. I hold it to be noble - more noble than other forms.'
Wilde was not the only gay poet to make a pun on Ernest and Uranist. In 1892
there appeared a volume of poems Love in Earnest by John Gambril Nicholson
containing a sequence of 50 love-sonnets addressed to a 14-year-old boy. In
The Importance . . . the joke is kept strictly under wraps, but occasionally
it peeps out as when in Act II Gwendolen tells Cicely: 'The home seems to me
to be the proper sphere for a man. And certainly once a man begins to
neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate does he not? And
I don't like that. It makes men so very attractive.'
Beckson is a bloodhound who sniffs out gay innuendo in the most unlikely
parts of the text. Jack Worthing tells Lady Bracknell that his house in
Belgrave Square is let to Lady Bloxham. Beckson points out that Bosie had a
young friend up at Oxford, John Francis Bloxom, who edited a Uranian
magazine The Chameleon to which Wilde contributed a series of 'Phrases and
Philosophies for the Use of the Young' and to which Bloxom, under the
pseudonym X, contributed a story about a pederastic Roman Catholic priest
and his altar-boys.
The magazine did not survive its first issue. It may give point to Lady
Bracknell's observation that Lady Bloxham's advanced age 'was no guarantee
of respectability'. Beckson deals with many ephemeral anthologies of this
kind as well as those well-known ones, The Yellow Book and The Savoy,
embellished with Beardsley's decadent homoerotic illustrations.
There was bound to be a backlash and it came not just with Wilde's downfall
but with the publication in 1895 in translation from the German of Max
Nordau's study Degeneration. Nordau equated decadence with degeneration,
seeing them both as a kind of criminality inherent in certain types and
races - and we all know what that unfortunate theory led to. The book's
sentiments were echoed by anti-decadents like the poet WE Henley, an
influential editor and friend of RL Stevenson.
Then Shaw instigated a backlash against the backlash in his essay 'A
Degenerate's View of Nordau', later published in a revised form as The
Sanity of Art. What is remarkable about Beckson's study - apart from its
wealth of learning - is its revelation of how many of the crucial concerns
of art and literature in our own period originated in the 1890s.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Motoring: Xantia will drive off with the awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF CITROEN fails to win Europe's prestigious Car of the Year competition
with its Xantia, it ought to fly a banner over its head office in Paris
saying: 'We were robbed.'
Picking a Car of the Year winner two months before the jury votes might seem
as chancy as picking a Derby winner two months before the off. But, having
driven the short-odds favourites like the Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall (Opel) Corsa
and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, as well as the Xantia, I think the Citroen is a
racing cert. It certainly should be, although Car of the Year juries can be
as unpredictable and perverse as those in courts of justice.
Why am I so sure? I suppose that because each time I drive the Xantia, I
like it better. This is not so with all new cars. Some do not live up to
favourable first impressions. The left-hand drive 1.8- and two-litre Xantias
I tried in Spain last February before the car's official debut rode and
handled beautifully, looked elegant and had lots of room inside. But I
thought the 1.8 sounded a bit buzzy at 80 mph (130 kmh) and 4,000 rpm.
The right-hand 1.8 I drove for nearly 500 miles (800 kms) in Britain last
month was significantly quieter although I still have reservations about low
gearing. Does one's motorway driving at business user speeds have to be at
4,000 rpm-plus (as it was, incidentally, in the admirable Ford Mondeo
two-litre Ghia estate I have just used for an enjoyable week)? I don't think
so.
The up-side of the low gearing is that it makes the Xantia - and Mondeo -
extraordinarily flexible. Both accelerate smoothly in top gear from 25 mph
(35 kmh). But driving the turbo-diesel version last week removed any
lingering doubts that the Xantia should become Car of the Year 1994.
The 92 horsepower, 1.9-litre turbo-diesel produces more torque (pulling
power) at far lower revolutions than even the most muscular (155 horsepower)
16-valve, two-litre petrol engine. So the Xantia TD has been given taller
gearing (25.3 mph/40.7 kmh per 1,000 rpm in fifth) against just over 20 mph
(32 kmh) for the petrol-engined models.
For a diesel, it is unnervingly quiet; so quiet that you forget it is a
diesel when on the move. Even when idling in traffic, the only reminder is a
remote sort of chuckle from under the bonnet.
Figures show the TD out-performs the 1.6i petrol but not the 1.8i. But there
is more to performance in the real world than brutally-obtained, standing
start acceleration times and maximum speeds which are illegal and unusable.
It is the pulling power of the 1.9-litre turbo-diesel at modest revolutions
that makes it the most agreeably driveable Xantia of all. At 80 mph (130
km), it whispers along at a shade over 3,000 rpm compared with a
petrol-engined Xantia's near-4,000. Yet, pick-up from 50-70 mph (80-128 kmh)
is so strong that the Xantia TD accelerates in top gear up hills that would
demand a downward change in many other cars of moderately high gearing.
The non-turbo Xantia diesel is less vigorous: 99 mph/159 kmh maximum against
the turbo's 111 mph/179 kmh, and a standing-start kilometre in 38.2 seconds
(34.4 secs). But it runs as smoothly and quietly and promises even better
economy, averaging 44.6 mpg (6.32 l/100 km) against the turbo's 43 mpg (6.57
l/100 km).
For many buyers, the price will be the clincher. At Pounds 10,895, the 1.9D
costs the same as the petrol entry model, the 1.6i, which makes it a
bargain. The cheapest turbo-diesel, the Xantia TD LX, is Pounds 12,795.
Diesel car sales in Britain are rising. Last year, 200,000 were sold and, at
the beginning of this year, the industry estimated a rise to 225,000 in
1993. But this has been overtaken by events. Between January and the end of
June, 141,974 (16.92 per cent of the market) diesel cars were registered
compared with 87,276 (11.35 per cent) in the first six months of 1992. In
this month's L-registration sales rush, mainly by private buyers, diesel's
market share is expected to climb higher still.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Gardening: Violas - many virtues, few vices - Robin Lane Fox
is already planning next year's display of his most useful plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are lost in all the financial turmoil, try pansy futures instead.
They are not the new financial instrument of a progressive local authority;
they are a way into the best additions to my gardening life. The best of
them will flower for months, persist for ages and bring the range of soft
colours which a garden of any size can accommodate. In spite of previous
visits to this column, they still seem to elude gardeners who will go to any
lengths to grow potted jasmine and cultivate their own parsley.
Perhaps they are foxed by the timetable of their best supplier. Hence, the
need for pansy futures: the best violas have to be booked up to nine months
in advance. I have just received the latest catalogue at a time when violas
are needing one of their rare periods of attention. This weekend, pen and
scissors are poised for action.
Alert visitors to Chelsea Flower Show will know already that the best violas
come from Richard Cawthorne, of Lower Dalton Nursery, Swanley Village,
Swanley, Kent BR87 NU. Cawthorne does not receive visitors and only takes
orders in advance. The new catalogue is available and you have until the end
of October to send for your selections.
He will then take cuttings from the stock plants and invoice you early next
year when he knows the numbers available. In April, he sends out excellent
plants, well rooted in proper earth so that they grow away and flower
promisingly in their first season. There is no risk in ordering them unseen:
all the plants begin in the same way, at the same date. You get what
everyone else is getting, and the packing is admirable.
The best value is not necessarily the best-known. People seem to think
pansies should be universal or one of those large-flowered forms, grown
yearly from seed. Violas, on the other hand, should be quaint or
old-fashioned. Among violas, people go for green-black flowers on Molly
Sanderson, the lavender-pink of Nellie Britten or the yellow and chocolate
markings of Jackanapes, which Gertrude Jekyl named after her pet monkey.
I began in the same way and cursed the results. None of these old varieties
seems to last for more than two years, whereupon they fizzle out. The right
course is to follow the Cawthorne catalogue, forget about curious colourings
and build up a basic stock of the forms which he marks with a special
symbol. He ought to know. He holds the National Collection and has bred
dozens of varieties himself.
The line between a pansy and a viola is rather arbitrary on the margins of
his long list. Where possible, he prefers the smaller-flowered forms which
have greater vigour and less pansy blood. He has also expanded into the wild
species forms, though not, as yet, into the desirable canadensis and the
late-flowering striata, both of which were favourites of that fastidious
expert, E A Bowles.
I have two favourite groups. The first are the various forms of Viola
cornuta which extend from an excellent white to a good sky-blue. All of them
are easy and are particularly welcome because their habit is to trail, so
that they can be trained among taller plants in a border.
They grow well in slight shade or in the company of a mixed border, and so
long as they are kept clipped and watered they will grow for anybody. In a
lightly-shaded London garden, they remain my first choice at ground level,
although few Londoners seem to display them. They are excellent at ground
level in one of those typically square beds in a front garden which
otherwise runs to straggly Tea roses.
Down a different line of family, we find the many-named varieties which
include Cawthorne's own creations. My top six, after wide experiment, are
Rebecca, Fiona, pure white Morwenna, pale yellow Beshlie, silvery-lilac
Maggie Mott and the amazing Inverurie Beauty. Other forms are as
well-coloured but they lack the same stamina. Inverurie Beauty arose long
ago in Scotland and it remains the most rewarding plant in my entire garden.
It bears flowers on long stems from early spring until autumn if you leave
it uncut.
In 1992, its violet flowers appeared with me for 11 months out of 12; they
took two months' holiday and this year they have resumed their continuity
since March. One plant will multiply with the greatest ease from any sort of
cuttings or divisions in springtime. The Inverurie blood-line has been bred
into other forms, one of which has been shown for the first time by
Cawthorne at this year's Chelsea.
The point about these violas is that they flower madly and make the most
obliging carpets of soft colour. I use them all over the place and find them
reliable if I follow the Cawthorne rules.
This weekend, the most important comes into action. The plants are still in
full flower but you must harden your heart and cut all their long stems
right back to a central cluster, the base for future growth. People who lose
their violas after one good flowering are omitting or mistiming this
necessary job. If they are cut now, they make a nest of short young stems
which will then come easily through winter.
The second Cawthorne rule is to spray regularly against greenfly. Phostrogen
now produces an organic spray against greenfly which will satisfy green
consciences and dissatisfy green insects. Cawthorne also recommends a spray
with Benlate after planting in order to guard against the dreaded pansy
sickness. The chances of catching it are slim and you should not conclude
from all these rules that violas are in any way temperamental.
To prove it, I can look back on 12 years of happy life with them, counting
my original plants of the cornuta varieties of which I have taken hundreds
of cuttings. What they all like is a good feeding with a liquid fertiliser,
applied through a hose throughout the early summer.
If they are fed and watered, they will also refute a widespread myth. Like
so much else, violas are believed to be plants which need shade or a cool
position in front of shrubs. What they really need is enough water. Often,
the shade will be dry under trees or a wall and the taller shrubs will take
away the moisture. Some of my best ones grow in light shade but others are
as old and almost as happy in the open on stony soil. The enemy is drought,
not sunshine. The same is true of violets which modern mythology also
banishes into the shadows.
Violets have never been better grown than by the great French suppliers to
the cut-flower trade at the turn of the century. The best of these suppliers
insisted on the importance of hot sun to ripen the crowns and to induce the
fullest flowering.
Violas do not have the same sort of crown as violets but they are equal
kings in their family. People who fail with them forget to cut them or to
keep up with the best varieties, many of which have just been bred for new
vigour. Often, especially in early June, I look round my ever-expanding
flowerbeds and wonder what is making the semblance of a good show. Again and
again, the answer is a single big plant of a viola, the best value for
civilised gardeners and one in which you can deal safely this month.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Sport: Women cricketers revive the old values - At Lord's,
Teresa McLean enjoyed a nostalgic day of stroke play, good behaviour and
English victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE WERE on holiday in France when we saw an English newspaper with news of
the Tories' defeat at Christchurch and England's defeat at Headingley, both
by awesome amounts. There was an air of inevitability about these results,
which was why it was so nice to go to Lord's last Sunday with a sense of
uncertainty, indeed a twinge of national hope.
There was no reason England should lose the Women's World Cup final to New
Zealand. It was the kind of sensation I had not felt since 1991, when
England managed to draw the series with the West Indies and the nation
celebrated Graham Gooch and Derek Pringles' victorious trudge off the
Headingley pitch in the drizzle. It felt lovely.
On Sunday there were about 4,000 spectators at Lord's, including two men who
had flown from New Zealand to watch their countrywomen play and were much
elated by their trouncing of the old Australian enemy in the semi-finals.
Compared with that, everything else was peanuts.
Even so, only the Test match drew a bigger Sunday crowd to Lord's this
summer: a compliment to the Women's World Cup, which attracted a lot of
interest, and a dim reflection on the Sunday venture into brightly-coloured
hit-and-run, which people have not been flocking to watch.
This was old-fashioned, white-clothed, blue-blazered cricket played in a
sporting spirit. It was only when one of England's pace bowlers (about
fast-medium by men's standards), Suzie Kitson, put on the bright blue hat
she had lost in a burst of ferocious fielding that I even noticed what the
players were wearing.
No-one made bad jokes about the divided skirts and long white socks because
the cricket was much more interesting. For one thing, it was keen. Each side
got through its 60 overs quickly and enthusiastically. I used to play
cricket, so I was not at all surprised to see how well these women played,
but I was surprised and impressed to see New Zealand bowl 45 overs in the
two hours 15 minutes before lunch.
There was not one no-ball all day. Bowlers marched, fielders and umpires
trotted back to their marks. When England's left-handed all-rounder, Jo
Chamberlain, was sent in early to speed up the scoring, she and right-handed
Barbara Daniels knocked up 57 in 53 balls, punctuated by flurries of
adjustment in the field every time the batting changed from left to
right-handed.
Chamberlain bats and bowls left but throws right-handed, leaving a trail of
confusion in her wake. It is relatively common to bat with one hand and bowl
with the other, but Hampshire's Kevan James is the only man I can think of
on the county circuit who bats and bowls with his left and throws with his
right, as Chamberlain did on Sunday. Chamberlain ran out Debbie Hockley, New
Zealand's top run-scorer in the World Cup, for 24 with a brilliant,
unexpected right-handed throw from the covers.
Splendidly umpired by Val Williams and Judith West, the game was played with
an abundance of hand-shaking and good behaviour. New Zealand were so pleased
to have reached the final that they may even have been a bit too helpful to
England. Their captain is one of the Illingworth clan, born in Lancaster,
now a police officer in South Island.
She is naturally competitive but it never occurred to her when she won the
toss that by putting England in to bat she might be giving them a nice
start. Some of the World Cup games had been played on grim pitches, like the
one at Beckenham on which New Zealand shot out Australia for only 77, a
total they then reached without loss as the sun dried out the damp.
On their way to the final, New Zealand developed a fixed preference for
batting second. Women's cricket in New Zealand is a tough business but used
to good conditions. Last September, it amalgamated with men's cricket to
form New Zealand Cricket (Inc), and the kind of second-class conditions
enjoyed by English female cricketers came as a nasty surprise.
Unfortunately for the New Zealanders, England were delighted to bat first.
Both Janette Brittin, with 48, and Carole Hodges, with 45, were unlucky to
fall short of their half-centuries, batting with absolute correctness.
Brittin's boundaries included a series of deft leg glances and late cuts.
The women's ball is 0.5 oz lighter than the men's, and they cannot hit it as
hard. In order to score fast, two of the first skills they learn are
straight hitting and good timing. Even so, when 42 overs had gone and there
were only 100 runs on the board, Chamberlain was sent in to add a bit of
muscle. She was bowled all ends up 33 balls later, with 38 robust runs to
her credit, having established herself as the crowd's favourite the moment
she began to wield her bat.
She has more sparkle than skill. The glamorous West Indian next to me stood
up in the sunshine and shook her mammoth ear-rings to celebrate every time
Chamberlain hit the ball. I hope they were clip-on ear-rings.
New Zealand had one other problem. Their fielders, like England's, were fast
and efficient over the ground, but unlike England's they dropped their
catches. I saw New Zealand drop five reasonably easy catches, including one
of Chamberlain's wilder pulls and a mis-hit by Hodges when she had only 29.
England's Suzie Kitson, by contrast, removed opener Kirstie Bond with a
truly sensational, airborne catch in the gully.
Adhesive catching and mean bowling (Clare Taylor 12 overs, two for 27; Karen
Smithies 12 overs, one for 14; Chamberlain 12 overs, three for 29) made
England's total of 195 look increasingly inaccessible and the later stages
of New Zealand's batting hopelessly frantic. They were all out for 128,
England quick to clap them off and share a beer.
Much women's cricket in Britain is informal, small-scale and, as it were,
unestablished. All of it is resplendently amateur. Women held their first
World Cup two years before men, in England in 1973, and are old hands at
managing on a little. Among the patrons thanked by the Women's Cricket
Association for help with this World Cup were many private individuals,
sports associations as varied as MCC and Copdock Cricket Club, and a wide
range of firms and unions.
But how could industry stand back when England's star players include a
deputy manager at Coral Racing (captain and all-rounder Smithies); a sales
support administrator with British Airways (opening bat and brilliant
fielder Brittin); a bank clerk (No 3 bat, off-spinner and close fielder
Hodges); and a van driver with Mann Egerton (fast medium bowler, fast bat,
expert fielder and man (]?]) of the match Chamberlain)?

FT  07 AUG 93 / Property: Pricey but desirable, that's Switzerland - And
since restrictions can make it difficult for foreigners to buy homes, make
sure to get yourself a good lawyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WITH the Swiss application to join the EC on freeze
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'we have not withdrawn it and we have not activated it,' says the country's
embassy in London - the prospect of Switzerland becoming a member in the
next few years seems remote. Thus, any large-scale relaxation of the
restrictions on foreigners buying property is unlikely.
In spite of this, London solicitor Simon Malster - whose firm, Osbornes,
sells Swiss property to foreign buyers - says he feels the restrictions have
added greatly to the country's attraction for buyers of second homes.
'Switzerland has effectively maintained its exclusivity, high standard of
living and quality of life,' he says.
Malster adds that although property prices may have dipped in some of
Switzerland's major cities, they have not done so in popular resorts like
Villars (in the canton of Valais). He stresses that people who buy there
tend to be virtually recession-proof and that a market for the country's
leisure homes exists throughout the world.
Random choices from Osbornes' list in Villars include a two-bedroom chalet
apartment, where you can ski to your back door, for Pounds 169,400, or a
duplex apartment with three double bedrooms at Pounds 202,000.
Both can be occupied immediately. For the bargain-hunter, there is the
Residence Dauphin: a four-bedroom apartment on two floors in a 200-acre
private estate, also at Villars. Construction is 'excellent' but the inside
needs updating. Price: Pounds 230,000.
Only a handful of agents in Britain offers Swiss property regularly. Among
them is Hilary Scott Overseas, which produces information sheets about some
of the many regulations governing property purchases by foreigners - an
almost impossible task since they vary from canton to canton and change
often. But the rules also seem flexible, and a good Swiss lawyer is the
first essential.
A foreigner may buy only one property. He cannot sell for five years (unless
in exceptional circumstances) and must then sell only to a Swiss resident.
After 10 years, though, he can apply for a permit to sell to another
foreigner.
Quotas are issued for the number of properties authorised for sale to
foreigners each year: for 1991/1992, it was 1,420. The total is divided
between the cantons, some of which may not take up their allocation.
Certain cantons (often those where German is spoken) virtually are closed to
non-Swiss buyers so there are more opportunities to purchase in French (or
perhaps Italian) speaking areas. But foreigners may only buy a percentage of
apartments in any one building. Mortgages, at about 7.5 per cent, should be
available from Swiss banks. Legal fees and transfer tax come to about 5.5
per cent of the purchase price.
Swiss property prices have been rising on average by 5-7 per cent a year.
They may appear high, says Hilary Scott, but the Swiss found it unthinkable
to build to anything but the best standards. On top of that, the country has
political and economic stability with good medical care, transport and
general services - and that healthy climate.
Hilary Scott has a choice of properties in Villars, including a development
of 25 studio to three-bedroom apartments in the centre. Prices range from
Pounds 72,000 to Pounds 455,000, with occupations from Christmas. Owners
will be able to use the services and pool in a hotel across the road. So
far, a third of purchasers have been British but the Swiss also are buying
there - something to note should you need to re-sell.
This agency can offer rental and management services and deal with lettings.
It says: 'As a guideline, if a property is rented for 15 to 18 weeks a year,
one can expect a return of about 2 per cent over the annual cost.'
Villas Abroad (Properties) has a spread of locations and prices for its
Swiss holiday homes. There are plenty of re-sales, which probably will be
cheaper than new, but these can present problems and may require a degree of
patience. If a foreign vendor is involved, there is the need to ensure that
he has been there long enough to re-sell to a non-Swiss. There could also be
a long wait in some cantons to go through the procedure.
As recession touches Switzerland, you hear of local builders 'leaning on'
authorities to make it easier for new, rather than existing, properties to
be sold. As always, situations vary between cantons. Again, if a Swiss can
buy a property right away and a foreigner, while willing to purchase, must
wait, a two-tier market with different prices can develop.
Villas Abroad has its own bargain suggestions. The Grand Hotel at
Sainte-Croix, overlooking Lake Neuchatel, is an old-style, stately hotel on
the French Riviera scale with pool, tennis and other facilities. Nearly all
its apartments have been sold and prices have now been slashed to clear the
rest.
You might not choose the furniture that goes with them - large and heavy,
although certainly serviceable - but the prices are down to Pounds 92,000.
Then there is Leysin, a resort on a plateau high above Aigle which is
renowned for long hours of sun. Many buildings, originally clinics, have
been converted to apartments, with some now available for around Pounds
88,000.
David de Lara &amp; Partners is another agency which has property in a number of
cantons. It produces a booklet giving brief descriptions of these areas and
price ranges. Chalet-style apartments in Chateau-d'Oex (in the canton of
Vaud) are from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 450,000; in Wengen (Bern), from
Pounds 123,000 to Pounds 257,000. At Riva san Vitale, Lugano (Ticino), there
is a one-bedroom apartment with three balconies, on the bank of the lake, at
Pounds 145,000. In the village of Klosters (Grisons), few properties can be
sold to foreign buyers, but the agency does have studios and one-bedroom
apartments from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 206,000.
With the growing number of golf courses and variety of recreational
activities, many mountain resorts are changing in character. Indeed, the
scenery from some has to be viewed through confetti-like showers of
para-gliders. 'A lot of people don't want to be inundated with tourists.
They want somewhere tucked away and quiet,' says de Lara. For them, he
suggests Arbaz (Valais), with its lakes and forests below Anzere. Here, Les
Jolis Chalets, four three-bedroom chalets on individual plots, are being
built. Prices are from Pounds 190,000 to Pounds 260,000.
Meanwhile, for the non-Swiss who would like his own chalet in Villars -
where only apartments are allowed to foreigners in the centre - there is Le
Petit Duc, a half-chalet. The lower section, with three bedrooms, other
rooms, basement and garden is for sale at Pounds 570,000.
Osbornes: 071-485 8811; Hilary Scott Overseas: 0243-554 319; Villas Abroad
(Properties): 081-891 5444; David de Lara &amp; Partners: 081-742 0708.

SILVANO CELLERINI is unashamed in his admiration of Hermes of Paris. As a
young and penniless repairer of handbags in a one-room business inherited
when his uncle died in the 1940s, he would marvel at the perfection of the
craftsmanship, design and materials of the Hermes bags brought in for repair
by frugal aristocratic Florentines.
In his words: 'I had no money to buy the leather and make the bags.' One day
a customer brought him her Hermes bag and asked him to copy it. Cellerini's
fate was sealed. 'People said: 'it is not possible for you, Silvano
Cellerini, so young and so poor, to copy Hermes'. It was a challenge. The
Signora gave me the bag and said 'copy this please', so I copied.'
In 1956 he moved to a one-room workshop in 16th century premises in the via
del Sole in Florence and sold his entirely hand-made bags and belts direct
to customers from the workshop. This was at a time when many people were
producing Hermes 'knock-offs', but only Cellerini made them with the same
skill and minute attention to detail upon which Hermes prides itself.
Cellerini hand-cuts the leather from life-sized cardboard patterns for each
part, from tiny straps to handles and buckles and fastenings. Some 200 to
600 different patterns hang from the wonderful period ceiling in his
upstairs workshop. His designs are the epitome of restrained Florentine
elegance, with imaginative use of coloured leathers and juxtaposition of
materials.
Waterproofed canvas and feather-weight Japanese pigskin are married with box
leather. Belts that conceal money and credit card holders, and handbags with
secret panels to foil muggers and pickpockets, are masterpieces of design.
Cellerini's prices are less than half those of Hermes and are cheap when
compared with those of factory-made designer leather goods. Meanwhile his
profits are inevitably healthy - with no global market hype to bankroll.
Publicity is strictly by word of mouth. The elegant shop at 37R via del Sole
 -below his original workshop - is a testimony to his success.
The business embraces himself, his daughter Alessandra and her fiance
Alessandro, plus three craftsmen - two of whom have been with the family
firm for 34 years and 25 years respectively. When her mother died four years
Alessandra stepped into her shoes as works manager and now she supervises
'the factory' and the hand stitching of leather pieces. Cellerini claims his
is the last remaining 'factory' in this historic part of Florence.
In the stockroom adjoining the workshop above the shop, rolls of luscious
leathers - pastel suedes from France and box calf from Italy, France and
Germany, all dyed in jewel colours - are lined up on shelves. 'The best
tanneries are in France and Germany,' explains Alessandra.
Twenty years ago, Cellerini used to send out a catalogue of drawings of his
designs to clients. No more. 'The customers who know our quality do not need
a catalogue: they fax us and we fax back a drawing with dimensions, and
quote a price. They order, we make the bag.'
The fax number is 055-283 109. The telephone number is 055-283 533. The
leatherwear is only available from the VIa del Sole and will stay that way:
Alessandra and Alessandro are intent on keeping the business intact. 'We
want only to speak direct to our customers. We enjoy the business: it brings
us joy,' explains Alessandra.

A FLORENTINE, Milanese or Roman can spot jewellery by Buccellati from across
a crowded room. Its hallmark is hand engraving of silver, white and yellow
gold of such intricacy that the metals sparkle like precious stones. Any
gems that happen to be encrusted within this setting are almost incidental.
Lorenzo Buccellati is the 'favourite son' of the late Mario Buccellati, who
was dubbed 'The Prince of Goldsmiths' by the author Gabriele d'Annunzio back
in 1922. The house of Mario Buccellati was founded in 1919 in the shadow of
la Scala in Milan's Largo Santa Margherita. Now it occupies a site in the
mecca of fashion in Milan's via Montenapoleone. A second shop is sited in
the smartest street in Florence - the via Tournabuoni, which literally means
'the street of good returns.'
Lorenzo is the artist and Claudia, his wife, is the marketing force behind
Buccellati. Lorenzo does not design for global glitterati who might anyway
prefer a more ostentatious style a la Bulgari - the Italian jeweller that is
Buccellati's biggest rival. 'High' jewellers such as Cartier of France have
somewhat tarnished their exclusive image with the highly accessible (and
profitable) 'Les Must' collection. Even Van Cleef &amp; Arpels of Paris's Place
Vendome has a boutique collection.
But Mario Buccellati has deliberately stuck to the hand-engraving tradition
and has avoided tarnishing his image with a more popular and accessible
collection in the way that Cartier (with Les Must) and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels
(with a boutique collection) have done.
As well as its own shops the pieces can be found in another 72 user-friendly
family jewellers in provincial Italian towns, where a full-blown Buccellati
shop would not work. These family jewellers carry a pared-down 'Diffusion'
collection of Buccellati's simpler, traditional gold earrings, rings and
cufflinks. There is no compromise over quality: it is merely a collection in
the lower price bracket of Buccellati's range.
Buccellati's shops, with their museum-like air, can be daunting: security
has to be very tight after a series of robberies in 1989. Display cabinets
show jewels of great beauty, but also charming silver objects such as small
birds, leaves and flowers for table displays.
In Italy, as in the rest of the world, it is not the right time for great
displays of wealth. Lorenzo Buccellati's 'high' jewellery designs are valued
for their craftsmanship and appeal to more subtle tastes. But he goes on
quietly making special pieces for his own customers - most notably
Florentines - which show that though tastes may have changed, money is not
exactly scarce. For example, he made a three piece 'suite' of necklace,
earrings and ring for a Florentine businessman a couple of years ago. To
make the same thing today would cost Dollars 7m, (Pounds 4.6m) calculates
Claudia Lorenzo, gold calculator in hand.
But to Lorenzo it is not value and cost that interests him, but design. The
necklace is best described as a collar of lace woven in diamonds and set in
highly engraved yellow and white gold. There are 67.96 carats of diamond,
including 20.21 carats in nine teardrop yellow diamonds, which were
Lorenzo's inspiration.
The client left it to Buccellati, with no price limit. All he said was:
'Lorenzo, it must be diamonds. Do your best.'
Only the Buccellati shops in Milan and Florence - owned by Lorenzo and
Claudia - may bear the name Mario Buccellati. Lorenzo's brothers, who set up
independently after a family feud over money, control other Buccellati
outlets in Rome, Porto Cervo, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo.
Mario Buccellati's hand-crafted production means that volume is small so
there is invariably a waiting list. Clients include royalty, the arts and
showbusiness, the Queen, Prince Charles, Peter Ustinov, Liza Minelli,
Barbara Sinatra and the late Arturo Toscanni and Maria Callas.

ACROSS THE Arno, at via Bartolini 4, the Marchese Alessandro Pucci, elder
brother of Laudomia Pucci (see story, left) by 1 1/2 years, is preserving
one of Florence's oldest crafts in almost surreal medieval mode.
He runs Antico Setifico Fiorentino, which employs 13 people, including Pucci
himself, to produce fine silk and linen cloths for interior decoration on
antique machines - the oldest of which were designed by Leonardo da Vinci.
Even the most modern are dated from 1860 to 1907.
It is not a question of nostalgia, insists Pucci, who is a former investment
banker. 'These machines can handle very fine raw materials and turn out the
finest of cloths in a time honoured way.'
The silk threads used for some fabrics are as fine as baby's hair and come
from Brazil or China, where the quality is better and the cost less than in
Italy. Dusty pinks, smoky blues and shades of jade in shot taffetas are used
in couture gowns and recall the iridescent pastels of Renaissance
masterpieces.
The most expensive fabric is Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 671) a metre - a delicate
floral print. Silk and linen mixed upholstery weight cloths are around
Dollars 50 a metre.
Emilio Pucci saved the building works in the 1950s - a hotel was to go up on
the spot - by putting together a syndicate of old Florentine families to buy
it. Pucci now has the majority shareholding and the workers themselves all
have a small stake.
Turnover, at some Dollars 1m a year, is 'less than that of a good ice cream
stand,' shrugs Pucci. But he has twice doubled sales in the last six years,
and is now making a small profit. If he can double up again, his profit will
leave ice cream vendors standing.
Antico Setifico Fiorentino's sublime little garden is heavily scented with
roses, lavender and hung with vines. There is even a banana tree. For those
who cannot call in, the fax number is 055-218 174. Pucci is happy to deal
with clients directly at factory prices rather than exclusively through
decorators.
A bachelor, he has inherited his late father's legendary charm: 'For a
minimum order of 30 metres, I will dye any fabric any shade - even match it
to the colour of your eyes,' he says.

DESIGNER Emilio Pucci, aristocrat, politician, soldier, artist and
sportsman, died in Florence in November aged 78. But his spirit of adventure
lives in his 31-year-old daughter Laudomia, who is head designer and chief
executive of the fashion house built by her father and based at the family's
15th century palazzo in Florence at No 4, via Pucci.
The courtyard, entrance and sweeping staircase are imposing - even
intimidating. A new boutique in the trendy via della Vigna Novella, and a
smaller outlet on the corner of the site occupied by the Palazzo Pucci at
the via Ricasoli, will in future sell Pucci products and show how to wear
them in the 1990s. These two retail outlets and a third boutique on 64th
Street between 5th and Madison in New York are the only places in which the
pared-down Pucci Collection can be bought.
Pucci 1990s style is essentially throw-away chic: the traditional silk
printed shirts (about L600,000, or Pounds 250) look great when worn over a
black polo necked sweater and with black Levis. The scarves, belts and
costume jewellery work well with the simplicity of Armani suits or Pucci's
matching leggings and knitwear.
Nobody models the look better than Laudomia Pucci herself - a strong
physical presence, even in the Palazzo's Olympic-sized marble floored hall
hung with ancestral portraits and lavish blue and white printed velvet
drapes.
Laudomia is pictured wearing a black velvet trouser suit from her 1992-93
autumn collection. The trousers are slightly flared, the long lean jacket is
lined with silk in green, turquoise and blue hues that reflect the print of
her gilet, which she wears over a black polo necked sweater.
With tousled dark hair and no make-up, Laudomia embodies the Pucci customer
in the 1990s: younger, more sophisticated and much more idiosyncratic than
her 1960s counterparts. Her 1993-94 autumn collection pays homage to her
father's legacy in exuberant geometric designs in silk. But the shapes are
classic, clean and strong, with black acting as a foil for colour.
The Pucci look now is less overtly sexy than the high-voltage colours and
skin-tight shapes pioneered by her father in the 1950s and 1960s. But it
still takes panache to wear it well.
The summer collection is ablaze with colour and embraces an array of amusing
accessories, such as a Pucci-printed baseball cap in cotton at L50,000,
sunglasses at L120,000, swimsuits L150,000 to L200,000 and black cotton
handbags edged in Pucci-printed braid at L250,000. Silk twill trousers and
tunics with Lycra have a beautiful shine and feel. Knitwear includes fine
wool trousers with silk printed front panels on both sweater and cardigan -
at about L1m (Pounds 417) they are not cheap, but they will go on looking
timelessly classic and classily chic for years to come.
Laudomia worked on the production of ready-to-wear at Givenchy for a year
and a half in the mid-1980s. She has a doctorate in economics and politics
from Rome University and wrote a thesis on communist parties. 'My father was
ahead of his time in design,' she says. 'But no sooner did he have an idea
than he was on to the next. Execution of ideas bored him stiff. He was an
artist. He liked to create.'
The sassy jet-setting Pucci look which graced the likes of the then Jackie
Kennedy in the 1960s faded into obscurity in the mid-1970s as women followed
the lead of Yves St Laurent and later Armani, into trouser suits, padded
shoulders and the androgynous look that symbolised emancipation. Emilio was
bewildered - and sickened. He hated to see the female form undermined. 'For
him, it was not paying service to women, who he adored until his dying
breath,' says his daughter.
Emilio was also baffled by the Pucci comeback in 1989 - when Laudomia
entered the business full-time. He had pioneered the body conscious bodysuit
in 1985 - a mode his then 23-year-old daughter said women would not dare
wear. But they did dare.
Laudomia has cleared out the multitude of licenses which her gadfly father
signed up and which devalued the brand. She has struck an exclusive deal
with Italseta over men's ties - the prints are not for wimps but are loved
by Americans, Germans and Italians who have got what it takes to wear them,
even at L80,000 each.
Pucci's turnover is about L20bn a year, and profits are considerably less
than they were in the heady days of the late 1980s. The potential for
greater sales and profit is limited, and Laudomia knows that. 'This will
never be a mass produced global business. This is a very special collection
 -a hybrid of ready-to-wear and haute couture - which draws on the
craftsmanship still available here in Florence.
'Our fabrics are hand-printed and woven specially for us. Our beading is
done by a tiny band of specialists also here in Florence, and I do not know
of anybody else who can supply jersey of the quality we use. Florence is
still a haven of creation and craftsmanship. Were I to join the global
fashion rat race it would mean moving to Milan, or New York or even Tokyo
and throwing billions of lire into marketing. What I do I do with passion
and great care, and I want it to remain very special.'
Meanwhile, haute couture at Pucci is a snip - as there is no collection as
such there are no costs to cover first. Clients say what they want, a sketch
is made and a price is settled. Costs work out at some Dollars 4,000 for a
short evening dress and Dollars 2,000 a jacket. Addicts include Madonna,
Paloma Picasso and the Queen of Jordan.

THE best thing about having a husband who arrives home with an armful of
expensive carrier bags whose swathes of tissue paper whisper glamour is -
the husband. But this page is concerned with fashion, rather than romance or
virtue, so I will confine my observations to the clothes.
The second best thing about having clothes chosen by your spouse is that you
are obliged to try colours and designs that are normally outlawed by your
own prejudices, often for no sound reason.
Thus my first Betty Jackson ensemble, in a shade of green I would never even
have fingered, was one of my most admired during its first outing nearly a
decade ago, and has just (sorry, Betty) been reconditioned for re-use in the
economical 1990s. And my most useful garment last summer was the red Hong
Kong dress which had bare shoulders and long, tight sleeves, a combination,
I would have thought - quite wrongly as it turned out - which would have
made it unsuitable both when it was too hot or too cold. In fact the
stretchiness of the fabric means you can pull the whole thing up around the
neckline if necessary.
I have always been thrilled by these surprises, but sometimes appalled by
the extravagance. The brace in dramatic red velvet has been particularly
difficult to amortise sufficiently to appease the conscience of one brought
up to believe in the virtues of parsimony. I wonder where that vendeuse is
now?
The price tag that made me most uncomfortable was that spent on Jean Muir
(and this was from her cheaper, Studio range.) The fishy jacket is wonderful
and will doubtless be worn for many years, but the simple black top and
skirt were ludicrously overpriced and a duplicate of what most women have
already. Perhaps I should have saved a few hundred pounds by quietly taking
them back. But exchange seems a brutal response to a gift.
All I would say to men who buy clothes for women is this: size matters.
Snoop for clues on labels of tops and bottoms already in her wardrobe. Most
British women are somewhere in the 10 to 16 range. It is as humiliating to
be bought something too big (implying that he sees you as an elephant) as it
is to model something for him with a gaping zip. Try to choose things where
fit is not so crucial. Rigid waistbands and figure-hugging tailoring are
much riskier than looser jackets. Knitwear, scarves, shawls and wraps,
anything stretchy and accessories (other than shoes) all make better bets.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Fashion: Your skirt is lovely, Sir - His habit started 11
years ago, when he popped into a smart London shop and bought a long checked
skirt for Pounds 80. In the first of a short series on people who buy
clothes for their partners, Nick Lander explains the pleasure he gets buying
clothes for his wife, Jancis Robinson - usually on impulse and always
without her

I MUST confess to an addictive habit, one that I have suffered from for the
past 11 years. It has proved expensive but not extravagant and has given me
a great deal of pleasure without harming anything other than my wallet.
It began modestly just after 10am one December morning at Brown's in South
Molton Street, London. Looking furtively both ways to make sure I would not
be spotted, I walked in and bought a long, checked Perry Ellis skirt for
Pounds 80.
My habit continued in a basement in Soho, took a strong hold in a designer's
shop off Carnaby Street and reached its most costly form nine years later at
Jaeger in Regent Street. But I have indulged in it around the world - on the
last occasion, three months ago, in a very plush shopping plaza in Hong
Kong.
I really enjoy buying clothes for my wife, usually on impulse and always
without her. It is not just the giving which supplies the pleasure. Nor
watching her put on what I have bought and wondering whether she will like
it (so far the success rate is 100 per cent).
What I like is that buying the clothes and watching my wife wear them
dramatically increases the sexual message that all good fashion designers
try to instil in their clothes.
I have no fashion knowledge or training but I know what I like - strong,
individual designs or patterns, good fabrics well-cut, clothes that hang
well. I like, too, those things which appeal immediately, even on the rack,
but give the impression that they will last.
I know that these are not uncommon likes, but for me there are two extra
sources of pleasure: first, imagining Jancis in them when I am in the shop
and she is not, which is obviously the fantasy element; second, seeing her
wear them when I revert to the role of proud husband.
The designer Betty Jackson nurtured my habit. When I tentatively mentioned
to her that I was looking for something for my wife, she told me to come and
look around her workshop. I was smitten, and a number of outfits followed:
an olive green wool skirt with two possible tops and a grey, patterned
jacket and jodhpurs. This is now the only shopping I find exciting.
A couple of years later, flipping through Vogue, my eye was caught by a
short, risque red velvet dress, designed by Helen Storey or Karen Boyd (I
forget which, for reasons which will become clear). I strolled confidently
to the designers' shared shop to be shown by the assistant not only the
dress I had spotted but its sister, a short crimson skirt and matching
jacket with a plunging neckline. Both were Pounds 140.
It was late on a cold December evening but the shop assistant showed great
concern. I was indecisive. Even when she put them on the mannequin I found
it difficult to choose. Then she showed her initiative, closed the shop door
and modelled them for me. An hour-and-a-half later, still undecided, I
bought both.
Since then, no designer label has given me the slightest apprehension. I
have flirted with Ally Cappellino and bought a very expensive Jean Muir
outfit when our marriage passed a significant landmark. This cost over
Pounds 500, but I knew it was right from the moment I saw it - a plain silk
top, knee length linen skirt and a wonderful white linen jacket with a
large, black fish motif all over. Just the thing to be seen in a restaurant
with.
I do not often baulk at the price, though I did once. Five years ago a
Chanel suit seemed appropriate but the price, more than Pounds 800, was
totally out of the question. Fortunately, my knowledgeable mother-in-law
knew the mill in the north of England which wove the fabric and, more
important, the mill shop. A tailor in Soho did the rest for a quarter of the
price.
It is not really the price which intimidates because I always have a maximum
in mind. It is how I am treated once I have had the temerity to cross what
was considered a no-go area for males that determines whether I will stay
and part with my hard-earned credit card. I immediately left a shop in
Knightsbridge when I was shown a lovely dress priced at twice my maximum.
What has added considerably to the pleasure has been the reaction of almost
all the shop assistants I have encountered. At first they show surprise
mixed with amusement, but this turns quickly to friendly concern. The young
woman at Jaeger seemed as excited as I was with the Jean Muir, and genuinely
touched by my gesture. As she wrapped the parcel she told me she had just
become engaged and hoped her future husband would come home with similar
packages.
I am sure I ask the assistants questions that make their working life more
interesting. What could be the biggest obstacle - size - has never been a
problem. I try and find someone in the shop who is roughly the same size as
Jancis, but everyone I have bought from has said that I can change clothes
if necessary. And although I am quite firm with the price of the main
outfit, I am a pushover when it comes to accessories.
Fashion designers and retailers of women's clothes may do well to cultivate
the male buyer. On a recent food writers' trip to Hong Kong, our party
walked past a shop with a striking Donna Karan dress in the window. It was a
long-sleeved, body-hugging red Lycra dress with a broad red bow at the neck.
I stopped to admire it, as did the only female member of our party who
selflessly volunteered to model it for me. I bought the dress, which cost
Pounds 75, and on the way to the airport she confessed that she had gone
back the next day and bought a similar one for herself.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Tawny times in summer's dog days - Giles
MacDonogh plumps for a lighter style of port for hot-weather drinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORT HAS been in the news again since a few of the famous houses have come
out to declare the 1991 vintage - the first declaration since 1985. One or
two companies have held back - notably Taylor and Fonseca  - and it now
seems likely that they will declare a 1992.
So, if you have a child or godchild who was born last year, hang on: you
might find something more suitable for laying down next spring.
It is possibly a personal prejudice, but vintage port strikes me as a wintry
thing: a decanter circulating round a polished walnut dining table while the
logs crackle in the grate. But in summer, tawny port is my personal
preference.
In Portugal the shippers chill them to make them more welcome in the baking
summers of the Douro Valley. In the cold snaps of a Douro spring the bottles
are, however, placed before the fire, as I remember from a visit to
Cockburn's Quinta de Tua more than a decade ago, when a torrent of icy rain
surprised us in the vineyards and the port provided a warming reviver.
Some of the best old tawnies come from the so-called Portuguese houses, a
term used to separate them from the British houses which are household names
to port drinkers in the UK. However, not all are Portuguese by any means:
there were sizeable groups of Dutchmen, Germans and Scandanavians who
settled in Oporto from the 17th century onwards and plied the trade in salt
cod and wine.
Sadly, some of these old wood ports can be hard to come by: neither Quinta
do Noval nor Niepoort is easily available at the moment, as the former has
been acquired by AXA, the French insurance company, and the lovely wines of
Niepoort have been temporarily blighted by the demise of their British
agents. On the other hand you may find Ramos Pinto, Burmester, Krohn and
Calem and all four are worth a punt when it comes to their old tawnies and
colheitas.
All the port houses make tawnies, the younger ones being generally a blend
of ruby and white port to give them the distinctive tawny hue. Moving up the
scale there are the premium tawnies such as Warre's Nimrod (Pounds 14.49,
Fulham Wine Company, London, 071-371 0196) which retains something of its
youthful aggression. Real quality, however, starts with 10- or 20-year-old
wines.
To comply with the standards set by the Port Wine Institute a tawny must
present characteristics of a 10-, 20-, 30- or 40-year-old wine. In reality
the contents of the bottle will be a blend of wines averaging out at
marginally more than the stated age but some very young port will have been
used to give the wine some 'grip' on the finish; a dollop of pepper and
fresh raspberries which prevents it from going to sleep on the tongue. This
is an important counterbalance in wines of 20 years when wood ports become
particularly mellow.
Two of the best available are from Portuguese houses: Burmester and Ramos
Pinto. The former (Pounds 27.55 from branches of Barwell and Jones) is a
highly individual, almost medlar-scented wine, while the Ramos Pinto is a
rare single-estate tawny from the Quinta de Bom Retiro (Pounds 25 from
Harrods, London, 071-730 1234) which is distinguished by its firm finish.
The best of the 'British' 20-year-olds also have this fruity sting to their
tails: Sandeman's Imperial (Pounds 19.95 from Waitrose) Cockburn's (Pounds
17.99 from branches of John Harvey of Bristol), Graham's (Pounds 24.25,
Harrods; Pounds 22.99, Selfridges, London) and Taylor's (Pounds 23.99 from
branches of Threshers or Unwins). The Taylor is possibly the fruitiest of
the lot.
As they grow older, wood ports develop creaminess and this is a mark of
30-year-olds. Dows' (Harrods Pounds 40), Graham's (Lay &amp; Wheeler,
0206-764446 and Taylor's (for stockists 071-222 2522) all make lovely
30-year-olds, but the best of the bunch is the bicentenary bottle put out by
Sandeman's last year. It is a lively wine with a taste reminiscent of nuts,
figs, violets and liquorice (Pounds 95 from Oddbins Fine Wines in the City
of London, 071-236 7721)
Portuguese houses make vintage tawnies under the name colheita (literally
'harvest'). Unlike tawnies these are unblended and their detractors point
out that old colheitas can taste a little tired without the young port they
need to beef them up. This is very much a question of taste.
For the open-minded there are some marvellous colheitas to be had. Krohn
makes a good '76 (the '78 does indeed taste tired) and a simply gorgeous
1963. Vintage buffs will recall this as one of the best years since the war.
(Pounds 11.75 for the '78 and Pounds 27.95 for the '63 from Richmond Wines,
081-948 4196).
Calem is another house which specialises in colheitas. The 1962 may lack
that spicy finish but it has a delicious mellow nuttiness (Pounds 328.37 for
six bottles from Original Wines, 071-401 8664). There are few 40-year-olds
about, but Taylor's makes a vibrant example with a rich, strawberry-like
character (Pounds 63 from Harrods).
Tawny ports have the advantage that they are ready to drink when you buy
them and will not go off too quickly. This is not the case with vintage port
unless you opt for the so-called single quinta wines which are released on
to the market when the shippers feel they are right for consumption. As
their name implies they are mostly - but not all - the product of one farm
or estate and they are always made in years when no vintage is declared.
This does not mean they are always worse than vintage. There have been
occasions - 1975 was a case in point - when the wisdom of declaring the
vintage has been called into question. For anyone who does not appreciate
the taste of wood port and who wants something for drinking now I can
recommend the following: 1982 Quinta de Cavadinha from Warre (Pounds 17.09
from branches of Thomas Peatling) with an enchanting chocolate-and-fresh-fig
character; 1978 Quinta de Vargellas from Taylor (Pounds 27.99 from branches
of Threshers or Victoria Wine) with its peppery, raspberry character typical
of the house style; and Fonseca Guimaraens 1976 (Pounds 18.95 from Lea &amp;
Sandeman 071-376 4767), which is very powerful indeed. My only quibble is
that it is so splendid it would do no harm to lay it down for a few years to
get the very best from it.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Cookery: The best of British in the open air - Philippa
Davenport flies the flag for traditional picnic fare - as long as the
weather holds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS now, most British picnickers have failed to fly the flag. When
France reigned supreme in matters gastronomic, we spread gingham cloths with
sticks of bread, ripe soft cheeses, pots of rillettes or other pates and a
few cornichons. Then came the fashion for gazpacho and potato-packed Spanish
omelettes. The Italian phase began with Parma ham wound round grissini, and
mozzarella with tomatoes and basil. More recently rocket, focaccia, sun
dried tomatoes and bresaola have been to the fore. Squeezed somewhere in
between were Greco-Turkish and Middle Eastern favourites, including
dolmades, spanakopitta, felafel and pitta breads stuffed with bulgar wheat
and parsley salad.
The Mediterranean circuit thus completed, is it not time to return home?
Nostalgia for Betjemanesque picnics with sand in the sandwiches prompted me
recently to put some childhood memories into edible practice and I rejoiced
to rediscover just how appetising our own native picnic offerings can be.
The traditional picnic sandwich made with alternate slices of good brown and
white bread, sliced nanny-thin, cut into triangles, crustless or not as you
wish, is satisfying and truly delicious when filled with such things as
potted shrimps and watercress, tomato with mint, roast chicken and York ham
with lettuce, and cucumber with Marmite. So too are jam sandwiches,
particularly when made with greengage jam sprinkled with walnuts laid on
bread spread with cream cheese or butter seasoned with orange zest.
Also well worth reviving in picnic circles are individual meat pies small
enough to fit into the palm of your hand; hard-boiled eggs served with
screws of greaseproof paper containing Maldon salt and chopped fresh herbs
in which to dip the eggs as you shell and eat them; and the partnership of
fruit-laden luncheon cake with wedges of hard English farmhouse cheeses.
After years of absence such treats seem almost novel now to the young born
into a quiche and pizza society, and these British picnic foods are
distinguished by one undeniable advantage over most other options: they are
easy to pack and unpack and relatively unmessy to eat whether you are
sprawled on the grass or beach or are forced to sit sardine-fashion packed
into the car. No mean consideration given our climate.
LITTLE LAMB PIES (makes 14-15 small pies)
Individual pies like these should comfort the shivering after a dip in the
Atlantic briny. They could be tucked neatly into the saddlebags of riders
and cyclists, and might prove welcome slipped in alongside the pocket
hip-flasks on the Glorious Twelfth.
1-1 1/4 lb neck fillet of lamb; 1 small onion; 4-6oz mushrooms; a generous
knob of butter; a little lemon juice; fresh chopped mint;  1/4 teaspoon
curry powder;  1/2 teaspoon flour; lightly chilled shortcrust pastry made
with 12oz plain white flour, 3oz each butter and lard, a good seasoning of
salt and freshly ground black pepper and about 4 tablespoons cold water to
bind; beaten egg to seal and glaze the pies.
Rub the lamb with pepper, brush it with lemon juice and let it marinate for
a few hours. Then grill it until browned without and juicily pink and tender
within - about six minutes on each side. Let the meat cool before dicing it.
(Dicing gives the pie much better texture than mincing or whizzing the meat
in a food processor.)
Chop the mushrooms quite small and saute them in a little butter until
tender and reduced in bulk. Remove them from the pan. Add a little more
butter and the finely chopped onion and cook until the onion is thoroughly
softened.
Stir in the deliberately small quantity of spices. The idea is to season the
dish interestingly, not to 'curry' it. Sprinkle on the flour, pour on 2-3 fl
oz water or stock and the juices that run from the lamb when you chop it.
Cook, stirring continuously, until the gravy thickens and clings to the
onion stickily. The mixture should be moist, not wet, lubricant enough to
bind the filling ingredients and prevent them from drying out during baking.
Draw the pan away from the heat. Stir in the mushrooms and lamb. Season with
salt, pepper and two tablespoons chopped mint and mix well.
Roll out the pastry and cut half of it into rounds large enough to line
mince pie tins or similar. Lay the pastry in the tins and spoon the (by now
cold) filling into them. Cover with lids cut from the remaining pastry. Damp
the pastry edges with beaten egg and pinch to seal securely. Glaze and make
steam slits.
Slide the pie tins on to a pre-heated baking tray and bake at 400` F (200`
C) gas mark 6 for about 30 minutes until the pastry is brown and crisp on
top and set firm underneath with no hint of sogginess.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Travel: A round in the footsteps of Columbus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMAICA was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1494. It has 120 rivers,
more botanical gardens than any other Caribbean island, and what seem to be
more churches per mile than any other country. It is 145 miles from east to
west and 51 miles at its widest. But it does not have many golf courses.
I was there to watch the world championship being played at the Tryall golf,
tennis and beach club. But it was not long before I decided I was not going
to be outdone by the likes of Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Ian Woosnam and Seve
Ballesteros. If they could play golf in the pleasant 80`F heat, then so
could I.
At the Wyndham Rose Hall resort course, near Montego Bay, the woman in the
pro shop seemed concerned only to take my money. 'Where do I change?' I
asked. 'There,' she replied, gesticulating at a bench outside.
The two nines of this 6,617-yard course are as different as chalk and
cheese. The first is flat and the holes run side by side. The seventh is a
good, short hole of 170 yards: you aim at the sea. The eighth is even
better: a par four that curves around a bay, it resembles the 18th at Pebble
Beach except that it is 200 yards shorter.
Children sit on a sea wall, smiling. As you walk past, they chant: 'I am
going in the sea.' Which is exactly what I did, after hooking my drive. A
few minutes later, the children approached and sold the ball back to me.
The later holes on the back nine reminded me of the Nuwara Eliya course in
the highlands of Sri Lanka. Vegetation crawled up and down the sides of the
surrounding mountains. Standing on the 15th tee, no humans could be seen.
The course at the Half Moon golf, tennis and beach club was laid out by
Robert Trent Jones in the early 1960s. It is just across the road from the
famous hotel and resort, and six miles east of Montego Bay.
Nearly all the the holes have slight kinks, which helps to make them long
and demanding. The point, however, is that even when the trade winds are
blowing, they are just about playable. More than 30,000 rounds each year are
played at Half Moon, half by Europeans and Japanese.
'Jamaica is moving forward,' says Heinz Simonitsch, the Austrian managing
director of Half Moon. 'The economy is on the up, even though Jamaicans are
never on time. They could never stage a revolution: if it was due to start
at 6pm, they would not arrive until 9pm.'
Simonitsch tells how tennis expanded at his hotel. 'We used to have two
tennis courts but that was not enough, so I built two more. Then three more,
and I thought that must surely be enough. It was not. I added four more -
with lights - and still the demand exceeded supply. I built two more, so now
we have 13 in all and seven are lit.
'Golf is getting a little like that. Until 1985, we had paid little
attention to it but, since then, we have spent Dollars 3m on improving the
facilities.'
I would not mind if I never played Wyndham Rose Hall again. But I would be
sad if I could not have another round at Half Moon, followed by lunch at a
restaurant overlooking the beautiful bay from which it gets its name.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Travel: Loch Lomond through the mist of time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DENSE fog I stepped ashore at Greenock, caught a train to Glasgow and a
bus to Drymen, hitched a lift to Balmaha with an army despatch-rider, and
walked up the lochside road. It was my first time in Scotland and so far I
had had hardly a glimpse of it.
Six of us sat down to supper in the white-painted inn beside the ferry slip.
Four were beautiful young girls from Glasgow. Their delicate white skins
were as new to me as their extrovert innocence. I had never encountered such
wide-eyed morale-building attention, such a genuine interest in the life of
a sailor.
The other guest was a portly, overbearing individual, also from Glasgow - a
'bailie', as he kept telling us. Throughout the meal he quizzed the English
novice on words like tattiebogle and whigmaleerie. I might have done better
if I had made head or tail of his impenetrable accent. I decided that if all
the men were like him I was not going to enjoy Scotland very much. One the
other hand, if all the women were like these . . .
After supper he disappeared into the bar. The rest of us sat round an
upright piano. One girl, an amazing redhead, sang the songs of Burns and
Allan Ramsay. I was taught the words of Mary Morison, Auld Robin Gray and
the Lass o' Ballochmyle. Across the years I still hear those sweet voices.
In bed I listened to the lap of the loch against the shore and the scrape of
a boat on the shingle. They seemed to convey a vague idea of Scotland's
rough magic.
Next morning the girls and I took sandwiches and tackled the ascent of Ben
Lomond. Mist blotted out the hills, the loch and even the path to the top. I
took a short cut, floundered up a gully through a mat of saturated heather
and felt the wind in my face. It was the summit.
After a while I heard the girls approaching, singing. The breeze dissolved
the mist. As we ate our sandwiches, curtains of fog drew back. Like a stage
set, Loch Lomond and its backdrop of mountains were revealed. Everything
became clear, including the chaos of glens and crags to the south-west.
We could not see the shipping at the Tail o' the Bank, but we could make out
the configuration of the Clyde. Had I heard of Para Handy the puffer
skipper, I was asked. I had not even heard of a puffer. A small Clyde
coasting vessel, the girls told me. Para Handy (Highland jargon for Peter
Andrew) was Neil Munro's comic fictional character. Neil Who? It seemed I
had a lot to learn about Scotland.
At least I could trade quotations from The Lady of the Lake and debate the
wanderings of Bonnie Prince Charlie through the western Highlands. Our
viewpoint covered most of the territory up to Lochaber and Morven.
Sunshine flooded the loch. No boat ruffled the surface or disturbed the
silence. Nothing moved on the lochside road. I had not at that time visited
Japan, otherwise I would have seen Loch Lomond as a Zen garden, an oasis of
serenity, carefully raked and dotted with coloured stones.
This year I returned to Loch Lomond. The bonnie banks were in the news.
Environmentalists were complaining that tourism was destroying their quiet
splendour. A leading article in the newspaper I picked up in Glasgow called
for the introduction of a tough management regime for the loch. Ben Lomond
was overrun with climbers and its situation was described as fragile.
Sure enough, many walkers pushed past me on the narrow path. I was taking
the ascent quietly, for the mountain seemed to have increased its height. As
for trying short cuts, the way I did before, who in his right mind would
risk a fall of rock, a twisted ankle, pneumonia from wet heather and maybe a
bite from an adder. We were young, that other time. The disagreeable
possibilities simply did not occur to us.
I stumbled on to the summit. Crisp packets drifted and lager cans rolled
about in the same old breeze. I leaned against a litter bin until the dizzy
spell has passed. The landscape, through my bleary eyes, had worn rather
better than I. Far-off peaks and gorges still produced a sensation of
something mystical, desirable, remote, a glamour no longer attainable. Here
the day and gone yesterday, as Para Handy would have put it.
Unlike me, the emerald isles of the loch had preserved their shapes. There
was Bucinch, where Robert the Bruce planted yew trees in the hope of
producing an archery corps d'elite like England's longbowmen. There was
Ceardoch. Was that where the ruined nunnery stood, or was it the burial
ground of the MacGregor chiefs? I had forgotten.
The islets of the loch just sit there, anchored for eternity, while fast
motorboats draw concentric circles around them. Speedboats and jet-skis
jostle for elbow-room as they carve up Loch Lomond. My newspaper reported
another fatality and six injured in a collision. The friends of Loch Lomond
have mounted a campaign to have boat traffic rationed and regulated.
A mountain biker told me that the path I walked down was due for widening,
possibly surfacing with tarmac. The lochside road has congestion problems,
too. It was bumper-to-bumper.
At the old white-painted inn a good many people had come to watch football
on TV. There was no sign of the upright piano. Customers were good-humoured
and talkative in the manner of Glaswegians. I could see no one to remind me
of the girls of long ago. I walked off my stiffness on the lochside road.
People were picking blackberries, ordinary ones, not the luscious fruits of
memory, big as golf balls. I did miss those girls. I suppose they are all
great-grandmothers now.

FT  07 AUG 93 / As They Say In Europe: Wyatt Erm rides again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIE Soros and the Hedge Fund gang rode into town a week ago to release
seven innocent governments from Sheriff Buba's clutches. The boys destroyed
the Ems county jail and told the inmates they were free. But they just stood
there. 'Dutch' Gilder even built himself a tiny cell all of his own. Ed
Balladur shouted that nothing had changed. Buba's notorious deputy, Rip van
Kinkel, said he would have the whole lot back inside on January 1.
The inmates had lost their chains but gained a brand new set of resentments.
Unwilling to stumble into the great wide world, they muttered imprecations
against those responsible for making them responsible. The French had coined
the phraseology of the 'Anglo-Saxon plot' but it was in Spain that it became
the official view as state television hammered the message home.
Generally the broadcast media had a bad monetary crisis. German television
stations, for example, took hours to grasp the significance of the failure
to cut the discount rate. And German newspapers seemed out of touch - as
usual. They showed little interest in the activities of their Bundesbank
until the crisis was on its last legs.
Last Saturday, when the ERM was plainly in a terminal state, the Frankfurter
Allgemeine led on the Christchurch by-election in which British
Conservatives fared so badly. But eventually atavism took over, and
suppurating national resentments burst out from the smooth skein of words
usually applied by liberal-minded editors.
Which gave me something I have longed for: a French review of the German
press. The news agency AFP wrote: 'The Die Welt daily newspaper sneered at
what it termed 'The grotesque international pleading to the Bundesbank'.'
There you have two national attitudes for the price of one.
It also revealed a gulf in attitudes towards what the French call the
'process of European construction' and the Germans call nothing at all. When
Edward Mortimer told of his journey along the linguistic fault-line of
western Europe in the Weekend FT last week, I spied the shadow of John Major
at his side.
As Mortimer travelled through Belgium, Alsace and Switzerland, the British
prime minister was pointing out his beloved monetary fault-line. To the left
lay those who keep their houses in sparkling order. To the right the Latin
layabouts who expect to don the policies of others and prosper as a result.
That, at least, is a Germanic view of the situation. The French wrongly
believe that it is the British who are so very different from themselves. In
fact the past week has shown that normal opinion, in its raw form, in
Germany is little different from that in Britain. Was it the Evening
Standard or the Hamburger Abendblatt which cheerily said that the EC
timetable for economic and monetary union was now 'waste paper?' It was the
latter.
As a result of the debacle it was not, in the German view, the prisoners who
were freed by the collapse of the ERM, but the jailer. The Bundesbank 'no
longer had to make constant allowances for weak partners in the currency
grid', wrote a Berlin paper.
The concept of 'strength' has played a perverse role in the whole saga.
Neither the French economy nor the franc are 'weaker' than their German
counterparts. The franc is less 'attractive', that is all. And that is
because the French economy suffers few of the weaknesses of the German, with
the result that it does not need applications of a 'drop dead' monetary
policy from a sado-masochistic cosmetic surgeon such as the Bundesbank.
What France does possess is a rich tapestry of paranoia fashioned by skilled
craftsmen over the ages. Some nations take their troubles in their stride or
remain blissfully ignorant of what is going on. But the French this week
cast the blame far and wide - Soros (of course), the British and the
Americans.
I should have expected this but was still surprised when Le Meridional
wrote: 'The time has come to identify the beneficiaries and maybe the real
actors in this disguised implosion of the EMS. And already behind a
disunited Europe which has to rethink all its community mechanisms there
naturally appears the shadow of GATT.'
The exchange rate system has not, in fact, been wrecked by the free trade
cowboys. In the real world the currencies of the ERM now fluctuate within a
4 per cent band, which is stable enough. The revolt on the markets was
against high interest rates, not exchange rates. In France, on our family
holiday next week, I shall receive only 10 centimes more for each Pounds 1
than before the Anglo-Saxons tried to wreck the French franc. Damn. The plot
failed.

FT  07 AUG 93 / The mysteries of the grouse moor: The grouse season starts
on August 12. The economics and politics of the sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST use of heather moorland is grouse shooting. An outdated assertion?
No: it is now firmly agreed on by all who twin ecology and employment as
desirable land use aims. Grouse shooting generates more income from heather,
consistent with good conservation, than any comparable upland activity. The
450,000 UK grouse shot annually have a commercial value of Pounds 35m. For
those who like shooting fast-swerving birds, the grouse is a uniquely
testing quarry worth paying for.
Against a background of decline in many British bird species, how is the red
grouse faring? Grouse are the primary economic resource over some 4m acres,
spread across about 480 moorland shoots. About 100 are in England, the rest
in Scotland. Based on game bags, numbers are high in England and low in
Scotland.
Grouse have been studied for many years and have proved as notoriously hard
to understand as they are to shoot. Although the species is better known
biologically, management practices for guaranteeing a good grouse stock have
only edged forward. There are still examples of moors where conscientious
management results in inexplicably falling grouse numbers, while across the
way, on rival shoots, birds pack in masses to hurtle over lines of marksmen.
The Game Conservancy, an independent conservation agency, started its
Scottish grouse research project in 1984. In spite of the eccentricities of
grouse moor performance, the Game Conservancy's exhaustive analysis of
different moors has allowed the expression of several generalisations.
For example, where moors are game-keepered, there are more grouse.
Grouse-keepering involves management of the heather, usually by controlled
rotational burning, elimination of predators (foxes and crows), and
provision of facilities to benefit grouse, such as 'dew-pans' (excavated
springs) and quartz grit (used for breaking down woody fibres in the
grouse's heather diet).
Climatic influences, recognised by shooting people for a long time, are
confirmed by scientific study. Dry and warm conditions which suit the growth
of heather, and are commoner on the eastern slopes of British hills, produce
more grouse. June is a key month, both for grouse chicks emerging from the
egg and requiring insects, and for heather growth. Over-grazing of the
heather plant has eliminated grouse in viable numbers from much of their
western range.
Tackling over-grazed moors is a study area in which the Game Conservancy has
taken steps. Removing sheep during winter and reducing grazing in summer
allows heather to grow back and shade out competing grasses. Where the land
is more degraded and the heather seed-bank has gone, radical measures, such
as the Conservancy's heather re-seeding machine, are called for.
This home-made utensil cuts slots in the ground, prepares them for heather
seed, drills in the seed, and presses it down for eventual germination. By
cultivating strips of heather it is hoped that the plant will naturally
spread outwards and finally re-create the old moorland cover. Early trials
promise success.
The restoration of moorland for its own sake would be a whimsical
extravagance were there not an important species to inhabit it. Fortunately,
advances in disease control may be able to resuscitate grouse moor economics
by eradicating the population crashes which play havoc with sporting
managers' finances.
Until now, good grouse stocks and big game bags were often followed by the
virtual disappearance of the bird and the abandonment of shooting. One
reason was sickness caused by strongylosis. Using medicated grit to kill off
parasitic worms, which burrow into the grouse's gut, researchers hope that
the boom-and-bust cycles of grouse populations may be broken. Results to
date are encouraging.
The research which arouses controversy, even before it starts, is the Game
Conservancy's study of raptors. Particularly on Scottish moors, raptors have
a reputation as significant killers of grouse. For golden eagles, hen
harriers and peregrine falcons, grouse are simply the largest and most
available protein in an environment which in winter is almost devoid of
life.
Modern bird books - sensitive to all the implications - have frequently
suggested that raptors' reliance on grouse is negligible, a finding
contradicted by the experience of gamekeepers. The Conservancy's raptor
study, at present focused on hen harriers, will determine what impact
predation has on grouse populations - a scientifically different matter from
observed instances of predation.
The climate of opinion today makes restricting the spread of raptors to
protect grouse moors a politically unlikely expedient. But the gradual
disappearance of heather moorland is not popular, either. In any case,
grouse moors have the advantage of being able to run un-subsidised balance
sheets. Gamekeepers are the custodians of the hills from which others have
departed, protecting them from egg, flower and fish thieves.
In order to run commercial businesses, shoot managers have to maintain
grouse at artificially high levels. Over and above breeding stocks, there
must be a surplus to shoot. This artificial level, a manipulation of bird
numbers by man, introduces ethical, ecological and philosophical questions.
Euro-greens are moving to outlaw all gamebird rearing. It is conceivable
they will succeed. Wild birds are for the time being seen as an acceptable
sporting quarry. But if pheasant, duck and partridge rearing were ever
outlawed, the next domino to fall would be wild game managed for sport.
The shooting man would then be left patrolling hedgerows and swamps waiting
on the chance gamebird taking to the wing. Or perhaps, by then, everything
will have been protected. The gamekeeper will have passed into history, a
tweedy rustic skulking in the woods, waiting only for Lady Chatterley.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Where to find the wild things: If you want to see a whale,
pine marten or osprey, Michael J Woods knows the place
</HEADLINE>

THE HIGHLAND midges were biting with fury on the evening I saw my first pine
marten. But the rain held off and I sat quietly, smothered in insect
repellent and with only my eyes peeping from my anorak hood, until a
delicate, red-haired creature, the size of a small cat, picked its way among
the mossy rocks and lichen-encrusted pine trunks to a bouldery den.
The animal soon disappeared but I was well satisfied, for the pine marten is
one of Britain's rarest native mammals.
Scotland is certainly the place to see many of the scarcest species. Even if
some are found elsewhere in Britain, they are often so uncommon that setting
eyes on them is about as likely as seeing the Loch Ness monster.
Take otters. Now absent from most of England and many parts of Wales, they
are so widespread on the Shetland Islands that, during a week's stay, I
enjoyed daily sightings and even spotted one playing in the wake of an
inter-island ferry.
The Forestry Commission has an otter-watching hide on Skye, at Kylerhea,
though the locals claim that they are no more common there than elsewhere on
the island, and any sheltered sea loch on the west coast of the mainland or
the islands should reward the patient watcher with good sightings.
When swimming, otters may be confused with seals, which also hang around
coastal waters. There are boat trips to see colonies of seals basking on the
rocks from several Scottish locations including Ullapool and Oban, and you
may also be lucky enough to see whales and dolphins.
If it is whales you want, you can take a special trip from Mull to look for
minke whales or spend some time on one of the many headlands or islands
along the coast, especially those overlooking the Minches, keeping an eye
open on a calm day for the broken water which may divulge the location of a
pod of cetaceans.
It can be a frustrating business, for you know full well that somewhere
beneath the surface groups of these great mammals are gliding past. If you
want to see dolphins, you can shorten the odds by looking out for the
resident schools off the Cromarty cliffs or from headlands in the Moray
Firth.
On land, Britain's largest mammal is the red deer. While they occur in
England and Wales, many conservationists feel they have reached plague
proportions in Scotland. Although they are stalked, shot and killed, these
deer can be surprisingly confiding, especially if you come at them with the
wind in your face and use the lie of the land to mask your approach. Two
prime times for deer-watching are June, when the calves are born, and during
the rut in October.
Red deer are so widespread they are usually visible from the A9 road between
Perth and Inverness; failing that they are common in the Cairngorms, with a
deer reserve in Glen Muick near Ballater. There is also a well-researched
herd on the Isle of Rhum where some scientists believe that the only pure
British red deer herd may soon exist (mainland reds are increasingly
breeding with introduced Japanese sika deer).
Apart from the reindeer, brought in in 1952, the Cairngorm area is a good
place to look for mountain hares, notable in the winter when their coats
becomes white, and also wild cats, though seeing a wild cat is a matter of
chance. If you are lucky you may spot one on a quiet walk in lonely
countryside or perhaps see a thick-tailed tabby dash across a country lane
in the beam of your headlights.
Birds are much more predictable than most mammals, especially in the nesting
season, and dramatic sea bird stacks and islands are found all round the
Scottish coasts, with large colonies of various species. There are
spectacular gannetries on Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, on St Kilda and
on Unst; nocturnal shearwaters have nesting burrows on Rhum and the Shetland
Islands; and noisy kittiwakes, guillemots and razorbills crowd the ledges in
many places.
Scotland is probably best known for its raptors, especially golden eagles
and ospreys. The former frequent remote mountains and cover huge
territories, so seeing one is a matter of luck. Recognising many of these
birds of prey can be difficult as they are often seen as silhouettes against
a bright sky at indeterminate height, so that judging size becomes a
problem.
A large bird with white underparts plucking trout from a loch is a different
matter, and very obviously an osprey. These have been a conservation success
story since the mid-1950s. It is still possible to see them from the special
hide at their nest at Loch Garten, while the Scottish Wildlife Trust has an
osprey site at Loch of Lowes near Dunkeld.
Apart from the sheets of purple heather which flower in August and
September, there are a number of specialities to delight the botanist. The
shell sand machair of the Outer Hebrides is a distinctive habitat which
supports a variety of orchids and other lime-loving species while, for the
mountain plant enthusiast, Ben Lawers, in particular, has Arctic-Alpine
flowers such as gentians and saxifrages.
The native pine forests of Scotland, of which only fragments remain, are a
sight still sought by many. As a centre for the mountains, the Aviemore
area, with its pine forests, reindeer and ospreys, together with the chance
of seeing eagles and red deer, is hard to beat. But if it is otters and
seals you want, with the possibility of cetaceans, too, then Shetland, Skye
or Ardnamurchan and Sunart can be good.
Perhaps, instead of suffering the midges, it would have been better to have
encouraged my pine marten to visit me in some well-located self-catering
accommodation. A fortnight might just be enough. These animals have a sweet
tooth, and small squares of bread and jam left out for them are said to work
well. Others, though, swear by chocolate blancmange: the animals cannot
carry it away, so they have to eat it on the spot.
Busta House Hotel, Shetland (tel: 080-622 506) has otters almost at the
front door. Skyes Charters, Skye (047-032 413) offers weeks of sailing
classic boats with plenty of wildlife included. Whale-watching trips from
Mull with Richard and Judy Fairbairns can be organised on 06884-223. Rhum
Castle, Isle of Rhum, is a good place for red deer, otters and re-introduced
sea eagles (0687 2037).
In Edinburgh, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is at 17 Regent
Terrace (Edinburgh EH7 5BN). The Scottish Wildlife Trust is at Cramond
House, Cramond Glebe Road, Edinburgh EH4 6NS. Where to Watch Mammals in
Britain is available from the Mammal Society, Zoology Department, University
of Bristol, Woodland Road, Bristol, Pounds 3.

FT  07 AUG 93 / A second venture into Infinity: Richard Cowper joins one of
the last great challenges in mountaineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUG SCOTT, Britain's most accomplished Himalayan mountaineer, is defying
fate to launch a second attempt on Nanga Parbat's Infinity ridge - the
longest unclimbed route on an 8,000m peak.
Last year he narrowly escaped death in a bombardment of rocks on the
Pakistan peak when four members of his team of seven were in retreat down
the mountain because of a severe storm.
Scott, the first British climber to ascend Everest, had been making a
reconnaissance of the planned descent route when Valeri Perchin, one of two
Russian climbers in his group, was knocked 100m down the steep Rupal face
after being hit in the chest by a rock.
When Scott got to him he was surprised and overjoyed to find that Perchin
was still alive. Unable to walk, the Russian was half-carried, half-pulled
by Scott and another team-mate down the mountain to Camp I at 4,900m over
difficult terrain in appalling weather.
The next day, cameramen Sean Smith, himself hit in the chest and foot in the
rockfall, half-climbed, half-hobbled down to base camp at 3,500m to raise
the alarm. At base camp, Alan Hinkes - a member of the team and one of
Britain's most experienced mountaineers - helped to create a makeshift
stretcher. Hinkes, Ang Phurba and Nga Temba, two climbing sherpas, plus two
French trekkers, two local porters and a cook then climbed back up in
freezing rain and mist to carry Perchin down across steep scree and loose
boulders to base camp.
Two days later the tenacious Russian had partially recovered. 'It is one of
the most dangerous routes I've ever been on,' said Scott afterwards of the
descent route. 'We are all recovering from the shock and horror . . . we are
so lucky to be alive.' Alan Hinkes and Sean Smith were so shattered by the
experience that they decided to go home. This did not stop Scott, a few days
later, from persuading the three remaining fit members of his party to make
a last-ditch attempt on his long-dreamed-of Mazeno (or Infinity) ridge.
At a time when most Himalayan climbers are obsessed with attempting the
steepest faces, the Mazeno ridge seems like a return to traditional
mountaineering: all the great Alpine and Himalayan mountains were first
conquered via ridges.
What makes the climb unique and highly dangerous is its unusual length and
sustained height. Approximately 13km as the crow flies (no one really
knows), the route is the world's longest unclimbed ridge. From the Mazeno
col the route follows a knife-edge ridge ascending and descending at least
seven mountains, most over 7,000m, to the Mazeno gap. Then comes the final
gruelling ascent in the so-called death zone to the summit trapezoid of
Nanga Parbat at 8,125m.
The ridge is awesome because of the distance climbers have to travel at a
height where the body functions at less than 30 per cent of normal
capability. In addition, a climber is exposed to the full fury of Himalayan
storms from all points of the compass, whereas faces often offer protection
in bad weather.
However, it was in a period of perfect weather that Scott and his three
companions climbed on to the Mazeno ridge for the first time from just below
the Mazeno col and went on to scale the first three Mazeno peaks, all
hitherto unclimbed. But their previous exertions had taken a great physical
and mental toll, and when a storm nearly blew them off the ridge they
decided to call it a day.
Mountaineers have tried to climb Nanga Parbat via several routes since
Alfred Mummery, the famous British mountaineer, died making the first
attempt on the mountain in 1895. But the difficuties of the Mazeno ridge
have kept all but one team away, and that by chance. In 1979 a group of 22
top French climbers, led by Jean Pierre Fresafond, were planning a new route
on the Rupal face of Nanga Parbat when an earthquake denied them the chance.
At the last minute they shifted their effforts to the Mazeno ridge. The
climb ended in disarray after only a minor Mazeno peak had been scaled.
Scott, however, remains hooked. Noted for his passionate commitment to a
handful of big mountains, he has returned to Pakistan to lead a second
assault on the ridge with an expedition of just three climbers. The other
two are Wojciech Kurtyka, a Pole, one of the world's most outstanding
high-altitude mountaineers, and myself.
Like Scott, Kurtyka has long dreamed of climbing the Mazeno ridge. It is not
difficult to understand the lure of the mountain: bounded to the north and
west by the river Indus, Nanga Parbat ('Naked mountain' in Sanskrit) stands
in isolation as the dazzling culmination of the western half of the
Himalaya. Looking to the summit from base camp in the Rupal valley, it rises
almost sheer for close on 5,000m, the biggest face on any mountain in the
world.
Many say it is also the most beautiful of the Himalayan giants. But it is
famous for savage storms and avalanches. This century only 102 climbers have
reached its summit but 55 have lost their lives trying. It is the world's
most dangerous peak.
This does not deter Scott or Kurtyka. Both are committed to climbing hard in
lightweight Alpine style with a few friends. If anyone can climb the Mazeno
ridge without oxygen and without a chain of old-fashioned camps strung along
the route, it is this pair.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Blueprints for a recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PEOPLE said I wouldn't make a decent living out of doing this.' So far that
has proved all too true for Walter Menteth and for many of the others who
follow the same career.
Menteth is an architect, a one-man band drawing, designing and
project-managing small building schemes from a converted artisan's workshop
in one of the more tired areas of south London.
The image of a self-employed architect might be that of a Jaguar driver with
large suburban home and kids in private school. But Menteth last year earned
from his practice just Pounds 11,500 after deducting running costs from his
fee income of Pounds 29,000.
'In many ways, I've been very lucky. Some architects have been forced to
sell their homes in order to generate cash to keep their businesses afloat.'
Britain's 32,000 registered architects complain that they are in the lowest
paid profession with a mean average salary of Pounds 24,000 a year. The
recession has proved particularly unkind to them. Of the 6,500 architectural
practices, the Royal Institute of British Architects says more than half are
one or two person businesses. This is up by 1,000 from five years ago as
practices cut staff and those receiving their P45s set up on their own.
'There is half as much work about now compared with 1989 and much greater
fee competition,' says the institute. 'Those architects classed as
unemployed or underemployed was 14 per cent in the last study in 1991 but we
would be surprised now if it is less than 20 per cent.' As the malaise in
building is so pronounced it is surprising that this figure is not higher.
Every profession has its fat cats. In architecture big names like Sir
Richard Rogers and Sir Norman Foster are not short of a few bob. But for
younger architects like 36-year-old Menteth, money does not grow on trees.
Having completed his BSc in architecture at Nottingham University, Menteth
worked in Belgium and Germany, and, after jobs in a couple of practices in
Britain, set up on his own in 1985, first in his flat, then in small
studios. He had no capital.
Menteth says architects should possess some sensitivity in their make-up.
'You have to have something like that if you are designing for people.
Architecture is a humanist, a liberal profession.'
Some might say Menteth takes this to extremes which prove to be both a
strength and a weakness in running his practice. Much of his efforts are
directed towards housing associations and local community projects which
held up better than commercial work during the first stage of Britain's
construction crash. But he missed out on some of the more lucrative
commercial business of the mid-1980s and public sector cash contraints are
now crippling community projects.
'In the development boom I felt myself out of kilter. I was not enamoured
with it and thought it was structurally wrong. There was a lot of money to
be made and opportunities for extending egos. But I didn't see anyone doing
buildings that I'd like to see done for people.'
Most of Menteth's work involves refurbishment, and he has just completed his
first new build project, a small block of flats. His biggest project is a
house under construction for a total cost of Pounds 440,000. His smallest
was an Pounds 800 contract to build a small set for an exhibition.
Architects' fees sound handsome. The national charge scale ranges from 5 per
cent to 16.5 per cent of total project costs depending on types and size of
the building. But that does not help much if there is a general shortage of
projects and when new cost pressures are squeezing small practices. Housing
associations, strapped for cash, now tend to ask Menteth to design projects
effectively free of charge, payment only made if or when the association has
money released to it for the purchase of land on which to build. 'You can
spend two years working on a project and then a further one and a half years
to get your money. It is pretty diabolical.'
Competition is so severe that some architectural practices are waiving fees
for feasibility studies. 'There was one case in which one fee tender was
Pounds 55,000 while another practice tendered for zero. Small practitioners
will never get a look in while this is going on because of their low
capitalisation.' The impact of undercapitalisation is exaggerated in
architecture. Of the 63 potential projects Menteth has been involved with,
only a small proportion have turned into bricks and concrete.
The timing of fee invoicing can also suck a potential profit into loss. Fees
billed in 1991 were Pounds 25,000, about the same as 1990, but Menteth made
a loss because many of these were paid the following year.
Company 'outgoings' last year of Pounds 17,500 included Pounds 3,900 for
sub-contracting, Pounds 1,000 on insurance, Pounds 2,300 for rent and rates
and Pounds 1,000 for stationery.
Menteth is the first to concede that administration is not his strong point.
He also says he is too honest to take a slice of those deals offered by
clients who want the cost of projects artificially inflated so they can
apply for fraudulently-boosted local authority and government building
grants.
'On the other hand there are other people who think they don't have to pay
architects at all.' Menteth is employing a debt recovery agent to obtain
Pounds 7,500 he says he is owed by a charity run by solicitors.
To keep his head above water, Menteth rents out a property in London and he
is sub-contracting himself for the first time to another architectural
practice for two months.
Menteth struggles sometimes to see the benefits of working the way he does.
'It is difficult to take holidays. There is a lot of weekend and late night
working to meet deadlines. I often find it lonely working on my own.' Things
might get worse as the government is seeking to deregulate architects and a
general trend to take overall contract and design responsibilities away from
architects and give it to other types of project managers appears to be
taking root.
Nevertheless, Menteth hopes he can stay independent, dreading the idea of
working for a large practice where, he says, he might have to specialise in
lavatory installation or revising other people's drawings. 'It is never easy
to put up a good building and it never will be. I get a buzz out of seeing a
building I've created or altered.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: PAYE poser looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN

<DATELINE>
   YOU MAY need to take tax advice before you next go to a restaurant
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or else risk the wrath of your waiter by not leaving him a tip. This
complicated state of affairs has arisen because of a recent decision of the
House of Lords which appears to have considerably widened the scope of the
Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system.
PAYE is the linchpin of the Inland Revenue's tax collection system. It
obliges every employer to act as the taxman's agent in deducting the
appropriate amount of tax from all salary payments. The tax then has to be
handed over to the Revenue once a month. PAYE applies only to cash payments
and not to perks such as company cars. However, the value of perks may be
taken into account by the Revenue when it determines PAYE deduction codes.
The House of Lords case arose out of an attempt by the Inland Revenue to
extract tax from one Charles Herd. In 1980 Herd was appointed an executive
director of an engineering company and as part of his signing-on-package was
given the chance to buy 10,000 shares in his employer company for the sum of
Pounds 1. In 1983 his employer's parent company bought the shares back for
Pounds 380,000.
There was no dispute that Herd's profit of Pounds 379,999 was subject to
income tax under the rules applying to share incentive schemes. However,
Herd argued that since this was an income tax liability, it should have been
paid under PAYE. If that was right, then the taxman would have to chase the
parent company for its money and Herd would get away scot-free.
Although the Revenue generally tries to spread the PAYE net as widely as
possible, in this case it naturally took the opposite tack. It argued that
PAYE could not apply to a payment made by somebody other than the employer -
in this case the parent company. However, the law lords did not accept this.
Though their decision was in the taxman's favour, it was on the basis that
PAYE could not apply to a payment which was only partially taxable. Herd had
received Pounds 380,000 but only Pounds 379,999 was taxable because the
final Pounds 1 was the repayment of the price he had originally paid.
That this is an arbitrary distinction is illustrated by the facts. It seems
that if Herd had received the shares for nothing instead of paying a nominal
pound, he would have won his case.
The ramifications of this decision are likely to be particularly arbitrary
in the fairly common situation where a company making a takeover buys out
share options held by executives of the target company. Until now, the
Revenue has taken the view that these payments are not subject to PAYE
because the bidder lacks the information it would need in order to make the
correct deductions. Now it seems it will depend on whether the optionholders
have paid anything for their options. Many options are granted for nil
consideration; many others for a nominal Pounds 1. Which option is chosen
usually depends on the whim of the adviser who drew up the option scheme.
And until now, nobody thought it made any difference.
Apart from the nuisance for the company which has to make the deduction, the
application of PAYE will also mean a cashflow disadvantage for the
recipient. If he receives the payment gross, he will have the use of all the
money until the Revenue gets round to issuing an assessment against him -
which could be up to 12 months later.
How wide are the ramifications of the Herd decision? Will the Revenue now
expect PAYE to be deducted from all fully taxable payments made to an
employee, irrespective of the identity of the person making the payment? The
example of a tip given to a waiter highlights the absurdities of such an
approach.
The practical difficulties would be immense, if not insuperable. Apart from
not knowing how much tax to deduct, the payer may not even know whether the
recipient is employed or self-employed. The Revenue is studying the Herd
judgment and will decide whether to issue a guidance note.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Flagship fund steers steady course -
Unit Trusts / James Capel Income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Income fund is the flagship of James Capel's unit trust range. Indeed,
it has been one of the top 20 performing unit trusts over the past 10 years.
The trust was started in 1975 as a vehicle for private clients whose
portfolios were not large enough to be invested directly in equities. It was
a fairly small fund until 1988 when James Capel decided to make big efforts
to promote its unit trust expertise; since then the Income fund has grown
from Pounds 13m to Pounds 230m.
The aim of the trust is to have a portfolio which performs roughly in line
with the FT All-Share Index but with a higher yield. As the graph shows, the
trust has been pretty successful in keeping up with the All-Share.
Manager John Knight, who took over full responsibility for the Income fund
in 1990, says he follows a yield discipline - if a share rises so that its
yield is close to that on the market, it will normally be sold.
Maintaining payout levels has been difficult for many income funds during
the recession. Capel's interim distribution was cut by 5.4 per cent in 1992
and the final payout also suffered a 0.3 per cent reduction. Knight said the
fund has yet to declare an interim distribution for this year, but it will
not be higher than last year's. The yield on the fund is currently 3.8 per
cent.
Knight says four factors have been taking a bite out of the fund's income.
The first is dividend cuts by UK companies. A second problem is that the
management charge goes up in line with assets, but is taken from the income
account. In the stock market's recent rally, share prices have risen while
dividends have not. Accordingly the management charge is taking a bigger
chunk of the fund's income.
Third, lower interest rates have reduced the return on the fund's cash
holdings. Finally, there are now fewer partly paid privatisation stocks in
the market. These provided a high dividend yield but as they have become
fully paid, the yield has inevitably dropped.
At the moment, Knight says 58 per cent of the portfolio is in FT-SE 100
stocks, 28 per cent is in the second 100 largest stocks (sometimes known as
Tootsie), 13 per cent in other (ie smaller) stocks and 1 per cent in cash.
In terms of sectors, Knight says that the fund is overweight in the
financials with a holding of 25 per cent, as opposed to market weighting of
16 per cent. 'We like the financials, because we are reasonably positive
about the economic cycle,' he says. 'They will benefit from lower interest
rates and the falling away of the bad debt problem. Overall, the financial
sector has an above average yield and, we believe, better dividend growth
potential.'
In contrast, the fund is underweight in consumer goods - with a 24 per cent
holding as opposed to the market weighting of 33 per cent. 'We tend normally
to be underweight in the consumer sector because it is hard to find stocks
on a decent yield,' says Knight.
The ten largest stocks in the portfolio are: Shell, BAT, BT, British Gas,
Hanson, Provident Financial, MAI, Midlands Electricity, Severn Trent Water
and Ocean Group.
Over the 10 years to August 1, an investment in James Capel's fund would
have grown 500 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested, according to
Micropal). That record makes it the third best performing fund (out of 52)
in the equity income sector.
The fund's record also looks good over five years (where it is 5th out of
96) and over three years (26th out of 107). Only over the past year has
performance slipped, leaving the fund placed 78th out of 110, with growth of
26.3 per cent.
'Over the past year,' says Knight, 'other funds in the equity income fund
have focused on the recovery in the capital goods sector. I'm not running a
recovery fund so I should not be buying shares like British Steel which
don't pay the right level of dividend.' Knight says he also has a more
limited exposure to smaller companies funds (which have performed well in
the first half) than some other equity income trusts.
He says he is currently pretty bullish about UK equities, although he
acknowledges that the forthcoming results season may be 'somewhat
difficult'. Non-trading items, such as pension holidays, which have
bolstered profits through the recession, may reduce, thereby obscuring the
genuine growth in trading profits. But he believes earnings growth next year
may be 20 per cent and that is not factored into share prices.
Charges. The annual charge is 1.25 per cent and the initial charge is 5.25
per cent. The current bid-offer spread is about 6.3 per cent. The minimum
investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 40 per month via the savings scheme.
The fund is Pepable at no extra charge, although the minimum monthly
investment is higher, at Pounds 100.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: French homes, who gets what
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MOST English couples are used to the English way of owning property. If you
buy a house with your spouse, it is presumed that you will buy as joint
tenants, unless you specify to the contrary. As a joint tenant your share
will automatically be left to your spouse on your death tax-free.
You can change your mind at any time and 'sever your joint tenancy'. You
will then own the property as 'tenants in common' and, on your death, your
share will pass according to your will and intestacy. There are no
restrictions in English law on who you can leave your share to - for
example, there is nothing to make you leave your house to your children, or
stop you from leaving it to your secretary. Only if you leave your
dependants without making proper financial provision for them can your
arrangements be upset, and then only after your death and under the
direction of the English courts.
However, when an English married couple buys a property in France, the rules
are very different. It is possible to buy en indivision. This is similar to
the English 'tenants in common'. Unlike the English tenants in common you
cannot leave your share in the property to just anyone. Your children (but
not your spouse) have 'entrenched rights' to your share which automatically
accrues to them on your death, regardless of your will.
Suppose that you and your spouse own a chateau jointly and that you have two
children. If your spouse dies, you may be entitled to one third of your
spouse's share and your children to one third each, if your spouse has
written an appropriate will which respects French succession law.
At this point, English law muddies the water, since minors cannot own
property. If you want to sell the chateau after your spouse's death you will
have to make an application to court for an order authorising the sale.
In addition, French death duties will be payable, not only on the transfer
to your children but also on the transfer to you. There is no exemption from
tax on transfers between spouses. Each child and your spouse will be able to
receive value of up to Ffr300,000 and Ffr330,000 tax free respectively.
At the time of a French marriage, a so-called 'clause d'accroissement' may
be included in the marriage contract which will have a similar effect to an
English joint tenancy. In addition, assets can then pass into the sole
ownership of the survivor free of death duties. If a couple have not married
under this regime (called 'La Communaute universelle avec clause
d'accroissement), it is possible to adopt it later on.
Marriage contracts are void under English law, but an English couple
adopting the regime with regard to their French property.
One commonly suggested solution to the problem of limited testamentary
freedom in France is to buy through a Societe Civile Immobiliere, a hybrid
between a company and partnership. You will then own your chateau through
your interest in the SCI, which is called a parts de Societe.
If neither you nor your children are domiciled in France, French succession
laws will not apply to your share in the SCI, so it can be left to whomever
you please.
There are disadvantages to owning your chateau through an SCI, such as:
French death duties will be payable
If you are a director of the SCI, you could be liable to tax in the UK under
the benefit-in-kind provisions applicable to a company providing
accommodation with its directors.
There will be costs associated with setting up the SCI
An SCI cannot let furnished property, without the risk of losing fiscal
transparency
An SCI is not immune from French wealth tax.
You may be tempted to own your chateau through a tax haven company - but do
not. The French tax authorities will try to argue that the company should be
in receipt of rent from the property and tax the company accordingly if it
is resident in a tax haven; and also charge an annual 3 per cent levy on the
deemed value of your property if the company is resident in a country with
which France does not have a double tax treaty.
One idea to consider with your adviser if you and your family are UK
resident is to own your chateau through a UK company on trust, for you for
your lifetime, and thereafter, your family. However, it may be important to
give money to the UK company to buy the chateau, rather than buy the chateau
first and give it to the trust. The transfer tax on gifts is prohibitive in
France.
If you take this course: It is unlikely that French death duties will be
payable on your death if the chateau continues to be held by the UK company
on trust.
French laws will not automatically vest a share in the children You would be
using the chateau as a beneficiary of the trust, rather than as a director
of the SCI, so the UK benefit in kind tax provisions need not apply.
The UK has a tax treaty with France and is not a tax haven for the purposes
of the income charge and arguably the trust will also escape the 3 per cent
levy if it is managed in the UK.
An alternative way of dealing with these problems is to buy your chateau
personally using debt secured on the property. The problems do not vanish
but the consequences will be less severe.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Probate values
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JULY 10, you published a response explaining how subsequent sale proceeds
could substitute for probate value. My question is: Does a further probate
valuation count in the same way as a sale?
My wife inherited some stock from her mother and died just under one year
later, in which period the market had declined. Can the probate value of the
stock for my wife's estate replace the figure used for the stock in her
mother's probate value? If so, would all items of stock need to be
considered, or could a substitution be made of just those shares that
declined in value in the period?
The legislation which provides for the revision of probate values applies
only where the shares are sold. A sale would not include the devolution of
the shares under your wife's will, or intestacy. Unfortunately, therefore,
you cannot revalue the shares in your mother-in-law's estate just because
they have fallen in value and have been included in your wife's estate at
that lower value.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Share gifts to grandchild
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WOULD like to give shares to my grandchild from time to time, so creating
a fund for her use on her 18th birthday. I believe she cannot hold shares in
her own name until then. If this is the case, can I make simple arrangements
to act as her trustee until that time? (I stress the word simple because I
shall not be giving her very large sums which would justify expensive legal
procedures; I have other grandchildren to provide for later). Would it be
possible for my wife to be a joint trustee in case of my death?
You are correct in saying that your granddaughter would not be able to own
shares in her own right until she is 18. But you and your wife could hold
the shares for her in the form of a bare trust. This requires drawing up a
simple declaration of trust. The shares are in your name, but your
granddaughter is entitled to the dividends. Depending on the level of her
income, she may be able to use her personal allowance to obtain a repayment
of the tax credit attaching to dividends.
An alternative course would be to set up an accumulation and maintenance
trust, but you might not wish to go to the bother of this arrangement if the
amounts involved are very small.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Policies may escape tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY HUSBAND and I each have 15- and 20-year with-profits endowment policies
which mature in 1996. I am considering selling them on the secondary market.
One broker has advised that higher rate taxpayers would incur a tax
liability which is not levied if the policies are held to final maturity,
while standard rate taxpayers incur no tax liability. What is the position?
The broker is thinking of section 540 et seqq of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. In a library, you could look this up in one of the
multi-volume tax works such as Simon's Taxes (volume G). You will see that,
if your husband's policies and your own are 'qualifying' and have not been
made paid-up within their first 10 years, then they will escape the tax
charge in question by virtue of subsection 1(b) (ii) of section 540.
Go back to the broker and ask why he thought that section 540 would catch
the sales of the policies (in case there is some crucial point which you did
not mention in your letter). The policies should also escape capital gains
tax by virtue of section 210(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A novel tax problem from Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE gets income from Japan for a novel that has been translated into
Japanese. She has had an advance on royalties, which are received by the UK
publisher and distributed twice yearly.
Her UK publisher has advised that the advance is 'subject to a 10 per cent
Japanese withholding tax.' Can this be reclaimed from the Japanese tax
authorities? If so, how should she go about it?
No; the deduction of 10 per cent Japanese tax is authorised by article 13 of
the Japan-UK double taxation convention*.
On the other hand, your wife is entitled to credit for the Japanese tax
against her UK income tax liability, by virtue of article 24(1)(a) of the
convention. She should ask her tax office for the pamphlet on double
taxation relief, IR6.
If your wife has no UK income tax liability on the Japanese royalties (if
they are covered by loss relief, for example), she can treat them as being
reduced by the amount of Japanese tax - if that is to her ultimate advantage
 -under section 811(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
*In a local reference library, you should find a copy of the double taxation
convention with Japan in, for example, volume F of Simon's Taxes, British
International Tax Agreements, volume 6 of the British Tax Encyclopedia, or
Butterworths Tax Treaties.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: After the shock wears off . . . -
Some ways in which drivers can cut those ever-growing car insurance premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR insurance premiums have risen rapidly since the mid-1980s as claims
have grown more frequent and more expensive. The insurance companies have
been losing money so, inevitably, consumers are picking up the bill.
Premiums are not uniformly high, though. Some insurers have bigger losses to
recoup than others, and companies' ratings of different risk factors do
vary.
If you are shocked by the figure on your latest renewal notice, you need not
grit your teeth and pay up. By shopping around for quotes - as an increasing
number of motorists are doing - you could halve your premium. And if you are
one of the 400,000 people expected to get a new car this month, it could be
worth taking some time to find the best insurance deal.
The past few years have seen the rapid expansion of direct insurers -
companies which operate entirely over the telephone and, because of their
low overheads and choosy underwriters, can offer lower premiums to motorists
seen as good risks. This usually means drivers over 25 with ordinary cars
who live in the suburbs or rural areas and have no convictions or recent
crashes. If you fit this description, you might get a very good deal from
Direct Line, Churchill, GA 1-2-1, the Insurance Service, or one of the many
other direct insurers springing up around the telephone network.
They now take about 15 per cent of motor insurance business and are
expanding into other lines, such as household cover. Most are open beyond
normal office hours and at the weekend and some use free 0800 numbers, so
they have the advantage of convenience, too.
If, however, you are young, drive a hot hatch, or have a record tarnished
with motoring convictions or accidents, the direct insurers may well either
reject you or quote astronomical premiums. If you go to an insurance broker,
you could stand a better chance of finding a reasonably-priced policy.
Traditional high street brokers still account for almost half of motor
insurance business but, in line with the direct insurance trend, a number of
telephone broking services were launched recently. These use computer
systems to access many different insurers and find the most competitive
quote. Select Direct, Telesure and CGA are among them.
Another variation is OneQuote, a company which will find the best quote from
65 insurance schemes and then direct callers to a local broker who is an
agent for that particular insurer. It charges for the service by using a
premium rate phone number. Other companies - such as the AA, which deals
with a selected panel of insurers - will quote from high street branches or
over the telephone.
The main factors on which your premium will be based are the same as ever:
age, sex, occupation, address and driving record, and the make, model and
age of your car. But other factors over which you have more influence could
help cut the cost of your insurance.
The easiest way is by opting for third party rather than comprehensive
cover. This means that only damage to other people, cars or property is
covered, not damage to your own vehicle. If it is not worth much, this could
be a sensible option. But if an accident is your fault, or you are unlucky
enough have a collision with someone driving illegally without insurance (as
prices rise, an increasing number of drivers have no insurance), you will
have no one to claim from. Also, some third-party policies will not pay out
for a car damaged by thieves.
Most policies specify that you must pay a standard excess - the first Pounds
50 or Pounds 100 of any claim. If you agree to a larger excess - say, Pounds
200 or Pounds 300 - this will cut your premium. But you should be sure that,
when you make a claim, you can afford the sum to which you have agreed.
When you get a quote from a broker or insurance company, ask if it offers
any discounts - such as for keeping the car in a garage or fitting a
security device. The AA is promoting a new Tracker system which allows
stolen cars to be tracked electronically, and several insurers have agreed
to give 10 per cent discounts for vehicles with these.
Certain jobs or membership of some organisations can also carry the added
benefit of a discount with some insurers; Frizzell does special deals for
civil servants or those belonging to the National Trust. Your habits can
make a difference, too; members of the Institute of Insurance Brokers can
offer a special policy to non-smokers, as some research has indicated
smokers are more likely to be involved in accidents.
If you use the car only to go shopping, let your insurer know. Drivers
running up low annual mileages sometimes attract discounts because insurers
reason that the less time you spend on the road, the lower your chances of
crashing. And if you have an old car, you could ask about a 'classic'
policy. These usually are based on limited mileage, but can work out
substantially cheaper than standard policies.
Price is bound to be one of your main considerations when picking car
insurance but beware of small companies offering suspiciously good deals,
particularly if you are in a high-risk category such as a young driver of a
hot hatch or a convicted drink-driver.
The Department of Trade and Industry warned that a number of bogus car
insurers were operating in the UK. They attract business with low premiums
for difficult-to-insure drivers, but are not authorised to sell insurance
and their policies are worthless.
Victims may discover they have bought a dud policy only when they try to
make a claim, or are asked for their insurance documents by the police. They
could even be prosecuted for driving without valid insurance. If you are
suspicious of a motor insurance policy, ask for the name of the underwriter
 -then ring the DTI on 071-215 3165 to check if the company is legitimate.

THE RECENT Ministry of Defence decision not to award the Trident re-fit
program to Rosyth Dockyard has not dampened Lord King's enthusiasm for
shares in Babcock International, which had hoped to manage the project. His
recent purchase of 300,000 brings his total holding to more than 1m. Earlier
this year, Allan Smith and Sir Frank Gibbs (a non-executive director) also
bought more than 57,000 at around 34p.
Taunton Cider came to the market just over a year ago and has performed
steadily. Five directors, including the chief executive and finance
director, have sold a total of 1,630,800 shares at 197p. These transactions
were the board's first sales since coming to the market.
Shares in Menvier-Swain Group have performed steadily over the past two
years. Dominique Martinie, an executive director, has almost halved his
holding from over 260,000 to just over 130,000 since March this year. The
most recent sale of 110,000 was at 600p.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Why it pays to bank by mail - Postal
accounts can offer higher rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEQUES are always in the post for those who operate their savings account
through the Royal Mail. Postal accounts are attractive to savers because
they have maintained their competitive edge over branch-based accounts;
hence their regular appearance in our Highest Rates for your Money table
(see page VI).
The building societies cite centralised administration and low overheads as
the reasons for being able to pay rates on instant notice postal accounts
which often are higher than on 90-day notice accounts.
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society was the first in the market and
its London Share postal account, launched in April 1989, has spawned a whole
breed of others (as the table on this page shows). The rate on London Share
is, however, one of the lowest; C &amp; G says this is because it has added
facilities - at the request of clients - which have made it more expensive
to operate.
Customers can arrange withdrawals over the telephone, and can order
travellers cheques. They can also use the branch network to make deposits.
'London Share has become less competitive because of increased overheads and
so we cannot give rates which are as high as on a conventional postal
account,' C &amp; G explains.
The more traditional postal accounts issue customers with a passbook, or
with slips which are used to make deposits and withdrawals in pre-paid
envelopes. Most postal accounts pay yearly interest but some also have a
monthly option (as the table shows). Yorkshire is unusual in paying interest
monthly as a standard feature.
While postal accounts advertised as 'instant access' do not require notice,
it still takes customers at least a week to get their hands on any cash. If
you mail a withdrawal request on a Monday, you could not hope to get a
cheque before Wednesday at the very earliest. It would then take at least
three working days for it to clear. So, usually, you would not be able to
draw any cash until the following Monday.
Two societies, however, have got around this problem by providing their
customers with cash withdrawal cards. Chelsea's Classic account also has a
chequebook facility and its cash card, which can be used to withdraw up to
Pounds 200 daily through the Link network, also doubles as a cheque
guarantee card.
Nationwide is the only one of the big five building societies to have
entered the market and launched its Investdirect account in April. Customers
can withdraw a maximum Pounds 250 daily with their Link card.
They must, however, pay 50p each time if they use a Nationwide machine and
Pounds 1 if they use another Link member's machine. Nationwide says it
imposed the charge because the account is meant to be postal, with the card
supplied only for peace of mind.
Some postal accounts impose relatively high minima. C &amp; G's Instant 7
account, launched in May to replace the (non-postal) London Deposit account,
is a seven-day notice account which stipulates that transactions must be at
least Pounds 250, whether as a deposit or withdrawal.
The minimum withdrawal with the Yorkshire building society's First Class
return postal service, also launched in the spring, is Pounds 200. You need
Pounds 2,000 to open the account and further deposits must be at least
Pounds 100.
Along with Manchester, the Yorkshire offers a bonus, of 10 per cent of the
gross rate to investors who do not make capital withdrawals during the year.
This means that the top rate of 7.25 per cent would be translated into 7.98
per cent once the bonus is added. The bonus at Manchester is 0.75 per cent,
which increases its top rate from 7.5 to 8.25 per cent cent if no
withdrawals are made.
The table also shows that some societies - Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp;
West, C &amp; G and North of England - operate postal accounts which also
require investors to give notice of withdrawals. The rate offered by
Bradford &amp; Bingley on its Direct Notice (30-day) account is the highest (if
the bonus rates of Yorkshire and Manchester are not applied), while B &amp; W's
7.6 per cent on its 30-day Balmoral Monthly is also the highest for accounts
of this type, with the same proviso.
The only society to offer a postal bond is B &amp; W, which has operated a
series of them and is today launching a one-year, variable rate bond paying
tiered interest of 7.35 per cent gross on a Pounds 5,000 minimum, ranging up
to 8.5 per cent gross for Pounds 100,000 and over.
The trouble with variable rate bonds is the danger of the initially
attractive rate being dropped before maturity. 'Societies that do that are
just cutting off their nose to spite their face,' says B &amp; W. 'We are
committed to maintaining a competitive rate in order to keep customers.'
Perhaps the only serious drawback of postal accounts is their reliance on
the Royal Mail. The Inland Revenue recommends taxpayers not to use the
postal system to settle their tax bills because of the danger of cheques
getting stolen in the post.
The societies deny there are any significant problems - but most advise
savers sending a deposit to make the cheque payable to the building society,
followed by their own name.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: House ruling cheers buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT Court of Appeal decision should give cheer to any housebuyer who
has been gazumped - that is, ditched by a vendor in favour of someone
offering a higher price.
Last week, the Court of Appeal found in favour of Timothy Pitt, a broker who
had entered into a written 'lock-out' agreement with PHH Asset management, a
Swindon-based firm which was acting as agent for a Pounds 200,000 Suffolk
cottage.
The agreement was that PHH should accept no other offers provided Pitt
exchanged contracts within 14 days after the receipt of draft contracts. But
before the two weeks were up, the firm said it was accepting a higher offer
unless Pitt wished to match it. He declined.
Since he had spent money on arranging bridging loans and plans for an
extension, and had advertised his home for sale in the press, he sued for
damages - and won. PHH then lodged its appeal.
Rejecting it, the court ruled that the agreement was a valid contract
binding on both parties. Since this had been broken by PHH, it was liable to
pay compensation.
Tony Clark, general secretary of the National Association of Estate Agents,
said he was 'delighted' at the decision but did not think it had
far-reaching implications for the housing market.
'This case was unusual in that Pitt was wise enough to obtain an undertaking
from the vendor that it would not offer the property to another party within
the 14-day period,' he said.
'Most vendors will not want to enter into this option for the purchaser to
purchase and to exclude others.'
The Consumers Association agrees. 'We welcome the decision in principle. If
lock-out agreements became common, they would do a lot to stop gazumping but
the problem is that sellers do not want to tie themselves down,' a spokesman
said.
Only in a buyers' market, or a situation where the vendor was under pressure
to dispose of a property, might sellers go along with a 'lock-out' agreement
under which no other offer would be accepted within a prescribed period.
John Samson, property partner at law firm Nabarro Nathanson, said that while
the case did not change anything at the moment, it provided a way to create
a system under which house buying could be made an easier and more pleasant
experience.
'At the moment, neither party trusts the other. This is a method of creating
much more goodwill in conveyancing transactions and would put an end to
instant gazumping,' he said.
The firm has drawn up two different forms of standard lock-out agreement,
written in layman's English, which it hopes estate agents and the public
will use.
That is fine for buyers - but what guarantee does the vendor have that the
prospective purchaser is serious in the first place?
Samson said the purchaser would have to commission a survey and he would
have a duty to tell the vendor if he decided not to continue with the
purchase during the determined period - at which point the agreement would
become void.
The NAEA has urged the government to introduce some form of conditional
contract under which both buyer and seller would agree on a price for the
property once the buyer's offer was accepted. 'All European Community
countries, apart from England, have conditional contracts,' Clark said.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Home loan offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester building society has introduced a new range of
fixed rate mortgages in addition to its existing one-year fixed rate offer
of 5.45 per cent (APR 8.3 per cent). The new rates are 6.25 per cent (APR
8.2 per cent) fixed for two years; 6.95 per cent (APR 8.2 per cent) fixed
for three years; and 7.95 per cent (APR 8.5 per cent) fixed for five years.
Loans can be for a maximum of 90 per cent of the property's value. They are
available in repayment, endowment and pension-linked form, are available to
all borrowers, and can be transferred to another property if the borrower
stays with the A &amp; L. There is an arrangement fee of 0.5 per cent, up to a
maximum of Pounds 300. Customers must buy buildings/contents insurance, and
there are early redemption penalties.
The society is also offering one-year mortgage discounts for buyers who are
not first-timers. Loans of up to 70 per cent of the property's value get a
discount of 3 per cent off the society's variable rate, now 7.99 per cent.
There is a 2.5 per cent discount for loans up to 80 per cent, 2 per cent for
up to 90 per cent, and 1 per cent for up to 95 per cent. There is no
arrangement fee, but borrowers must buy buildings and/or contents insurance
from the society.
The Northern Rock has a rate of 7.29 per cent (8.1 per cent APR) fixed until
August 1 1997. Loans are available up to 90 per cent of valuation, with a
maximum of Pounds 150,000. There is an arrangement fee of Pounds 275, of
which Pounds 100 is non-refundable, and borrowers must take the society's
buildings and contents insurance. The mortgage is portable, but there is a
penalty of four months' interest for redemptions within the fixed rate
period.
The Lambeth building society is offering a range of mortgages fixed until
July 31 1996. The rates depend on how much is borrowed and whether the
borrower opts for accident, sickness and unemployment insurance to cover the
loan. In any case the borrower must take out buildings and/or contents
insurance with the society.
With mortgage insurance, the rate is 6.59 per cent (APR 8.8 per cent) for
loans up to 75 per cent; 6.8 per cent (APR 8.9 per cent) up to 90 per cent;
and 7.4 per cent (APR 9.5 per cent) up to 95 per cent.
Without mortgage insurance, the rates are 6.89 per cent (APR 8.6 per cent)
for loans up to 75 per cent; 7.1 per cent (APR 8.7 per cent) up to 90 per
cent; and 7.7 per cent (APR 9.3 per cent) up to 95 per cent. There is a
non-refundable arrangement fee of Pounds 250.
If the mortgage is redeemed within the fixed rate period, and the borrower
does not take out another mortgage with the society, there is a penalty of
six months' interest. For redemptions after the fixed period, and up to five
years, the penalty is three months.
The Abbey National is increasing the minimum amount for a capital repayment
on its mortgages from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,000. Borrowers wanting to repay
less than Pounds 1,000 will be encouraged to put the money in a savings
account and make a repayment when they have Pounds 1,000.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Japan finds favour in Far East funds
 -The potential for growth now a Pacific superpower is emerging from the
doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Far East investment trust sector incorporates some of the world's most
dynamic emerging markets, but it also includes the more mature market of
Japan.
That country's presence has at times seemed to act as a drag on Far Eastern
funds. Over the last seven years to August 1, Far East funds which excluded
Japan grew almost twice as much as those which included it.
However, at present fund managers in the sector are generally positive on
Japan's investment potential. Foreign &amp; Colonial's Pacific fund is about 41
per cent invested in Japan. Ian Wright, manager of the fund, says: 'It is
quite difficult to argue the fundamental case that the market is
particularly cheap in terms of investment criteria, but the scenario we have
is that the new government coming in under Hosokawa will want to stimulate
what is a very, very depressed economy. Our view is that there will be
further cuts in interest rates and also income tax cuts. We think both those
things will be good for the market.'
The Drayton Far Eastern fund is also keen on Japan, with about 41 per cent
of its investments there. 'Our strategy has been to shift more of the
portfolio into Japan. It has paid off,' says Julian Pickstone, a manager of
the fund.
Hong Kong, with the second largest stock market in the region, has an
important place in the portfolio of most funds. Managers are concerned about
the Chinese economy, and action being taken by the new economic tsar, Zhu
Rongji, to cool it down. If the slow-down were too abrupt, it could have a
harsh impact on Hong Kong and other markets with a China link.
'The current belief is that China will go through a soft landing, but I
don't think anyone knows that,' says Wright. 'There are more risks in Hong
Kong than there were six months ago. We are not putting any new money in, we
are watching and seeing rather than being terribly optimistic.'
'We are less negative on Hong Kong than a lot of our competitors,' says
Drayton's Pickstone, pointing out that Hong Kong's ties with the US are
keeping interest rates low at present. He sees potential for further growth.
Michael Watt, manager of the TR Far East Income Trust, has reduced the
fund's exposure to Hong Kong from more than 30 per cent to just over 22 per
cent. 'That has been pulled back because of some nervousness about the
overheating in China and the continuing political impasse between Britain
and Hong Kong. The feeling was that we had had a very good run in Hong Kong
for a while, and we ought to be increasing our exposure to Australasia,' he
says.
The TR trust has a very different portfolio from other funds in the sector,
as it picks stocks for their income rather than just growth potential. The
fund is expected to yield around 5 per cent this year, compared with less
than 1 per cent for the other five funds in the sector, which aim for
capital growth.
The proportion of TR's investment in Hong Kong is similar to other funds,
but it has only 1.4 per cent in Japan. Other relatively large exposures are
to Thailand, with 17.8 per cent, Australia, 25 per cent, and New Zealand,
8.3 per cent.
'You can get good high-yielding stocks, quality companies in Hong Kong,
Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, but it is very hard in most of the rest
of the region to generate high yields,' says Watt. 'The beauty of high
yields is that you find them in cheap markets, almost by definition.'
Singapore is seen as a good, fairly safe bet by several managers. The
government is expected to keep the market on an upward trend in advance of
the flotation of Singapore Telecom later this year, which could increase the
market's capitalisation by about 20 per cent. 'They are not going to let the
market fall before Telecom goes, probably in September,' predicts Pickstone.
One problem with developing markets is investment restrictions. 'The other
market we like is Korea, but that is quite difficult now because something
like 100 stocks are closed to foreign investors,' complains Wright. South
Korea imposes a 10 per cent limit on foreign ownership of a company's stock,
which has been reached in most popular ones. The limit is expected to be
raised, but until then foreigners have to wait.
These investment trusts all operate savings schemes with a minimum monthly
investment of Pounds 25. Minimum lump sum investments are Pounds 250 for the
TR and Foreign &amp; Colonial funds, and Pounds 1,000 for the Drayton fund. Pep
schemes are available with TR and Foreign &amp; Colonial, but a maximum of
Pounds 1,500 can be invested in these funds through a Pep.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Mercury looks to emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management has become the latest fund management group to
launch an emerging markets unit trust. Emerging markets is the catch-all
term used for developing countries which are waking up to the benefits of
capitalism and financial liberalisation.
About 85 per cent of the world's people live in emerging markets but they
account for only 40 of the global gross domestic product and 12 per cent of
its stock market capitalisation. Whereas the International Monetary Fund is
expecting economic growth in the developed world of 2.5 per cent a year over
the next five, the prediction for the emerging markets is 6 per cent.
The argument, therefore, is that emerging stock markets offer significantly
more attractive investment opportunities over the next few years than those
in developed nations. And while individual emerging stock markets are highly
volatile, a world-wide fund should not be like this because the markets do
not move in the same direction at the same time.
Already, there are some very successful investment trusts in the field -
such as Templeton Emerging Markets - and Prosperity Emerging Markets is the
best-performing unit trust in the international equity growth sector over
the past five years.
Mercury says it is managing Pounds 400m of institutional money in the
emerging markets already. Its new fund will start with holdings in Mexico
(22 per cent), Malaysia (10 per cent), Hong Kong (9 per cent), Korea (9 per
cent), Thailand (6 per cent), Taiwan (6 per cent), Brazil (5.5 per cent),
Portugal (5 per cent), Argentina (4 per cent), Indonesia (4 per cent) and
others (19.5 per cent).
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 while the initial charge is 5.75 per
cent (discounted by 2 per cent until September 17) and the annual is 1.5.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead - Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OF the largest composite insurers are set to be back in the black by
an impressive margin when they they report their results for the first half
of 1993 next week, underlining the recovery in the sector after recent
losses.
General Accident, the first company to report on Tuesday, is expected to
register pre-tax profits of between Pounds 90m to Pounds 120m (compared with
a Pounds 21.2m loss at the half way stage last year).
The advance at Commercial Union, which reports on Wednesday, is expected to
be only slightly less strong with a rise to between Pounds 45m and Pounds
75m, compared with a loss of Pounds 18.1m last time around.
Royal Insurance, which reports on Thursday, is also expected to record
profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 66m compared with a Pounds 79m loss
last time. Falling losses from mortgage indemnity insurance and improving
claims trends are the main reasons for the improvement, while companies are
also benefiting from currency factors.
Meanwhile, BOC's healthcare division is likely to come under the microscope
when the company announces its nine-month figures on Tuesday. Pre-tax
profits are expected to be between Pounds 262m and Pounds 275m, against
Pounds 250.5m last time, largely helped by a Pounds 23m gain on currency
movements.
Slow-growing Smith and Nephew, the bandages-to-Nivea healthcare company, has
long been eclipsed by spectacular profits from drug companies. But
Thursday's interims should reveal profits growth of as much as 20 per cent
to Pounds 77m, helped by the fall in sterling.
Standard Chartered, which also reports on Thursday, is expected to post
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 160m and Pounds 190m, against Pounds 64m
in the first half of last year. Earnings per share are expected to rise to
between 40p and 50p, against 4.2p.
When Unilever reports on its second quarter on Friday, the market will focus
on what the consumer giant says about competitive pressure. The shares have
been hit hard in recent months by worries over price wars in the US.
However, the figures themselves are likely to be reassuring, with pre-tax
profit of Pounds 545m expected for the quarter versus Pounds 511m last time.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: ERM: what should investors do now? -
Philip Coggan asks fund managers how they see the outlook forthose putting
money into Europe's equity and bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Europe's exchange rate mechanism last weekend was an event
which seemed more exciting in the build-up than in the aftermath. Currencies
are now allowed to trade within 15 per cent bands, rather than the old 2.5
per cent range, but many countries have yet to take advantage of their
new-found freedom.
Rather like the salesman of Monty Python's Norwegian parrot, Europe's
leaders seem to believe the ERM is not really dead, just stunned. Although
their countries' economies appear to cry out for the soothing balm of an
interest rate cut, currency stability still appears to be the priority. As a
consequence, all the talk of a bonanza for British holiday-makers was
premature.
Compared with Thursday of last week, a pound would have bought on Thursday
night 0.8 per cent more French francs, 0.7 per cent more Danish krone, 0.6
per cent more Italian lire, and 0.5 per cent more Belgian francs. But it was
also worth 0.7 per cent fewer German marks, 1.5 per cent fewer Portuguese
escudos, and 1.7 per cent fewer Spanish pesetas.
So, if you rushed to France with Pounds 500 spending money, you would be
Pounds 4 better off than you were a week ago: good enough, perhaps, to get
you a cup of coffee and a croissant in a Paris bar.
What about investors? When Britain left the ERM last September, the stock
market rallied sharply as they realised the government was no longer
shackled to the high interest rate policy of the Germans. Base rates have
been reduced from 10 per cent to 6 per cent and the UK economy has shown
signs of recovery.
Could there be a similar effect in Europe? Investor euphoria has been
distinctly muted so far. Whereas the FT-SE 100 index rose 9 per cent in the
week after Black Wednesday, by Thursday night the French index was only 3.8
per cent higher and the FT Europe (ex-UK) index climbed just 2.2 per cent.
We asked fund managers about their views on the effect of the ERM change on
equity and bond market investors . . .
Anthony Bolton, who manages Fidelity's European fund: 'The medium-term case
for equities is still good. European stock markets have lagged the rest of
the world. But the situation is quite unlike when we left the ERM. That was
unexpected, whereas people have been expecting change in the ERM for some
time.
'Politicians have been made to look like puppets in recent days and they may
want to re-assert themselves, so rates may not come down for a couple of
weeks.
'We continue to prefer the peripheral markets such as Italy and Scandinavia
and, in particular, Norway, one of the only markets where you're seeing some
real growth in Europe.'
Jim Campbell, of Ivory &amp; Sime, who manages the Continental Assets investment
trust: 'We recall the UK situation in 1992 where interest rates came down
sharply and the market quickly discounted the impact. This year, the market
has stood still as earnings have tried to catch up.
'In Europe, the markets have already discounted the benefits of lower rates
and price-earnings ratios are very high in France and Germany. We tend to
favour the Scandinavian markets and Italy, which were early devaluers and
will see the benefits come through sooner than France and Germany.'
Sally Tennant, manager of the Gartmore European investment trust:
'Governments haven't yet taken in the full implications of what the wider
bands mean.
'Economic fundamentals have caused the collapse of the ERM and those will
cause rate changes, whether it is over the next weeks or months. There is
greater scope for real rates to fall in France; their cost base is better
and they have companies that are very operationally geared for an upturn in
volumes.
'In Germany, a lot has been anticipated and the market is taking on trust
much of the rationalisation which will be needed.'
Stephen Peak, manager of the TR European Growth investment trust: 'All is
now focused on interest rates and whether somebody tries to break ranks and
salvage their economy by cutting rates sharply. Stock markets are
discounting some fall in short-term rates but not aggressive reductions.
'We have been underweight in Germany for some time, with a holding of below
10 per cent against an index weighting of 22-23 per cent. We are stock
selection-orientated and it is relatively more difficult to find value among
German stocks compared with the French, Spanish, Italian or Swedish markets.
'We wouldn't be chasing blue chips in the short term but share prices of
smaller companies have lagged, as they usually do, and offer better value.'
Peter Geikie-Cobb, who runs Mercury's Global Bond unit trusts, notes that
European governments still seem very keen to keep their currencies within
their old ERM bands. 'The longer this goes on, the better it is for the bond
market because it will be very damaging for the European economy. What the
continental Europeans haven't yet learned is that the UK has had very little
inflationary impact from the pound's devaluation.
'We have been buying European bonds and hedging them into dollars. We have
16 per cent of the portfolio in Spanish bonds, where the peseta has been
devalued heavily with very little effect on inflation, 10 per cent in
France, 24 per cent in the UK and 14 per cent in Holland, which has the
stability of the D-mark without the costs of reunification.
'Unemployment is high across Europe and wage pressures are, accordingly,
very low. Inflation is not much of a threat for the next two to three years.
'Bond markets represent as good value as they did two to three years ago,
because all that has happened is that nominal bond yields have fallen in
line with inflation; real yields have remained high.'
Howard Flight, of Guinness Flight: 'The main practical economic implications
of the events of the past 10 days are that interest rates elsewhere in
Europe can now be reduced substantially in accordance with economic needs,
irrespective of whether or not the Bundesbank reduces German rates.
'We can, therefore, expect French and Italian, and probably Spanish,
short-term interest rates to fall by 2 or 3 per cent more by the end of the
year.
'This is why European equity markets have reacted positively, as they are
now able to perceive a route to economic recovery from lower interest rates.
Inflation is likely to reduce further, permitting European bond markets to
strengthen further as short term interest rates fall.
'The extent of D-mark strength against other European currencies is likely
to be limited and of relatively short duration. The real economic problems
facing Germany are considerably worse than those elsewhere in Europe.
'Sooner or later, Germany is likely to face a major currency crisis. The
abandonment of the ERM bands may have postponed this by six to nine months
but, when it comes, it is likely to be worse than otherwise, to the extent
that Germany's uncompetitive economic patterns will worsen further.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: So many questions - The big building
society merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN TWO of the UK's largest building societies announce they are to merge,
their 7.3m customers are entitled to ask what it means for them. But they
will get few answers at the moment from the Leeds or the National &amp;
Provincial, which plan to tie the knot by next spring.
If the move is approved by their 3.3m members, the resulting society would
be the UK's third largest. The two say a merger is the best way to get the
investment needed to provide higher levels of customer service through 'an
expanded range of products and services'. By combining, they will have a
wider distribution network as well.
They are, however, unable to say yet what the expanded range would comprise.
'The announcement of the merger has come before we are able to answer a lot
of questions,' said Mark Whiting, of the Leeds. 'But speculation regarding
the merger was getting rampant and we decided to make an open statement.'
What is certain is that there will be fewer branches, with the 769 they have
now being reduced to between 600-700.
The societies stress that this is a genuine merger and not a takeover of N &amp;
P by the Leeds. N &amp; P will lose its name - the merged society will be known
as the Leeds Permanent - but its distinctive bee logo will remain and its
chief executive, David O'Brien, will take up the same position in the new
society.
Savers
Building societies are owned by their members and in recent years, when a
smaller society was swallowed by a larger one, a bonus has often been given,
partly as compensation for handing over ownership to members of a larger
society.
Bonus payments are a recent innovation, though: it was Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester which set the trend when it took over the Guardian building
society in 1989.
Since the Leeds/N &amp; P deal is not a takeover, members may find expectations
of a bonus misplaced. A final decision depends on the level of reserves and
the effect on the society's capital ratios.
Some savings accounts will certainly disappear since the two societies say
they will be eliminating duplication. N &amp; P is one of the few societies to
have committed itself to telling investors when an account is closed and
replaced by a new one. It says the merged society is almost certain to
continue this policy.
At the moment, the level of interest paid by each society on its savings
accounts is similar. Each, for instance, offers 5.6 per cent gross on Pounds
25,000 in its instant access account, so savers should not be affected
unduly.
Borrowers
People on fixed rate mortgages from either society should not see any
change. Both societies claim they were among the first in the fixed rate
market and say they are committed to providing innovative products. The
standard variable rate at both is 7.99 per cent.
Where the two differ most is on their policy towards credit cards. Visa
cardholders at N &amp; P do not pay an annual charge but this could change since
the Leeds has a Pounds 12 fee. Interest rates at N &amp; P are lower, too: 21.6
APR compared with 22.4 at Leeds.
N &amp; P was also the first society to issue credit cards with photographs in
an attempt to beat fraud. It says this is 'exactly the kind of innovative
service and product which we would not want to lose' after the merger.
N &amp; P will be writing to its customers within the next week and has set up a
free customer helpline for those with queries: 0800-404 041.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: The summer dog days bite back - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE should be the dog days of August for US stock markets, a period when
dealers and investors enjoy short, quiet weeks and long, quiet weekends.
Instead, the dogs of August are up and yapping at everybody's heels.
Last week it was the near-collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism
that kept the markets on edge. This week it was the near-collapse of an
overheated gold market, and the final lap of an exhausting and nail-biting
budget marathon that saw President Clinton's much-ballyhooed
deficit-reduction plan stagger toward the finishing line with the result
still in doubt.
Somewhat surprisingly, share prices have managed to hold their own amid all
the fuss, many posting modest gains along the way. The secondary markets
were especially resilient, with the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks on its way yesterday to establishing a new record
high on three consecutive days. Equities were helped by a strong bond
market, which kept bond yields close to their record lows of just over 6.5
per cent.
The week's economic news also provided some support for stocks. The data was
not especially encouraging, but at least it was not discouraging.
Yesterday's July employment report was broadly in line with expectations.
Non-farm payrolls rose 162,000, which was what analysts had been predicting,
and the national unemployment rate dropped from 7 per cent to 6.8 per cent.
That was a bigger fall than forecast, but economists were quick to point out
that the bulk of the fall was due to a decline in the labour force, rather
than any upturn in job creation.
After the employment figures had been digested, analysts said their views on
the economy had not changed - it is growing, but growing slowly.
If the week's economic fundamentals were rather flat, the political
fundamentals were humming. President Bill Clinton and his aides spent all
week frantically trying to garner enough support for his budget to ensure
its approval by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
As of midday yesterday, the economic plan, which the President hopes will
cut the deficit by nearly Dollars 500bn over the next five years, had
squeaked through the House by two votes. Although the Senate was expected to
pass it by an equally narrow majority (the vote was due late last night), no
one was ruling out the possibility of the plan falling at the final hurdle.
The financial markets have been spellbound by the drama of the budget
negotiations and voting, not necessarily because the success or failure of
the President's plan would have a big impact on the economy, but because the
budget's fate will have a big impact on sentiment.
Defeat in Congress would be a serious blow to Clinton's presidency, and
might leave his administration politically crippled - the worst possible
outcome for stock and bond markets. In a narrower sense, defeat would
probably lead to a sharp sell-off in the bond market, because in the past
few months Treasury investors have bought a lot of bonds in expectation that
the budget - the first serious attempt by a US administration to tackle the
huge federal deficit - would be passed.
A sharp drop in bond prices would almost certainly trigger heavy selling of
stocks, which have been sustained for most of this year by low interest
rates. In this regard, there is little doubt that the stock markets want the
President's budget passed. Yet victory in Congress will not send investors
into a wild frenzy of celebration. The consensus of analysts' opinion is
that the tax-raising, expenditure-cutting plan will hinder, not help, growth
over the short-term, and there are many on Wall Street and beyond who are
not happy at the prospect of paying higher taxes, either on payday or at the
petrol pump.
If it were not for the fuss over the budget, Thursday's extraordinary plunge
in gold prices would have been the week's big story. Earlier this year, the
sharp rise in gold prices had unsettled stock and bond markets, which feared
that investors were rushing to buy gold, the traditional safe-haven in
inflationary times, because they expected an imminent surge in US and
worldwide inflation.
Yet, the sudden reversal in gold's fortunes (prompted primarily by the
restoration of order to Europe's besieged monetary system) left the stock
markets cold, although it did provide a brief boost to bonds. Either equity
investors think the gold price is no longer especially important now that
domestic inflation seems to be back under control, or they do not believe
gold's five-month rally is really over.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: Top of the class, for now - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE stock market were a school class, banks' traditional seat would be at
the back. But after a couple of decades of flicking paper pellets and
creating trouble, the banks have pushed themselves to the front. A year of
exceptional study has left teachers amazed at their transformation.
Amazed, but still watchful over whether the new star pupils are about to
relapse into their old ways. This might be the appropriate attitude for the
investor looking at bank shares. The FT-A bank sector has outperformed the
FT-A All Share by 30 per cent over the past year. It is time to take stock.
There are three possibilities: banks will continue to outperform because of
improved earnings and the ability to raise dividends; they will drop back as
the traditional rally out of recession subsides; or their shares will start
to perform differently as their performance diverges.
The interim earnings figures announced this week provide some clues as to
what to expect. The straightforward profit figures appeared very good, with
both Midland Bank - now a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings ' and Barclays raising
pre-tax profits sixfold on the first six months of last year.
But profits are not a good guide, for two reasons. One is that banks are
rebounding from poor pre-tax figures - in Barclays' case a full-year loss in
1992 ' largely caused by debt provisions. National Westminster's provisions
fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 641m as the recovery took hold.
The second is that clearing banks are such large, complicated businesses
that their total profits are a mixture of elements. The core franchise of
branch-based lending can contribute less than other parts, such as the
investment bank arms or the sale of other retail financial products.
Three elements of the results were notable:
Banks made strong profits in foreign exchange and capital markets, both
because of currency volatility and because it has been a good time for
securities houses handling bond and equity issues. These earnings are
vulnerable in the second half of the year, although conditions remain
favourable.
Banking business in the UK came under pressure. There was flat and even
falling demand for loans, and the fall in base rates cut income on deposits,
narrowing the 'spread' between interest earned on assets and paid on
liabilities. The only bright part was growth in mortgages.
Signs started to emerge of banks becoming over-capitalised. This is a
departure, since banks' capital has been depleted in the past two years by
their inability to make enough money to retain earnings after paying
dividends. Barclays retained earnings of Pounds 84m, its first such earnings
in two years.
Lloyds Bank has achieved more consistent earnings, adding Pounds 171m to
capital this half-year. It already has a strong ratio of capital to assets
and Brian Pitman, its chief executive, was driven to muse this week about
returning its spare cash to shareholders in some form.
Beyond the figures, there is the sense that bank management is better than
it was. Bank executives were emphasising this week that their traditional
competition just to be bigger is over. Instead, they are now concentrating
on return on equity, and are prepared to ditch poor businesses.
What does all this mean for shares? Slippage against outperformance depends
above all on whether the star pupils really have changed their ways. The
rise of banks of the past year has been based both on the expectation of
recovery, and confidence in management. The earnings recovery element of
outperformance was largely thought to have discounted six months ago. But
Barclays and NatWest, both bought on recovery prospects, have performed well
since. The possibility of more growth for such banks - and probably for the
sector - depends on earnings.
This week's results sent mixed messages. Although the very strong securities
earnings pushed up NatWest and HSBC, the underlying slackness of loan demand
raised questions over banks' core profitability. Worries over banking
earnings may mean sector outperformance will not continue.
The competence of management will be watched closely. Barclays has provoked
debate by promising to find a new chief executive role, and this week
unveiled a surprise Pounds 285m US loss. Further accidents could undermine
the improved reputation of managements and affect sentiment.
The sense that banks' outperformance may have peaked means that analysts are
advising investors to switch among bank shares. Playing safe would imply
concentrating on dividend yields. This may involve switching toward
well-capitalised banks, such as Lloyds or TSB, that may hand back cash.
The riskier play would be to stick with the market's faith in the recovery
potential of banks such as Barclays and NatWest. This means not only
believing that earnings will continue to stay strong, but that poor pupils
have mended their ways. Teachers get paid for faith; investors may be, or
they may not.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: Risks of joining the gold rush - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOP seven performing unit trusts in July were gold funds and over the
past year, an investor in Mercury Gold &amp; General could have trebled his
money. Even Waverley Australasian Gold, which for a long time propped up the
unit trust performance tables, gave investors an 122.6 per cent return over
the year to August.
If you spotted the gold rally a year, or even six months, ago,
congratulations. But the true nature of the gold market was illustrated this
week when the bullion price suddenly plummeted. Having reached Dollars 409
per ounce on Monday, the metal touched Dollars 372 at one point on Thursday.
It is easy to be blinded by science with talk of the Chinese enthusiasm for
gold, its 'safe haven' status in times of turbulence, such as the ERM crisis
and the like. The fact is that gold is just a commodity, and a commodity
where there is the equivalent of 10 years' demand stored away in government
and central bank vaults.
A world gold council report, published on Thursday, showed that there was a
significant slackening of demand in the Middle Eastern and Indian markets
during the second quarter of this year. However, it was not that report, but
rumours that the Chinese central bank was offloading gold, which helped
provoke Thursday's price fall.
Prices are still well above the Dollars 330 per ounce level, where they
stood at the start of the current rally. The market had been dead for so
long that it was almost the ultimate contrarian play; combine that with the
reputation of the world's current favourite financial guru, George Soros,
and the desire of some US investment funds to find fresh homes for their
money and you had the recipe for a bull run.
But a rally built on sentiment can falter on the same emotion. It is really
difficult to see how gold can be a sensible home for the long-term money of
private investors. The metal itself pays no income and even though gold
mining shares offer a dividend yield, many of those are concentrated in the
politically sensitive market of South Africa. Even if you were worried about
inflation (and believe, in the face of little recent evidence, that gold is
a reliable hedge against it), there are better vehicles for protecting
yourself, such as index-linked gilts.
Over the last 10 years, the best-performing gold unit trust has returned
just 85 per cent, compared with 139.7 per cent from the worst-performing UK
equity income fund. So by all means punt on the gold market, if you are
sufficiently wealthy, and can afford to risk 5 per cent of your portfolio;
there may well be further profitable short term gyrations in the market. But
for long term, serious investments stick to bonds and equities.
*****
EVERY TIME journalists highlight the benefits of fee-based, rather than
commission- related, advice, we receive aggrieved letters from advisers who
feel we are maligning the standards of their profession.
Surveys such as the one recently conducted by the consumer magazine, Which?,
show why journalists stick to their guns. Which? sent researchers to 30
banks, building societies, insurance company representatives and independent
financial advisers to ask for advice on investing a Pounds 25,000 lump sum
redundancy payment.
The researchers were asked to make it clear that they had no job lined up,
and no source of income other than the Pounds 25,000 lump sum. According to
Which?, and it is hard to disagree, the best advice for such a person is to
put the money into a savings account until their employment situation is
clear. After all, they may well need to live off their capital.
Even so, half of those approached recommended that the researchers invest
anything from Pounds 3,000 to the full Pounds 25,000 in an investment bond.
This buys units in a fund run by an insurance company and could easily fall
in value, if the stock market declines. Furthermore, there is a charge of 5
per cent which is likely to result in a loss for investors if they withdraw
their money early.
So why were investment bonds so widely recommended? Which? argues that the
reason was commission - advisers can earn around Pounds 1,400 for selling a
Pounds 25,000 bond. If they recommend putting money into a building society
account, they will probably get nothing.
Two-thirds of the advisers did not ask what risk the client was prepared to
take and nine failed to say whether they were tied to one specific insurer
or were independent. Some advisers, says Which?, made statements which were
factually wrong or misleading such as assertions that investment bonds are
tax-free or risk-free.
Small samples can be misleading and I am sure that there are many very good
commission-based advisers. Nevertheless, we believe that paying advisers a
fee avoids many of the problems described above. Readers can obtain a list
of fee-based advisers in their area by writing to our sister publication:

FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: Dealers look back to a bright future - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A FUNNY thing happened in the government bond market this week
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the FT Government Securities index regained the level it last saw in April
1955.
Admitedly the index is an elderly yardstick, calculated since 1926, and one
which has been overtaken by newer measures. But to remember the last
occasion when the old index stood at 100 you have to be a pretty mature bond
dealer. (And, in passing, what is the difference between a bond and a bond
dealer? The bond eventually matures. The old jokes are the best . . . )
Back in April 1955, when Sir Anthony Eden was prime minister and John Major
was just trying on his first pair of long trousers, the yield on industrial
equities was 6.2 per cent and that on consols was 4.2 per cent. The stock
market had not yet discovered that equities merited a lower yield than
gilts, and it was not until the late 1950s that the 'reverse yield gap'
appeared.
Inflation in April 1955 was running at around 2 per cent, bank rate was 3.8
per cent and UK gross domestic product grew by 3 1/2 per cent that year. (I
am indebted for the 1955 numbers to Mark Brown, who is not an elderly bond
dealer but UK strategist at UBS, the brokers.) Now base rates are 6 per
cent, the yield on the Footsie index is 3.9 per cent and consols are
yielding nearly twice that.
Does the gilt index's return to its 1955 level mean that the UK economy has
awoken from the nightmare of double-digit inflation? That entrancing
prospect is partly behind the strength of the gilt market of late.
Well, inflation is low at present, but it is expected to rise - although not
to dizzy heights. Economic growth is reviving, and while that leads to
increased productivity, unit wage costs should not rise.
However, that does not mean equity yields should rise above gilt yields once
more. It might, however, mean that index-linked gilts are cheap, offering
real yields of over 3 per cent and security if inflation does run out of
control again.
The other momentous event this week was the virtual collapse of the ERM,
agreed early on Monday.
The excitement over the ERM is because the rest of Europe has untied its
economies from the inflation-controlling restrictions of German monetary
policy, supposedly allowing a quicker return to growth. Is it likely,
without German rectitude, that inflation can be held at bay? The equity
market is the way to enjoy economic growth and get a hedge against
inflation. Since sterling left the ERM last September the Footsie index has
risen by a quarter.
Strangely, given the fuss made last weekend, nothing very much happened this
week in European interest or exchange rates, and the continental economies
are still in recession. Germany shaved its money market rates, but French
interest rates were not cut and the franc did not collapse. Sterling barely
rose against the D-mark.
What did change was expectations. From the UK point of view the most
important one was that interest rates will come down sooner than had been
thought. Not fast, and not far, but many now expect base rate to be 5 per
cent by the year-end.
That lifted the equity market, which has had a terrific run in the last
fortnight, starting in anticipation of the ERM collapse, and breaking out
from the trading range in which the Footsie has been stuck since Easter.
This week it reached a new closing all time high, at 2969.8, up nearly 150
points over the last two weeks.
Any bears left have been nastily squeezed in the run. And those who thought
August was a good time to be on holiday have missed out on the action.
The other hope is that European economies will recover faster, and since
more than 60 per cent of UK exports go to continental European countries
that is good news for the equity market.
On the other hand, if sterling rises against the European currencies, the
negative translation effect, as well as the relative loss of
competitiveness, could outweigh the gains.
All this is raising hopes that the forthcoming round of interim results from
companies will lead to upward revisions of earnings forecasts for the rest
of this year and next. That could underpin a further run in the equity
market.
It even allows Nomura Research Institute, which is forecasting a year-end
target for the Footsie of 3500 - higher than most commentators, who are
looking for 3100 to 3300 - to argue that on its estimate of the p/e for 1994
of 13, the UK market is still cheap.
Corporate news this week has been, in the main, positive. The banks, of
which more below, showed an improving trend in provisions, as one would hope
as the economy recovers. Oil companies, BP and Shell, both reported better
profits from their oil activities, although chemicals let them down.
Better news came from the industrial heartland. TI Group, Glynwed and T
Cowie all raised interim profits and GKN managed to maintain pre-tax profits
in its half year, at Pounds 60m, despite a Pounds 6m rise in restructuring
costs and poor demand in continental Europe.
The UK car market has produced much better demand, and August car sales have
started well. That helps Cowie, the motor trader and leasing group, which
increased profits 28 per cent in its first half. TI, with the benefit of its
Dowty acquisition, raised profits 25 per cent. Glynwed profits were 19 per
cent higher.
But Gareth Davies, Glynwed's chairman, spoke for many when he said the
profit growth came from cost reductions and increased market share, rather
than any rise in economic activity. That is still to come.

HOUSE prices rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.9 per cent in July after falls
in May and June, according to the Halifax house price index. Nationwide
found that prices rose by 0.7 per cent in July, the fifth monthly rise in
succession according to its index.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that
the housing market was slowly recovering and that recent mortgage lending
figures were 'very encouraging'. The figures released by the council this
week show that net new lending rose to Pounds 4.1bn in the second quarter,
up from Pounds 2.9bn in the first quarter. However, the second quarter
figure is still lower than the Pounds 5.2bn of net new advances for the same
period last year.

FT  07 AUG 93 / The Long View: Freedom to diverge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THIS week's confused celebrations of the demise of the European
Monetary System the question remains, have European countries carelessly
thrown away their anti-inflationary anchor? Will we soon come to think,
perhaps the Bundesbank was not so bad after all? And who would have
predicted that on the day the structure effectively broke up the bond
markets would jump for joy?
Inflation, it is true, is not a near-term problem. At present even a
substantial devaluation will not stimulate it, as the UK has shown over the
past 10 months. But inflation quietly gathers its strength and then springs
out again. During the whole period since sterling was floated in 1972 UK
inflation has averaged 9.3 per cent a year. If the only thing that has led
to the latest slowdown is a high rate of unemployment and an unusual degree
of uncertainty in the labour market, we must expect inflation to return when
the economy stages a decent recovery.
If the worst comes to the worst, Europe is potentially open to an alarming
war of low interest rates, competitive devaluations and beggar-my-neighbour
economic strategies.
But those who persuasively argue that inflation is no longer a problem are
winning. In the Western industrialised countries this does indeed seem
largely true, for the time being anyway. In the 24 countries that make up
the OECD club inflation averaged 3.0 per cent last year and is forecast to
slip to 2.8 per cent for 1993. Ironically Germany is one of the worst
performers with 4.3 per cent at present, which has been the cause of most of
the recent trouble.
But look around the world and you will find that money is still far too
often a sick joke. In Russia inflation is 20 per cent a month, and in Brazil
it is 30 per cent; together these countries have populations approaching
that of the EC. In China, with over 1bn people, inflation year-on-year is 14
per cent, if you believe it, and could be accelerating. Such inflation rates
in the developing world may serve to explain why the gold price has been
climbing even though Western inflation is so subdued.
The two worlds, industrialised and developing, are interacting on a much
larger scale than in the past, though Japan provided some precedents in
barging into the rich men's club a decade or two ago. Fierce price
competition in manufactured goods has suppressed inflation in the West and
has led to widespread job losses. Overall, growth has remained low enough to
leave most commodity prices still weak. Eventually growth, in China in
particular, will mop up surpluses, oil being the most obvious candidate for
an uncomfortably changed supply-demand balance in a few years in the future.
In the East, inflation is still moderately high because of the rapid
economic growth rate and the advances in real incomes.
There is something of a repeat here of the experience of Japan. Rapid
productivity growth in manufacturing meant that stable export prices were
combined with relatively rapid internal price inflation: during the 1960s
Japanese wholesale prices hardly budged, but consumer prices rose at 6 per
cent a year. By the 1980s economic growth had slowed and inflation
decelerated.
There is the curious case of Hong Kong, a fast-growing offshoot of China
which has adopted the US dollar as its currency. Traded goods are priced in
dollars, so rapidly rising incomes have to be reflected in surging prices of
non-traded domestic services, and whereas the US has inflation of 3 per cent
Hong Kong's consumer prices are rising at about 9 per cent. There is no
opportunity here to allow the currency to appreciate so that traded goods
prices might fall domestically, which in a slightly different context has
been happening in Japan over the past year (during which period the yen has
appreciated by 41 per cent against the D-Mark).
As for Europe, there has been the awkward coincidence of loss of
international competitiveness against the newly industrialising countries
and the attempt by the Bundesbank to fight internal inflationary shocks
through a tight monetary policy and an overvalued D-Mark - imposing the same
solution willy-nilly on Germany's EMS partners.
One response in Europe could be protectionism, but that impulse has been
surprisingly well resisted so far. If labour markets were flexible the real
exchange rate could be lowered through real pay reductions, as has happened
in the US. But this is not Europe's way. The only other route out of
Europe's deflation is through devaluation and sharply lower interest rates.
For the time being the inflationary risks of this strategy are being
discounted. Bond prices across Europe jumped with the collapse of the EMS,
because the implication is that interest rates will fall, and a rise in bond
prices is the means by which investors reconcile themselves to lower yields.
Both nominal and real bond yields appear to be falling. As long-term
interest rates fall the value of assets such as equities and property will
tend to rise. This is another reason for gold's come-back, given that the
opportunity cost of holding it is falling (although it does not yet have any
inflationary hedge appeal for European or US investors).
We cannot yet see clearly ahead. The Franco-German dream of European union
has collapsed, and economic convergence has halted. As for the inflationary
consequences, the problem perhaps is not so much that the answer will be bad
as that the answers will be different. Instead of converging on the German
level, bond interest rates across the EC must be regarded as potentially
much more volatile, and indeed bond yields in the soundest economies,
notably France, have the opportunity to stay significantly below those in
fiscally troubled Germany.
Bond dealers will eagerly welcome this reopening of Pandora's Box; the rest
of us will less enthusiastically recognise that we are better off without a
straightjacket.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIDNIGHT in Manhattan. In a basement club in the heart of America's most
sophisticated metropolis, couples in cowboy hats and boots are strutting to
country dances with hick-sounding names like the Texas two-step, honky tonk
stomp and boot-scootin' boogie.
A glittering cowboy saddle, plated with mirrored glass, revolves from the
ceiling. Other icons of the American west are scattered throughout the hall
 -painted wagon wheels, cacti, stuffed animal heads - while television sets
show black-and-white film of Hollywood cowboy stars riding into Last Chance
Gulch.
Suddenly, the dancers form in rows for one of the popular new country 'line'
dances: a few steps to the left, a few to the right, and then a corkscrewing
leg kick. It looks a little like a slow-motion aerobics class performed in
western fancy dress. This is Denim &amp; Diamonds, a nightclub which opened
recently within tobacco-spitting distance of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel,
bringing a national boom in country music and dancing into the centre of
culturally sniffy New York City.
Country music's revenue share of US record sales soared from 8.8 per cent in
1990 to 16.5 per cent in 1992 and singer Garth Brooks, the biggest
phenomenon to hit country music in decades, was America's top-selling record
artist in any category last year. More than 2,600 radio stations - a quarter
of the US total - now feature country music. Boosters in Nashville,
Tennessee, the centre of the industry, claim it is the most popular radio
format in 57 of America's top 100 cities, many of them outside country's
traditional base in the south and west.
Now, Nashville is hoping to conquer the rest of the world. Japan, which
watches American fashions closely, already has its first all-country radio
station and Country Music Television (CMT), a cable channel showing non-stop
country music videos, began transmissions in Britain and other European
countries last autumn.
Turning Europe on will not be easy, though. In the UK, for example, country
has a thoroughly negative image as middle-of-the road music with corny
lyrics about irrelevant, rural Americana, performed by rhinestone-encrusted
hayseeds with funny names, funny accents and even more risible hairstyles.
'Candidly, I don't think you can just dump a wheelbarrow full of big cowboy
hats and belt buckles in the centre of Europe and start a trend,' says Roy
Wunsch, who heads Sony Music's Nashville operation. The industry, he
suggests, will have to exercise a degree of subtlety as it introduces
artists to the continent.
Yet Europe's image of country is seriously out of date. The music has
changed much over the past few years, which helps explain why it is enjoying
such a boom in the US and why it could, conceivably, appeal to a wider
European audience. Nashville has discovered a new generation of young,
sexy-looking musicians who are singing songs with broader appeal than in the
past and who can be marketed nationally using a powerful new medium: cable
television.
The Nashville Network TV channel was dismissed as a sure-fire failure by
much of the entertainment industry when it started 10 years ago. But it is
now one of the most popular US cable outlets, with programmes that cover not
just music but other aspects of life dear to the country-loving American:
country-style cooking, motor mechanics, bass fishing, drag racing, hunting,
trucking and rodeo. Its sister network, Country Music Television, is one of
the fastest-growing US networks, pumping out non-stop videos of the latest
country hits.
Another reason for the music's success seems to be the sheer weakness and
fractured nature of other pop formats. Many Americans find it hard to relate
to the rap music of the black ghettoes, the uncompromising neo-punk sounds
of grunge rock, or the tired themes of heavy metal. Ageing baby-boomers, who
like their music tuneful and none too rebellious, find some of the modern
country sounds reassuringly similar to the country-rock and folk rock
performed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by groups such as The Band and
The Eagles.
Around Nashville, enthusiasts like to quote a remark attributed, possibly
apocryphally, to the British pop star Elton John: 'Rock 'n' roll hasn't
died, it's just gone country.' That is an exaggeration, although rock 'n'
roll did itself spring partly from country roots: Elvis Presley began as a
country singer and is still claimed as such (somewhat cheekily) by the
Nashville establishment. Presley's genius was to fuse white country sounds
with the black rhythm and blues of the Mississippi delta.
Often called 'white man's blues,' country music can trace its origins to the
poor small-holders, many from the Scots-English border country, who settled
the southern Appalachian mountains in the 18th century, bringing with them a
tradition of folk ballads which became entwined with other eclectic musical
elements. The music became commercialised in the 1920s when radio stations
began springing up across the US, some of them featuring country songs.
The most important for the development of the music was Nashville's station
WSM; its weekly show, the Grand Ole Opry, played a seminal part in
developing country artists. The Opry is still going and its folksy,
old-fashioned shows have become a much revered institution in Nashville; but
its role as a trend-setter has long since been usurped by radio stations
focusing on top country hits and, latterly, by television.
After a succession of booms in the 1950s and 1960s, country music became
stuck in a rut in the early 1980s and faced plummeting record sales. It was
dominated by middle-aged stars with a penchant for elaborate costumes, often
dripping with jewellery - 'It costs a lot to make a person look this cheap,'
quipped a sequin-covered Dolly Parton at a recent New York concert - and
old-fashioned, high-piled hairstyles. 'The higher the hair, the closer to
God,' ran one Nashville joke.
The music they performed was equally full of artifice, relying heavily on
massed strings, synthesisers, syrupy vocal choruses and excessive use of the
steel guitar, the instrument which gives country a soaring, Hawaiian-style
sound. Then, around the middle of the decade, salvation arrived in the form
of fresh young singers calling themselves 'new traditionalists.' They
rejected slickness in favour of a much simpler, more traditional sound
emphasising fiddles, guitars and a single voice.
An important early example was Storms of Life, the 1986 debut album by Randy
Travis, whose looks were as four-square and clean-cut as his singing and
whose record sold surprisingly well. Nashville scoured the south for similar
acts and has ended up with a roster of virile-looking men, known
collectively as the 'new country hunks,' who tend to dress in plain but
figure-hugging blue jeans and wear cowboy hats (hence their other nickname:
'hat acts').
Some of their names, as much as their chiselled profiles, could have been
plucked from the pages of romantic fiction: Dwight Yoakum, Clint Black,
Billy Ray Cyrus. But the most popular of all is Brooks, a man of rather
pudgy, boy-next-door good looks who, more than any country singer since
Presley, has managed to achieve what every artist prays for: 'cross-over'
status. This is industry jargon for someone who appeals to a much wider
audience than traditional country fans, and whose records are hits on the
regular pop charts as well as the ones restricted to country music. To
'cross over' is to earn very big bucks.
Brooks is so popular because he sings strongly melodic tunes with original
lyrics and delivers the package with great intensity. His musical influences
go well beyond the traditional country roster to include James Taylor, the
melancholic folk singer popular in the early 1970s, and Elton John.
In subject matter, too, Brooks' songs break new ground for country music
which used to focus on a few narrow themes, revolving mainly around the hard
times and love life of the macho, white southern male of rural,
working-class origins (known as a redneck or 'good ol' boy').
In traditional songs, his woman has left him, or fails to reciprocate his
passion, and he seeks escape from this tribulation by drinking beer (six
packs) in a bar (honky tonk); driving around in a pick-up truck (the Ford);
remembering the salt-of-the-earth goodness of his parents (Maw 'n' Paw);
praying to God (the Gewd Lawd); or thanking his lucky stars that he was born
in the south (Dixie).
Many of Brooks' songs also deal with these cliches, although he handles them
freshly. But he also sings about such delicate contemporary issues as date
rape and wife battering; and, in We Shall Be Free, he makes an appeal for
racial, sexual and religious tolerance which contrasts sharply with the
south's reputation for bigotry.
Long-time Nashville song-writer Richard Leigh, who wrote the 1977 cross-over
hit Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue, says: 'There is an urban discovery of
country music going on, so you cannot just sing about chickens and pick-up
trucks because that is not exactly within the experience of a wide variety
of people. We are not an agrarian society any more.'
Yet Nashville's much-vaunted new openness is still pretty limited. Take what
happened to the talented singer k d lang, who had an impeccable background
for a country artist. She grew up in the rural prairieland of Canada, then
tried to make a name for herself in Nashville. The industry cold-shouldered
her, partly because of her lesbianism and partly because, as a vegetarian,
she made a television commercial attacking the beef industry - an impolitic
move given the strong links between country music and cattle farming.
She, in turn, transformed herself from a country artist into a more
sophisticated mainstream performer, as have some other male artists. But for
every Garth Brooks, there are a dozen or so Nashville singers making records
with strongly traditional themes.
An example is Joe Diffie, a leading performer of 'cry in your beer' honky
tonk rock; his latest album includes songs such as I Can Walk the Line, If
it Ain't Too Straight - an appeal for his nagging woman to give him some
slack from domestic constraints. Many country songs remain cloyingly
sentimental and deeply religious, and there is a sizeable streak of kitsch
at the heart of the industry.
While country has changed, its new face might still be too parochially
middle American for most European tastes. The good ol' boys may have moved
from Mama's farm to suburbia, but they have taken a lot of down-home
sentiments with them. While this baggage gives country its sense of
individuality and history, it also circumscribes its development.

FT  07 AUG 93 / TV-am investors seek better luck with Crockfords Plc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GARRY NESBITT was trained as a tap dancer by his show business parents
but it was business he was interested in, so he took a gamble and applied
for a job at Crockfords when it opened as London's first legal casino in
1961.
As a gaming room valet dressed in 18th century breeches, he smoothed the
green baize of the tables and served chocolates to the ladies playing chemin
de fer.
Yesterday Mr Nesbitt, chairman of Crockfords, was looking forward to being
chairman of Crockfords Plc when the company is listed on the London Stock
Exchange on September 1.
It follows yesterday's reverse takeover by TV-am, the commercial breakfast
television company that gambled and lost in 1991's auction for new ITV
licences.
The deal will make Mr Nesbitt, who along the way ran casinos for Mecca and
created and sold the Our Price record chain to WH Smith for Pounds 46m, as
rich as many of the international gamblers to come to Crockfords in the
heart of London's Mayfair.
In Crockfords, under the Robert Adam ceilings of a house built in 1760, it
is possible to lose a great deal of money in the most pleasant of
surroundings and some do - Pounds 500,000 or even Pounds 1m in a single
night.
The smallest bet you can place at Crockfords is Pounds 5 on a single number
at roulette, although the Pounds 600 limit gives a better idea of what goes
on.
'You can bet more by private arrangement,' says Mr Nesbitt who then unlocks
the door of the salon privee, where the really high rollers can go if they
want solitude and silence to win or lose enormous sums.
Here, surrounded by prints and pictures, the minimum bet on the roulette
wheel is Pounds 1,000.
When Mr Nesbitt bought Crockfords in 1990 from Brent Walker for Pounds 50m
it was a huge gamble. 'It was a mid-market casino,' he says. 'It was
virtually a downmarket casino. People were playing for Pounds 2. It was
ridiculous.' His aim has been to take Crockfords up market.
Over the past three years, 10 'exceptional' players have accounted for 50
per cent of profits, which rose to almost Pounds 20m in 1992. One gambler in
his 60s accounted for no less than 40 per cent of last year's profits.
Institutions which backed TV-am and are staying to see how their luck holds
at the gaming tables must be hoping his health holds.
'London is still the gaming capital of the world,' Mr Nesbitt insists,
although Middle Eastern clients have given way in large part to the rich of
Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan.
'The British don't come. This is a 98 per cent export business. We should
get a Queen's award for exports,' says Mr Nesbitt, who hopes to buy other
casinos in London and take the Crockfords way of doing business to other
countries.
While the recession may be barely over in London casino business is starting
to boom, probably helped by sterling's devaluation. Last year turnover at
London's casinos reached Pounds 1.2bn. This year as much as Pounds 1.44bn in
chips could be put at risk on the smooth green baize.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Court rejects compensation in Hoover free flights case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RETIRED headmaster yesterday lost the first case to come to court against
Hoover over its controversial free flights promotion. But the company was
criticised by the court for 'slackness'.
Mr Sandy Jack, from Methil, Fife, was suing Hoover for Pounds 380 - the cost
of two flights to Orlando, Florida - at Kirkcaldy Sheriffs Court. In what
had been seen as a test case, Mr Jack claimed the company failed to supply
two free tickets after he bought a Pounds 350 Hoover dishwasher.
Thousands of people have made similar complaints after Hoover ran a
promotion last year offering free flights to the US and Europe if customers
spent more than Pounds 100 on its products.
Sheriff William Christie said Mr Jack was not entitled to compensation as he
had not complied with the conditions of the offer.
He ruled Hoover was 'not in material breach of contract' by failing to send
Mr Jack a ticket voucher within the 28-day time limit specified in its
rules. 'At no time did the defenders (Hoover) fail to honour their
obligation under the contract,' he said.
Mr Jack argued that Hoover had broken its contract by sending him a flight
voucher 19 days outside the 28-day limit. He did not complete the voucher
because it arrived only days before he hoped to travel.
However Sheriff Christie described as a 'blunder' Hoover's original defence
that it did not receive Mr Jack's registration form. That led to the Post
Office checking tens of thousands of receipts for proof that Mr Jack's
registered letter had been delivered. 'This situation arose from careless
drafting of the defence,' the sheriff said.
Mr Jack said yesterday: 'I may not have won the actual battle, but I think
we gave them a hell of a hammering in the war.'
Mr Richard Rankin, co-chairman of the Hoover task force sorting out the
promotion, said Mr Jack was 'representative of customers who mistakenly
believe, or are encouraged to believe, that they have a right to two free
flights when in fact they have not followed the rules and are therefore not
eligible'.
But the Consumers' Association said: 'The law clearly considers there is one
set of rules for consumers and another for Hoover.'
Hoover dismissed its European president and two directors responsible for
the promotion in March and set up a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) 'rescue'
fund. It ran into problems after underestimating the response to its offer
and the commission it would earn on associated travel bookings.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Hosokawa to take over as Japan's new PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MORIHIRO Hosokawa, the head of a seven-party coalition, was chosen as
Japan's prime minister last night, but only after the Liberal Democratic
party extended its 38-year rule by a few hours with delaying tactics that
forced a second parliamentary vote for the leadership.
'One era has finished, and another era has begun,' Mr Hosokawa said. 'I feel
a great sense of history and a heavy weight of responsibility.'
The final seal of approval comes on Monday when Mr Hosokawa formally reports
his appointment to Emperor Akihito.
Last night, Liberal Democrat MPs thumped the opposition benches for the
first time in postwar history and shouted abuse at the incoming government.
The generally conservative coalition includes Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party
and several other mainstream parties, along with the Social Democrats,
formerly the Socialist party, and Komeito, the political arm of a Buddhist
movement. All have pledged to introduce a new electoral system within a
year.
Japanese financial markets were calm in expectation of the coalition's
taking power, but business leaders warned that parliamentary delaying
tactics by the LDP in the past two days could characterise coalition rule.
Mr Hosokawa, 55, is the descendant of feudal lords and grandson of a
war-time prime minister. A former provincial governor, he formed the Japan
New party only a year ago and has risen to the premiership on a wave of
public revulsion over bribery and other scandals involving the LDP.
He said after the vote that the new government would 'look towards the
people, not towards Nagatacho (the Tokyo political district)'. He is
expected to announce his cabinet on Monday.
Mr Hosokawa's election was presided over by Ms Takako Doi, the former
socialist leader, who became the first woman to be selected as speaker of
the lower house. The first poll was declared void as MPs claimed their votes
had not been counted, and a second poll declared Mr Hosokawa's victory two
hours later.
Mr Hosokawa defeated Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president, by 262 votes to 224
votes. Two MPs voted for the SDP leader, Mr Sadao Yamahana, who was not a
candidate.
Apart from political reform, the coalition will have to deal with a
still-slowing economy, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations,
and US demands for further opening of Japan's markets. The parties have also
promised to seek a full reconciliation with other Asian countries by clearly
apologising for war-time aggression.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Advance payments could avoid VAT on fuel bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEGAL LOOPHOLE could enable British consumers to avoid paying value added
tax on domestic fuel, if they pay their gas or electricity bills in advance
before VAT is imposed next April.
Chantrey Vellacott, a London accountancy firm, has calculated that if
customers paid London Electricity Pounds 1,500 - enough to cover two years'
average bills - they could save almost Pounds 200, more than they would earn
in interest at current building society rates.
As the law stands, payments in advance for goods to be supplied incur the
VAT charge applicable at the time of payment rather than at the time of
supply. So payments made before VAT is imposed at the start of the next tax
year would be zero-rated. From April 1994, 8 per cent VAT will be added to
domestic fuel bills, with the rate rising to 17.5 per cent a year later.
Maurice Fitzpatrick, a VAT practitioner at Chantrey Vellacott, said the
loophole was used in 1984 when VAT was imposed on home improvements.
Householders who paid in advance for work carried out after VAT became
chargeable were found not to be liable for VAT.
British Gas yesterday confirmed that the loophole existed and that customers
could use it. But it said it would not be promoting the loophole as an
opportunity to save tax, in spite of the fact that substantial advance
payments would bring cash-flow advantages to the company.
East Midlands Electricity said: 'We are happy to accept prepayment of bills
and have always done so. In terms of any scheme or any encouragement with
VAT looming, we have no plans to do that at present.'
However, if too many consumers decide to exploit the ruse, the prospect of
losing much-needed revenue could prompt the government to close the
loophole.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TV-am's shareholders must be well aware of the dangers of betting following
the TV franchise auction. That may not stop them taking advantage of this
terrible instinct in others by backing the reverse takeover by Crockfords
casino. Doing so, however, is a pure punt. And anybody who doubts that
gambling is a mug's game would do well to peruse Crockfords' profits record.
Last year the casino made operating margins of 45 per cent. Over a long
period, it becomes clear that the house always wins. Nevertheless, with 40
per cent of last year's profits dependent on one particularly ill-starred
high roller, Crockfords brings a new dimension to the concept of earnings
volatility. As much as 5 per cent of Crockfords' annual profits can be won
or lost in one night. It is astonishing that TV-am's respectable list of
institutional investors seem so keen to sink money into such an inherently
unpredictable business.
The 7 1/2 per cent yield on the new shares certainly has its attractions.
The shares are also likely to command a premium when they start trading. But
how sustainable the yield will be is entirely dependent on Lady Luck.
Crockfords will seek to lessen the risks by buying other casinos. Even so,
Crockfords is hardly one for widows and orphans. Indeed, it might not even
be for the married and contented. TV-am's more cautious shareholders should
cash in their meagre chips before the game begins.

FT  07 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins Appleton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wobbles in the exchange rate mechanism have caused a scratching of heads
in the City and a reshuffling of portfolios. UK companies with a big
exposure to mainland Europe are swinging back into fashion in anticipation
of interest rate cuts. One of the most striking beneficiaries has been Arjo
Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper company, which derives more than
half its sales from mainland Europe.
This is appealing but, in AWA's case at least, the benefits may take a long
time to materialise. Despite the currency turmoil, neither the French franc
nor interest rates have yet fallen much. Even if they do, the paper market
is likely to remain rough. The European industry is still plagued by
overcapacity. The D-Mark price of many paper grades fell again last month.
The Nordic producers, which have become far more cost competitive following
currency devaluations, appear more inclined to add volume than widen
margins. This pricing vice has particularly squeezed the French paper
industry: Finnish paper exports to France shot up by two-thirds in the first
five months of the year. This competitive position may soon change; the
pricing pressures, though, are unlikely to abate.
AWA has proved more resilient than most manufacturers due to its higher
value papers and strong distribution network. Yet the resilience suggests
its earnings recovery will be less pronounced than those of commodity
producers.

FT  07 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the welter of information produced by the clearing banks this week,
some trends are clear. UK bad debt provisions are on a downward trend:
taking the four large clearers together they fell by 23 per cent in the
first half of this year compared with the same period of 1992. The other
good news was that the four managed to push up dealing profits by a
collective 85 per cent. Strip this out, though, and the trend in operating
income looks weak. The increase in dealing profits accounts for nearly half
the gain in gross operating income. Net operating income rose by a modest 20
per cent.
The stock market must now decide whether this warrants a recent sectoral
outperformance far greater than at the end of the last recession. On the
income side there must be doubts. Loan demand is weak and net interest
receipts could be further squeezed by lower base rates. Dealing profits may
hold up reasonably well, despite the general perception that they are
unreliable. The prospect of exchange rate volatility combines with a
positive outlook for European bond and equity markets. In such an
environment, Lloyds starts to look less clever for turning its back on
securities after big bang.
Since interest rates look set to stay low, provisions could fall faster than
in past recessions. That would compensate for slower operating profit growth
than hitherto assumed. But what the banking sector badly lacks is a revival
in loan demand. The kind of economic background in which that emerged would
also bring higher recoveries on bad property loans. There is no sign of it
yet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hope deferred is, apparently, more enjoyable than hope realised. That at
least seems to be the conclusion of the UK equity market since continental
interest rate cuts faded into the indefinite future, yet UK share prices
rallied to all-time highs. In part that is a more sober realisation that
continental governments will take time to adjust to their new found freedom.
Clearly the French government had not prepared any more of a fall-back plan
than the UK had when it was ejected from the system last September. Weighing
desire for economic stimulus against the appearance of monetary rectitude
will take some time.
Yet with inflationary forces very subdued, cuts in continental rates can
only be a matter of time. When continental rates start to fall, and if
sterling begins to strengthen, UK rates can decline further. Equities have
discounted that now the FT-SE 100 Index has moved decisively above its
2800-2900 trading range, and there must be concern over the high valuation
of the market.
Low interest rates and low inflation certainly help support high equity
multiples. With little incentive to hold cash, equity yields just below 4
per cent have an attraction, even though dividend growth will be sluggish.
Ratings which look daunting may thus be maintained and even pushed a little
higher. Yet with overseas earners, recovery stocks and financials all having
powered the rise since sterling left the ERM, and even stores having bounced
from their recent lows, it is difficult to see which sectors will provide
the energy for a substantial run. Perhaps the scatter of winners and losers
in September's interim reporting season will provide the clues.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Lopez asked for 'clear statement' by VW board

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, was
last night asked to make a 'clear statement' on allegations that he stole
industrial secrets from his former employer, General Motors of the US.
The call came from Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the state of Lower
Saxony, which owns 19.7 per cent of the troubled automotive group.
Mr Lopez, with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, was called to speak at a
crisis meeting of the company's non-executive supervisory board last night.
Mr Schroder's press spokesman said the prime minister still assumed that
affidavits from Mr Lopez, denying theft of GM secrets, were valid. If there
was anything more to be said to the charges, however, it had to be said at
the meeting.
At the same time, Mr Piech, who was accused of damaging Germany's reputation
in his attacks on General Motors, was called on by the board's four-member
presidium to tell the board when he expected the company to return to
profit. Doubts have grown about the validity of Mr Piech's claims that the
group will break even this year. Industry analysts suggest VW will be making
losses of between DM500m (Pounds 194.5m) and DM1bn.
While VW continued to say Mr Lopez's job was not at risk, Mr Schroder's
demands suggested the director had still not fully convinced all 20
supervisory board members. Less than two weeks ago, Mr Schroder declared
full confidence in both executives as 'men of honour'.
Workers' representatives from both groups yesterday warned that the 'war'
between VW and Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and focused on Mr Lopez,
endangered jobs and profits.
Mr Klaus Volkert, a member of the VW supervisory board, and his counterpart
from Opel, Mr Rudolf Muller, yesterday called on both groups to do
everything to prevent further escalation.
Mr Muller asked Mr Piech to suspend Mr Lopez until the espionage case had
been concluded. Mr Volkert, however, has said he should continue to work
'like the rest of us' to earn his pay.

FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises in advance of
budget vote
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
Good economic news and a sharp rise in Eastman Kodak shares helped US stock
markets post modest gains yesterday, in spite of continued doubt over the
fate of President Bill Clinton's first budget, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.46 at 3,560.43. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.55 firmer at 448.68, while
the Amex composite finished up 0.81 at 436.34, and the Nasdaq composite up
2.58 at 718.08, a new record. Trading volume on the NYSE was 222m shares.
The week ended with the markets' attention focused on Washington DC, where
Mr Clinton was fighting to ensure that his first budget passes through
Congress. Although the House of Representatives narrowly approved his
deficit-reduction package on Thursday night, the senate was not due to vote
until late on Friday night.
Although most observers expected the budget to be passed, the outcome of the
vote appeared to rest in the hands of one Democratic senator, who was
refusing to say which way he would vote.
Consequently, equity investors were reluctant to commit funds to the markets
while the budget's future was still in the balance.
Analysts feared that if the budget fell at the last hurdle, bond prices
would drop sharply when the markets reopen on Monday, and stock prices would
quickly follow suit.
Even some rare bullish economic news failed to spur much buying. The July
employment report showed a 162,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, and a
bigger-than-expected decline in the national unemployment rate from 7 per
cent to 6.8 per cent.
The big story was Eastman Kodak, which jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 58
5/8 in volume of 5.4m shares after the company announced its chairman, Mr
Kay Whitemore, was stepping down. Investors hope that the change at the top
of Kodak will trigger a revival in the company's fortunes.
Other Dow stocks were in mixed form. IBM fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 43 1/4
, Philip Morris rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 , and International
Paper climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 66.
Car stocks, which have been much in demand since the Big Three manufacturers
announced big improvements in second quarter earnings, ran into
profit-taking. General Motors fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 3/4, Chrysler
slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 42, and Ford dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 51
5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, the big technology issues were mixed. Apple fell
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 29 1/4 and Microsoft Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 73 1/4
, while Intel rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed higher in quiet trading. The composite index was
up 12.38 points to 3959.96, for a loss on the week of about 7 points.
Advancing issues led declines 386 to 302. Volume of 43.597 was below
Thursday's 53.077 and trading value declined to CDollars 441.9m from
CDollars 576m.

FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Corporate Germany confident worst is
over - Are hopes riding too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ignoring mutterings, mainly from beyond Germany's borders, of the threat to
industrial competitiveness posed by the effective removal of the European
exchange rate mechanism's corset last weekend, the markets have continued
their modest but determined upswing.
Not even a post-war high in western Germany's July unemployment figures,
reported yesterday, could deter traders. As far as the markets are
concerned, the general rise in the jobless is a further sign that industry
is seriously getting to grips with its structural problems. The DAX index
closed yesterday up 8.68 at 1,869.38.
On Thursday, for example, news of a further 3,000 job losses looming at
Volkswagen was seen as a sign of determined management and credited with
some of the DM12.50 rise in the shares after an extended twitchy spell due
mainly to the so-called 'Lopez Effect'. Yesterday the shares were unchanged
at DM374.
Markets have also been encouraged by a detectable increase in business
confidence. In spite of an unexpected 1.5 per cent drop in incoming
industrial orders in June - a figure affected by a dip in capital goods
demand which concealed progress elsewhere - the Bundesbank and government
appear to have convinced corporate Germany that the worst is past.
Cyclical stocks, especially chemicals, have been among the chief gainers.
Apart from the boost given by hopes of an end to recession, chemical sector
shares have also been helped by rapid implementation of restructuring.
Schering which this week reported a stout half-way performance, is well
ahead in transforming itself into a pure pharmaceuticals company, by
off-loading its agrochemicals divisions into a Hoechst-controlled joint
venture.
Its shares closed yesterday up DM18.30 at DM888.80.
While the mood is not exactly euphoric, the markets reflect the widespread
belief within Germany that when the international upswing comes, industry
will be best placed to take advantage of increased demand, particularly for
capital goods.
While other European economies have seen industrial bases eroded by
recession-induced disinvestment, German industry is packed with plant
installed in the post-unification rush.
Even so, as Mr Gunther Merl, head of the publicly-owned Landesbank
Hessen-Thuringen (Helaba), warned this week: the trees are not likely to
grow all the way to heaven in the foreseeable future.
Hopes of recovery still have to be realised, he warned. While the DAX index
seems to be heading steadily towards 1,900, he believes a dip to around
1,750 is still possible. At best, he forecasts sideways movements in the
coming weeks. The 'air is getting thin' he says, noting that large
institutional investors are currently operating more on the sell side, while
private investors are still buying.
Some are even more pessimistic. Among others, Mr Martin Hufner, chief
economist of the Bayersiche Vereinsbank, warns of a possible 'double-dip'
recession. While the Bundesbank has shown itself to be pleased by the
government's commitment to slashing federal spending by around DM25bn next
year, the cautious observers point out that this sum, amounting to almost 2
per cent of gross domestic product, is to come mainly out of unemployment
and other welfare benefits. In effect, it spells a looming potential cut in
domestic consumer demand of around this order, which is bound to have a
detectable impact on company prospects.
Frankfurt analysts suggest that the present index levels reflect
expectations of profits to come in 1994 and 1995 rather than any actual
developments. To justify current prices, the pessimists say, earnings will
have to grow by 45 per cent.
Closer to hand remains the persistent, if still unrealised, expectation that
France will reduce its short-term interest rates by at least two points and
that the franc will depreciate against the D-Mark by at least 5 per cent.
France buys around 17 per cent of German exports. While there will be
corporate gains to be made on incoming trade, outgoing business seems bound
to suffer. The engineering and car sectors, equal first export earners, both
rely on France for more than 10 per cent of their annual sales.
Markets also have to reckon with the prospects of domestic rate cuts,
although the Bundesbank's recent performance does not provide much ground
for optimism. Although long-term rates, at which most of industry does its
borrowing, are close to record real lows of about 2 per cent, the central
bank is still reluctant to loosen the reins too soon.
Once again, the government, which is now the main driving force in credit
markets at present and is mainly responsible for above-target monetary
growth, has yet to deliver the promised spending cuts.
The last thing to be expected from the incoming leadership at the bank is a
reversal of existing policy. Mr Hans Tietmeyer replaces retiring president
Mr Helmut Schlesinger in September, with a hard-headed monetarist Mr
Hans-Wilhelm Gaddum as number two. Neither of them has a reputation as a
soft touch.

FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei discouraged by
political haggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED haggling by the Liberal Democratic Party to stall the naming of
the new prime minister discouraged investors, and the Nikkei average lost
further ground on index-linked selling by investment trusts, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The leading 225-issue index fell 67.70 to 20,357.94 after a day's high of
20,379.74 and a low of 20,244.82, barely changed on the week.
The yen's rise to a record Y103 level against the dollar in overseas
markets, also kept investors away.
Volume totaled 200m shares against 238m. Arbitrageurs were seen placing
small lot buy orders. Declines led advances by 611 to 307, with 224 issues
remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.23
to 1,654.59 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 67.7 to close at
20357.94.
Traders said that overseas investors remained buyers of financial stocks,
especially trust banks, which are considered to be laggards among bank
issues. 'The stocks are fundamentally risky, and we expect a shift away from
the stocks in about a month,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson
International.
Mitsui Trust and Banking rose Y20 to Y1,260 and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
advanced Y10 to Y1,420. However, investors took profits on most commercial
banks. Bank of Tokyo fell Y30 to Y1,800 and Industrial Bank of Japan lost
Y70 to Y3,400.
Exporters were weak on the rise in the yen. Matsushita Electric Industrial
lost Y10 to Y1,350, Sony fell Y30 to Y4,420 and Toyota Motor fell Y10 to
Y1,660.
An overnight fall in gold prices on overseas markets prompted a fall in
mining stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y40 to Y1,010 and Mitsui Mining
and Smelting lost Y20 to Y532.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 74.85 to 22,295.10 in volume of 25.8m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets went their own ways yesterday.
HONG KONG continued to derive benefit from the better-than-expected results
from HSBC's Midland Bank with domestic and foreign demand driving the market
higher. The Hang Seng index ended 89.23 or 1.2 per cent higher at 7,396.77,
for a 5.8 per cent rise on the week.
Cheung Kong climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 27.80 and its afilliate
Hutchison Whampoa was up 40 cents to HKDollars 22.00. Jardine Matheson was
up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 59.50.
But most active HSBC Holdings came under pressure from profit-taking after
its 5 per cent surge on Thursday. It ended 50 cents down at HKDollars 79.50,
but its Hang Seng Bank unit climbed HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 61.50.
NEW ZEALAND saw a rise in Telecom mask an otherwise corrective day and the
NZSE-40 capital index reversed an early 13.4 point fall to end 2.13 higher
at 1,895.99, up 4.4 per cent on the week and another three year high.
Telecom, 8 cents ahead at NZDollars 4.00, is seen as a major beneficiary
from a tax reduction to foreign portfolio investors, announced earlier this
week.
BANGKOK was broadly higher in an extended bull run that surprised many
analysts. The SET index advanced 10.58 to a five-month high of 958.84 in
heavy turnover of Bt8.93bn. Property, media and electrical issues led the
rally which has lifted the index by 7.7 percent over the past eight
sessions.
SINGAPORE was lifted by some late buying ahead of the long holiday weekend,
and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 9.62 to 1,871.25, for a 3.5 per
cent rise on the week.
SYDNEY was hard hit early in the session by the gold price slump which left
the All Ordinaries index 36 points lower initially.
However, shares subsequently clawed back some of the losses and the index
ended down 23.1 at 1,842.2, little changed on the week.
Selling was on low volumes and mainly by smaller investors. Gold stocks
recovered slightly from early selling, but still finished down 188.1 or 8.11
per cent at 2,131.4.
Poseidon Gold shed 35 cents to ADollars 4.45, Placer Pacific 28 cents at
ADollars 3.00, Homestake 26 cents to ADollars 2.02 and Newcrest 42 cents to
ADollars 4.18.
TAIWAN finished lower, as late profit-taking erased early gains. The
weighted index, which gained more than 20 points in early trade, ended down
29.59 at 4,025.93, 0.8 per cent up on the week.
Cement stocks, which had recently lagged the market, were the only gainers.
Taiwan Cement rose 50 cents to TDollars 51.5.
MANILA gave up some of its recent gains in response to the lower bullion
price and the composite index dropped 16.95 at 1,743.97, a 0.4 per cent fall
on the week. Benguet, the country's biggest gold producer, eased 1.25 pesos
to 17 pesos.
SEOUL was sharply lower as large-capitalisation shares shed early gains and
individual investors remained in the sidelines. The composite index dipped
10.57 to 721.48, a 1.2 per cent fall on the week.
BOMBAY finished higher in spite of heavy selling pressure by domestic
financial institutions late in a session cut to 90 minutes to enable brokers
to settle unmatched trades. The BSE index closed 53.19 higher at 2,375.90.

FT  07 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris ends at all-time high on
rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of lower interest rates drove continental bourses higher
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS closed at a new all time high as investors took the view that a cut in
interest rates was imminent after the Bank of France reopened the five to 10
day lending facility that had been suspended on July 22 when speculation
against the franc began to intensify.
The CAC-40 index ended 34.53 higher at 2,149.83, a day's rise of 1.6 per
cent and a week's of 3 per cent. Turnover remained heavy at FFr5.2bn.
Cyclicals and financial sector stocks were strong with the finance sub-index
gaining 1.4 per cent. Peugeot added FFr14 to FFr680 and Michelin FFr8.60 to
FFr188.20.
AMSTERDAM ended the week in strong form, up 0.3 in the CBS Tendency index at
123.4, a gain of 1.1 per cent on the week.
There was a further decline in Elsevier, down Fl 2.80 at Fl 132.90 as
investors took another look at Thursday's results.
Hoogovens was very strong ahead of next week's results, putting on Fl 3.30
or 7.7 per cent to Fl 46.20. Hoare Govett forecasts a net loss of Fl 210m
for the half year period and notes that while expectations of a return to
profit makes the stock attractive on a long-term view, 'we would hold off
from buying in the wake of the recent run in the price'.
MILAN resumed its advance, the telecommunications sector once again
providing the lead, and the Comit index rose 1.01 to 581.48 for a 3.2 per
cent rise on the week.
Sip, the day's most active issue in volume of 23.3m shares, rose L188 or 6
per cent to L3,331 while Stet firmed L92 to L4,154 in volume of 15.3m
shares.
The renewed enthusiasm followed approval of the sector's reform by postal
minister Maurizio Pagani that will eventually lead to a single
telecommunications group.
Olivetti also posted solid gains, rising L54 to L1,876 with 11.2m shares
dealt. Kleinwort Benson, which recommended the stock this week, said it
regarded Olivetti as the most attractive of the big blue chip industrials at
present, not least because the shares had underperformed by 30 per cent over
the last year, in spite of the recent rally.
ZURICH saw some profit-taking that left the SMI index 0.8 lower at 2,423.5,
1.0 per cent up on a week that has seen the index at its all-time high.
Swissair, whose shares were under pressure on Thursday, shed SFr35 or 4.9
per cent to SFr715. The airline's announcement of a first half net loss of
SFr125m, compared with last year's SFr116m, was worse than analysts had been
expecting.
Nestle edged SFr1 above Thursday's low for the year to SFr1,018 although
analysts commented that the share continued under pressure.
STOCKHOLM saw turnover rise to a record SKr3.9bn as Sydkraft, the
electricity producer, divested itself of its entire shareholding in AGA, the
industrial gas group, accounting for SKr1.5bn of the total.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 8.60 to 1,250.10, up 4 per cent on the
week.
AGA B shares closed up SKr18 at SKr388 Sydkraft A shares added SKr6 to
SKr146.
OSLO closed at a new 1993 high, the index gaining 9.8 to 546.50, while
HELSINKI's Hex index put on 1.5 per cent to 1,252.3.
BRUSSELS saw renewed demand for steel shares which helped the Bel-20 index
19.18 or 1.5 per cent higher to 1,342.69 for a 1.2 per cent rise on the
week.
Cockerill Sambre added BFr5 or 3.9 per cent to BFr133 while Arbed rose
BFr390 or 10.4 per cent at BFr4,135.
MADRID was helped by the closing of Banesto's rights issue, and the general
index rose 1.18 at 271.37, 0.5 per cent higher on the week.
The results of Banesto's one-for-three offer, the first part of a Dollars
1.2bn capital increase, will be announced next week. The shares were steady
at Pta2,250.
VIENNA moved forward to a new, 14-month high with the ATX index 7.6 ahead at
989.2, up 4.3 per cent on the week.

FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES markets basked in the glory of the underlying FT-SE 100
index which hit a record closing high yesterday and Footsie futures
continued to attract buyers.
The futures contract for September delivery was not heavily traded but found
buyers at every level and broke through several support bands.
Surprisingly, there was very little fundamental backing to the market and
dealers attributed yesterday's strength to an 'excess of cash in the City'
as investors moved funds from low yielding bank accounts.
The only excuse to buy appeared to be the French decision to end its
emergency high lending facility and return to its existing 5-10 day cent
intervention rate which set the floor for French rates.
September futures opened at 2,960 and gained throughout the day to close
around 2,985, a premium of 12 to the cash market. Traded options saw just
over 38,000 contracts dealt with BT the most active stock option on turnover
of 2,348 lots.

FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hickson tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speciality chemicals group Hickson International fell sharply after the news
of an explosion at one of its plants, was joined by an analyst's sell
recommendation and confirmation that a leading institutional shareholder had
reduced its equity stake.
The shares were weakened initially by news of the explosion which had
destroyed one of Hickson's fine chemicals manufacturing plants at
Ringaskiddy, in the Irish Republic.
The explosion follows a fire last September at the company's plant in
Castleford Yorkshire which killed five staff. The fire led to a Pounds
250,000 fine and Pounds 150,000 costs a month ago.
After yesterday's news, Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst with Hoare
Govett, turned seller of the stock.
He said the explosion would hit investor confidence in the management and
would lead to uncertainty over future production.
He also said that a prospective p/e of 17 times was too high in the light of
the troubles and a sector rating of 15 times earning and argued that the
shares deserved to fall a further 10 per cent.
Finally, Hickson confirmed yesterday that Gartmore, one of its leading
shareholders, had sold 4.9m shares earlier in the week and taken its stake
down to 2.2 per cent.
Hickson's share price tumbled 14 to 194p with 1.1m shares changing hands.
The announcement by Thorn EMI that negotiations to sell its defence
electronics buisness to GEC had been called off hit both companies' shares.
Leisure analysts said that the fall in Thorn's price - down 10 at 935p -
reflected not only the market's immediate disappointment but also the fact
that no other suitor could be called to mind immediately. GEC shares slipped
a penny to 343 1/2 p.
The two companies admitted last month that they were in discussions, with a
price tag of Pounds 160m mentioned by industry specialists.
Standard Chartered gained 25 to 885p ahead of interim figures on Thursday as
buying pressure was accentuated by a bear squeeze.
Reed International slid a further 8 to 652p, apparently affected by the
caution of Dutch investors in Reed Elsevier over current trading conditions
and future prospects for the combined group.
Ms Chris Munro, media analyst at Hoare Govett, believes that the encouraging
interim figures, together with the group's exposure to advertising and
prospects of success in the Official Airline Guides deal will reassure both
Dutch and British investors.
Reuters Holdings again rose on enthusiastic US buying and strong UK
recommendations in a thin market. The shares closed 20 firmer at 1535p.
SG Warburg reiterated its buy recommendation for Carlton Communications on
an earnings growth forecast of 25 per cent. The shares appreciated 11 to
764p.
In the media agencies sector, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi went up 4 to 174 on a market
forecast that Tuesday will bring news of interim profits of around Pounds
9m.
A downgrade in United Biscuits undermined the shares which slid 8 to 381p.
Hoare Govett chopped its profit forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 198m,
blaming low food price inflation.
Board changes and fresh investment at Amber Day lifted the shares 7 to 71p.
An unfulfilled order was said to be holding Dixons up, the shares finishing
9 ahead at 236p. Sears, said to be benefiting from a Smith New Court
upgrade, was up 5 at 109p.
Glaxo failed to benefit from yesterday's rally after Nomura reiterated its
'sell' recommendation because of the potential downside of the forthcoming
Zantac patent case.
The shares closed unchanged at 529p.

FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Increased activity in Tesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET tussle over Tesco gained momentum yesterday as Goldman Sachs and
UBS added their weight to the view that the stock has been oversold and that
the company's latest marketing strategy marks a welcome initiative in an
intensely competitive sector. However, the many bears of the sector were
still out in force and the stock slipped after an initial strong surge,
ending the session 5 ahead at 214p. Turnover was a hefty 7.8m shares.
Tesco's 'Value' line strategy, a new line of own-label brands, was launched
this week and has raised some fears of a new price war as other retailers
react to any further squeeze on margins.
Goldman's Mr Philip Dorgan dismissed any notion of a new price war. 'No
company will start a price war because no one can win,' he said. He added
that Tesco was at a discount to the market of over 30 per cent and that any
downside was limited whereas the potential upside was susbtantial.
UBS, the house broker, was also reiterating its positive stance on the stock
yesterday. Credit Lyonnais Laing had set the ball rolling on Thursday.
Analysts said that they hoped the new Tesco initiative marked fresh thinking
by the management which some in the market have criticised for being
uninspired.
Meanwhile, BZW was continuing to underline its caution towards the entire
food retailing sector, advising clients to stay 'underweight'. While
welcoming the Tesco strategy to reposition itself in the market, the broker
warned that a response from its competitors, in particular Argyll and J
Sainsbury, could not be ruled out. Argyll shares were a half-penny better at
329p and Sainsbury slipped 2 to 471p.

FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index closes at new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 Share Index reached a new all-time closing high last night,
having earlier come within a few points of its intra-day peak. Optimism on
interest prospects in the UK and across the range of countries in the ERM
was buttressed by strength in UK government bonds and by demand for stock
index futures. Increased activity by UK private investors was reported, and
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index rose to yet another peak.
Buyers were in the majority from the opening of the market. Spurred on by
the future, the Footsie turned strongly ahead at mid-morning and by
mid-session showed a gain of 31 points at 2,974.4; but the market proved
unwilling to challenge the mid-March intra-day peak of 2,986.9, and share
gains were trimmed later.
At the final reading, the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 26.4 at 2,969.8,
comfortably exceeding the previous closing high of 2,957.3 achieved on March
8. Gains among second line stocks were equally widespread, the FT-SE Mid 250
Index gaining 30.5 to 3,392.8.
Seaq volume rose to 681.3m shares from Thursday's 616.4m which was worth
Pounds 1.41bn in customer business value. Business in non-Footsie stocks,
finally around 59 per cent of the total, increased strongly towards the
close.
The continued strength of the Footsie Mid 250 Index, together with the
turnover in non-Footsie stocks indicated UK private investor activity.
Sharelink, the execution-only stockbroker which came to the market a week
ago, said it had seen more transactions this week than in the whole of
August last year.
Some equity strategists warned yesterday that interest rate cuts by ERM
members should not be taken for granted. Mr Ian McCafferty of NatWest
Securities suggested that ERM members 'have not abandoned currency stability
as a policy aim,' and will conduct policies accordingly.
But such warnings fell on deaf ears yesterday afternoon when it was clear
that investors were gearing themselves up for a strong start on Monday
morning to the second leg of the UK equity trading account. This week has
brought gains of around 1.5 per cent in the Footsie stocks and about 2.6 per
cent in the Mid 250 listed issues.
Long-dated government bonds gained just over one point but the near dates
showed little change. The issue of Pounds 1.5bn tranches of existing bonds
was announced.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark marches upward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark made substantial gains yesterday against all the major European
currencies and the dollar, as currency markets continued to work through the
effects of last week's heavy central bank interventions, writes Stephanie
Flanders.
The mark gained nearly 2 pfennigs against sterling to close at DM2.5425,
down from Thursday's finish of DM2.5600, and against the dollar the German
currency rose over a pfennig to close at DM1.6975 compared to the previous
day's DM1.7165.
Other European currencies were similarly outmatched by the strength of the
D-Mark, in spite of the fact that the French, Danish and Belgian central
banks have yet to lower overnight lending rates from the crisis levels
reached during last week's currency turmoil.
Few doubted that the D-Mark's gains could be traced to the after-effects of
last week's central bank interventions. 'People can see that there are a lot
of D-Marks sloshing about,' said Julian Callow of Kleinwort Benson in
London. 'They are going to have to be drained, and that process is good for
the D-Mark.' Several traders suspected that ERM central banks whose
currencies were under pressure last week were now paying back they they owed
to the Bundesbank by selling sterling or dollars for marks.
The French franc lost 2.5 centimes on its opening level against the German
unit, closing at FFr3.495. Several traders believed that the Bank of
France's fragile foreign reserves position would put a downside on the
French unit for some time to come, even without a rapid fall in official
lending rates.
'If anything was surprising, it was the strength of the Franc earlier in the
week,' said Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London. 'It will
probably slip a bit more, given how much re-building there is going to have
to be of the Bank of France's reserves.'
Sterling finished the day a touch weaker against the dollar at Dollars
1.4980, from a previous close of Dollars 1.4910. The fact that there had
been very little change in the pound's relative position against the
American unit was further evidence that the weakening against the D-Mark had
been driven by conditions on the Continent. 'Sterling was just caught in the
cross-fire,' said Simon Callow.
The same pressures were taking the dollar lower against the D-Mark.
Otherwise, the markets had been little moved by the release of US non-farm
payroll data which showed a rise of 162,000 in July. Observers attributed
this to traders waiting to see the outcome of last night's Senate vote.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Rates stay up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France made a nod towards future monetary easing yesterday by
bringing back a key lending facility, but it refrained from lowering the
high cost of using it, writes Stephanie Flanders.
For some, the French authorities' decision to re-introduce its five to ten
day re-purchase rate, at a level of 10 per cent was an encouraging step
towards more normal monetary conditions in the Paris market after the
continued tightness of the past week. The rate was withdrawn to discourage
speculators at the height of the recent currency tensions, on July 22. 'The
French are halfway to normality', said one analyst, 'they've dipped their
toes in it.'
But others said that bringing back the window at the overnight emergency
rate which temporarily replaced was an official sign that significant
interest rate cuts were going to be slow in coming. 'When they withdrew the
the facility earlier in the year, it was reinstated at 7.75 per cent,' said
one London-based trader. 'The fact that they have kept it high is probably a
sign that they are only going to ease overnight rates gradually.'
At the end of Friday, the market appeared to have settled on the latter
view, at least for the weekend. September Franc futures closed at around
93.50, significantly below its morning peak of 122.08.
Elsewhere in European money markets, the Danish and Belgian authorities
continued to maintain the tight stance which theyhave stuck to ever since
the weekend's reforms of the exchange rate mechanism. Several in the market
commented that the rates could not be kept at such high levels very much
longer in either Belgium or Denmark. 'If anything, the French policy is more
sustainable,' said one analyst.
In London markets, trading was quiet compared to the activity of the
preceding two weeks. Another small shortage of Pounds 600m was easily dealt
with in early afternoon purchases by the Bank of England. The Bank also
announced that no six month bills would be offered until further notice.
'Overall, the London money markets have followed the French markets for much
of the week,' said one London-based analyst. 'In France the expectations of
interest rate cuts have also faded a little.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Net profit at Molson slips 4.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOLSON Companies reported a 4.3 per cent decline in net profit for the
first quarter of fiscal 1991, mainly due to its smaller stake in the brewing
affiliate.
But Diversey, the international special chemicals business, Malsham, the
hardware retailing group, and the sports and entertainment units all did
better.
Earnings for the June quarter were CDollars 36.8m (USDollars 28.5m), or 62
cents a share, against CDollars 38.4m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
were CDollars 772m, down 3.3 per cent.
Molson's interest in Molson Breweries is now 40 per cent, down from 50 per
cent, following its alliance earlier this year with Miller Brewing of the
US.
Molson and Foster's of Australia each own 40 per cent of Molson Breweries,
while Miller holds 20 per cent. Miller has the exclusive right to market
Molson brands in the US in return for a cash royalty. The alliance's aim is
to build the Molson name to 'mainstream' market share in the US.
'Molson's North American base can generate handsome rewards from this
alliance,' said Mr Marshall Cohen, Molson president. In addition, Diversey
was growing strongly in Europe and turning around in the US.
Malsham's new home-improvement superstores in eastern Canada were performing
above expectations, he added.
Total Canadian beer sales dipped 0.3 per cent in the latest quarter. Molson
Breweries' volume declined 2.6 per cent and its market share was 49 per
cent, against 50.6 per cent.
Molson's share of brewing operating profit was CDollars 37.4m, down almost
29 per cent, largely due to the lower ownership in Molson Breweries.
Diversey's sales advanced 5.2 per cent to CDollars 335m and operating profit
was up 12.5 per cent to CDollars 18m. Malsham sales dipped 3.2 per cent to
CDollars 246m because of store closures.

FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: BZ investment vehicle targets
gas industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE maverick BZ banking group of Zurich has launched a SFr500m (Dollars
330m) investment company, Gas Vision, to build up an influential portfolio
of shares in industrial gas companies.
Gas Vision made a dramatic start yesterday, paying SFr330m for an 11.8 per
cent voting stake in Aga, making it the second-largest shareholder in the
Swedish industrial gas group.
Separately, Sydkraft, the Swedish power concern, said it was selling its
entire shareholding in Aga in a move which would net some SKr1.6bn (Dollars
199m) at current market prices.
Sydkraft bought its stake in December 1988 and said it had always intended
to sell the holding within three to five years.
Like BZ's two existing operations, BK Vision and Pharma Vision, the new
investment company can be expected actively to assert its rights as a
shareholder.
'We want to be a major shareholder of very few companies and we hope to add
value by asking questions and maybe even making suggestions,' said Mr Martin
Ebner, BZ president.
He said Gas Vision would not only take stakes in the big international gases
groups, such as BOC of the UK and L'Air Liquide of France, but would
approach small family-owned companies with a view to floating them or
exchanging their shares for Gas Vision shares.
BK Vision, which has a portfolio of shares of financial companies, attracted
attention in June by initiating a court challenge to a Union Bank of
Switzerland decision that could be used to waive shareholder rights. BK is
the largest single shareholder in UBS, with a 15 per cent stake.
Gas Vision represents a significant diversification for the BZ group, which
has previously concentrated its research and dealing expertise exclusively
on Swiss equities.
Mr Ebner said Mr Jacques Imler, president of Carba, the Swiss gases company,
would bring inside industry knowledge to Gas Vision.

FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Nissan forced into further cut
in capital expenditure

NISSAN, Japan's second-largest carmaker, is cutting capital investment
further this year as its attempt to emerge from losses is hindered by weak
domestic demand and the appreciation of the yen.
The group aims to reduce capital outlays by some Y20bn more than planned,
bringing the total for the year to next March to around Y150bn (Dollars
1.44bn) - down by a quarter from the Y199bn in the 1992 financial year.
Capital spending for 1994 and 1995 would be held at this year's level.
A streamlining plan announced in February had envisaged a Y170bn capital
budget for the year, but that was based on an assumed Y112.5 average
exchange rate to the dollar. The rate is now nudging Y104, and Nissan says
it suffers Y11bn in exchange losses for every Y1 by which the yen
strengthens against the US currency.
Last year Nissan slid into losses of Y26.25bn before tax (Y15.05bn net), its
first deficit since just after the second world war. When it announced the
loss in May, the company said it aimed to break even this time both at
pre-tax and net level.
Yesterday the company said it 'strongly hoped' to achieve that forecast, but
cost-cutting had to be stepped up by about Y30bn, of which the extra capital
expenditure savings would form the biggest part.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president, said yesterday: 'We expected that vehicle
sales (in Japan) in the second half of 1993 would recover. But the yen's
appreciation against the dollar is likely to damage the economy and sales
during this period.'
Nissan is also squeezing margins further at its suppliers, and is placing
some hope in two new sports models for the domestic market. Sales of
securities holdings may boost the bottom line, but Nissan will have to draw
about Y17.6bn from reserves in order to make dividend payments.
Sumitomo Rubber Industries, the tyre and sporting goods maker which owns
Dunlop in Europe, reported interim profits down 14.2 per cent to Y4.13bn.
Sales were 5.7 per cent lower at Y116.3bn. For 1993 as a whole it projected
profits of Y10bn before tax, down 15.3 per cent. It aims to maintain a Y9
dividend, of which Y4 is being paid now.

SHARES in Astra, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals group, rose 4 per cent in
early trading yesterday on news that its licensing agreement with Merck, the
world's largest prescription drug company, is set to become a full-scale
joint venture.
Merck's US sales of three Astra products passed Dollars 500m in the year to
July, setting in motion the creation of the new venture under an agreement
dating from 1982.
Astra must decide by early 1995 whether to take a 50 per cent stake in the
business. If it does - as seems likely - it will have to pay Merck an amount
equal to its US licence sales in the year from September 1 1993, which given
the fast growth of the business, could be as much as Dollars 700m.
Until then, Merck would continue to own Astra/Merck, which is based in
Wayne, Pennsylvania, although it would be run as a separate entity.
Astra's shares rose 4.4 per cent to SKr165 early yesterday, although they
ended the day unchanged at SKr158.
Astra products marketed by Merck are the anti-peptic ulcer agent Losec
(under its US name Prilosec), and two heart drugs, Plendil and Tonocard.
Merck has also filed a new drug application for Roxiam, a new
Astra-developed therapy for schizophrenia.
By taking a half stake in the venture, Astra would get 50 per cent of the
profits from the US sales of these drugs, rather than a royalty on sales as
at present.
At the same time, the collaboration with Merck could deepen, with additional
drugs being brought into the venture, as Merck would gain the right to most
pharmaceutical discoveries from Astra's research in the future. However, the
agreement would remain restricted to the US market.
Mr Roy Vagelos, Merck chairman and chief executive, said: 'It's a very
important step for Merck because it establishes an independent company and
therefore guarantees the flow of research products from the Astra
laboratories.'
Losec, in particular has proved a great success for Astra. Total sales of
the drug (including those through licensees) soared 70 per cent in the first
three months of 1993 to reach SKr2.64bn (Dollars 328.8m).

GENERAL MOTORS is on track to achieve a Dollars 4bn reduction in its annual
North American parts purchasing costs by the end of 1993, compared with the
level of early 1991, Mr Richard Wagoner, GM executive vice-president, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Traverse City, Michigan.
The Dollars 4bn total combines a Dollars 2bn cost-reduction target set when
GM reorganised its purchasing operations in mid-1992 under former purchasing
chief Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua - now at the centre of an
industrial spying row between GM and Volkswagen - with an earlier effort
that started in 1991, said Mr Wagoner, who heads GM's global purchasing and
also serves as chief financial officer.
GM was still using the same basic purchasing system that Mr Lopez
implemented, but it was trying to co-operate more closely with suppliers on
issues such as protecting their proprietary information from competitors.
Mr Wagoner said that the purchasing operation 'has been running just as good
in the past three to four months as it was before', when Mr Lopez was in
charge of GM's purchasing.
Mr Lopez left GM for Volkswagen in March this year.
GM spends about Dollars 35bn annually on parts and components in North
America, and Dollars 50bn worldwide.
Under the purchasing system implemented a year ago, Mr Lopez opened all of
GM's North American parts contracts to new bids. However, Mr Wagoner said
that more than 80 per cent of GM's purchased parts were still supplied by
the same vendors.
GM's worldwide purchasing programme must be 'tough but fair,' he said.
Mr Wagoner explained that components suppliers now dealt with one
organisation in the US, rather than with 27 purchasing organisations as
previously.
Mr Gerald Collins, director of GM's new North American vehicle launch
centre, added that the company wanted to reduce its new product development
time - including time in the launch centre - to about 35 months from about
44 months currently.

SHOWA SHELL Sekiyu, the Royal Dutch/Shell group's Japanese affiliate which
in February revealed its traders had run up some Dollars 1bn in unrealised
foreign exchange losses, said yesterday its efforts to resolve the debacle
were yielding better than expected results.
The unauthorised dealings at the oil refiner and distributor, half-owned by
the Anglo-Dutch group, led to provisions being made in its parent's accounts
and to the resignation of Showa Shell's chairman and president.
A Dollars 6.44bn forward exposure to the dollar at the end of last year -
incurred in secret by a group in Showa Shell's treasury, which had
erroneously believed the US currency would rise against the yen - was
reduced by Dollars 2.97bn during the first half to June.
The settling of these contracts brought the unrealised losses down by
Y71.8bn, from Y165bn at the end of February.
Nearly a quarter of the dollars generated were used in the course of its
business - buying crude and other products, and repaying foreign borrowings
 -with the Y53.9bn remainder charged as a special loss.
The company sold securities and land holdings which, because of a favourable
turn in the stock market, should bring Y15bn more profit than projected, for
a total of Y65bn this year.
Some Y100bn of the unrealised exchange losses are to be realised for 1993.
It was thought that only Y70bn could be settled this year.
Showa Shell described the progress as encouraging, but said there was a
'longish tunnel' of two to three years before it would emerge from the
episode.
The company yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits down 2.1 per cent to
Y18.27bn (Dollars 175.25m), but net earnings 52.6 per cent lower at Y5.12bn
after the exceptional charges. Sales dipped 2.1 per cent to Y746.1bn, with
import prices cheaper but volumes flat.

FT  07 AUG 93 / International Company News: Whitmore resigns as Kodak chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT directors of Eastman Kodak, the troubled photographic equipment
company, have forced the resignation of Mr Kay Whitmore, its embattled
chairman, president and chief executive.
The move comes after weeks of turmoil at the Rochester, New York-based group
 -beginning with the resignation of Mr Christopher Steffen, Kodak's chief
financial officer, in April, and leading up to an uneasy meeting with
institutional shareholders last month.
At the heart of the debate is the question of how Kodak should restructure
to improve its performance and counter the threat from 'own brand' film
manufacturers. Critics of Mr Whitmore have claimed he was moving too
cautiously in addressing these issues.
But the resignation also emphasises the more active role being taken in the
US by independent board directors and some of the largest institutional
shareholders, and mimics similar top-level management changes forced
recently at General Motors and International Business Machines.
Kodak's independent directors - who include Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman of
Coca-Cola, Mr John Phelan, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange,
and Mr Richard Zimmerman, head of Hershey - said they had decided to call in
a executive search firm to find a replacement for Mr Whitmore. 'This action
. . . is a logical extension of our previous commitment . . . to ensure that
the performance of the company is significantly improved,' the statement
said bluntly.
Mr Whitmore, who has been at Kodak for 35 years, will remain as chairman
while the search goes ahead. But Kodak said it would not now unveil its
'turnaround' plan - which Mr Whitmore had promised to deliver in September -
on schedule.
'Over the next several months, enhanced plans for cash flow generation and
debt reduction will be executed and continuing work will go forwards at an
accelerated pace on efforts to reduce costs,' said the directors. But they
added the 'complete plan' would need input from Mr Whitmore's successor.
Instead, Mr Whitmore will write to shareholders and employees, 'commenting
on current progress', after a board meeting on August 13.
Most analysts assumed the directors' action means the company will move much
more decisively to address its problems, and that redundancies and asset
sales could be on the way.
In addition to replacing Mr Whitmore, Kodak still needs a new finance
director, a post which has been vacant since the departure of Mr Steffen
after only 11 weeks in the job.
That departure, which came shortly before Kodak's annual meeting, was the
catalyst for the current turmoil.
It quickly became apparent that Mr Steffen - who has since joined Citicorp -
wanted to revive Kodak's fortunes by large-scale lay-offs, cuts in corporate
spending and by shedding a large non-core business.
In April, Mr Whitmore said he and Mr Steffen could not agree on 'the process
for making . . . change happen', although the chairman later added he was
'stunned' by Mr Steffen's departure.
Mr Whitmore subsequently survived the difficult annual meeting, and seemed
to regain some confidence from investors when he announced last month that
Kodak would spin off its large Eastman Chemical unit.
However, some analysts and investors have questioned whether the
'turnaround' plan would go far enough.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold returns to earth
with a bump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market came down to earth with a resounding bump late this week
after the speculative balloon that had hoisted the price of the yellow metal
to a post-Gulf War high was punctured by reports of Chinese central bank
selling.
The bulls were still feeding off the foreign exchange turmoil caused by the
crisis threatening the European Community's exchange rate mechanism as they
pushed the gold price, which had risen by Dollars 15.25 last week, up
another Dollars 4 to Dollars 409.75 a troy ounce on Monday morning. The
market's buoyancy quickly began to fail however, in that rarified atmosphere
and by the end of the day the price was back to Dollars 403.25 an ounce.
Subsequent attempts to reinflate the bullish mood failed in the face of lack
of support from the New York investment funds and the emphasis switched to
consolidation of the earlier break through the Dollars 400-an-ounce barrier.
Even that limited ambition had to be abandoned on Thursday, however, when
the reported bank of China sale of 193,000 ounces of gold gave the signal
for a general sell-off, with Arab and Swiss syndicates in the forefront.
Retreat turned into rout as speculators piled on the selling pressure and
the London price closed at Dollars 388.25 an ounce, down Dollars 13.25 on
the day. The fall continued in after-hours trading, taking the price to
Dollars 372, and traders were beginning to consider the technical
consequences of a breach of the Dollars 360 support level. Such fears proved
misplaced, or perhaps only premature, and by yesterday's morning fixing at
the London bullion price had steadied to Dollars 381.90 an ounce. But
renewed selling took the price to Dollars 376.50 an ounce at the close and
the mood remained nervous as traders looked over their shoulders at the
heavy investment fund long positions that were still overhanging the market.
Analysts were not unanimously gloomy, however. Some suggested Thursday's
fall was no more than a healthy correction after a speedy price rise. If
gold could climb back to Dollars 395, the bull market would remain intact,
they added.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles
Lambert, said: 'Gold had an Dollars 85 move upwards so a Dollars 25
correction is nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.' If the price
held above Dollars 380 for another 24 hours, she suggested, 'the funds will
be more likely to take it up than down'.
The platinum market had maintained its steady appearance, helped by news
that labour talks at South Africa's Impala mine were going to to mediation,
until it was sucked into the abyss left by gold's plunge. Thursday's Dollars
17.25 fall wiped out the earlier Dollars 5.40 advance and yesterday's
afternoon fix of Dollars 387.75 an ounce was Dollars 25.85 down from a week
earlier.
Silver also suffered, the London spot price ending at 457.50 cents an ounce,
down 80 cents on the week.
In strong contrast to the precious metals, the London Commodity Exchange
coffee market took on an altogether more healthy complexion this week.
Rises in the preceding fortnight had been based largely on growing belief in
the Latin American producers' ability to make their scheme to retain 20 per
cent of scheduled exports bear fruit in the form of an improved
supply/demand balance. That factor continued to underpin sentiment this
week, but the main reason for a much more constructive performance was a
growing fear of significant frost damage being buffered by coffee crops in
the south of Brazil, the biggest producer.
After traders heard on Wednesday that a powerful polar air mass was moving
towards the coffee growing states of Parana and Sao Paulo the September
delivery futures price climbed to a 2 1/2 -year high of Dollars 1,138 a
tonne. And technical factors took over the next day, pushing the price to
Dollars 1,180 a tonne at one stage.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, a London trading house, explained that
the earlier rise had pushed a growing number of options 'into the money'
forcing granters to make covering futures purchases at an accelerating rate.
In so doing they were, of course, lifting the price still further and
obliging themselves to take still more cover.
That vicious circle appeared to have been broken yesterday, however, when
the price backtracked by Dollars 43 to Dollars 1,114 a tonne, up Dollars 76
on the week. But traders thought further heavy retrenchment was unlikely in
view of the continuing risk of frost in Brazil.
At the London Metal Exchange technical factors were dominant, with the
threat of a supply squeeze still gripping the copper market and a 'chart
breakdown' driving zinc prices to six-year lows.
The tightness for late September delivery copper showed no sign of easing,
despite warnings by the exchange management last week that it was prepared
to take action to frustrate suspected manipulation, and the premium against
three months metal widened to Dollars 28 a tonne.
Meanwhile the three months zinc price plunged yesterday to Dollars 896.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 42 on the day and Dollars 44.75 on the week, as
yesterday's chart breakdown triggered heavy stop-loss selling and kept
buyers at bay.
Lead had been the strongest LME contract until it was undermined by the
slump in zinc. Three months metal climbed to Dollars 420 a tonne, encouraged
by Far East buying interest, before ending at Dollars 409.25 a tonne, up
Dollars 4.50.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Flogas members back offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of DCC said yesterday that the pre-condition regarding its partial
cash offer to raise its stake in Flogas, the publicly-quoted Irish
distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, had been satisfied.
The pre-condition was that independent shareholders accounting for at least
20.2 per cent of Flogas accepted the offer by 3pm yesterday.
The news prompted a 48p rise in Flogas shares to 288p.
On Thursday DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company founded
and run by Mr Jim Flavin, bid 325p a share to lift its 29.9 per cent holding

It was reported yesterday that Powerimpact, the DCC subsidiary bidding for
up to 7.37m Flogas shares, had received irrevocable commitments to accept
the partial offer in respect of 5.16m shares, representing 21.1 per cent of
the equity.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day chairman quits after board split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOARDROOM split at Amber Day has led to the departure of Mr Stacey Ellis
as chairman only seven months after he joined the discount retailer in an
attempt to rebuild its shattered credibility with the City.
Mr Ellis, a former director of Inchcape, the blue-chip business services
group, has resigned and will be replaced by Mr Peter Carr, an experienced
retailer who Mr Ellis recruited as a non-executive director in March.
Mr Carr becomes executive chairman of Amber Day and Mr David Thompson, the
group's finance director, will become chief executive of the company which
owns the Glasgow-based chain of 52 What Everyone Wants stores.
Mr Thompson denied any split, but other sources insisted that Mr Ellis's
departure comes after a bitter boardroom wrangle in which the chairman was
outmanoeuvred by Mr Carr.
Mr Carr is being backed by Warburg, Pincus, the US investment institution,
which yesterday acquired a 10 per cent stake in Amber Day from HSBC Holdings
in an off-market deal.
Warburg, Pincus will put a non-executive director on the board and may fund
more rapid expansion by the group.
Mr Thompson has been acting chief executive of Amber Day since the sudden
departure last September of Mr Philip Green, Amber Day's controversial
chairman and chief executive.
Mr Green stepped down with a Pounds 1.13m golden handshake after a deluge of
adverse press coverage was followed by results well below analysts'
expectations.
Mr Ellis will not be leaving his Pounds 75,000-a-year job empty-handed. He
bought 500,000 shares before joining the company, and was awarded 1m options
at 28p, which he will now be able to exercise.
Amber Day's shares yesterday closed 7p higher at 71p, so he stands to make
more than Pounds 600,000 from his shares alone.
Mr Ellis had wanted to give the post of chief executive to an external
candidate, but other board members favoured Mr Thompson.
Reports of a boardroom split appeared in the press last weekend. Mr Ellis
said on Sunday that the entire board supported the search for a chief
executive from outside the company and that Mr Thompson was not likely to be
a suitable candidate.
It was that statement which appears to have prompted Mr Ellis's departure.
Mr Thompson said last night there had been no boardroom split, just a
democratic decision.
Amber Day's shares collapsed from a peak of 129p at the end of 1991 to 23p
last August after a series of bear raids and newspaper stories about Mr
Green's business associates and commercial deals.
They recovered steadily after Mr Ellis arrived, peaking at 86p in April, but
fell back after Mr Green unloaded his 8 per cent stake for Pounds 7.6m later
in the same month.
Mr Carr, 52, until recently worked in Spain, where he was chief executive of
Galerias Preciados from 1988-91. Before that he spent 11 years with the
stores group Debenhams and was promoted to managing director.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hickson chemical plant damaged by explosion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON International, the speciality chemicals and timber treatment group,
was hit by its second disaster within 12 months yesterday when an explosion
badly damaged one of its fine chemicals manufacturing plants in the Irish
Republic.
The blast at the site in Ring-askiddy, County Cork, caused damaged estimated
initially at several million pounds.
The plant, one of two on the site, was used to make active and intermediate
ingredients for pharmaceutical companies throughout the world and is the
only one run by Hickson to have received approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration.
Mr Michael Rowley, group finance director, said: 'The plant has been badly
damaged and production will be disrupted for some months. However, we do
have inventories of the finished product and the damage and loss of business
is fully covered by insurance.
The explosion will be a further blow to investor confidence, which was
dented last autumn after a fire at another of the company's sites in
Castleford, West Yorkshire, killed five staff and landed Hickson with a
Pounds 250,000 fine and Pounds 150,000 costs.
Earlier this week one of the Gartmore stable of investment funds, which had
been a leading Hickson shareholder, placed 4.9m shares in the market and
reduced its stake to 2.2 per cent. Yesterday, Hickson's share price fell 14p
to 194p.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Lotus writes off Pounds 24m against defunct
Elan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP LOTUS, the sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy,
plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m in 1992 on a turnover of Pounds
60.98m.
General Motors of the US, which bought Lotus in 1986 for Pounds 22.7m, is
negotiating - most importantly with Bugatti Automobili of Italy - to sell
the company, following the breakdown of talks earlier this year with a Lotus
management buy-out team.
The group has been in loss for several years, but its financial plight
deteriorated sharply last year with the commercial failure of its new Lotus
Elan sports car, which has cost it a write-off of Pounds 24.4m, according to
its annual report.
Lotus ceased production of the Elan last summer after less than
two-and-a-half years, making it one of the shortest-lived new cars launched
on the world market in recent years.
According to Touche Ross, the auditors, there is fundamental uncertainty
over the future of the company, unless it can secure adequate refinancing
arrangements or continuing support from GM.
GM has already been forced to pump in Pounds 18m to repair the battered
balance sheet in 1991, including Pounds 11.5m in new equity. It has been
seeking to sell the company for more than a year.
The pre-tax loss compared with Pounds 14.7m a year earlier, while turnover
dropped 30 per cent to almost Pounds 61m (Pounds 87.5m). Net loss was Pounds
27.1m (Pounds 14.8m) after a Pounds 9.42m tax credit.
There were exceptional charges totalling Pounds 27.1m (income Pounds 1.23m)
comprising the Elan provision and a Pounds 2.73m write-off on the sale of
Millbrook Proving Ground, the management company for its Bedfordshire test
track.
GM has taken over the proving ground, one of the leading vehicle test tracks
in the UK. It is now held by General Motors Holdings (UK), the US group's
British holding company, which also owns Vauxhall.
Following the demise of the Elan Lotus has been forced to limit production
to just one model, the Esprit luxury sports car, of which it is planning to
build 350 this year. Car output fell to 688 last year including 495 Elans,
from 2,241 in 1991 of which 2,060 were Elans.
During the year the workforce was cut further from 1,602 to 1,154, with the
production and sales staff being reduced by 36 per cent to 664.
While the cars business has suffered heavy losses, the engineering
consultancy has remained in the black with a profit of Pounds 5.97m (Pounds
5.95m) last year on a turnover of Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 44.3m).
Group losses have grown rapidly in recent years from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to
Pounds 4.4m in 1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990 and Pounds 14.7m in 1991. Under
the impact of last year's heavy losses the net negative worth increased from
Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 32.4m by the end of 1992.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bunzl expands via Pounds 17m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNZL is expanding its paper and plastics business into the UK with the
planned acquisition of GKN's paper operations for Pounds 16.75m.
The acquisition is being funded by a placing of 13m shares at 129p. The
group's shares slipped a 1p to 133p .
Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said that while the amount was quite
small to raise from shareholders it was 'helpful rather than potentially
harmful to the balance sheet'. The group's debt of about Pounds 100m at the
year end represents gearing of 50 per cent.
Bunzl's biggest earner is its paper and plastics operations, which last year
increased operating profit from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 31.6m. The
acquisition of GKN's paper and plastics operations, called ACS, gives the
group a foothold in the UK industry which is estimated to be worth about
Pounds 500m. Mr Habgood said: 'It opens new horizons in a very big market.'
Bunzl's current paper and plastics operations have been restricted to the US
and Australia.
ACS's operating profit declined from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2.5m at the end of
last year.
Mr Habgood said: 'It is easy not to get all the love and attention needed to
flourish when a business is not regarded as core and has been up for sale
for some time.'
In spite of what he called a 'tough economic environment' Mr Habgood said
Bunzl had traded strongly during the year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NET ASSET value per share of Newmarket Venture Capital slipped 1p to 61p
over the six months ended June 30. The figure was the result of 'several
counter balancing factors.'
At June 30 1992 the value stood at 56p.
For the half year to end-June net losses were cut to Pounds 70,000 compared
with a previous deficit of Pounds 1.04m and losses per share were 0.2p
against 2.9p.
As already announced, the company is to be voluntarily wound up and the
assets distributed to shareholders following the 1994 annual meeting.
Net assets at June 30 stood at Pounds 21.71m. That compared with Pounds
19.98m a year earlier and with Pounds 22.24m at end-December 1992.

WHOLESALE Fittings, which distributes industrial and commercial electrical
products, finished the year ended April 30 with a drop of 19.5 per cent in
pre-tax profits.
However, the dividend is being maintained at 11.7p as the directors are
confident that recent and continuing actions will maintain the strong
financial base.
Market share had improved and sales for the opening quarter showed a volume
increase.
The 1992-93 profit was Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 2.51m) from sales of Pounds
62.4m (Pounds 62.2m). Strict control of costs necessitated a 7 per cent
reduction in staff as well as closure of the Telford branch.
Earnings per share were 9.83p (11.7p). The final dividend is again 8.47p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUNKELD, the shirt and swimwear manufacturer which recently returned to the
black after two refinancings, yesterday appeared back on the brink of
collapse as its shares were suspended at 28p pending clarification of its
financial position.
The group refused to comment. However, it is believed that Dunkeld is facing
a liquidity crisis. It is thought to have needed about Pounds 2m for working
capital purposes. It is believed that Hill Samuel, the group's lead bankers
and 30 per cent shareholder, were not prepared to meet the requirement.
In February, the group returned an annual pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.45m,
against a loss of Pounds 17.5m.
Dunkeld has debt of about Pounds 7m, the legacy of rapid expansion in the
1980s when borrowing rose to Pounds 16m.

PORTH Group, the USM-quoted maker of Christmas decorations, packaging and
framing products, announced slightly increased pre-tax losses of Pounds
1.89m for the half year to June 30. Losses last time were Pounds 1.84m.
Mr John Miller, chief executive, said the results reflected the seasonality
of the group's main subsidiary, Porth Decorative Products, where orders were
ahead of last year and savings were being made following the consolidation
of operations on one site.
At its Framemaker subsidiary sales had fallen, he said, but management had
been changed and policies reviewed. Goodmark, the aerosol products maker,
continued to improve, he said.
The directors, 'with a degree of caution', looked forward to a profitable
year.
Turnover fell from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 2.2m. Losses per share amounted to
9.8p (9.6p).

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Taking a gamble on the switch - The reverse
takeover of Crockfords by TV-am
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRECTORS of TV-am, the breakfast television company which lost its
licence, yesterday took a final gamble and bought Crockfords, the Mayfair
casino in a reverse takeover.
The deal will be paid for by a rights issue which will raise Pounds 50m and
give the company, to be known as Crockfords, a market capitalisation of
Pounds 90m.
Mr Richard Redmayne, a director of TV-am who will remain a non-executive
director of Crockfords, said yesterday: 'I think it is a very good deal
which offers TV-am shareholders a very real alternative.'
After losing its licence to Good Morning Television, TV-am was planning a
voluntary liquidation until it was approached by Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman
of Crockfords.
He was not only keen to get a Stock Exchange listing for his casino group
but also wanted to 'acquire' some of TV-am's institutional shareholders, who
range from Phillips &amp; Drew and Scottish Amicable to Schroders and Fidelity.
Under the conditional deal, TV-am will acquire all the issued share capital
of Crockfords in return for 71.25m ordinary shares in TV-am credited as
fully paid. These shares are worth Pounds 64.1m at the offer price of 90p.
Of the shares, 26.8m will go to the vendors and 44.3m will be offered as
part of the rights issue. The issue is on the basis of 9-for-2. Of the
Pounds 50m to be raised from the issue, Pounds 39.9m will go to the vendors
and the rest, together with about Pounds 9m of TV-am cash, will be used to
pay off remaining Crockfords debt.
Hambros Bank, which is sponsoring the deal, is also offering to buy up to 20
per cent of the existing ordinary TV-am shares to provide a cash alternative
of 18p.
Not all TV-am directors were happy with the Crockfords deal. Mr Stratos
Zagraphos, who was its finance director, resigned last month because he felt
he did not know enough about the casino business to carry out proper due
diligence.
Pro forma earnings per share of the enlarged group were 12.6p for the year
to December 1992 and 7p for the 24 weeks ending June 13 1993. The pro forma
earnings multiple at the offer price is 7.1 times.
Operating profits at Crockfords have ranged from Pounds 7.4m in 1990 to
Pounds 19.8m last year. The figure for the first half of this year is Pounds
11.4m.
The company warns, however, that in each of the last three financial years
Crockfords top 10 players have accounted for 5 per cent of profits although
the members of the 'exceptional players' list changed over the period.
'A small group of players can have a dramatic impact on the performance of
an up-market casino in any given period,' the Hambros statement said.
Last year, if the current proposals had been implemented, there would have
been a dividend of 5.2p.
Dealings in the shares are due to start on September 1.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals hit N'umbrian Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBRIAN FINE Foods, the snack food manufacturer which earlier this year
postponed interim results and suspended its shares, is raising Pounds
785,000 net through a rights issue to fund the marketing and operating costs
of launching a new biscuit.
The reorganised USM-quoted company also reported that, hit by non-recurring
charges, it had swung from profits of Pounds 154,645 to losses of Pounds
5.66m pre-tax for the year to March 31.
The 8-for-25 rights issue is of 11.57m new ordinary shares at 8p a share. It
is being underwritten by Wise Speke.
Northumbrian plans to spend Pounds 300,000 of the proceeds on a television
advertising campaign for its new Dunkers, shaped-for-dunking, biscuit.
Mr Henry Roberts, chief executive since June, said: 'This is not a survival
rights. We are raising new money for a business plan.'
Turnover last year rose to Pounds 21m (Pounds 15.9m), helped by the first
full-year contribution of its Biscuits for the Connoisseur distribution
business.
The group returned operating profits of Pounds 103,413 (Pounds 832,526) but
before a total of Pounds 4.69m (Pounds 450,000) in exceptional charges
mainly reflecting the loss on the disposal of lossmaking Lees of Scotland.
Net interest payable was Pounds 660,847 (Pounds 422,718), reflecting debt of
more than Pounds 6m (about Pounds 3m). Prior to the rights the group had
Pounds 4.6m in recently restructured debt giving gearing of 108 per cent.
This is set to fall to 80 per cent post-rights.
The board does not recommend a dividend and paid only a 0.75p interim in the
previous period. Losses per share emerged at 15.68p (earnings 0.97p).
Directors plan to propose the reduction of the share premium account at the
annual meeting.
Intangible assets unchanged at Pounds 2.9m are now worth 44 per cent of
total assets. The company said its high proportion of intangibles, valued at
directors' estimates of brands, reflected a decline in tangible assets to
Pounds 5.47m (Pounds 9.78m) mainly related to the disposal of Lees.
Northumbrian bought the quoted confectionery and chocolate maker for Pounds
4.8m in 1991. Negotiations for its sale, including debt of almost Pounds 3m,
had delayed the interims and caused the share suspension in February. The
consideration was Pounds 1.15m and the new owners have an option to buy the
Lees brand, one of the intangible assets, for Pounds 1m within four years.

FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI and GEC end defence sale talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI has failed in its bid to sell its defence electronics business to
GEC. The talks between the two companies, which had been progressing for
months, broke down earlier this week.
No reason was given for the breakdown, but analysts believe price was a
serious consideration. Figures of about Pounds 160m were rumoured at an
earlier stage.
Thorn EMI's shares, which have been weakening since the middle of the weak,
dropped a further 10p to 935p yesterday.
Thorn's strategy remains to concentrate on its core music and TV rental
businesses, and it is anxious to find another buyer. It is one of the
world's top three in publishing and recorded music, and Radio Rentals is the
world's biggest rental business.
Thorn has for some time been seeking a buyer for its defence business, which
includes radar and infra-red imaging. It employs about 4,300 people and has
a turnover of some Pounds 425m.
Since 1990 the company has disposed of numerous non-core businesses. The
most recent was light fittings, recently bought by a management buy-out team
for Pounds 162m. The controlling stake in Thames TV was also sold this year.
The sale would have strengthened GEC's dominant position in defence
electronics, and was thought a few weeks ago to be on the verge of
completion.

Sir, Michael Glover writes in his article, 'Poetry with perception' (July

I am one of the few. I wish I had learned a hundred times more than I did,

FT  07 AUG 93 / Nudge-nudge, wink-wink ..: Philip Stephens provides a guide
to the speculations and subtleties of pre-Budget fever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellors are kind to journalists. Mr Kenneth Clarke is no exception.
For several months each year they allow us to fill the newspapers and
airwaves with guesses, leaks and speculation (informed and otherwise) about
the Budget.
The latest occupant of No 11 Downing Street is an instinctively talkative
politician. He has abolished purdah, the two-month period before Budget day,
during which past chancellors have observed a monastic silence.
But Mr Clarke has not altered the practice which provides essential grist
for the media mill. All tax changes are decided by Treasury ministers and
their mandarins in conditions of the utmost secrecy.
This absurd rule guarantees that every nod, wink and raised eyebrow before
the first 'unified' Budget on November 30 has the potential to fill one of
those front page slots with a speculative certainty. Readers and listeners
are left with the awkward task of disentangling fact from fiction, genuine
hints and leaks from well-packaged inven-tion.
So what follows is a guide to pre-Budget fever - a few broad rules against
which the scare stories should be tested before they are believed.
The first thing to remember is that crucial decisions on the overall tax
burden - known in the trade as the Budget judgment - will not finally be
taken until mid-November.
Those late August stories (known more appropriately as 'flyers') asserting
that the chancellor has already decided to slap 2p on income tax and abolish
mortgage interest relief can safely be ignored.
Mr Clarke already has a fair idea of his overall aim. He wants government
borrowing to fall at a faster rate. He has already set tough targets for
public spending which will be unveiled alongside tax changes in the first
'unified' Budget bringing together the revenue and spending sides of the
government accounts.
But he will wait until the last moment before deciding whether to announce,
say, a net increase in the tax burden of Pounds 5bn or Pounds 10bn, or
whether to opt for a more neutral package. (You can rule out a net
'giveaway'). A premature judgment could too easily be overtaken by
subsequent economic developments.
His assessment is complicated further by the deferred tax increases, due in
1994 and 1995, put in place by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. Everyone
knows that Mr Lamont imposed value-added tax on domestic fuel and heating.
But his March package included 49 other measures ranging from tougher rules
for relocation expenses to a new exemption for outplacement counselling
(whatever that is).
There are other time bombs Mr Lamont left ticking in his successor's
battered red box. Among them are a 1-point rise in National Insurance
contributions, as well as restriction of mortgage interest relief and
married person's allowance to the 20p income tax rate from next April.
For every measure announced, the chancellor will discard up to half-a-dozen
other options. And since every occupant of No 11 wants to be known as a
'reforming chancellor', Mr Clarke will examine closely upwards of 200
possibilities.
Keeping track of all these options is impossible. But some clues can be
gleaned from representations by powerful lobby groups like the Confederation
of British Industry and from kite-flying by Whitehall departments.
The interventionist duo at trade and industry and at employment - Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr David Hunt - will want, for example, measures to promote a
pro-industry image. Extra help for exporters must be a good bet.
Mr Clarke's self-image as a 'people's chancellor' means the charity, low-pay
and welfare lobbies should get a fairer hearing than in some previous years
 -always remembering, of course, that he does not have cash to throw around.
But what of the big decisions - on income tax, VAT, excise duties, and
company taxation? Here the important point is that Mr Clarke is operating
within two sets of, often overlapping, parameters - economic and political.
The most obvious is the economic. Everyone knows he must cut the public
sector borrowing requirement. So some further increase in taxation is a
reasonable prospect.
But beware. Though they would never admit it publicly, few Whitehall
officials believe that the borrowing requirement will actually reach Pounds
50bn this year. The economy, and with it tax revenues, are growing faster
than the Treasury expected.
The best guess of those in Whitehall who know about these things is that Mr
Clarke may well get away with a net tax increase of between Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 6bn. Optimists say the range is from zero to Pounds 4bn. The few
remaining pessimists say Pounds 10bn. Here we come to the politics.
Mr Clarke's first priority will be to ensure that whatever he announces on
November 30 will come as a relief. So do not worry about the inevitable
explosion of pre-Budget doom-mongering.
An increase in the basic rate of income tax from 25p is off-limits. Even if
Mr Clarke wanted it, Mr Major would not accept it - nor would the restless
Tory backbenches. An increase in the 40p top tax rate is more plausible, but
would still smack of total retreat from the low-tax 1980s.
Unless he is overruled by his Downing Street neighbour, Mr Clarke will not
abandon even the second stage of the phased introduction of VAT on domestic
fuel. Chancellors cannot afford to retreat once measures are on the statute
book.
Nor should anyone pay too much attention to the speculation - judiciously
encouraged by the chancellor - that he is planning wholesale extension of
VAT to other zero-rated items like food and public transport.
Newspapers, maybe even books and magazines, could be a target. If the
technical obstacles could be overcome, the exemption from VAT of financial
services (at a cost of Pounds 3.3bn a year) might be another.
But Mr Clarke is smart enough not to follow up Mr Lamont's tax on warmth
with others on baked beans and bus rides.
Much easier, despite his own liking for more than the odd pint of beer and
small cigars, would be to slap a few pennies on the price of alcohol,
tobacco and petrol - though even here he will have to watch the impact on
the inflation rate.
Industry looks set to escape lightly. There are many in the Treasury who
believe companies did too well out of corporate tax reforms in the 1980s.
But a chancellor who applauds publicly the real people who make real things
can hardly follow up with a kick in the teeth for Midlands manufacturers.
None of this leaves much room for manoeuvre if Mr Clarke does decide he
needs to raise more than the odd billion or two. But here we come to perhaps
the safest bet.
He could raise more than Pounds 1bn by freezing the main income tax
thresholds. A whacking Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn could be had from restricting
the personal income tax allowance to the 20p rate of income tax.
Adjusting allowances would have the advantage of being perceived to be fair.
The high-income middle classes would suffer most. Some of the money could
even be given back to those on low incomes (the elderly defectors to the
Liberal Democrats in Christchurch) by extending the 20p tax band to, say,
the first Pounds 5,000 of taxable income.
A package like that - dressed up with a few other clever Treasury wheezes -
would have a distinctly Clarke-ish feel to it: tough but equitable.
But then all this, of course, is speculation.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Victorian values back in vogue: How the ERM debacle has
invigorated the gilts market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Predictions that the loosening of the shackles of the European exchange rate
mechanism would spell the end of the long-standing bull market in UK
government bonds proved inaccurate this week. In the event, the shake-up in
Europe's currency markets has given gilts a new lease of life.
Continental European countries are not rushing to ease interest rates, now
that they no longer need to keep them at artificially high levels to support
their currencies - unlike the UK, which slashed rates after sterling's hasty
exit from the ERM last September. Therefore the incentive to switch into
continental bond markets is less pressing.
In the meantime, long-term bond yields are still higher in the UK than in
many other European markets, and foreign investors are confident that
sterling will hold steady.
As a result, foreign investment flows into gilts and Eurosterling bonds have
shot up: the latest figures, for June, show gilt purchases of Pounds 1.1bn.
The inflow will help absorb this year's Pounds 50bn supply of gilts, which
is needed to bridge the widening budget gap.
Above all, the latest leg in the gilt-edged market's rally can be attributed
to the fact that 'people have become extremely optimistic on economic
fundamentals', according to Mr Chris Anthony, an economist at UBS, the Swiss
bank.
Low inflation and low growth are both positive news for the gilts market.
For economists, these factors point to a fall in real (with inflation
stripped out) yields, as well as nominal yields.
If this happens, investors with money in short-term deposit accounts could
find themselves earning negative interest, in real terms. 'If you wait until
that happens, you will have missed the boat,' because the market will
already have rallied, said Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell
Montagu, the gilts market maker.
Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, also
believes the gilts market is an attractive buy. 'The only reason you can
still get 7 3/4 per cent yields at the long end of the gilts market is that
investors have yet to appreciate fully that inflation is down and is staying
down this time,' he said.
Many economists are arguing in favour of index-linked gilts, which protect
investors against inflation and could outperform conventional bonds.
Index-linked bonds are also, adds Mr Juckes, 'as good a protection as you
can get against things going wrong'.
Although most investment institutions are perennial holders of gilts, the
question remains whether private investors will rediscover the market. In
the past, Britain's inflation record has discouraged retail investors.
Investors who bought Pounds 100 of gilts in 1945 would have seen the real
value fall to Pounds 29 by 1981, even if they had reinvested the gross
income each year.
Furthermore, short-term interest rates have been higher than long-term rates
for sustained periods during the past 20 years, giving private investors
little incentive to venture into the bond market.
The government has now recognised the role that private investors can play
in meeting its increased funding needs. In April, it published a booklet
explaining the complexities of the gilts market, and produced simpler
application forms for investors wishing to take part in its issue of 7 1/4
per cent 1998 stock. The National Savings Stock Register, which operates
through post offices, is a cheap and relatively easy route for private
investors to buy gilts.
Nevertheless, there are still some snags. Many gilts trade at above face
value, which means that an investor who holds an issue until maturity will
suffer a capital loss. Choosing an issue from the wide range of maturities
and coupons - or interest payments - can be bewildering for investors
accustomed to the relative simplicity of an instant access account.
The answer appears obvious - bond funds. These buy portfolios of gilts and
then sell units to private investors, who are thereby relieved of the
problem of choosing the right gilts issue and (if the fund is well managed)
likewise of the problem of capital loss.
Bond funds have yet to take off in the UK market, with less than Pounds 2bn
of such funds under management onshore, out of a Pounds 76bn total for all
unit trusts. One problem may be that the management charges take a chunk out
of the yield of the funds and make them less attractive to investors.
But in the US and continental Europe, private investors commonly hold their
savings in the form of bonds. In the 19th century, wealthy Britons used to
hold bonds for income - the family in John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga put
their trust in government-issued Consols. Perhaps this is one Victorian
value which is making a comeback.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: A policy prerequisite for tied European currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr RICHARD COGHLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan ('Europe will still need a monetary system', August 2)
is to be congratulated for drawing attention to the irresponsible behaviour
of the Bundesbank in its conduct of monetary policy. To be fair, the
Bundesbank does not want to set policy for Europe, but nor do the council
members want a separate European central bank. However, if European
currencies are to be tied together, monetary policy must be decided by
European interests, not those of a single economic area.
Make policy consistent with the system and there need be no problem.
Inconsistent policies produce instability; there should be no surprise over
recent events. ERM members have been trying to square the circle, with the
inevitable, disastrous consequences.
The same article also discussed the issue of inflation convergence, and this
is much more controversial. Mr Brittan, like most commentators, continues to
give most of the credit for lower inflation within Europe to the existence
of the ERM, even to the extent of donating the British victory to this
external constraint.
The ERM may have helped, but a wider perspective suggests the existence of a
more universal cause. Inflation has fallen around the world. In Japan it is
below 1 per cent. In Canada and Australia it is below 2 per cent and even
the US has inflation of about 3 per cent. All, it should be noted, without
benefit of the ERM.
Inflation came down because it was unacceptable to investors and the
electorate. The former raised the costs and reduced the benefits of
inflationary policies, which is what really upset the latter. This, in turn,
produced the political will for restraint. The ERM was incidental to this
process.
We shall not explain the future very well, nor deserve better policies than
we have had, if we do not explain the past correctly.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The arrogance is breathtaking. The advice given by their professionals,
whether good or bad, has to be paid for. The sums lost to the UK by some of
those 500 City firms wishing to be left in peace are enormous.
Yet they have the impertinence to wish to withhold rights to other traffic
to traverse their habitat - all in the name of security of their own lives
and possessions and the enjoyment of peace and a better environment.
I have no doubt that those working and living in the City benefit by the
restrictions, but why should the rest of us have to pay for this enormous
privilege; they are requesting it for no better reason than that it suits a
tiny coterie thriving on nepotism.
A short trial of the measures in the quasi-holiday period is not proof of
anything except the wish to rush them through before the enormity of the
obstructions is realised by the general public.
The householder has no right to the street in front of his building - the
City has no right to annexe its streets in the name of its own well-being.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: Lysold is not a viable answer for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R R S HISCOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr David Springbett (Letters, August 3) cannot go on getting away with
his 'Improved solution for Lloyd's'. His plan is worse than naive; it is
deceptively attractive to Names who have suffered enough and makes a number
of unsustainable false promises.
Mr Springbett's planned company, Lysold, is to take all the reserves from
syndicates and from Lloyd's centrally. Out of these reserves he will produce
a surplus of Pounds 1bn to capitalise Lysold and, without having to use any
Funds at Lloyd's of Names for 18 months, he will pay off all litigation.
He will also take over all run-off functions in Lloyd's, buy some managing
and members' agencies, triple hardship terms, underwrite the estate
protection plan, take over Lioncover's and Centrewrite's liabilities and
more. And, finally, he will have enough left over to underwrite 25 per cent
of Lloyd's capacity as a corporate Name in 1994.
His suggestion that 1994 Names and subsequent Names pay a 'royalty' of
between Pounds 250m and Pounds 500m a year for the next 25 years to Lysold
may explain some of the magic.
The only problem is that Lysold would be the only corporate Name at Lloyd's,
if not the only Name. The providers of corporate capital have made it quite
clear they are not prepared to pay for past losses. Lysold, if ever licensed
by any authority, would be clearly unviable; 1994 syndicates would not have
a penny of cash or reserves, having surrendered them all to Lysold. There
would be no central fund, so I doubt that we would have many Names for 1994,
or that many of our clients would value our security.
The current management is striving to reform Lloyd's to take advantage of
favourable market conditions.
It is a great pity that we cannot all unite in that purpose. Ill-considered
'improved solutions', prepared without consultation with the management or
our advisers, are an unhelpful distraction.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Cheap money is no bargain: US visitors are not attracted by
cheaper currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, ALICE RAWSTHORN and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buckingham Palace opens its doors to the public today, providing London with
a new attraction which the UK tourist industry hopes will help bring back
the Americans.
All of Europe's main tourist centres are waiting to see whether high summer
will provide proof that US visitor numbers are on the increase. Some
European hoteliers say they have had more US visitors this year than last.
But despite the depreciation of the pound, the franc and the Italian lira
against the dollar over the past year, and further currency turmoil this
week, Americans have generally been slow to take advantage of cheaper
prices.
The British Tourist Authority says 1.1m North Americans visited the UK in
the first five months of this year, slightly down on last year's 1.2m and
still below the level of 1990, the year before the Gulf War. Visitor numbers
to the UK from the rest of Europe are far healthier.
Leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster say that occupancy in London's
hotels rose 4.3 percentage points to 69.3 per cent in the first half of
1993, compared with the same period last year. North Americans, however,
accounted for only 21 per cent of hotel guests in the capital, compared with
22.8 per cent in 1992.
In France, the Regional Committee for Tourism said it was too early to
provide any firm statistics, but added that US tourism to Paris has
'definitely fallen' so far in 1993.
Precisely how many Americans are visiting Italy is difficult to determine,
as the tourism ministry closed permanently this week, following a popular
referendum decision in April to devolve its powers to the prime minister's
office and regional governments. Although Alitalia, the Italian state
airline, says passenger traffic from the US has risen by about 4 per cent
this year, some analysts had been expecting a sharper increase.
Many European tourism officials have been puzzled by the failure of the
Americans to arrive in large numbers. US visitors to the UK, France and
Italy can now get more local currency for their dollars than a year ago. On
the first Monday in August this year, a US dollar would have bought 64p,
FFr5.60 and L1,574 at Thomas Cook branches in the UK, France and Italy
respectively. On the first Monday in August 1992, a dollar would have bought
49p, FFr4.65 and L1,088.
Mr Robert Franklin, marketing director of the BTA in the US, says the
authority, along with airlines and other travel companies, has spent Dollars
750,000 spreading the message that Britain is now a cheaper destination,
with full-page advertisements in the American press. The authority has also
sent out 'an awful lot of press releases to papers in the US'. The message
has taken a long time to get through. 'It's a bit depressing,' he says.
Surprisingly, terrorist bomb attacks in Europe do not appear to be the
reason American visitor numbers have been disappointing. After each IRA
attack in the UK, Mr Franklin says his staff have 'sat braced, waiting for
the phones to ring. They haven't'
Although Florence, Rome and Milan have been rocked by bombs, local hotels
report few cancellations by Americans. That contrasts with US reactions in
the mid-1980s, when terrorist incidents at Rome airport and on the Achille
Lauro cruise ship provoked a huge wave of cancellations.
Many in the travel industry point out that the price of holidays in Europe
is only one factor Americans consider when deciding whether to venture
abroad. Among the reasons cited for the disappointing numbers of Americans
in Europe are that the US economy is recovering only fitfully, that many
still fear unemployment, that they are worried about possible tax increases,
and that much of the optimism generated by President Bill Clinton's election
last year has dissipated.
The picture has not been uniformly gloomy. Some companies that have marketed
themselves heavily in the US say they have had a healthy increase in
American visitors. Forte, the UK's largest hotel group, says American
visitor numbers have increased significantly since the start of the year,
although it declined to give specific figures. Forte says US visitors are
still looking for value for money; the group's three-star hotels have had
bigger increases in American visitors than its five-star establishments.
Ciga, the luxury hotel chain controlled by the Aga Khan, says US guest
numbers at its 19 Italian hotels climbed by 20 per cent in the first six
months of 1993. At the group's three Venetian hotels, the figures increased
by 35 per cent. In Rome, the figure rose 25 per cent.
Ciga, which is facing a severe financial crisis, has marketed heavily to US
tourists, with special offers such as sightseeing tours included in room
prices.
There are signs of optimism elsewhere. Mr Franklin says that a recent
meeting in New York of companies selling holidays to the UK brought evidence
that business had improved over the past month. Travel managers throughout
Europe concur.
Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy Hotel group in London, says
the number of Americans staying at the Savoy in July was 15 per cent up on
last year. He says: 'I feel positive for the first time in 18 months.'
Madame Tussauds, the London waxworks museum which is owned by Pearson,
publisher of the FT, says the number of US visitors rose 12 per cent in the
second quarter of this year after falling 23 per cent in the first quarter.
In Paris, the tourist office on the Champs-Elysees reports a recent rise in
inquiries from Americans. The exclusive Hotel de Crillon has also detected a
slight increase in bookings from the US. 'Our American clients have always
taken advantage of better prices when the dollar has strengthened in the
past, so we should see an improvement over the next few months,' the Crillon
says, adding that the FFr26,000 bill for a night in the its presidential
suite would come to just Dollars 4,375 this weekend - a snip compared with
Dollars 4,655 a month ago.
Mr Henry Blinder, marketing vice- president at Thomas Cook Travel in the US,
says that Americans returning home with tales of their travels will
encourage others in the US to holiday in Europe. 'Travellers will come back
and pass on the word that the value and the bargains are there,' he says.
The problem is that even with newly strengthened dollars in their money
belts, many Americans still find Europe too expensive. Ms Cynthia Belcher, a
recent law graduate from Indiana University, has spent the past few weeks
travelling in France and the UK. On her first visit to Europe, she has
enjoyed the cafes of Paris, and London's mixture of bustling streets and
quiet parks and squares.
She has, however, been astonished by the prices. 'Food, gasoline, beer,
entertainment, everything. I don't think people in the US realise how
expensive it is over here.' Is she aware that she would have found Europe
even more expensive a year ago? 'I can't believe that,' she says.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: Government must grasp opportunity for trade mark
legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASDAIR POORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I note that the government has indicated that it intends to find time
to implement the new trade mark legislation. It has done so before. Let us
hope that it does not let the opportunity slip this time.
the proposals have wide support and are not contentious;
they would be likely to help both British industry and foreign investment;
the government had an obligation to implement the EC trade mark directive at
the beginning of this year.
In the spirit of prompt ratification of the Maastricht treaty it should not
delay further.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Man in the News: Franc could be the death of him - A foreign
exchange dealer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanley Smartcash, one of London's top currency dealers, drove back to his
Knightsbridge flat last night, skipped the regular Friday visit to the gym
and told his wife about the hardest week he had ever had in the foreign
exchange market.
'We made a fortune selling sterling last year and a packet out of the
peseta,' said the 39-year-old head of foreign exchange (FX) at Global, the
US investment bank. 'But there have been times this week when the French
franc looked as if it would make a killing out of all of us.'
Stanley, an elegantly dressed Londoner with an ability to charm, is one of
many foreign exchange managers recovering this weekend after a momentous 10
days in the currency markets: a period that shook the European exchange rate
mechanism, saw the effective flotation of the French franc and some of the
largest money flows ever in London's dealing rooms.
On Monday, Stanley had hoped a devaluation of the French franc would bring
Global the same profits it had received from the demise of sterling last
September when it was forced to leave the ERM.
He recalled how on Black Wednesday Giovanni, his suave Italian chief dealer,
had taken over Global's proprietary trading book, the one containing the
bank's own money, and sold the pound for D-Marks at a rate of DM2.778. Next
day, Giovanni bought sterling back cheap at DM2.60, a net profit of more
than 6 per cent in 24 hours.
In comparison, trading in the French franc was a nightmare this week. After
the relaxation of the ERM rules on Sunday, it slumped on Monday, stabilised
on Tuesday and soared on Wednesday. By yesterday afternoon, Global was, at
best, only a few million pounds up on the week. Stanley's button-down,
white, Hilditch &amp; Key shirt was looking unusually crumpled at the end of the
week's trading.
But after 15 years in the market, Stanley is used to the roller-coaster
world of currency dealing. Occasionally he becomes incensed at the public's
attitude. The phrase 'Anglo-Saxon conspiracy' makes him laugh - although
French politicians often refer to it, it does not exist. The words 'barrow
boy' make him wince.
'People think the industry's filled with idiots, but that's nonsense,' he
regularly tells his wife. Yes, when he is managing trades in the office, his
manner with the junior dealers can be brutal. But he has a sophisticated
side, too. What about his 2:1 in French from Oxford? What about his
knowledge of the highly technical aspects of the derivatives market, the
esoteric world of options, forwards and delta hedging?
And what journalists and politicians never understand is that not all of an
FX manager's time is spent pushing buttons. Much of it is spent out of the
office, flying to Paris, New York and Frankfurt, talking to the bank's
blue-chip clients: the pension funds, the insurance companies and the big
multinationals.
These are the really big players in foreign exchange, sophisticated fund
managers with billions of dollars under their control and anxious to hedge
their bond exposures. 'Getting to know the clients, managing their
investments and taking a premium on the buy/sell spread: that's the basis of
Global's earnings whether there's a currency crisis or not,' Stanley says.
He rarely allows the public perception of spivvy dealers to get him down. He
is addicted to deals. He trades a large part of the bank's proprietary book
when in the office. And, at lunch, he loves to play with his pocket Reuters
machine, which gives the latest moves in the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate.
There has never been a better time to be in the business. Global's foreign
exchange balance sheet since Black Wednesday has been pushed up not only by
trading in fund managers' money but also by Stanley's aggressive risk-taking
with the firms' own capital.
Turnover was up 100 per cent in the past three years; there was a bigger net
profit in the first half of 1993 than in the whole of the previous year; and
the discreet mention of 'our outstanding capital markets activities' in
Global's glossy annual report is a source of pride.
Stanley's annual take-home pay, including bonuses, should be in the Pounds
400,000 area by Christmas. Assuming, that is, that the French franc behaves
itself. Stanley cannot help but daydream about events since last weekend.
On Sunday night, he was inside Global's glass and concrete building near St
Paul's, waiting with his top dealers for the results of the EC finance
ministers meeting.
At once, he knew that the widening of the ERM bands was a technical way of
floating the whole system. 'The Germans have kicked sand in France's face,'
he told Giovanni and the team. 'The French will cut interest rates. We could
be looking at FFr3.60 to the D-Mark by Friday.'
On Monday morning, some of his hedge fund clients were asking him to take
massive speculative positions on their behalf against the franc. He, too,
decided to take a risk with Global's own book.
But the cut in French rates never came. France jacked up the cost of
borrowing francs and nearly pushed the currency back into its old ERM
trading range. The market was outmanoeuvred, and the choice for every
risk-taker was the same: take a loss on the exchange rate or hang on, paying
the French banks a huge interest rate premium. The losses ate into Global's
FX profits.
Still, Stanley will not lose much sleep. The future for currency dealing
looks rosier than ever now the ERM has effectively gone. There will be
greater currency volatility. Those pension funds will be even more keen to
buy Global's financial products, hedging their bond portfolios against
currency risk in these wild times. And the French will not keep their rates
high for long.
But somewhere in the back of his mind Stanley may be starting to consider
how long the turmoil can last. France has shown how keen it is to hang on to
the D-Mark. And, in 18 months, when German rates are down at lower levels,
Europe's currencies may be back in the straitjacket again, only this time it
will be tighter. If Stanley Smartcash is really smart, he might be giving
some thought to becoming a Ferrari salesman.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's Euro-wishes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S instant reaction to the result of last weekend's torrid
negotiations over the future of monetary co-operation in Europe already
seems a little premature. Describing the outcome as a vindication of his
decision to suspend sterling's membership last September, the British prime
minister suggested that the effective collapse of the hard version of the
exchange rate mechanism should accelerate economic recovery in Europe. He
hinted that it could strengthen the case for further cuts in British
interest rates and added that the Maastricht timetable for European monetary
union was now 'totally unrealistic'. But first impressions can be
misleading. A week later, none of Mr Major's assertions appears particularly
secure.
On his first point - the vindication of Black Wednesday - Mr Major's case
remains weak. The UK was forced out of the ERM last September because the
currency markets knew that the British economy's structural weaknesses made
staying in the ERM at a parity of DM2.95 untenable. By contrast, France,
Belgium and Denmark, all credibly low inflation countries, were forced last
weekend to widen the ERM bands because they could no longer sensibly live
with the high levels of real interest rates that Germany's structural
difficulties were transmitting across Europe.
Mr Major's half-hearted justification of events last September helps explain
why his first prediction - the expected falls in European interest rates -
has not yet materialised. Indeed, the French government has resisted the
opportunity to reduce its short-term money market interest rates even from
the double digit rates to which they were pushed to defend the currency.
Going for growth
One reason for this apparent obstinacy is an unwillingness on the part of
the French establishment to admit that the franc fort policy of shadowing
the D-Mark is no longer the route either to low inflation or economic
stability. Another is that French prime minister Edouard Balladur does not
want to appear to have been forced into the same position as Mr Major: a
national leader who, having failed to defend an ERM parity, was forced to
make the best of a bad lot by cutting interest rates and declaring that he
was now 'going for growth'.
But Mr Major's first prediction will probably prove correct in the end. It
makes no sense for countries with inflation rates half that of Germany, and
suffering deepening recessions, to maintain short-term real interest rates
which remain twice as high as Germany's. French, Belgian and Danish interest
rates may well not fall as far or as fast as Britain's. But economic logic
does suggest that they must fall sooner rather than later. British exporters
should be preparing for modest European growth.
Last week's events do not suggest, however, that lower European rates will
necessarily be accompanied by lower British interest rates. If sterling and
the D-Mark had soared against Europe's depreciating currencies, then the
need to cap such an appreciation by cutting British rates would have been
compelling. But far from plunging dramatically, the French franc closed
yesterday a mere 1.7 per cent lower against the D-Mark than last week's
close. The franc might well even rise against the D-Mark when the French
government finally cuts rates.
Persistent deficits
In any case, a cut in British interest rates looks desirable on domestic
economic grounds. The Confederation of British Industry's latest monthly
survey appeared to confirm that the recovery now under way is weak and
patchy. The absence of inflationary pressures and persistent trade and
fiscal deficits both argue for a looser monetary policy balanced by further
fiscal tightening. Regardless of what happens in Europe a further cut in UK
interest rates looks to be an essential element in Mr Major's strategy to
revive the government's dismal performance in the opinion polls.
Yet despite Mr Major's scepticism about the Maastricht timetable, the events
of the past week do not necessarily mean that his European difficulties are
behind him. France and Germany, far from rushing to distance themselves from
monetary union, have been at pains to suggest that stage two of monetary
union - the establishment of the European Monetary Institute followed by the
fixing of ERM parities in narrow bands - will go ahead as planned at the
beginning of next year.
This may well prove to be bravado. It will depend, as always, on the
willingness of the Bundesbank to bring German interest rates down fast
enough to make a rapid return to narrow bands politically and economically
sustainable.
But the traumas of the last months do suggest that northern Europe will have
to choose between carrying on indefinitely with the current dirty floating
and moving more rapidly to some form of monetary union. Former chancellor
Norman Lamont and other Euro-sceptics believe that Emu is dead. Mr Major
will hope they are right. What matters is whether France and Germany agree.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Fated to share the same cage: Ian Davidson examines the
future of Franco-German relations after the humiliating shockwaves of recent
days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week is a long time in politics; in the crisis which has hit the European
Community's plans for monetary integration, it is an eternity. On Monday, it
seemed the weekend monetary crisis had delivered a fatal reverse to the
future of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and a damaging blow to Europe's
pivotal relationship - between Germany and France. Today, the future looks
less certain; even the present is unclear.
Five days ago, most commentators agreed that the European Monetary System
was in tatters, the programme for economic and monetary union had suffered a
comprehensive defeat, and the Maastricht treaty was now void of economic
credibility. Just as important was the political corollary: that the
Bundesbank had inflicted a crushing humiliation on France.
France's conservative newspaper, Le Figaro, described it as a 'shock-wave
shaking Europe'. Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper crowed:
'Euro-money is stone dead - hurrah, the D-Mark is still there]' Mr Norman
Lamont, Britain's former chancellor, said: 'This is the end of the ERM in
all but name.'
Today, it looks as though these judgments may need some qualification. It is
clear that the foreign exchange crisis has debunked old ERM certainties.
With bands of 15 per cent above or below the central parity, the ERM is a
different beast from one with bands of 2 1/4 per cent.
What we do not yet know is how European governments will manage their
currency convergence in the months ahead. The market forces that broke the
system assumed that, in a deepening recession, the French government could
not long tolerate high interest rates. The past few days have suggested,
however, that France may be prepared to resist the temptation of an early
cut in rates. The result is the franc has not moved far from its old level
against the D-Mark.
Moreover, it appears that the Belgians want to revert to a narrow-band
arrangement with the Germans. One surprising possibility, therefore, is that
the pattern of European exchange rates, at least for a small group of
inner-core countries, may strongly resemble the pre-crisis period.
One reason why the French have not immediately cut their interest rates is
that they need to rebuild their foreign reserves, badly depleted supporting
the franc last week. The more important factor is that the government
remains steadfast on its franc fort policy.
In the build-up to the crisis, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur
repeatedly pledged he would resign rather than devalue. This week, he
insisted the value of the franc and its central rate in the EMS had been
maintained - the implication being that it was policy to keep the franc near
its old level.
Before going on holiday on Thursday, Mr Balladur repeated that French
economic policy objectives remained unchanged: namely, 'monetary stability,
reduction of deficits, control of inflation and reduction of the tax
burden'.
French resistance to devaluation could put a new gloss on the medium-term
outlook for the exchange rate mechanism. Last weekend the 12 EC members
states declared that phase two of Emu would start on schedule on January 1.
Phase two is the preparatory stage for monetary union during which the
currencies of all countries wanting to join are confined to narrow bands in
which the possibility of realign-ment is precluded for two years before they
can join Emu.
Most commentators wrote this off as whistling in the wind. They believe the
new wide bands are a prelude to more currency uncertainty. But the German
and French governments are adamant they are wrong.
'I am absolutely sure,' a senior German official said this week, 'that phase
two of Emu will start on time. The franc will not go down and, if our
economies pick up, it will be easier to reach the criteria for economic
convergence. The new situation is, shall we say, more interesting; but the
old time-table is still valid.'
Mr Balladur, evidently, does not assume things will be quite so simple. 'A
European monetary system must be rebuilt on new bases,' he said after last
weekend's crisis meeting. 'This system must not be subject, like its
predecessor, to repeated crises which are incompatible with the recovery of
our economy.'
The problem is that the fundamental tension in the system, between Germany
and its EC partners, is unresolved. The Bundesbank is determined to squeeze
domestic inflation induced by the costs of unification; but the resulting
high interest rates force Bonn's partners to make an invidious choice
between deflation and devaluation.
Mr Balladur did not disguise his view this week that German monetary policy
was to blame for the crisis. 'What is the reason for this speculation? It is
certainly not in our economy. The cause of the speculation is the
persistance of high interest rates in Germany.'
Since it is the German economy which is out of step with the rest of Europe,
the French had proposed that the D-Mark should temporarily
leave the ERM. Indeed, Mr Balladur maintained this week that the Germans had
been ready to go along with this solution. Some German officials have denied
this, though Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, has appeared
tacitly to admit it. He told a press conference in Bonn this week: 'Several
countries said that having Germany as an anchor was vital, and that they
intended to stick to this policy, for which they saw no alternative.'
For the moment, Mr Balladur is sticking to his hard franc policy. But in the
months ahead he will be squeezed between the January 1 deadline for phase
two of Emu, and domestic demands for lower interest rates and faster
economic growth.
This pressure will be most intense among his supporters in the conservative
Gaullist RPR party. On one hand, they fear for their prospects of winning
the 1995 presidential election if the government does not deliver economic
recovery and a fall in unemployment.
On the other, many are hostile to the Maastricht treaty, and see the
currency crisis as an opportunity to ditch the programme for monetary union.
Even Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullists and the party's candidate
for the 1995 poll, seems to be keeping his options open. On Monday he warmly
endorsed government policy, but seemed to call for a more expansionary
economic posture.
It seems that the new wide-band regime in the ERM has given France, and the
EC a breathing space, but hard choices still lie ahead. After the summer
holidays, the French will have to test the options for lower interest rates;
and the EC will have to decide whether it really can go into the next phase
of Emu and, if so, on what terms.
The fundamental question now is whether this currency crisis has cast a
serious political shadow over prospects for European integration and, in
particular, over relations between France and Germany. The programme for
Emu, and the broader negotiations on the Maastricht treaty, like all recent
initiatives in the EC, have been driven by the close co-operation between
Paris and Bonn. But Emu could come to grief over the tension between German
and French economic interests.
Judged by the angry denunciations in French newspapers, Paris and Bonn would
seem to be experiencing a serious political fallout. Even Mr Raymond Barre,
the former conservative prime minister, went so far as to denounce the
'dogmatic attitude' of the Bundesbank. But most analysts discount talk of a
political showdown.
'This probably won't cause any lasting damage,' according to Mr Pierre
Jacquet of the French foreign policy institute, IFRI. 'In practice the
crisis will produce a reaction of closer co-operation.' Mr Jacques Lecacheux
of OFCE, the economic policy institute, argues France and Germany are, in
fact, in close agreement on how to solve the crisis.
Moreover, the partnership between France and Germany has been so close for
so long that neither can easily imagine an alternative. This is partly a
consequence of their shared history through three wars; it is also a
reflection of their economic integration, in which each is the other's
leading trading partner.
There is, however, no doubt that Franco-German relations are not as close at
the moment as they have sometimes been. Policy disagreements, such as that
over the break-up of Yugoslavia, have left a nasty taste. And, if there is a
real danger of lasting conflict, it is most likely to come over the the
Uruguay Round of talks on trade liberalisation under the rubric of the
General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
According to a senior German official, the ERM crisis had 'absolutely not'
caused any political damage. But he stressed that, in the trade field and
over Gatt, there were real differences of philosophy.
Yet most commentators believe the partnership will remain solid because
there is no alternative. 'We must build a more confident Franco-German
relationship than we have had in recent weeks,' declares Mrs Elisabeth
Guigou, a close confidant of President Francois Mitterrand. 'We must never
forget that the Franco-German understanding is the basis of Europe. To
imagine other alliances is an illusion.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / Nuclear plant gets safety extension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned power company, was yesterday given
permission by safety inspectors for the first time to extend to three years
the operating periods between statutory shutdowns at an advanced gas-cooled
reactor.
Permission has been granted for the Hartlepool AGR three years after Nuclear
Electric applied to extend the statutory period there from two years.
The Health and Safety Executive said the extension marked a significant
change in the operation of nuclear power reactors. Since licensing began in
1960 all power reactors have been subject to statutory shutdowns every two
years.
Nuclear Electric, which operates nuclear plants in England and Wales, hopes
for similar extensions at its other four AGRs.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said Nuclear Electric was
trading off economics for safety. Faults would go undetected for longer, it
said.
Nuclear Electric said safety was a priority and the case to the HSE 'took
full account of our own stringent safety requirements'. A typical safety
shutdown at an AGR lasted 10 weeks and cost about Pounds 20m, including lost
sales of electricity.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Timing of mail price rise attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Post Office Users' National Council yesterday criticised the timing of
proposals to raise the price of first and second class mail by 1p from
November 1, Tim King writes.
The users' watchdog is extending its normal three-week period for receiving
representations to six weeks and has told the Post Office and the Department
of Trade and Industry that its report will be delayed. It argued that it
would be difficult to consult interested parties during the holiday period.
Mr Jim Cousins, Labour Post Office spokesman, said the proposal to charge
25p for first-class letters and 19p for second class followed directly from
the Treasury's demands for more cash from the Post Office.
He said the government required the Post Office to contribute Pounds 181m
for 1993-94, and Pounds 176m and Pounds 158m in the following two years.
The DTI said it was appropriate to expect more revenue from a profit-making
body at a time of strain on the exchequer.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Shoppers pick up 'green' habits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH shoppers are increasingly environmentally aware, are buying more
healthy products, and are becoming accustomed to shopping on Sundays, says a
survey published yesterday by Nielsen, the marketing information group.
The British Shopper 1993, Nielsen's second annual survey of purchasing
habits, found that more than half the UK's consumers have stopped buying
aerosols, three-quarters try to purchase recycled paper products when
possible, and one in two take used bottles to bottle banks.
Women and young people were generally more environmentally aware than men
and the older generation, and those in the ABC1 socio-economic group were
'greener' than those in the C2DE groups.
UK consumers were buying more healthy products. Sales of low-fat and
low-calorie pre-packed salads have grown more than twice as fast as the rest
of the pre-packed salad market in the past year, accounting for almost 20
per cent of the market. Nielsen said 15 per cent of coffee sales were for
decaffeinated, and low-calorie drinks took more than 30 per cent of the
fizzy-drinks market. Low-fat products took more than half the butter and
margarine market.
The study found 3 per cent of households now shop on a Sunday, compared with
only 1 per cent last year. This suggests that Sunday shopping is becoming
more widely accepted in England and Wales, even though legal restrictions
still apply. One household in eight shops on Sunday at least once a month.
Shoppers also tend to spend more on Sundays than on other days of the week,
with one in six Sunday shopping baskets valued at more than Pounds 60,
compared with one in 10 on weekdays.
The survey provided further evidence of two important trends in retailing.
Firstly, price is of increasing importance to consumers. UK shoppers were
more likely to be influenced by price reductions than any other kind of
promotion. Consumers in the Midlands and southern England were most likely
to purchase goods on special offer.
It also confirmed that almost a quarter of all grocery sales were accounted
for by retailers' own-label products. The percentage was highest in chilled
foods, at 31 per cent, and lowest in pet foods, where loyalty to
manufacturers' branded products was still high.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Council fined Pounds 25,000 after tenant's death
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER City Council was yesterday fined the maximum of Pounds 25,000
following the death of an elderly tenant after hundreds of gas heaters were
wrongly installed by its workers.
Mr Paul Blackburn of the Health and Safety Executive told Mr Derrick
Fairclough, Manchester stipendiary magistrate, that 800 of 1,840 gas
warm-air heaters installed on 19 council estates in a replacement programme
had had to be switched off to ensure the tenants' safety.
Mr Albert Mason, 75, died after a metal plate that should have been screwed
in was fixed with adhesive tape and another plate had become detached,
letting carbon monoxide circulate around his flat.
Mr Blackburn said 'few if any' of the workers who fitted the heaters had
experience of such systems. In spite of the large scale of the scheme the
council 'did not give proper instructions to their employees specifying
methods of installation or quality checks'.
There were no arrangements to check safety, methods of installation were
improvised and the acting supervisor in charge of the replacement on Mr
Mason's estate had received no training or instructions on his
responsibilities.
Mr Blackburn added: 'The consequences of so many heaters wrongly installed
could have been far more serious. It is suggested this arose from attitudes
in the council leading to complacency.'
The council, which pleaded guilty, was fined the maximum of Pounds 5,000
under gas safety regulations for Mr Mason's death and the maximum Pounds
20,000 under the Health and Safety at Work Act for failing to carry out
checks on the other heaters. It was ordered to pay Pounds 500 costs.
Mr Fairclough said: 'The maximum fine within my power is really insufficient
punishment for what happened.'
Mr Charles Garside QC, for the council, expressed its sincere regret to Mr
Mason's family. He said Miss Penny Badcoe, the chief officer of the direct
works department, had resigned and no effort was being spared to identify
those responsible for the deficient installations.
Mr Garside added: 'There are going to be no scapegoats but on the other hand
nobody is going to be protected from proper action being taken against them.
This is not the place where it is sought to identify some low-level employee
and put all the blame on them.'
It is understood the council is facing more than a dozen civil actions from
tenants who claim their health was affected by fumes from the wrongly
installed heaters.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Landowners count cost as grouse numbers fall: Alison
Maitland on why this year's shooting season may be far from glorious - and
the knock-on effects for tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNUAL grouse-shooting season is to open next Thursday, August 12, and
most likely with a whimper rather than a bang. It is the owners of the
upland moors, not the grouse, who will have cause to complain this year.
A sharp fall in numbers of the game bird has caused many estates in northern
England and Scotland to postpone the annual shoot for several weeks or to
cancel it altogether.
Mr Michael Clarke, managing director of Buccleuch Estates in the Borders, is
delaying the season until September and limiting it to regular customers.
He expects to lose at least Pounds 100,000 from the three estates. 'It's
very sad and we don't like doing it, but you can't shoot your stock,' he
says. 'In financial terms it's pretty painful for us.'
For many landowners the Glorious Twelfth will mean digging deeper into
savings. Losses on the Lloyd's insurance market have left some without the
safety net they would have used in lean years. Alternative income, such as
sheep farming and deer stalking, bring much lower returns, and the tax
incentives that encouraged some estates to sell land for forestry have
ended.
The drastic decline in bird numbers has been caused by a combination of
natural forces, says Mr Peter Hudson, manager of upland research at the Game
Conservancy, an independent conservation trust on the edge of the
Cairngorms. A heavy fall of snow on the heather moors in May froze the first
brood of chicks before they hatched. Second broods are still too young to
shoot.
In England, flocks have been infected by strongylosis, a disease which
leaves females too sick to rear their chicks.
Mr Hudson estimates that the number of birds on the Scottish moors is down
by nearly two-thirds on an average year. In some places the situation is
even worse - a count in one part of northern England found only 50 birds to
a square kilometre, compared with 650 last year.
The shortage means losses for the estates, which have to pay their
gamekeepers and maintain their land even if there is no shooting. Britain
has 459 estates devoted to grouse, covering 4m acres.
'On many estates there's no other income,' says Mr Jamie Illingworth of
Strutt and Parker, the land agents. 'They've got the heather and the rock,
and grouse is the crop.'
Tourism is suffering, too. The shooters - Americans and continental
Europeans as well as British businessmen - tend to be big spenders.
'They don't stint themselves,' says Mr Dennis Fulford-Talbot, general
manager of the George Hotel in Chollerford, Northumberland. 'They drink very
good clarets and the best ports and brandies.' He usually has four or five
shooting parties of up to 20 people each, bringing in between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 6,000 per party. This year there have been no bookings.
On the moors, a party of eight can expect to pay Pounds 5,000 for a day's
shooting in a good year, bagging 120 birds between them.
'We've cancelled about 30 days of shooting - that's about Pounds 150,000
worth,' says Mr John Ormiston, managing director of Sport in Scotland, which
organises shooting holidays on 50 estates. The Treasury stands to lose on
that sum to the tune of Pounds 26,250 in value added tax.
There will be fewer seasonal jobs for beaters in this year's grouse season,
and local shops, woollen mills and car-hire companies will suffer. A study
by Strathclyde University estimated indirect expenditure of grouse-shooting
parties in Scotland at Pounds 9.5m in 1989.
Most estates are biting the bullet and hoping for a turnround next year  -
Scotland had a poor season last year as well.
Nobody is yet predicting the demise of the grouse estates. It is a business
where you have to take a long-term view, and landowners tend to have deep
pockets, says Mr Ormiston. 'You don't own grouse moors to make money. You
own them because you've got money.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / Investor safety net pays out Pounds 18.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in claims from victims of alleged negligent investment advice
brought a big increase in compensation payments by the Investors
Compensation Scheme last year.
In its annual report, published yesterday, the scheme said it had paid
compensation of Pounds 18.6m to 1,723 investors in the year ending March 31.
In the previous year it had paid Pounds 12.5m to 1,598 investors.
ICS, run by the Securities and Investments Board, acts as a safety net to
compensate private investors when a firm authorised under the scheme fails
and is unable to pay investors their claims. It declared 38 firms in default
last year, bringing the total to 91 since ICS began in August 1988. Since
April, another 11 firms have been declared in default.
Mr Richard Lawson, ICS chairman, said: 'The number of defaults by firms and
the volume of claims has continued to rise.' The firms declared in default
during 1992-93 were smaller than those affected in earlier years.
Mr Lawson said claims were being based on the grounds of negligent advice
rather than misappropriation or theft. In 1991-92, negligence-related claims
made up a third of all compensation claims, compared with two-thirds in
1992-93.
Mr Lawson singled out home income plans as being of particular concern.
During the property boom of the 1980s many investors took out loans against
their homes and entered investment schemes to pay the loan's interest and
give them some income.
The fall in house values in the early 1990s and the subsequent rise in
interest rates left many investors paying out more than they received. Many
compensation claims were filed against such schemes.
Mr Lawson said the ICS had made 'considerable headway with claims arising
from home income plans where investors were advised by authorised firms to
enter into generally inappropriate, complex and financially hazardous
arrangements'. The ICS has received more than 1,600 claims over home-income
plans and paid or offered compensation of more than Pounds 16m.
Mr Lawson said ICS had dealt with more than two-thirds of the claims, but
said lack of information from investors and firms meant claims were not
being processed as quickly as he wanted.
He said: 'We are keenly aware, particularly in home-income plan defaults, of
the urgency relating to claims, and through direct contact with the
claimants we appreciate the distress they have suffered.'
The ICS has declared in default Money Flow - the Exeter firm trading as D.
Lacy-Hulbert - which was authorised as a life assurance, unit trusts and
pensions intermediary.

FT  07 AUG 93 / SNP leader hits out at southern 'subsidy junkies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEED to stave off the mounting threat to the Conservative vote in the
south of England will lead to more government decisions favouring that
region, Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, predicted
yesterday.
Speaking a week after the Tories lost their traditionally safe seat of
Christchurch, Dorset, to the Liberal Democrats, Mr Salmond used a keynote
speech on the Scottish economy to brand the inhabitants of south-east
England as 'the subsidy junkies of the UK'.
The 'myth' of the subsidised Scot had been 'substantially scotched', he
said, arguing that the UK defence budget represented 'an effective regional
policy five or six times as powerful as the whole official regional aid
expenditure'. Much of the government's economic policy was 'a loosely
disguised ramp' for the south.
In the second of a series of five or six speeches leading to the annual SNP
party conference in Dunoon, Strathclyde, next month, Mr Salmond said
Scotland would be substantially better off as an independent nation.
Constitutional change was the key to Scotland's economic prosperity since it
would enable it to escape the UK's 'inevitable decline'.
Mr Salmond resisted the temptation to gloat over Scotland's recent
comparatively buoyant economic performance: 'I find little cause for
celebration just because we are suffering slightly less economic misery than
many of our English neighbours.'
He said Scottish gross domestic product might be 10 per cent lower in 1997
than would be the case in an independent Scotland.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Postal strike may spread after talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ESCALATION of the five-day postal strike at Cardiff looks possible this
weekend after yesterday's negotiations between Post Office management and
officials of the Union of Communication Workers failed to achieve a
settlement.
Further talks will be held today to try to resolve the dispute over new
shift-working patterns, which involves 900 staff at two Royal Mail offices
in Cardiff.
Royal Mail staff in Oxford and Worcester have already decided in secret
ballots not to handle any of the mail affected by the dispute. Further
ballots are being held among postal workers in Bristol, Southampton and
Gloucester. Talks in Gloucester have so far lasted more than 20 hours over
two days.
The strike is delaying mail addressed to Companies House - the government's
business registration headquarters in Cardiff - and the Federation of Small
Businesses has warned that this could trigger financial penalties for
companies if accounts and returns arrive late.
An estimated 1m letters lie undelivered at Royal Mail sorting depots around
Britain. About 2,500 postboxes in Cardiff have been sealed.
The parcel service and delivery of registered mail are unaffected so far, as
is the Post Office counter service.
Mr Graham Hall, head of Cardiff Chamber of Commerce, said local companies
were making alternative arrangements through private courier services and
using faxes, but business customers outside south Wales were still unaware
of the dispute and were continuing to send mail to Cardiff.
The dispute began on Tuesday when staff walked out in protest at the Post
Office's decision to introduce a fixed pattern of shift-working in its
Cardiff offices for 300 of the 900 staff.
Initially staff decided to strike for 24 hours, but they have accused the
Royal Mail of refusing to enter serious negotiations, and have agreed to
continue the dispute indefinitely.
Over the past 18 months the Royal Mail has been introducing 'settled
attendances' at its sorting offices throughout the UK. Many of the 140,000
Post Office staff - including three quarters of staff in south Wales -
accepted the new system after local consultation, although there have been a
number of disputes over its introduction, notably at Melton Mowbray in
Leicestershire and at Chester.
Under the Royal Mail's traditional working patterns, postal workers are
rotated between early, later and evening work shifts and between areas such
as sorting, distribution and delivery.
The new working practices involve specialist work teams who will develop
staff skills in specific areas and so end job mobility.
The Post Office's south Wales headquarters said yesterday that 80 per cent
of the staff involved would get the shifts and duties they preferred. It
added: 'The new scheme is designed to improve the quality of the service we
provide. It encourages staff to become experts in their own field.'
Mr Les Parry, a member of the UCW executive, said yesterday: 'We are not
against people having fixed duties. But the new system must be introduced
with their consent.'
The Post Office said it remains ready to deal with problems flexibly by
trying to ensure that unpopular shifts are made more attractive. It said
that no one would lose their job under the new system, and that basic pay
would not be affected.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Cutting drugs bill 'hits the wrong target'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prices of prescription drugs are rising less quickly than other costs in
the National Health Service, the Association of British Pharmaceutical
Industries said yesterday.
The pharmaceutical industry is opposing attempts by the government to reduce
the NHS's annual drugs bill - now about Pounds 2.3bn in England alone - by
measures including extending the limited list which restricts certain drugs
that doctors can prescribe.
Dr John Griffin, association director, yesterday accused the government of
'hitting the wrong target' by its efforts to cut prescribing costs.
'How can the government justify further cutbacks on medicines when other
costs in the NHS are so much greater?' he said. 'They should be supporting
better public health by increasing use of medicines rather than waiting for
patients to end up as expensive hospital cases.'
Dr Griffin, presenting the association's annual report, said drug-price
inflation was 2.5 per cent last year, compared with 8.5 per cent in the rest
of the NHS.
Drug prices have fallen by 15 per cent in real terms over the past 10 years,
the association said. Total spending on drugs remained less than 10 per cent
of the total NHS bill.
The list is intended to cut costs, but, Dr Griffin said, it 'would mean
British patients getting older, cheaper medicines rather than the best and
would delay or deter the search for (new) medicines'.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has taken a strong stand on the
need to control drug costs. She has said she cannot justify forcing NHS
employees to accept pay increases limited to 1.5 per cent while the drugs
bill is rising by many times that amount.
The Department of Health is one of the Whitehall departments being surveyed
for savings under the government's review of public spending.
The association also produced the results of a survey of general
practitioners yesterday that showed 72 per cent of respondents wanted the
government to withdraw the limited list of drugs.
Some 75 per cent of GPs thought the list would affect drugs research - new
treatments might find it difficult to join the limited list.
The survey also found that 49 per cent of MPs, including 20 per cent of
Conservative MPs, wanted the government to withdraw the limited list.
The association claims that research in the British pharmaceuticals industry
could be put at risk by the government's policies on prescribing. Its annual
report points out that one fifth of all investment in research and
development in Britain - Pounds 4m a day - is spent by pharmaceuticals
companies.
Dr Griffin called on the government to recognise that its Health of the
Nation programme to improve overall health standards would need increased
resources.

JOB prospects for school leavers are 'very grim', Mr Frank Dobson, shadow
employment secretary, said yesterday, David Owen writes.
Launching a Labour survey on youth unemployment, Mr Dobson warned that this
year's 16 to 19-year-olds could become 'a lost generation'.
He added that unemployment among 18 and 19-year-olds had almost doubled in
the three years to April.
The Department of Employment said prospects for young people were better
this year as the economy and the labour market were picking up.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Argus Press deal referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY INTERNATIONAL'S proposed Pounds 23m purchase of the 26 local
newspapers owned by Argus Press was yesterday referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
A reference by the Department of Trade and Industry is automatic under fair
trading legislation if the deal involves average paid-for circulation of
500,000 or more on day of publication, unless the business is not viable.
Chester-based Trinity, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and the Echo,
has been expanding aggressively in the local and regional newspaper market.
The company, which owns newspapers in north-west England, north Wales,
Canada and the US, last year bought Scottish and Universal Newspapers from
Lonrho in a Pounds 45m deal. Since the Argus agreement Trinity has made a
Pounds 12.6m recommended cash offer for the Huddersfield Daily Examiner.
Although the Argus deal will increase Trinity's presence in the local
newspaper market it is likely that it will receive MMC approval.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Council acquires listed hotel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH PEAK Borough Council in Derbyshire has bought the Georgian Grade I
listed St Anne's Hotel, in Buxton Crescent, Buxton, and English Heritage is
to provide Pounds 1m for roof and stonework repairs.
The crescent was built between 1779 and 1789 for the fifth Duke of
Devonshire, who intended its buildings to form a leisure complex and
lodgings for a new spa which he hoped would rival Bath.
St Anne's Hotel deteriorated over the years and was closed in 1989 because
of breaches of hygiene regulations. The owners sold it, unable to afford the
repairs.
The structure continued to deteriorate further, and in 1990 gales badly
damaged the roof.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund has taken the unusual step of giving the
council a grant to cover the hotel's Pounds 180,000 purchase price.
The National Heritage Department said yesterday that this was in recognition
of the importance of the building and to arrest its accelerating
deterioration.
Last December the National Heritage Department issued a notice demanding
that Capitalrise, then the hotel's owner, carry out extensive repairs to the
roof and masonry and eliminate wet and dry rot.
In April the government served a compulsory purchase order on Capitalrise,
on the grounds of 'lack of any significant progress'. It was thought to be
the first time a CPO had been served by the secretary of state to protect a
listed building, rather than by a local planning authority.
A report recommending future uses for the building by English Heritage, the
borough council and the county council, which owns the rest of the crescent,
is now under consideration.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Chambers warn against complacency despite recovery signs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH evidence that Britain is slowly climbing out of recession came from
economic survey results yesterday.
Yet there were also indications of increasing insolvencies among
manufacturing companies, prompting the British Chambers of Commerce to warn
the government against complacency.
'Insolvency levels are still too high,' said Mr Richard Brown, deputy
director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, which yesterday
published the latest quarterly insolvency figures on behalf of the
Department of Trade and Industry.
'The government should not be too complacent,' added Mr Brown. 'There has to
be concern over the persistent shrinkage of the UK's manufacturing base.'
A total of 5,195 companies collapsed in April, May and June, a reduction of
8.9 per cent on the 5,705 insolvencies recorded in the first quarter and a
recent peak of 6,999 in the third quarter of last year, the BCC figures
show.
Sectors such as metals, engineering, textiles and clothing are suffering
disproportionately. A total of 1,149 manufacturing companies failed in the
first quarter of this year - the last date for which more detailed sectoral
figures are available - compared with 1,420 in last year's fourth quarter.
Mr Brown said many capital-intensive companies were suffering as a result of
low levels of investment in recent years.
The number of individuals who went bankrupt fell sharply by 15.3 per cent
between the first two quarters of this year - from 10,233 to 8,663. The
latter figure, however, was only 1.9 per cent below that for the
corresponding period last year.
Mr Brown said falling levels of insolvencies were good for business,
employee and consumer confidence. He said: 'This has got be good news. If
fewer people are being made bankrupt this has got to have a knock-on
effect.'
He added: 'This third consecutive quarterly fall in the number of corporate
insolvencies provides further evidence that recovery is under way.'
A survey by Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company, also
provided evidence of recovery.
The number of companies working at less than 50 per cent capacity fell to 27
per cent of the sample of more than 500 companies, compared with 31 per cent
in the first quarter. The proportion working 'flat out' rose to 16 per cent
from 10 per cent.
During the first three months of this year payments to companies were on
average 24 days late, compared with 25 and 26 days respectively in the two
previous quarters.
Exporters face much longer delays in receiving payment. The number of
companies being paid on time shrank from 19 per cent of Trade Indemnity's
sample in the first quarter to 9 per cent in the second quarter.
The company said: 'Constant vigilance on export debtors is still essential
while recessionary conditions persist in Europe and Japan.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / Staff muck in to support Scotland's forgotten airport: There
are no passengers, but Prestwick insists it has a future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE 400,000 people who live in Ayrshire have one thing in common it is a
passionate loyalty to Prestwick Airport.
There is a widespread belief that the airport, near Ayr on the Firth of
Clyde, is one of the world's finest. It has a long runway, an impressive
passenger terminal and the area's mild climate means it is hardly ever
forced to close.
Yet for the past year and a half it has had no regular passenger flights,
scheduled or charter. Much of the terminal is deserted. Even Mr Matthew
Hudson, the airport's chief executive, jokes: 'Business? We haven't got any
business.'
Prestwick's decline accelerated in 1990 when the government abolished the
legal requirement for transatlantic flights from Scotland to use Prestwick.
The number of flights using the airport was already dwindling: passengers
were reluctant to use it because, being 30 miles south-west of Glasgow, it
was seen as too remote for much of Scotland. As soon as transatlantic
flights were free to use Glasgow, services to north America were launched
from there.
Prestwick's monopoly had been maintained because of the influence wielded by
Ayrshire MPs, led by Mr George Younger, who was Tory MP for Ayr and is now
Lord Younger of Prestwick.
Now Ayrshire is having to prove its loyalty to Prestwick with money and hard
work.
In April last year the airport was bought from BAA, the airports operator,
by a consortium of Ayrshire business people and local authorities, chaired
by Lord Younger. It now belongs to PIK Holdings, a company named after
Prestwick's international call-sign.
Although there are no passenger flights, Prestwick has substantial air
freight business. Federal Express, the US freight company, operates daily
services and has taken a 10 per cent stake in PIK. Air Canada and TNT also
use the freight terminal.
The airport is used by British Aerospace which builds aircraft at Prestwick
and owns the runway. Its pilot training college can generate hundreds of
daily air movements by trainer aircraft.
Ryder Systems, the US company, has a plant adjoining the airport that
overhauls aero-engines. The airport is used by Bond Helicopters. There is
also a naval air station, HMS Gannet, whose previous commander Mr Paddy
Healey left the Navy to become PIK's managing director. But that is about
all.
Mr Hudson, a Canadian lawyer who moved to Ayrshire, says: 'We've had to
reinvent the way an airport is managed. What we've done enables us to
survive and be profitable at a very low level of turnover.'
New working practices were brought in. PIK made all 71 BAA employees
redundant and built up a new workforce, re-hiring some of the former staff
and engaging new ones on different conditions. The number of unions was cut
from about eight to one. All 137 staff have to be able to perform at least
two jobs.
'The crash rescue team works on the apron, shifts luggage when necessary or
cuts the grass,' says Mr Hudson. 'My secretary sometimes goes and works in
the duty-free store when aircrew want to purchase anything.'
Instead of contracting out handling and other services, PIK has taken over
everything itself. 'We do all freight and passenger handling,' says Mr
Hudson. PIK has taken over air traffic control from a Civil Aviation
Authority subsidiary, and runs its own duty-free sales.
Holiday flights from Prestwick should start again next year. The tour
company Direct Holidays is to operate flights to destinations including
Florida, Turkey and the Algarve. PIK has also set up its own travel agency.
Prestwick believes it can compete successfully with Glasgow because it
charges airlines Pounds 15 less a passenger, due in part to its
cost-reduction programme. It can also offer much cheaper carparking for
travellers than Glasgow. 'We want to make Prestwick into Scotland's
favourite holiday airport,' says Mr Hudson.
Now that Ayrshire has to take responsibility for Prestwick the community is
pulling all the stops out.
One of the airport's long-standing weaknesses is that although the
Glasgow-Ayr railway passes little more than 100 yards from the terminal,
there is no railway station.
Now a station is likely to be built at a cost of Pounds 2m, financed with
help from Strathclyde Regional Council and Kyle and Carrick District
Council, which is already a shareholder in PIK.
British Rail is also expected to agree to a scheme giving free rail travel
to the airport to rail travellers from anywhere in Scotland who display a
ticket for a Prestwick flight.
Mr Hudson explains that BAA had no motivation to promote Prestwick because
it owned Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. He believes BAA normally made
annual operating losses of about Pounds 3m at Prestwick.
PIK says it made a profit in its first year of operations. 'The accounts are
not yet audited, but we should make pre-tax profits of between Pounds
600,000 to Pounds 800,000 for the year to March 31 on turnover of about
Pounds 4.5m,' says Mr Hudson.
'We made a profit in the first half and have already handed out Pounds 250
to each of our staff in profit-related pay,' he adds. 'This is a community
endeavour.'
Even sceptics believe that whatever the next few years hold for Prestwick,
the airport's long-term survival is assured.
A politician involved with the airport explains: 'It will be politically
impossible ever to build a new runway at Glasgow. So when Glasgow eventually
runs out of space, Prestwick will come into its own.'

FT  07 AUG 93 / Pupil staying-on rate lags competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALLER proportion of those aged 16 to 18 stay in full-time education in
the UK than in any of its leading industrial competitors, the Department for
Education said yesterday.
The department's figures compare participation in education in eight
European Community countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Japan, Sweden
and the US. They show that full-time participation by 16 to 18-year-olds as
a whole is only 40 per cent in the UK, while the rate for other countries
varies from 47 per cent in Italy, where the school-leaving age is 14, to 89
per cent in Germany.
Earlier this week Sir Ron Dearing - who heads the government's review of the
national curriculum - announced that he was to consult on introducing more
vocational education for 14-year-olds in an attempt to encourage children to
stay in training for longer. He pointed out that in France, Germany and the
Netherlands, more than 25 per cent of children above the age of 14 go to
schools specialising in vocational education.
The latest figures are likely to add impetus to Sir Ron's call for reform,
which was endorsed by both employers and teaching unions.
Full-time participation by 16-year-olds in the UK is only 57 per cent - only
Italy has a lower rate, with 54 per cent. Canada has the highest rate at 100
per cent and Germany has a rate of 99 per cent.
The UK has the highest participation in part-time education - such as
evening courses and training courses with employers - at 31 per cent. Once
part-time education is included, the UK has a total participation rate of 71
per cent, ahead of Italy (65 per cent), Spain (61 per cent), and Australia
(69 per cent).
The data shows that the total staying-on rate in the UK improved by 6
percentage points from 65 per cent in 1982 to 71 per cent in 1990. Yet
stronger improvements were registered by France, up 16 percentage points,
and Spain and Belgium (14 points).
Rates of participation increased more for women than for men in every
country except Spain.
All countries saw staying-on rates decline each year after the age of 16.
This effect is most marked in the UK, where only 23 per cent of 18-year-olds
stay in full-time education. In Germany the figure is 80 per cent, while
none of the other EC countries surveyed has a rate of less than 41 per cent.
According to the department, the UK's staying-on rate has improved by about
10 percentage points since 1990. This is partly due to the 5 per cent fall
in the number in this age group.
Labour said that high unemployment had also encouraged children who would
prefer to look for a job to stay in school. The department attributes the
rise in staying-on to new vocational qualifications.

COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, has been appointed by the
Department of the Environment to study how compulsory competitive tendering
can be introduced to local-authority white-collar services.
Competitive tendering is already compulsory for a range of manual services,
but is yet to be introduced for legal services and 'construction-related
services' such as quantity surveying and architecture. Security guards at
the Sheffield offices of the Department of Employment are to strike from
Monday as part of the NUCPS Civil Service union's dispute over market

THE CENTRAL Statistical Office announced yesterday that it was altering its
volume, or constant price, series which are at present based on 1985.
Index numbers in future will equal 100 in 1990 rather than in 1985 so series
expressed at constant prices will have their levels changed.
The CSO also said that it was changing the definition of manufacturing. It
will now include coke ovens, mineral oil processing and nuclear fuel
production. These industries were previously classified as energy
industries.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Lib Dems gain 19 seats by targeting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats have made a net gain of 19 seats in the 183 local
authority by-elections that have been held since the county council
elections at the beginning of May.
According to the Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre at the
University of Plymouth this is the result of successful targeting of
resources at promising seats by the Liberal Democrats, and could be
translated into future gains of parliamentary seats.
Mr Collin Rallings and Mr Michael Thrasher, from the university, pointed out
that the Liberal Democrats had gained four seats in the south-west in last
year's general election, even though their share of the national vote fell
by 4.5 per cent.
Writing in Local Government Chronicle, they concluded: 'Unless the Tories
manage to increase their vote at the next election, they are likely to lose
at least a handful of seats to the Liberal Democrats in southern England.'
Thirteen of the 19 gains were from the Conservatives, with four from Labour
and two from others.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Souvenir hunters lift Nadir sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUVENIR hunters were out in force yesterday as the personal belongings of
Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, were auctioned.
The sale of contents of Mr Nadir's London home in Eaton Place, Belgravia,
brought in a total of Pounds 73,309 - three times more than the bankruptcy
trustees had expected.
Christies, the London auction house, had predicted that the sale would
realise up to Pounds 30,000 with its combination of 19th-century fine art
and 1990s kitchenware.
The highest price was paid for a set of eight Turkish military portraits. An
anonymous buyer from Istanbul bid Pounds 9,900.
Most lots were more modest. Four scatter cushions embroidered AN were
purchased for Pounds 38.50. Also for sale were two washing machines, a hair
dryer and an electric kettle. A selection of video tapes which sold for
Pounds 77 included the titles The Wrong Arm of the Law, and Lock Up,
Sylvestor Stallone's prison film.
Mr Mark Simmons, an advertising executive, said he had come to the sale out
of curiosity and because he needed a television. Mr Nadir's home contained
several televisions, three of them bought by Mr Simmons for Pounds 83. There
was fiercer competition for Mr Nadir's hi-fi system, which finally sold for
Pounds 935.
The last item of the sale was a gold watch, the confiscation of which
prompted MP Mr Michael Mates to send a replacement, famously inscribed:
'Don't let the buggers get you down'. Mr Mates's watch cost Pounds 20. The
original sold yesterday for Pounds 1,540.
Mr Michael Bowkett, a City scaffolding contractor, paid Pounds 418 for Mr
Nadir's gold Jean D'Eve 'Sectora' dress watch with a dedication from his son
Birol: 'To Dad, happy birthday, time flies, always use it to the full. Love
you very much.' Mr Bowkett said: 'I thought it would be nice to have
something of Nadir's'
Mr Kareem Osmani, a private investigator, paid Pounds 88 for one lot which
included an engraved hip flask, ash trays and cigars. He described the hip
flask as 'a nice novelty'.
Mr Ramadan Shekerzade, of Haringey, north London, became the proud owner of
Mr Nadir's books, which included Asil Nadir and the Rise and Fall of Polly
Peck. He said: 'My relatives worked for him in Cyprus. My parents have land
next to him.'
Mr Nadir's bankruptcy trustees said they were very pleased with the sale.
The auctioneer, Mr Jim Collingridge, deputy chairman at Christies, said
afterwards: 'There were a lot of strange bids, a lot of people not used to
salerooms, but the prices were tremendous. Some things were silly money
compared to what you can normally buy on these occasions.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE relationship between doctors and patients should not be based on
commercial factors, the British Medical Association yesterday told a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into private medical fees.
Last month the commission reached a preliminary conclusion that the way
consultants set fees in relation to guidelines produced by the BMA and
leading medical insurers formed a complex monopoly.
In its response yesterday the BMA argued that an 'orderly arrangement', with
fees set within a generally accepted and published range, should be
fostered. The existence of guidelines provided a way of stimulating
discussion about fees and helped prevent excessive charges.

<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government yesterday dropped the remaining 15 fraud and
corruption charges against a former Malaysian banker who is serving a
one-year sentence for his role in one of Hong Kong's biggest corruption
scandals, AP reports from Hong Kong.
Lorrain Esme Osman, 62, the former chairman of the now defunct Bumiputra
Malaysia Finance, was sentenced to a year in jail by the High Court in June
after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud.
He was brought back to Hong Kong from London last year after a seven-year
extradition battle that made him the longest-serving unconvicted prisoner in
Britain.
Mr Osman was accused of approving millions of dollars in unsecured loans
between 1979 and 1983 to the Carrian group of companies, a high-flying
property and shipping conglomerate that collapsed in 1983, leaving debts of
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 805m).
Prosecutors said the largest loan totalled Dollars 292m.
Carrian's chairman, Mr George Tan, is on bail of HKDollars 50m (Pounds 4m)
awaiting trial.
With good behaviour and time already spent in prison, Mr Osman could be
released this month.

CHINESE firefighters early yesterday extinguished blazes triggered by a
chain of massive industrial explosions in the southern city of Shenzhen,
Reuter reports.
A local government spokesman said seven bodies had so far been recovered
following Thursday's disaster. It was not known how many people were
missing.
The semi-official China News Service quoted spokesman Huang Xinhua as saying
137 people had been admitted to hospital and that as many as 70 people could
have been killed.
Witnesses likened the explosion to an atomic bomb's mushroom cloud and said
it could be seen on the northern fringes of Hong Kong just across the border
from Shenzhen.
Fires from an initial chemical blast at the Anmao Dangerous Goods Shipping
and Storage Company in Qingshuihe, north of Shenzhen city centre, ignited
warehouses storing inflammable goods. There were seven minor blasts between
the two major explosions at the plant, which is run by the Chinese military,
and the blaze took more than 10 hours to control.
Thousands of residents were evacuated. An investigation has been launched
into the cause of the blast, a spokesman said.

FT  07 AUG 93 / 'Iron Butterfly' flutters aloft as political landscape is
reshaped: Former Socialist leader becomes first woman Speaker of the Diet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FROM HER elevated position in the Japanese parliament building, Ms Takako
Doi, the 'Iron Butterfly', yesterday became the first woman to look down
upon her peers from the velvet covered seat.
Although she initially rejected the job of Speaker of the Diet - the lower
house of parliament - she assumed the post in serious vein, naming the
country's new prime minister with her booming voice.
It has been a long week for the 64-year-old former leader of the Social
Democratic party, previously known as the Japan Socialist party.
Her supporters had hoped she would refuse the offer of the Speaker's post.
They had suggested she form a new party along with the left-wing faction of
the SDP.
Left-wing members have been unhappy at the SDP's decision to enter a
coalition government with former members of the Liberal Democratic party -
the establishment party now edged out of power after dominating Japan's
postwar politics.
Ms Doi's own left-wing leanings, including support for the North Korean
regime and opposition to Japan's defence forces, were blamed for the
unexpected defeat of the SDP in the Tokyo gubernatorial elections two years
ago, after which she resigned as party leader.
But even though she stepped down from the top job, Ms Doi has maintained her
personal popularity as a politician and retains the charisma which once awed
the LDP.
Leaders of the present coalition were worried that she and a band of
left-wing members might splinter from the SDP and so reduce the coalition's
majority in parliament.
Since Speakers of the Diet are expected to give up party membership during
their tenure, leftists in the SDP have accused party officials of trying to
get rid of 'true socialist' ideologies by promoting Ms Doi.
After days during which SDP officials pressed her to take the offer, Ms Doi
finally relented.
She had resisted on the grounds that the party with the largest number of
seats in the Diet should nominate the Speaker. But she eventually accepted
the post, she said, to 'prevent democracy from collapsing' and hoped to make
the political process more open and less corrupt.
The daughter of a doctor in Kobe, western Japan, Ms Doi became a professor
of constitutional law before being elected to the Diet in 1969.
Coalition leaders said her constitutional law background was perfect for the
post of Speaker.
Her popularity stems from her down-to-earth image. She plays pachinko, the
Japanese version of pinball, loves karaoke and is an avid fan of baseball.
She is also respected for her outspoken ways. Unlike some of her peers, who
are renowned for their evasive answers, she is not afraid to call a spade a
spade.
Some politicians fear that such straightforwardness could stand in the way
of her new job, which often requires delicate handling of parliamentary
proceedings.
However, Ms Doi has made clear that she will not follow tradition, but will
go about her business the 'natural way'.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Japan's bureaucrats fear new division of labour: Officials
are concerned the new coalition will usurp their role as policy formers

<TEXT>
IN Kasumigaseki, the district in central Tokyo where Japan's ministries are
concentrated, brave assurances from bureaucrats that it will be business as
usual are pitted against concern that the cosy relationship they have
enjoyed with politicians for nearly 40 years is over.
Business leaders, meanwhile, appear unable to keep up with the swift changes
in the political landscape. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the leading
industrial association, Keidanren, the largest employers' federation,
continues to express support for the outgoing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
even after it lost its majority in the lower house in the national election
last month.
Although Mr Hiraiwa belatedly expressed his respect for Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, for his enthusiasm in reforming Japanese
politics, the business establishment has not been able to hide its concern
that the crumbling of the old order robs it of its raison d'etre.
The bureaucrats' concern centres on the possibility that the fundamental
division of labour between politicians and the bureaucracy may be coming to
an end.
Under the LDP, politicians were more or less happy to let bureaucrats form
policy in consultation with industry. Once they had decided on a policy line
they would lobby the necessary LDP politicians whose role was to ensure that
the policy was legislated.
The system functioned on a cosy triangular relationship in which industry
provided bureaucrats with comfortable jobs when they retired in exchange for
advancing their interests, while politicians provided the assurance that
those policies would be legislated in exchange for votes. The collapse of
this relationship between bureaucrats, industry and politicians means that
policy is likely to be more openly debated.
But bureaucrats fear there could be a shift in the relationship and that
politicians will increasingly usurp their role as policy formers.
Unlike LDP politicians, the relatively young members of the Japan New party
or the New Harbinger party are not dependent on industry groups for votes
and are unlikely to be as susceptible to lobbying by the bureaucrats.
Depending on the assertiveness of a new cabinet minister, the role of
bureaucrats could be reduced to making proposals rather than forming policy.
In the past it has been largely up to the bureaucrats to decide on policy
matters, with the LDP merely rubber-stamping their actions. Lobbying will
become much more difficult.
The large number of coalition members who will need convincing about
particular policy decisions will in itself complicate communication with
politicians, bureaucrats fear. This could lead to long delays in the
implementation of policies.
Life is also likely to become more difficult for bureaucrats involved in
policy matters which coalition members have publicly opposed. The SDP, for
example, has made opposition to the 3 per cent consumption tax introduced in
1989 a party platform. It also opposes nuclear energy, the military's
participation in the UN's peacekeeping operations and a proposed reform of
the national pension scheme, making bureaucrats tremble at the thought of
finding themselves under a minister from that particular party.
However, not all bureaucrats are worried that life under the new government
will differ much from life with the LDP.
Decisions will be collective, as they always have been, and important issues
will still involve politicians, bureaucrats, the media and the industries
concerned, says one bureaucrat. Key members of the coalition are former LDP
members with whom bureaucrats have had close ties. The ministries are also
counting on the links they have formed with the main opposition parties,
such as the SDP, which is now the largest group in the coalition.
'A lot of the relationships that were developed with the LDP were also
developed with the opposition,' says one trade ministry official. 'Most of
the legislation proposed by the Miti (Ministry of International Trade and
Industry) has been passed unanimously with the exception of the Communist
party.'
Mr Taiichi Sakaiya, a novelist and commentator who began his career at Miti,
points out that the SDP has not been as free from bureaucratic influence as
it might first seem.
'Politicians are, as it were, the subcontractors of the bureaucrats,' Mr
Sakaiya wrote in a recent column in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading
national newspaper. 'The opposition parties, such as the SDP, are not
unaffected by this relationship. (They) always oppose budget proposals but
when they are subject to lobbying by the ministries they suddenly give up
their resistance.' Some bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance hope the
influence of policy group members who act as advisers to the ministries will
be reduced, making way for much-needed changes in funding priorities.
Business leaders are also uncertain about life under the new government. On
the surface, most business leaders express optimism that the new government
will introduce reforms in the relationship between politics and business.
The practice of collecting political donations through the Keidanren, for
example, which puts pressure on businesses to donate funds has been widely
criticised.
But beneath their seemingly calm acceptance of the changes they face,
business leaders are having to identify a new role. Keidanren, in
particular, whose influence over the LDP stemmed from its huge political
donations to the party, cannot easily switch loyalties, while its role as a
channel for political funds could be removed if the practice is reformed.
While bureaucrats and businessmen contemplate the long-term implications of
working with a coalition government, they face the short term difficulty of
not knowing where to concentrate their loyalties.
A poll taken by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper showed that 54 per cent
of bureaucrats surveyed believed there would be another election in any case
early next year. Given that the new coalition government might not last
long, bureaucrats are wary of focusing their lobbying efforts on politicians
who may be in office only for the next few months.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW THE COALITION BREAKS DOWN. . .AND WHY IT COULD BREAK UP
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Sadao Yamahana
70 seats
Traditional party of opposition, now thrust into government for the
  first time since 1947-48 to the discomfort of leftist ideologues in
  its ranks who would prefer to be called, as it still is in Japanese,
  the Japan Socialist Party.
Largest group in the coalition in spite of being the biggest loser in
  the election, with its Diet representation almost halved and at its
  lowest ever.
Has moderated its stance in recent years but remains out of step with
  its new partners on almost every issue. Beholden to interests of
  public sector unions on administrative reforms and of farmers on rice
  imports. Anti-nuclear and pacifist, distrusts Washington and shuns
  Seoul.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN RENEWAL PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Tsutomu Hata
55 seats
Set up in June be defectors who brought down the ruling Liberal
  Democratic party in a no-confidence motion because of its failure to
  enact political reform.
Ex-finance minister Hata has been moving towards the centre but
  co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP powerbroker, plays a more
  shadowy role.
In contrast to the SDP, the JRP is conservative on defence issues and
  has indicated the need for value added tax to be increased -
  consumption tax in Japan is currently levied at only 3 per cent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAN GOVERNMENT PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Koshiro Ishida
51 seats
Linked to the Buddhist Doka Gakkai movement, the source of much of its
  money, but is formally independent.
In the 30 years of its life has had consistent electoral support of
  around 10 per cent, and added seats this time in spite of the
  plethora of new parties from which to choose.
Has both pro-military and pacifist elements within its ranks, and
  many policies are nebulous.
Open to a full merger of coalition forces to create a two-party
  system. Leader Ishida is said to be close to JRP's Ozawa.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN NEW PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Morihiro Hosokawa
35 seats
The new prime minister founded his party in mid-1992 out of disgust
  with the stasis engendered by the bureaucracy and its cosy, often
  corrupt links with big business and politicians in the LDP, of which
  he was formerly a member.
Wants more power devolved to Japan's regions, and will be conscious of
  Japan's image abroad. Intitally called for a liberalisation of the
  country's closed market for rice but has backed away in the face of
  resistance from other coalition members.
Nearly all its Diet members are first-timers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Keigo Ouchi
15 seats
Offshoot of the Socialists in 1960 which gravitated towards the LDP
  but shied away from its corrupt image this time.
Had suggested immediately after the election that it might still join
  LDP in alternative coalition, and its loyalty to new ruling may be
  suspect.
Funded largely by private sector unions, and is keen on administrative
  reform.
Policies lack clarity but tend to be conservative, particulary of
  defence.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW HARBINGER PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Masayoshi Takemura
13 seats
Another LDP splinter group which sheared off this June and gained a net
  three seats in the election.
Has bonded increasingly closely with the JNP, and the two may merge.
Both are wary of the strength in the coalition wielded by the JRP,
  particularly the Ozawa influence. NHP has urged establishing a
  coalition consensus on economic, defence and foreign policy,
  recognising that a government will have to deal with these as well as
  political reform, however short its life.
Open about need to increase indirect taxation.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Party leader: Satsuki Eda
4 seats
Has sought to grow by poaching reformists from the SDP, some members
  of which have linked with Eda and allies in a political study group.
Other members now lean towards the JNP and NHP, and party may urge
  a unification of all seven.
Too small to trouble the overall arithmetic of the coalition unless
  other walk out.
Leader Eda is suspicious of Ozawa's LDP past.

<TEXT>
MR WARREN CHRISTOPHER, US secretary of state, completed his Middle East
shuttle yesterday, declaring he had salvaged the Arab-Israeli peace process
and made more progress during the trip than he expected. Israel, Lebanon and
Syria endorsed Mr Christopher's optimistic assessment of his trip.
However, in a sign of the continuing risks of violence in the region,
Palestinian militants killed three Israeli soldiers in the occupied West
Bank and Lebanese guerrillas pounded Israel's allies in southern Lebanon,
drawing retaliatory fire from Israeli artillery.
Mr Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defence minister, said Palestinian
militants were trying to sabotage the peace process and hitting back for
Israel's fierce bombardment of Lebanese civilians last week.
In Lebanon pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas fired 30 Katyusha rockets,
Sagger anti-tank missiles and mortars into positions of the South Lebanon
Army, Israel's proxy force operating in its self-declared security zone. The
attacks, not covered by a ceasefire brokered by Mr Christopher last week,
drew Israeli shells and tank rounds at villages, sending civilians fleeing
for a second time in two weeks.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Liberian children 'facing starvation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE lives of 7,000 malnourished Liberian children are in jeopardy unless
access for relief supplies from neighbouring Ivory Coast is reinstated, the
London-based charity Save the Children warned yesterday.
The country's peace plan, which calls for supervision of road traffic to
prevent gun-running to civil war factions, is blocking relief supplies to
areas where people are starving. The United Nations has told Ivory Coast
authorities shipments of food and medicine to rebel territory must wait -
apparently until UN inspectors arrive to monitor traffic and prevent
shipments of arms to the rival factions.
Mr Nicholas Hinton, director general of Save the Children, called on the UN
'to act immediately to put observers in place on the border. . . It seems
utterly bizarre, and is a matter for deep concern, that children's lives
should be threatened at the very time when they were hoping for the benefits
of peace.'
Aid agencies, including the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, were
told by Ivory Coast last weekend they could not cross the border into parts
of Liberia held by rebel leader Charles Taylor. UN agencies and private
relief organisations say at least 250,000 people are in danger of starvation
in central and northern Liberia.
The International Red Cross estimates hundreds of children are dying every
week in areas controlled by Mr Taylor.
Under an agreement signed on July 25 to end Liberia's 3 1/2 -year-old civil
war, all factions are to be disarmed and confined to rehabilitation camps by
an expanded Ecomog West African military force, under the supervision of a
UN observer mission.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Civilian groups plan 3-day protest in Lagos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRO-DEMOCRACY groups in Lagos yesterday pressed ahead with plans for three
days of civilian protest in Nigeria's commercial capital next week calling
for an end to military rule.
The protests, set for August 12 to 14, were 'to demonstrate the implacable
commitment of the Nigerian people to the unconditional termination of
military rule on August 27,' the Campaign for Democracy (CD) pressure group
said.
Okesuna market in central Lagos was packed with people who said they were
buying essential items to stock up in case the protests choked Lagos as
similar ones did in July.
The government of President Ibrahim Babangida and civilian politicians face
a difficult task to overcome public hostility in Lagos and in the south-west
of Nigeria, stronghold of Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of June's annulled
presidential election to a proposed interim government.
Delegates from the military government and the two civilian political
parties have recommended to General Babangida that the next head of state
and his deputy should be civilians, with cabinet posts going to the service
chiefs of the armed forces.
The interim government would hold presidential elections in October 1994 and
hand over at the end of next year. The members of the new government would
be chosen from the Social Democratic Party and the National Republican
Convention and from non-party civilians. It is not clear who would choose
the new government nor whether it would have a free rein.
The SDP is split over the recommendations, with supporters of the
presidential candidate, Mr Abiola, denouncing it as a sell-out and community
leaders in Lagos calling for Mr Abiola to be installed as president. Mr
Abiola is pressing his case in the US, having met British government
ministers on Thursday.
The SDP chairman, Mr Tony Anenih, justified the interim government as the
only way to get the military out of power. 'If we reject it, we are
indirectly telling Babangida to stay on and Nigerians do not want that,' he
said after the recommendations were submitted to the president in Abuja.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Exiled Tibetan government in 'cordial' talks with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tibetan government-in-exile, headed by the Dalai Lama, has held 'frank
and cordial' talks in Beijing with the Chinese government, according to a
statement from its office in London yesterday.
It said Mr Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama's elder brother, and Mr Sonam
Topgyal, political affairs secretary of the India-based government, had met
ministers and senior officials of China's United Front Department, which
deals with Tibetan issues.
A Tibetan spokesman in London said that although Mr Thondup had visited
China on a number of occasions as the Dalai Lama's personal emissary, this
was the first time since 1984 that he had done so as a representative of the
exiled government. He is minister for security.
Experts on Tibet were surprised both at the issue of a statement - talks are
usually held in secret - and at its positive tone, though they were wary of
interpreting it as a sign of a breakthrough in relations between the Dalai
Lama and Beijing.
China's policy has been that anything could be discussed with the Dalai Lama
except Tibet's independence. The Dalai Lama implicitly accepted this when he
called, during a visit to London in May, for a 'one country, two systems'
approach.
Beijing is under mounting pressure from the west to engage in talks with the
Tibetans. US President Bill Clinton, who met the Dalai Lama in April, made
renewal of China's most-favoured nation trade status conditional upon
improvements in human rights in Tibet.
Britain has called for talks without pre-conditions.
Yesterday's statement said the Tibetan delegation had presented a letter to
the Chinese leadership from the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government wanted
to maintain contact with him. The Chinese embassy in London said it had not
seen the Tibetan statement and had no comment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MISSISSIPPI jury has found two US companies, Westinghouse Electric and
Dresser Industries, and an Australian company, Colonial Sugar Refinery,
guilty of wrongfully distributing products containing asbestos, and ordered
them to pay damages and penalties that could total hundreds of millions of
dollars, Patrick Harverson writes from New York.
Another US company, Uniroyal, was also found guilty but will not be affected
by the verdict because it had already settled during the trial.
The jury in the four-month trial, which was a consolidation of 9,600
individual asbestos-exposure lawsuits, ruled in favour of plaintiffs who
claimed they suffered lung injuries from inhaling products containing
asbestos fibres. The four companies were held liable for intentionally and
maliciously distributing defective, asbestos-bearing products.
The jury will begin considering how much to award as punitive damages today.
The jury awarded damages of Dollars 9.26m (Pounds 6.2m) to just six
representative plaintiffs whose cases were part of the trial. Three other
representative plaintiffs were found not to be eligible for compensation.
Five smaller defendant companies named in the lawsuit were found not guilty.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Jump in German unemployment: Short-timers laid off over
holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST Germany's unemployment rate jumped from 7 to 7.5 per cent last month as
companies took advantage of summer breaks and vacations to lay off employees
working on short-time schedules.
The number of west Germans unemployed reached a seasonally adjusted 2.3m in
July, an increase of 159,000 over June. Nearly half a million more people
were unemployed last month than in July 1992.
The number of people on short-time work in the west decreased by 41.5 per
cent, from 879,191 people to just over a half a million, last month.
Short-time workers are defined as employees who stay on their companies'
payrolls but work less than the normal 38 hours per week. Part of their
salary is covered by the federal labour office.
'This shows that hidden unemployment in Germany is now increasingly turning
into real unemployment,' Mr Michael Fuchs, president of the German
Association of Wholesale Exporters, the BGA, said.
Economists have warned that unemployment statistics do not take account of
workers who remain on payrolls through short-time work or retraining
schemes. Many say this so-called 'second labour market' would considerably
boost the unemployment rate if the recession continued and these workers
were made redundant.
The number of workers in retraining programmes and job creation schemes also
dropped slightly in the west to 369,797, continuing its downward trend since
the beginning of the year.
Similar figures surfaced in east Germany, where the unemployment rate jumped
to 15.3 per cent, compared with 14.4 in the previous two months. An
additional 66,800 people were reported to be jobless, bringing total
unemployment to 1.16m.
The number of people on short-time work fell by 22.5 per cent to 155,331.
People in retraining programmes and job creation schemes also decreased by
more than 60,000 to 601,713.
The overall number of people leaving these schemes is likely to continue to
increase steadily this year after the federal labour office announced in
February it could no longer finance new programmes because of the widening
deficit between contributions from the employed and unemployment benefit
payments.
German inflation rose by 0.2 percentage points in July to 4.3 per cent
year-on-year, confirming provisional figures indicating a modest rise in the
cost of living due to high rents and service costs as well as an increase in
taxes on insurance premiums, introduced on July 1.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Swedes go to ground while summer days are long: Where is
everybody? Hugh Carnegy finds them returning from their holidays
</HEADLINE>

IF YOU have been wondering when your Swedish client will reply to your fax,
the chances are that next week will bring an answer.
All over the country, families will spend the weekend packing up the country
cottage, mooring the boat and heading reluctantly back to the city at the
end of another long annual break that is a traditional feature of Sweden's
short summer.
Despite the toughest recession for 50 years, which has seen the economy
shrink for three years in a row, and an almost incessant national debate
about how to sustain the country's cherished position as an industrial
force, the four- to five-week summer holiday remains entrenched. Many
companies still shut down production for the duration and government offices
are maintained on skeleton staffs. Tourists visiting Stockholm find to their
irritation that many restaurants close. It was not uncommon in July for
calls to senior executives and officials to be answered by a recorded
message or a security officer saying 'Ring back on August 9.'
Given that a large part of Sweden's problem has been a lack of industrial
competitiveness, the long holiday might seem an indulgence it can no longer
afford. But it does not appear to be under great threat. 'I don't think this
is a problem that should be exaggerated,' says an economist at SAF, the
employers' federation. 'After all, we can't have our holidays in August
instead of July, the Swedish climate doesn't function like that.'
Many Swedes also argue that the country has in any case been making striking
gains in competitiveness without abandoning the summer holiday. The strong
devaluation of the krona last August has helped produce a 20 per cent
improvement in Sweden's competitive position this year. Wage agreements have
also come down sharply. Absenteeism has been curbed by cuts in government
sick pay schemes. Tax reforms have seen basic corporate tax fall from 50 per
cent to 30 per cent.
Some holiday schedules have been altered. Trade unions at Saab, the car
maker, agreed to split this year's five-week break into three to avoid
disrupting the start of production of the company's new 900 model. At Volvo,
the four-week holiday was put back a week to overlap for at least one week
with holidays at Renault, its French partner.
According to SAF figures, Swedish hourly labour costs have fallen from
ranking second only to Germany last year to seventh this year in a
comparison with 13 western industrial countries. Sweden is now cheaper than
the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark, though 15 per cent more expensive than
France, about 20 per cent more expensive than Japan and the US and over 30
per cent more expensive than the UK.
Without the currency effect, the surviving features of the 'Swedish model'
would be more obvious. The overall tax burden in Sweden, for example, is
almost 60 per cent of GDP, compared with an EC average of just over 40 per
cent. Employers' contributions have been cut, but are still 31 per cent of
salary. Wage differentials remain narrow, making employment of young or
low-skilled people comparatively expensive.
There is much debate over the high cost of the country's generous child care
and maternity/paternity allowances. Currently, however, employers must allow
couples a total of one year off between them for the birth of a new child.
And then there are holidays. The basic statutory annual holiday entitlement
is about to be cut from 27 to 25 working days, on top of public holidays. In
practice, many people receive more. According to the Finance Ministry,
government workers get between 30 and 36 days, depending on their age.
Most is taken in July, before the days shorten again. Some officials and
businessmen say that if Sweden joins the EC, as it intends, holidays may
have to shift back to mesh more closely with the European pattern of August
holidays. For now, though, July is still for enjoying the precious long
days, never mind the recession.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Bosnia air strikes disarray
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALLIED threats to carry out air strikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia
were thrown into fresh confusion yesterday when General Francis Briquemont,
UN commander for Bosnia, strongly criticised the proposals.
Gen Briquemont warned in Sarajevo that the strikes would complicate the
situation on the ground and could endanger the lives of the UN troops in
Bosnia. His concern was echoed by Lord Owen, international mediator, who
said independent Nato action to lift the 16-month siege would destroy any
future co-operation between the UN and Nato.
'I am totally and absolutely opposed in the circumstances of Yugoslavia to
be trying to work outside the framework of the UN and the UN Security
Council and the secretary general,' Lord Owen said, adding that the threat
of air strikes had contributed to the breakdown of the Geneva peace talks
this week.
The criticism came as Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, met Mr
Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, at the Aviano allied air base in
Italy to discuss logistics for the air strikes.
After the talks Mr Christopher again threatened military action if the
Bosnian Serbs did not stop 'strangling' Sarajevo.
'The international community cannot accept the bombing of citizens and the
laying of siege to cities,' he said. He did not spell out what would be
sufficient to halt Nato strikes.
The Nato council of ambassadors is to meet in Brussels on Monday to finalise
the plans. Last Tuesday, it threatened to bomb Serb artillery positions
around Sarajevo if Bosnian Serbs did not lift their 'stranglehold' on the
city.
Logistical plans for the air strikes are being finalised at meetings of Nato
officers at allied military headquarters in Mons, Belgium, this weekend.
In an apparent attempt to defuse the allied threat and take the moral high
ground in the peace negotiations, Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday repeated
their offer to withdraw from two strategic mountains they seized this week.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has said he will not return to the
Geneva negotiations, scheduled to resume on Monday, unless the Serbs carry
out their promise to withdraw.
But after Gen Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb military commander, and Gen Rasim
Delic, head of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, met for talks at Sarajevo
airport on the Serb withdrawal from the two mountains, they failed to agree
on a handover of positions.
In Geneva, Lord Owen said he still hoped the peace negotiations would
restart on Monday, and re-presented a proposed constitution for tripartite
division of Bosnia. But he warned that although there had been progress over
a map for the country's ethnic division, negotiations over the future status
and division of Sarajevo were deadlocked.
'It remains the biggest obstacle,' he said, adding: 'There is not at the
moment any sight of agreement.' He said Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to
give Moslems 30 per cent of the land of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Echoing widespread allied concerns, the British Foreign Office said it would
push for the Nato meeting on Monday to consider the state of the peace
negotiations in Geneva before any plans for air strikes were formulated.
UN relief officials yesterday warned that Sarajevo, mostly without water and
electricity, this week would run out of fuel if aid routes were not open.

FT  07 AUG 93 / French still cautious on rapid interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France moved to ease money market interest rates yesterday, but
signalled its opposition to rapid interest rate cuts despite what was in
effect a flotation of the French franc last weekend.
Stock market investors shrugged off the cautious signal from the financial
authorities, pushing the CAC-40 index up by almost 1 per cent to 2,149, its
highest ever, in anticipation of reduced borrowing costs.
The central bank reopened its five-to-ten day borrowing facility, suspended
at the end of July to tighten liquidity as part of France's unsuccessful
attempt to thwart sustained attacks against the franc. The rate, available
to commercial banks, was re-introduced at 10 per cent, compared with the
rate of 7.75 per cent at which it was suspended.
The moves confirmed the government's cautious approach to reducing interest
rates, despite the widening of the fluctuation bands in the European
exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 to 15 per cent.
The stance has perplexed some economists who expected France to take
advantage of the weakening of the franc/ D-Mark link to cut borrowing costs
and help lift the economy from recession. They warned that an attempt to
keep the franc strong by maintaining high interest rates could be
self-defeating.
'If the currency markets feel that continued high interest rates are
damaging the prospects of French economic recovery, then the franc may come
under attack again,' said one economist in Paris. Yesterday the franc fell
by more than one centime against the D-Mark, to about FFr3.49.
France's cautious stance partly reflects political considerations. Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur has staked his credibility on a strong franc and
has said convergence between the French and German currencies remains the
objective of his government.
But some members of Mr Balladur's Gaullist RPR party are believed to favour
a quick cut in interest rates. Mr Alain Madelin, minister for small
business, who last December advocated a floating franc, said the easing of
franc/D-Mark links opened the way to interest rate cuts.
Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR leader, has also hinted that he favours interest rate
cuts as a means to reduce unemployment, forecast to reach 12.5 per cent by
the end of the year. Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly,
is also thought to be in favour of a rapid reduction in borrowing costs.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Gardini 'admitted irregularities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Raul Gardini, the Italian entrepreneur who commited suicide last month,
reportedly confirmed in a letter to Milan magistrates many alleged financial
irregularities at Ferruzzi, Italy's second-biggest industrial company, while
he led the company.
The allegations were made in leaked testimony by Mr Giuseppe Garofano and Mr
Carlo Sama, two former Ferruzzi executives arrested last month.
The letter, extracts of which were released yesterday before publication in
the Panorama news magazine, appear to confirm allegations of a substantial
shortfall in Ferruzzi's accounts as a result of undeclared borrowings and
attempts to cover up losses.
Mr Gardini's letter admits to a shortfall of Dollars 250m to Dollars 270m
(Pounds 181.2m) in Ferruzzi's accounts by July 1991. That was when Mr
Gardini's wife, a daughter of Ferruzzi's founder, sold her shares in the
family holding company which controls Ferruzzi.
Mr Gardini is reported to have admitted in his letter that the shortfall
corresponded to losses Ferruzzi had incurred in US commodity futures trading
in 1989. Only about Dollars 150m of the losses were disclosed in Ferruzzi's
1990 accounts. Other executives have alleged Mr Gardini authorised them to
cover up the remainder.
The losses were hidden by so-called 'back-to-back' financings, using a
Swiss-based financial intermediary who had traditionally worked for the
Ferruzzis.
The system worked by using non-consolidated subsidiaries of Ferruzzi's
Montedison industrial subsidiary to take out bank loans, which would then be
used either to plug losses elsewhere in the Ferruzzi business or to finance
projects which Mr Gardini wanted to keep off the group's balance sheet.
The admission explains the surprise revision in June of Montedison's 1992
accounts. Shareholders were shocked to see the group's consolidated losses
rise by L435bn to L1,679bn (Pounds 701m) because of mysterious 'credits',
unexpectedly deemed to be irrecoverable, by an obscure Curacao-based
subsidiary.
Mr Gardini's letter confirms the steady use, from 1988, of 'back-to-back'
financing to boost the group's resources. By 1991, the letter says the
undeclared borrowings had risen to about L1,000bn.
The letter adds that Ferruzzi used the Swiss intermediary to buy shares in a
number of takeover deals.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Slow creation of jobs in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE slow US recovery last month generated about 162,000 civilian jobs,
lowering the unemployment rate from 7 per cent in June to 6.8 per cent,
according to the US Labour Department.
The figures were consistent with other economic news of the week which shows
the economy recovering slowly. Republicans seized on the news to claim that
President Bill Clinton's budget plan, if passed by the Senate, would push
the economy back into recession.
Most economists say the economic plan will have virtually no effect on
either employment or the economy. The Global Securities Research and
Economics Group of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co yesterday issued an analysis
suggesting Mr Clinton may actually meet his campaign promise of creating 8m
jobs during his administration.
Most of the jobs created in July were in low-paying sectors, say Merrill
Lynch. 'During the past year, temporary help, health services, other
services and restaurants each accounted for nearly 25 per cent of private
payroll gains, with other sectors contributing almost nothing.'
Mr William Barron, deputy commissioner of labour statistics, says the
better-paid manufacturing sector continued to lose jobs last month, but the
loss of 13,000 was much smaller than in the previous three months and the
declines were concentrated in fewer industries than previously.
Many economists believe the worst is over for the US economy on the
unemployment front. Although there will still be heavy lay-offs, the savings
and loan bail-out is nearing an end and many companies have completed
painful restructuring. Last month the finance sector added 14,000 jobs.
Analysts say the floods in the Midwest will affect workers in devastated
communities and temporarily displace many from their jobs.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Moscow sticks with reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE divided Russian government yesterday stuck to its middle-of-the-road
reform course, throwing out command-style economic plans from Mr Oleg Lobov,
the first deputy prime minister.
But it also approved credit expansion targets which exceed those agreed with
the International Monetary Fund.
At an expanded cabinet meeting attended by heads of Russia's 89 regions and
republics, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin presented and received
approval for a medium-term programme which forecasts economic recovery in
1996. He warned that 'government leaders' at odds with cabinet policy would
have to step down, although it was not clear whether he was referring to Mr
Lobov or to Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical finance minister, who has
attacked a botched monetary reform endorsed by the prime minister.
Mr Sergei Vasiliev, head of the government centre for monitoring economic
reform and one of the programme's authors, said 'it neither added nor
subtracted anything' to reform.
The cabinet, however, adopted a resolution setting credit growth at 30 per
cent in the third and fourth quarter. This compares with targets of 20 and
15 per cent agreed with the IMF. The programme, however, still aims to cut
inflation and the budget deficit to levels agreed with the Fund.
Reformers drew at least some comfort from the rejection on the eve of the
cabinet meeting of an alternative programme which would have re-imposed
centralised economic planning. It was drawn up by Mr Lobov, who was
appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to appease conservatives before the
unexpected referendum victory in April.
Yesterday's parallel sessions of the cabinet and parliament had been billed
as a potential showdown between conservatives and reformers. The most
dramatic event of the day was parliament's decision to suspend Mr Yeltsin's
latest decree overriding parliament's cancellation of his measures to speed
privatisation. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, promised
swift but unspecified 'counter-measures'.
And despite calls by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman, for
the punishment of those 'guilty' of the central bank's crude monetary
reform, parliament passed the mildest resolutions on the bank-note
operation, saying it was understandable.

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S federal Economics Ministry will not extend new export credit
guarantees to Russia. However, the decision will not apply to other
countries of the former Soviet Union.
A spokesman for the ministry said the risk in extending fresh Hermes credits
to Russia was too great for the German government to bear. By the end of
next month, Russian enterprises will owe DM500m (Pounds 194.5m) in interest
payments on imports bought from Germany. Total exposure by the Hamburg-based
export credit insurance agency to the former Soviet republics is about
DM30bn.
Bonn had last year already placed a ceiling of DM5bn on the amount of
credits available to Russian and companies from other republics importing
from west German enterprises. It also insisted that German exporters had to
show that what they were exporting would help generate foreign exchange
earnings for former Soviet republics, and/or prevent an east German
enterprise from collapsing.
Export credits to the whole of the former Soviet Union amounted this year to
DM4bn.

GEORGIA'S parliament yesterday named head of state Eduard Shevardnadze
temporary prime minister after the government of Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua
resigned, Reuter reports.
In a vote, the legislature gave Mr Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign
minister, two weeks to put forward a new cabinet to grapple with the
economic disintegration and military upheavals facing the country.
Mr Shevardnadze had warned that Georgia was exposed to grave danger and
could only be saved by centralising power and introducing an 'emergency
regime'. In a televised address he said: 'The fight that has begun in
Georgia could become the start of civil war, the gravest civil war.'
Separatist conflict in the region of Abkhazia and post-Soviet economic
disintegration have brought the country to the brink of collapse.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Canada have reached agreement on a long-running dispute that
Ontario beer retail stores, owned by Canadian breweries, also will sell
American beer, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
Canada has agreed to eliminate its tariff on US beer - 16 cents a litre -
and to lower Ontario's minimum beer price. But it will not remove Ontario's
10 cents-a-unit levy on beer sold in cans, which is intended to encourage
the use of re-usable glass bottles.
Large American breweries are unhappy with the settlement, which they say
allows the use of environmental measures as trade barriers, and they worry
that it will be imitated by other countries.
Canadian brewers said that the decision 'allows the industry on both sides
to end the uncertainty and get back to the business of selling beer'.
