FT  07 AUG 93 / EC warned of need to strengthen co-operation: Brussels
underlines threat to aim of monetary union

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday issued a warning to all 12 European
Community member states that they must reinforce co-operation or risk losing
any chance of achieving economic and monetary union in the foreseeable
future.
At an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis over European monetary policy,
the Commission underlined the serious threat to both monetary union and the
single market programme after last weekend's relaxation of the exchange rate
mechanism.
The Commission did not say the timetable for Emu, as set out in the
Maastricht treaty, had been derailed by the currency market turmoil, but in
a communique released after its meeting, it issued a 'solemn appeal' to the
12 governments to reinforce their co-operation in all fields.
'The Commission in no way underestimates the gravity of the events which
have weakened the credibility of European construction,' the communique
said.
The clear implication was that, as European currencies float more freely
after the widening of bands in which ERM currencies may fluctuate, there is
a greater chance of nations indulging in competitive devaluations of their
currencies to boost export share in the single market.
Mr Henning Christopherson, the European commissioner for financial affairs,
said: 'We want to underline how serious the situation now is in the
Community.'
Sir Leon Brittan, external economic affairs commissioner, said: 'Emu is not
going away and will not go away. The case for it is too strong. No one
should underestimate the gravity of what happened at the weekend but equally
no one should underestimate the will to rebuild economic and monetary
co-operation.'
Yesterday's meeting was described as 'grave but collegial' by a Commission
spokesman. However, it is likely that detailed discussion was difficult
because three of the 17 commissioners were absent from the meeting,
including the two Germans Mr Martin Bangemann and Mr Peter Schmidhuber. One
of the French commissioners, Mrs Christiane Scrivener, responsible for EC
tax policy, was also absent on holiday.
The Commission underlined the importance of the assessments that it is due
to make before the end of the year on the progress of European economic and
monetary convergence.
These will accompany a white paper, which the Commission is planning to
submit to member states at the Brussels summit in December, and which will
deal with problems of competition, growth and employment.

FT  07 AUG 93 / TV-am seeks better luck at the tables of Crockfords Plc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GARRY NESBITT was trained as a tap dancer by his show business parents
but it was business he was interested in, so he took a gamble and applied
for a job at Crockfords when it opened as London's first legal casino in
1961.
As a gaming room valet dressed in 18th century breeches, he smoothed the
green baize of the tables and served chocolates to the ladies playing
chemin-de-fer.
Yesterday Mr Nesbitt, chairman of Crockfords, was looking forward to being
chairman of Crockfords Plc when the company is listed on the London Stock
Exchange on September 1.
It follows yesterday's reverse takeover by TV-am, the commercial breakfast
television company that gambled and lost in 1991's auction for new ITV
licences.
The deal will make Mr Nesbitt, who along the way ran casinos for Mecca and
created and sold the Our Price record chain to WH Smith for Pounds 46m, as
rich as many of the international gamblers to come to Crockfords in the
heart of London's Mayfair.
In Crockfords, under the Robert Adam ceilings of a house built in 1760, it
is possible to lose a great deal of money and some do - Pounds 500,000 or
even Pounds 1m in a single night. The lowest bet you can place at Crockfords
is Pounds 5 on a single number at roulette, although the Pounds 600 limit
gives a better idea of what goes on.
'You can bet more by private arrangement,' says Mr Nesbitt who then unlocks
the door of the salon privee, where the really high rollers can go if they
want solitude and silence to win or lose enormous sums.
Here, surrounded by prints and pictures, the minimum bet on the roulette
wheel is Pounds 1,000.
When Mr Nesbitt bought Crockfords in 1990 from Brent Walker for Pounds 50m
it was a huge gamble. 'It was a mid-market casino,' he says. 'It was
virtually a down-market casino. People were playing for Pounds 2. It was
ridiculous.' His aim has been to take Crockfords up market to appeal to the
international elite. 'We have created a very high-stake, high-volume
casino,' he adds.
Over the past three years, 10 'exceptional' players have accounted for 50
per cent of profits, which rose to almost Pounds 20m in 1992. One gambler in
his 60s accounted for no less than 40 per cent of last year's profits,
underlining how much casinos at the top end of the market rely on the right
high rollers coming through the door.
Institutions who backed TV-am and are staying to see how their luck holds at
the gaming tables must be hoping his health holds.
Recently an unknown South American walked into the club. A huge gambler in
Las Vegas, he had heard about Crockfords.
'London is still the gaming capital of the world,' Mr Nesbitt insists,
although in recent years Middle Eastern clients have given way in large part
to the rich of Hong Kong, Singapore and and Japan.
As long as they still come to London to do deals, there will be money to be
made in the premier league of London casinos, all within walking distance in
Mayfair. They include Aspinalls only two doors away from Crockfords in
Curzon Street.
'The British don't come. This is a 98 per cent export business. We should
get a Queen's Award for Exports,' says Mr Nesbitt, who now hopes to buy
other casinos in London and take the Crockfords way of doing business to
other countries.
For many people, the recession may be barely over but in London casinos
business is already beginning to boom, probably helped by the devaluation of
the pound. Last year the turnover at London's casinos reached Pounds 1.2bn.
This year, as much as Pounds 1.44bn in chips could be put at risk on the
smooth green baize.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Clinton battles for support in Senate budget bill vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night faced a decisive vote in the US Senate
that will make or break his compromise bill to slash the US budget deficit
by Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years.
Democrat leaders feared yesterday the Senate outcome might need the
tie-breaking vote of Vice President Al Gore.
Hours earlier, the bill scraped through the House of Representatives with a
majority of only two votes. Democrats said the vote last night might be even
closer. The bill must be passed by both the House and Senate.
As the final speeches began, party managers were still not totally confident
of victory.
The result in the House the night before had been in doubt with Mr Clinton
making a vital telephone call to a wavering congresswoman only 15 minutes
before the vote.
Mrs Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who had said she would vote against the
bill, then switched sides and to Democrat applause gave Mr Clinton his
majority, 218-216. Had she stuck to her original intention, the bill would
have been a vote short of the required 218 and Mr Clinton's presidency would
have suffered its single most serious reverse.
Mr Clinton has campaigned intensively for the bill which will raise Dollars
241bn in revenue, largely by raising income tax for the wealthiest
Americans, and imposing Dollars 255bn in spending cuts, to fall heavily on
the military.
However, the president has failed to convince many Americans that his
proposals will not damage the living standards of middle-income families, as
asserted by Republicans who have unanimously opposed the bill in both
houses, describing it as the biggest tax increase in US history.
Mr Clinton has also faced opposition within the conservative wing of his own
party which wants deeper spending cuts to achieve a more substantial deficit
reduction. On Thursday night in the House, 41 Democrats opposed the
compromise bill compared with 38 when the first version of the legislation
was passed.
It was a Democrat, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who yesterday appeared to
hold the key to the Senate vote. With 49 votes apparently assured for the
bill, a 'yes' from Mr Kerrey would tie the vote and give Mr Gore the
opportunity to pass the measure.
Mr Kerrey, a former candidate for the presidential nomination, is well known
for the length of time he takes to reach important decisions, earning him
the nick-name of 'Cosmic Bob'. He was called to the White House to see Mr
Clinton yesterday and discuss what further assurances he required on future
spending cuts in order to support the bill.
After the meeting Senator Kerrey declined to explain why he was delaying a
decision. 'It does not serve me very well, or the public, to get into a
discussion of what my internal thought processes are,' he declared.
Mr Clinton said after the House vote: 'I will continue to fight for this
economic package with everything I have.' He added: 'The margin was close
but the mandate clear.' With a positive Senate vote the country would 'enter
a new era of growth'.

FT  07 AUG 93 / London shares close at record high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON shares closed at a record high on beliefs that the European exchange
rate mechanism will soon allow interest rate cuts.
The FT-SE 100 index finished at 2,969.8, up 26.4 points on the day and UK
gilts closed 1 point up. The Paris bourse also ended 1.6 per cent higher at
a record close.
The D-Mark gained against most other European currencies as central banks
replenished their reserves of the German currency.
Although the French and Belgian francs and the Danish krone all finished
below their old floors against the D-Mark, their falls were constrained by
signs that governments are in no rush to cut borrowing rates.

FT  06 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson doubled to
Pounds 42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 16th August 1993) appended to this article.
KLEINWORT BENSON Group, the merchant bank, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 42.2m for the six months to June 30, almost double the Pounds 21.3m
achieved in the comparable period.
Lord Rockley, chairman, said that all sectors of the business contributed to
the rise. 'Higher operating profits were consistent throughout the group.
There were no one-off contributions'.
The company has given no indication that it expects the surge in
profitability to continue throughout the year. 'The outlook for the
remainder of the year is far from certain given international tensions and
potential problems in world trade, but we believe we are soundly based to
pursue a policy of further growth,' the company said.
However, it did not break down the contributions of its securities trading
activities - which have benefited from strong markets in the first half -
and corporate banking activities which have lost market share in recent
years.
The corporate finance division, although strong in overseas markets with
particular emphasis on privatisations, has lagged in the UK. This
performance was said to be one of the factors which led to the dismissal of
Mr Jonathan Agnew, chief executive, in May.
Lord Rockley said that rebuilding the group's stable of corporate clients
was among his chief priorities, although there would be no change in overall
strategy.
'What we will hope to do is to distinguish in people's minds the competence
that Kleinwort Benson has and sell ourselves with more vigour.' Among the
group's recent successes in the UK was a mandate to handle the floatation of
half of Banque Indosuez's Gartmore fund management subsidiary.
He said the group was still a long way from naming a successor to Mr Agnew.
That point is causing some concern with securities analysts who doubt the
group's ability to revive its fortunes without a strong chief executive.
The bank continued to pare back its loan book which fell to Pounds 1.9bn
from Pounds 2.1bn at year end. Lord Rockley said the group will withdraw
from corporate lending to those unlikely to generate any additional
fee-based business.
The interim dividend is raised from 5.3p to 6p, payable from earnings of
24.1p (10.8p) per share.
CORRECTION
An article in the Financial Times on August 6 incorrectly reported Mr
Jonathan Agnew as having been dismissed by Kleinwort Benson Group. In fact,
as Kleinworts said in a press release on May 4, Mr Agnew intended to resign
in August after the announcement of the interim results. The chairman's
statement of August 5 confirmed Mr Agnew's resignation on August 6. The FT
apologises to Mr Agnew for any embarrassment caused by the error.

FT  06 AUG 93 / People: Non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Fitch, one of the more permanent features in the rough and tumble
world of City corporate finance, is bowing out. He plans to retire as a
corporate finance director at Kleinwort Benson Securities when he reaches 60
at the end of the year and has picked up his first non-executive
directorship by joining the board of Manders, the Wolverhampton-based
paint-maker.
Roger Akers, Manders' chief executive, says that he has known Fitch for
quite a while but got to know him particularly well during last year's
takeover battle. Fitch was a member of the Kleinwort Benson team which
helped Manders defeat the unwelcome Pounds 86m bid from Kalon, a rival
paint-maker.
After working as an assistant secretary at the Stock Exchange, Fitch joined
stockbrokers Rowe and Pitman where he worked closely with the late Bill
Mackworth-Young, one of the big names in the corporate finance field 20
years ago and who later headed Morgan Grenfell. Fitch was head of corporate
finance at Rowe and Pitman between 1968 and 1976 and was heavily involved in
bringing two well-known names to the stock market - Pilkington in 1970 and J
Sainsbury in 1973.
During the oil price boom of the mid-1970s Fitch spent three years as
managing director of Wardley Middle East, the Hong Kong Bank's Dubai
merchant bank, before returning to the City in 1980 to join Grieveson Grant
which was later taken over by Kleinwort.

Douglas Holding, the German perfume and fashion retailer, said it's earnings
this year had met expectations, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Douglas said it was difficult to predict for the year since much depended on
Christmas sales. It posted a group operating profit for the first six months
of 1993 of DM43.7m (Dollars 25.7m) after DM43m in the same 1992 period.

FT  06 AUG 93 / VW shares rise sharply in Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen shares rose sharply in Frankfurt yesterday on hopes for a
'positive' outcome from tonight's extraordinary meeting of the vehicle
maker's supervisory board, writes Christopher Parkes.
The group's stocks rose DM12.5 to reach DM374 at the official close, but
continued climbing in after-market trading, reaching DM377.20 by late
afternoon.
Dealers said they expected the 20 non-executive directors to re-state their
unconditional support for Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, and Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director. Both men will attend and
present progress reports on restructuring and provide profit forecasts.
The market was also encouraged by Wednesday's announcement that a further
3,000 VW jobs in Germany are to be cut by the end of 1994. This was taken as
a sign of management determination to reduce costs.
By the end of next year the German workforce will have been cut to 100,000.
In the medium-term analysts expect a further 20,000 jobs to go.
The market is also expecting action to restore confidence in the group's
press and public relations activities, which have been shaken by Mr Piech's
abortive efforts to counter allegations of industrial espionage against Mr
Lopez by his former employer, General Motors.
The supervisory board is expected to try to help Mr Piech extricate himself
from what he himself called a 'mud-slinging war' with GM and its German
subsidiary Adam Opel, and return to the business of restoring VW to health.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Economic woes mount for Ciller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S highest inflation figures in 15 months, announced this week, could
hardly have come at a worse time for Mrs Tansu Ciller, the new prime
minister, as she prepares to launch her promised economic reforms.
Coupled with the recent resignations of three of her most senior
bureaucrats, including Central Bank governor Rusdu Saracoglu, a pivotal
figure in Turkey's economic progress in the 1980s, Mrs Ciller needs quick
results if she is to survive the expected challenge to her leadership in the
delegate convention of the True Path party set for November.
The Ciller economic programme envisages acceleration of state sell-offs,
reform of farm support policies, and tax changes to close the budget gap.
She promises more social spending.
Diplomats, however, say she faces an uneviable policy dilemma: whether to go
for bold reform now and risk confronting conservatives in her party and
other vested interests, or sit tight until after the party convention.
Her job is not made easier by annual inflation which rose to 73 per cent in
July, a month in which it would normally decline because of seasonal factors
such as cheaper food.
The government's need to finance the deficit, projected at around 15 per
cent of GDP for 1993, continues to sap the private sector by fuelling high
real interest rates and crowding out other borrowers. Mrs Ciller has had
some success in reducing short-term domestic borrowing, but in so doing has
been forced to approach the Central Bank with budgetary demands, thus
fuelling monetary expansion.
In Ankara last month, Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, deputy president of the World
Bank, applauded the government's plans.
The bank says it is prepared to help finance insurance and unemployment
schemes, without which the closure and labour redundancies related with
privatisation will would be politically difficult.
But already Mrs Ciller is confronted with public sector opposition to her
wage restraint policy. Big union protests have taken place almost daily for
the past two weeks in Ankara and other cities. Among the state sector
unions, Mrs Ciller's radical proposals for privatisation are likely to get
an even cooler reception.
The trade deficit is worsening, and for the first time the current account
looks under strain despite increased flows from tourism, Turkey's largest
single foreign exchange earner. Mrs Ciller believes that the lira is still
overvalued. However, a senior adviser this week denied rumours that a
devaluation was in the offing.
More worrying have been the signs of discontent within the bureaucracy over
Mrs Ciller's anti-inflation policy, particularly her attempts to cut high
interest rates. She still contends this the main cause of Turkey's
chronically high inflation.
On this point, Mr Saracoglu was uncharacteristically blunt in his criticism
of the prime minister.
His resignation, followed by the departure of state planning chief Ilhan
Kesici, reflects the opposition of many government economists.
No replacement has yet been found - the leading candidate, Mr Mahfi Egilmez,
a former Treasury official, was reported to have declined the offer.
Unlike President Suleyman Demirel, whose strategy was to 'talk up' the
economic prospects, Mrs Ciller has been apocalyptic in her warnings about
the consequences of failure. Many economists believe her best chance lies in
using the dismal inflation figures to argue for radical reform.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Russian private bank to get Dollars 15m loan from IFC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private investment
arm, yesterday granted a Dollars 15m loan to a private bank in the first
official attempt by the West to stimulate small and medium-sized business in
Russia.
The International Moscow Bank, a joint venture between Russian and Western
shareholders, will make medium- and long-term loans with the money, which is
to be repaid to the IFC by the year 2000.
The bank has lent less than Dollars 100m to finance projects within Russia
despite having Dollars 3bn on deposit - a striking indication of the
country's shortage of investment capital.
The bank says it cannot lend more than the equivalent of its shareholders'
funds because most of its funds are short-term deposits belonging to Russian
enterprises. The wider obstacles to medium- and long-term lending are lack
of confidence in Russia's investment climate and high inflation which makes
long-term rouble loans virtually impossible.
Mr Daniel Adams, the IFC's vice-president for capital markets, says the bank
will be a catalyst for loans by other institutions, even though external
lending could never compensate for the billions of dollars potentially
available inside the country.
Mr John Fitzgerald, a member of the IMB board, said there were a lot of
potentially lucrative projects in Russia despite a shortage of tools for
assessing projects.
The IMB recently lent Dollars 800,000 to help a small Russian company buy
equipment for the manufacture of caesin, a cheese-making ingredient with
export potential. The three-year loan was repaid within 15 months.
Projects eligible for the Dollars 15m fund must show a similar capacity to
generate foreign exchange.
The Russian government yesterday signed an Ecu145.3m (Dollars 161m) loan
with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to boost oil
production in western Siberia, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
The 15-year loan to the Purneftegas oil company, which will re-equip and
revive idle oil-wells and exploit new ones, carries a three-year grace
period and an interest rate of 4.5 per cent. Energy minister Yuri Shafranik,
said the loan would help build investor confidence. Mr Mario Sarcinelli,
EBRD vice-president, believes the project will be a model for other banks.

FT  06 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL trading between the futures and traded options arms of the Liffe
was behind a sharp fall in Footsie futures yesterday, writes Peter John.
Derivatives dealers said an early exercise of a large number of the August
2,850 and 2,900 FT-SE 100 call options prompted heavy selling of the Footsie
future for September.
As a result, September opened 15 down from the previous night's close and
traded even lower to hit 2,930, only a few points above the underlying cash
market.
When the technical position-taking was out of the way the futures began to
regain their lost ground. One analyst said: 'It was quite encouraging that
September picked up despite the selling pressure and the high level of the
market. It still feels quite firm.'
The September future was trading at 2,958 in after-hours' dealing,
comfortably above its estimated fair value premium to cash, which is
currently priced at around four points. However, turn-over was below 10,000
contracts, which is considered an average acceptable level.
Volume in traded options was boosted by some active business in Hanson. The
conglomerate was the top traded stock option with 4,339 lots transacted, and
most of the interest represented buying of call options. The bullish trade
prompted speculation of asset disposals within the company and drove the
underlying share price higher.

FT  06 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Logica bid denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong rumours that Cray Electronics was about to launch a hostile bid for
Logica brought a swift denial from Cray's chairman, who des-cribed the talk
as 'rubbish'. Electronics specialists said they believed the two groups may
have been involved in preliminary merger discussions earlier this year which
were subsequently broken off - prompting speculation that Cray may return as
a predator.
Cray recently reported a jump in profits from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 29m.
Logica was also in the news after two of its directors sold a total of
200,000 shares in the company last weekend. Cray shares slipped 3 1/2 to 149
1/2 p. Logica rose 5 to 246p.
Conglomerate Hanson was strong as heavy traded options buying sparked
renewed rumours that the board might be preparing asset disposals. Seasoned
Hanson analysts downplayed the talk. The shares gained 4 at 242p with 8.9m
traded, and a further 4m equivalent in the options market.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance conglomerate, declined 8 to 441p
after rival tobacco group Philip Morris backed off from a planned price
increase on its discount brand cigarettes. Dealers said an overnight trade
of 2m shares at below 440p a share also contributed to the fall.
Merchant banks performed well after strong results from Kleinwort Benson,
which reported first-half profits nearly doubled at Pounds 42.2m. Kleinwort
climbed 25 to 485p while SG Warburg moved ahead 10 to 774p and Schroders 43
to 1078p.
Better than expected interim results from Reed Elsevier pushed Reed
International forward 15 to a high for the day of 679p. But the share price
subsequently tumbled to close a net 4 off at 660p on market worries over the
group's current trading conditions and disappointment at the lack of advance
purchases of Official Airline Guides.
Hoare Govett said the market overreacted to the group's caution on trading
conditions and believed sentiment towards the group would improve when its
main markets in the US and UK picked up by the end of the year.
News International appreciated 6 to 244p on its newly acquired stake in Star
TV.
Printing group Hunterprint, which yesterday confirmed its contract with
Associated Newspapers to print 66 per cent of a new weekly supplement for
the Mail on Sunday from October, saw its shares climb a further 4 to 49p.
The two-way pull in the leisure sector showed no signs of abating as
investors tussled between the leading hoteliers, Forte and Ladbroke.
Turnover was down from the recent high levels, although the respective 2.3m
and 3.3m shares traded were still above average. Yesterday, dealers said UBS
was recommending Forte and SG Warburg was backing Ladbroke. Forte edged up a
penny to 217p and the latter closed 2 firmer at 200p.
Among drinks stocks, Invergordon Distillers remained the centre of attention
as the vague bid talk continued. With results due shortly, market talk is
focusing on the 41.2 per cent stake still held by its former suitor, Whyte &amp;
Mackay, and whether it will rebid. The shares ended 6 higher at 285p.
Price war worries overhung the food retailers in the wake of the launch this
week of Tesco's latest promotion. Credit Lyonnais Laing took the opportunity
to issue a 'buy' note on the supermarket group, arguing that the launch of
the new 'Value' range is another example of Tesco management attempting to
improve its competitiveness.
Mr Neil Currie at Credit Lyonnais said: 'Tesco is refocusing on the
mass-market proportion of its customer base. We believe there is little
downside risk to the shares but plenty of potential upside.' The shares
nudged a half-penny forward to 209p.
Food manufacturing shares made further gains as worries over brand values
faded and investors looked to buy following the sector's recent
underperformance. Among those catching up, Associated British Foods improved
3 to 486p, Cadbury-Schweppes 2 to 476p and Unigate 10 to 382p. Among second
liners, Dalepak rose 9 to 188p, Dalgety 3 to 464p and Associated Fisheries 5
to 129p.
Stores were in demand, with Boots responding again to Wednesday's 'buy' note
from SG Warburg and adding 4 at 478p. A squeeze in Dixons left the stock 4
ahead at 227p. Next was buoyed by further talk of a link with GUS and other
gossip that sales were up around 13 per cent. The shares put on 4 at 197 1/2
p, their level of nearly four years ago.
Motor components group GKN survived a number of negative broker notes
yesterday and the shares hardened a penny to 490p. NatWest Securities and
Nikko both pointed out that the group's trading was threatened by its
geographical spread, which leaves it vulnerable to the economic downturn in
Europe.
Good traffic figures from British Airways, published on Wednesday, helped
the stock pick up 2 to 341p. The shares had fallen on worries over the
decline in the load factor, but yesterday Panmure Gordon and NatWest were
both pointing to the growth in the premium traffic.

<TEXT>
Shell Transport slipped as the market concentrated on the headline profits
from the Royal Dutch arm and refused to discount the effect of exceptional
charges.
The second quarter for Royal Dutch saw net income up at Pounds 619m, but
once the exceptional charge of Pounds 183m was removed, the underlying
figure was above Pounds 800m and at the top end of expectations.
Nevertheless, the market was unyielding and sold the UK shares down 9 1/2 to
633p.
Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst with Hoare Govett, said the shares were
overvalued but the results should not have provided an excuse to sell. Ms
Irene Himona of SGST said that on her forecasts the stock was offering a 4.8
per cent yield and presented a buy opportunity.
British Petroleum, on the other hand, firmed 2 1/2 to 306p after announcing
operating profits of Pounds 581m on a replacement cost basis after bouncing
back from the heavy losses of last summer.

The shares, which are subject to a buy-back offer from the company, jumped
55 to 1515p. Just before the close of trading in London the appetite for
stock was so great that trading screens showed a backwardation, a technical
situation whereby the bid and offer quotes are reversed. One hour after the
London close, 1.6m shares had been traded in New York, where the equivalent
price reached 1530p.
Dealers said that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was recommending
Reuters strongly. Also, US brokerage house Merrill Lynch published a buy
recommendation, highlighting improved prospects for foreign exchange dealing
following widening of the European exchange rate mechanism bands. Some 60
per cent of Reuters' business is linked to foreign exchange dealing.
In London, Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency broker, also published a buy
note. Analyst Mr Brian Newman focused on the buy-back scheme, which
technically offers the chance to receive 1400p a share, but around 1720p for
tax-exempt gross income funds.
He estimates that 35 per cent of the equity is held by these funds, who are
refusing to let go of their highly valued shares before the tender on August
25. 'An acute stock shortage has developed in London,' said Mr Newman.
There was also talk of a stock lending crisis. Stock lending is a device
whereby marketmakers can borrow shares from institutions to balance their
books.

FT  06 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Peak for the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND line issues continued to lead the UK stock market ahead yesterday,
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index hitting a new high, although the blue chip leaders
brushed off early losses to renew the advance of the past fortnight. Much of
the day's action in equities was led from the stock index futures sector.
The reluctant acceptance that cuts in interest rates in continental Europe
and the UK may well be postponed was balanced by renewed firmness in
London's government bond market.
Initial weakness, largely prompted by falls in stock index futures, took the
FT-SE 100 Index down by more than 15 points. But 2,925.7 proved to be the
day's low, and a gradual recovery then ensued which took the index to a
closing 2,943.4, a net 2.1 up at the highest reading of the session.
Traders professed themselves more than happy with the resilience shown by
the blue chips but the strongest performance came from the second-line
stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250, which has now risen by more than 5 per cent in a
straight line for over a fortnight, closed last night at a new peak of
3,362.3, up 12.9 on the session. Some fund managers have, however, expressed
dissatisfaction with the size of the 'spreads'  - the gap between buying and
selling prices quoted by marketmakers - on many second-line stocks. Wide
spreads can make share trading very expensive.
Turnover in non-Footsie stocks fell yesterday to provide only about 58 per
cent of the day's Seaq total of 616.4m shares. On Wednesday, 735.9m shares
were traded through the Seaq network, worth Pounds 1.56bn in retail
business. Retail, or customer, business, the life-blood of the equity
market, has risen sharply over the past five sessions.
With currency markets now calmer and the excitement over ERM currencies more
broadly absorbed into the UK financial markets, institutional investors are
content to reshuffle portfolios rather than to chase share prices. Stock
shortage has begun to show itself in many blue chip stocks and the
unwillingness of fund managers to buy at any price has reasserted itself as
a factor in equities.
This was reinforced yesterday in the form of a severe squeeze on shares of
Reuters Holdings, the global financial reporting group, where the board's
buy-back plan has strengthened institutions' unwillingness to part with
shares.
Stock index traders have found that stock in the Footsie blue chips is by no
means readily available when opportunities for arbitrage between stock index
futures and cash present themselves.
Profits were again taken in the consumer and retail sectors, which are most
closely allied to interest rate hopes. But losses were small and sector
analysts remained confident that lower rates are on the way.
Banking and financial shares moved nervously around overnight levels as the
profits reporting season rolled on. Among the best favoured was HSBC, still
benefiting from this week's trading report, which cast a favourable light on
recovery at Midland, the UK banking subsidiary.
Results from Royal Dutch and from British Petroleum found a cautious
reception in London and analysts continued to focus on the uncertain outlook
for crude prices.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Gold shares tumble as bullion
price weakens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets struggled to make any headway for the third straight day,
with share prices trading in a narrow range either side of opening values,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 3.08 easier at 3,548.97 and the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.41 off at 448.13, but the Nasdaq
composite firmed 1.71 to 715.50, another all-time high. Trading volume on
the New York SE was 262m shares.
The inability of the stock markets to break out of three days of
directionless trading is due primarily to uncertainty over the passage of
President Clinton's first budget through Congress. Yesterday the House of
Representatives was due to vote on the deficit-reduction package, and today
the Senate is scheduled to pass its vote.
Although last-minute efforts by the Clinton administration appeared, as of
yesterday, to have ensured that the budget would be approved, investors fear
that if it falls at the final hurdle, bond prices will drop sharply,
triggering a rapid sell-off in the equity markets. Consequently, investors
and dealers have been reluctant to commit themselves to the markets over the
past few days.
Among individual issues, gold shares tumbled following a sharp decline in
gold bullion prices on world markets. American Barrick Resources fell
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 24 3/8 , Newmont Mining Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53
1/2 , Newmont Gold Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 45 1/2 , Homestake Mining
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 3/4 and Battle Mountain Gold Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 9 1/4 , all in exceptionally heavy trading.
Delta Air Lines receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 after the big carrier
announced sharp cuts in air fares as it fired the latest shot in the
long-running price war. Other carriers quickly reduced their own fares,
leading to heavy selling throughout the sector. AMR, parent of American
Airlines, fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 , USAir slipped Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 16 5/8 and UAL dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 142.
Quaker Oats climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 64 1/4 after the company announced
a 31 per cent increase in second-quarter earnings per share, a better
improvement than analysts had expected.
Retailers were mixed. JC Penney retreated Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/2
after announcing that its same-store sales fell 3.1 per cent last month,
while Wal-Mart put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 25 3/4 on news of higher
sales.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 74 3/4
after the company said that it plans to become a minority investor in
multi-media ventures.
Canada
HEAVY losses in gold shares drove the natural resource-heavy Toronto Stock
Exchange to a sharply lower close. Gold issues tumbled after Comex gold
futures fell steeply: most active were the December futures, which slid
USDollars 22.60 to USDollars 380.70 an ounce.
The TSE 300 index finished 41 points, or 1.1 per cent, down at 3,947.6 and
declines led advances by 454 to 296 after volume of 53.4m shares valued at
CDollars 577m. The golds sector index lost 738.1 points, or 7.7 per cent, to
8,848.5.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Philips gains 4.8 per cent in
Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the fallout from the ERM crisis begins to clear, a number of brokers have
started to set out their thoughts on investment prospects, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Mr Anthony Thomas of Kleinwort Benson commented in the broker's latest
investment handbook that while interest rates outside Germany would fall
sharply in the short term 'we remain cautious on the outlook for growth as
consumer confidence remains very weak in view of widespread fears over
unemployment'.
The broker recommended overweighting France in relation to Germany: the
latter's short-term D-Mark strength and relatively high interest rates will
dash 'hopes of a near-term recovery in activity'.
Merrill Lynch's strategists also followed the interest rate argument, noting
that they would continue a shift towards cyclicals.
However, the broker remained cautious about the prospects for German
cyclicals: 'The competitiveness of German industry is already at a 20-year
low ..and last week's ERM changes are likely to exacerbate this problem'.
AMSTERDAM was occupied with a host of results from Philips, Royal Dutch and
Elsevier. The CBS Tendency index ended the day 0.3 higher at 123.1.
Philips satisfied expectations with a 48 per cent gain in second quarter net
profit, the shares gaining Fl 1.60 to Fl 34.80, but off the day's high of Fl
35.30.
Royal Dutch disappointed a number of analysts and the shares came off Fl
2.10 to Fl 181.20.
Elsevier, which initially rose strongly after announcing its results, fell
back towards the close, the shares ending down Fl 1.10 to Fl 135.70.
KLM was another strong performer, up 50 cents to Fl 34.20.
FRANKFURT took a breather after the last few days, the DAX index edging just
0.14 forward to 1,860.70, having moved between a high of 1,867 and a low of
1,845.
Turnover was DM9.3bn.
Among the movers was Mannesmann, helped by a positive note from Merrill
Lynch which recommended a switch out of Preussag. The broker argued that
while Preussag had outperformed the sector over the past 18 months,
Mannesmann still appeared undervalued on the basis of higher earnings in
1994-95 helped by its efforts to restructure.
Mannesmann added DM5.70 or 1.9 per cent to DM309, and Preussag lost DM1.50
to DM414.
In the car sector Volkswagen gained DM12.50 or 3.5 per cent to DM374 ahead
of today's extraordinary board meeting, while BMW was off DM6 at DM546.50,
in reaction to lower west German car orders.
MILAN saw renewed speculative buying of banking shares, but this was not
enough to contain profit-taking pressure after the market's nine-day run and
the Comit index shed 1.37 to 580.47.
However, the underlying mood remained positive and Mr Marco Ortelli of
brokers Akros Sim in Milan saw no reason, based on fundamentals, why the
market should not rise to the 610 level before it meets further resistance.
In his monthly review, Mr Enrico Ponzone of Kleinwort Benson remained
optimistic for the long term.
'After successfully completing the cost of labour negotiations and
introducing the long awaited electoral reform, the government is now poised
to approve the 1994 budget law. This, together with the latest developments
in the ERM, will lead to further rate cuts in the autumn providing the
market with further momentum,' he said.
Credito Italiano added L168 to L2,766 and BCI was L68 higher at L5,465
following Wednesday's restatement of the government's intention to sell them
swiftly.
However, the recently favoured telecommunications sector came under pressure
in response to renewed concerns about a delay in the privatisation process.
Stet slid L62 to L4,059 while Sip fell L61 to L3,127.
ZURICH was dragged lower by a fall in Nestle and the SMI index gave up 6.2
to 2,424.5.
Nestle shed SFr20 to a year's low of SFr1,017 on heavy profit-taking by US
investors amid a resurgence of concern about the value of its portfolio of
brand names. Analysts have also noted that chart analysis of the share price
indicates that the share has the potential for considerable further downward
adjustment.
Swissair fell SFr23 to SFr750 on worries ahead of half year results, due
today.
PARIS added 13.94 to the CAC-40 index, closing at 2,115.30. Turnover
remained healthy at FFr4bn. Goldman Sachs has recently forecast that the
index will reach 2,650 in a year, and believes that the market is currently
undervalued.
Some profit-taking among individual stocks continued. LVMH lost FFr40 to
FFr4,117 after announcing that it had bought Kenzo, the fashion house, for
some FFr482m.
St Gobain slipped FFr1 to FFr591 ahead of announcing a fall in first half
sales after the close.
STOCKHOLM remained strong, helped by good gains in Astra B, up SKr13 to
SKr154. and Ericsson B, up SKr6 at SKr354.
The Affarsvarlden index added 22.40 or 1.8 per cent to 1,241.50.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Conflicting equity signals emanate from
Malaysia - The market is at a peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kuala Lumpur equity market is putting out conflicting signals.
Since the beginning of the year the composite index has surged by more than
22 per cent. On most recent days the market has been reaching new highs,
closing yesterday at 785.49.
Yet brokers describe the market as lethargic. 'The index might still be
going up, but there is not much excitement about,' said one.
Brokers are a hard group to satisfy. Earlier this year dealers were
complaining of fatigue as frenzied activity took daily trading volume in
Kuala Lumpur to levels well above those of Tokyo or New York. On one day in
April more than 1bn units valued at nearly MDollars 2.5bn (Dollars 1bn) were
traded.
Most of that activity was focused on secondary stocks: rumours of impending
government contracts and license awards, for instance, drove some relatively
unknown stocks up by as much as 300 per cent.
'That was a real gamblers' market - almost completely rumour driven,' said a
broker. 'Now people have settled down. It is the institutions and foreign
funds that are now taking a more measured look at the fundamentals. They are
opting for the quality, blue chip stocks.'
Most large companies are performing well against the background of continued
buoyant economic growth. In each of the past five years Malaysia's GDP has
risen by more than 8 per cent. Earlier predictions that growth would slow as
the country felt the full effects of recession in its main export markets
seem ill-founded: most analysts forecast growth once again above the 8 per
cent level this year.
The pattern of market activity, as compared to April, has completely
reversed. Then, there were high volumes traded, but there was only a slight
rise in the market. Now volumes are low, around an average of little more
than 2m shares, but the index has kept on rising.
A handful of companies account for more than 50 per cent of total market
capitalisation. Relatively slim trading in their stocks can quickly change
the market's direction.
Tenaga, the partially privatised electricity utility, and Telekom, the
telecommunications company, which together account for over 30 per cent of
total market capitalisation, have been performing well, trading near or at
their highs for the year. Their shares closed yesterday at MDollars 11.10
and MDollars 15.70 respectively.
Banking stocks, led by Maybank, the country's largest financial institution,
have been performing particularly well recently. Maybank's full year
figures, due soon, are expected to show the kind of growth for which many
western bankers would give up their board room chairs: in the six months to
December 31 1992 Maybank's pre-tax profits rose by 27 per cent to MDollars
346.53m (Dollars 135m).
Gaming-related stocks, long a favourite on the Malaysian market, have also
been climbing. Like skilful gamblers, some companies have been playing the
China card - letting it be known that they are likely to win substantial
gaming licenses in various Chinese cities. As a consequence their stock
prices have climbed.
The stock exchange authorities have stepped in to try to separate rumour
from reality: some companies have been reprimanded for being less than
candid about the exact status of their China projects.
Politics have also been influencing market behaviour. There has been a
considerable amount of corporate restructuring over recent months. Analysts
say that much of this is due to important elections within the dominant
United Malays National Organisation in November.
A closely fought contest is under way for UMNO vice-president, the outcome
of which is likely to determine who succeeds Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime
minister.
Another focus of attention is the 1994 budget, due to be presented to
parliament later this year. There are hopes of a reduction in the 34 per
cent corporate tax rate and other cuts in personal taxes.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as Hong Kong
resumes advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices tended to slip back as most investors waited for the
inauguration of the new government, which was delayed by the Liberal
Democratic Party's attempts to stall the start of the parliamentary session,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 71.91 to 20,425.64 in quiet trading. The index rose
to the day's high of 20,557.46 in the morning, but retreated on small-lot
selling by investment trusts and public funds, setting a low of 20,376.24 in
the afternoon.
Volume shrank to 230m shares from 301m. Declines outscored rises by 625 to
330, with 195 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
finished 2.00 easier at 2,227.44. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was a
slight 0.56 firmer at 1,263.95.
The special parliamentary session to name Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, head of
Japan New Party, as prime minister failed to start as scheduled as the LDP
and the coalition parties failed to agree on parliamentary procedures.
Meanwhile, speculation arose of an imminent cut in the official discount
rate, but most investors remained on the sidelines.
Market participants focused on the debut of Taito, a video game maker, on
the second section of the Tokyo stock exchange. The public offering price of
Taito was a record Y7.27m. A lack of sellers pushed the stock up to a bid
price of Y9.2m after an initial trading price of Y9.01m. Investors were
encouraged by Taito's projection of a 65 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
for the current year to March.
Financials were supported by expectations of a discount rate reduction.
Trust banks gained ground, with Sumitomo Trust and Banking adding Y30 at
Y1,420, while insurance companies also strengthened, Tokio Marine &amp; Fire
appreciating Y30 to Y1,340.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 121.42 to 22,369.95 in volume of 21.8m
shares.
Roundup
STRONG overseas demand helped to drive some Pacific Rim markets ahead.
HONG KONG was sharply higher, powered by a 5 per cent surge in HSBC on
strong buying from overseas,
The Hang Seng index finished 143.34, or 2 per cent, ahead at 7,307.54 in
heavy turnover of HKDollars 4.7bn.
HSBC's advance of HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 80 followed the profits rise at
its Midland Bank subsidiary and a perception that bank earnings are set to
rise worldwide as bad debt burdens shrink.
AUSTRALIA was helped by strong overseas buying, particularly among base
metal issues and blue chips, and the All Ordinaries index gained 4.1 at
1,865.3, another post-1987 crash high.
Selling of gold shares throughout the day was offset by a host of buy
orders, many from overseas, with the large base metal miners winning the
most attention.
MIM climbed 13 cents to ADollars 2.40 in volume of 16m shares in response to
rumours of a buy order of around ADollars 20m.
NEW ZEALAND forged ahead on news that the government had cut tax for foreign
portfolio investors, with shares hitting a 3 1/2 -year high at one stage
before prices eased back at the close.
The NZSE-40 capital index finished 36.34, or 1.9 per cent, higher at
1,893.87, after a day's peak of 1,913.41. Turnover was a heavy NZDollars
74m.
TAIWAN ended slightly higher, buoyed by strong speculative demand for paper
stocks. The weighted index put on 9.31 at 4,055.52 in active turnover of
TDollars 20.29bn.
Heavy buying was seen in Shihlin Paper, which rose TDollars 3 to TDollars
79.50 on media reports that it would soon start developing a property site
which had not been used for years.
SEOUL was encouraged by news that the government would allow investment
trust companies to extend the maturity date on the repayment of soft loans
to the central bank. The composite index moved forward 12.03 to 732.05.
BOMBAY was closed for the day to enable brokers to settle unmatched trades.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: French franc falls again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone were somewhat softer
against the D-Mark yesterday in spite of the policy of all three countries
to keep their overnight interest rates at very high levels, writes James
Blitz.
The French franc was trading at around FFr3.4625 against the D-Mark at the
start of European trading. But the franc soon fell back to a low of
FFr3.4775 after the Bank of France effectively revealed that its foreign
exchange reserves had been severely depleted by intervention in support of
the franc in recent weeks.
Economists have calculated that the Bank of France's official net reserves
fell by some FFr100.5bn in the week to July 29, using figures issued by the
central bank yesterday.
Some analysts said this would have left the Bank of France with only
FFr12.5bn going into Friday July 30, when there was massive intervention to
support the franc.
That depletion of reserves would partly explain why the Bank of France
allowed the franc to fall through the critical FFr3.4180 level that it had
been defending that morning. But it also suggests that the country may have
a negative net reserves position, since the figures do not take into account
swaps and forward selling of the franc.
The franc closed in London last night at FFr3.469 to the D-Mark from a
previous FFr3.466. This was in spite of an overnight cost of borrowing of
around 12 per cent.
The Danish krone weakened despite its one-month interest rates staying at 25
per cent. It finished at about DKr3.9498 to the D-Mark, having been at
DKr3.9225 at the start of the day. The Belgian franc fell outside its former
ERM band against the D-Mark, ending at BFr21.11, just below its old ERM
floor of BFr21.09.
The Spanish peseta also fell back yesterday, receiving little support from
the government's new plans to rein in the country's budget deficit. Mr Pedro
Solbes, the Spanish finance minister, announced that current spending plans
next year will be frozen and that spending on social items will rise by 6
per cent, maintaining its relative weight in GDP.
The weakness of the D-Mark due to this high interest rate policy in Europe
continued to give some upside to the dollar, which closed at DM1.7165 from a
previous DM1.7105. But the US currency finished New York trading at
DM1.7116.
The dollar was partly supported by better than expected jobless claims
figures, which showed a decline in US first time jobless claims to 336,000
in the week to July 31 after a revised 396,000 in the prior week. US June
factory orders also improved. They were up 2.6 per cent, the first gain in
four months.
However, sterling eased against the D-Mark yesterday amid some speculation
that the UK would cut base rates later in the year. The pound ended at
DM2.5600, down from Wed-nesday's DM2.5675 close.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Money Markets: High rates continue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central banks of France, Belgium and Denmark continued to keep
short-term interest rates high yesterday in their bid to preserve their
currencies' value against the D-Mark in the newly relaxed European exchange
rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The French authorities yesterday added FFr28.0bn of liquidity to the French
money markets and kept their intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent.
Both moves were seen as a continuation of the action to keep monetary policy
tight for the time being to manage the French franc's exchange rate. The
liquidity injection was tiny compared with the DM38.1bn added by the
Bundesbank in its weekly operation on Wednesday. The Belgian and Danish
authorities also kept monetary conditions tight in money market trading
yesterday.
All these moves had a negative impact on interest rate markets, where there
had been a general expectation that monetary policy would be eased
everywhere except in Germany.
September French franc futures dropped 14 basis points on the day to 93.53.
The December contract fell 12 points to a close of 93.65. French three-month
money was trading between 11 1/2 per cent and 13 per cent for most of the
day, penalising any speculator with leveraged positions against the French
franc.
Sterling futures also fell back as dealers continued to be taken aback by
European monetary policy.
The September contract declined 3 basis points to finish at 94.23, but
December was that amount up at a close of 94.68. Dealers clearly think the
rate cut will probably come between autumn and winter.
Three-month sterling interest rates remained at 5 13/16 per cent against the
background of a very small shortage in the discount market of Pounds 450m.
However, there was continued confidence of rate reductions in Germany as
call money spent another day hovering below the discount rate level of 6.75
per cent.
So many D-Marks have been pumped into the German banking system in the last
fortnight that call money stood yesterday at 6.65 per cent. The September
Euromark contract ended at 93.53, up 6 basis points on the day, while the
December contract was 5 basis points higher at 94.12.

Base metal prices largely finished in the minus column on the London Metal
Exchange as earlier advances and stability proved illusory, dealers said.
The three months COPPER price failed to penetrate resistance above Dollars
1,960 but the subsequent retreat was limited by continuing technical
tightness. The price closed at Dollars 1,952.50 a tonne, up Dollars 3.25.
The LEAD market consolidated below an early 2 1/2 -month high of Dollars 420
a tonne for three months metal, closing at Dollars 416.25 a tonne, up
Dollars 4.50. But traders expected the market to notch up further gains,
saying there was an undercurrent of Far Eastern buying interest. At the
London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices continued to ease back, with
contracts gaining up to Pounds 7 a tonne on total turnover of 5,474 lots.
Traders were waiting for fresh news, particularly from West Africa, and in
the meantime were content to let the market drift. White SUGAR futures had a
slow day as prices generally rose with New York. Near October was Dollars
1.50 up at Dollars 267.50 a tonne, in late trading. Traders were looking to
see if New York near Oct would manage to close above 10 cents a lb.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador opens oil blocks to
private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN effort to attract capital investment and boost production, Ecuador is
opening significant sectors of its petroleum industry to private enterprise.
Service contracts for oil exploration and production will be open for
bidding during September.
The government is also soliciting bids for a project to increase the
capacity of the country's two oil refineries and the Trans Ecuadorean
pipeline.
Increasing the capacity of the Refineria de Esmeraldas on the Pacific coast
will cost about Dollars 120m, while work on the Refineria Amazonas is
expected to cost Dollars 22.6m.
Work on the projects is expected to be completed within two years and four
years respectively.
The pipes leading from the Amazonian rain forest across the Andes to the
Pacific ports are to be fitted with higher capacity pumps, enabling them to
transport more heavy crude oil, the principal type of crude discovered
recently in the region.
Ecuador's new foreign investment regulations give foreign and national
investors equal opportunities.
Foreign oil companies are still subject to a flat 44.4 per cent income tax
for repatriated profits compared with 25 per cent for Ecuador companies.
A Bill is to be presented to congress shortly in an attempt to equalise this
tax structure.
Mr Hans Collin, executive president of Petroecuador, said between 40 and 45
foreign and national companies have shown interest in bidding for the
projects in this seventh solicitation round.
He estimated that the country's oil industry required about Dollars 5bn in
capital investment over the next five years to produce the projected 470m
barrels a day by 1995, up from 273,000 b/d last year.
Several area blocks which are now open for private sector exploitation in
the Amazon region as well as on the Pacific coast had previously been
reserved for Petroecuador.
Mr Henri Bergasse, general manager of the French company Elf Hydrocarbures
Equateur, said there were potentially interesting blocks opening up but that
there was a risk of encountering heavy crude oil again.
Production and transportation costs for heavy crude are considerably higher
than for light crude oil and will thus cut in to profits.
The solicitation will likely include Block 22, an area that has been subject
to considerable controversy due to its importance as an ecological 'hot
spot' and one of the last protected areas for indigenous people of the
region.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for gold increases 1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD DEMAND rose by 1 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared
with the same period in 1992 in spite of an 11 per cent rise in the US
dollar price from its 1993 low point, according to estimates by the World
Gold Council.
The council is a promotional organisation funded by gold producers. Markets
monitored for its quarterly demand trends survey account for about 75 per
cent of world demand for gold in the form of bars, coins and jewellery.
There was an 18 per cent drop in demand between the first quarter of this
year - the gold price fell to a seven-year low in the first quarter - and
the second quarter, from 700.1 tonnes to 575.3 tonnes.
Mr Bryan Parker, strategic planning manager for the council, suggested that,
as gold demand was seasonal, the better comparison was with last year's
second quarter.
The council says that while the dollar gold price rose during the second
quarter there were signs of a slowing of demand growth in the
price-sensitive Middle East and India markets.
Imports to key areas such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Dubai, used as
staging points for gold smuggled into countries where imports are banned,
were also significantly below those in the second quarter of 1992.
Higher prices encouraged gold producers to stop selling forward so much
metal and to unwind hedging positions. The council estimated that this
resulted in about 500,000 troy ounces (15.5 tonnes) of gold being withdrawn
from the market.
In the developed markets, purchases of gold by jewellery makers fell by 5
per cent or 7.6 tonnes compared with the second quarter of 1992, to 147
tonnes. Increased demand in the US and France was more than offset by a fall
in Japan, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece.
There was a 32 per cent rise in sales of gold bullion coins, however, to
12.8 tonnes, mainly in North America and Europe, which the council suggested
was an indication of a revival of interest in gold among western investors.
Gold demand in the first half of this year was 12 per cent up at 1,275.4
tonnes compared with the same months of 1992, the council said. There was a
24 per cent rise in the first quarter.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FT set to launch expanded mines
index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Financial Times early this autumn will replace its present gold mines
index, which is based on the performance of South African companies only,
with one enlarged to include Australian and North American gold producers.
Regional indices covering the three geographic areas will also be published.
Companies will be included in the world index if they:
Have sustainable annual gold production of at least 300,000 troy ounces;
Draw at least 75 per cent of revenue from the sale of mined gold;
Have at least 10 per cent of their issued capital available to the investing
public.
These conditions mean that there will be no set number of constituents and
the eligibility of each company will be reviewed four times a year.
The companies expected to be included initially account for about 30m ounces
of annual gold production or 50 per cent of western world output. They
include from Australia: Dominion Mining; Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie; Homestake
Gold Australia; Newcrest; Placer Pacific; Plutonic Resources; and Poseidon
Gold. Canadian companies include: American Barrick Resources; Cambior; Echo
Bay Mines; Hemlo Gold Mines; Lac Minerals; Pegasus Gold; Placer Dome; Royal
Oak Mines; and TVX Gold.
From South Africa there will be: Beatrix; Buffelsfontein; Driefontein;
Elandsrand; Freegold; Harmony; Hartebeestfontein; Kinross; Kloof;
Randfontein; Southvaal; Vaal Reefs; Western Areas; Western Deep Levels; and
Winkelhaak. US mines in the new index will be Battle Mountain Gold;
Homestake Mining; and Newmont Gold.
The method of calculating the index will be a sum of the market
capitalisations of the component companies, denominated in US dollars and
based at 1,000 on December 31 last year, when the gold price was Dollars 333
an ounce. Daily calculations will follow the close of business on the New
York and Toronto stock exchanges.

is forecast

<TEXT>
INDIA'S COFFEE output is set to rise 40 per cent to a record 225,000 tonnes
in crop year 1993-94 (October-September), which planters fear could cause a
glut, reports Reuter from Bombay.
In its 'blossoms estimate' for the new season, the state-run Coffee Board
put production at 101,000 tonnes of arabica and 124,000 tonnes of robusta
for the year, against this year's 79,300 and 82,000 tonnes respectively.
'The weather has been very good in most coffee-growing areas,' a United
Planters' Association of Southern India official said. He explained that the
coffee crop did well in alternate years. In 1991-92, output was 180,000
tonnes.
India has been exporting coffee freely after the collapse in 1989 of
International Coffee Agreement controls.
'There'll be a large surplus in the coming season,' said Mr Anil Bhandari, a
Coffee Board member and a planter from the southern state of Karnataka,
which accounts for the bulk of India's coffee.
In the first three months of the 1993-94 fiscal year (April-March) exports
fell to 17,614 tonnes, worth Rs659m (Pounds 14m) from 18,679 tonnes in the
same period of the previous year.
The government has fixed an annual export target of 120,000 tonnes, in spite
of only selling 113,150 tonnes in 1992-93, worth Rs3.79bn.
Mr Bhandari said world coffee prices had begun to look up and were again an
incentive for India to step up exports. 'In this changed scenario, I think
we can easily export the targeted 120,000 tonnes,' he said.
But analysts have observed that stagnating domestic consumption at 60,000
tonnes will not help India reduce surpluses.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spice suppliers try to pep up
market - Grenada and Indonesia discuss new targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S two leading nutmeg producers, Grenada and Indonesia, are trying
to find common ground on which they can control supply and strengthen the
world market for the spice.
Recent efforts to lift prices have included destroying stocks.
The latest move is being pushed by Grenada, which produces about a quarter
of world output, and whose economy is more heavily reliant on nutmeg than
Indonesia's, which accounts for virtually all the other 75 per cent.
The destruction of several hundred tonnes of stock by the countries followed
a progressive price decline since their cartel, created in 1989, collapsed.
'We have been speaking with the Indonesians about the state of the market,'
says Mr Nicholas Brathwaite, the prime minister of Grenada.
'I do not think that we will get another formal pact, but we are hoping that
we will be able to reach an agreement whereby we will be able to do
something about the supplies to the market,' he says.
Indonesian industry officials confirm that delegations have been visiting
Grenada for discussions on how best the producers can co-operate to improve
prices. They say, however, that the Indonesian industry will not again be
party to a cartel that attempts to set prices.
'We have explained this to our Grenadian counterparts, and they have told us
that they also are not interested in resurrecting the earlier agreement,'
says one official. 'What we are doing now is discussing how we can
co-operate in the international marketing of the product in the interest of
both countries.'
Neither Grenada nor Indonesia are willing to say specifically how the new
arrangement will work, and the extent of any likely cuts in nutmeg supplies.
It appears, however, that if they do reach an agreement, they will aim at
supplying the market with 9,500 tonnes a year, 500 tonnes less than current
world demand and 2,500 tonnes less than the current combined production of
both countries.
The cartel collapsed following extensive deregulation of the Indonesian
economy. Before it was established, the world price for nutmeg was about
Dollars 1,000 a tonne.
When the cartel became operative the Indonesian producers undertook to sell
their high quality nutmeg between Dollars 6,800 and Dollars 7,000 a tonne,
while low quality supplies were to be sold between Dollars 1,000 and Dollars
1,200 a tonne.
The Grenadians had committed themselves to a minimum price of Dollars 6,650
a tonne for their best nutmeg, with a minimum price for poorer quality
nutmeg was Dollars 5,575 a tonne.
Prices have since fallen as low as Dollars 550 a tonne and have generally
been below Dollars 1,000 a tonne.
The price collapse has been particularly painful to Grenada for which nutmeg
is the main commodity export. Grenada's earnings from nutmeg exports fell
from Dollars 18.1m in 1989 to Dollars 4.5m last year.
'In 1989 our farmers received ECDollars 12m (USDollars 4.5m) in bonus
payments because of the prices which we obtained then,' says Mr Brathwaite.
'Last year there was no bonus for the farmers because the price has fallen.
So we are in a very difficult situation.'
It remains to be seen whether the new targets for market supplies will
include the 3,500 tonnes that Grenada has agreed to ship to JHB, a Belgian
company, over five years, mainly for sale to China.
Any new agreement with Indonesia will 'complement' the marketing agreement
with JHB, Grenadian officials say.
The contract will also allow an increase in supplies of the Grenadian spice
to the US market, in which Indonesia is dominant.
JHB is to brand the product and will take more than the contracted 3,500
tonnes if the Chinese market performs well.
The eastern Caribbean island's dependence on foreign earnings from the spice
lies behind its need for higher prices. The Indonesians are more able to
tolerate lower world prices because their production costs are lower than
Grenada's.
Traditionally the market has been willing to pay more for the Grenadian
product because the quality was higher. But in seeking the co-operation of
the Indonesians, this is not a factor that Mr Brathwaite considers
important.
'The purchasers of nutmeg do not usually note that the Grenadian product is
of a higher quality,' the prime minister says. 'The quality does not
determine the price on the world market.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures rise higher as
options cover increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE FUTURES prices on the London Commodity Exchange surged still higher
yesterday in a continuation of what some analysts were coming to regard as a
self-perpetuating rally.
The December robustas position touched Dollars 1,180 a tonne at one stage,
before closing at Dollars 1,157 a tonne, up Dollars 32 on the day, Dollars
119 on the week so far and Dollars 338 from the low reached just four months
ago.
In the absence of fresh fundamental news coffee analysts pointed to options
covering in a thin market as the most likely explanation for the latest
gains.
Increased confidence in Latin American producers' ability to make their
export retention scheme work - and perhaps to persuade African producing
countries to join in this market support effort - has given the market a
firmer base in recent weeks. This week's initial jump to 2 1/2 -year highs
was prompted by reports of a cold front threatening frost damage to crops in
the south of Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer.
Those factors were still providing underlying support, said Mr Lawrence
Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London trading house. But there was 'one main
reason' for the continuing uptrend, and that was options covering, he said.
He explained that increasing numbers of call (buying) options had been put
'in the money' by the recent rise and the options' granters were being
forced to cover potential losses by buying futures contracts at an
accelerating rate.
In view of the low level of trading volume at present these covering
purchases were having an exaggerated effect on prices, pushing more options
into the money and forcing more covering by the granters, he added.
Mr Eagles noted that there were large open positions for call options at
Dollars 1,100 and Dollars 1,200 a tonne.
He suggested that there was also an element of catching up with the US
market in this week's sharp rise.
Coffee prices at New Yorks' Cocoa, Sugar and Coffee Exchange - where Latin
American-style arabica coffee is trade, rather than the mainly African
robustas traded in London - had been quicker to react to the possibility of
frost in Brazil and nearby positions rose by about 5.5 per cent last week,
compared with 4.5 per cent for London contracts.
In the first three days of this week, however, the 9.9 per cent rise for the
LCE's September position outdistanced the 2 per cent advance in CSCE's
corresponding contract.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Drop in gold price sparks demand for
long-dated Treasuries

SHARP declines in gold prices sparked heavy buying at the long end of the US
bond market yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 107
25/32 , yielding 6.525 per cent, close to its all-time low. At the short end
of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 100 1/4 , to yield 4.101
per cent.
Although still nervous about the possibility that President Bill Clinton's
first budget package will fail to pass through Congress, Treasury investors
were encouraged yesterday by big declines in gold prices. Earlier this year
gold prices had risen on revived fears of inflation, but recent inflation
data have calmed those fears, leading to some selling of gold.
Yesterday, the Comex gold price dropped more than Dollars 20 to under
Dollars 400, and the sharp decline spurred immediate buying of longer-dated
government securities, and helped offset the unexpectedly large 60,000
decline in weekly jobless claims, a figure that normally would have
unsettled the bond market.
Later in the day, the market received an extra boost from Mr David Mullins,
the Federal Reserve vice-chairman, who said that the president's budget
would slow economic growth, in spite of low interest rates.
UK government bonds gained almost half a point at the long end on strong
investor demand. Both overseas and domestic investors have been snapping up
gilts and Eurosterling paper, attracted by the relatively high yields and
the low inflation background.
Index-linked gilts continued to perform well, gaining over half a point
yesterday. Short-dated conventional gilts held up well although dealers
noted some disappointment at the lack of a base rate cut. The September gilt
futures contract on Liffe traded at 110.23 by late afternoon, up 11/32 from
Wednesday's close, on volume of 41,086 contracts.
EUROPEAN government bond markets wilted or showed only modest gains
yesterday as the interest rate cuts which many had hoped would sweep across
the continent in the wake of the ERM's weekend revamp proved rather more
elusive.
Ecu bonds rallied, and dealers said the actual yield spread over the
theoretical yield continued to narrow from around 25 basis points at the
start of the week to around zero yesterday.
SWEDEN'S central bank snipped 25 basis points off its marginal lending rate
to 8.25 per cent, boosting the treasury bill sector but leaving longer-dated
issues uninspired.
'The market had been discounting a bigger cut - while it was disappointed by
the size, it was pleasantly surprised by the timing,' said one dealer.
Two-year notes ended unchanged with a yield of 6.82/6.79 per cent.
Elsewhere in Scandinavia, the Danish government bond market plummeted,
losing nearly a point at the long end as the central bank held its repo rate
at 11 per cent. 'Short rates are ridiculously high, and it's making the bond
market very illiquid,' complained one dealer.
SHORT-DATED French government bonds weakened on disappointment that the
central bank left its key interest rates unchanged again.
However, Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland Global
Markets, said she expected interest rates to fall at Monday's repo,
predicting that the 10 per cent, 24-hour rate would be replaced by the
five-to-10-day rate of 7.75 per cent.
There was some good news in the form of a well-received FFr19.1bn auction of
10-year and 30-year bonds. The average yield on 10-year OATs at auction fell
to 6.46 per cent from 6.72 per cent a month ago, while the average yield on
the 30-year bond fell to 7.19 per cent from 7.61 per cent at the previous
auction.
GERMANY saw lively trade with the bund futures contract ending the day
firmer. The Liffe contract opened at 96.89 and reached a high of 97.08
before ending at around 97.00.

FT  06 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Bonds find home in
Indonesia's finance family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S bond market has often been regarded by investors as the Jakarta
stock market's poor relative.
Last year, however, companies raised more finance through bonds than through
equity issues, and an active secondary market is emerging.
Until 1990, most bond issues were valued at less than Rp50bn (Dollars 24m),
carried fixed interest rates, and were bought primarily by state pension
funds which held them until maturity.
A 1991 hike in interest rates prompted companies to consider alternative
ways of raising finance. The need has become more acute with banks
restricting new credit as they grapple with non-performing debt.
The market received a boost last October when PLN, the state electricity
company, issued a five-year Rp300bn bond worth more than all the bonds
issued in 1991. The company plans a further Rp600bn to Rp900bn issue by the
end of this year.
Banks have also started issuing bonds to increase their tier-two capital to
meet new capital requirements, raising more than Rp900bn in the last year.
And, for the first time, private companies regard bonds as attractive
financing instruments. Indah Kiat, a leading pulp and paper company, and
Citra Marga, a road construction company, for example, are preparing issues
of Rp150bn and Rp275bn respectively.
Since early 1991, most issues have carried a maturity of five years with a
six-month fixed interest period, before floating at 100 to 150 basis points
above the average of the state banks' deposit rates. Bonds are a
considerably cheaper source of funds than the banks, which maintain a spread
of up 700 basis points between deposit and lending rates.
'The bond market has been expanding exponentially,' says Mr Karl Bohn,
director of Sigma Batara Securities, who estimates the market's
capitalisation has grown by Dollars 850m to about Dollars 2bn in the last
year and will increase by a further Dollars 750m in the next six months.
Brokers have seen increasing foreign interest in Indonesian bonds. There is
no restriction on foreign ownership of bonds. But on the stock market
foreigners are limited to 49 per cent of a company's listed shares.
Most bonds carry annual interest rates of about 15 per cent. Even given the
likelihood of currency depreciation the bonds offer an attractive rate of
return relative to main currency deposit accounts.
Mr Steve Kenny, senior technical adviser at Niaga Securities, anticipates a
situation where a 'foreign investment bank will take a large share of an
issue, such as PLN, and then place it with offshore investors'.
Bapepam, which regulates the capital markets, has responded to the
heightened interest in bonds with a campaign to boost secondary market
trading.
Brokers estimate secondary market activity has grown from almost zero in the
middle of last year to about Rp75bn a month. Trade is conducted almost
entirely off-market, allowing traders to avoid the official transaction fee
and capital gains tax.
Bapepam is holding talks with brokers - about 10 houses are actively dealing
in bonds - on the market's structure and whether trade should be conducted
over-the-counter or via a trading floor.
Brokers are also campaigning for a central clearing house which would
provide safeguards against possible fraud - all bonds are issued as bearer
bonds.
Despite some problems the momentum of the market is unlikely to be slowed. A
new law requiring companies to set up pension funds should, for instance,
increase demand for bonds.
Banks have been eager buyers of bonds: Awash with deposits but afraid to
lend, bonds have provided them with a low risk means of making a return on
their funds.

FT  06 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark raises record Pounds 1.2bn in
sterling Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK yesterday raised a record Pounds 1.2bn in the sterling Eurobond
market to replenish its currency reserves following heavy intervention in
the foreign exchange market to support the Danish krone in July.
The financing led to speculation that other European governments would also
need to raise funds to top up reserves. However, other borrowers may choose
to wait until the Autumn as their needs are not thought to be pressing.
Denmark's financing was split into two tranches: a Pounds 700m fixed-rate
issue, increased from an initial Pounds 500m, of 6 3/4 per cent five-year
bonds priced to yield 28 basis points more than the comparable gilt yield;
and a Pounds 500m offering of five-year floating rate notes paying interest
at  1/8 point below the three-month London interbank offered rate.
The financing was split because Denmark wanted to raise both fixed rate and
floating rate debt. In the event, it was cheaper for Denmark to tap both
markets rather than raise the whole amount in the fixed-rate market and swap
a portion into floating-rate funding.
The fixed-rate portion of the offering was considered fairly priced and sold
well, prompting an increase in size to Pounds 700m.
Dealers were relieved when the launch spread of 28 basis points over the
five-year gilt was announced, as there had been rumours that some banks were
bidding for the mandate at a spread of 25 basis points. The Pounds 500m
floating-rate tranche was less well received. The sub-Libor pricing was
considered ambitious for Denmark, and dealers said sales were slow.
The all-in cost for Denmark was about 3 basis points under Libor for the
floating-rate tranche. Lead-manager UBS accepted that the fixed-rate portion
proved more attractive, but added that joint lead-managers UBS and Warburg
had 'identified a home' for both portions of the offering.
However, some syndicate managers remained unimpressed by the floating rate
portion: 'I saw this financing as a carrot and stick combination,' said one.
The fixed-rate bonds tightened slightly to a spread of 27 basis points while
the floating-rate notes were bid below their fixed reoffer price of 99.725
at 99.65.
In the nascent dragon bond market - the south-east Asian foreign bond market
 -Abbey National Treasury Services became the first UK borrower and the
first bank to tap the market.
The Dollars 250m three-year deal was arranged by Goldman Sachs Asia and
Lehman Asia. The deal followed extensive road shows in south-east Asia to
introduce the Abbey National name.
In the Canadian bond market, three more borrowers launched four-year
Eurobonds priced over the three-year Canadian government bond benchmark,
which has the effect of boosting the yield spread. UBS Australia and Credit
Lyonnais each launched CDollars 150m offerings, while Credit Local de France
launched a CDollars 125m deal.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank launched a DM500m issue of 6 per
cent bonds due 1997 via Commerzbank.

FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: New head at Salomon bond arm
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that
Mr Dennis Keegan, co-head of its European operations, would be returning to
New York to take over the firm's US bond arbitrage department.
Mr Keegan, who has been with Salomon for 13 years, succeeds Mr Lawrence
Hillibrand, who is due to leave the firm at the end of this year. Salomon
said the two would run the department together for an unspecified
'transition period'.
Mr Keegan has had a previous foray into the highly complex, and highly
profitable, world of bond arbitrage. In 1988, he was appointed joint head of
fixed-income in London with special responsibility for arbitrage trading.
He takes over at a crucial time for Salomon. Several members of its bond
department have left this year, including Mr Eric Rosenfeld, former head of
bond trading.
When Mr Hillibrand announced his decision to leave the firm last month,
analysts expressed concern about the impact of his departure. Salomon's bond
arbitrage group uses complicated formulae to bet large amounts of capital on
discrepancies in the value of different securities, generating millions of
dollars of revenues for the firm. Mr Hillibrand was an extremely successful
trader, earning Dollars 23m in pay and bonuses during 1990 alone.
Salomon said Mr Stephen Posford would become sole head of the its European
operations.
Mr Walid Chammah resigned yesterday as head of fixed-income capital markets
at First Boston to join rival Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley. Mr
Chammah is the latest senior executive to leave First Boston, the US arm of
the global investment banking group CS First Boston.

reservations

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Airlines International has made a desperate plea for its
arch-rival, Air Canada, to sanction its withdrawal from a computerised
reservations network in which both airlines are shareholders.
The plea comes amid signs that time is running out for Canadian in its
efforts to complete a far-reaching alliance with American Airlines.
The deal is conditional on Canadian pulling out of the Gemini reservations
system, and joining American's Sabre network. Canadian has warned that
failure to cement the American deal before the end of the year would mean
almost certain bankruptcy.
Canada's director of competition policy yesterday asked the competition
tribunal to dissolve Gemini or to order Gemini to dispose of its core
'hosting' business, which handles airlines' internal seat management.
However, Canadian is concerned that the tribunal may not approve either of
these actions or, if it does, that the issue could remain bogged down in
appeals far beyond the year-end deadline for completion of the deal with
American.
The Calgary-based airline has offered Air Canada and Covia, a unit of United
Airlines, CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.5m) in compensation for its withdrawal
from Gemini.
Air Canada, which favours a merger of the two domestic airlines, has so far
refused to sanction a break-up of Gemini's ownership.

SHARPLY higher profits are reported by George Weston, the Toronto-based food
group, Reuter reports from Toronto. Second-quarter earnings increased from
CDollars 3.8m, or 3 cents a share, to CDollars 18.3m, or 39 cents, on
revenues of CDollars 2.79bn against CDollars 2.69bn.
The 1992 results included special provisions of CDollars 15m, equal to 22
cents a share, for Loblaw Cos' investment in a US subsidiary sold in 1988.
First-quarter earnings of Molson Cos, the diversified Canadian group, fell
to CDollars 36.7m or 62 cents a share from CDollars 38.4m or 66 cents a year
ago on revenues of CDollars 772m, down from CDollars 799m.
The group said the profits fall reflected a lower brewing contribution from
to its reduced stake in Molson Breweries, held 40 per cent by Molson Cos, 40
per cent by Australia's Foster's Brewing Group and 20 per cent by Philip
Morris of the US.

R281m

<TEXT>
RUSTENBURG Platinum, the world's largest producer, suffered a 30 per cent
fall in earnings to R281m (Dollars 78m) from R402m in the year to June and
cut its dividend by 28 per cent to 165 cents a share from 230 cents.
The decline followed a poor first half and a substantial improvement in
second-half earnings, which rose by 55.6 per cent to R171.3m from R110.1m in
the first half.
The improvement was the result of an average 20 per cent increase in the
volume of sales of the main platinum group metals - platinum, palladium and
rhodium - and nickel.
Although US prices were mixed - palladium up by 23.1 per cent and rhodium
down by 42.6 per cent - the net effect was to increase sales for the second
half by 10 per cent to R1.55bn, against R1.41bn, giving total sales for the
year of R2.97bn, against R2.91bn.
Earnings fell 30 per cent for the year primarily because of the sharp falls
in the rhodium and nickel prices, with the result that revenues were broadly
unchanged despite increases in volumes.
The rhodium price averaged Dollars 1,807 an oz, compared to Dollars 2,683 in
1992, while the nickel price fell to Dollars 2.84 a lb from Dollars 3.46 in
1992.
Unit production costs rose by only 5.8 per cent, well below inflation.
Of the other two platinum producers in the Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment group, Lebowa Platinum improved substantially to record a R0.5m
loss, compared with a R9.4m loss in the first half.
Potgietersrust Platinum, the developing mine, should achieve its production
target of 200,000 tonnes a month within the next two months. The final
capital cost of the mine will be R385m, against initial estimates of R555m.

CPC International, the US food company whose brands range from Knorr soups
to Hellman's mayonnaise, is buying an 85 per cent interest in Pfanni-Werke
Otto Eckart, a German potato products producer, for an undisclosed sum,
writes Nikki Tait.
Pfanni makes a range of potato-based goods. The company has three plants in
Germany and one in Poland, and annual sales stand at about Dollars 220m.
Some of the products are also exported to the US, where they are sold under
the Pfanni name.
CPC said yesterday it saw considerable scope for extending the Pfanni brand,
and expected to develop the business 'aggressively'.
RJR Nabisco Holdings is expected to issue 30m shares of Dollars 25 Series B
cumulative preferred stock totalling Dollars 750m next week, according to
underwriter Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Reuter reports from New York.
Merrill Lynch said the expected price for the preferred stock offering was 9
1/4 per cent.
The issue is rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-plus by Standard
and Poor's, the international ratings agencies.
Net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock offering will be used for
general corporate purposes, RJR said.
RJR Nabisco Holdings currently has about Dollars 14bn of debt outstanding
from the Dollars 29bn of debt incurred in the biggest leveraged buy-out ever
in 1989.
CAE, the Canadian flight-simulator builder, recorded first quarter profit of
CDollars 7.6m (USDollars 5.9m), or 7 cents a share, up 34 per cent from
CDollars 5.7m, or 5 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 253m,
against CDollars 240m, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The group said the
commercial aircraft simulator and defence markets remained weak.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Amic pre-tax down 5% at halfway
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Industrial Corporation (Amic) suffered a 5 per cent decline
to R227m (Dollars 67.6m) in pre-tax income from R239m at the halfway stage
as depressed trading conditions took their toll.
But Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said there were clear signs that the South
African economy had bottomed out, and he predicted improved earnings in the
second half.
The dividend was maintained at 110 cents a share on per-share earnings
which, including an abnormal credit, rose by 16 per cent to 327 cents from
281 cents.
Turnover at Amic, the industrial arm of the Anglo American group, rose by 18
per cent to R3.86bn, against R3.28bn, but the increase from continuing
operations was only 3 per cent. Earnings from operations fell to R153m from
R170m, largely because of lower earnings at Mondi and Boart, two of Amic's
unlisted subsidiaries.
Mr Boyd said the group restructuring plans were 'fairly well down the road'
and should be completed by the beginning of 1994. The aim was to improve
Amic's borrowing and tax efficiency.
Amic yesterday, for the first time, gave a more detailed presentation on its
main unlisted activities - Mondi, Boart and Scaw Metals.
Attributable earnings at Mondi fell from R172m in 1989 to R51m in 1992.
Over the same period, Boart's earnings fell from R100m to R47m, and were
R12m in the first half of 1993.

<TEXT>
LARGE US retailers yesterday reported widely differing sales patterns during
July, suggesting that recovery in the stores sector remains patchy and
subject to promotional activity and regional trends.
One of the best performers was Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based department
store group, which recorded a 15.4 per cent improvement in domestic
same-store sales last month.
Mr Arthur Martinez, the merchandise group's chairman, said the gain had been
'broadly-based', with noticeably strong results from clothing lines and some
'hardlines', especially tyres.
The heatwave which has engulfed parts of the US for the past month had
produced double-digit sales of air conditioners, while Sears was also seeing
an increase in demand for repairs and services from consumers in flooded
areas of the Mid-west.
Kmart, the discount store and specialty retailer which this week disclosed
it was considering the sale of its PayLess drug store chain, also notched up
a much-improved performance last month.
Same-store sales growth reached 3.7 per cent overall, and the domestic
general merchandise side registered a 6.3 per cent advance.
This compared with 1.4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively for the first
six months of the financial year.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said the company was 'particularly encouraged
by the continuing strength in our hardline merchandise categories', although
he admitted the increase in clothing sales had been more modest.
Also faring fairly well last month were Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's
top-selling retailer, which posted a 9 per cent same-store sales gain in
July, and May Department Stores, which saw a 7.1 per cent same-store sales
advance in its main department store division.
Among specialist retailers, The Limited posted an 8 per cent increase in
comparable store sales, while several electronic goods retailers - such as
Tandy and Circuit City - also reported significant advances.
But a handful of retail groups told a less encouraging story.
Woolworth, for example, saw domestic comparable store sales fall by 3.3 per
cent in July, while JC Penney reported a 3.1 per cent decline in its
mainline stores.
The latter said sales in its children's and home divisions had been affected
by the moving of promotional events from July 1992 to August this year.
Federated Department Stores, which takes in chains such as Bloomingdale's
and The Bon Marche, saw a 0.2 per cent decline in same-store sales last
month.
Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, blamed inadequate stocks, plus some planned
August promotional activity, for the disappointing returns.
But he added that the July figures 'should have no bearing on our business
or our performance expectations for the remainder of the year'.

<TEXT>
NIPPONDENSO, the component-making affiliate of Toyota, the Japanese vehicle
group, suffered a 10.4 per cent fall in first-half profits to Y27.27bn
(Dollars 257.3m) before tax, as Japanese demand remained weak and margins
were kept under pressure.
Parent company sales were down 4.1 per cent to Y654.2bn. All product groups
were affected, although electronic parts and control equipment held up best.
In Japan, Nippondenso, which has operations in several other countries,
sells primarily to Toyota, which owns 23.5 per cent of the company.
However, in recent years Nippondenso, the biggest company in the sector, has
widened its customer range to include all domestic carmakers except Nissan -
and even there has established an indirect tie-up.
Operating profits were down 8.2 per cent at Y20.74bn, and the company, which
has large cash deposits, said a fall of some Y1.8bn in other income
reflected lower interest rates.
From net earnings per share of Y15.70, against Y21.28, it is paying an
unchanged interim dividend of Y7.
For the full year to December, the company projected pre-tax profits down
19.3 per cent to Y53bn on sales 4.2 per cent lower at Y1,300bn.
Yokohama Rubber, Japan's second-largest tyremaker, saw pre-tax profits fall
29.7 per cent in the half-year to June to Y3.63bn, on sales down 7.9 per
cent to Y127.2bn.
It blamed the impact on exports of the stronger yen, as well as the drop in
car production.
The company projected full-year profits down 16 per cent to Y10bn before
tax, on a 5.9 per cent drop in revenues to Y270bn. It is maintaining an
interim dividend of Y3.50, but said it had yet to decide on the final
payout, previously Y4.50.

<TEXT>
TRANS-NATAL Coal of South Africa yesterday warned that with no sign of a
major upturn in world spot prices for coal it did not expect to maintain
last year's after-tax income in the current financial year, Reuter reports
from Johannesburg.
'With no upturn in prices, there's going to a tough year ahead of us,' said
Mr Dave Murray, managing director.
In line with expectations, the country's biggest coal exporter maintained
the full-year dividend at 80 cents a share on a fall in per-share earnings
to 144.9 cents, from 180.2 cents previously, before an extraordinary cost of
R17m.
After-tax income fell to R115.5m (Dollars 34.4m) from R143.6m in the
previous year.
Mr Murray said that despite increased sales and cost controls, earnings were
still being hit by low spot and contract prices for steam coal exports,
particularly in Europe.

Dollars 575m for year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
QUAKER OATS, the Chicago-based cereals, pet foods and beverage company, said
yesterday that earnings per share in the year to end-June rose by an
underlying 31 per cent to Dollars 4.25, excluding the effects of adopting
new accounting standards, restructuring charges and gains on assets sales.
At the operating level, Quaker saw profits rise from Dollars 540.2m to
Dollars 575.2m, a more modest 6.5 per cent advance, with sales increasing by
2.8 per cent at Dollars 5.73bn.
However, with accounting-related and restructuring charges excluded, and
gains from asset sales omitted, operating profits would have improved by 13
per cent.
In the final three months of the year alone, Quaker recorded operating
profits of Dollars 180m, down by 15.1 per cent over the previous year.
Sales reached Dollars 1.54bn, little changed from the levels achieved 12
months previously.
The company said that the decline in fourth-quarter operating profits was
largely due to increased advertising and merchandising expenditures across
most of its important product categories.
Quaker also announced that its board had authorised the buy-back of up to 5m
shares. The company recently completed a 3m share buy-back programme,
authorised in January 1993.

flotation of regional railway

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST JAPAN Railway, one of Japan's seven state-owned regional railway
companies, will start accepting bids today for its share auction ahead of a
public offering in October.
The government was last year forced to postpone JR East's flotation because
of the plunging Tokyo stock market.
Stockbrokers and the ministry of finance are hoping that the listing will
bring back confidence among individual investors, who have been
disillusioned by the fall in the share price of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which is part-owned by the government.
The auction procedure is an attempt by the government, which faced mounting
criticism over the initial high pricing of the NTT offer, to keep the offer
price of JR East at a reasonable level.
NTT shares, offered publicly in 1986 at Y1.197m, soared to Y3.18m the
following year. However, the stock fell to an all-time low of Y453,000 last
August, prompting criticism that it was offered at an inflated price by the
government.
The outcome of the JR East listing will affect the timing of that of other
government-owned companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining six
railway groups.
The government also intends to float the remaining 65.7 per cent stake that
it holds in NTT.
Half of the 4m shares owned by JNR Settlement, which holds debts and shares
of Japan National Railways, the former national railway operator, will be
offered in the first tranche.
JNR Settlement will auction 600,000 shares, and will fix a price for the
remaining 1.4m shares based on an weighted average of the auction bids.
Investors, including foreigners and individuals, may take part in the
auction by submitting bids for a minimum of 50 shares by August 11.
Successful bids will be decided on August 26, and the initial public
offering price fixed on August 30.

Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company which is in the throes of
restructuring, prompted a wave of speculation on Wall Street yesterday when
it announced that it would make a significant announcement this morning,
writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The company declined to elaborate on the announcement, but some analysts
believed that Kodak could be poised to name a new finance director. The
former chief financial officer, Mr Christopher Steffen, quit in April after
only 11 weeks with the company, because of a management disagreement with
Kodak's chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceutical and agrochemicals company,
yesterday announced a 3 per cent profit increase for the first six months of
the year.
In spite of restructuring costs, the company expects this year's earnings to
match those for 1992.
Group sales fell by 1.7 per cent to DM2.87bn (Dollars 1.7bn) from last
year's comparative DM2.82bn. The lower turnover was partly affected by the
appreciation of other European currencies against the D-Mark, as well as
sales of operations shed by the company over the past year.
As expected, domestic sales in the pharmaceutical sector continued to be
depressed because of recent government health reforms which include a new
pricing system for medicines. Domestic sales rose 1 per cent to DM1.99bn.
Foreign sales increased to DM2.32bn from DM2.30bn.
The sharp decline in sales in the agrochemical sector, which fell 22 per
cent during the first quarter of this year, has slowed down. For the first
six months of this year, they fell 8.2 per cent to DM786m, compared with the
same period last year.
Schering announced that its shareholders would vote on December 15 for the
planned merger of its agrochemical division with Hoeschst, the country's
large chemical group.

<TEXT>
ZURICH Insurance Group has been holding talks with Commerzbank over the
possible purchase of a large minority stake in a German insurance concern
with premium income of some DM3bn (Dollars 1.8m).
Commerzbank owns a 48 per cent stake in Deutsche Beamtenversicherung (DBV),
the subject of the talks.
However, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive, said earlier
this year it intended to reduce this to 25 per cent.
The bank, one of Germany's largest, would neither confirm nor deny talks
with the Swiss group.
Zurich, which has made clear its desire to expand in Germany, confirmed
talks, but gave no details.
Mr Kohlhaussen has indicated that a foreign partner for Wiesbaden-based DBV,
quoted on the Frankfurt stock market, would be desirable to help the
expansion of the business.
Such a move would also give Zurich, which has a branch in Frankfurt and owns
the Agrippina insurance in Cologne, greater access to the German market.
No price has been mentioned. Zurich said a valuation of DBV was under way.
DBV is valued at some DM2bn on the stock market, but its DM3bn volume of
premium income means the stake sought by Zurich could be worth about DM700m.
A deal with Zurich Insurance would fit in with Commerzbank's strategy of
developing its Allfinanz (financial services) activities through
partnerships rather than outright ownership.
Its links with DBV and Leonberger Bausparkasse, a mortgage savings and loan
company in which it owns 40 per cent, have added considerably to its overall
business.

 -Ian Rodger looks at Creditanstalt's planned sale of industrial holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Austria were a big industrial power, the US government and the European
Commission would have long since forced it to unwind the tight connections
between its two top banks and the country's leading industrial companies.
More than in Germany, more even than in Japan, the financial-industrial
networks in Austria are astonishingly close knit.
However, this week's announcement by Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the country's
second-largest banking group, that it intended to sell off most of its
industrial holdings indicates that change is at last on the way.
Bank Austria, the country's other large banking group, has said that it
would streamline its large industrial holdings.
In fact, Bank Austria has been adding to its holdings, taking over this year
much of the large investment portfolio of Wiener Holding, a sprawling
conglomerate which, like Bank Austria, is controlled by the city of Vienna.
Even before that move, Bank Austria's industrial portfolio was impressive.
Last year, the industrial companies that it controlled either through
majority or large minority share stakes had combined turnover of Sch33.4bn
(Dollars 12.8m), cash-flow of Sch1.7bn, and employed nearly 21,000 people.
Among its holdings were large stakes in the leading construction groups
Bauwesen and A. Porr; AKG, the specialist electronic equipment maker; the
Lenzing textile group; the Perlmooser cement group and the JM Voith turbine
and paper machine maker.
For its part, Creditanstalt boasts a 74.3 per cent stake in Semperit, the
tyremaker; 71.2 per cent of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the motor group; 72.5 per
cent of Treibacher Chemische Werke; 63.8 per cent of Universale-Bau, the
construction group; and 59.4 per cent of Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the
building materials group, among other things.
These holdings are, to a large extent, the result of Austria's unusual
industrial development. Until the collapse of the imperial government in
1919, entrepreneurship was largely sponsored by the banks. After the second
world war circumstances favoured the banks. The Russians were determined
that industrial companies would not fall back into Nazi hands, and so tended
to allow only the government and government-controlled banks to buy them up.
(The Austrian government holds 75 per cent of the votes in Creditanstalt.)
Thus, the main commercial banks, Creditanstalt and Landerbank, which merged
with a savings bank group to become Bank Austria two years ago, became,
along with the state and city governments, the main owners of industry.
For a long time, this fitted comfortably with the tight social partnership
that guided Austrian political and economic life. The banks were important
vehicles for ensuring that jobs at all levels and contracts of all sizes
could be shared fairly among the Blacks (conservatives) and the Reds
(socialists).
The portfolios were useful in providing the banks with a steadily growing
store of hidden reserves. Under Austrian accounting procedures, equity
holdings can be stated in the balance sheet at cost.
Outside estimates put Creditanstalt's hidden reserves on its industrial
portfolio at about Sch4bn while those of Bank Austria may be worth Sch6bn.
However, in recent years, not only has the social partnership been coming
under strain, so have the banks.
Burdened with heavy losses following ill-fated international expansion in
the 1980s, Creditanstalt and Bank Austria have had to realise profits on
their industrial holdings to balance their books.
For example, at the end of 1991, Creditanstalt sold its stakes in three
Austrian brewers for Sch1.5bn. Last year, it covered much of its Sch5.7bn in
provisions by crystallising the capital gains on its controlling stake in
Wienerberger.
This was done in a curious Austrian way by selling it to a subsidiary. A
change in accounting law will soon outlaw this rather murky process which
allows the bank to have its cake and eat it, too.
Analysts in Vienna say that by the end of next year Bank Austria may well
have had to crystallise the capital gains on all its industrial holdings to
cover the costs of its merger and bad loans.
Meanwhile, the capital market environment has changed. Both banks actively
promote their shares to international investors, but they are finding that
portfolio managers in the UK and the US do not like banks having large
industrial holdings.
Creditanstalt has seen the writing on the wall, and has declared that it
will run down its industrial portfolio over the next few years.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, the chairman, says the bank will probably still
hold on to minority positions in companies with which it has a strong
commercial relationships. 'We will be a nearly pure bank, although perhaps
not as pure as a UK clearer,' he said on Tuesday.
Bank Austria's policy is less clear. Privately, directors indicate that the
bank will gradually sell off the portfolio, but publicly they have to be
sensitive to the socialist leanings of their main shareholder and so they
say they will only streamline or optimise their holdings.

FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Vard losses widen to NKr212m in
first half

<TEXT>
VARD, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday disclosed a
sharp deterioration in first-half pre-tax losses to NKr212.20m (Dollars
29.4m) from NKr124.54m last year.
The weaker performance is attributed to substantially higher interest
payments on debt and losses by the group's ferry operations. The company's
shares yesterday closed down NKr2.50 at NKr28.
Group revenue increased to NKr3.35bn from NKr2.69bn as operating expenses
widened to NKr2.97bn from NKr2.31bn. Operating profits fell to NKr161.63m
from NKr210.21m.
Net financial items for the six-month period rose to NKr373.83m from
NKr235.39m. The rise was largely due to an increase in net interest expenses
to NKr310.44m from NKr233.33m resulting from a financial restructuring of
Kloster Cruise in May when Dollars 300m in 10-year secured notes was issued
at a coupon of 13 per cent.
Kloster's half-year losses rose to NKr116.9m from NKr100.9m as increased
competition in European waters put pressure on summer prices.
Larvik Line, one of Vard's two ferry operations, plunged into a six-month
loss of NKr15.8m from profit of NKr11.2m last year, due to stagnation in
traffic between Norway and Denmark. Scandi Line, the other ferry operation,
also fell into a half-year loss of NKr3.1m against a profit of NKr1.7m, in
spite of an increase in passenger volume.
Mr Ketil Arvesen, analyst with Oslo-based Finanshuset, said the general
trend in domestic ferry traffic was weak but that Vard's troubles were
exacerbated by having to fill a bigger fleet.
Vard last month halted negotiations to dispose of ferry operations to a
group of investors led by Union Bank of Switzerland which offered NKr1.1bn
for the business.
Sparebanken Nor, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, yesterday
unveiled a sharp improvement in first-half net profit to NKr741m (Dollars
101.5m) from NKr3m last year. Group net interest income rose to NKr1.514bn
from NKr1.341bn as operating income increased to NKr2.66bn from NKr1.85bn,
helped by a sharp rise in securities gains to NKr575m from NKr77m.
Operating profit in the six-month period increased to NKr1.42bn from
NKr663m. First-half losses on loans and guarantees rose slightly to NKr651m
from NKr643m. The bank forecast a weaker second-half performance.

FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bechstein future rests on
property dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BECHSTEIN, one of the world's most famous piano makers, could be rescued
from bankruptcy if it can resolve a property haggle with Berlin's ruling
body.
The dispute centres on the status of property owned by Bechstein which the
city's senate has first option to buy-back.
Bechstein, which filed for bankruptcy on July 22, is in desperate need of
about DM40m (Dollars 23.5m). It is owed DM9m in outstanding payments. It has
recently paid 1.5m to its former staff after liquidating a small piano
company in Bavaria.
It cannot pay its staff in Berlin. Dresdner and Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, its house bankers, are unwilling to extend a DM3m to
DM4m credit line. And its turnover will plummet by DM5.5m-DM15m this year.
In 1988, Mr Karl Schulze, a master piano maker who bought Bechstein back
from the US Baldwin piano company, acquired a new site for his factory not
far from the western side of Checkpoint Charlie. The property was bought
from the senate for DM19.6m. Bechstein has today a small mortgage of DM2.5m.
But Bechstein is not free to sell the property to raise capital.
'The purchase contract states that in the event of re-sale of the property,
the senate has first option, and at a minimum price,' explained Mr Leo
Durici, Bechstein's sales manager. The senate is looking into the market
value of the property. Mr Durici said it might offer about DM40m.
One banker yesterday said this was a 'ludicrous price'. Bechstein is not in
a position to argue. Neither are the altruists in the senate in a position
to offer DM150m, particularly since Berlin is running an annual deficit of
over DM7bn.
The senate could rescue Bechstein by paying out DM40m and reap profits at a
later date. Or it could let Bechstein sell the property on the open market.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Cowie accelerates to Pounds 15.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the car leasing, motor trading, bus and tractor group, yesterday
reported a 28 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.1m
to Pounds 15.5m.
Turnover in the 6 months to June 30 rose to Pounds 393m (Pounds 323m),
including Pounds 44.6m attributable to the acquisition of the Keep Trust
motor group which was completed in May.
Earnings per share increased by 20 per cent to 8p (6.68p), based on a 33 per
cent tax charge, and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2p).
Sir Tom Cowie, who is retiring as chairman at the end of this year,
described the results as 'more than creditable.'
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said they reflected 'continued organic
growth and cost-saving innovations in our contract hire operations, together
with our acquisition of the Keep Trust motor dealership and strong
performances from our bus and coach divisions.'
However, there was a decline in operating profits to Pounds 28.7m (Pounds
31.5m) partly reflecting the impact of falling interest rates on the core
finance division where interest income fell by Pounds 4m. Keep Trust's 18
franchised dealerships contributed Pounds 831,000 to operating profits in
the period.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 13.2m, mainly reflecting
falling interest rates. Borrowings totalled Pounds 290m or 230 per cent of
shareholders' funds at the half year, down from Pounds 309m at end-December.
The group gave a further divisional breakdown of its profits at the pre-tax
level.
The vehicle leasing business increased profits 31 per cent to Pounds 10.7m
(Pounds 8.16m) on turnover of Pounds 117.6m (Pounds 124.8m). Yesterday Cowie
Interleasing announced the acquisition of the corporate fleet management
operations of FMM Group, a subsidiary of Commercial Union.
The expanded motor division, which now comprises 42 dealerships, ranking
Cowie as the fourth largest motor retail group in the UK, lifted profits to
Pounds 3.66m (Pounds 3.48m) on increased sales of Pounds 249.4m (Pounds
174.8m).
COMMENT
Even though Cowie's results were broadly in line with expectations the
market reacted unenthusiastically yesterday pushing the shares down from
267p to 256p. Some investors may have been surprised by the conservative tax
charge - unlikely to be as high at year end - and may have been expecting a
bigger fall in interest costs. Nevertheless, the leased fleet should
continue to grow in the second half and new car sales in August look good
and margins should improve when manufacturers incentives resume. Excluding
the second half exceptional Pounds 4.6m profit on the sale of the group's
Henlys shares last month, full-year pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 33m,
producing earnings of about 17.6p and a prospective p/e of 14.5. The shares
still rate a buy.

<TEXT>
TR CITY of London Trust lifted net asset value by 18.5 per cent, from 112.8p
to 133.64p per share, over the 12 months to June 30.
The return, including reinvestment of dividends, amounted to 23.3 per cent,
again outperforming the FT-A All-Share Index.
Reduced dividend income, especially from higher yielding equities, and lower
bank deposit interest received left net revenue at Pounds 9.02m (Pounds
9.26m) for earnings of 4.59p (4.76p) per share.
A fourth interim dividend of 1.23p brings the total for the year to 4.8p
(4.76p); directors anticipate a total of not less than 4.92p for the current
year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PICT Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production group, has sold
its equity stakes in three oil companies, Croft Oil &amp; Gas, Edinburgh Oil &amp;
Gas and Tullow Oil.
The total price realised of Pounds 1.44m was close to book value. The
company said the proceeds would be added to reserves.
The Edinburgh Oil and Tullow stakes were acquired in 1989 and 1990 as part
of the sale proceeds arising from Pict's withdrawal from onshore UK
exploration and production. The Croft shares were acquired in 1992 as part
payment for the sale of its interest in the Claymore field.
Pict has now sold all its equity interests in non-affiliated oil and gas
companies.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: British Alcan losses widen to Pounds 5.2m
as margins suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANCY COSTS and recession in most European markets resulted in
increased losses at British Alcan Aluminium in the first half of 1993.
Losses before tax rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 5.2m and Mr Douglas
Ritchie, chairman, said: 'The business situation remains depressing,
although there are signs of recovery in the UK economy which have yet to
translate into improved revenue.'
He said trading conditions remained difficult with volume sales and margins
under pressure, particularly in European Community markets which 'are now
experiencing severe recession.'
Reflecting problems in its main export markets, sales of semi-fabricated
products fell by nearly 6 per cent or 8,000 tonnes in the first half to
131,400 tonnes.
In spite of difficult trading conditions, the company continued to generate
cash, repay debt and improve its balance sheet.
In the half-year another Pounds 17.2m of debt was paid off and gearing
improved from 37 per cent to 35 per cent.
Turnover fell from Pounds 384.8m to Pounds 381.1m but operating profits rose
from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 8.7m. However, there was an exceptional charge of
Pounds 6m to cover re-organisation at the Rogerstone rolling mill, involving
246 job losses, and smaller numbers in Glasgow and Falkirk. In the first
half of last year re-organisation costs were only Pounds 500,000.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 7.9m. Tax was down from
Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.1m, leaving a net loss of Pounds 6.3m, compared with
Pounds 6.6m.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Jones Intercable raises Pounds 153m for
Leeds project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES Intercable of the US has raised Pounds 152.5m of equity and debt
finance to pay for the construction of a cable network in Leeds covering
290,000 homes and 19,000 businesses.
The deal, arranged by NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking
arm of National Westminster, is the first of its kind in the UK cable
industry involving both equity and non-recourse debt.
It comes two weeks after TeleWest, the UK's largest cable operator, raised a
Pounds 190m loan facility to fund its network construction.
Mr Garry Stephen, head of media and telecommunications at NatWest Markets,
said the financing underlined a new level of confidence in the cable
industry in the City.
'In the 1980s there was bad news about the industry. Now there is a flow of
good news about cable and people are being attracted to the industry,' he
said.
Equity investors, which will subscribe Pounds 77.5m of equity, include Jones
Intercable, which has 57 cable franchises in the US; Cable and Wireless;
PaineWebber; Chemical Venture Partners; Capital Cities/ABC; NatWest Ventures
and VEBA Immobilien, the German housing company.
Four UK institutions are also investing but declined to make their names
public.
The Pounds 75m syndicated loan has been underwritten by National Westminster
Bank, ABN Amro Bank and the Bank of Novia Scotia, which was also involved in
the TeleWest financing.
Mr Alan Bates, managing director of Jones Cable Group, said construction
would begin in February with the first customer expected to sign on in June
1994.
Both cable television services and telephony, through Mercury
Communications, will be offered.
Telephony is the fastest growing part of the cable business and it is the
dual stream of revenues from television and telephone services that is
attracting new investor interest.
Jones also plans to bring one of its US cable television channels, The
Computer Network, which teaches computing, to the UK.
Following the financing Jones, which holds franchises covering about 1m
homes in the UK, is likely to try to buy additional UK franchises.
By the beginning of June there 465,000 cable subscribers in the UK and 2.5m
homes were passed by cable networks giving a penetration rate, or ratio of
subscribers to those who could subscribe, of 21 per cent.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rotork advances 28% to Pounds 6.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Rotork rose 6p to 178p after the Bath-based valve control
manufacturer reported a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 6.2m in first half
pre-tax profits.
Sterling's devaluation helped to increase sales by 26 per cent, to Pounds
34m, in the six months to June 30.
The company said that although the strength of its order book indicated some
further improvement in the second half, when small acquisitions would be
contributing for the first time, general market weakness justified a note of
caution.
Rotork Actuation, which makes valves to open and close pipes, traded
strongly in the first half of the year, with record bookings and shipments.
The company said that while Actuation was enjoying unparalleled demand, many
of its markets were, paradoxically, under varying degrees of economic
pressure.
'Here depreciation of sterling has been a significant help in countering
savage pricing from major international competitors seeking to win back lost
market share.'
Rotork Instruments experienced good input for its emergency shutdown systems
in the first half despite generally low levels of capital commitment in the
UK.
Rotork Analysis, however, which supplies air monitoring equipment, found
orders hard to come by.
In May, Rotork acquired the Hallikainen range of refinery analysers for
Pounds 1.16m. Coupled with Hone, the group said that gave a sound base from
which the gas market could grow once economic and legislative conditions
improved.
Earnings per share advanced by 29 per cent from 3.5p to 4.5p.
The interim dividend is increased from an adjusted 1.55p to 1.75p.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: International alliance plans Pounds 200m
Yorkshire cable network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERALE des Eaux, the French diversified services group, is combining with
Singapore Telecom and Yorkshire Water to invest about Pounds 200m in a cable
system for Yorkshire.
The move is further evidence of the growing appeal to overseas investors of
UK cable TV and telephone franchises as operators building cable networks in
conurbations report high take-up rates for the new services. The two
overseas companies already have UK cable interests - Singapore Telecom with
an interest in two cable franchises and Generale des Eaux in nine, including
six in Yorkshire, operated as Yorkshire Cable by its General Cable
subsidiary.
Yorkshire Water, which is to put up about 10 per cent of the equity, is the
first of the privatised water companies to take a cable stake.
Its involvement marks a further advance by the privatised utilities into the
telecommunications market. National Grid is financing the construction of a
new national long-distance fibre-optic network using its pylons.
The Pounds 200m will be invested in Yorkshire Cable, which holds six
franchises in the county - Bradford, Barnsley, Doncaster &amp; Rotherham,
Halifax, Sheffield and Wakefield.
As yet, large-scale construction has taken place only in Bradford, where the
company reports a 30 per cent take-up of cable telephony in areas covered.
Between them, the franchises extend to more than 800,000 homes.
Singapore Telecom and Generale des Eaux will each take a 45 per cent stake
in the project, making an initial investment of about Pounds 80m. ST, due to
be partially privatised before the end of the year, is one of Singapore's
biggest and most profitable state run enterprises. In recent months it has
made significant investments overseas, with 14 ventures in 11 countries.
Mr Joe Delahunty, a director of General Cable, said Generale des Eaux was
anxious to form an alliance with an established telecommunications operator.
'We see Singapore Telecom as innovative and aggressive, and this was a
suitable opportunity,' he said. The three companies said they were attracted
by the 'unique British regulatory freedom' which allows operators to offer
both cable TV and telephone services over the same network.
Most of the investors in the UK cable industry are US telecommunications
companies forbidden by US regulatory constraints from offering entertainment
services in the US.
In the UK, BT is forbidden by the government from offering entertainment
services on the public telephone network.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Abbey ahead to IPounds 2.65m as dividend is
doubled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY, the residential estate developer, raised pre-tax profit from IPounds
1.55m to IPounds 2.65m (Pounds 2.49m) in the year ended April 30 1993,
despite an exceptional charge amounting to IPounds 1.15m.
Shareholders receive a dividend doubled to 2p, payable from earnings of
4.06p (2.7p) per share.
The charge covered two write downs - IPounds 630,000 at one housing
development and IPounds 519,000 on the valuation of an investment property.
Mr Charles Gallagher, chairman, said improving market conditions in the last
quarter led to the UK housebuilding side completing 508 sales with turnover
of IPounds 28.9m and operating profit of IPounds 2.8m.
The plant hire division suffered from the decline in overall construction
activity; it incurred a trading loss of IPounds 448,000 after the costs of
closing three depots.
In Ireland the Dun Laoghaire site had been sold and 28 plots purchased at
Monkstown.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Aspen shares tumble on setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Aspen Communications yesterday fell 50p to a low for the year of
145p on news of halved operating profits for the six months to end-June.
However, exceptional credits of Pounds 865,000 following the sale of its
commercial radio interests enabled the USM-quoted supplier of printing,
media and communications services to lift its pre-tax profits for the period
from Pounds 923,000 to Pounds 1.29m. The results were compiled under FRS 3
accounting principles.
Sales for the six months rose to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 28.9m) but at the
operating level profits dropped from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 621,000.
The exceptional credit compared with a Pounds 168,000 debit previously.
Within the specialist printing division margins in the second quarter were
hit by cost and competitive factors.
In marketing services, sales fell by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 9.5m, mainly
reflecting the downturn in trading in the direct marketing agencies in
France and the Netherlands. In the UK Aspen Field Marketing experienced
lower profits due to reduced spending by clients.
Media and communications benefited from improved volumes to report higher
sales of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 7.7m). However, Aspen Business Communications
was disappointed by a deterioration in trading.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said the results were disappointing following the
improvement seen in the second half of 1992, but he was confident that
progress would resume in the second half.
Net tangible assets at June 30 were Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.3m) and net
borrowings of Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 4.9m) meant gearing of 19.1 per cent
(47.6 per cent).
The interim dividend is held at 2p on earnings per share of 6.6p (4.6p).

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: John I Jacobs at Pounds 46,000 midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN I Jacobs, the shipowning and shipbroking group, announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 46,000 for the half year ended June 30.
The comparable outcome has been restated in accordance with FRS 3 and
accordingly the Pounds 3.85m achieved on the disposal of Jacobs Offshore has
been included in the pre-tax figure of Pounds 3.44m.
The Directors said that the broking departments had achieved increased
levels of activity and there were indications that the improvement would be
more than sustained during the second half.
The coaster fleet achieved better results than in the second half of 1992,
they said.
It was unlikely that the group would have to commit any further new cash
resources to the shipowning activity.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.13m) and operating profits came
out at Pounds 125,000 against losses of Pounds 110,000.
There were earnings per share of 0.5p (11.5p) and a maintained interim
dividend of 0.5p is declared.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: French closure costs leave TDG 80% lower at
Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT Development Group, Britain's second largest haulier, yesterday
revealed an 80 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.5m,
fuelled by the Pounds 12.4m cost of closing a lossmaking business in France.
The decline came as TDG warned of an increasingly gloomy outlook for the
continental European economy in spite of recent ERM turbulence.
Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, said it was 'a gut feeling that things have
not yet stabilised there . . . We believe matters may well get worse before
they get better.' TDG derives a third of its turnover from continental
Europe.
Mr Llowarch was optimistic, nevertheless, saying the pre-tax figures masked
a solid performance at the operating level, where profits from continuing
operations fell by just Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 15.9m.
Sales for the six months to June 30 were 3 per cent lower at Pounds 276.6m.
'We have taken a one-off hit to deal with a particular situation,' he said,
referring to the costs of winding up Translittoral, the long-distance
haulier.
'The results are quite encouraging against the lack of any economic
recovery.' He did not expect any further significant provisions.
It was on this basis that the group had decided to dip into reserves to
maintain its dividend at 3p.
Losses per share were 1.66p against earnings of 7.51p last time.
TDG had suffered most in continental Europe, where it is heavily exposed in
France, Germany and the Netherlands. Operating profits there had tumbled
from Pounds 4.26m to Pounds 2.89m, while margins had dropped by about a
third.
The UK returned a 9 per cent improvement in operating profits to Pounds
15.1m, largely due to two years of restructuring.
Mr Llowarch stressed that in spite of the improved performance, the group
had 'not noticed any significant change in economic activity'.
He said that the sale of Willig Freight in the US, due for completion in
March, had been difficult to finalise. Some Dollars 16m (Pounds 10.7m) was
still outstanding.
However, he remained confident that the new payment programme would be met
by the US purchaser.
COMMENT
Take a look at some of TDG's peers, such as NFC, and investors might have
some idea of just how the company will look in three to four years' time.
This is a company that seems to be paying the price of starting to cope with
recession just that little bit too late. Nevertheless, the work is under
way, and the balance sheet is strong with gearing of 17 per cent. There is
also the Dollars 16m yet to come from Willig. Forecasts are for Pounds 35m
this year, leaving the shares looking somewhat overvalued on a multiple of
18. It would appear that the market has been somewhat over-enthusiastic
following ERM turmoil. Any real effects of European recovery are expected to
be as much as 18 months away.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins rebels active again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders of Hoskins Brewery, the small real ale brewer, have
requisitioned an extraordinary meeting, at which resolutions will be put to
remove two directors, Mr Barrie Hoar and his brother Robert, and elect a
shareholder, Mr Richard Holman, to the board.
Last year a separate attempt to remove the Hoar brothers, whose family then
held 30 per cent of the shares, collapsed when dissident shareholders, also
critical of management, failed to win sufficient shareholder support.
Mr Holman, the rebel shareholder leader, said he was waiting for the company
to respond to his move.
Mr Holman, who bought into the company at the beginning of this year and
holds a 7.4 per cent stake, said he had circulated the company's
shareholders and found 'considerable support' for management change. He
claimed 40 per cent of shareholders were behind him in April when he was
preparing to call a special meeting.
He said: 'After about eight years the profit and loss account shows a
deficit, Hoskins has never paid a dividend and directors fees and emoluments
totalled Pounds 500,000 in the last five years. Shareholders are not
benefiting from this management.'
No one from Hoskins was available for comment yesterday.

730,000

<TEXT>
FLAGSTONE Holdings, the marina, leisure and property group, incurred a
reduced loss of Pounds 730,000 before tax, down from Pounds 2.5m, in the
year to January 31, after a return to profits at the operating level.
The group warned that uncertainty over its future working capital, resulting
from an acquisition currently under discussion, was expected to be referred
to by its auditors in their report on the accounts.
On Monday, Flagstone said it was in talks with another party over a deal
which 'will have a significant impact on the company's prospects.'
The other party has lent Flagstone Pounds 500,000 for one year at a 7 per
cent interest rate to provide working capital.
Flagstone said yesterday that Charterhouse Tilney no longer acted as its
broker, Williams de Broe was advising on the transaction.
Group sales were Pounds 612,000 (Pounds 1.11m) and operating profits Pounds
466,000 (Pounds 310,000 loss).
Net interest payable was Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 407,000) and there was a
Pounds 573,000 write-down of the company's marina (Pounds 625,000 property
write down).
Losses per share were 0.53p (1.58p loss).

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Burton rationalises Champion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON, the retail group, is selling part of its Champion Sport chain to
Cobra Sports for Pounds 2m and reducing Champion's operations to its outlets
within Debenhams.
The rationalisation is the latest in a series of reforms undertaken by Mr
John Hoerner, the American chief executive appointed in February 1992, aimed
at turning the group around.
Champion's stand alone stores are expected to increase their losses to
Pounds 3m for the year to August 28, although the Debenhams outlets are
profitable.
The rationalisation will result in an exceptional charge of Pounds 5m,
consisting mainly of property write-off costs. Analysts are now forecasting
full-year profits for Burton of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m, up from
Pounds 9.4m last year.
Mr Richard North, finance director, admitted yesterday that the Champion
chain, formed after Burton acquired Debenhams in 1985, had 'never really
been profitable as a whole entity.'
The sportswear market had been made tough by the recession and lower demand
for branded merchandise.
Cobra, the independent sports retailer, has bought 31 of Champion's 43
stores for Pounds 2m, and will take on their 400 staff and management.
The remaining 12 stores will be sold or converted into other Burton group
outlets.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Royal Dutch/Shell lifted by oil side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL raised profits by 15 per cent in the first half of the
year as improvements in its oil business more than offset persistent losses
in chemicals.
However, the result was below market expectations and the shares slipped 9
1/2 p to 633p.
The multinational oil group earned Pounds 1.59bn, up from Pounds 1.38bn, on
a replacement cost basis which removes gains and losses from holdings stocks
of oil. This included a 20 per cent increase in second quarter profits from
Pounds 516m to Pounds 619m.
But that quarter included Pounds 183m of restructuring charges, of which
Pounds 112m was in chemicals for redundancy and write-downs. The size of
these charges was the main reason for market disappointment with the result.
Profits from exploration and production improved by 22 per cent in the first
half, from Pounds 813m to Pounds 992m. This included a much stronger
contribution from the US where Shell Oil was making progress in reducing
costs, and where gas prices had recently risen.
The manufacturing, marine and marketing operations also produced higher
profits, ahead 35 per cent at Pounds 892m (Pounds 663m). Although refinery
intake was little changed, sales of oil products were up 5 per cent. Again,
much of the improvement came from better cost control in the US. Elsewhere,
there were Pounds 71m of restructuring charges.
But the effect of these improvements was dampened by Pounds 173m of losses
in the chemicals business, the bulk of which - Pounds 151m - was incurred in
the second quarter. Petrochemical markets remained depressed with only
limited signs of recovery, Shell said, and volumes were affected by
maintenance shutdowns at principal plants.
Sterling's strength against other European currencies and the dollar over
the second quarter resulted in Pounds 141m of currency losses over that
period, exceeding the Pounds 102m losses incurred in the same period of
1992.
The interim dividends for Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, which account for
60 and 40 per cent of the group's profit respectively, will be announced on
September 9.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Strong second quarter lifts BP to Pounds
1.17bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum yesterday reported a strong set of second quarter results
which exceeded the market's expectations.
On a replacement cost basis, operating profits in the second three months of
the year were Pounds 581m, up from Pounds 385m last time. After exceptional
items, the result was Pounds 261m, compared to last time's loss of Pounds
812m caused by over Pounds 1bn of restructuring charges following boardroom
upheavals.
The second quarter figures brought the half-year profit to Pounds 1.17bn,
compared with Pounds 808m for the first half of the previous year. After
exceptionals, profits of Pounds 510m compared with a previous deficit of
Pounds 717m.
The second quarterly dividend remains unchanged at 2.1p making 4.2p (6.3p)
to date.
The main reason for the improvement was the continuing effect of the cost
reduction programme launched last year. Exploration and production made an
operating profit of Pounds 474m, up from Pounds 356m in last year's second
quarter, though down from the first quarter of this year. The half year
result was Pounds 990m, up from Pounds 770m.
Refining and marketing made Pounds 197m, up from Pounds 59m last year,
bringing the half year profit to Pounds 321m, up from Pounds 95m. This was
the best quarterly result since 1991, and followed strengthening demand and
wider refining margins, and significant cost reductions.
The chemicals business reported a loss of Pounds 23m, compared to last
year's second quarter profit of Pounds 5m. Margins in petrochemicals and
polyethylene remain depressed, though they have been offset by improvements
in the acetyls, nitriles and specialties businesses and cost savings. The
overall first half loss of Pounds 37m included restructuring charges of
Pounds 24m.
BP pursued its strategy of divestment during the first half, realising
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.07bn) in the period. This strengthened cash flow and
enabled BP to continue paying down Dollars 1.1bn of debt. However, since
debt is largely denominated in dollars, the weakness of sterling left
gearing unchanged from the first quarter at 94 per cent.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said that demand for oil would increase
worldwide by about 1.5 per cent, but that did not necessarily mean stronger
oil prices because of high levels of supply. Demand for oil products was
also weak in the US and Europe, and the trading environment for chemicals
was 'likely to remain difficult'. Disposals were expected to yield total
proceeds of Dollars 2bn by the end of the third quarter.
Mr John Browne, managing director for exploration and production, said that
recent changes in UK taxation were unlikely to alter BP's activity in the
North Sea, though it might be refocused.
BP is also optimistic about prospects in exploration areas such as Colombia,
Azerbaijan, west Africa, the Gulf of Mexico and the west of Shetlands.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: DCC offer values Flogas at IPounds 79.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company founded and run by
Mr Jim Flavin, yesterday bid 325p a share to lift its 29.9 per cent stake in
Flogas, the publicly quoted Irish distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, to
60.1 per cent.
The bid values Flogas, which is the UK and Ireland's second largest supplier
of LPG, at IPounds 79.4m (Pounds 74.5m). Its shares closed at 240p.
Yesterday Flogas directors, who are recommending the partial cash offer,
estimated that the group would report a pre-tax profit of IPounds 6.5m for
the six months to June 30, equivalent to earnings per share of 23.3p. The
offer price represents a multiple of 13.9 times estimated earnings.
In the 13 months to June 30 last year Flogas reported pre-tax profits of
IPounds 7.2m and earnings per share of 23.9p.
DCC, which has interests in five core sectors including the energy and waste
oil management sector, said it was making the partial bid to expand its
interests in this area.
Under the terms of the offer, Powerimpact, a subsidiary of DCC in which the
executive directors and another executive of Flogas will have a 20 per cent
minority interest, is bidding for up to 7.37m Flogas shares.
Flogas shareholders, other than DCC which already holds 7.32m Flogas shares,
who accept the offer will be assured of receiving 325p for up to 43 per cent
of their individual holdings. Flogas directors hold 1.87m shares, equivalent
to a 7.6 per cent stake.
DCC said that Flogas would retain its existing executive and non-executive
directors and management.
The committee of independent Flogas directors, advised by SG Warburg, has
said that it considered the partial offer to be fair and reasonable and have
unanimously recommended it.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dowty buy helps TI rise 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACQUISITION of Dowty, the aerospace group, enabled TI, the specialist
engineering company, to report a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for
the half year to June 30.
Profits rose to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 50.2m) on increased sales of Pounds
736.7m (Pounds 471.4m). However, earnings per share fell from 10.2p to 9p.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive, said the takeover of
Dowty had diluted earnings more that expected because of the softness in the
aerospace industry, which he expects to improve over the year.
'I am always asked every time I do an acquisition whether I paid too much at
the wrong time. I believe the Pounds 500m paid for Dowty last year was the
right price at the right time.'
The group is in negotiations to sell a number of non-core businesses, a move
expected to raise some Pounds 100m. About half of this should be completed
before the year-end, significantly reducing debt.
Borrowings for the half year rose to Pounds 241m, representing gearing of 86
per cent. An interest charge of Pounds 5m compared with a credit of Pounds
8m last year.
Rationalisation at Dowty led to the closure of 2 of its headquarters, two
layers of management and the loss of 1,500 jobs over the past year, reducing
the workforce to 5,000.
In the last six months 800 employees lost their jobs, most of them at Dowty.
Redundancy costs were part of a Pounds 9m (Pounds 3m)reorganisation charge.
Sir Christopher described the planned joint venture of Dowty's landing gear
business with Snecma's landing gear company, Messier-Bugatti, as a 'merger
for growth'.
The two other core businesses continued to perform strongly. John Crane,
producing engineered seals, lifted operating profits to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds
22.3m). Bundy, making specialised tubes, saw operating profits rise to
Pounds 23m (Pounds 19.7m).
Sir Christopher said: 'People forget that 70 per cent of our business is
generated by John Crane and Bundy, neither of which are exposed to the
aerospace industry.'
The interim dividend is raised to 3.85p (3.7p).
COMMENT
Two of TI's legs have always looked solid, which is why the management has
been so keen to remind the City that they generate more than two thirds of
revenue. It was the third, Dowty, which looked worrying. The downturn in the
aerospace industry has been worse than TI expected. The acquisition could
prove more dilutive in the full year than first envisaged, although the
company said it should not prove material. The joint venture with
Messier-Bugatti should firm up Dowty when it is completed next year. By then
investors will have a clearer idea as to whether Dowty is as good a buy as
TI says it is. Debt remains high, but the disposal programme should, to a
large extent, remedy that by the year end. With forecast pre-tax profits of
Pounds 130m, the shares - up 7p to 358p - look fairly priced on a
prospective multiple of 18.8.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: A technique for success - Raymond Snoddy on
the Reed/Elsevier merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK THE chairmen of Reed International and Elsevier, Peter Davis and Pierre
Vinken, what difference the merging of their two companies has meant in the
past six months and they say - Editions Techniques.
The first results announced yesterday by Reed Elsevier, now one of the
world's largest publishing and information groups, were good - a headline
profit before tax of Pounds 281m for the six months to the end of June.
But it was the acquisition of Editions Techniques, France's largest legal
publisher completed last month in a Pounds 77m deal which demonstrates, they
believe, the benefits of merger.
Reed International, which owned Butterworths, the English legal publisher,
had been interested in Editions Techniques for some time but had never been
able to buy it.
Reed, Mr Davis confesses, had found it easier to expand in the English
language common law countries of the Commonwealth.
Pierre Vinken, a former neurosurgeon, had plenty of experience of medical
publishing, none in the specialist field of the law. Together they managed
to buy the company.
'The negotiations were all conducted in French - fluent French,' says Pierre
Vinken pointedly. The task was assigned to the old Elsevier finance team
which is based in Neuchatel in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.
'Symbolically and strategically, it was much more important than Pounds
77m,' says Mr Davis of the deal.
The acquisition is a small example of what the merger was supposed to be
primarily about - providing complementary entrees to different markets, Reed
to continental Europe, Elsevier to the US, rather than cutting costs.
Then there is the extra clout that the combined resources of the two
companies can make available if the right opportunities come along.
Their gaze at the moment is focused on Official Airline Guides, the former
Maxwell company being sold by administrators Price Waterhouse. Reed
Elsevier, which has signed a non-exclusive letter-of-intent to pay Dollars
425m (Pounds 285m) for the business, is now in the final stages of due
diligence.
The outcome for Reed Elsevier could still be influenced by the sale of
Macmillan, the US publisher, now under way. The Robert M Bass group together
with Paramount are seen as favourites for the Macmillan deal but they have
made it clear they want OAG as part of the package. 'It's like playing chess
on two boards,' says Pierre Vinken.
Even if Reed Elsevier fails to get OAG, there appears to be no shortage of
potential takeover targets for the company. It has a list of 15-20
prospects, many of them in continental Europe and the US.
The basic work of integrating the two companies has been carried out and
both sides said yesterday it was working well.
One question no-one at Reed Elsevier could, or would, answer yesterday was
how the pre-merger businesses were doing relative to each other.
'My businesses are doing better than your business? We don't have
conversations like that,' said Mr Davis.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Buyer of Starmin assets faces charges on
unrelated issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the men at the centre of deals connected with Starmin Group's
disclosure that reported full year losses had been understated, was last
year charged with offences under the Theft Act in an unrelated matter.
Mr Brian Masterson, director of the privately-held Jeniva Landfill and its
subsidiary Chepstow Environmental Services, faced the charges at Bow St
Magistrates Court, London last August.
Starmin, a quarry products company, is chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former
cabinet minister, and was, until July, controlled by the Abdullah brothers,
who earlier had built up the Evered aggregates company.
In July Starmin announced a review of its 1992 accounts. On Tuesday the
company said that a change in accounting policies meant that instead of
pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.06m for 1992, losses totalled Pounds 11.9m. The
proposed final dividend of 0.2p will not now be paid.
The charges against Mr Masterson arise from his position on the board of the
Caird Group waste management company in the late 1980s. The case was
remanded to Southwark Crown Court and a trial is set for January next year.
Starmin's advisers said that the company regarded Mr Masterson as 'one of
the top men in the quarry business'. Starmin had felt he could enhance the
value of some of its sites.
The understatement of Starmin's losses hinges on profits having been booked
on disposals which have now been reversed.
The company had recorded a Pounds 1.4m profit on the sale of some assets and
landfill facilities to Chepstow in December 1991. However, that deal had
fallen through by April 1993.
In May 1992 a company controlled by Mr Masterson, Environmental Protection
and Disposal, bought Chepstow for Pounds 1.89m, mainly in loan notes, and
sold it to Jeniva in December that year for Pounds 1.85m in shares and an
undetermined deferred consideration.
Jeniva took on Chepstow's original purchase of assets from Starmin plus an
additional quarry with a Pounds 100,000 net book value, and a Pounds 160,000
cash injection from Starmin. It paid for them with its own shares,
representing 35.5 per cent of its total equity. Starmin booked an extra
profit of Pounds 250,000 on the sale of the additional quarry.
Starmin said a balance of Pounds 1.26m which had been recorded as 'owing'
from Chepstow was now being written off, while the Pounds 750,000 investment
in Jeniva had been written down to its cost of Pounds 438,000.
The balance of the increased losses stemmed from other transactions and a
provision of Pounds 1.03m related to non-core activities.
Accounts filed in January for Jeniva and EPD showed that both were qualified
by their auditors who prepared them on a going concern basis.

FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Barclays making heavy charges for US assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Transition business announced yesterday by Barclays follows a review
of operations which started last summer and discovered three groups of
assets that the bank decided were probably not worth book value.
The review was led by Mr Richard Webb, who was appointed US chief executive
in January after Mr John Kerslake retired. It led to doubtful assets being
isolated, although executives insist that it is not simply a poor asset 'bad
bank'.
First element is Barclays/American Mortgage. This has the right to receive
fees for processing the mortgage books of other lenders. But as interest
rates have fallen, many borrowers have paid off mortgages to refinance them
at lower rates.
This has reduced the value of the earnings stream, and the bank has made a
Pounds 60m specific provision against this. It hopes to develop the business
by originating new mortgages and securitising them through its BZW
securities arm.
Second is a book of poorly-priced corporate loans which the bank made in the
late 1980s, some on margins as low as 15 basis points. Although they are
performing it has made a Pounds 108m general provision to prepare them for
sale.
Third is a book of non-performing corporate loans, mostly in real estate, on
which Barclays has made a Pounds 107m specific provision. The final Pounds
10m of the Pounds 285m total loss for the business came from items such as
staff costs.
The Pounds 275m provision contributed to a total of Pounds 997m (Pounds
1.05bn) in the first half of 1993. UK specific provisions fell to Pounds
657m (Pounds 825m), helped by fewer large corporate provisions, but French
problems lifted EC provisions to Pounds 81m (Pounds 31m).
The core banking division, including UK branch banking and corporate and
institutional banking, raised profits to Pounds 407m, against Pounds 98m.
This was despite a fall in lending volumes, particularly in the corporate
sector.
Net interest income in corporate banking increased due to a Pounds 102m fall
in provisions, many on property-related lending, wider lending margins and
cost reduction efforts. Barclaycard, the UK credit card arm, improved
'substantially'.
The bank maintained its margin on interest-bearing assets at 3 per cent, and
raised the spread between interest earned on loans and paid on liabilities
to 2.5 per cent (2.2 per cent). This was achieved by hedging of liabilities.
The core tier 1 capital ratio was 5.6 per cent (5.9 per cent). It raised
Pounds 634m of tier 2 capital, increasing the capital adequacy ratio to 9.7
per cent (8.9 per cent).
Post-tax return on equity was 7 per cent, and Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman,
said the target remained 15 per cent. It was content with a target below
National Westminster's 17.5 per cent because it did not want to take on
excess risk.
Mr Buxton said the bank was maintaining its market share of lending, but
this was not vital. 'We can afford to lose a bit of market share as long as
we come out with a better business,' he said.
Earnings per share rose to 11.7p (losses 3.7p) and the interim dividend is
cut to 6.5p (9.15p).

FT  06 AUG 93 / Bulls on bonds get set for another charge: Tracy Corrigan
and Sara Webb on a surging market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bull market in European bonds, which began back in 1990, has been given
a fresh lease of life by the shake-up of the exchange rate mechanism last
weekend.
This year's sharp decline in yields - already ahead of forecasts - had
convinced many experts that the rally was nearing an end.
But, even before the ERM crisis, it was becoming apparent that European
interest rates needed to fall substantially to give foundering economies a
chance to recover, especially as most countries had low inflation.
The initial conclusion of this week's reassessment seems to be that, far
from petering out in the third quarter, the bull market in European bonds is
set fair for another year.
'People are progressively revising down their interest rate targets and that
process is likely to continue,' said Mr Phillip Saunders, fixed interest
investment director at Guinness Flight.
The markets which are set to benefit most from the slackening of ERM
strictures are the higher yielding ones, such as Spain and Italy, since
their interest rates have the furthest to fall.
'We've taken our 12-month forecast for 10-year Italian government bond
yields (currently 9.2 per cent) down to 8 per cent,' said Mr Michael Burke,
an economist at Citibank. 'We had pencilled in a target of 8 3/4 per cent,
which was already way below the consensus in the market.'
There may be lessons to draw from the persistent bull market in US bonds,
which has also defied analysts' expectations. 'US bond yields are still
falling, 10 quarters into a recovery, and conditions here (in Europe) are
going to be rougher if anything,' Mr Saunders observed.
In Europe, it seems that continental governments are unlikely to follow the
pattern set by the UK, where rates were cut rapidly following sterling's
departure from the ERM last September.
'It is very noticeable that there has been no stampede to cut interest rates
dramatically,' said Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed interest and currency at
Rothschild Asset Management.
A gradual easing of rates is less likely to increase inflationary pressures.
Furthermore, the UK experience of devaluation - higher import prices have
been absorbed without boosting inflation - has helped to calm nerves.
'We are in an era of disinflation - it might be too early to say deflation,'
says Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Citibank, who points out that the
latest economic data shows that prices are falling in the UK, France,
Ireland and Scandinavia.
The effect is that the outlook for longer-dated bonds appears increasingly
positive. Although short-term rates will fall more sharply than long-term
rates, longer-dated bonds will still benefit from any rally.
Consensus is also growing that real interest rates will have to fall. So
far, real yields on bonds have fallen less than nominal yields. While
inflation has declined, official interest rates have been held up to support
currencies. Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier, expects
real yields to fall substantially 'for real recovery to take place'.
In a floating exchange rate environment, investors are likely to change
their emphasis from nominal yields to real yields.
'In the old ERM grid, nominal yields tended to converge but in the new
set-up there will be something more akin to real yield convergence,'
according to Mr Jeremy Hale, European economist at Goldman Sachs.
Fund managers are either remaining heavily invested in Europe, or increasing
their exposure. Some traders reported heavy flows into gilts and
Euro-sterling bonds this week from US fund managers, who are not frequent
buyers in the gilts market.
Evidence that fund managers are preparing for a further ally in European
bonds is provided by their heavy weighting in these markets. Allocation
based on the JP Morgan government bond index is around 35 per cent, but most
fund managers are overweight in Europe - one London-based manager said he
had 85 per cent of assets invested in European bonds.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Shell hit by chemicals and currency: Oil groups restructure
their way out of big losses, tight margins and low prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch/Shell shook the market yesterday by disclosing a Pounds 183m
charge for restructuring, much of it relating to its loss-making chemical
business.
Shares in Shell, the UK arm of the Anglo-Dutch oil group, fell 9 1/2 p to
633p.
The charge was included in the company's half-yearly results, which showed
that other parts of the group performed strongly, producing a 20 per cent
rise in profits in the second quarter in spite of a weak oil price and tight
margins.
Shell said the cause for the charges had already been announced, though
there might have been uncertainty about the timing. Most of them - Pounds
112m - related to chemicals. Of this, Pounds 13m was to cover redundancy
costs, and Pounds 99m was for asset sales and write-downs, including the
crop protection business which is being sold.
The rest of the charge covered restructuring in the downstream business
where Shell is trying to cut costs. Deutsche Shell, the German affiliate,
announced yesterday that it was laying off 20 per cent of its staff.
The group's chemical business made a loss of Pounds 151m in the second
quarter, bringing its total losses for the year so far to Pounds 173m.
'Petrochemical market conditions remain depressed with only limited signs of
recovery,' the group said. The only bright spot was the US, where Shell's
chemical operations made a small Pounds 16m profit in the second quarter.
A further factor hurting profits was a Pounds 141m currency loss caused by
the strengthening of sterling against continental currencies during late
spring and early summer. Large currency swings are a recurring feature of
Shell's results.
The overall result showed a second quarter profit of Pounds 619m, excluding
gains and losses from oil holdings. This brought profits for the first half
to Pounds 1.6bn, an increase of 15 per cent on the Pounds 1.4bn earned in
the same period last year.
Shell's oil exploration and production activities boosted their profits by
Pounds 60m to Pounds 408m. There was also a strong 25 per cent gain in
downstream and transport activities where quarterly earnings reached Pounds
463m.
Analysts said the market was taken aback by the size of the charge, even
though the underlying result was quite strong. 'If you strip out the
restructuring costs and the currency losses, this was a good set of
figures,' one analyst said last night.
However, Shell was cautious about the outlook. It said that oil prices had
weakened over the quarter because of Opec's inability to agree on quotas,
and the prospect of a resumption of supplies from Iraq.
'Although a modest recovery of prices might be expected as demand increases
in the second half of the year,' it said, 'the market is likely to remain
volatile.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / 'Better times' for slimmer BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG gain in second quarter profits yesterday took British Petroleum a
step further to recovery from last year's heavy losses.
The group unveiled operating profits of Pounds 581m on a replacement cost
basis, which excludes the effect of changes in the value of oil inventories.
Last summer BP plunged deep into loss after making a charge of more than
Pounds 1bn following the ousting of its former chairman Mr Bob Horton.
Mr David Simon, the chief executive, said: 'It is no longer the worst of
times. It is not yet the best of times. But it is better times.'
The result was better than the market had been expecting and BP's shares
gained 2 1/2 p to 306p.
Much of the improvement came from the severe cost-cutting campaign
instituted by Mr Simon. Several thousand people have left the company, and
more than Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of assets have been sold so far this
year.
Among the group's operations, the refining and marketing side made the
strongest advance by more than trebling profits compared to last year. Oil
exploration and production was up over the first half as a whole. But the
chemicals business continued to suffer from the squeeze in margins,
recording a first half loss of Pounds 37m, including Pounds 24m of
restructuring charges.
Mr Simon said the group was still aiming to reach its target of Dollars 2bn
profit by 1995, along with capital spending of Dollars 5bn a year, and
annual debt repayment of Dollars 1bn. The improvement also meant that a
rights issue was unnecessary. But the returns being earned were still not
high enough, and it was too soon to increase the dividend.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Philips rises 48% after cost controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, reaped the benefits of strict
controls on financial expenses and assets to produce a 48 per cent rise in
net profit before extraordinary items in the second quarter.
The rise, to Fl 117m (Pounds 41m) from Fl 70m a year earlier, was achieved
in spite of a 22 per cent drop in operating profit caused by difficult
conditions in Europe, particularly in consumer electronics and
communications.
Net profit including extraordinaries surged to Fl 1.2bn from Fl 79m a year
earlier. This reflected the previously announced gain of Fl 1.1bn on the
sale of Philips' stake in Matsushita Electronics Corp (MEC) to its joint
venture partner, Matsushita of Japan. Group sales fell 1.3 per cent at Fl
13.5bn.
Mr Dudley Eustace, finance director, was not happy with the continued
pressure on profit margins but rather satisfied with progress made on
reducing inventories, speeding up payments from customers and pruning
working capital. Operating profit fell to Fl 485m from Fl 626m, but this was
matched by a drop in financial expenses to Fl 278m from Fl 411m.
First-half operating profits fell from Fl 1.27bn to Fl 1.05bn while the net
figure rose from Fl 241m to Fl 1.32bn. On the second-quarter figures, Mr
Eustace said excellent results were posted by Philips lighting, domestic
appliances, semi-conductor and medical system businesses, and by PolyGram,
its London-based record and film company.
However, communications systems saw first-half operating profits dwindle to
Fl 55m from Fl 295m. Consumer electronics - Philips' biggest business in
terms of sales - narrowed first-half operating losses to Fl 150m from Fl
177m, helped by the discontinuation of sectors such as personal computers
and magnetic tape for video cassettes. Mr Eustace said the pace of disposals
would accelerate in the second half. He declined to predict full-year
profits or comment on the likelihood of a dividend after a three-year gap.
Philips's ratio of gross debt to group equity fell to 53:47 from 61:39 at
end-1992, partly because of a fall in debt after the Fl 3bn in proceeds from
the MEC sale. Stricter management of trade receivables and other assets
produced a surplus of Fl 1.7bn, taking the overall financing surplus to Fl4
.7bn, compared with a deficit of Fl 1.8bn last year.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Positive debut for merged publisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWEST Anglo-Dutch collaboration, Reed Elsevier, the international
publishing and information group, yesterday unveiled a 24 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits in its first set of results since the merger.
Currency movements favoured the first-half figures, which rose from Pounds
227m to Pounds 281m before tax and a Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m) gain on asset
sales.
The performance from putting together businesses such as Reed's IPC
Magazines and Elsevier's scientific journals represented an increase of 13
per cent in constant currency terms.
'We are pleased that this first set of results for Reed Elsevier shows a
strong performance,' said the chairmen, Mr Pierre Vinken of Elsevier, and Mr
Peter Davis of Reed International. Both companies are separately quoted on
both the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges.
They warned, however, that economic conditions remained difficult in two of
their main markets - the UK and the US - and had deteriorated further in
continental Europe.
The one surprise was the poor performance of medical publishing with profits
down more than 50 per cent. Markets were weak and uncertainty affected
pharmaceutical advertising in the US, Germany and Italy. Overall the
scientific and medical division lifted operating profits 13 per cent to
Pounds 76m.
Professional publishing showed a 30 per cent profit rise to Pounds 60m, and
the consumer division was up 23 per cent to Pounds 54m with good
performances from books and IPC magazines. The business division contributed
Pounds 105m, up 13 per cent.
'The results are reasonable by any standard,' Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst,
said yesterday. Analysts are looking for Pounds 517m to Pounds 520m for the
full year, excluding proceeds from selling a stake in British Sky
Broadcasting.
For Reed International shareholders, earnings per share grew 21 per cent
under FRS3 accounting rules to 21p. Reed has declared a dividend of 7.5p, up
3 per cent.
Earnings per share for Elsevier shareholders, under FRS3, went up 8 per cent
to Fl 4.41, with a dividend of Fl 1.67.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Barclays recovers as headhunting goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, yesterday returned to profits helped by a
strong performance from its core banking division. Its interim pre-tax
profit of Pounds 335m compared with Pounds 51m in the first half of last
year and a full-year loss of Pounds 242m.
Provisons for bad debts fell Pounds 51m, but still stood at Pounds 997m.
The bank cut its interim dividend from 9.15p to 6.5p to 'rebalance' it after
the halving of last year's final to 6p.
Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman, said Barclays was 'at an advanced' stage in its
search for a new chief executive, from outside, to split his roles. The
search started in March after pressure from investors.
'We have had some very high quality candidates, so there is no truth in the
rumour that we have found it difficult to find candidates,' said Mr Buxton.
The results were affected by an unexpected Pounds 275m provision for
troubled businesses in the US. The bank has created a United States
Transition business holding Pounds 4.3bn of assets including poor property
loans, its US mortgage processing business, and a portfolio of inadequately
priced loans.
The BZW investment banking division made a Pounds 234m profit, against
Pounds 118m. Foreign exchange trading made gross profits before staff and
other costs of Pounds 137m, against Pounds 105m, and other dealing income
rose from Pounds 79m to Pounds 247m.
The bank retained earnings of Pounds 84m, against a deficit of Pounds 206m.
This was the first time since the first half of 1991 that Barclays has
managed to retain earnings.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Devaluation of sterling cuts deficit by Pounds 2.9bn:
Overseas earnings boost for UK current account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account deficit was nearly Pounds 3bn smaller in 1992 than
the government originally estimated, thanks to an unexpected boost from the
devalued pound.
The final balance of payments figures published yesterday showed a sharp
jump in UK earnings from overseas portfolio investments, partly because of
the drop in sterling.
The current account deficit for last year was Pounds 8.6bn, Pounds 2.9bn
lower than provisional estimates of Pounds 11.5bn published in March. In
1991, the deficit was Pounds 7.7bn.
Although final quarterly figures for 1992 are not yet available, economists
suspect that the improvement in the UK's balance of payments performance
came from the automatic boost to income earned in foreign currencies that
followed the pound's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September.
The latest figures are likely to prompt revisions to economists' pessimistic
predictions for the 1993 current account deficit.
The average forecast among City and academic economists is for a deficit of
Pounds 16.4bn and in March, the Treasury forecast a deficit of Pounds
17.5bn.
'This is not really a change in the UK's underlying performance,' said Mr
Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities.
'But nor is it necessarily a transient change, provided the pound remains
relatively weak.'
The Treasury said the figures were encouraging as they showed a much smaller
deterioration in the current account between 1991 and 1992.
Earnings from interest, profits and dividends registered a surplus of Pounds
5.8bn compared with only Pounds 320m in 1991.
The overall surplus on invisible earnings - which include services,
interest, profits, dividends and government transfers - was Pounds 4.8bn,
compared with Pounds 2.6bn in 1991.
The trend in visible, or merchandise, trade remains gloomy. The visible
trade deficit was Pounds 13.4bn last year, compared with Pounds 10.3bn in
1991.
Estimates of the capital account - net transactions in assets and
liabilities - which should add up to the current account balance, implied a
net capital inflow of Pounds 8.32bn. There was thus a 'balancing item' - the
gap between the capital and current accounts - of Pounds 301m. This was the
slimmest balancing item since 1975 when it was minus Pounds 4m.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Proposals to speed road plans win broad welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT measures to speed up the building of roads were yesterday
welcomed by business and the road transport industry. However, environmental
lobbyists said an accelerated roadbuilding programme would simply cause
environmental damage at a faster pace.
The measures, which were unveiled by Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, include the setting up of a Highways Agency and a review of the
500 schemes already under consideration to establish clear priorities.
Proposed changes to the planning process would also cut between three and
five years off the 13 years it currently takes to plan and build new roads.
The proposals include:
A 'less adversarial' approach to decision-taking on road schemes with
round-table conferences to seek consensus over plans.
A sweeping review of public inquiry rules to cut red tape and time-wasting
procedures.
Help to enable public inquiry inspectors produce their reports faster.
Mr MacGregor said that 'tedious time-wasting' procedures would be taken out
of the inquiry system. 'We must accelerate the delivery of vitally needed
roads and cut costs, time, bureaucracy, uncertainty and blight,' he said.
He promised that the changes would safeguard the public's right to object to
road plans.
The Confederation of British Industry said the establishment of a Highways
Agency was 'good news'.
The Royal Automobile Club saw the creation of the agency as a radical step
towards more efficient management of the road network.
Environmental groups attacked the package as an attempt to push through the
government's roads programme and called for many of the plans to be
scrapped.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said: 'The government seems
determined to push through its discredited roads programme as quickly as
possible.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / Pakistan seeks IMF loan to bolster depleted reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN is negotiating a short-term loan from the International Monetary
Fund after suffering a sharp fall in foreign exchange reserves, believed to
have left it with the equivalent of about two weeks' import payments, senior
officials in Islamabad said yesterday.
The reserves sank amid the turmoil of the political power struggle which
ended with the resignations on July 18 of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Mr
Nawaz Sharif, prime minister.
Official figures are not available, but commercial bankers in Karachi
estimate that reserves have risen from their lowest level - which has not
been disclosed - since the appointment of an interim government. They now
stand at about Dollars 350m (Pounds 234.8m), compared with Dollars 1bn a
year ago.
An IMF mission is in Islamabad to discuss new credits with the government of
Mr Moeen Qureshi, the prime minister and former senior World Bank official,
who is due to hold office until elections in two months.
Mr Qureshi is preparing a comprehensive package of economic reforms intended
to reduce government spending, increase revenues and boost exports.
The government wants the economic programme to be supported by the IMF,
which would initially arrange short-term financing of about Dollars 200m to
meet immediate balance of payments needs.
This would later be replaced and supplemented by a Dollars 1.2bn IMF loan
over three years. Final agreement on the larger credit would have to await
discussions with the incoming government.
Mr Qureshi, who has a relatively free hand because his long absence from
Pakistan as an international financial official has left him free of
domestic political ties, is acting rapidly to deal with economic
difficulties.
Mr Babar Ali, a leading industrialist appointed finance minister, said: 'Our
interim government has the unique opportunity of demonstrating to them
(politicians) how things could be done, because we have no legislature to go
back to, we have no lobby to satisfy.'
The government has sought to boost exports with a 9 per cent devaluation of
the rupee. Mr Qureshi has also set up a committee of senior officials to
make recommendations for cuts in public spending.

<TEXT>
Gold's rise this year was fuelled by the well-publicised behaviour of a few
investors such as Sir James Goldsmith. But it had an underlying
justification, too, in the form of the imbalance between growing demand and
shrinking supply. So it is not surprising that World Gold Council figures
showing demand growth tapering off caused some bulls to have second
thoughts. Anecdotal evidence suggests there has been particular resistance
in developing countries to prices over Dollars 400 an ounce. Gold may now
require a relatively long period of consolidation before establishing itself
comfortably above that level.
Sentiment was further undermined yesterday by rumours of a large official
sale from China. Such rumours are notoriously difficult to pin down in a
market as opaque as gold. But they have at least the ring of plausibility,
given that country's need to mobilise liquid foreign exchange. A weak local
currency and the clampdown on the overheated domestic economy is a further
negative factor. It has stifled the once active trade in smuggled gold for
the retail market.
Jewellery demand in the developing world may slowly pick up again once
buyers become accustomed to higher prices. The enthusiasm with which bullion
greeted the latest ERM crisis suggests lower interest rates in Europe would
also help. Not only would the cost of holding gold fall; economic recovery
might also revive sliding jewellery demand. The determination of European
governments to hold the line on interest rates, though, suggests such
comforting news will be slow in coming.

<TEXT>
Early days it may be, but the merger between Reed and Elsevier seems to be
developing in the finer traditions of Anglo-Dutch combines, such as Royal
Dutch Shell and Unilever, than the more fraught Anglo-French liaisons such
as CarnaudMetalbox and Arjo Wiggins Appleton. A 15 per cent increase in
interim net income on sales up just 1 per cent at constant exchange rates
illustrates the smooth progress. This is especially reassuring as Reed
Elsevier has received little help from its markets and no rationalisation
profits from the merger so far.
A closer look through the microscope, though, reveals a few worrying
blemishes. A 50 per cent profits fall in medical publishing is a smear on
the slide suggesting suppositions about the stability of underlying earnings
may be exaggerated. Conversely, the muted US recovery hints that Reed
Elsevier's presumed sensitivity to an advertising upswing may also be
over-rated. Meanwhile, fears about VAT being extended in the UK may worry
shareholders, no matter how limited the longer term impact of such a move
would be. The merger's rationale, though, will only fully prove itself if
Reed Elsevier takes bigger bites out of the publishing industry than either
party could have managed individually. The acquisition of Editions
Techniques is a tasty appetiser. It may be supplemented later this year if
Official Airline Guides can be secured. But until such promise is realised,
the company's shares may do no more than track the sector.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays' large provisions on its US business plays into the hands of those
who argue that it has underprovided in the past. The bank admits that it
decided on the provisions only after a close review of businesses which it
intends to get out of. Admittedly, there is tactical sense in marking down
such assets ahead of sale, but there cannot be many problems in the US which
were not apparent at the end of last year. One wonders what similar close
inspection of other parts of its loan book would reveal. After the shocks of
1992, a loss of Pounds 60m on US mortgage processing business seems almost
trivial and was presented with scant apology. It is a large amount
nonetheless, and there is a prospect of more to come. That will be another
blot on Barclays' record, which is a pity because in other ways things are
looking up. UK bad debt provisions are 20 per cent below the first half of
last year. Unless the US experience is a harbinger of further second
thoughts, the fall in Barclays' provisions may not this time lag that of
other banks.
As with its competitors, the rise in dealing profits may not last, but
Barclays looks well-placed in terms of operating profit, not least because
of the benefit of cost-savings to come. Much of this recovery may already be
in the price, but a market capitalisation just below that of National
Westminster and first-half operating profit nearly 10 per cent higher helps
justify its relatively lower yield.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell's rough handling by the market yesterday was a little surprising,
given that profits were at the top end of expectations once restructuring
and currency losses had been stripped out. Perhaps it was because BP's
figures are viewed with the indulgence granted to a recovery stock. Never
mind that Shell has a recovery programme as effective as BP's, Shell is seen
as the giant tortoise. Yet that is unfair. Shell is strongly represented in
buoyant areas such as US natural gas and east Asian oil refining and is less
exposed to the falling crude price than BP. Some further switching from BP
to Shell seems in order.
BP, of course, can with some justice flaunt its progress towards meeting the
targets it set when the dividend was cut a year ago. The generosity of the
market, however, means that attention is immediately switching to what BP
will do for an encore. There is room for further corporate slimming, though
some of the benefits doubtless will be lost to competitive pressures. The
dividend question also cannot be ducked much longer. Since BP yields so much
less than Shell, investors will soon be asking when their above average
dividend growth is going to arrive.
However necessary BP's retrenchment, it is not sufficient to secure the
longer term. BP makes a virtue of necessity when it argues that extra
capital is not needed because investment opportunities are thin on the
ground. They must be found if BP is not to fall behind the competition.
There remains a nagging suspicion that once BP collects its gold star for
beating last year's targets, the capital-raising bowl will not be far
behind.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Breaking up was the easy part: Anthony Robinson on the
contrasting fortunes of the Czech Republic and Slovakia since their 'velvet
divorce'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both Czechs and Slovaks sat glumly together behind what Winston Churchill
called the 'iron curtain' - from Stettin on the Baltic to Trieste on the
Adriatic. Now, to the dismay of most Slovaks, the new 'paper curtain'
created by Germany's tougher asylum laws leaves their state on the eastern
side of the new division of Europe - and their former compatriots in the
west.
The consequences of such a development were not foreseen when Czechs and
Slovaks parted company on January 1 and the invisible dividing line between
the two components of the former unitary federal state became an
international border. But the willingness of Germany's eastern neighbours -
mainly the Czech Republic and Poland - to act as a sieve, filtering out
would-be economic emigrants to Germany from the Balkans and the former
Soviet Union before they reach Germany's own borders, has turned the
Czech/Slovak border into an east-west dividing line.
This is fine for the Czech Republic, which juts like a wedge between Austria
and unified Germany. Its baroque and renaissance cities are a magnet for
western tourists and investors eager to relocate their factories just over
the Czech border, where wage rates are far lower. But it is bad news for
Slovakia and Mr Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister who led this small
country of 5m people to independence, but did not reckon on this degree of
exclusion.
For months after the 'velvet divorce' Mr Meciar objected to Czech proposals
to reinforce a border which left Slovakia in the second division of former
communist Europe. But in talks with Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime
minister, at last month's summit of central European states in Budapest, the
Slovak leader agreed to joint Czech-Slovak border patrols, clearer
demarcation of the border and restrictions on the number of border posts
open to foreigners - provided that this did not affect the rights of Czechs
and Slovaks with identity cards to cross the border freely without passport
formalities.
Although the agreement ensures that the border remains physically of little
consequence for Czech or Slovak citizens, its psychological significance is
much greater. It marks the limit of the Czech Republic's exposure to the
east while making Slovakia appear as a mere appendix of western Europe, its
eastern border joined to the economically distressed Ukraine and linked via
the Danube to the unstable Balkans.
Despite the obvious desire of both sides not to aggravate relations between
two closely related peoples, the first few months of separate statehood have
shown how economic, geopolitical and unexpected factors (such as the German
asylum laws) have combined to accelerate the course of development in
opposite directions.
Before the 'velvet divorce', Slovak nationalists complained that seven
decades of cohabitation had left Slovakia as little more than a maker of
components and industrial products, such as steel, which it sold mainly to
the Czech Republic. With independence, they believed, Slovakia would finally
be able to sell more of its products abroad.
It has not been so. Since the divorce, two-way trade between the two
republics has fallen by 40 per cent. But the slowdown in continental Europe
has made expansion into western markets more difficult for both, in
particular Slovakia.
For the Czech Republic, the Kcs8.8bn drop in exports to Slovakia in the five
months to May was a factor in the 2.3 per cent drop in first-quarter gross
domestic product. But Mr Jan Vik, deputy governor of the Czech central bank,
says that Czech exports to other markets rose by Kcs11.5bn over the same
period. Slovakia, whose only direct contact with western markets is across
its short border with Austria, lacks the flexibility to seek new markets for
its more limited range of products.
Last month Mr Julius Toth, the finance minister, gave up a six-month
struggle to maintain the parity of the Slovak crown with the Czech currency.
After rejecting the suggestion of the International Monetary Fund in
February for a 30 per cent devaluation, he finally acquiesced in a decision
of the new independent central bank to devalue by 10 per cent on July 9.
Shortly afterwards, the IMF agreed a Dollars 90m soft loan. Independent
economists and foreign observers expect further measures in the autumn, such
as a 20 per cent import surcharge, as recommended by Mr Toth, or further
devaluation, or both, designed to boost exports.
International institutions, including the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, have pledged in excess of Dollars 100m to help finance
privatisation and infrastructure projects. But private foreign investors
remain elusive. Before the split, Slovakia received only 10 per cent of
foreign investment into Czechoslovakia. It has received little since.
Even the biggest of Slovakia's deals, Volkswagen's DM35m (Pounds 13.6m)
investment in an assembly plant in Bratislava, is now seen by industry
ministry officials as of ambiguous value. They see it as mainly designed to
keep General Motors and other potential investors out of a market they
believe VW intends to dominate through its controlling stake in Skoda
Automobilova, based in the Czech Republic.
The contrast between development in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic is
stark. The Czech bankruptcy law passed in April has not yet led to the
expected shake-out of loss-making state enterprises. But preparations are
advanced for the launch of a second wave of mass privatisation. This will
concentrate on the sale of utilities and companies such as the breweries
which were once viewed as crown jewels. Prague is awash with tourists while
foreign investment, which topped Dollars 1bn in the three years before the
split, is rising again after a hiatus.
Two of the Czech Republic's biggest companies, for example, have signed
agreements with top German groups, positioning themselves for the eventual
recovery of demand in the former Soviet Union for Czech trams and other
engineering products. AEG-Westinghouse has joined up with CKD of Prague to
form AEG-CKD Transport Systems, with a turnover of DM170m which is projected
to rise to DM300m by 1995. The venture will build trams for both the western
and eastern markets. Meanwhile, Skoda Pilsen has teamed up with Siemens to
make steam turbines. Skoda Pilsen has also recently formed a consortium with
12 other Czech companies to resume arms production for the domestic market
and export.
The arms decision illustrates how far the Czech Republic under the
leadership of Mr Vaclav Klaus has moved away from the romantic liberalism
espoused by those who led the 'velvet revolution' in November 1989. One of
the first acts of the post-communist government was to renounce
Czechoslovakia's traditional pre-eminence in arms production. (Most arms
plants were in Slovakia and this decision was an important factor leading to
the separation of the two states.) Now the remaining link with the recent
past is President Vaclav Havel, whose dream of a caring revolution has been
submerged by a nationwide desire to get rich quick.
The clearest indicator of how both countries are faring can be seen in the
differing fortunes of the two men who emerged from the general elections in
June 1992 as the undisputed leaders of their respective parties and
countries.
Mr Klaus, who led his Civic Democratic Party to victory on a platform of
market reform and individual choice, has become even more outspoken in
support of foreign investment, privatisation and market choice. His open
contempt for those unable to shake off their pseudo-Marxist attitudes earns
him respect rather than affection. But the polls show him to be more popular
than ever, while his social democrat opponents concede they have little
chance of unseating him at the next election in 1995.
By contrast Mr Meciar, who never actually promised independence but enticed
nearly 40 per cent of the Slovak electorate into believing that a vote for
him was a vote for national pride and prosperity, looks increasingly like a
man who won a prize but does not know what to do with it. The populist, who
appears increasingly like the communist apparatchiks of old, seems unable to
sketch out a viable future for the country. He is sliding down the polls as
his former supporters contemplate an uncertain future at the ragged edge of
Europe.

Barclays Bank bosses, anxious to find some good news in yesterday's interim
figures, were crowing about a new computer system which monitors unusual
transactions. It prompts staff to ring up customers and ask them when they
last saw their card.
Sir Peter Middleton, the deputy chairman, was the first to sing the praises
of the Fraud 2000 system. Having transferred some money to his daughter in
Africa, and paid for a holiday, he got a worried call from Barclaycard. Not
to be outdone, Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman, added his tale of a chum
whose card was used in Paris and whose family was called by the bank to
check.
'In fact, he was on a spending spree in Paris,' added Buxton. Much merriment
ensued until the the full implications dawned. Not every Barclaycard owner
would be thrilled to learn that an unusual transaction in Paris prompts a
check call to base. Sounds like the system could do with a bit more
fine-tuning.

Guess what the Brazilian press focused on when Citicorp boss John Reed met
Itamar Franco, president of Brazil, the other day?
Perhaps it was too much to expect the Brazilians to highlight the recovering
fortunes of what used to be the world's premier international bank. Reed, as
president of Brazil's largest creditor bank, had thought his visit would
sharpen interest on negotiations over Brazil's Dollars 44bn commercial debt.
However, one of Brazil's eagle-eyed paparazzi spotted that Reed's well-worn
shoes had been repaired with rubber heels.
Quick as a flash, pictures of the offending footwear were splashed all over
yesterday's front-pages sparking a national debate over the importance of
being decently shod. Brazilian style-setters leapt to Reed's defence saying
his 'battered look' was just right for the difficult economic times of the
1990s. But the more serious journalists quickly homed in on the real
message. In a throwaway society, Reed was making a personal statement about
the need for austerity.

It will take more than a big miscalculation of the UK balance of payments
figures to trip up the slick-willies at the new-look Central Statistical
Office. Far from being embarrassed at the size of the Pounds 2.9bn downwards
revision to the provisional estimate for last year's current account
deficit, the CSO was glowing with pride at the tininess of its 'balancing
item'.
This is the euphemistic name given by statisticians to what is otherwise
known as the black hole - the difference between the current and capital
accounts which in theory, but rarely in practice, add up. Last year there
was only Pounds 301m in the black hole, compared with Pounds 7.3bn in 1990 -
the smallest figure since 1975. So no more rude suggestions, please, that
CSO boss Bill Maclennan may have failed to meet his performance targets.

<TEXT>
Like a jilted lover who won't give up, the Labour party is trying yet again
to win the affections of a steadfastly sceptical business community. The
high-point of the on-off affair comes in November, when Labour leader John
Smith parades in front of the Confederation of British Industry's annual
conference in Harrogate.
It will be a first for a Labour leader out of power and he must be hoping
his speech, reminiscent of CBI boss Howard Davies' cheeky performance at the
TUC last year, will prove more successful than previous Labour attempts to
woo industry. The job of preaching to the seemingly unconvertible has
exasperated Labour industry and treasury spokesmen, from Roy Hattersley and
Bryan Gould to Gordon Brown and Smith himself.
Indeed, Smith's own, ineffective efforts as shadow chancellor to woo the
City handed Michael Heseltine one of his best Commons put-downs, when he
ridiculed Smith's prawn-cocktail offensive, claiming that 'never have so
many crustaceans died for so little'.
So it comes as no surprise to hear that Robin Cook, Hezza's opposite number,
is already preparing a fall back position if the big boys won't rise to
Labour's bait. He and his colleague Derek Fatchett have set off on a
nationwide tour to sell the party's industry 'green paper'.
But, this time, small businesses are to be singled out for special
attention. Labour reckons the sector has had such a mauling under the Tories
that converts will be ripe for the picking.
But then it thought that before the last election.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Faster roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEASURES announced yesterday to speed up Britain's tortuous
road-building process are welcome. Even those who oppose new roads should
benefit from steps to reduce the duration of the blight that afflicts their
property. Reducing the delays in the planning process will not mean a
significant acceleration in road-building: less red tape and fewer delays
could save on costs, but there is no new money to fund a substantial
increase in the roads programme.
The creation of a Highways Agency is a sensible move. Across Whitehall,
agencies have brought improvements in public services through a clearer
focus on the job to be done. Putting distance between ministers and the
managers of the roads programme should free the latter from day-to-day
political interference.
Similarly, separating the Department of Transport from the road-building
programme should improve transport policymaking. The close identification of
the department's mandarins with the road-building programme has led to
accusations of bias against alternative forms of transport such a rail.
Hiving off roads into a separate agency will make it easier to shake off the
image of 'Department for Roads'.
Streamlining the planning process and speeding up public inquiries are also
to be welcomed. It is absurd in the computer age that inquiries should be
required to read out all written objections. Inquiries that drag on are at
the mercy of those with the time and inclination to take advantage of the
opportunities for delay. The losers include the often greater numbers of
people who live in towns and villages in need of bypasses. Motorists suffer,
too, through delay and congestion, as do industry and businesses that rely
on road transport.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, expects tens of millions of
pounds to be saved by greater efficiency in road-building. He may be right,
though this would be small beer in comparison with the Pounds 1.4bn spent
annually on new roads. So those who see speeding up road-building as
producing more roads are likely to be disappointed. The new measures could
mean that priority roads are completed more quickly, but that will be at the
expense of those further down the list.
However, shortening the time taken to build new roads improves the chances
of raising private finance for road-building. The delays and uncertainties
in the current planning process are disincentives to investors. The more the
government can do to reduce the risk associated with project planning, the
greater the chances that the private sector will invest in new roads.
What is also needed is to generate a stream of income from new trunk roads
to repay the investors. Whether that is politically saleable will depend on
the response to Mr MacGregor's green paper on tolling trunk roads, published
earlier in the summer.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Spain after the hard ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government has good reason to feel pleased, as well as relieved,
at the outcome of Europe's latest currency crisis. A week ago, the peseta's
days in the exchange rate mechanism appeared to be numbered and the
government's European ambitions looked increasingly precarious. But the
shift to dirty floating, with very wide exchange rate bands, appears, at
least for the moment, to have let the Spanish government off the hook.
For Spain, the collapse of the hard ERM could prove to be a blessing in
disguise. Maintaining the ERM parity has risked becoming an excuse for
avoiding the necessary domestic steps to stabilise the economy. That Spanish
inflation remains stuck at 5 per cent a year, despite three years of ERM
membership and a deepening recession, is proof that the ERM discipline could
not, of itself, bring inflation under control.
The hard part of Spain's journey to European convergence starts now. With
the exchange rate no longer an adequate discipline for policy, the risks
inherent in the structural weaknesses of the Spanish economy - its
persistent budget deficit and sclerotic labour market - become more
disturbingly apparent. Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez and his economic
ministers will not have been fooled by the peseta's relative stability over
the past few days following Tuesday's interest rate cut. Without adequate
steps to address these long-term issues, attempts to revive economic growth
by cutting interest rates could rapidly undermine the peseta and scupper
Spain's convergence plans.
Whether Mr Gonzalez and his team have either the stomach, or the political
support, to take the medicine remains, at best, unproven. But yesterday's
announcement that the government will cut Pta100bn (Pounds 480m) from its
planned spending this year does not bode well. The package of cuts, if
enacted, will only go a small way towards offsetting this year's budget
overshoot.
Even more worrying is the slow progress towards an agreement on wages in
either the public or private sectors. The medium-term imperative, if the
Spanish government wants to revive employment growth, reduce long-term
unemployment and control the growth of temporary contracts, is to relax
Spain's stifling and expensive hire-and-fire legislation. But for the
moment, the priority must be to persuade unions and employers that wage
inflation above 7 per cent a year is not consistent with low inflation and
thus with Spain's European ambitions.
The Spanish government cannot afford to appear sanguine. It must make clear
to parliament and to the unions that the alternatives are either a far
tighter 1994 budget than currently planned and a concerted effort to cut
wage inflation in half, or a longer recession and even higher unemployment.
The collapse of the ERM could help trigger the revival of the Spanish
economy, but only if the new flexibility is used as a reason to take tough
decisions, not as an excuse to postpone them further.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Leading Article: US steel initiative
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT A LARGE chunk of the US steel industry is about to embark on a
radical experiment in collaborative worker-management relationships will
surprise those who remember the violent confrontations that have peppered
its history. But the big steel companies and the United Steelworkers of
America are now both fighting for their lives. They have little to lose, and
potentially something to gain, from the proposed deals.
Details of what has been agreed at Bethlehem Steel, the country's second
biggest producer, and National Steel, the fourth largest company, will
remain sketchy until the terms are ratified over the next few weeks. For
example, it is not clear whether workers are being offered guaranteed
employment, or to what extent they are being required to contribute to cost
savings on health insurance.
But it is evident that under the deals, which are to last for six years, a
two-year pay freeze and greater work flexibility will be exchanged for
improved pensions and, most dramatically, for participation in company
decision-making from the boardroom to the shop-floor.
This is not full-scale co-determination, German-style. No employee at any
level in the company will have a formal veto over management decisions. But
by linking workers' pay to profit performance and giving employees more
influence in company forums, both sides hope to create mutually reinforcing
benefits.
This is not an overnight conversion to collaboration. Ever since the bitter
1986 dispute at USX, the US's biggest producer, there have been several
small-scale experiments in new forms of pay and participation, including
most recently two deals at Inland Steel and LTV. The old line steel
companies have also looked enviously at the productivity levels achieved in
the green-field site mini-mills, and their more harmonious working methods.
As Mr Lynn Williams, the steel union president, is fond of pointing out,
nobody suffers more than the workers when a plant closes. A steel closure
often has a dramatic effect on a town, leaving poor employment prospects and
falling property values. Senior managers are usually more mobile and
employable. So the union, like some of its counterparts in the airline
industry, is ready to trade short-term gains on pay for a more productive
and secure future.
It is not yet clear that the deals will provide such a future, and USX may
be wise to hold back from following its competitors into signing up until
more is known about how they will work out in practice. Even if they do,
they may not be a model for other sectors of US manufacturing, which have
very different industrial relations histories and current prospects. But the
Clinton-appointed Dunlop Commission, which is currently reviewing the
structure of US labour law, will have some useful case studies to examine
before coming up with its report next year.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Personal View: Save the planet without costing the earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID VARNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Better in the black than clean and green'. The title of David Lascelles'
review of the new publication, Environmental profiles of European business
(July 15), encapsulates one of today's most crucial issues - how to regulate
for environmental improvement without impairing the wealth-creation on which
we all depend.
Worldwide, the liberal market economy is now accepted as the most efficient
and responsive basis for economic activity. Certainly the more successful
non-OECD economies are industrialising and developing at breathtaking pace.
Meanwhile, world population is growing at 80m a year. It is not fanciful to
project fourfold growth of the world economy over the next 30 years and a
doubling of global demand for energy and other natural resources. The impact
on the natural environment of human activity expanding at this rate
represents a formidable challenge.
The all-important question is how to devise environmental policy and
legislation which leads to a positive relationship between economic
development and environmental improvement. When founded on sound principles
and proper cost/benefit analysis, this can stimulate innovation and
ingenuity in pursuit both of environmental improvement and of market
competitiveness.
But in Britain - and Europe - the pressures on politicians to respond
rapidly to environmental concerns have led to a wave of regulation, too much
of which is ill-considered, prescriptive, and uncosted. Some of the effects
will be perverse, damaging business confidence, discouraging investment, and
driving industrial activity abroad. This will impair the very economic
development and innovation on which environmental improvement depends.
Europe's oil refining industry is a case in point. A big environmental
challenge is certainly posed by continuing growth in car use, and related
urban pollution. Influenced by US practice, and particularly by California,
the EC has been introducing progressively more stringent specifications for
automotive fuels. Yet trade-offs between different environmental objectives
have not been fully resolved. Nor have the different environmental impacts
of different vehicle emissions. Nor, indeed, has the fundamental mismatch
between the costs faced by Europe's refining industry to achieve compliance,
and the funds being generated by this industry from intensely competitive
markets.
Environmental choices are clearly illustrated by the EC requirement to lower
the sulphur content of diesel fuel. There is a trade-off between achieving
this and tackling the threat of global warming. Removing sulphur takes more
energy, which means that the additional carbon dioxide from refineries will
be about 10 times greater than the sulphur dioxide eliminated from exhausts.
This is emphatically not an excuse for inaction. We must continue to invest
in improving the quality of our environment. But we must do so with a clear
understanding of the costs and trade-offs, and with a clear order of
priorities.
Today, European refiners face having to invest more than Pounds 40bn for the
piecemeal application of tighter fuel standards. This is without a
comprehensive assessment of the costs, benefits and impacts of the package
as a whole, and without similar consideration of other options. In road
transport, these include incentives to greater fuel efficiency, more
stringent environmental standards for older vehicles, or speed controls.
Ultimately, consumers will bear the consequences, either in higher costs
passed on in the marketplace, or in reduced security of supply as Europe
becomes more dependent on imported oil products.
The current environmental debate, and much of the regulation flowing from
it, is flawed - by an unwillingness to accept how little we know, and by a
mistaken belief that improvements come at little cost. Environmental
measures are proposed which place a burden on businesses disproportionate to
their benefits. The burden affects companies' profitability,
competitiveness, costs to their customers, and ultimately the health of the
entire economy.
Political leaders must decide environmental goals and priorities. But we
have a right to expect them to do so with an informed grasp of the
implications and thorough analysis of the costs and benefits. We in business
must continue to demonstrate our commitment to real environmental
improvement, not only by harnessing technical expertise to practical
solutions, but also by clearly articulating costs and implications of
proposed measures. The environmental debate must now be conducted with a new
realism.

<TEXT>
DISASTERS, RELIEF AND THE MEDIA By Jonathan Benthall I B Tauris, Pounds
14.95, 267 pages
A press conference was held in London last week to launch the Pathfinders, a
private group of independent relief teams, intended to 'give Britain a new
ability to respond instantly to overseas natural disasters'.
The group explained at the launch that 'as well as their own, independent
insignia, teams will wear the Pathfinder badge and the Union flag'. One of
the teams was described as 'much decorated by foreign governments'. Another,
'originally earthquake-oriented, now majoring in communications', had 'held
the fort for the Foreign Office in the Hurricane Hugo operation' which
lashed the Caribbean and south-eastern US in 1989. A third 'aims to match
Medecins sans Frontieres' (MSF): one of its founders 'travelled Afghanistan
with Bernard Kouchner, disguised as Mujahadeen'.
The idea for the Pathfinders was attributed to the late Group Captain Lord
Cheshire VC and the term itself 'derives from the target-marking at which
Cheshire excelled during the second world war'.
Jonathan Benthall must be tickled by the coincidence of the group's launch
in the same week as his book, for it illustrates a number of his themes. His
main message is that almost all relief agencies are now 'majoring in
communications', since disasters, as we have come to know them, are largely
'media constructs'.
Indeed, Benthall suggests, we can hardly recognise a disaster as such unless
it is served up according to a familiar narrative pattern, with a set of
stock characters whom he identifies with the 'functions' in the classic folk
tale, as analysed by the Russian scholar Vladimir Propp.
The characters are the travelling hero, 'who may be an expatriate
fieldworker, such as an officer of Oxfam or MSF; the villain (failing Saddam
Hussein, 'lack' or misfortune will do); the dispatcher, who sends the hero
off on his mission; the donor, who provides him with a magical agent,
sometimes in the form of a magical helper ('clearly, in our case, the
embodiments of western abundance and technology in various forms'); the
false hero (fake charity, incompetent or corrupt humanitarian bureaucrat);
and the princess, who gives him his reward - literally in the case of Save
the Children Fund (SCF), whose president is the Princess Royal.
So familiar is this narrative, according to Benthall, that even when only
part of it is shown on television - 'for instance, pictures of starving
babies, or an aeroplane setting off from a familiar airport taking supplies,
or an ambassador thanking the public for their generosity' - viewers can
immediately recognise it and know what to expect.
He devotes 15 pages to the 'French doctors' movements - the prototype MSF
and its offshoots, Medecins du Monde and Aide Medicale Internationale. Their
founder, Bernard Kouchner (a minister in the last French government), crops
up throughout the book. Benthall is fascinated by the personality of
Kouchner, a crusading humanitarian who has been explicit and unashamed about
his relationship with the media, especially television.
As director of the Royal Institute of Anthropology, Benthall is naturally
interested in the different 'cultural styles' of relief agencies. He finds
that the 'French doctors' movements have a very distinctive national style,
which he calls 'flamboyant', even 'macho', and are much readier than their
British counterparts to 'ventilate disagreements in the national
newspapers'.
One of these disagreements concerns the expression 'French Doctors', which
Kouchner has adopted. His rival, Xavier Emmanuelli, a leading figure in MSF,
warns that it 'makes it possible for French politicians to take credit, in a
covertly piratical manner, for an initiative originally undertaken by
private individuals'. It sounds as though, by draping their teams in the
Union flag, Britain's new Pathfinders may actually surpass their French
model in flamboyant patriotism.
Benthall gives careful attention to the badges and 'logos' different
agencies use, explaining how the Red Cross, despite the best efforts of its
International Committee, comes to be seen as a Christian symbol, so that in
Moslem countries it has to be replaced by the Red Crescent. MSF, founded by
Kouchner in anger at the Red Cross's excessive discretion during the Biafra
war in the late 1960s, uses 'a red cross which slopes forward and is half
erased by a red squiggle: it is almost saying 'Not the Red Cross'.'
Christian Aid has 'Slim Jim', a thin human figure with tapering arms and
legs; and SCF now uses 'Charlie Brown', a stylised child with arms
outstretched above its shoulders. (Its earlier logo, a della Robbia bambino,
represented qualities of 'total dependence on paternal funding and maternal
swaddling - exactly those which a progressive agency concerned with the
rights of children today strives to combat'.)
All this may sound cynical or far-fetched, but Benthall is not just another
debunker. Nor is he simply regurgitating the neo-Marxism of some specialists
in 'media studies'. He does not belittle the reality of suffering or the
genuine self-sacrifice in most attempts to relieve it. In fact he defends
the agencies and the media, albeit mildly, against the strictures of
Professor Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan who attacks the former for wielding
influence in Africa without accountability and the latter for 'softening up
public opinion in the west to make armed intervention more acceptable'.
Benthall supports the effort to help disaster victims. But as an
anthropologist he is interested both in the way that western cultures
interrelate with those of the third world, and in the role played by images
of suffering and relief within western culture. The result is a readable and
fair-minded book, which highlights some very difficult dilemmas without
claiming to resolve them.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS MARTINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I suggest that you fundamentally underestimated the wisdom and
skill of the Bundesbank in the recent ERM turmoil?
According to your headlines and comments in the last few days, (mainly
London-based) economists, analysts and foreign exchange dealers have
repeatedly been taken by surprise by several Buba decisions. When dealers
can no longer take bets with winnings guaranteed, what better proof is there
than that the German central bank has successfully burst the speculative
bubble?
The French franc has not been devalued, nor should or will it be in the
medium term as French fundamentals look somewhat better than those in
Germany - so the second goal is about to be achieved. And the Paris-Bonn
axis has been strengthened.
Finally, the UK and some other countries have been given enough room again
to participate in the European process if they so wish. The third goal is
achieved - Cunctator Major or his successor can no longer shelter behind
allegedly irresponsible German monetary policy, but will have to make his
own strategic political decisions on the UK's place in Europe.

FT  06 AUG 93 / No reason to mourn: Currency liberation could be good news
for Europe's unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLIVIER BLANCHARD, RUDI DORNBUSCH, STAN FISCHER, PAUL KRUGMAN, FRANCO
MODIGLIANI, PAUL SAMUELSON and ROBERT SOLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the straitjacket of the exchange rate mechanism, the European economy in
1993 was lost to recession and 1994 was unlikely to see recovery. European
unemployment, already at 22m, was expected to rise in 1994 to an all-time
high. The demise of the narrow ERM now opens the door to far better
performance in most economies.
It is wrong to believe that something precious was lost last weekend; on the
contrary, the liberation of currencies previously trapped in the ERM offers
a significant opportunity to recapture the buoyant spirit that animated
Europe in the run-up to 1992.
The decision to loosen exchange margins was inevitable; central banks could
postpone, within limits and at escalating cost, the time of crisis, but not
the ultimate occurrence. The markets understood the basic dilemma: the
Bundesbank had made clear its unwillingness to cut interest rates to
preserve the existing exchange rates. Whatever the rhetoric, Denmark, Spain,
Belgium and ultimately France lacked the reserves and the resolve to sustain
exchange rates at the price of visibly and rapidly rising unemployment.
Uncertainty about the timing and extent of German interest rate cuts and the
urgent need for relief in the distressed partner countries opened up a
credibility gap. Such a situation is a standing invitation for speculators
who understand which way rates must move.
Sometimes currency speculation may deserve the bad name it has; by
prematurely hardening exchange rates, the central bankers and finance
ministers of Europe gave speculators the proverbial one-way bet. Even so, in
this case the speculators were the best friend of the unemployed, and - even
though we will not hear that admission - of the monetary officials who had
assumed unsustainable commitments.
There has undoubtedly been some loss of face for policymakers who proclaimed
that they would never devalue, but it would be wrong to dwell on that.
Rather than look back and dream of punishing speculators, officials need now
to exploit the newfound freedom to fight unemployment, of course paying due
respect to inflation risks.
The decision to maintain the format of the ERM - exchange rate margins, but
15 per cent - is sound and pragmatic. The European Monetary System was a
good convergence device for quite a while, but it hardened prematurely with
the insistence that further realignments would destroy the accumulated gain
in credibility. With limited margins and no realignments, the room for
divergent interest rate developments vanished, just at the time when high
German inflation made far more flexibility highly desirable. The wide
margins adopted in the present form can accommodate big divergences in
interest rates without the prospect of creating yet another crisis - at
least in the near future.
What strategies should countries pursue to use enlarged scope for interest
rates and currency movements? There is no common and simple answer for each
of the countries gaining freedom of manoeuvre.
All must be concerned to avoid a recurrence of inflation, a task easier for
some than for others. But they also must give urgent priority to expansion,
because that is the only way to bring down unemployment. Low interest rates
are the fastest affordable way, given actual or imagined constraints to
fiscal action, to get there. Finally, they all must look beyond recovery to
give more emphasis to the supply side; more room for incentives, more
flexibility, less status quo. But beyond these general common targets, the
differences in constraints and opportunities deserve spelling out.
France enjoys a privileged position for action. With moderate inflation, it
can go hard for growth and will succeed. France should cut interest rates
rapidly to reach a level of 4 to 5 per cent in just a few months. There is
no reason to hold off. In fact, given the long lags of monetary policy in
stimulating recovery - particularly when unaided by fiscal stimulus, as the
US demonstrates so clearly - there is no place for complacency. Even with
immediate action, it will take at least until the beginning of 1994 to see
results in terms of growth.
In the case of Belgium the need for moderate interest rates is even more
imperative. The extraordinarily high debt ratio - perhaps the highest in the
world - makes the country hypersensitive to even the appearance of
unsustainable strategies. The country has a good reputation now, but it can
lose it in no time if interest rates stay high.
Spain faces far more serious contraints. Inflation is not moderate and the
instinctive response to a weakening of the currency is a resurgence of
inflation. Of course, keeping the tight money lid on does not solve the
problem. Lower interest rates are essential; growth is paramount; the status
quo of pervasive corporatism, lack of competition and mounting unemployment
needs a co-operative frontal attack.
That there is another way is demonstrated by Switzerland, Italy and the UK.
Switzerland has interest rates of less than 5 per cent, far below Germany's.
The UK when it was pushed out of the ERM last autumn opted for growth and is
well on the way, without signs of strain or loss of financial stability.
Italy's demise at the hands of speculators became the foundation for growth
and for far-reaching domestic reform. Italy demonstrates that unions can be
far-sighted and willing to co-operate in a growth strategy that does not
translate into inflation.
Interest rate cuts cannot be accomplished without some depreciation of
currencies. Only with the expectation of an appreciation relative to the
D-Mark can a currency have lower interest rates than Germany. The practical
question then is how much the French franc, say, must decline to support
moderate interest rates. Our view is that the necessary depreciation is very
limited, perhaps 5-7 per cent. After all, France is just moving ahead of
German rate cuts by six to 12 months or so, and that hardly warrants big
swings. Much the same argument applies to Belgium and Denmark. Thus the
extent of depreciation need not be large and stabilising speculation can be
counted on to limit the fall.
There is, of course, a strong argument for limiting unnecessary volatility
and uncertainty by broadly and informally co-ordinating the strategy among
the floaters. For the most part, they should be able to cut interest rates
in line with one another, and that will limit excess volatility. Where they
part company will depend on their attitude towards unemployment, their
performance on inflation, and their success in reducing rates without overly
large depreciation.
If interest rate targeting takes advantage of the new room for letting
exchange rates move and growth resume, there is also the question of when to
tighten the margins and return to the Emu project.
The immediate priority is flexibility and that precludes formal commitments
to unsustainable exchange rate targets. There is no reason, however, to rule
out pragmatic trading ranges around newly found levels of the exchange
rates, once interest rates have been cut. Thus we do not expect extreme
volatility, just because the margins are wide. Ultimately, 18 months or two
years from now, Europeans can re-examine whether the preconditions for
stable rates or even monetary union are in place, how to remedy
shortcomings, how to assure better co-ordination, and how to proceed.
Whether ultimately there is a common money or not, a common Europe has
already shown its worth in the establishment of a market where goods and
services flow freely. The good name of Europe will be all the better if
further integration yields prosperity and not mass unemployment.

almost no new 'mainframe' sites are being started because the new 'open
systems' offer four times the price performance. The AS400 seems to be at
the end of its product life cycle, with no certain upgradeable path. PCs
have no unique IBM ability as IBM did not design its own chip. The only
product with a future is the RS6000 series, but it is falling behind its
competitors which are introducing faster parallel processors.
Finally, all big decisions regarding R&amp;D, marketing and strategy seem to be
made by the old time 'mainframers'. Can Mr Gerstner overcome the infighting
of these four groups?

FT  06 AUG 93 / Letter: Equalisation of pensions at 60 is an affordable
alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree with Howard Davies ('CBI Backs Pensions for all at 65', July
29) that the government must 'stop dithering' about when they are going to
equalise the state pension age. The TUC firmly believes equality in this
fundamental area is long overdue. Legislation must be brought forward
without delay, recommending equalisation at 60.
But Mr Davies contends that equalisation at 60 is unaffordable. This is
simply not the case. It is an argument being used by the government and
employers to frighten people into accepting they will have to work for an
extra five years. The TUC has produced figures to show that equalising at 60
could be cheaper than equalising at 65 - Pounds 0.07bn, a far cry from the
Pounds 3.5bn which the the government maintains equalising at the lower age
would cost. This is because of the knock-on effects on unemployment among
younger workers and consequential savings on social security spending.
Contrary to Mr Davies's assertions, equalising will not place unnecessary
burdens on employers. Large numbers of schemes, and many of Mr Davies's
members, have already equalised occupational scheme pension ages at 60 and
will be paying full pensions to former male and female employees. Many
others will pay early retirement pensions to men aged between 60-65, the
majority of whom do not work.
Second, the CBI's figures appear somewhat exaggerated. Separate actuarial
data put the costs to employers of equalising at 60 between Pounds
4bn-Pounds 8bn - two-thirds of the costs predicted by William M Mercer. What
is more, when considering the costs to employers, large numbers of schemes
are presently over-funded. These surpluses, which have been calculated to
run to between Pounds 15bn-Pounds 25bn, could be used to equalise
occupational scheme pension ages. This would certainly reduce the financial
burden on employers which Mr Davies complains about.
Men and women want to retire at 60, and to make them work on to 65 would be
quite unfair. This is not just the evidence of opinion polls, but can be
seen from people's current retirement patterns. We must eradicate this
discrimination in a progressive manner, by equalising at age 60. This is
fair, it is what people want and is affordable.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Letter: Social security must be more than just a safety net
for poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAREY OPPENHEIM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bill Robinson argues that social security has one role alone - to help
the poor - and that it should be reformed accordingly ('Don't pay the rich
to be ill', August 3). His argument is flawed on a number of counts.
He fails to recognise that Britain's social security system has, and must
have, a number of roles in a complex society. It fosters solidarity by
ensuring collective security against risks such as unemployment; it should
maximise opportunities for self-support; it must prevent as well as relieve
poverty, for example by smoothing income over the life-cycle.
He goes on to dismiss the insurance principle on the grounds that it is a
costly myth. But while it may be a myth in actuarial terms, it embodies an
important principle of our social security system that carries a powerful
resonance in the public's mind that we all contribute and gain. To reject it
is to embark on the creation of a social security system which is reduced to
a residual safety net.
To argue that the benefit system provides incentives to become sick,
disabled or a lone parent betrays an extraordinary ignorance of the reality
of living on meagre levels of benefit. The princely sum of Pounds 73.60 a
week for a lone parent cannot be an incentive to have a child on your own.
Bill Robinson's prime target for reform is child benefit because a 'big
share goes to the better off'. However, recent figures from a parliamentary
answer show that just 8 per cent of child benefit expenditure goes to
high-earning families once income is adjusted for family size. This is
because families with children are clustered at the middle and lower ends of
the income distribution. If the government chooses to target the more
affluent it should look closely at the system of tax allowances, reliefs and
higher rates.
The recent growth of the social security budget is not primarily due to the
national insurance principle or perverse incentives but largely because of
pressures outside the social security budget, in particular the recession,
and also the costs of deregulation in the housing market. Even the growth of
lone parents, sick and disabled is related to the state of the economy -
their reliance on benefits rises in recessions. The government's own
document, The Growth of Social Security, shows that, if Britain's economy
continues to grow, we can afford our social security system.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Strauss celebrated - Opera in San Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PFAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a great pity that the Celebration of Richard Strauss that has just
ended is, for budget reasons, the last San Francisco Opera summer season for
the foreseeable future. Since, despite a high level of singing, there were
no standout performances in major roles, the company's orchestra emerged the
festival's 'star.' Now it seems that without this valuable performance and
rehearsal time with its new music director, Donald Runnicles (who conducted
Salome and Capriccio), and principal guest, Charles Mackerras (who led Der
Rosenkavalier), the opera orchestra can only suffer.
The ensemble's alert responses to early, middle and late Strauss, as well to
three conductors (Andrew Davis led two concert performances of Daphne), was
appreciable. But its versatility shone brightest in adversity: having to
sound at full cry for Salome while holding back to accommodate the severely
compromised performance of Maria Ewing in the title role.
The old question of whether it was wise for Ewing to take up the role for
the by now much-travelled Peter Hall production seems answerable in an
unambiguous 'No.' Not only can the Ewing soprano no longer soar over the
full orchestra at climaxes, it skips over many of the 'little notes' that
lend the role so much of its musical interest. From performance to
performance (I heard two), Ewing recomposed the part for her comfort; little
wonder that, her famous strip to the buff notwithstanding, the most
memorable part of her Salome is her pout.
The Herods fared far better, with both Robert Tear and Leonie Rysanek giving
sophisticated, richly detailed vocal and dramatic readings - and Rysanek
sounding as if she could have sung the title role with ease. If Tom Fox's
Jokanaan lacked a certain aura of mystery, it was still strong and
impressive - even if the often misguided restaging by Jeanette Aster gave us
a prophet who could not keep his eyes off the sultry princess.
What Runnicles' Salome offered in sound and fury, his Capriccio delivered in
subtlety and nuance. Except for some occasionally faulty intonation from the
strings his players produced a shimmering tapestry of sound. Revisions to
the Mauro Pagano production, similarly familiar to London audiences from a
previous Covent Garden outing, will be revealed in a live video recording.
In general it seemed improved by Thierry Bosquet's period costumes,
replacing the misogynist Versace designs that lent visual confusion to the
original production.
Kiri Te Kanawa sounded better too; by now having learned the role in its
particulars, she is singing it half-ardently. Still, opulent sounds and
arching phrases were not enough to convince one that she had strong, let
alone conflicted, feelings about either words or music. The production's one
genuinely touching performance was Michel Senechal's Monsieur Taupe. Hakan
Hagegard, as the Count, and Victor Braun, as La Roche, made similar, if
paler, impressions compared with their first outings in this production.
While David Kuebler caught neither the character of Flamand nor his music,
Simon Keenlyside compensated with a beautifully inflected, deeply
sympathetic Olivier. Still, the most fullest, most rewarding
characterisation was Tatiana Troyanos' text-savoring, handsomely sung
Clairon.
The already grateful pairing of Capriccio and Der Rosenkavalier was further
enhanced by a similarity in production style. Lotfi Mansouri's 'new'
Rosenkavalier sought to recreate both the Alfred Roller designs of the
Dresden premiere and the original staging as reflected in the production
book. The sets emerged breath-catchingly, absorbingly beautiful, the
direction a bit by the numbers and characteristically broad and physical.
Felicity Lott introduced an accurate, well-defined, patrician and ultimately
unmoving Marschallin; Frederica von Stade her well-known, urgent Octavian
(though a bit vocally constricted and, well, more mannish than boyish in her
late San Francisco debut of the role); and Christina Schaefer a perky if
small-voiced Sophie. Eric Halvorson's sumptuously voiced Ochs seemed
otherwise generic.
Musically, the show belonged to Mackerras, who seemed unerring in his
choices of what to accent in this busiest of scores - while making sure that
all its music told. His sympathy with the singers seemed sometimes
finer-grained than theirs with their characters.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are, like it or not, celebrating Romeo and Juliet year in London. The
Kirov ballet has just shown us its rickety version of the Lavrovsky
original. Birmingham Royal Ballet brought its staging of MacMillan's
choreography to Covent Garden on Wednesday (more of this anon). Next week
English National Ballet offers the Ashton production on the South Bank. And,
unsurprisingly, the Royal Ballet will also present the MacMillan Romeo as
the autumn season begins at the Royal Opera House. These tiresome facts
indicate the extent to which ballet companies now rely upon the tried and
true - and predictable - to hold an audience. The triumph of the obvious is
the death of repertory.
But I record with pleasure that the admirable BRB triple bill last week of
Job, Choreartium, Concerto, brought an enthusiastic public to the Opera
House: there was a sense of excitement and interest which recalled happier
and more adventurous days of three decades ago when Swan Lake and Romeo were
not the only works the public seemed able to enjoy.
Birmingham acquired its staging of Romeo last year. The new designs by Paul
Andrews are handsome, as I reported at the first performance, and the
lighting by Hans-Ake Sjoquist is exemplary. The problem when this version
was first mounted, and it is one which I still noticed on Wednesday night,
has to do with the density, even the scale, of the company performances.
This is a production in which interpretations look smaller, lighter, than
those we know with the Royal Ballet. Some BRB readings are excellent: I
think Anita Landa's Nurse superb as a portrait of a jolly, fussy, loving old
servant; Alain Dubreuil's Laurence is a real priest - he knows how to give
people a blessing - and, as always with this rare artist, believable at
every moment. But many of the secondary roles looked eager where they should
be weighty with emotion, and choreographic outlines were diminished.
Birmingham's artists, so secure as an ensemble and so ready for any
challenge, here rush every fence. MacMillan's dances need to be explored
more fully.
But the heart of the ballet - which is Juliet's heart - beat strong and true
in Marion Tait's interpretation. Tait is our finest dance actress, incapable
of lying in any role, showing us its secrets through playing clear, potent.
There is, in everything, a lovely modesty to her work. Nothing is done for
vain effect. She serves her character, as she has served her art and her
company, with entire sincerity, and her performances are memorable because
of this. Dramatic insight is matched by a physical intelligence. Sir Kenneth
MacMillan gave her roles that she illuminated - I wish BRB would revive
Playground, in which her anguish still haunts me - and her Juliet is in the
very best traditions.
Juliet's opening moments with the doll are difficult, and on this occasion,
too skittish. Thereafter, the ballet is grandly Tait's. The ecstasy of first
love, youthful passion, and - most poignantly - the bravery and resignation
of the last act, were infinitely touching. A sudden blaze of temperament
before she yielded to Paris; the terrible silent scream as she realised
Romeo is dead, were moments uniquely indicative of Marion Tait's gifts. It
was a wholly truthful interpretation. Her Romeo was the guest artist Robert
Hill, giving an honest and attentive account of himself. The score sounded
very well from the Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Philip Ellis.
Birmingham Royal Ballet plays Romeo and Juliet with varied casting until the
end of this week

FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Godspell - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the 1971 rock musical Godspell was new here, I was too sophisticated to
go to see it. Now that my brow has dropped a bit, I have been looking
forward to catching up with a show that so moved many of my generation. But
you would have to have your brow around your ankles to take this revival
seriously. It is pointless, it is insincere, its Jesus story here is
virtually stripped of plot, and Jesus himself becomes (a) a joyless wimp and
(b) a pontificating creep.
And - worst crime in a musical - the songs are sold short. You hear
spirituals without spirit, soul anthems without soul, rock numbers without
rock. Music and text have been heftily revised. The show wants to recapture
the feeling of 1971, yet also wants to be tuned in to Now. (Someone even
says 'Fatted calf? Oh - Paul Gascoigne.') Everyone onstage is dressed in the
way-in Carnaby Street gear of pre-'71 fashion (the nastiest bellbottoms I've
seen in 20 years), but one of them makes a joke about wearing Reeboks.
The disciples keep re-telling Jesus's parables in various showbiz guises.
The Prodigal Son story is like a Crimebusters report; and the story of seed
cast upon stony, weedy, or fertile ground is re-told like an episode of
Blind Date. Usually these comic turns seem only to send up Jesus's original
stories. Yet at least they are lively, whereas Jesus himself is a drab. When
he explains to 'Cilla' that she has missed the point of Blind Date's seed
parable, you want the ground to swallow him up.
Cilla, as it happens, is imitated with happy panache by Gemma Craven, who is
also the only interesting singer in the cast of 12. As soon as she starts to
sing 'Day by Day,' you know that here is a properly supported voice,
individual in timbre, singing calmly and steadily, but with a simple
authority that actually sounds heartfelt. (Pity about her hairdo.) However,
the way the show wastes her talents is beyond belief. In both that number
and 'By My Side,' other voices soon drown hers.
The way that other singers have been encouraged to coarsen famous songs like
'Bless the Lord' and 'Turn Back, O Man' is dismal. Andy Crane (he of
children's TV) tries, not very hard, to be Jesus; and his singing is grey,
limp and often flat. In the Garden of Gethsemane, he asks 'What? Can none of
you stay awake one hour with me?' Answer: if we can, it's no thanks to you,
dear. James Gaddas (Judas) has more sheer presence, though no more
persuasiveness. In a largely speaking role, Mark Greenstreet displays rather
more force and sexiness than you might have believed from his work on
Trainer.
But no-one could really to be said to act, and some of the cute interplay
among the ensemble is embarrassing. Both the director, Lindsay Dolan, and
the musical director, Steve Brooker, do this show no service; but since
Stephen Schwartz, the original composer, has abetted them with new lyrics,
he must take blame too.
I wonder if even in 1971 the show honestly brought off its attempt to make
the Word of God go down like a rock concert. Several of its songs are
written for real singing; but I remain suspicious of all that 1960s
God-is-for-real-man. The most interesting feature is the photos of (oh yes)
Jeremy Irons in the original London staging. Because the casting and
dialogue have been adjusted to ingratiate an audience steeped in modern TV,
this Barbican revival will have some limited success. Nothing, however,
about the first-night ovation was spontaneous.
At the Barbican Hall until August 30

For a long time the dud night of the week on television was Saturday. Even
now you could scarcely call the Saturday schedule compelling, but at least
it is not as bad as Friday's. Tonight BBC1 screens repeats of Dad's Army,
Casualty, and Critters. ITV shows an absurd American drama series called Dr
Quinn: Medicine Woman which smears 1960s feminism like an impenetrable layer
of margarine over stories of the Wild West in the 1860s; and another drama
series called Stay Lucky which 'stars' Dennis Waterman who seems to have
picked up all his acting skills at Ealing Studios before he was out of short
trousers.
BBC2 shows the second in its series Architecture Of The Imagination. If you
thought that Programme 1 provided remarkable insights into the significance
and symbolism of the door, then doubtless you will want to watch today's
episode about the staircase.
Channel 4 continues with its worthy but saddening 'Bloody Bosnia' season and
begins another series of the unimpressive American comedy Nurses.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Second-hand images of the human body - Lynn MacRitchie
reviews the work of Marlene Dumas at the ICA gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chimera that artists, especially younger ones, no longer paint, or if
they do they certainly do not paint people, hovers over much current chatter
about the visual arts. It is, of course, so much nonsense. The human figure
is still the chosen subject of many young painters, although they may not
approach it in the traditional manner of, say, Lucien Freud, whose lifetime
contemplation of the model in the studio will be celebrated at the
Whitechapel Gallery this autumn.
A considerable group of young artists in the US such as Raymond Pettibon or
Mike Kelley (some of whom were represented at the excellent 'Irony &amp;
Ecstasy' show at the Salama Caro Gallery in London earlier this summer) are
using drawing and painting to explore the representation of the figure.
Their source material, however, is much more likely to be found in the
detritus of contemporary media images of the body, porn magazines, comic
books and advertisements, than in the life class.
In Europe, the leading exponent of this school of figuration is Marlene
Dumas, whose powerful and disturbing work can now be seen at the ICA.
Like many painters of the human form before her (Degas or Manet to name but
two), Dumas chooses to work from photographs. Unlike them, she works
exclusively from photographic images, either taken by herself with a
Polaroid camera or found in the pages of books, newspapers or magazines.
These make up a store of images from which she selects, exploring their
possibilities in series of oil paintings and watercolour drawings. 'It is
not the relationship between painting and photography that is the most
prominent question today,' she explains. 'The fact is that the photographic,
not photography as a specific medium but as a particular mode of signifying,
is affecting all the arts at the moment.'
Her subjects, even before she begins to work on them, have already been
through one process of transformation, leaving her free to remake them anew
in paint, or, as she expresses it, 'My people were all shot by a camera,
framed, before I painted them. They didn't know I'd do this to them . . .'
The earliest works in the show are portrait heads, of family, friends and
strangers, painted in light washes of intense colour. Titles are important.
'Evil is banal,' 1984, shows a young woman whose orange gold hair stands out
in Bonnard-like contrast against a pale pink cheek and purple shadowed
shoulder. A large nude of 1987 titled 'The Particularity of Nakedness' is
the only male example in a series of studies of a horizontal, naked figure,
and the only one to function as a portrait, whose subject, echoing, Manet's
'Olympia', returns the viewer's stare.
Others show a naked woman, lying prone across a table in 'Waiting for
Meaning' 1988, or, in 'Snowhite and the broken arm' representing the artist,
prone, helpless, polaroids scattered on the floor, camera clutched in her
useless hand, unable to shoot back at the greedy gaze of seven small boys.
The next series is scenes of children, photographed at school, in obedient
lines or groups. 'The Dance', 1992, shows four little girls, seen from the
back, hand in hand before an empty, threatening space. Little girls remain a
dominant theme in her later work, while 'The First Humans' 1991, portrays
four new born babies in studies the size of full length adult portraits. Her
latest works are based on photographs from porn magazines.
At Documenta 9 in Kassel last year, Dumas filled a tiny turret room with
monochrome watercolour sketches of young girls, a series based on the story
of Salome. After the wide installation filled spaces below, their intimacy
was a shock, like finding oneself suddenly naked in front of strangers, a
state which although inadvertent may provoke harm. That is the condition of
Dumas' subjects. Caught first by the camera, then by the painter, something
indeed has been 'done' to them. In the process of their double
objectification, they have been transformed. These babies are not innocent,
but redolent with the possibility of evil. These children line up smiling in
the playground and we see gas chambers. The stained sheet held out labelled
'Evidence of Virtue' signifies its opposite, innocence betrayed. The 'Peer
Group' child exposed naked by her playmates horrifies us with our own
thoughts of abuse.
All this is done with the simplest of means - naked bodies suggested by a
swift wash of watercolour in a manner which recalls the grace and economy of
Beuys, a use of oil paint in which sombre strokes of grey and blue are
pulled into meaning by vibrant details - the scarlet slippers in 'The
Window', 1991, or the shocking pink mouth of 'Girl with Lipstick', 1992.
Dumas' painterly exploration of these second-hand images of the body reminds
us that all human horrors have already been committed, recorded and wait
only to be repeated, by people just like ourselves. Only the porno
performers seem innocent, the watercolour sketches of their endless,
wearying display finally returning their bodies to the mystery of the
unknowable.

FT  06 AUG 93 / The Bank settles on a panel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has named a panel of the great and the good to consider
the best way forward for its CREST project, the successor to the unfortunate
Taurus scheme.
CREST, which is an acronym for nothing at all, aims to reduce the period for
settlement of equities transactions to at most five days and smooth the way
for paperless share trading.
The Panel, to be chaired by Pen Kent, Associate Director at the Bank of
England, includes the great and the good, and perhaps more importantly,
representatives of parts of the industry with the greatest commercial
interest in the project.
Among the members are Brian Finnegan, head of settlement operations at the
London Stock Exchange - which, Kent has suggested, may have little role to
play in securities settlement post-Crest. Also on the Panel is Ralph
Walrond, chief registrar at Lloyds Bank Registrars which has the lion's
share of the UK share registration market.
Other members include Terry Pearson, senior securities adviser at Royal Bank
of Scotland Securities Services, the largest independent custodian for UK
pension funds, Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays Bank, Hector
Sants, vice chairman at UBS, Scott Dobbie, joint chairman of NatWest
Securities, Andrew Palmer, finance director at Legal and General life and
pensions division, Geoff Newman, vice president at one of the world's
largest global custodians, Chase Manhattan, and Mike Jones, director of
Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management and a member of the Private Client
Investment Managers and Stockbrokers Association.

FT  06 AUG 93 / People: BT moves Earnshaw to US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Earnshaw has been appointed to head the Dollars 1bn joint venture
between British Telecommunications and MCI, the US operator, launched with
great fanfare in June.
The joint venture, for which BT is putting up most of the cash, is designed
to fight AT&amp;T, the US giant, in the emerging global market for providing
'one-stop' advanced telecommunications services to the world's
multinationals.
It still has to be christened, but as well as a chief executive, it now has
a home - Washington, a clear signal of BT's determination to expose its
offspring to the dynamic US telecoms market at birth.
At only 39, Earnshaw's ascent through BT has been meteoric. Joining the Post
Office (as it then was) straight from school in 1972, he earned a physics
degree the hard way as a mature student at Sheffield University.
His early career was in network modernisation. In 1988 he was given
responsibility for BT's technology and systems engineering for its network,
and a year later appointed Director, Networking.
His current job, managing director of Worldwide Networks, has given him a
key role in planning BT's global strategy.
Earnshaw formally takes up the post on the formation of the new company,
sometime next year. But he will be starting the work as soon as he gets back
from a short holiday - destination unknown.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Management: A shock to the system - German shareholders are
starting to reject their boards'  traditional lack of accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The depth of the German recession is prompting unprecedented questioning of
the country's system of corporate governance.
It is the equivalent of more formalised debates in the US and the UK that
were touched off after a series of corporate failures and scandals
highlighted weaknesses in the 'Anglo-Saxon', stock market-centred form of
capitalism.
In the UK the soul-searching led to the publication of a code of good
practice, which was issued last December by the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance. In the US a number of financial institutions have
taken the initiative to change the management of companies that they believe
have been performing poorly.
The effects of the debate in Germany have been varied.
There has been increased shareholder activism, notably by Professor Ekkehard
Wenger, of the University of Wurzburg, who was recently ejected from the
annual meeting of Daimler-Benz after he made a vehement attack on the
company's management.
Calpers, the large US investment fund, intervened at the annual shareholders
meeting of RWE, the German utilities-based conglomerate. The fund's
spokesman condemned the navete of the German company for expecting to be
able to raise cash in international capital markets at the same time as
having an anachronistic capital structure restricting shareholders' voting
influence.
A further symptom of the corporate governance debate is the willingness of
managers to think the unthinkable. For example, board members of Deutsche
Bank and Daimler-Benz have hinted that the bank should reduce its 28 per
cent stake in the industrial group. The two deny any concrete plans for such
a move, but the fact that the issue is being talked about in public casts
doubt about one of the most stable relationships in German capitalism.
Deutsche has owned the stake since 1926.
Meanwhile, German managers pepper their press conferences with buzzwords
such as 'investor relations' and 'shareholder value', which imply that the
interests of long-suffering shareholders are beginning to be taken more
seriously. And a highly critical book about German management entitled
Nieten in Nadelstreifen, or Nitwits in Pin-stripe Suits*, has been at the
top of bestseller lists for months, its note of self-doubt capturing the
mood of the times.
Critics of the system are united in believing that senior managers are
shielded from the pressure to perform - at least as measured by reported
profits and other financial criteria such as dividend growth.
With the exception of Krupp's purchase of rival steel group Hoesch last
year, or Pirelli's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to acquire control of
Continental tyre company, hostile takeovers are rare.
Managers sit behind legal barricades, which guarantee that they cannot be
dislodged from office. For example, devices restrict shareholder voting
rights (Stimmrechtbeshrankung), and special types of non-voting shares, such
as the 'vinculated' shares common in the insurance sector, allow management
the right to choose which shareholders acquire votes on their holdings.
Critics are unhappy with two other characteristically German features:
The two-tier board structure. Joint-stock companies are by law required to
appoint a supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) and a management board
(Vorstand). The management board is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the company, while the supervisory board, comprising
representatives of both shareholders and employees, oversees management
performance according to its own criteria. It also appoints senior
management and, in some circumstances, has the right to veto important
commercial decisions.
Strong relationships between Germany's bigger banks and large German
companies. Those relationships are expressed via direct industrial holdings
and via influential positions occupied by bankers on industrial companies'
supervisory boards. For example, besides Daimler-Benz, Deutsche is reputed
to have stakes of at least 10 per cent in more than 80 large German
companies. And the chief executive of Deutsche is traditionally chairman of
the Daimler supervisory board. Such relationships lead to a flow of
information between banks and companies from which ordinary shareholders are
excluded.
'It is the most Japanese system outside Japan,' says Roland Berger, head of
the leading German managing consultancy that bears his name. 'The German
corporate governance system is part of the country's consensus society. It
is a system of controlled behaviour where people don't do unconventional
things.
'It ensures that radical and short-term-oriented decisions and moves cannot
be expected from German management and supervisory boards. Companies are
much more long-term.'
But has the stock market's lack of pressure on management deepened the
impact of Germany's recession? Critics such as Prof Wenger argue that the
security and cosiness of the German system blinded companies to signs of
impending recession last autumn, with the result that wage rises were too
high.
While not so extreme as Wenger, Berger concedes that the German system
'means that the factor capital is not employed in the most rational way. . .
managers are not under enough pressure to make their assets sweat. The
interests of shareholders have a lower priority than issues such as the
development of long-term technology, labour relations, consumer
responsibility and so forth'.
Others strongly disagree, citing the long-termism that the system encourages
as a central reason for the success of the German economy in the decades
since the end of the second world war.
Walter Seipp, chairman of the supervisory board of Commerzbank, believes
German managers' freedom from the threat of takeovers is a strength.
'It has been argued that takeovers have helped strengthen corporate US,' he
says. 'On the contrary. There are many companies which have been decisively
weakened by successive leveraged takeovers and by the need to fight off
unwelcome bids. I am very happy that we have not had this wave of takeovers
in Germany.'
Seipp accepts that many German companies are in need of a degree of
'cultural revolution'. But he rejects suggestions that the absence of a
'market for corporate control' has weakened boardrooms. 'I don't know any
other European country which is so open in terms of chances to get to the
top of management. Neither family nor school nor university have any
influence on this. Getting into the corporate elite is based on performance
and nothing else.
'I fear that those who talk about shareholder value are those who simply
want to make a fast buck.'
Whether that remark is justified or not, there is certainly reason to doubt
whether the current corporate governance debate poses a serious threat to
the system.
There is little chance that a wave of takeovers will force German companies
to restructure. Research from two UK academics shows that 86 per cent of all
listed German companies have a single shareholder of 25 per cent or more,
providing an effective block to takeovers**.
Moreover, recent economic evidence suggests the worst of the German
recession may be past. The stock market has reached new highs amid optimism
that companies and unions have agreed on the cost-cutting measures to
restore the competitiveness of German industry, without the threat of
takeovers. If the economy does restore its former economic might the
questioning about the efficacy of the German system will fade away.

FT  06 AUG 93 / The Property Market: Continental comeback - Interest rate
cuts could relieve pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could the turmoil in Europe's currency markets mark a turning point for
Europe's stricken property industry? Optimists believe that, if the upheaval
results in interest rate cuts, it could relieve some of the pressure on
Continental property markets.
Some relief is certainly needed. In the three months to June, average
capital values fell by more than 3 per cent; in the year to June, values
fell by 18 per cent, according to a survey of Europe's 13 largest property
markets by Richard Ellis, the chartered surveyors.
It is tempting to draw parallels with the UK market following sterling's
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism last September, when the fall in
sterling and the reduction of interest rates paved the way for a change in
sentiment towards commercial property.
It raised the prospect of a revival in tenant demand; it relieved the
pressure on property company balance sheets; and it encouraged investors to
switch out of bank deposits into higher-yielding property.
The comparison with the UK should not be taken too far, however. For one
thing, most countries in Continental Europe appear to be unwilling to make
sweeping cuts in interest rates and the value of their currency. For
another, lower interest rates would have less impact on property companies
on the Continent, where there is a greater use of fixed-rate finance for
property.
Nonetheless, there is little doubt that high real interest rates have
damaged Europe's property markets. Across Europe, vacancy rates are
continuing to rise, albeit from a low base, in most Continental cities.
Development activity is very limited. Investors are generally wary, although
they are beginning to return to some markets such as London.
In general, investment yields are relatively stable, but rents are falling
sharply. But the performances of individual markets vary significantly:
The Belgian property market has, until recently, performed strongly. But
recently a downturn in demand from tenants has pushed vacancy rates up to an
average of 6.5 per cent, according to Richard Ellis. Rents have fallen by
about 5 per cent to BFr8,750 per sq m a year. However demand from investors
has held up, which has pushed investment yields down slightly to about 7.5
per cent.
The French property market demonstrates some similarities with that of the
UK, with a serious oversupply problem in Paris of rental property, along
with high levels of bank borrowings and bad property debts. Prime yields
have risen from less than 4 per cent to 6 per cent, according to Richard
Ellis. Rents, which stand at about FFr3,600 per sq m a year, are still
falling.
Germany's deepening recession has sent rents down across the country, with
the exception of Dusseldorf, according to Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered
surveyors. Investment yields for prime property have, however, remained
steady as investors, faced with declining interest rates, have redirected
funds into property.
Italy's political and economic crises have depressed the property market
even though interest rates, at 9 per cent, are at their lowest since 1976.
Occupier demand in the office market is low and rents are about 20 per cent
below their peak.
The Netherlands' property market is relatively stable. Despite declining
economic growth and a slight drop in letting activity, rents have held up
well and there have even been modest increases in Rotterdam and Utrecht,
according to Jones Lang Wootton. Investment interest, particularly from
foreign investors, has increased.
It is unclear whether the Dutch stand to gain or lose from the crisis in the
ERM. While it may try to lower interest rates, the guilder's continued link
to the D-Mark in the old 2.5 per cent band may put exporters at a
disadvantage.
The Spanish property market is declining rapidly. Rents are falling sharply.
They have dropped by 13 per cent to Pta3,500 per sq m a month in Madrid and
by 14 per cent to Pta3000 per sq m a month in Barcelona, according to
Richard Ellis. Central Madrid has a vacancy rate of 6 per cent, while on the
outskirts the vacancy rates rise to as much as 36 per cent, according to
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley Espana, property advisers.
In Portugal, rents have fallen by 12 per cent in the past three months to a
maximum of Es5,700 per sq m a year, according to Richard Ellis.
Prime yields in Lisbon have risen to about 10 per cent.
In Ireland, commercial property rents are still stagnant. But falling
interest rates in recent months are encouraging private investors back into
the market, even though institutions remain net sellers. The UK is still
working off the ill effects of the surge in credit and development at the
end of the 1980s. However, there is increasing evidence that the market has
turned the corner.
The combination of a fall in yields and the slower rate of decline in rental
values has started a revival in capital values, which rose by an average of
0.5 per cent in June, according to the Investment Property Databank.
In some respects, the fundamental problems faced by the Continental property
markets are less severe than in the UK or the US. Stricter development
controls and less bank lending have limited the extent of surplus property
in most countries.
Over the next four years, average rental growth will remain below inflation
in Europe's top 30 cities, assuming real growth in GDP of 1 per cent,
according to a forecasting model devised by Hillier Parker, chartered
surveyors.
Unless the crisis in the ERM results in a far-reaching change in economic
policies across the Continent, the prospects of a swift recovery in property
markets are poor.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Management: The lessons of experience - Christopher Lorenz
explains how companies gain from self-analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before Boeing started to develop its 757 and 767 aircraft, a group of senior
employees spent three years on 'Project Homework', comparing the managerial
failures and successes of past development processes. They produced hundreds
of recommendations. Several members of the team then transferred to the 757
and 767 start-up projects.
Guided by this experience, Boeing produced the most problem-free product
launches in its history.
Such systematic self-analysis of a company's experience - especially its
mistakes - is unusual in industry. But it is one of several essential
building blocks for any company which wants to become a learning
organisation, according to David Garvin, a professor at the Harvard Business
School.
Garvin's advice is delivered, in a long article in the latest Harvard
Business Review*, at a time when the learning organisation has become one of
the most popular concepts in management on both sides of the Atlantic. But
the Harvard professor certainly has plenty of practical advice on what he
calls the 'three Ms' of learning organisations.
Meaning. Other authors differ widely over the definition of a learning
organisation - for instance over whether behavioural change is required for
learning to occur. Garvin defines it as one that is 'skilled at creating,
acquiring and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behaviour to
reflect new knowledge and insights'.
Management. His operational guidelines for practice praise Xerox for its
systematic problem-solving; US General Electric, General Foods, Chaparral
Steel and Allegheny Ludlum for various experimental methods; IBM (in the
1960s), Boeing, BP, and the Arthur D. Little consultancy for learning from
experience; Digital, AT&amp;T and Xerox (with benchmarking) for learning from
others; and GTE, Time Life and the PPG Glass Company for transferring
knowledge throughout their organisations through the rotation of personnel
and other means.
Measurement. Ways of assessing an organisation's rate and level of learning
to ensure that gains have been made. Well-known techniques such as learning
curves and experience curves, which relate learning to a company's or
industry's rising production volume, are incomplete, Garvin points out. They
focus on only a single measure of output, cost or price. They ignore
learning that affects other competitive variables, such as quality, delivery
or new product introductions. They ignore possible 'drivers' of learning,
such as new technology or the challenge posed by competing products. And
they say little about the sources of learning or levers of change.
Instead, Garvin advocates use of the half-life curve, a measure originally
developed by Analog Devices, a US semiconductor manufacturer. This measures
the time taken to achieve a 50 per cent improvement in any specified
performance measure, for instance defect rates, on-time delivery or
time-to-market.
Garvin also advises companies to use a range of auditing techniques to track
progress through three overlapping phases: cognitive learning (the expansion
of knowledge and new patterns of thought); behaviour change; and performance
improvement.
For all this to work, companies should start by providing more time and
skills for employees to reflect, analyse and innovate; by breaking down
internal boundaries and external ones; and by creating 'learning forums' on
specific topics, from the changing competitive environment to the health of
cross-functional processes.
For many companies, Garvin's list of tips may prove quite a mouthful. But,
as his examples of best practice show, they are worth digesting.

A high-tech version of the old 'jam jar and sugar' trap promises to bring a
wasp-free summer to gardeners and those who like to eat outdoors.
Distributed by Catchensure, of London, and sold through garden centres, the
Waspy is a cone-shaped clear plastic container comprising a tray and a lid.
The tray is filled with a sweet liquid or jam; the lid raised slightly; and
the wasps follow their noses and climb through the small gap into the cone.
But as they try to escape, by flying towards the light, they hit the rigid

The technology to project the information from a car instrument panel on to
the windscreen has long been mooted. The Weizmann Institute of Science, in
Rehovot, Israel, has developed a holographic technique which could some day
deliver the goods.
This twin hologram system exploits ordinary light - no laser is needed  -
and the optics are just a few millimetres thick, unlike conventional bulky
lenses.
The new system, which is being exploited by Yeda Research and Development,
consists of two holograms coated upon glass. One receives light signals of
an image and diffracts them at an angle. The second projects this image on
to the desired spot. Yeda: Israel, 8 46 35 10.

The would-be Spielberg watches the recording on the television and uses a
simulated version of the camcorder controls, which appear as a picture on

FT  06 AUG 93 / Technology: A new breed looms large - Waterjet weaving is
bringing greater speed and efficiency to the textile industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new breed of weaving machine is sweeping the world of synthetic textiles
manufacturing. It runs at four times the speed of a traditional power loom,
reduces vibration and power consumption and increases safety and
reliability.
The waterjet loom, a combination of precision engineering and a great deal
of water, is helping textile industries in developed countries keep ahead of
low labour cost rivals which still use older technologies.
What waterjet loom designers have done is to abandon the device that dragged
weaving from craft to industry at the start of the industrial revolution.
In 1733, as generations of British schoolchildren learn, John Kay invented
the flying shuttle. Its principle is simple. To make cloth, a weaver pulls a
horizontal yarn (the weft) across vertical yarns (the warp). Kay's invention
was to wind the weft around a bobbin, the shuttle, and fire it like a
slingshot to and fro across the warp. Many of the improvements in weaving
technology since Kay's day have been in finding better ways of powering the
bobbin across the warp.
But the flying shuttle is based on the inelegant principle of accelerating
and decelerating a mass of up to 400g when all that is really needed is to
move the much lighter yarn.
It is also ugly in practice: shuttle looms have to be built like tanks to
cope with the stresses of firing a weight a metre or more across the weft
and stopping it a fraction of a second later. The noise made by a shuttle
loom and the energy that can be released if it breaks down also make it a
health hazard.
The idea of a shuttleless loom has been in the minds of engineers for almost
a century. In the early days, they experimented with, among other things,
commercial vacuum cleaners to try to push the yarn across the warp with a
jet of air.
An airjet loom was patented as early as 1914 and modern versions are now
widely used, especially for weaving natural fibres.
But air jet looms move the yarn at only one-tenth of the speed of the puff
of air that pushes it. This limits the speed of the loom and the width of
the cloth that can be made.
Nor are they good at weaving wet or synthetic fibres, which are denser than
natural fibres and resist the push of air.
The solution is to use a jet of water instead of air. Today's waterjet looms
are much more efficient than their airjet rivals. The yarn picks up most of
the energy in the water and moves at about three-quarters of the speed of
the jet of water. They can also be used with wet yarn, sometimes important
if the yarn has just been chemically treated. Computer control and precision
engineering allow the weft to shoot across the warp at more than 10 times a
second.
Such unequivocal improvements have, not surprisingly, led to a sales boom
for the Japanese companies that developed the technology. Global sales of
waterjet looms rose by 135 per cent between 1988 and 1992, overtaking both
airjet and conventional shuttle looms, according to the International
Textile Manufacturers Federation. Sales of waterjet looms now account for 30
per cent of the world market.
Asia is the biggest market, buying almost 95 per cent of production. This is
partly because of relatively heavy capital investment in textiles generally
in the region and because consumers in the US prefer natural fibre fabrics,
which can be made by airjet looms. Sales in Europe are growing as consumers
learn to like the latest synthetic fabrics such as microfibres, which use
filaments as fine as silk.
Japanese manufacturer Tsudakoma dominates the market. Brisk sales of
waterjet looms last year allowed the company to increase profits at a time
when many companies saw profits fall. Other suppliers are the textiles arm
of motor manufacturer Nissan and Zbrojovka of the Czech Republic, which also
manufactures machine guns.
The technology has its drawbacks. When Toray, Japan's biggest textiles
manufacturer, was looking for a site for its just-opened UK plant, it needed
huge amounts of water to supply a mill of 265 waterjet looms. It chose
Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, partly because it could obtain a contract with
the National Rivers Authority to allow it to draw more than 1m tonnes of
water a year through four boreholes beneath the Pounds 50m factory.
For Toray, the level of automation that can be achieved with the latest
computer-controlled waterjet looms makes the effort worthwhile. It intends
to run the weaving section of its plant entirely unstaffed and it hopes to
be able to switch off the lights in its weaving mill later this year.
The performance of both airjet and waterjet looms is being improved by
booster nozzles that guide and impel the yarn as it shoots across the warp.
Airjet looms have been singled out in the drive to cut the time taken to
change yarns and patterns. This is because expensive garments with short
production runs and more complicated patterns are more likely to be made
from natural fibre fabrics.
The latest airjet machines from Picanol, a Belgian manufacturer, can be
split in two so that prepared modules set up from a different design can be
slotted quickly into place. Similar machines are made by Lindauer Dornier of
Germany and Sulzer Brothers of Switzerland.
Waterjet looms will not replace all their rivals. While they are best for
rapid manufacture of synthetic fibre cloth, airjet looms and other
shuttleless designs remain the first choice for natural fibres.
Even shuttle looms that Kay might have recognised have a place in weaving
traditional cloth and carpets in short runs for luxury markets. Sales of
shuttle looms now account for less than 10 per cent of the market, although
they still account for the majority of working looms around the world.
Textile manufacturing technology moves slowly and inventions more than two
centuries old are still in widespread use. The waterjet loom shows that
technology still has a powerful role to play in what is often regarded as a
traditional industry fit only for low labour-cost countries.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Technology: A speedy result on exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As students bite their nails waiting for their examination results, due to
be published this month, they might spare a thought for the examiners, who
have to mark the papers and compile the results.
The task could hardly be more difficult than for the International
Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO), the charity that offers a pre-university
curriculum and examination for 16-19-year-olds in nearly 500 schools in 67
countries. The papers are set in up to 80 different languages, from English
and French to Dzongkha, Swahili and Welsh.
The IBO is now turning to the latest technology to ensure that the results
are published as quickly as possible. The sooner the publication, the
greater the chance of students getting a 'second bite of the cherry' if
their first choice college rejects them, points out Andrew Bollington, IT
project manager at the IBO.
The IBO is conducting a trial with an international managed data network
service which should eventually whizz the test results between the
administrative centre in Cardiff, the headquarters in Geneva, the offices in
New York, Singapore and Buenos Aires and the many schools where the
examination is conducted.
At the moment the post from some schools can take six weeks to arrive in
Wales. Communicating with the examiners can also take an inordinate length
of time, Bollington points out.
Once the IBO's plans are fully operational, Bollington envisages data being
sent backwards and forwards between the participating schools and Cardiff in
minutes. The bulk of the schools should be communicating electronically in
two years, he believes.
The network will be used for schools to register the marks for individual
coursework, which is one aspect of the assessment process. Then it will be
used for examiners to send the test results. Cardiff will then send the
final results back to the school.
The IBO has chosen to use BT's managed data network, which means that the
schools need only pay a local call charge to dial into the network - the
IBO's Cardiff office foots the rest of the bill.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Roads bring growing tensions to Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES announced yesterday to cut red tape surrounding new road projects
throw a spotlight on growing tensions between transport and environmental
policies.
The two government departments concerned occupy opposite ends of the same
1970s tower block in Westminster. Environmentalists - and some government
officials in private - wonder whether that is all they share.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said it was 'dismayed' that
road planning would be speeded up. It added: 'The Department of Transport is
in a world of its own. The government as a whole is committed to achieving
more environmentally sustainable transport policies.'
The past few weeks have seen fierce battles between environmental
campaigners and the government's roads programme. Yesterday's announcement
came as six people who protested against the extension of the M3 at Twyford
Down, Hampshire, were released from prison on remission after serving half
their 28-day sentences for defying an injunction. They went straight to the
Department of Transport to continue their protest.
A month ago the government dropped plans to build a highway through the
ancient Oxleas Wood in south-east London, after local and national
opposition of similar intensity. But just two weeks ago it announced that
the M25 motorway encircling the capital would be widened to 14 lanes at its
busiest point.
The Department of the Environment has stayed quiet on most of these
proposals, although Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has welcomed the
Oxleas Wood reprieve. He and Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, say
they work closely with each other.
The UK's Pounds 23bn road building programme poses several problems for
environment policy. Traffic fumes are the fastest growing factor in air
pollution - some doctors hold them responsible for soaring cases of asthma
in children. Carbon dioxide from vehicles also threatens the UK's ability to
meet international environmental targets.
Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, was sceptical that yesterday's
measures would succeed in speeding up road planning.
The environment department has acknowledged that growth in traffic emissions
is one of the most intractable pollution trends. But it said the roads
programme would help reduce traffic jams. It added: 'We've always said that
it is better to have cars moving than waiting idly putting out fumes.' It
said there would be no 'open sprawl' of construction. Planning measures,
such as the 'green belt' around London, were already in place.
It may take more than that ring of foliage, however, to persuade
environmentalists that common ground can be found between the transport and
environment policies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTRA 100,000 jobs would be made available to disabled people if
public-sector employers observed quotas, the Trades Union Congress has told
the government.
Larger employers are supposed to offer 3 per cent of jobs to registered
disabled people. Government departments, apart from the National Health
Service, are exempt but say they aim to meet the quota voluntarily.
The TUC says the government's figures show that the Department of Employment
is the only one to do this, while only 17 local councils meet the quota. No
figures are collected on private-sector employers, but the TUC fears they
'may have an even worse record'.

<TEXT>
TURNOVER in overseas equities hit an all-time high in July, rising Pounds
3bn on the previous month to Pounds 50.7bn, the London Stock Exchange said
yesterday, Norma Cohen writes.
The total for the first seven months of the year was Pounds 302.1bn, with
nearly two-thirds transacted through firm quotes on the exchange's SEAQ
International system. The exchange estimates that 90 per cent of all
cross-border transactions in Europe are through SEAQ International.
The exchange said 'preoccupation with the ERM was evident' as trading in
European securities rose to 71 per cent of all foreign transactions, up from
65 per cent in June. Activity was heavy in French, German and Dutch
equities. Non-European equity turnover fell, particularly in north American
and Japanese stocks.
Trading in domestic equities remained high, boosted by the BT3 flotation of
the government's final stake in the telephone company. Turnover for the
first seven months was Pounds 305.5bn, 40 per cent more than in the same
period last year.

THE Department of Trade and Industry has launched an investigation into the
affairs of Chancery, a banking and financial services group that went into
administration in February 1991 with net liabilities of Pounds 21.9m.
Inspectors have been appointed under Section 432(2) of the Companies Act
1995, which gives them wide-ranging powers to examine documents and question
witnesses. The inspectors are Mr Anthony Robertshaw, Mr Michael Deveson and
Mr Robert Chandler.
The failure of the banking group - which subsequently came out of
administration - was blamed on over-exposure to commercial property, which
accounted for nearly two thirds of its loan book.
Chancery, based in west London, was founded in 1977 as Chancery Securities
by four chartered accountants. It became the first merchant bank to join the
Unlisted Securities Market in 1985.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Cuts in higher NHS management considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS ARE considering radical options for streamlining the higher levels
of National Health Service management.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has received the report of the
Functions and Manpower Review - a committee set up to examine management
structure following the 1991 NHS reforms - and will consider it over the
summer.
The reforms have created an internal market in which hospitals provide
services which district health authorities purchase. Many hospital and
health authority managers believe, however, that the market is inhibited by
excessive bureaucracy in the Department of Health, its management executive
and regional health authorities.
The review committee, chaired by Ms Kate Jenkins, a former head of the
Downing Street efficiency unit and one of the originators of the Next Steps
programme for executive agencies, received evidence from NHS organisations
calling for more devolution to local managers.
It is understood that the committee's report presents a range of options.
This means the government will be left to decide the extent to which it is
prepared to reduce central control over the NHS market.
The issue is one that threatens to divide ministers. Some believe the
politically sensitive nature of health means the government must retain
strong day-to-day influence, while others fear heavy central control will
stifle potential efficiency gains of the internal market.
The BBC yesterday reported that options in the review include abolishing the
14 English regional health authorities.
Mr David Hinchliffe, Labour health spokesman, said reported options 'seem
not to have addressed the core problem with the changes the government has
introduced - lack of accountability and the corruption and mismanagement
that has produced'.
The options considered ranged from making the management executive, which
has daily responsibility for running the NHS, more independent of ministers,
to absorbing it in the Department of Health.
Mrs Bottomley is known to believe that an intermediate tier of management
between Whitehall and the hospitals and districts is needed. At a time of
public spending pressures, however, thinning the management structure could
be a more attractive option than seeking savings from clinical services.
Recent evidence of managerial and financial irregularities in the Wessex and
West Midlands regional health authorities may increase ministers' reluctance
to reduce central control. The Commons health committee is to examine the
NHS drugs budget in the autumn. MPs will consider whether steps to control
the budget are leading to more appropriate and cost-effective use of drugs.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Data protection scope widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS-to-business mailing lists are covered by the Data Protection Act,
the data protection registrar ruled yesterday.
Mailing lists increasingly contained personal data and were vulnerable to
abuse, said Mr Eric Howe, the registrar, who is seeking stronger safeguards
against the 'black market' in personal data.
Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar, said: 'The direct
marketing industry has sometimes felt that the act does not affect
business-to-business lists because they do not contain personal data.'
He said this argument was no longer tenable as business-to-business direct
marketing became more sophisticated and personalised and the volume of
direct mail rose from 251m items in 1980 to 610m last year.
The new guidance is aimed at ensuring that marketing organisations using
business-to-business lists obtain and process personal data 'fairly and
lawfully'. Such lists are compiled by brokers for companies seeking new
customers to target for products.
When personal data on such lists are processed with reference to the person
concerned - rather than the company or job the person holds - the data comes
within the scope of the act, the registrar said.
'For example, John Smith, finance manager of The Widget Production Company,
identifies a particular individual. If that data is then processed so as to
produce information about 'John Smith' rather than 'the finance manager'
then it is processed by reference to the data subject and comes within the
scope of the act.'
This means that the individuals concerned must be told at the time data is
collected who the data user is, what are the uses to which the data may be
put and to whom the data may be disclosed.
Mr David Clark, of Ibis Information Services, a broker which compiles lists,
said the guidance would not constrain Ibis's business because it mostly
processed data 'by reference to some characteristic of the company rather
than the individual'. The company is registered under the Data Protection
Act.

<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International, the collapsed
fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, were in discussion with the authorities
in northern Cyprus yesterday in an apparent attempt to stop the government
taking over the group's local assets and delaying their disposal.
Mr Chris Howells, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, representing the UK
court-appointed administrators to the group, met Mr Salih Cosar, the
territory's finance minister.
Mr Howells had a separate meeting with Mr Mentes Aziz, the lawyer acting for
Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman and former chairman of Polly Peck.
The latest negotiations follow threats to sequestrate the group's principal
businesses on the island - two hotels, the Jasmine Court and the Palm Beach;
and Sunzest, the fruit export operation.
Administrators said yesterday there had not yet been a sequestration order
and said they would oppose any move which 'would take the companies out of
direct control of the shareholders'.
The administrators are today expected to conclude the disposal of ICP, a
pharmaceutical company which Polly Peck owns through a Jersey subsidiary.
However, it was unclear whether any cash would be remitted to the creditors.
The company was earlier taken over by the government because of Polly Peck's
failure to pay some TL50bn (Pounds 2.92m) the government says is owed in tax
and social security dues.
Any disposals will be further complicated by the fact that the hotels in
question are leaseholds which can only be transferred with government
permission.
The administrators were said to be in negotiations with various Turkish and
Turkish Cypriot buyers before Mr Nadir's flight from Britain.
Yesterday officials confirmed that Mr Dervis Eroglu, the prime minister of
north Cyprus, had been contacted by Mr Nadir who was said to have requested
a new timetable to settle debts.

FT  06 AUG 93 / MacGregor strives to cut waiting time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING a new trunk road or bypass takes an average 13 years from the time
of its announcement until the first motorist drives on it.
Reducing that time - at least for priority road projects - is the main
motivation behind the package of measures announced yesterday by the
Department of Transport.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, says that the time can be cut to
10 years, and eventually less.
He also believes that speeding up the process and cutting red tape could
release 'tens of millions of pounds' for building new roads, and lessen the
blight on areas threatened by new roads.
Mr MacGregor is concerned not to be seen as a mad road-builder, riding
roughshod over the objections of people affected by new roads. Most
road-building is in rural areas, and Mr MacGregor is aware of the electoral
dangers to safe Conservative seats in the shires.
So yesterday's announcement was hedged with pledges of support for the
principle of public consultation. 'Everyone whose interests are affected by
new roads should have the opportunity to raise those interests at a public
inquiry,' he said.
In an effort to reconcile these two objectives, the package includes
measures to adopt a less adversarial approach to decision-making on road
schemes. If a broad local consensus could be established about the best
route for a new road at an early stage, then the amount of opposition could
be minimised before the proposals go out to consultation.
New approaches will be tested by calling local conferences on two schemes in
south-west England which have proved difficult to progress.
Mr MacGregor is also proposing changing the rules for public inquiries,
which offer ingenious objectors great scope for prolonging the process. He
was highly critical of delaying tactics of the type used at the Macclesfield
relief road inquiry.
The procedures for planning inquiries are due to be revised to make greater
use of pre-inquiry meetings, encourage the submission of evidence in advance
and eliminate irrelevant or repetitious evidence. Mr MacGregor would like
similar changes for roads inquiries.
More support for inspectors is also suggested: each day of an inquiry
requires two days of work in writing up the report. Often that additional
work must be fitted in between subsequent inquiry hearings, and the
appointment of assistant inspectors could speed up completion of reports.
However, the bulk of the delays lie in the Department of Transport's
internal procedures. According to the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, most of the delay occurs prior to public consultation and after
the inquiry is finished.
That is why a new highways agency and a review of the 500-odd road schemes
to establish priorities are so important in speeding up road-building. The
creation of agencies for other government services has allowed the strategic
parts of government to be separated from the management of individual
projects.
Ministers will make the strategic decisions about road priorities and argue
the case for roads with the Treasury in the annual public expenditure round.
The agency will be responsible for building new trunk roads and motorways on
agreed timetables and budgets. It will also manage and maintain the existing
network with publicly set performance targets.
The Department of Transport will soon be advertising the post of chief
executive of the new agency. The job will be filled by a dynamic individual,
capable of managing more than 2,000 staff on one of the highest profile
public services in the country. The new chief executive's performance
targets are likely to include a substantial reduction in the delays involved
in building new roads.
Whether such a reduction will be greeted with popular acclaim by those in
the path of those new roads remains to be seen.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Tedious timewasting procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is seeking to eliminate 'tedious timewasting procedures' from
the inquiry system, Rachel Johnson writes.
Inspectors are to be given powers to overrule the type of delaying tactics
which turned the Macclesfield relief road inquiry into what Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, described as 'tedious' farce.
The inspector at the Macclesfield inquiry had to spend two days reading out
1,000 individually signed copies of a standard letter of objection, on the
request of the objectors' pressure group.
Inspectors will also be able to deal with objectors failing to appear on a
given day in order to prolong the length of time the hearing is sitting.
Another case that became a bugbear of the Department of Transport was the
six-month M40 extension inquiry. A woman protested that written objections
could not be read out by the department's junior counsel because he would
not use the right inflexions and emphasis.
Inspectors yesterday appeared less concerned than the government about
time-wasting. 'I've been an inspector for 12 years and I've had practically
no experience of mischievous behaviour,' said Sir Michael Giddings.
Others defended the right of objectors to have their say. Major General
Marston Tickell, inspector on the Oxleas Wood inquiry, the longest ever in
the UK, said: 'Not many objectors set out to cause delay. You don't want
them to leave a hearing feeling thwarted.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / DTI investigates banking group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry has launched an investigation into the
affairs of Chancery, a banking and financial services group that went into
administration in February 1991 with net liabilities of Pounds 21.9m.
Inspectors have been appointed under Section 432(2) of the Companies Act
1995, which gives them wide-ranging powers to examine documents and question
witnesses. The inspectors are Mr Anthony Robertshaw, Mr Michael Deveson and
Mr Robert Chandler.
The failure of the banking group, which subsequently came out of
administration, was blamed on over-exposure to commercial property, which
accounted for nearly two thirds of its loan book.
Chancery, based in west London, was founded in 1977 as Chancery Securities
by four chartered accountants. It became the first merchant bank to join the
Unlisted Securities Market in 1985.
Apart from the parent bank, there were 23 subsidiaries, specialising in
factoring, hire purchase instalment credit, stockbroking, business-expansion
scheme sponsorship and other corporate financial services.
In November 1991 Chancery's creditors agreed to a voluntary arrangement to
bring it out of administration. The restructuring plan involved rescheduling
of Pounds 90m of debts over five years and the conversion of the remaining
Pounds 40m of debt into equity.

The company, one of the biggest producers of business lists, is registered

The Direct Marketing Association said the overall size of the industry was
more than Pounds 7bn in terms of income and trade generated. 'We have never
argued that business lists were not covered by the DPA,' said Mr Colin
Fricker, the legal adviser.
The guidance has been produced after discussions between the registrar's
staff and various representative bodies and direct marketing companies that
use business-to-business lists.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS PART of plans to speed up the road-building programme, a new form of
consultation is to be tried out initially with two schemes, one in Cornwall
and one in Hereford.
The plan is for a 'round-table conference of interested parties' to try to
reach a consensus over the need for and route of the schemes. In both trial
cases the road schemes are the subject of strong environmental objections.
In Cornwall the proposed conference, to be held locally early next year,
will consider plans for a 'missing link' of dual carriageway on the A30 near
Indian Queens, a notorious traffic bottleneck, especially during the holiday
season. The Pounds 18m scheme for 6.3 miles of road would link the Bodmin
bypass with the Indian Queens bypass, on which work started last month. It
is contentious because of the impact on Goss Moor, a national nature
reserve.
Mr MacGregor yesterday said that there was no easy answer to the problem of
the road. He added that if the conference led to an acceptable proposal the
scheme would still be subject to normal statutory procedures.
The conference at Hereford will consider proposals for relieving the city's
traffic congestion in the wake of the rejection of a Department of Transport
scheme proposing an 8.5-mile bypass of the A49 dual carriageway. This ran
into heavy opposition because it would cross river meadows.
After a 12-month public inquiry the inspector rejected that proposal.
Hereford and Worcester County Council said yesterday: 'Conservationists were
ecstatic, but the local business and industrial lobby was, to say the least,
displeased.'
Mr Colin Beardwood, chairman of the county council's strategic planning and
transport committee, said the council would support the idea of a forum.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTCH WHISKY makers yesterday reported a continued decline in UK sales and
renewed their call for an easing of the tax on spirits, Philip Rawstorne
writes.
Industry figures for the year to May showed a 5.5 per cent fall in sales.
The Scotch Whisky Association said the government was taking less money in
spite of the Pounds 7.16 tax on every bottle. 'Treasury receipts from
spirits in 1992-93 were down Pounds 80m - 7 per cent in real terms - and are
already heading for a similar loss this year.'
The association blamed the government's taxation policy for encouraging
other European Community members to raise spirits duties.
Mr James Bruxner, association chairman, said nine EC countries had increased
the tax differential between spirits and other drinks during the past 12
months.
Exports to the EC in the first five months of the year were 2 per cent lower
than in the same period last year.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Shipbuyers win extra credit aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMERS OF shipyards are to get extra financial support under rule changes
announced yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, announced a cut in the level of
security needed to qualify for the home shipbuilding credit guarantee scheme
(HCS). 'New applicants for HCS will now be able to use their new vessels as
security for up to 60 per cent of the loan - rather than the 40 or 50 per
cent that has been the practice in the past,' he said.
'This will produce a more level playing field for UK shipbuilders, helping
them to compete with shipbuilders from around the world.
'We are also committed to speeding up processing of the loans, reducing the
red tape and cost of applications.'
Mr Geoff Dean, technical director of A&amp;P Appledore Shipbuilders in north
Devon, said that the change 'will obviously be of help, especially to
smaller shipowners which sometimes have trouble raising the loans they
need'.
The credit guarantee scheme has two main functions: it guarantees loans
provided to shipowners by commercial banks and pays any difference in
interest if the rate is above 7.5 per cent.
Only merchant ships being built or altered at UK shipyards qualify for
assistance.
The scheme is restricted to individuals or companies in the UK, Isle of Man
or the Channel Islands. A foreign company must register as a UK company to
use the scheme.
At March 31 1992, the total amount guaranteed was Pounds 898m, and interest
subsidy paid in 1992-93 was Pounds 20.9m.
The government said that about 20 yards are in a position to benefit from
the changes. Last year they employed 5,750 people and built 28 vessels worth
Pounds 220m.
The change may help slow the fall in capacity and production seen in recent
years. In 1990, 23 yards employed 8,160 people to make 33 ships that were
worth Pounds 238m. A year later, one yard had closed and production fell to
31 ships worth Pounds 209m.
Some of these ships went to foreign buyers who would not have qualified for
help.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Labour aims to help small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLICY designed to encourage small companies to expand and provide more
jobs will be launched by the Labour party next month.
It reflects the determination of Mr John Smith and the shadow cabinet to
develop an effective strategy for reducing unemployment.
Labour believes the government has not maximised the job opportunities which
can be provided by businesses capable of making the transition from small to
medium size.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Derek Fatchett,
industry spokesman, are to tour the country to establish contacts with
owners and managers of small businesses.
Mr Fatchett said yesterday that a policy document would be published towards
the end of next month. Aimed at companies with potential for growth, it will
include:
Schemes to encourage closer co-operation in sectors or areas to strengthen
small companies' bargaining positions when negotiating credit terms with
banks.
Proposals for helping small companies to make greater use of new technology.
Help for small companies over late payment of bills by getting larger
companies to standardise practice in paying their suppliers.
Mr Fatchett stressed that a Labour government would have no more than a
'pilot' role in seeking to strengthen the creditworthiness of small
companies, with limited financial involvement.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Gummer confirms guidance review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN GUMMER, the environment secretary, has confirmed in a letter to Mr
Jack Straw, his Labour shadow, that the government is re-examining its
guidance to the Local Government Commission.
Mr Gummer's plans to put the review on a voluntary basis by requiring
councils to opt in were vetoed last week by Mr John Major, the prime
minister.
Mr Gummer's letter, however, makes clear that changing the criteria for
reviewing the counties remains a serious option. He said: 'We are
re-examining our guidance to the Local Government Commission. I can assure
you now that there is no question of abandoning the review.'
A decision is not expected until September.

THE HARD Ecu represents the only option left for business to gain full
advantage from the single European market, the Institute of Directors said
yesterday. It said that, with the timetable for a single currency
'inevitably delayed', the early introduction of a common currency was of
paramount importance for the European economy.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said the present method envisaged for
creating monetary union was unrealistic and that the hard Ecu 'currently
represents the best alternative route'.

He hit back at Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, over his attack
on the ex-chancellor's handling of events leading up to sterling's
suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Mr
Lamont said: 'I do not accept what Sir Edward Heath says.'
In a letter to The Times Mr Lamont accused Sir Edward of 'oddly' muddling
his views up with those of Mr John Major, the prime minister.

THE CONSERVATIVE party was last night confronted with an opinion poll
putting its popularity rating at its lowest level ever, David Owen writes.
The survey, conducted by Gallup and published by The Daily Telegraph, showed
the Tories in third place on 23 per cent, a drop of 1.5 percentage points
from July.
Labour leads with 44.5 per cent, up 1.5 points, while the Liberal Democrats
have 27 per cent, up half a point.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, saw his personal rating at below 20 per

FT  06 AUG 93 / Debit card payments gain popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of debit cards to make payments grew strongly last year as they were
substituted for cheques, it was disclosed yesterday. Debit card transactions
rose by 45 per cent to 522m, compared with 360m the previous year.
The Association for Payment Clearing Services said that further transfer
from the use of cheques as well as the substitution of debit cards for cash
and credit card payments could lead to 2.5bn debit payments a year by the
year 2000.
Cheques and paper credits fell for the second year running from its 1990
peak, down 4 per cent to 4.1bn transactions. Transactions are expected to
fall a further 3 per cent a year this decade.
The figures indicate the growth in card payments, which are favoured by
banks because they reduce expensive cash and paper clearing. The total cost
of the clearing system has been estimated by the association at Pounds 4.5bn
a year.
However, cash remains dominant with 66 per cent of payments of more than
Pounds 1 in value being made by notes and coins.
Total transactions with plastic cards, including cash withdrawals from
automated teller machines, rose nearly 12 per cent to about 2.5bn. Credit
card payments resumed their growth after a static year in 1991, and rose 3
per cent. The number of cash withdrawals from ATM cash machines rose 7 per
cent, a significant slowing on 30 per cent annual growth rates during the
1980s.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Private company law to be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has suggested changes to company law to
help members of private companies to make resolutions without calling a
general meeting.
Private companies have been able to make resolutions outside a general
meeting as long as written approval has been obtained from all members who
would have been entitled to vote at a general meeting.
But the 1989 Companies Act prescribed that any proposed written resolution
must be sent to the company's auditors. It would only be valid if the
auditors notified the company that they did not see a need for a general
meeting or if seven days elapsed without the auditors replying.
The department is now proposing revoking the 1989 amendment and dispensing
with the requirement to consult auditors.
The department said yesterday: 'It could be argued that this only serves to
introduce unnecessary delay and complexity into the procedures and
discourages companies from making use of them.' It acknowledged that
removing the requirement to notify auditors might be seen as 'reducing the
safeguards available for shareholders'.
Mrs Margaret Chamberlain, of solicitors Travers Smith Braithwaite, a member
of the British Venture Capital Association's legal and technical committee,
said she did not see that shareholders' safeguards would be affected. The
law still required all members to be notified and to approve changes.
She said the 1989 change was meant to simplify matters, but had done the
opposite causing confusion for newly created companies which might have no
auditors.
A less radical proposal from the department is to make clear that companies
without auditors, either dormant or new, are entitled to use the statutory
written procedure.
Written resolutions are not permitted for the removal of directors or
auditors before their period of office ends.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Prison cheese on the Savoy's menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRODS, the Savoy, the Ritz and many other leading London stores, hotels
and restaurants will this week start taking their supplies of mozzarella and
ricotta from the prison service.
In one of the most ambitious commercial ventures ever undertaken by the
prison service in Britain, women prisoners at East Sutton Park Open Prison,
Kent, have been trained in cheesemaking. Each day they will turn 12,000
litres of milk from cows on the prison farm into one tonne of mozzarella and
half a tonne of ricotta.
The scheme brings together a number of features that officials hope will
increasingly shape the future of the prison service - public/private sector
partnerships, market-rate wages for prisoners and training for real jobs
that may help reduce the re-offending rate.
The prison's cheesemaking activities will take place in conjunction with Mr
Edgardo Pasquali, an Italian businessman. The prison service will sell the
cheese to Mr Pasquali whose company, Mama Mia, will distribute and market
it.
Prisoners employed on the scheme will work in a realistic workplace
environment and earn around Pounds 130 per week, compared with an average of
about Pounds 6 in traditional prison workshops. They will pay tax and board
and lodging allowances from their wages, and much of the rest will
accumulate for their release. The women had to submit written applications
to join the project, and were selected by interview.
Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, who launched the
scheme at East Sutton Park yesterday, said prison could be very
debilitating, taking away people's sense of responsibility. The new
enterprise should enable prisoners to regain that responsibility for their
own lives, and help them to live in a law-abiding way after their release.
He said the venture showed the value of partnership with the private sector.
The prison service would not have had the marketing, distribution or
technical skills to launch it alone.
Mr Pasquali said he believed the quality of farming conditions at East
Sutton Park would enable the prison to produce some of the best mozzarella
and ricotta in Europe. Only high-quality outlets, including 250 leading
London restaurants, would be supplied.
The prison service owns 5,800 hectares of land - 60 per cent of it in use as
farms and gardens. Most of the produce and milk is used to supply prison
kitchens.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Vauxhall leads improvement in new-car market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF new cars in the UK rose 7 per cent last month as Vauxhall gained
market leadership in a single month for the first time.
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, won 23.2 per cent of sales of
new cars last month compared with the 20.3 per cent achieved by Ford, the
traditional market leader.
In spite of its higher UK sales Vauxhall is being forced to continue
short-time working at its two UK assembly plants because of the decline in
demand in continental Europe. The company said last night that workers at
Luton, Bedfordshire, and Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, are also to be given an
extra week's holiday because of the poor export demand.
Vauxhall's leadership of the UK market is likely to be short-lived - July is
the smallest sales month, as many buyers delay their purchases until August
to gain the benefit of the new registration letter.
Registrations of new cars in July rose to 35,376 from 33,051 in the same
month a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said
yesterday. Sales of new cars have recorded year-on-year increases in 13 of
the past 16 months. Registrations in the first seven months of the year rose
by 9.1 per cent to 874,411.
The UK is virtually the only car market in western Europe where sales are
growing, albeit from a depressed level. Sales of new commercial vehicles,
however, fell last month by 10.8 per cent year-on-year.
Forecasts for new-car sales in August suggest an increase of 8 per cent to
10 per cent to about 410,000 from the 373,804 achieved last August.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation predicts that sales of new cars will
rise to 1.73m in the full year from 1.59m in 1992, a rise of 8.8 per cent.
In the first seven months of the year Ford gained 21.7 per cent of the
new-car market compared with the 17.3 per cent held by Vauxhall.
Ford's market share has been eroded in recent years.
Vauxhall's share has risen from 13.5 per cent in 1987 to a record 16.7 per
cent last year. It has been helped this year by the launch of its Corsa
range. Last month the Vauxhall Astra and Corsa were the two top-selling cars
in the UK.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Daf offshoot sold in Pounds 50m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTIPART, the spare-parts business of the failed Leyland Daf group, has
been acquired from the receivers by a management buy-in team in a deal worth
'in excess of Pounds 50m', according to Mr Alan Simpson, former managing
director of Land Rover Parts and leader of the acquisition team.
The management team is being backed by Pounds 17.3m in equity capital
provided by Phildrew Ventures, the UK venture capital arm of Union Bank of
Switzerland. National Westminster Bank is providing a long-term loan of
Pounds 20m.
The deal is the final significant step in the rescue of the various parts of
the former Daf group in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium, which went into
receivership at the beginning of February.
It is understood that the joint administrative receivers in the UK, Mr
Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the accountancy
firm, expect to raise more than Pounds 120m when the disposal of the
different parts of the failed Leyland Daf is completed.
The parts business, based in Chorley, Lancashire, had a turnover last year
of about Pounds 140m and has a workforce of 331.
The venture led by Mr Simpson beat a bid from a management buy-out team at
Chorley as well as strong interest from Unipart, the vehicle-parts
distributor and engineering group.
The management buy-in team includes Mr Les Wharton, a former managing
director of Austin Rover and Leyland Trucks, who will become non-executive
chairman, and Mr David Benson, a former managing director of Leyland Parts,
who will become a non-executive director.
Multipart has long-term supply contracts with all three manufacturing
companies that have been salvaged from the failed Daf group - Leyland Daf
Vans in Birmingham; Leyland Trucks Manufacturing in Leyland, Lancashire; and
Daf Trucks in the Netherlands - all of which are separately owned.
Mr McKillop said yesterday that the receivers were in negotiations which
could lead to the sale next month of the two Leyland Daf components
manufacturing businesses, the Albion axle plant in Glasgow and the
components plant in Leyland.
The other remaining parts of the former Leyland Daf group in receivership
are a test track and technical centre at Leyland, and an engine and gearbox
refurbishing plant at St Helens, Lancashire.
The Leyland van and truck assembly plants have been acquired by separate
management buy-out teams, while the Leyland Daf truck sales and marketing
arm was taken over by Daf Trucks of the Netherlands.
To date about 2,160 jobs have been saved from the former Leyland Daf's
workforce, which stood at 5,500 when the company collapsed.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Ship survey and certification work to be contracted out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 25 per cent of the ship survey and certification work undertaken by
the Surveyor General's Organisation of the Department of Transport is to be
contracted out to the private sector, John Willman writes.
The move was announced yesterday by Lord Caithness, minister for shipping.
The organisation regulates the safety and pollution prevention requirements
for ships and their equipment.
Consultation with the shipping industry revealed considerable resistance to
more contracting out. Critics believed such a move might detract from the
independent role of the organisation and jeopardise marine safety.
The organisation will retain direct involvement in survey and certification
of passenger certificates. It will also remain involved in all surveys of
items directly related to safety of passengers and crew.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Civil engineers urge action as work hopes slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERATION of Civil Engineering Contractors yesterday called for a
further reduction in interest rates after a fresh downturn in members'
expectations for new work and manual employment over the next 12 months.
The federation's quarterly survey of workload trends found a further slight
decline in work and jobs since April, and a renewed weakening of order
books. It comes amid a week of generally gloomy forecasts of the outlook for
the construction industry.
Mr John Hackett, federation director-general, said: 'This disappointing
fresh downturn in our members' confidence in the future is clearly linked to
growing uncertainties over demand for their services in several key areas.'
He said contractors, and especially larger companies, were still frustrated
by the lack of a firm start date for work on the Jubilee Line extension to
London's Underground.
Speaking on the day that the government announced plans to speed up the road
building process, Mr Hackett said contractors were worried by the slow pace
at which the Department of Transport was awarding new motorway and trunk
road contracts.
He said there was a growing number of reports of reduced civil engineering
works by some water companies, pending decisions by the industry regulator
on their future prices and investment plans.
Mr Hackett said changes in control at English county councils following the
elections in May had been followed in some areas by hints of lower spending
on local roads.
He added that members were worried by government proposals to exempt local
authorities undergoing reorganisation from obligations to expose work to
competition from private contractors. There were particular fears in Wales,
where all councils will be reorganised at the same time.
'What's needed now, to boost confidence, is confirmation of the government's
spending plans for roads and other basic infrastructure, early announcements
of firm start dates for key projects and, not least, some further reduction
in interest rates to help private-sector demand,' said Mr Hackett.

<TEXT>
THE Cabinet Office is to launch a monthly publication in the autumn to
publicise details of Civil Service work being put out to tender as part of
the market-testing programme, John Willman writes.
The Contracts Bulletin will provide information about contracts to supply
services to government departments and agencies. It will also offer an
opportunity to advertise services to government purchasing managers.
The contract for producing the bulletin was itself put out to tender. It was
won by Business Information Publications, a Glasgow company which publishes
Contrax Weekly, which advertises public-sector contracts.
The cost of the bulletin will be met by the Pounds 120-a-year subscription,
with no expense to the taxpayer, the Cabinet Office said.

<TEXT>
In another sign of a thaw between the US and Vietnam, Hanoi announced
yesterday that a US congressional delegation would study investment and
trade prospects in Vietnam next week, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
The 12-member team from the House of Representatives' ways and means
committee will be one of the first congressional economic missions to
Vietnam, with which the US has no diplomatic relations. The visit from
August 12 to 15 comes a month before US President Bill Clinton must decide
whether to lift the US economic embargo against Hanoi dating from 1964.
The aim of the mission is 'to study Vietnam's renovation policy and economic
development and business and investment opportunities in Vietnam,' Ms Ho The
Lan, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said.
Mr Clinton is under pressure from conflicting pressure groups as the
September 14 deadline approaches for him to renew or scrap the embargo.
War veteran groups want him to maintain the sanctions, but US companies want
them ended so that they can compete for contracts to be awarded as a result
of his move a month ago to lift a US ban on new multilateral lending to
Vietnam.
Ms Lan also announced that Vietnam had accepted a US proposal to station
three diplomats in Hanoi - the first to be posted to Vietnam since 1955,
when the US mission closed following Vietnam's 1954 defeat of French forces
at Dien Bien Phu.
Their official job will be consular, but western diplomats say they will
amount to a US liaison office with Vietnam.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Japan's LDP wins stay on losing power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party won a stay of execution yesterday through
skilled haggling over the procedural technicalities of a parliamentary
session that is to select a new prime minister and install a cabinet.
Much of the day was spent 'discussing how to discuss our disputes', one LDP
deputy explained. Japan ended the day with a prime minister, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, but without a cabinet, which formally resigned in expectation of a
stint in opposition.
For the first time since 1955, the LDP is on the verge of losing power, as
it is outnumbered 228 to 260 in the lower house by the seven-party
coalition.
The parties range from the left-leaning Social Democratic party through
several conservative parties to the Komeito, or Clean Government party,
which is Japan's version of the religious right.
In Kumamoto, the home town of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the coalition's prime
minister designate, revellers waiting to light ceremonial lanterns were left
with nothing to celebrate, as MPs from the government and opposition met
eight times without a settlement.
The LDP found fault with the coalition's choice of lower house speaker and
the planned length of the parliamentary session, and demanded that Mr
Hosokawa make a policy speech after his election to prime minister.
The haggling will begin again today and could last until early next week.
The LDP demanded the right to appoint a speaker as it is still the largest
single party, but the coalition wants Ms Takako Doi, the former Social
Democratic party leader, who would be the first woman to hold the post.
The LDP's other complaint had less merit, as the party itself had set the
original schedule for the parliamentary session, due to last until the end
of next week.
The request for Mr Hosokawa to explain his administration's policies is an
attempt to have him trip over the party lines of one or other of the
coalition members. Machine tool orders in Japan were down by more than a
quarter in the first half of the year and orders for the whole year may be
the lowest for a decade as domestic manufacturers continue to cut capital
spending, writes Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
The Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association said yesterday that orders for
the six months to June were Y287.3bn (Pounds 1.82bn), down 25.6 per cent.
Export orders were down only 8.6 per cent from the same period of 1992 but
those placed by customers at home fell 33.2 per cent.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Farmers reap the gains of land laws: The market reforms
transforming Vietnamese agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM'S programme of economic reforms is having a big effect on the lives
of the country's 55m peasant farmers. With increasing rights over the land
they farm, they are now free to make commercial decisions, but a growing
number are finding that market reform means lower incomes.
A new land law passed by the National Assembly on the final day of its
latest session last month allows private ownership of land in all but name.
Under the law, peasants can lease, mortgage, inherit and 'transfer' (a more
acceptable term than 'sell') the land they farm.
The Assembly also passed a law cutting agricultural taxes from 10 to 5 per
cent, giving farmers a greater incentive to increase their output.
According to the country's 1992 constitution, all land officially belongs to
the people - in other words, to the state. Under the new land law, however,
farmers will be guaranteed the use of their land for between 20 and 50
years.
The law is a logical step in a process that started in 1989 when Vietnam
officially abandoned its policy of collectivisation of land.
The programme had been pursued in north Vietnam since 1954, when the country
gained its independence from French rule. However, the Communist party's
attempt to introduce the same policy in southern Vietnam after reunifying
the country in 1975 met fierce resistance and was quietly abandoned.
The government hopes the new laws providing security of tenure and lower
taxes will encourage the country's farmers to invest in the land and to
become less dependent on state investment in the sector.
With the growth of a free- market economy in Vietnam, farmers are finding
that their traditional three rice crops a year are earning less and less.
Vietnam is one of the largest exporters of rice in the world and the price
at home has dropped sharply.
Vietnam derives nearly half of its income from agriculture, which is
dominated by rice.
Farming accounts for nearly three-quarters of the country's employment, and
about a third of its exports.
Many farmers say they want to diversify and grow at least one cash crop a
year. The problem is that Vietnam's banking system has not adapted quickly
to the new economic system. Credit is scarce and farmers who have no gold
hidden under the floor are finding it hard to raise the money to modernise.
The new land law appears to be popular with farmers. One man working in the
rice fields rice just outside Hanoi says that he and his family have been
farming the same land for nearly 30 years but, with the land collectivised,
he has enjoyed little personal reward for his efforts. Now, he observes with
a grin, he will be able to increase his yield and keep the proceeds.
Ideologically, private ownership of land is very hard for the ruling
Communist party to accept. It goes against the basic tenets of their
philosophy: Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh Thought. One delegate to the
National Assembly said that the land law and the lower agricultural tax were
designed to promote the Vietnamese concept of 'market reform with socialist
characteristics'.
As a compromise, the new law allows almost total freedom in the use and
transfer of land, which will have the same effect but will cause fewer
problems to the hard-working theorists at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
There has been some debate in the National Assembly over the details of the
law, including what should happen to land when the lease expires. However,
the direction of policy and the contents of new laws are decided at a plenum
of the party's Central Committee before the National Assembly opens and
there was general agreement on the basic principles of the law.
Although land ownership is difficult for the party to swallow, there seems
to be a general acceptance that it is an essential part of Vietnam's market
reforms.
As one party official put it, 'There's no way for Vietnam but to continue
with reform and to improve the general efficiency of the economy.'

CIVILIANS will 'dominate' an interim Nigerian government under a proposal
agreed in Abuja yesterday designed to break the country's political
deadlock.
A joint committee of leaders of Nigeria's two political parties and members
of the military government ended their two-day meeting with a recommendation
that President Ibrahim Babangida hand over to a civilian-led interim
government on August 27.
'It is. . . envisaged that a majority of civilians over military personnel
will dominate the interim national government, including its highest ruling
body,' Vice-President Augustus Aikhomu, head of the committee, said in
handing over its report to General Babangida.
The recommendation is not binding, however, and the precise role of Gen
Babangida in such a government remains unclear. Although many Nigerians are
sceptical about his willingness to step down, he may be under pressure from
within the military.
Although there is considerable popular support for Chief Mashood Abiola, who
continues to demand that his June 12 presidential election victory be
recognised, many of the politicians attending the Abuja meeting feel they
may have to accept the proposed interim civilian government.
Mr Abiola, who has denounced the proposed interim government, met Baroness
Chalker, Britain's overseas development minister, in London yesterday. The
minister restated Britain's call for President Babangida to keep his
commitment to hand over power on August 27.
Mr Abiola later left London for the US, saying his talks there would include
members of the administration.

PRESIDENT F W de Klerk of South Africa and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC
leader, failed to agree on ways to end the violence that has swept townships
east of Johannesburg, in a four-hour crisis meeting yesterday.
Government and African National Congress sources at the meeting said they
reached no agreement on the causes of the violence or the best way to end
it. Police Captain Wikus Weber said the death toll in six days of battles in
townships had risen to 137.
The meeting followed an announcement by Mr Mandela that arrangements were
being made for a joint tour of the East Rand townships by the ANC leader and
Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. It
also came after the deployment of an extra 2,000 policemen, backed by the
Defence Force, in an effort to restore peace.
Before meeting Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela had toured Katlehong, the township at
the heart of the violence, where he struggled to convey a message of peace
and reconciliation to angry supporters.
Addressing a crowd of about 8,000, Mr Mandela said: 'We are building a
nation. The answer has to be reconciliation, peace and political tolerance.'
His call was met, however, with repeated cries for weapons and the presence
of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's military wing.
Mr Mandela also accused the police and security forces of not caring about
black lives. 'To this government, to this police force, to the South African
Defence Force, the lives of black people are cheap. It is as if flies had
died.'
Mr Mandela apportioned some blame to the ANC, admitting that ANC supporters
had been involved in the violence. He said the violence was not only the
responsibility of the government. 'Real leaders do not just point fingers.'
This point is likely to be strongly argued by Mr de Klerk, who is also
likely to stress that a considerable onus rests on Mr Mandela and on Chief
Buthelezi to end the violence.

A huge blast likened by local residents to an atomic explosion has killed up
to 70 people and injured many others in the southern Chinese economic zone
of Shenzhen, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
Xinhua, China's official news agency, reported that a succession of
explosions had rocked Shenzhen city early yesterday afternoon.
Sources in Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong, said the heat from an
initial explosion in a nitric acid storage facility ignited a second, larger
detonation in a gas storage plant nearby. Some 200 people are reported to
have been admitted to hospital.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Testing time for Pakistan's caretaker PM: Qureshi's dash to
tackle chronic economic woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Moeen Qureshi, Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, has only a short time
to tackle the country's chronic economic problems. But he has begun a
campaign to enforce tighter control on spending and to increase revenue
which may, business and economists believe, have long-term impact.
Mr Qureshi, appointed in July to lead a government which is due to hold
office until elections on October 6, said this week: 'The problems (of the
economy) have to do with the establishment of discipline and integrity, not
only in all parts of the public sector but also the private sector. There
has to be a sense of civic commitment to meeting your obligations and I am
afraid that is frequently lacking in Pakistan.'
The former World Bank official is perhaps uniquely qualified to deal with
the problems left behind by Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister who
resigned in July after a bitter political struggle which also resulted in
the premature departure of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
Mr Qureshi, who is 63, worked for Washington financial institutions for 33
years and is therefore untainted by ties to Pakistani political parties.
Deputy chief of the government's planning board while in his 20s, he left
Pakistan in 1958 to join the International Monetary Fund.
He gathered huge experience in the problems of developing countries first as
an African expert at the IMF, and later as a senior official in the
International Finance Corporation. From 1981 until his retirement in 1991,
Mr Qureshi was a senior vice president of the World Bank.
He has inherited an economic situation which worries Pakistan's financial
community, although there have been no official intimations of an immediate
crisis.
Foreign exchange reserves are very low, though bankers believe they have
risen since Mr Qureshi's appointment. Pakistan's trade deficit in the
financial year ended June 30 was Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.14bn), with exports
of Dollars 6.8bn falling short of the targetted Dollars 8bn. Economic growth
slowed and inflation rose in the financial year, and the Asian Development
Bank estimates that foreign debt rose from Dollars 25.4bn to Dollars 28bn.
The latest devaluation was intended to counter Indian and Chinese exports of
textiles, Pakistan's chief export earner. Falling textile sales have led to
widespread losses, with almost 15 per cent of approximately 6m spinning
units shutting down during the past year.
Mr Sharif was an enthusiastic reformer of the economy. He oversaw a
substantial privatisation programme, removed restrictions on industry, and
actively sought to boost exports foreign investment. However, he failed to
curb the budget deficit. Though exports grew, they fell below official
projections. Foreign investment remained small because of economic and
political uncertainties.
Mr Babar Ali, an industrialist who has been appointed finance minister,
says: 'We feel that perhaps there was some hesitation on the part of the
politicians, because there could have been bitter pills that they didn't
want to take, but we have no such hang-ups.'
The interim government's first measure was a 9 per cent devaluation of the
rupee to boost exports. Measures under consideration include reduced
spending on infrastructure, such as motorway construction projects which
began under Mr Sharif, senior officials say.
Mr Qureshi said the steps considered were aimed at reducing the budget
deficit, strengthening the financial position of utility companies such as
the Water And Power Development Authority - Pakistan's largest public sector
supplier of power - and further deregulation of the economy.
He did not make clear whether an increase in the tariff for electricity or
other utilities would be on the agenda. It was also not clear how the
government would deal with the chronic problem of widespread tax evasion.
'People do need to pay taxes. If people don't pay taxes, you cannot have
resources from which to run government,' said Mr Qureshi.
The government has begun an official inquiry intended to compile a list of
bank clients who took large loans, defaulted on repayments and then used
connections to influential politicians to stop the banks from liquidating
their assets. The inquiry began after reports that defaulters could be
barred from contesting the elections.
Some officials see this initiative as an important test of the government's
determination to introduce tough, politically sensitive measures. They hope
Mr Qureshi will leave behind a new medium-term economic plan, which would
help to reduce the overall budgetary deficit down to 5.5 per cent of GDP -
the target recommended by international financial institutions, which has
been missed for several years.
There must be doubts about how lasting measures can be if taken by a
neutral, caretaker government, given that its successor which is elected in
October will again face familiar political constraints.
The best hope, however, is that the incoming government will feel bound by
economic necessity to abide by the terms of the agreement which Mr Qureshi
hopes to reach with the IMF, particularly as it will partially escape the
unpopularity which naturally goes with agreeing to IMF strictures.
Moreover, Mr Qureshi has the backing of the army, which brokered the
resignation deal which brought him into office. Though the army has proved
that it is no longer interested in wielding power directly, it remains a
powerful force in the background.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Mideast talks 'back on track' - Christopher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, who is shuttling between
Middle East states, appeared yesterday to be edging towards progress on the
deadlock in peace talks between Syria and Israel.
However, Mr Christopher failed to bridge differences between Israel and
Palestinians, central to a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The developments came as it emerged that Mr Yossi Sarid, a moderate in the
Israeli cabinet, and environment minister, had talks with a senior official
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation with the approval of Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel's prime minister. Mr Sarid's meeting with Mr Nabil Shaath,
adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in Cairo last month, is the first
such contact and will further erode the Israeli taboo on talks with the PLO.
After meeting Mr Rabin yesterday Mr Christopher declared the peace talks
'back on track' and said he would be holding an unscheduled second round of
talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria today. His announcement fuelled
speculation of modest progress in talks between Israel and Syria which focus
on an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, seized in the 1967
Middle East war, in return for a full peace including trade and diplomatic
relations and security guarantees.
Mr Rabin said Mr Christopher brought 'good news' from Damascus but he
cautioned: 'It is only the beginning. We still have a long way to go.'
US officials with Mr Christopher refused to specify the nature of the
apparent progress but said the US had increased its role in the peace
process from that of an 'honest broker' to being an 'active intermediary'.
The US wants to lay the ground now for the 11th round of peace talks,
expected to be held in Washington in September. However, discussions between
Palestinians and Israelis on a two-phased settlement remain blocked over the
nature of an interim five-year period of limited Palestinian self-rule in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The US is pressing for acceptance by both sides of its draft statement of
principles which promises the Palestinians an early transfer of
administrative functions over areas such as health, education and police, -
but excludes control by Palestinians over Arab East Jerusalem and the Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories.
Palestinians leaders, some of whom boycotted Mr Christopher's visit, reject
the document as being pro-Israeli and are trying to persuade the US to start
talks about the final status of a Palestinian entity. Israel opposes such a
move. The shape of the joint statement has become crucial because both sides
believe what they agree to now will determine the shape of a final
Palestinian entity.

Zimbabwe's government will not back down on plans to force white farmers to
sell their land, Mr Kumbirai Kangai, the agriculture minister, said at the
annual congress of the Commercial Farmers' Union which ended yesterday,
Reuter reports from Harare.
There would be social strife without land reform, the minister said. 'Land
just has to be redistributed because if it is not, then those with no land
will take the law into their own hands and there will be social trouble,'
said the minister.
CFU delegates said the government had a 'racial agenda' in its land
redistribution programme.

<TEXT>
Machine tool orders in Japan were down by more than a quarter in the first
half of the year and orders for the whole year may be the lowest for a
decade as domestic manufacturers continue to cut capital spending, writes
Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
The Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association said yesterday that orders for
the six months to June were Y287.3bn (Pounds 1.82bn), down 25.6 per cent.
Export orders were down only 8.6 per cent from the same period of 1992 but
those placed by customers at home fell 33.2 per cent.
It said that in the absence of a sharp recovery, full-year order intake may
emerge at only some Y600bn. This would bring them back to or even below the
levels of 1982-83 and more than halved from their peak Y1,412bn achieved in
1990.
Orders from Japanese automotive and electronics groups, the two main sets of
customers, each fell by more than a third amid overcapacity and weak
consumer demand for their end-products.

ORDERS received by US factories rebounded 2.6 per cent in June, the first
rise in three months and the biggest increase this year, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
In another positive report, the US Labour Department yesterday indicated a
decline in the number of workers filing new unemployment claims in the week
ending July 31. Claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 336,000, against
396,000 a week earlier.
In all, new orders for manufactured goods increased Dollars 6.4bn in June,
following a 1.6 per cent drop in May. New orders for the first half of this
year were 6.1 per cent ahead of the equivalent period in 1992. Orders for
defence goods, which have been declining, were up 8.1 per cent, the first
rise since March. Excluding the defence category, orders still rose 2.5 per
cent.
The orders rise was above Wall Street economists' expectations of a 2 per
cent increase.
Transportation equipment provided the largest increase in June, most of it
for aircraft and parts. Excluding transport equipment, new orders for
durable goods increased by only 0.3 per cent.
The rise was more significant in the non-durable goods sector, where orders
rose 1.3 per cent to Dollars 124.1bn for products such as chemicals and
foods.
Shipments of both durable and non-durable goods rose in June, by 2.3 per
cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. However, the number of unfilled orders
declined, particularly for durable goods, which fell to the lowest level
since August 1988.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US judge yesterday rejected the argument of the owners of America's
professional baseball teams that their sport should remain exempt from US
anti-trust laws.
The lawsuit had been brought by two Pennsylvania businessman prevented by
other baseball owners from buying the San Francisco Giants team last year
and moving it to Florida.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1922 that the sport was not 'interstate
commerce', and thus not subject to anti-trust legislation, which prohibits
unregulated business monopolies. A series of court cases since have upheld
the decision.
Yesterday's ruling, however, is the most serious challenge yet to baseball's
exemption. US district court judge John Padova ruled that baseball's
exemption relates only to players' contracts, not to the buying and selling
of teams.
Anti-trust exemption has allowed owners to join forces to determine all the
big issues that affect baseball, such as the ownership of teams, the moving
of teams, and the negotiation of highly lucrative television contracts.
In March, a bill was introduced in the Senate that would end the sport's
immunity from anti-trust laws. Congressional critics argue that baseball is
no longer a sport run by owners in the public interest, but a sport run
purely for profit.

FT  06 AUG 93 / A need to pedal out of poverty in Bolivia: The new
president's problems in the poorest country of South America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROUCHED at the side of a dirt road in the 12 de Octubre market in El Alto,
the working-class township on the rim of the canyon above the Bolivian
capital, La Paz, with a huge pile of gnarled potatoes spread on a blanket in
front of her, Mrs Celia Ticono de Medina does not think highly of economic
stabilisation programmes.
Wrapped against the biting Andean air, in a colourful shawl with a
pink-faced baby suckling at her breast, she tips her bowler hat and opens
her mouth to reveal rotting teeth, blackened from chewing coca leaves to
stave off hunger.
Mrs Medina, aged far beyond her 32 years, has journeyed all night on the
back of a truck from the mining town of Potos to sell the potatoes for the
equivalent of a few dollars, however long it takes. She has five children
and is married to a miner who lost his job in 1985 during the government's
radical adjustment programme, often cited as the most successful such
revision carried out under democracy in Latin America. Mrs Medina is not
convinced: 'You can't eat stability.'
Bolivia has reduced annual inflation from 26,000 per cent to less than 10 -
the lowest in South America - and is seen as a model of how to tackle
hyperinflation and debt crisis in a democracy. But it also illustrates the
fact that economic stability does not necessarily bring prosperity. The
poorest country in the region, its return to economic growth since 1987 has
barely outpaced population growth.
Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the victor of the presidential election held
in June, is due to be sworn in as president today - independence day. He was
planning minister in 1985-89 and the main author of economic adjustment.
Combating poverty and improving wealth distribution are the main challenges
facing him and he has no doubt about what voters want. 'The onus is on me to
get the economy moving and get money to the forgotten people,' he says.
Mr Palmiro Sora Sauzedo, assistant director of Plan International, a
development agency, warns: 'It's time to democratise the economy as well as
politics. Otherwise that was the last vote for the free market option'.
For the average Bolivian, the costs of balancing the budget have seemed more
tangible than the benefits. Living costs spiralled after the government
slashed subsidies and raised public sector tariffs; unemployment rose with
the sacking of state employees, including 23,000 metals miners; drastic cuts
in import tariffs have made life hard for local industry; the budget squeeze
has hit provision of public services.
According to the World Bank, Bolivia's per capita income has fallen more
than 20 per cent since 1980 to Dollars 700 (Pounds 469.70) now. The rural
population has been hit hardest. Bolivia has the highest percentage of rural
poverty in the world, with 97 per cent of the rural population below the
poverty line according to the UN International Fund for Agricultural
Development, compared to 85 per cent in 1986. Also during this period, the
rural population increased by 1.4m to 3.4m  - about half the country's
total.
Nowhere is this clearer than on the altiplano, the high Andean plain on
which 70 per cent of the rural population live. Scenes of llamas grazing on
the shores of Lake Titicaca, under the snow-capped Mount Illimani, look
misleadingly idyllic. Here average life expectancy is 46 years, infant
mortality is 172 per 1,000 live births and family income averages 72
bolivianos (Pounds 11.40) a month.
Mr Sandro Calvani, head of the UN Drug Control Programme in Bolivia and
former World Health Organisation representative in Africa, says, 'poverty
here is worse than in Ethiopia or Burkino Faso.' He is not surprised that,
for many, growing the coca leaf is the only way.
Some 10 per cent of the working population is involved in the coca trade,
including many former miners. Bolivia is now the second largest producer of
coca after Peru (and of cocaine after Colombia), generating some Dollars
650m-Dollars 700m a year, of which some Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m stays in
the country.
Rather than construct a real alternative to this ancient cultivation turned
drug source for the developed world, Bolivia has become highly dependent on
foreign aid. By contrast, foreign investment has been deterred by dithering
government in the face of strong union opposition. Exports are declining - a
trade surplus of Dollars 104m in 1989 had turned into a Dollars 561m deficit
last year, the worst in a decade.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada denies that the adjustment programme has worsened
conditions: 'That's like blaming the fireman for the fire. People forget
that, from 1980 till adjustment in 1985, GNP shrank 27 per cent because of
the collapse in tin prices (Bolivia's main legal export) and the debt
crisis. We found a very poor country with hyperinflation and left a very
poor country without hyperinflation.'
He blames the last government for not building on stabilisation. 'The
problem is that, since then, we've had stagnation and thus not dealt with
the terrible social problems left over from the 1980s.'
The new president plans an ambitious transfer of wealth through the
distribution of shares in state companies worth an estimated Dollars 4,000
per person. He declares: 'Stability is like a bike. We've stabilised and
must now start pedallling, otherwise we will fall.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Hochtief to build new airport for Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOCHTIEF, one of Germany's largest construction companies, has won a DM4bn
(Dollars 2.3bn) contract from the Greek government to build and run a new
airport at Spata 16 miles from Athens.
The airport is intended to serve as the regional hub for southeast Europe.
The Greek government says it will replace the existing airport in Athens,
which has been criticised by local residents for its high level of noise
pollution.
Under the terms of the deal, the airport will be operated for 50 years by a
company owned 40 per cent by the Greek state and 60 per cent by a
Hochtief-led consortium.
The latter includes Asea Brown Boveri-Germany from the Swiss-Scandinavian
group, Krantz TKT, a subsidiary of the Deutsche Babcock engineering group,
and Flughafen Frankfurt Main company, which runs Frankfurt airport. The
principal Greek subcontractor will be Mechaniki, a northern Greek
construction concern.
The Greek partner will provide 35 per cent of the financing through an
Ecu400m (Dollars 452m) grant from the European Community and is raising the
remainder of its contribution through an airport transit tax.
The controversial tax was imposed earlier this year on passengers using
existing Greek airports.
The German side will contribute the rest of the financing. Hochtief said its
initial capital commitment would be Ecu180m.
The construction is expected to take 51 months and the airport is due to be
operational in 1998.
The German companies won the contract after being short-listed with a
French-Greek consortium led by Societe Auxilliaire d'Entreprises de France
and Aeroport de Paris.
Hochtief said the key factor in winning the contract was the willingness of
the German consortium to allow the Greek state a larger equity stake in the
airport company.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Mexico-US environment fund proposed -
Clinton administration seeks special facility to raise Dollars 20bn for
border projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration has suggested to Mexico that the countries set up
a finance facility, only loosely linked with the InterAmerican Development
Bank, to raise up to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn) for environmental projects
at the border.
The proposal is part of negotiations on the North American Free Trade
Agreement now under way in Washington. The trade ministers of the US, Canada
and Mexico met again yesterday to take up where their subordinates left off
in talks throughout the week.
The official word was that progress was being made but reports filtering out
of the negotiations indicated otherwise - only partly due to the US desire
to hold the Nafta grand finale after Congress has approved a new budget. The
US is still insisting on the use of trade sanctions to enforce environment
and labour aspects of the agreement; Canada and Mexico are, to different
degrees, still resisting.
Although the administration is proposing a stand-alone financing facility
for the environment for the first time, the idea is stirring little
excitement in Congress, where several Democrats are still hoping for the
creation of a North American Development Bank.
The Clinton plan is for a border institution, established through
presidential agreement between the US and Mexico. It would co-ordinate a
regional plan on the environment, review project designs for dealing with
waste water and industrial pollution, assess the technical and financial
feasibility of proposed projects, and oversee construction and operation.
It would also mobilise private sector finance, direct government supports
(loans, guarantees, equity finance) and provide money through the finance
facility.
The latter would be separately chartered and capitalised by the US, which
would provide 85 per cent of the Dollars 525m in paid-in capital, and
Mexico, which would provide the rest. It would be capitalised initially at
Dollars 5.025bn, a sum expected to yield up to Dollars 20bn for lending. The
IADB would be associated with it in some form of advisory capacity.
The scheme has been criticised as inadequate by Mr Albert Jacquez, chief of
staff to Congressman Esteban Torres, who has introduced legislation to
create a North American Development Bank.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has sought to quell rising protests at a law which
eliminates rent controls and curbs tenants' rights in Mexico City. It has
promised to protect existing tenants from the law's impact for five years.
The law, passed by Congress last month, removes ceilings on rent increases,
eliminates the one-year minimum for a housing contract, and simplifies the
legal eviction of a tenant. The aim was for the law to stimulate investment
in Mexico City's housing market, widely believed to have been depressed by
the rent controls and tenants' rights.
However, citizens' groups, unions and opposition parties bitterly opposed
the law, and led street protests against it.
President Carlos Salinas has partly bowed to this by promising to postpone
application of the legislation to existing tenants for five years. He will
also propose measures to stimulate housing investment.
The new law will apply to all new tenants, though, so citizens' groups are
to continue their protests.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Argentina's Inflation falls to lowest
level in 24 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in Argentina has fallen to its lowest level in 24 years, reaching
a monthly rate of just 0.3 per cent in July, the government announced,
writes John Barham.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said the fall meant Argentina's
inflation was converging with 'those of developed countries'. Achieving
inflation rates close to international levels has been one of Mr Cavallo's
overriding objectives.
In April 1991, he pegged Argentina's peso to the dollar, and has been
striving since then to lower inflation to US levels and avoid an irreparable
overvaluation of the peso.
However, improved price stability seems to have been achieved at the cost of
rising unemployment and deteriorating external accounts. Although exports
are improving, imports are increasing at a much faster rate. The first
quarter trade deficit rose 57 per cent to Dollars 511m (Pounds 343m).
According to preliminary government data, unemployment rose to 8.9 per cent
in May against 6.9 per cent a year earlier. Underemployment is estimated at
a further 10 per cent. These are the highest rates in 20 years and rival
unemployment during the 1989-90 crisis of hyperinflation.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: UK exports 'lose out' in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH exporters to Argentina complain that the prohibitive cost of
recently extended government export insurance is losing them business in one
of Latin America's fastest growing markets, writes John Barham.
The UK government's Export Credits Guarantee Department resumed coverage to
Argentina in June, after an 11-year absence following the 1982 Falklands
war.
However, exporters see it as no more than an empty political gesture. No
company has taken out the Pounds 100m-worth of cover available for Argentina
because of its cost. Exporters must pay a 14 per cent premium (almost three
times the premium charged by other countries' export credit agencies) plus a
further 8 per cent annual interest rate.
Mr Daniel Corallo, president of Capime, a local company representing UK
power engineering company John Brown Engineering, says British goods are
well-priced, but lose to competitors backed by state-subsidised export
finance.
Mr Carlyle David of the ECGD says its computerised system enables it to
'assess risk objectively and set premiums and cover appropriate to those
risks.' Argentina has a 'fairly high risk, so we regard the amount of cover
allocated as sufficient'.
British exports to Argentina rose 51 per cent in the first five months of
this year.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan power proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN Power, the state electricity generating monopoly, is taking steps to
diversify the island's sources of pow
If the government approves the measures will allow independent power
generators to enter the Taiwan market. They would build, own and operate
their own plants, the costs of which would be recovered through the sale of
electricity to Taipower. The plan could be the first step in a deregulation
of the sector.
According to the company, 10 sites have been selected. Initially, they would
only be open to Taiwan investors, although foreign investment would be a
logical next step. Power plants of up to 750MW could be built on the sites.
Nearly all the principal equipment would be bought from foreign suppliers.
Taiwan's aggressive power expansion programme has prompted the need for
private sector capital. Taipower's installed capacity is more than 19,000MW,
but it intends to increase this to 30,000MW by the year 2000. Analysts say
this will require an investment of at least Dollars 14bn.
The state utility, which operates 56 power stations, three of them nuclear,
wants to unload some of the burden of environmental responsibility on the
private sector. Taiwan's environmental lobby has been active in opposing new
power stations, particularly the proposed 2,300MW of nuclear capacity
planned for Yenliao in northern Taiwan. The Yenliao project is currently out
to tender.

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Menem finds that free trade is something
of a mixed blessing - Second thoughts in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STEADILY deteriorating trade balance and approaching elections are forcing
Argentina to backtrack gradually on its free trade policies. In recent weeks
it has resorted to a battery of protectionist measures aimed mainly at
Brazil, its principal trading partner with which it is trying to consolidate
Mercosur, a four-nation regional common market with Uruguay and Paraguay.
Claiming that recession-bound Brazilian companies have captured excessive
shares of the paper market, Argentina last month imposed quotas for some
paper products. Then, it announced an 18-month halt to preferential tariffs
on Brazilian refrigeration equipment. Now, it has placed extra duties on
textiles and is considering further protection for the petrochemicals
industry.
All this is welcomed by hard-pressed industrialists who had accused
President Carlos Menem's government of being 'anti-industry', pursuing
policies that have led to unrestrained import competition, rising costs, an
overvalued currency and excessive taxation.
Mr Jorge Blanco Villegas, president of the Argentine Industrial Union which
represents manufacturers, complained that 'in a world of recession and
change, no serious country cheerfully gives away its (domestic) markets'.
Textile imports had risen 89 per cent in the first half of this year, and
paper imports had captured a third of the market.
This is not the first time Argentina has retaliated against Brazil. Last
October, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, trebled to 10 per cent a tax
on imports, aimed specifically at Brazilian goods.
Officials blamed Brazil's severe recession, covert subsidies and an
aggressive exchange rate for unleashing a torrent of exports to Argentina.
Half the 1992 trade deficit of Dollars 2.62bn - Argentina's first since 1981
 -was with Brazil. However, despite last year's tax increase, this year's
first quarter Dollars 511m deficit was up by 57 per cent.
The friction comes against a background of steadily increasing trade between
South America's largest economies. Reductions in tariffs called for by
Mercosur helped to boost bilateral trade by two-thirds last year to Dollars
4.93bn and Brazil is now Argentina's biggest export market as well as its
biggest supplier.
Brazil has reduced its surplus with Argentina by more than half in the first
quarter of 1993, by importing more Argentine flour and crude oil. But
Argentines complain that trade is one sided: Argentina is becoming an
exporter of raw materials to Brazil and an importer of Brazilian
manufactures.
Mr Carlos Magarinos, trade undersecretary, says the more aggressive trade
policies are part of a wider change in industrial policy. Most of
Argentina's companies are small, incorporate little technology and produce a
wide range of products inefficiently. The government wants them to gain
economies of scale by narrowing product ranges and investing more in
technology. Companies which can show they have made efforts to change but
remain exposed to predatory exporters can expect a sympathetic hearing from
the government.
Argentina's trade deficit has also become a political problem, with the
opposition railing against government 'insensitivity' to industry's
problems. They accuse Mr Menem of repeating an earlier experiment with free
trade that ended disastrously in 1981 with mounting bankruptcies, current
account deficits and devaluation.
With important congressional elections due in October, Mr Magarinos says 'we
must take care of the (trade liberalisation) process to avoid criticisms. It
must continue and be done reasonably.' Otherwise, he fears, people 'would
say 'we cannot trust (the government) with our future' and vote against us,
and they would be right. And then (other parties) would come and close the
economy again.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US steel-makers want injury rulings
changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US CARBON steel producers are citing a plunge in their shareslast week as an
argument for a rare reconsideration by the US International Trade Commission
of many of the steel cases which last week went against them.
The commission's findings shocked many who had expected injury findings, and
higher tariffs as a result, on most of the 72 complaints brought by the
industry.
In a new petition, submitted last Tuesday, the 12 largest steel producers
said 40 negative injury findings by the ITC, and the share sell-off which
followed, wiped out more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 671m) in their market
value. This had affected their ability to raise capital and maintain
investment needed to remain competitive in flat-rolled steel markets.
The six ITC commissioners, who will take a written vote on the petition,
have until Monday to submit their injury decisions formally to the Commerce
Department. The steel companies have asked them to reopen the case and 'to
issue an appropriate modification and correction' when they vote on Monday.
'Such a final vote will permit the commission to take proper note of the
devastating impact of continued unfair trade in carbon steel flat products
on the financial state of petitioners and their ability to raise necessary
investment capital,' the new petition says.

FT  06 AUG 93 / LA police sentences may go to appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US JUSTICE Department is considering whether to appeal against the 2 1/2
 year jail sentences received by two white Los Angeles policemen convicted
on federal charges over the beating of Mr Rodney King, a black motorist.
The earlier acquittal on California state charges of all four police
officers involved in the incident led to rioting in Los Angeles last year
that left 54 dead and an estimated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) in damage. The
severe beating of Mr King after a high-speed car chase in March 1991 was
videotaped by a bystander.
Prosecutors in the federal case had been seeking the maximum sentence - 10
years in jail and fines of up to Dollars 250,000. Explaining his leniency,
Judge John Davies said that Mr King had brought much of the violence upon
himself by resisting arrest.
The judge also criticised federal prosecutors for having put the officers
through a second trial after they had been acquitted in a state court.
There has been no violent reaction to the sentences handed down on
Wednedsay. However, they stirred anger and dismay in the Los Angeles black
community and a bitter response from Mr King. In a television interview
yesterday, he said that, if he had been facing similar charges, 'I would
have been doing 10, 15 years. But once you're going up against police
officers, it's hard to prove it. Who's going to believe you?'
'This is a travesty of justice, as opposed to a measure of justice,' said Mr
Joseph Duff, president of the LA chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. Mr Mark Whitlock, executive director of LA
Renaissance, a black community support group, charged that the sentences
would further erode faith in the fairness of the courts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S foreign exchange reserves were swollen by nearly DM8bn (Pounds
3.1bn) last week as a result of speculative currency inflows, but this
figure does not yet include the full impact of the Bundesbank's intervention
to prop up the French franc, the Bundesbank said in its weekly statement.
This omission is because of the usual delay in reporting foreign exchange
transactions. The support operations involving the German central bank at
the end of July will thus show up in next week's statement, it said.
The DM7.7bn rise in reserves, mostly reflecting Bundesbank currency
intervention, brought the total up to DM118.6bn. However, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said on Monday that the central bank's
intervention had led to inflows of DM60bn last month, nearly half of this on
Friday.
After the currency markets chaos and the widening of fluctuation bands in
the European exchange rate mechanism, the Bundesbank has started to mop up
the excess liquidity to try to prevent further growth in the money supply
and price inflation.
In this week's securities repurchase (repo) operations with commercial
banks, it drained DM38bn of liquidity from the system.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Summer scrutiny for Paris bankers keen to advise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERCHANT banker confessed: 'I haven't been this nervous since my
university exams.' Then he set off for an appointment at the French Finance
Ministry on the bank of the River Seine in eastern Paris.
His anxiety, shared by about 100 counterparts in international corporate
finance over the past two days, was caused by the prospect of a rigorous
oral examination by a panel of five senior French bureaucrats and financial
experts.
The aim is for one's merchant bank to be chosen for an advisory role in the
French government's ambitious privatisation campaign, to be launched in the
autumn with the sale of the state's shareholdings in Rhone Poulenc, the
chemicals group, and Banque Nationale de Paris. The challenge is to survive
the peculiarly French selection.
'It isn't easy,' said one member of a hopeful corporate finance team. 'They
can ask you pretty much anything - what you think cash flow will be in two
years' time, who founded the company and when, or what effects the widening
of European exchange rate bands will have on profit margins.'
They may not feel it but the visitors to the treasury over the past few days
are the lucky ones, having already passed a written examination, which
reduced the number of merchant bank applications from more than 60 to fewer
than 20, and which laid out the claimants' case for selection. Written
submissions were limited to 50 pages - 20 of text and 30 of footnotes -
after the previous privatisation programme, when a series of massive tomes
was delivered to the treasury.
As the total has been shrunk so the the competition has been intensified.
The selection panel is expected to name only a few winners.
The rewards, initially at least, are not expected to be big. 'The treasury
doesn't pay much for an adviser,' said one member of a five-man team seeking
selection, 'but there is a lot of prestige attached.'
Companies selected as advisers, and even those that come close, also stand
an excellent chance of being picked for the underwriting syndicates which
sell the privatisation share issues. There, the financial rewards become
very big.
'You can count on a 2-3 per cent commission on your share of the sale,' said
one banker. With the government's 73 per cent of BNP worth up to FFr29bn
(Pounds 3.3bn), and its 43 per cent share of Rhone Poulenc valued at
FFr12bn-FFr15bn, that could mean substantial returns.
The treasury panel is expected to announce the winners within a week.
Meanwhile, Paris will be home to a lot of nervous merchant bankers this
weekend.

FT  06 AUG 93 / French bank privatisation upsets the secret liaisons: The
government has dominated banking with its ownership of 'les trois vieilles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Banque Nationale de Paris, the bastion of France's state-controlled
banks, is privatised this autumn, the sale will mark the start of a new era,
not only for the bank, but for the French government's relationship with the
banking industry.
For decades the French government has dominated the banking sector mainly by
its ownership of the leading commercial banks - BNP, Societe Generale and
Credit Lyonnais, known as les trois vieilles, the 'three old ladies'. The
state has not only had direct influence over those banks - choosing their
chairmen and scrutinising strategy - but through them has indirectly
influenced developments across the industry.
Societe Generale was sold to the private sector by the last centre-right
administration in 1987. BNP will be the second of the three to be
privatised, with Credit Lyonnais scheduled for sale before the 1995
presidential elections. The sale of two, and eventually all three, of the
'old ladies' will dramatically diminish government influence over the
banking scene.
One of the most significant changes will be in the selection of senior
personnel. The government has traditionally appointed the chairmen of the
state-controlled banks. The candidates were invariably fonctionnaires, or
civil servants. The chairmen - Mr Michel Pebereau at BNP, MrMarc Vienot at
Societe Generale and Mr Jean-Yves Haberer at Credit Lyonnais - have all
worked at the treasury and ministers' private offices.
The choice of chairmen is intensely political. A change of government, or
the end of the chairmen's three-year contracts, triggers a game of musical
chairs. The new government has already replaced Mr Rene Thomas as chairman
of BNP with Mr Pebereau, who worked for conservative ministers earlier in
his career. Some financiers suspect the next victim may be Mr Haberer, who
was fired from Paribas by the conservatives in 1986 and appointed to Credit
Lyonnais by the Socialists.
After privatisation the banks' chairmen will be chosen by shareholders as at
any other private company. This should ensure that the big French banks are
no longer prey to sudden shifts in strategy. It should also make their
senior executives less vulnerable to political pressure over corporate
strategy and their role in economic policy.
The precise nature of the relationship between the French government and the
public sector banks is shrouded in secrecy. The banks claim they are
independent. Other financiers disagree. 'France is a country where banks
have traditionally been tools of the state,' says one Paris banker. 'There
are instances when ministers shout instructions down the telephone, but
mostly they don't need to. The government puts its own people in charge, who
know exactly what it wants them to do.'
One of the most sensitive areas is interest rates, specifically the degree
to which the government uses the state banks to control base rates. In
recent months, when the government has been anxious to keep rates low for
fear of aggravating the recession, BNP and Credit Lyonnais have led the rate
reductions, whereas the private banks, notably Societe Generale, have been
the first to raise them. The privatisation programme, which coincides with
the independence of the Bank of France, should mark the end of this
practice.
It should also be more difficult for the government to use the banks as
tools in industrial policy. The state banks have inherited large stakes in
other public sector companies as part of the regular reshuffles of the
government's industrial holdings.
However the tradition of the 'industrial bank' is so well-entrenched in
France that, even if the banks stop taking stakes in public sector
companies, they are likely to continue to invest in the private sector as
Societe Generale has done.
Similarly it will take a long time for the French banks to lose the
fonctionnaire culture left by years of government control. The
state-appointed chairmen have filled junior positions at the banks with
fellow civil servants. Analysts suspect this public sector ethos has
contributed to the French banks' cautious approach to international
expansion and to their bureaucratic management structures.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Swedish rates cut to 10-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SWEDEN, engulfed by last year's ERM crisis, yesterday took advantage of its
position on the sidelines of the latest upheaval by announcing a cut in
interest rates to the lowest levels for more than 10 years, to encourage
recovery from the country's deepest recession since 1945.
A strengthening of the Swedish krona since the weekend allowed the Riksbank,
the central bank, the scope to cut its key marginal rate from 8.5 to 8.25
per cent, despite the bank's official view that it would like to see a
further rise in the currency's value.
Yesterday, the krona stood at SKr4.68 against the D-Mark, up from near
SKr4.75 at the end of last week.
The contrast with the events of last autumn was stark. Then, overnight
lending rates were pushed up to 500 per cent in a vain bid to keep the krona
pegged to the ERM as Sweden prepared to join the European Community. Since
then, the marginal rate has been steadily brought down from the level of
12.5 per cent last November.
The benefits of looser monetary policy and increased export competivity are
the chief hopes for a return to growth next year after three successive
years of contraction in the economy.
Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor, said there was no early
intention to reinstate a pegged exchange rate.
Finland is in a similar position. It recently revised downwards its
forecasts for the economy, predicting a 2 per cent fall in GDP this year and
only 'minor' growth next year, rather than the 3.5 per cent growth it had
foreseen.
In both countries, unemployment is expected to go on rising into next year.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Alcohol market in EC 'worth Pounds 95bn annually'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's alcoholic drinks market is worth Pounds 95bn a
year, according to a report published yesterday.
About 225m people - 85 per cent of EC adults - are drinkers, consuming
between them 26.6bn litres of beer, 13.7bn litres of wine, and 1.8bn litres
of spirits a year.
The French, Germans and Spanish are the heaviest drinkers; the British and
Irish among the most abstemious. The average European's annual consumption
of 9.8 litres of pure alcohol, however, has fallen nearly 15 per cent since
1980.
The drinks industry provides full-time employment for about 3m people in
production and distribution, 2 per cent of all EC jobs.
It contributes a Pounds 4bn trade surplus to the Community, and it raises
Pounds 36bn in tax revenues, almost enough to fund the EC Commission's
annual budget.
To raise an equivalent amount, EC governments would need to increase income
tax rates by 12 per cent or VAT rates by 16 per cent.
This assessment of the industry's economic importance by the European
Insistute of Business Administration is included in a report submitted to
the European Commission by the Amsterdam Group, formed by leading drinks
companies to help combat alcohol abuse.
Mr Richard Owen, chairman of the group's committee responsible for the
report, said yesterday: 'The industry has a vested interest in encouraging
responsible drinking among the majority while actively discouraging alcohol
abuse by a small minority.'
It is estimated that while more than 90 per cent of consumers drink in
moderation between 4 and 7 per cent drink excessively.
The report agrees there is a range of significant health risks from
excessive consumption, but argues that moderate drinking alone poses no
problems and can be beneficial.
Attempts to curb overall drinking have little or no effect on irresponsible
drinkers, it says. The report recommends the extension of information and
education programmes but suggests that the most effective alcohol policies
are developed at national level.
'No reasonable case can be made on social, health or economic grounds for
curbing the industry's right to normal commercial freedoms,' it concludes.

maker's supervisory board, writes Christopher Parkes.
The group's stocks rose DM12.5 to reach DM374 at the official close, but
continued climbing in after-market trading, reaching DM377.20 by late

FT  06 AUG 93 / VW looks for a smoother ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS Mr Ferdinand Piech is growing to appreciate, foot-in-mouth disease is a
painful affliction. The Volkswagen chairman and self-proclaimed
saviour-to-be of the European car industry may yet discover that it is also
difficult and costly to cure, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
The ailment is in its early stages, but the symptoms are severe. Following
repeated manifestations over the past few weeks, Mr Piech's case will be
subjected to a close examination at an extraordinary meeting of VW's
supervisory board in Wolfsburg tonight.
The sitting was called by Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of Essen-based Ruhrgas
and head of the VW supervisory board, and Mr Piech himself, to discuss the
state of the business and the 'matter' between Volkswagen and General Motors
of the US and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel.
The summons followed signs of wavering in the board after a series of public
relations catastrophes which thickened rather than dispersed the clouds of
suspicion circling Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director
and linchpin of Mr Piech's recovery programme.
Mr Klaus Volkert, senior representative of the workforce on the supervisory
board, on which union, employee and Social Democrat party officials hold 11
of the 20 seats, said if spying charges against Mr Lopez seemed likely, he
would withdraw his support. Until then, the board had agreed to stand fast,
even if Mr Lopez, former head of GM's global procurement, was charged with
industrial espionage, until the charges were proven.
Mr Volkert's resolve appeared to wobble after a miscued offensive last week
in which Mr Piech said the public prosecutor's office was biased and accused
GM of 'shady manoeuvrings' and a personal vendetta against Mr Lopez, with
the aim of destroying VW.
Indirectly, he named Opel as US agent provocateur in an economic war against
the European motor industry.
Mr Piech, apparently unawares, had selected a boomerang for his attack. It
brought in its wake a storm of outrage from all sides of German industry and
politics. There were calls for Mr Lopez to be either fired or suspended
pending charges or a court verdict. But the main message was that Mr Piech
and his 'nationalist' tones were damaging Germany's reputation.
His offensive, designed to offset damage done in a recent court case when VW
failed to prevent Der Spiegel, a news weekly, from reporting detailed
suspicions of spying against Mr Lopez, had backfired.
The irony is that the investment community whole-heartedly accepts that his
and Mr Lopez's vigorous restructuring efforts are already having a
substantial effect, and profits will start to grow next year. But even among
such cool heads there is bewilderment at constant claims that the group will
be out of the red by the end of this year.
According to analysts' calculations, a loss of around DM700m (Pounds 270m)
is unavoidable. 'I can't think they have been trying to mislead us, but if
they are, why?' one asks.
The question is symptomatic. The charitable answer is that Mr Piech,
blinkered by his zeal for saving VW and believing the results would speak
for themselves, may have scope for improvement as a public relations man.
Similar questions may arise at tonight's meeting, at which Mr Piech is
expected to concede that his cost-cutting drive has left gaping holes in his
PR defences which need to be filled, possibly with a new management board
director.
But at the end of the night, supervisors will almost certainly close ranks
with managers. Mr Liesen, Mr Volkert and his colleagues, executives of
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the premier of Lower Saxony and other
worthies are the men who chose the managers they believed best able to save
Europe's biggest car maker. Mr Piech has staked his reputation on his belief
in Mr Lopez. If anyone hangs, then all will hang together.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Allies remain hesitant over air strikes: It is still unclear
if the allies will fulfil threats to act against the Serbs encircling
Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR NATO commanders met at the allied headquarters in Belgium yesterday
to draw up logistical plans for possible air strikes to be presented to a
meeting of the organisation's military committee today.
But as the diplomatic wrangling continued between the US and UN about who
should control the air strikes and what their objective should be, it was
still unclear whether the allies would fulfil their threats to act against
the Serb forces encircling Sarajevo.
An official at the British Ministry of Defence said: 'As far as we are
concerned, we are ready to go in if the order is given.
'But to start military action you need a clear military objective and a
clear political aim. The problem is we don't have either yet.'
Under the terms of the compromise agreement hammered out after 12 hours of
acrimonious discussions in Brussels three days ago, Nato has threatened to
launch air strikes for two separate purposes: first, to defend UN troops in
Bosnia if they come under attack; and second, to break the Serbian
'stranglehold' on Sarajevo.
Under pressure from the European allies, who are determined to avoid being
sucked into further military conflict, Nato diplomats yesterday stressed
they would seek UN authority to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they block aid
convoys, but would not interfere in battles like those taking place in the
mountains around Sarajevo.
'We are essentially just fulfilling the UN humanitarian mandate. We have no
other purpose there,' a Nato official in Brussels yesterday said.
But recent statements from the White House have prompted some European
observers to fear that the US is considering an expanded military aim for
the air strikes: to attack key Serbian positions outside Sarajevo or even
target specific commanders and buildings.
Considerable disagreement between the US and the European allies persists
even about what the definitions of self-defence and the UN's humanitarian
mission should be.
These stem in part from the different dispositions (if any) of the troops of
the western allies.
The Canadians, with ground troops in Srebrenica surrounded by Serbian
forces, were the most vociferous this week in arguing against Washington
proposals for air strikes. The French, with troops in Sarajevo and recently
under Serb fire, have also expressed fears that air strikes other than those
launched to fend off any attacks could endanger forces on the ground.
There are also doubts in Europe about the effectiveness of air power on its
own. A French military expert yesterday said that although France had agreed
to the bombing of Serbian positions because the fall of Sarajevo was at
stake, it had doubts about what it will really achieve.
He added that France's position was based on a desire to show support for
Moslems - and on deep uncertainty, shared by most of its allies, over what
to do should Sarajevo fall.
Britain's troops are primarily located in Moslem and Croat areas, but Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, was yesterday at pains to stress
that the protection of the troops remained at the forefront of British
policy.
The allies' caution has been accompanied by anger that the American
proposals for air strikes have been made without any commitment for American
ground troops in Bosnia.
Echoing fears that other military officials have expressed, Dr Jonathan Eyal
of the Royal United Services Institute in London yesterday said: 'The fear
is that the UN is merely acting as a fig leaf for the Americans. They will
go in and then get out again like they did in Somalia, leaving the UN and
the allies picking up the pieces.'
Against this background, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, has
reiterated that he wishes to retain full control of any action in Bosnia.
UN officials, together with the French, have argued that the operations
should remain under the control of the French commander of the UN forces in
the former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot.
The Americans, by contrast, are insisting that air strikes should be
co-ordinated by Admiral Jeremy Boorda, commander of the Allied Forces
Southern Europe.
Nato officials yesterday insisted that although they were prepared to act
under a United Nations brief, Nato was the only institution with sufficient
military experience to run the operations.
'The UN is a political and cultural institution. It does not have the
experience to run a military operation,' said a Nato official.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ITS NAME suggests, the prime function of a German company's supervisory
board is to oversee the activities of the board of management, ensuring
efficiency and proper conduct.
Its key active roles include the selection of executive directors and
approval of large capital investments or acquisitions.
In principle, though not in law, 'the supervisory board bears the same
responsibility for mistakes as the management board,' according to Mr Tom
Sommerlatte, European head of the Arthur D. Little consultancy.
The composition varies, but certain constants apply. Large shareholders,
often banks, are strongly represented; retired senior management board
members are almost always found a place, with other seats reserved for
employee representatives. Politicians, academics, insurance experts and
lawyers are optional extras.
At Volkswagen, almost 20 per cent owned by the Social Democrat Lower Saxony
government, the membership includes two senior SPD politicians and nine
representatives of employees and unions. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, former head of
the liberal Free Democrats, speaks for the DSW shareholders' association.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Mediators suspend Geneva peace talks
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday suspended peace talks on Bosnia for three
days, apparently to step up pressure on Bosnia's Moslem President Alija
Izetbegovic and his divided delegation.
They postponed the Geneva talks even after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic agreed to withdraw Serb forces from strategic heights overlooking
Sarajevo and to open two routes into the besieged city.
'We agreed to open the city of Sarajevo as soon as possible,' Mr Karadzic
told reporters in Pale, the mountain stronghold above Sarajevo.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the peace envoys, last night said
they would invite Mr Karadzic and his Croat counterpart, Mr Mate Boban, to
attend talks on Monday, said a spokesman.
The envoys are apparently reluctant to resume talks if Mr Izetbegovic and
his country's multi-ethnic presidency remain split.
They seem to be seeking assurance that the parties press forward with talks
on the republic's ethnic partition.
At the same time, they hoped to wait until Serb forces withdrew from key
heights, said Bosnian officials. Diplomats believe that Mr Izetbegovic is
holding out in the hopes of western intervention against Serb targets
besieging Sarajevo.
The chance for reviving the talks, stalled for four days, were raised when
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said his president would
return to the negotiating table if Serb forces withdrew as agreed from the
key heights above Sarajevo.
At the same time, it appeared unlikely that General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian
Serb commander, would immediately withdraw and hand over control of the
strategic points on Mounts Bjelasnica and Igman to United Nations peace
keepers.
Serb leaders said two routes running through Serb-held territory would be
opened for use by UN military, relief and commercial traffic.
One of the proposed routes would run north to Moslem-held Zenica, central
Bosnia, and the second route would run southwest to Mostar and the Adriatic
Sea.
However, it would operate at the mercy of Moslem adversaries, because it
cuts through territory held by Serbs and Croats.
Meanwhile Mr Abdul Satar, foreign minister of Pakistan, lashed out at
western moves to 'reward the aggressor'.
Roger Matthews adds from Washington: The US dilemma over its response to the
Bosnia conflict was again highlighted yesterday when Mr Marshall Freeman
Harris, senior State Department official responsible for monitoring the
crisis, resigned in protest at government policy. Mr Harris wrote in his
letter of resignation that he could not serve a government 'that accepts the
forcible dismemberment of a European state and will not act against genocide
and the Serbian officials who perpetrate it'.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Drop in asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of foreigners seeking asylum in Germany fell by a third in July,
the first full month since tough laws were introduced.
A total of 20,658 applied for asylum, 33.7 per cent fewer than the previous
month. The sharpest reductions came among nationals from Romania and
Bulgaria. Fewer applications were also recorded from former Yugoslav
republics other than Bosnia.
The fall is largely attributed to tougher asylum procedures which came in
force at the beginning of July. 'These number prove that the new law works,'
said Mr Erwin Teufel, premier of Baden-Wurttemberg and a member of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
But Mr Edmund Stoiber, premier of Bavaria, warned that problems remained
despite a drop in the number of applications. Mr Stoiber and other
conservative politicians have voiced concern that more would-be asylum
seekers are instead becoming illegal immigrants.
Under the stricter law, asylum seekers face new, faster procedures if they
come from a 'safe country of origin' which figures on a list adopted by
parliament. Authorities now have to decide on their case within 19 days
instead of the average of 12 months it took previously.
Moreover, border guards can turn back asylum seekers coming over the German
border if their case is deemed 'manifestedly unfounded'. The federal border
protection office said 1,100 asylum seekers had been turned back in July at
the German-Polish border on these grounds.
The fall in the number of asylum seekers came as Mr Klaus Kinkel, the Free
Democrat foreign minister, called on Germany to tackle the larger problem of
adopting an immigration policy.
The Free Democrats and opposition Social Democrats have long argued that a
solution to the growing number of asylum seekers, which peaked at 440,000
last year, should be followed by a policy defining the status of foreigners
coming to work in the country.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Mediators reluctant on restart of talks

THE FUTURE of the Bosnian peace talks in Geneva yesterday remained uncertain
despite a pledge by Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic to withdraw his
forces from strategic heights overlooking Sarajevo and to open two routes
into the besieged capital.
'We agreed to open the city of Sarajevo as soon as possible,' Mr Karadzic
told reporters in Pale, the mountain stronghold above Sarajevo.
International mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg last night had
not yet decided whether to recall Mr Karadzic and his Croat counterpart, Mr
Mate Boban, to attend peace talks today in Geneva, said a spokesman.
The peace envoys are apparently reluctant to resume the negotiations,
stalled for four days, if Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic refuses to
proceed with talks on the republic's ethnic partition. Diplomats believe
that Mr Izetbegovic is holding out in the hope of Western intervention
against Serb forces besieging Sarajevo.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said yesterday his president
would return to the negotiating table if Serb forces withdrew as Mr Karadzic
had announced from the key heights above Sarajevo.
However, it appeared unlikely that General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb
commander, would immediately withdraw and hand over control of the strategic
points on mounts Bjelasnica and Igman to UN peacekeepers.
Serb leaders said two routes running through Serb-held territory would be
opened for use by UN military, relief and commercial traffic. One of the
proposed routes would run north to Moslem-held Zenica, central Bosnia, and
the second would route would run southwest to Mostar and the Adriatic Sea.
Roger Matthews adds from Washington: The continuing US dilemma over its
response to the Bosnia conflict was again highlighted yesterday when the
senior State Department official responsible for monitoring the crisis
resigned in protest over government policy.
Mr Marshall Freeman Harris, the Bosnia desk officer, wrote in his letter of
resignation that he could not serve a government 'that accepts the forcible
dismemberment of a European state and will not act against genocide and the
Serbian officials who perpetrate it.'
At a meeting with top aides last Saturday President Bill Clinton approved a
plan for using air strikes to protect Bosnian Moslems. However, with
European allies reluctant to follow the US lead and Mr Clinton preoccupied
with domestic issues while Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, is in
the Middle East, the Bosnia issue has this week slipped down the
administration's immediate agenda.
Although Mr Harris was not a central figure in the formulation of US policy,
his resignation may help to reverse that process. A year ago Mr Harris's
predecessor resigned in similar circumstances.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Virgin steps up Sunday campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN, the British music and book retailer, yesterday raised the stakes in
its battle to open its French megastores on Sundays by threatening to cancel
its plans to expand in France.
'Our expansion plans, which would generate 1,000 jobs in five years through
the opening of 25 new stores, cannot go ahead as it would be impossible to
draw up a reliable budget estimate,' the group said. It estimates that its
megastore on the Champs Elysees, its main French outlet, generates 20 per
cent of its sales on Sundays.
Yesterday's statement is the latest volley in the company's battle over
Sunday trading in France. The battle has split the French government and set
Virgin's French employees against the country's trade unions, which oppose
reform of the 1906 Sunday trading law.
The costs facing Virgin have also risen sharply. Earlier this week, a Paris
court raised sharply, from FFr250,000 to FFr4m (Pounds 450,000), the fines
that will be imposed on Virgin if it ignores the ban on Sunday trading.
The company has opened its outlets for the past four Sundays in defiance of
a court ban and is appealing against the fines.
The case has split the French government. Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture
minister, said yesterday that Virgin should be granted an exception to the
Sunday trading ban because it provides access to cultural goods. But Mr
Michel Giraud, the labour minister, caught between a desire to safeguard
jobs and the court ruling, urged Virgin to obey the law.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Bosnian Serbs ready for the final assault: General's
campaign has been a mixture of brilliance and brutality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander whose forces have this week
been tightening their siege of Sarajevo, appears to be indulging his
uniquely macabre sense of humour.
In flagrant defiance of the UN ban on flights over Bosnia, the general tours
Serb positions in the hills around the battered capital in a Gazelle
helicopter.
Swaggering in his peaked world war one cap, he thumbs his nose at the
western countries' talk of air strikes against his forces, and boasts about
how he has saved up Sarajevo for last.
Gen Mladic, who has masterminded the Serbs' campaign to carve an 'ethnically
cleansed' mini-state out of Bosnia with a mixture of brilliance and
brutality, has consolidated control over strategic heights around the
Bosnian capital, with its 380,000 trapped inhabitants.
Serb guns, tanks, and soldiers have now cut off the last route used by the
mainly Moslem Bosnian army to smuggle ammunition, weapons and supplies to
their besieged city.
What, it must be asked, can he and his fellow Bosnian Serb leaders want?
After all, they already control 72 per cent of Bosnian territory, and the
mainly Moslem Bosnian government of President Alija Izetbegovic has all but
admitted defeat by bowing to the republic's ethnic partition.
Gen Mladic has never been ambiguous about his aim. He has publicly advocated
the 'total military defeat of the Moslems' as the only means of achieving
peace in Bosnia. If achieving that means securing the fall of Sarajevo, it
seems, then so be it. In that sense, the siege of the capital is the
centrepiece of Gen Mladic's military strategy.
The men who claim to be his political masters, however, have sometimes given
voice to different priorities.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, in particular, appears still to be in
a hurry to sign a peace agreement in the belief that it will prompt the
easing of sanctions on what remains of Yugoslavia.
In turn, he may be applying political pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serbs' political leader, to appear more pliant in the Geneva peace
negotiations.
Hence, perhaps, Mr Karadzic's announcement yesterday ordering Serb forces to
withdraw from key heights overlooking Sarajevo and open two roads leading to
the city - with the stated aim of forcing Mr Izetbegovic to abandon his
boycott of the talks.
Gen Mladic's reaction, at least for public consumption, was derision.
He scoffed to UN officers: 'Once the Serb flag is flying, we never take it
down. The UN flag can fly alongside but below the Serb flag.'
In reality, it is unlikely that Gen Mladic is totally at odds with Mr
Karadzic. Instead, the apparent split between them on this as on previous
occasions may be a convenient ruse aimed at sowing confusion among the
Serbs' western adversaries. Mr Karadzic himself has made no secret of the
fact that he, too, has designs on Sarajevo itself.
To back up their claims to at least part of the capital, Serb officials have
been circulating fictitious maps purporting to show that Serbs comprised a
majority in many city districts. The international mediators, Lord Owen and
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, appear to have been persuaded that Serbs have an
historical claim to part of Sarajevo.
Before the war, however, according to pre-war statistics collated by
municipal authorities, Moslems represented the biggest group in each
municipality,
But there are differences of emphasis at least between the Gen Mladic and Mr
Karadzic.
Gen Mladic is said to have been irked by Mr Karadzic's pledge in the Geneva
negotiations to hand over territory to the Moslems. According to diplomats,
Mr Karadzic has agreed that the proposed Moslem republic should cover 30 per
cent of Bosnian territory, as insisted on by the EC and UN mediators.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Madrid to cut Pta100bn in budget spending plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S minority Socialist government, hoping to restore confidence in the
country's recession-hit economy, yesterday announced it was cutting Pta100bn
(Pounds 480m) in planned spending from the 1993 budget and promised
'maximum' cuts in the 1994 budget, which is being drafted.
But the cuts for this year fell way below what analysts and the markets had
been hoping for. In less critical economic situations in 1991 and 1992 the
government found cuts of Pta341bn and Pta200bn in current spending. The
planned central government budget deficit this year of 2.4 per cent of GDP
is likely to be more than 5 per cent of GDP, the finance minister, Mr Pedro
Solbes, told an emergency session of parliament yesterday.
Spending is some Pta1,300bn over target, with tax revenues, hit by the
recession, falling short by Pta700bn.
Before yesterday's debate the cabinet had met until late in the night on
Wednesday to agree on the relatively timid cuts for this year, on the
establishment of a special corps of officials to combat tax evasion and a
sharp increase in the price of petrol.
Mr Solbes told parliament that most of the cuts would be taken by the public
works ministry.
Combatting public spending is likely to remain the key to the country's
ability to be able to bring down interest rates rapidly, despite to
increased leeway given the peseta by more flexible ERM rules. The Bank of
Spain is likely to remain vigorously opposed to anything but the most
orthodox approach to reviving economic growth.
In an effort to back up the government claims to be focussing its efforts on
bringing down inflation, Mr Solbes said he intended bringing back to
parliament draft legislation to make the Bank of Spain autonomous.
Passage of this legislation was interrupted by the spring election campaign.
He said he would also be reintroducing legislation to make public contracts
more transparent and to weaken the control professions have over the fees
they charge.
Mr Solbes said he believed that the recession had already hit bottom in
Spain and that the strength of the peseta, following the widening of the ERM
bands in which it is allowed to move was evidence of confidence in the
economy.
The wider bands would allow further interest rate cuts, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven economics professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
called last week for the end of the European exchange rate mechanism say the
decision to widen the currency fluctuation bands to 15 per cent was 'sound
and pragmatic'. In today's Financial Times, they write: 'The speculators
were the best friends of the unemployed . . . Rather than look back and
dream of punishing speculators, officials need now to exploit the new-found
freedom to fight unemployment . . . giving urgent priority to expansion.'

FT  06 AUG 93 / Clinton budget bill approved by House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's compromise budget bill cleared the first of its two
congressional hurdles early today when it was narrowly approved by the US
House of Representatives.
The battle now moves later today to the Senate, where the outcome is even
more finely balanced.
The House vote came after intense lobbying by Mr Clinton and a flood of
phone calls by voters trying to sway their congressmen on the controversial
bill.
Mr Clinton lobbied ceaselessly throughout yesterday to persuade congressmen
and senators from his own Democratic party to support the legislation, which
is seen as vital to the authority of his presidency.
He argued that the bill was critical for the health of the economy and to
show that president and Congress could work together.
Under the proposed legislation, the federal budget deficit will be reduced
by Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, raising Dollars
241bn in new revenue and cutting spending by Dollars 255bn.
Mr Clinton said that he had been spelling out what would happen in the
months ahead, assuming the bill was passed. 'This is the beginning, not the
end, of responsible budgeting,' he said. 'No one I have spoken to believes
seriously that a better result will occur if the bill does not pass.'
In one of the more emotional speeches yesterday, Congressman John Lewis from
Georgia urged his fellow Democrats to demonstrate 'courage, nothing but raw
courage'.
Republican members of both houses oppose the legislation and have
concentrated their attacks on the planned increases in income tax for the
highest-paid Americans and on the 4.3 cents a gallon increase in the federal
tax on petrol and diesel fuel.
Mr Bob Dole, Senate Republican leader, has described the tax increases as
the biggest in the history of the US.
But while attention centred on the House of Representatives' debate, there
was no let-up among Democrat leaders to secure at least one more vote in the
Senate. When the original bill came before the Senate in June it was tied at
49-49 and was only passed on the casting vote of vice-president Al Gore.
Because the House and Senate passed different versions of the measure, the
compromise bill was then worked out by Democratic leaders for this week's
crucial votes.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Rolls-Royce to close specialised titanium plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE is to close Europe's only supplier of a metal product essential
to the aerospace industry and buy it instead from Japanese and US suppliers.
Deeside Titanium, a Rolls-Royce subsidiary which makes titanium sponge
granules, would shut because demand was falling and imports were cheaper,
Rolls-Royce said yesterday.
It was opened only 11 years ago because the UK wanted its own source of a
material used in engines for both military and civil aircraft.
The plant, in Clywd, north Wales, has been operating at well below its
capacity.
Rolls-Royce said: 'The company has maintained operations to provide the
special quality of titanium which is needed to make the high temperature
alloys used in Rolls-Royce engines. It used to be a strategically important
source. Now there is the required quality from alternative sources.'
Deeside Titanium is near the site of Shotton steelworks where 8,000 jobs
were lost when steelmaking ended in 1979.
It was the first big project to be attracted to regenerate the area and was
seen as a flagship investment symbolising new metal for old. Titanium has an
exceptional strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance.
The plant, which will close before the end of this year, was set up at a
cost of Pounds 25m with backing by the then Labour government's National
Enterprise Board. The shareholders were Billiton UK, a Royal Dutch Shell
subsidiary, Imperial Metal Industries and Rolls-Royce. Subsequently
Rolls-Royce took a controlling interest of over 80 per cent with IMI
retaining the balance.
Today, the plant sells titanium granules to IMI which uses them to make
special alloys for Rolls-Royce aero engines. IMI sells any surplus alloy to
other aerospace companies in North America, while Rolls-Royce also had other
sources for the special alloys.
Demand for the granules never came up to expectations and the plant never
worked at full capacity, even when the aerospace industry was at its
strongest in the late 1980s. In the last two years the market has
deteriorated. Defence spending has been cut and orders for civilian aircraft
postponed. Titanium prices fell sharply as supplies were swollen by metal
from the former Soviet Union.
The price of aerospace grade titanium dropped from more than Dollars 10 a
kilogram in 1989 to Dollars 3.50 now. In response, Japanese and US companies
cut production by more than one third in 1991 alone.
Any investment for new factories was attracted to the US which has both the
world's largest aerospace industry and an import tariff on titanium products
of 15 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the EC.
A US-Japanese joint venture, with twice the capacity of Deeside Titanium,
opens this year in Ohio. IMI would test the quality of the new plant's
output as another possible alternative to Deeside, said Mr Peter Fisken,
chairman of IMI Titanium.
Deeside Titanium never employed more than 160 people. The present workforce
is only 73, whose redundancies will be phased over several months.
Clywd county council said yesterday the closure was of great concern. 'It
demonstrates again the fragility of our success in north-east Clywd,' it
said. 'There has been much new investment but there are problems once again
with job losses.' Last month, the area's assisted area status was downgraded
from full to intermediate.

FT  06 AUG 93 / France resists rate cut after sharp decline in reserves:
Belgium and Denmark strive to keep D-Mark link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of France yesterday continued to keep its short-term interest rates
high to support the franc in the reformed European exchange rate mechanism,
amid signs that recent intervention in currency markets had heavily depleted
its foreign exchange reserves.
While the French central bank kept its intervention rate, at which it lends
to commercial banks, unchanged at 6.75 per cent, it also ensured that the
cost of borrowing French francs for one day hovered around 12 per cent by
deciding not to cut short-term rates.
Figures released yesterday by the central bank indicate French
foreign-currency reserves fell by more than FFr100bn (Pounds 11bn) in the
week to the July 29 - one day before the franc fell to its old floor in the
ERM, prior to the stretching of the system's limits earlier this week.
The low level of French reserves may be one reason why the government is
maintaining relatively high interest rates to support the currency, in spite
of expectations that widening the ERM's currency margins would allow a quick
easing in borrowing conditions to help economic recovery.
France's policy yesterday coincided with that of Belgium and Denmark, both
of whose currencies have traditionally been closely tied to the D-Mark. The
two countries' central banks continued to ensure yesterday that their money
markets remained fairly illiquid, with the cost of borrowing their
currencies well into double figures for most of the day.
The approach of all three countries appears to be to keep their currencies
as close as possible to their old ERM floors as a way of maintaining a close
D-Mark tie and underlining some semblance of unity on pan-European currency
co-operation.
The heavy selling last week of the French franc and other weak currencies in
the system triggered the institution on Monday of 15 per cent bands against
the D-Mark for all currencies in the system apart from the guilder. These
margins replaced the 2.25 per cent bands for all the ERM currencies except
the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo which had 6 per cent bands.
Some economists in Paris and London said the large fall in French reserves -
a consequence of last week's large buying by European central banks of weak
currencies for D-Marks - would have left the country's net reserves at less
than FFr15bn.
Others suggested that France's reserves could now technically be negative,
because the figures would not take into account more sophisticated
intervention operations involving swaps and forward contracts in the
currency markets.
French economists said the low level of reserves meant the French
authorities had only the interest rate weapon as a means of supporting the
franc's exchange rate against the D-Mark.
In spite of the high interest rate policy, the franc fell back inside the
ERM yesterday following the announcement on reserves.
After opening in London at FFr3.4625 against the D-Mark, the French currency
fell nearly 2 centimes at one stage to a low of FFr3.4810. It later
recovered to close at FFr3.469, but eased in New York to FFr3.4725.

FT  06 AUG 93 / Gold price plummets in US as bullish mood evaporates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD lost 2 per cent of its value in five seconds of hectic trading on the
New York Commodity Exchange yesterday, falling from about Dollars 393 a troy
ounce to Dollars 384.
The previous bullish sentiment evaporated after reports that the Bank of
China had sold about 6 tonnes - or 193,000 ounces - in London early
yesterday. There was also selling by Arab and Swiss syndicates which made
the market very nervous, traders said.
Nervousness turned to a stampede as soon as trading started on Comex in New
York, as some investment funds sold as much gold as fast as they could,
triggering more selling by funds which use computer programmes to limit
their losses.
Gold's sudden and sharp fall dragged down other precious metals, as well as
sending gold company shares plummeting.
Gold steadied in the afternoon and closed in London at Dollars 388.25 an
ounce, down Dollars 13.25 from Wednesday's close.
There was renewed selling at midday on Comex, however, and the August
contract closed in New York at Dollars 377.2, down Dollars 22.
Gold has risen from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce in January.
Only six days ago, the US funds used the uncertainties created by what
appeared to be the virtual collapse of Europe's exchange rate mechanism to
push the price through the Dollars 400 an ounce level.
Some analysts suggested yesterday's fall was no more than a healthy
correction after a speedy price rise. If gold could climb back to Dollars
395, the bull market would remain intact, they argued.
Others were more cautious and pointed out that the US investment fund buying
which had propelled gold upward might be reversed.
Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch financial services group,
said: 'On the basis of underlying physical demand for gold, the price should
have topped out long ago and fallen back by at least Dollars 50 an ounce.'
He pointed to a 'collapse' in demand for physical gold in the crucially
important Asian and Middle Eastern markets, which accompanied the build-up
of options trading activity on Comex.
He added: 'We remain convinced that the huge gap between physical offtake
and the paper market can't last forever. One day paper market prices will
have to fall and fall sharply.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / New ministers to spearhead Cuban reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA'S government replaced four ministers yesterday in a shake-up of key
economic posts that signalled its determination to confront the island's
economic crisis with reforms, Reuter reports from Havana.
The ruling council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, named Mr
Alfredo Jordan Morales, Mr Nelson Torres Perez, General Silvano Colas
Sanchez and Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez Garca as the new ministers for
agriculture, sugar, communications and finance respectively.
It was the most important shake-up of economic posts on the Caribbean island
for several years.
Foreign diplomats said the changes confirmed President Castro's intention to
tackle the island's economic problems, aggravated this year by flagging food
production and a disastrous sugar harvest.
Mr Rodriguez, a leading economist, was previously deputy director of the
Centre for Research in the World Economy in Havana. Last week he told
foreign reporters he foresaw the introduction of monetary, tax and exchange
rate policies and limited market mechanisms to overhaul the economy.
The state media have indicated the government intends to depart from its
adherence to the former Soviet-style economic policies in force when Cuba
was a member of the Soviet trading bloc Comecon.
Mr Torres, who is to head the strategic sugar ministry, has earned a
reputation for efficiency in his previous post as Communist party chief in
the south-central province of Cienfuegos. He replaced Mr Juan Herrera
Machado, another veteran who had served seven years as sugar minister.
During Cuba's disastrous 1992-93 sugar harvest, output slumped to 4.2m
tonnes, one of the lowest levels ever. Reasons cited for the failure, which
cost Cuba Dollars 500m in lost sugar revenue, were unseasonably bad weather
as well as acute shortages of fuel, spare parts and fertilisers.
In the agriculture ministry, Mr Jordan also faces the challenge of reviving
flagging food production, a sensitive area for Cuba's nearly 11m people who
are suffering serious food shortages.
Mr Jordan was a provincial party chief in eastern Las Tunas province.
The new ministers will serve under Mr Carlos Lage, vice-president of the
council of state and recognised by most observers as Cuba's leading economic
strategist.
The appointment of Gen Colas as communications minister follows an existing
policy of putting military figures in infrastructure posts, such as
transport.

Shops and offices remained closed as hundreds of Kashmiris took to the
streets defying the curfew to protest against the killing of the family at
point-blank range in their home in Daribal-Khanyar, in Srinagar. At least 20
people have died since Sunday night, in police firing to quell the

LIBYA has invited the United Nations to open talks that could lead to the
eventual trial of the two alleged Lockerbie bombers, a UN spokesman
announced last night, writes Michael Littlejohns at the UN in New York.
However, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, needed further

of compensation, before sending a mission to Tripoli.
Mr Omar Mustafa al-Muntasser, the Libyan foreign minister, with whom he
discussed the question in New York late on Tuesday, has returned to Tripoli
to consult his government on the points raised.
The Security Council imposed sanctions against Libya last year after Tripoli
refused to hand over two men accused of masterminding the December 1988
bombing of a PanAm jet over Lockerbie in Scotland with the loss of 270
lives.

FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in traded options rocketed yesterday, leaving Footsie futures in
the shade, as one institution, optimistic for the stock market's future
prospects, carried out a number of bullish trades, writes Peter John.
Volume in the options sector of the Liffe topped 50,000 contracts, the
highest for some time, lifted by hefty put writing or selling. The writing
of a put, an option giving the right but not the obligation to sell stock at
a certain price and at a fixed time, is a more aggressive ploy than buying
calls. That is taking up the right to buy stock at a certain price. It makes
money immediately but has a high downside risk in the event of the
underlying share price falling.
The top traded options were BTR with 4,434 lots, the equivalent of nearly
4.5m shares, BT with 3,641 lots and Lasmo with 2,717 contracts. The Euro
Footsie option was also very active, with more than 8,500 contracts changing
hands.
Meanwhile, the Footsie future contract for September delivery was almost
dead in the water with only 5,760 contracts dealt. It was sharply lower for
most of the day, hitting 2,935, at which stage it was priced at a premium of
only 3 points above the cash market.
However, a late burst of activity sent it up to 2,952 by the official close,
near the high of the day and at a 10-point premium to cash, compared with a
fair value of 4.

FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Spirits alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a lively spirits sector, takeover talk again stalked Invergordon
Distillers and the shares climbed 9 to 279p. The focus, as always, was on
whether White and Mackay would attempt to return to the fray after its
failed bid for the group - in which it bid 275p a share - two years ago.
US-owned White and Mackay still holds a 41.3 per cent stake in Invergordon
and has never discounted rebidding. Analysts said the talk was likely to
intensify as Invergordon's results drew closer in early September.
There was also renewed talk that Highland Distilleries and IDV, Grand
Metropolitan's drinks division, would finally launch their much-rumoured
Pounds 100m bid for North British Distillery, an Edinburgh-based distiller
of grain whisky.
North British, an unquoted company with 600 shareholders, announced in May
that it had received a bid approach. However, in spite of plenty of
speculation there have been no further developments. Highland advanced 11 to
339p and GrandMet 3 to 416p.
Stores produced another mixed bag, with Boots turning in a strong
performance, buoyed by a positive note from SG Warburg. The shares jumped 15
to 474p in turnover of 4.8m. There was said to be some switching out of
Kingfisher, which has recently had a strong run on the back of French rate
cut hopes. The shares shed 9 to 637p. Goldman Sachs was rumoured to have
moved from 'buy' to 'hold'.
Talk of tough trading at Northern Food's agm saw the shares slip 4 1/2 to
264 1/2 p.
Second line food retailers tried some catching up. Shoprite Group moved
ahead 7 to 165p, Iceland 6 to 226p and Morrison 4 to 149p.
Chemicals group BOC improved ahead of third-quarter results due next
Tuesday. Hoare Govett is a buyer and forecasts profits of Pounds 260m,
against Pounds 250m for the same period last year. The shares appreciated 9
to 691p.
Reed International, whose interests range from legal and business
publications to consumer magazines and local and regional newspapers, took
up much of the stage in the quiet publishing sector yesterday as the market
cautiously awaited the group's interim results, due today.
These will be the first profits reported since the merger with Elsevier at
the beginning of the year. Only 620,000 shares were traded with the price
firming 3 to 664p on market expectations of pre-tax profits between Pounds
267m and Pounds 275m.
Analysts admitted that they were operating in the dark as no comparison
could be drawn against previous figures. But the combined group, which still
maintains separate stock exchange listings, has strengthened its presence in
Europe and increased its stake in such high margin areas as scientific
publishing through the merger. Hoare Govett said that the progress of the
merger and current trading conditions would prove the keys to movements in
the shares today.
United Newspapers, which has risen for two consecutive trading days, shed 3
to 551p on modest profit-taking and realisation that the overall interest
rate cuts in Europe might not come as soon as the market has been expecting.
News International continued to move forward, adding 6 at 238p, reflecting
the market's confidence in its newly purchased stake in the fast-growing
Asia.
In the printing sector, news of orders from the Daily Mirror for new
supplements helped Hunterprint Group appreciate 3 to 45p.
William Baird, the textile group, ended 3 higher at 266p.

FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hotels optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another busy day's turnover in hotel stocks was testimony to the current
debate among market analysts over the timing and rate of recovery in the
maligned sector. Kleinwort Benson, in its half-yearly review of the hotel
market, published yesterday, said enthusiasm for recovery prospects was now
overriding the suspicions engendered by the suspensions earlier this year of
Queens Moat Houses and Resort Hotels.
The securities house raised its forecast of room demand at UK hotels this
year to 8 per cent, although it admits that room yield is likely to be flat.
However, 1994 will bring room yield and trading profit per room up by 5 per
cent, Kleinwort believes.
Yesterday, Forte, tipped by a number of brokers as a prime beneficiary of
the sector's potential upturn, saw its shares improve 3 to 216p in brisk
turnover of 3.6m. Ladbroke again attracted attention because of its high
yield in the face of continued talk of UK base rate cuts. Dealers reported
switching between the stock and Forte. The shares ended a penny ahead at
198p after a volatile session which saw a hefty 8m traded.
There was also speculation in the market that the financial problems at
Queens Moat Houses, Britain's second biggest hotel group whose shares were
suspended in March, may be worse than earlier reports had suggested.
Industry sources say that initial estimates of shareholder funds show a fall
from Pounds 1bn to just Pounds 250m. One hotel analyst calculated that the
implications of this for shareholders would be a share price of under 10p.
The shares were suspended at 47p. There had been hopes that the group's
residual value pointed to a price above 20p.

FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hickson activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Realisation that one institution had sold a large stake in Hickson
International, the specialty chemicals group, came too late to affect the
share price significantly, but dealers said some 5 per cent of the company's
equity changed hands yesterday.
One institutional fund is believed to have disposed of its holding, and
after official dealing ended the Seaq electronic dealing system showed a
large number of block trades carried out at 204p a share and total turnover
of 11m shares.
The principal shareholders are Baring, Britannic Assurance, PDFM - the UBS
fund management arm - and Gartmore. The initial feeling was that PDFM had
sold its 5.6 per cent holding, but the fund said it had not been involved
and the finger later pointed to Gartmore, which in April was recorded as
holding 4.1 per cent of the issued equity. Hickson shares finished a penny
easier at 213p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good results from the Midland Bank arm of HSBC provided further evidence
that there was money to be made out of the turmoil within the European
exchange rate mechanism and sent HSBC shares higher on a generally listless
day. HSBC ordinary rose 19 to 690p, a record high, on turnover of 5m.
Analysts were taken aback by a half-year figure of Pounds 385m, against
Pounds 60m in the same period last year. The gain reflected a surge in
earnings from Midland's treasury and dealing arm Midland Global Markets, one
of London's leading foreign exchange players. There was also a big rise in
debt securities, suggesting that the bank had hedged itself succesfully
against falling interest rates.
Analysts raised end of year forecasts for HSBC to between Pounds 2.4bn and
Pounds 2.9bn for the year-end. Mr John Aitken, banking analyst with UBS,
said that, while fundamental doubts over the bank remained, the bank's
dealing side had done very well. Although he remained a seller he lifted his
estimate by Pounds 400m to Pounds 2.6bn.

SEEMINGLY good traffic figures for July from British Airways failed to
impress the market and the shares fell back 6 to 339p. Hefty turnover of 22m
included one block of 8m dealt at 343 3/4 p. Transport analysts said they
were worried by the load factor, which showed a year-on-year decline of 2.1
per cent. 'The trend is worrying,' said one specialist, 'and has serious
implications for group revenues.'
BA said its growth in traffic of 11.5 per cent was the largest monthly rise
this financial year and, together with a 15 per cent rise in the same period
last year, represents a 25 per cent traffic increase in the past two years.

FT  05 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Losses cut back towards the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER cut in repurchase rates by the Bundesbank steadied nerves in the UK
stock market yesterday, but not enough to extend the nine-day bull run in
the FT-SE 100 Index. After falling sharply in early trading, the index made
a strong recovery later to close only 3.7 points off at 2,941.3. London
brushed off the fall of 4 Dow points in early trading in New York.
The calmer performance in currency markets following the interest rate move
in Germany appeared to underline the equity market view that, while rates
will fall in Europe, the pace of such moves will be kept under control; UK
rates may not move until the autumn, say analysts.
Trading volume remained fairly high and the recovery from the early loss of
14.2 on the Footsie featured the interest rate-related stocks which have led
the latest advance in equities. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued to power
ahead, closing 11 points up at a peak of 3,349.4. Business in non-Footsie
stocks further increased, making up about 66 per cent of the day's total.
Retail, or customer, volume in equities jumped to Pounds 1.7bn on Tuesday
and yesterday's Seaq-recorded business of 735.8m shares compared with just
over 800m in the previous session.
However, turnover levels were affected yesterday by the completion of the
Pounds 100m programme enacted on Tuesday by UBS. Traders commented that
equity dealing was fairly quiet until UBS began to unravel some of the
positions involved in the trading programme.
London-based securities houses remained optimistic and showered the market
with advice as to which stocks to buy for recovery or on which to take
profits. The banking sector, sensitive to this week's flow of trading
figures from the big names, was encouraged by a substantial increase in
first-half profits at Midland Bank, now part of HSBC.
Dealers said there was some signs that US investors might be returning to
the pharmaceutical sector which they have been selling so heavily this year.
However, yesterday's buyers could not be convincingly tracked down to
transatlantic sources - unless they were acting via some Scottish funds.
There was a late run in some oil issues following suggestions from some
industry analysts that crude oil prices could respond in third and fourth
quarters of the year to the economic strengthening of the leading industrial
nations. The stress fell on some of the oil exploration groups which are
seen as leading any rebound, rather than on the blue chip shares which are
seen as more closely tied to Wall Streeet's prospects.
But the evident slackening of strains in the ERM prompted profit-taking in
some of the retail and consumer stocks which have been leading the charge in
London. Kingfisher, favoured because of its French Darty interests, turned
downwards and Marks and Spencer and GUS gave ground, although the latter
continued to attract buy recommendations from sector analysts.
Overall, equity strategists in London remained convinced that 'rate cuts
favour European equities', to quote Mr John Reynolds at NatWest Securities.
He advises remaining overweight in European financial markets, with the UK
favoured, together with France and Spain.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Nafta talks weigh on Mexican equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO, after an easier midession showing, finished on a brighter note as
investors awaited the start of talks in Washington on the North American
Free Trade Agreement. The market index registered a rise on the day of 27.67
at 1,804.72.
Helping to depress initial sentiment was an early fall in Telefonos de
Mexico, the telephone group, of 1 per cent, following a decline in its ADRs
in the US.
BRAZILIAN stocks advanced 2.5 per cent in early trading on bargain hunting
following falls in the last few days. But by the close the Bovespa index had
more than lost the rise and was down 1.1 per cent on balance at 61,820.
The market has been sensitive recently regarding talks between President
Itamar Franco and congress over wages policy. Trading is likely to remain
thin ahead of the options and futures market settlements later this month.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks cautious awaiting
budget vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARES finished on a slightly easier note after cautious trading
yesterday as markets awaited the Congressional vote on President Clinton's
first budget package, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.22 at 3,552.05,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.73 off at 448.54. Secondary stocks,
however, fared much better, and the Nasdaq composite gained 4.78 at 713.79,
a record high. Trading volume on the New York SE was 230m shares.
Trading was subdued from the start, and stocks struggled to find a
direction. All eyes were on Washington DC, where President Clinton and his
supporters were making final efforts to ensure that his deficit-reduction
budget is passed by Congress this week.
The President and leading Democrats have predicted confidently that the
budget will be approved, but they expect the vote to be close. Both stock
and bond markets are of the same view, and passage of the budget has been
cautiously priced into values.
However, if the budget falls at the final hurdle (and one senior Democrat
senator warned yesterday that he still had misgivings about the package),
investors fear that bond prices could fall sharply, triggering a big
sell-off in the equities markets. It was this fear that kept many investors
on the sidelines yesterday.
Kmart, languishing near its 52-week low recently, rallied Dollars 1 to
Dollars 21 5/8 in volume of 5.2m shares after the large retailer confirmed
reports that it is looking for a buyer for its Pay Less drugstore operation.
Computer issues were busy. Hewlett-Packard dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars
71 in active trading after brokerage house Smith Barney Shearson lowered its
rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral'. Elsewhere in the sector, prices
were mostly firmer, IBM adding Dollars 1 at Dollars 44 3/8 , Motorola
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 96 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 at Dollars 37
1/2 .
A broker's recommendation lifted Sears Roebuck Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 3/4
in a volume of 1.5m shares.
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 30
1/4 as the stock continued to benefit from the company's recently announced
price cuts across its products range. Chiron fell Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars
65 as worries about the group's recently disappointing earnings continued to
plague the stock.
Quadrex lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 4 3/4 after the nuclear power plant
servicing company posted a second-quarter loss of 59 cents a share and said
it might sell its environmental unit.
Canada
THE Toronto market extended its rising trend to seven consecutive sessions
with a small gain in relatively light trading. The TSE 300 index closed 12
points higher at 3,988.5 and advances held an edge over declines by 356 to
348. Volume amounted to 43.6m shares valued at CDollars 509.8m.
The real estate sector, however, dropped 5.26 per cent, while the gold and
silver index fell 3 per cent in reflection of a decline in gold bullion
prices.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms ahead of
new government taking office
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE activity dominated trading as most investors remained inactive
ahead of the swearing in of the new coalition government today, and share
prices firmed in tandem with the futures market, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 139.91 up at 20,497.55. The index fell to the
day's low of 20,298.93 on a decline in the futures prices shortly after the
opening; but later rose to a high of 20,667.87 in the afternoon session.
Volume increased to 300m shares from 269m. Arbitrageurs led trading, while
some financial institutions were seen shuffling portfolios. Gains led
declines by 569 to 397, with 195 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks added 14.42 at 1,671.64, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index edged up 0.22 to 1,269.44.
The futures market firmed on hopes of fiscal and monetary support for an
early economic recovery. Mr Jason James at James Capel said a more unstable
government suggested the higher possibility of income tax cuts, since more
elections would increase the importance of the ordinary voter.
Meanwhile, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life yesterday released a report assessing the
level of shares in cross-shareholdings. It said that 44 per cent of total
listed shares were held by stable shareholders. Taking this figure into
account, Dai-Ichi reckons that the average price-earnings ratio for Japanese
shares averages around 17 per cent.
Banks gained on hopes of lower interest rates. Industrial Bank of Japan
advanced Y100 to Y3,490 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y50 to Y2,440.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt advances to set high
for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses showed mixed fortunes yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT finished at a year's high, although activity petered out late in
the session, and continued through into after hour's trading.
The DAX index, which had earlier reached 1,880.15, ended 17.13 higher at
1,860.56. Turnover was DM10bn.
While banks and insurers remained firm favourites, Deutsche up DM12.50 at
DM766 and Commerzbank adding DM3.50 to DM323, analysts at BHF bank in
Frankfurt suggested that now is the time to take profits and switch into the
construction sector. They said that construction stocks, which had
underperformed the market recently, would benefit from lower interest rates,
while improving prospects in east Germany suggested that the slowdown in
public construction orders in the west would not hurt earnings too much.
In the sector Bilfinger &amp; Berger was up DM14 at DM919, Hochtief DM26 at
DM1,115 and Holzmann DM6 at DM965.
Elsewhere, Volkswagen, which has called an extraordinary meeting tomorrow to
discuss its dispute with Opel, firmed DM6 at DM361.50.
PARIS eased further after a day's high of 2,126 in the CAC-40 index, as
investors continued to indulge in profit-taking. The index closed off 9.22
at 2,101.36.
However, turnover remained good in the holiday month at FFr4.5bn.
Roussel-Uclaf surprised most analysts with better than expected first half
results and the shares added FFr25 or 4.5 per cent to FFr584.
In the opposite direction Rhone-Poulenc lost FFr6.00 or 4 per cent to
FFr153.50 after reiterating expectations of lower 1993 profits.
AMSTERDAM looked at Akzo's second quarter results, which were much in line
with expectations, and marked the shares up 10 cents at Fl 170, but off the
day's high of Fl 172.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.1 to 122.8.
ZURICH saw an early rally run out of steam as demand dried up and the SMI
index finished 0.2 higher at 2,430.7, a second consecutive all-time high
close, but sharply down from the day's peak of 2,449.2.
Cyclicals continued to attract strong interest, while recently neglected
insurers also remained in favour with Zurich Insurance SFr16 higher at
SFr1,249 and Winterthur SFr17 ahead at 695.
MILAN found continued demand for cement and telecommunications issues which
kept the Comit index, up 5.33 at 581.84, at a high for the year.
Italcementi rose L439 to L10,086 and Unicem rose L500 to L8,400 in continued
reaction to the government's price liberalisation moves.
Sip gained L84 to L3,184 in very heavy volume of 24.6m shares and Sirti was
L134 ahead at L9,925 on further US buying and some demand by domestic funds,
keen not to miss out.
MADRID fell prey to light profit-taking in response to the weaker dollar and
the general index dipped 0.51 to 270.60 in shrinking volume.
Repsol, the oil company, rose Pta45 to Pta3,505 after announcing a 6.3 per
cent rise in group first half, after tax profit.
BRUSSELS eased as interest rate uncertainties and profit-taking ahead of
today's settlement of the forward market account left the Bel-20 index 11.02
lower at 1,331.44 in heavy turnover of BFr1.48bn.
Delhaize, the retailer, fell BFr36 or 2.7 per cent to BFr1,290 in response
to a Dollars 16.2m settlement of labour law violations by its US Food Lion
unit.
ATHENS succumbed to profit-taking after Tuesday's high for the year and the
general index gave up 6.87 to 878.04.

FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investors take another look at
Bombay - Michael Morgan assesses the performance of the world's emerging
markets last week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A resurgence of investor enthusiasm in Bombay, after Mr Narashimha Rao, the
prime minister, unexpectedly survived last week's confidence vote, took the
market sharply ahead and contributed to a 1.9 per cent advance in dollar
terms in the Asian regional index of emerging markets.
The data, supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank, also shows that
Thailand and Manila rose strongly over the week, while Venezuela was firmly
down.
The broadly-based National market index has almost halved in value over the
last 15 months amid political worries and the continuing repercussions of
the 1992 Mehta banking scandal. In spite of last week's gain it remains some
15 per cent down in dollar terms on the year so far.
Overseas interest has grown steadily since the market was opened to foreign
investors last October, largely from new investment funds which have
overcome stringent government restrictions on investments by outsiders. The
latest of three to be launched in the last two months has raised Dollars
100m, mostly from UK investors. Economic growth is at 4 1/2 per cent this
year, inflation having been halved over the last two years to 6 per cent;
and there is a more liberal political regime since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, with which the Indian government had maintained ties.
Mr Spence notes that the market, which trades on a p/e of around 22 times
prospective earnings, is still expensive by international standards; but he
says that much of foreign interest is confined to medium-sized companies
with a p/e of around 10 times.
Bangkok rose as individual investors, comprising the majority of the
market's trade, decided that the charts looked positive. Construction,
banking and finance stocks were actively bought.
Analysts say the economy has been underpinned by falling interest rates, and
while investors are resigned to lower corporate profits this year, they are
looking for an improvement in 1994.
Manila was also firm, the composite stock index climbing to a succession of
record highs.
Mr Anton Periquet of Asia Equity in London comments that market sentiment
has improved in recent weeks, as expectations have grown of an earnings
recovery now that power shortages, which have beset the country in recent
months, appear to have been resolved. The market has also taken a lead from
strong demand by UK investors for PLDT shares traded in the US.

THE Russian government will sell shares in three state-owned oil-related
companies on August 18 in its first public privatisation offer in the oil
sector, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Dmitry Skorduli, head of the
All-Russian Co-ordination Centre for Voucher Auctions, said 8.3 per cent of
the shares would be offered at auctions to be held simultaneously around the
country. Subscriptions will remain open for two weeks. Foreigners with
Moscow offices will find it easier to buy shares than non-residents as the
latter are still not allowed to hold rouble bank accounts and are unable to
transfer funds to pay for shares from abroad.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Money Markets: DM38.1bn drained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank again announced a slight easing in the cost of lending funds
to commercial banks yesterday by cutting its 28-day repo rate to 7.60 per
cent, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's move pushed the 28-day repo below the discount rate level of
7.65 per cent, but came as no great surprise to dealers.
Call money has continued to be very low in the German money market following
the vast injection of D-Marks in last Friday's intervention to support the
French franc. The Bundesbank has therefore had to reduce the cost of lending
take control of the market.
The German central bank yesterday withdrew 38.1bn of those D-Marks in its
weekly money market intervention. But that did not stop call money staying
below the repo level, at around 6.65 per cent.
One sign of how easy conditions were was that some repo bids came in at 6.50
per cent.
Yesterday's moves make it quite possible that the Bundesbank will reduce its
discount rate at its next council meeting after the summer recess, because
call money is unlikely to rise much above that official rate floor.
But dealers said a discount rate cut would have little effect and expected
it to be preceded by an unchanged fixed rate repo. French franc interest
rate futures fell back sharply as France's policy of keeping the overnight
rate of lending very tight continued to make dealers think twice about the
future path of official rates.
France, Belgium and Denmark continued to keep their money markets tight in
the immediate aftermath of the relaxation of the European exchange rate
mechanism at the weekend. September French franc futures retreated sharply
as a result, dropping 24 basis points to close at 93.67.
In sterling markets, rate cut speculation was depressed again by France's
attempt to keep the cost of overnight borrowing very high. The September
short sterling contract declined 7 basis points to finish at 94.26 and the
December contract was unchanged at 94.66.
Three-month money was unaltered at 5 13/16 per cent, in spite of a large
shortage of Pounds 1.65bn in the discount market. Dealers were unhappy to
offer bills amid some excitement over interest rate cuts. The overnight rate
of lending was around 6 per cent for much of the day.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sharp rise for French franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone all rose sharply against
the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as the central banks of all three
countries surprised currency dealers by keeping the overnight cost of
borrowing very high, writes James Blitz.
The rush out of D-Marks into these other currencies may have been partly due
to the Bundesbank's decision to cut its repo rates on Tuesday and yesterday.
But many dealers were clearly taken completely by surprise by the decision
of the three countries not to cut interest rates and, instead, to sustain
their currencies and sting the speculators.
'There are a lot of people here and among our customers who do not know what
is going on,' said one commercial bank salesman yesterday.
The French franc was up more than 5 centimes, or 1 1/2 per cent, to the
D-Mark at one stage, peaking at FFr3.4500, near to its old exchange rate
mechanism floor of FFr3.4305.
It later receded to end at FFr3.466. The sharp rise was helped by an
overnight lending rate of almost 12 per cent.
There was little sign of the French authorities restoring the liquidity to
the money market that is needed after the withdrawal of so many French
francs last week.
The Belgian franc actually re-entered its old ERM bands against the D-Mark,
peaking at BFr20.78 and finishing at BFr20.95. The Belgian central bank said
it had dropped liquidity levels in its money market rate, and overnight
money was at 15 per cent.
The Danish krone also came close to re-entering its old bands, reaching
DKr3.9305 to the D-Mark in the US, compared to an old floor of DKr3.9015.
The Danish one-month money rate stayed at 25 per cent, with the overnight
cost of lending a good deal higher.
There was no official statement suggesting that there had been any policy
co-ordination between these three central banks. But several analysts said
the policies were being co-ordinated with the intention of showing that
these currencies would not diverge too far from their old ERM parities.
Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank, also suggested that the
central banks were out to teach speculators the lesson that free floating
currencies can go up as well as down.
A few dealers said they had heard of institutions losing money on the speed
of the French franc move. One influential head of foreign exchange said net
market losses in the last two days may have been substantial.
The D-Mark's decline in the ERM helped to push the dollar up in European
trading. The US currency gained some  1/2 pfennig to close at DM1.7105. It
also edged up against the yen to end at Y104.80 from a previous Y104.40. The
pound profited in this environment, rising  1/4 pfennig to DM2.5675. In New
York the dollar finished at DM1.7068 and Y104.82.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mossgas gets severe evaluation
in auditor's report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOSSGAS, South Africa's controversial R12bn (Pounds 1.77bn) synthetic fuel
project, is unlikely to produce any real returns and an estimate of its gas
reserves gives it a lifespan of only 10 to 14 years, according to a Deloitte
and Touche report, commissioned by Mr Henry Kluever, the auditor general.
Less than two years ago the project's lifespan was put at 25 years.
Mossgas has been a bone of contention since the cabinet gave the provisional
go-ahead for its construction, near Mossel Bay on the southern Cape coast,
in February 1987. It was a strategic decision that sought to enhance South
Africa's liquid fuel self-sufficiency in the face of an oil embargo against
the country.
Taxpayers have long resented the costs of a project that has a spectacularly
inefficient cost/output ratio compared with industry norms. This latest
report is likely to prompt renewed calls for it to be abandoned.
Mr Kluever said he considered the R11bn historical cost of the project,
before capitalised interest, to be a sunk cost. The investigation then
focused on projected cashflows from 1993.
On a best scenario basis, the project is expected to be cash positive from
1994 until further capital expenditure is required around the turn of the
century.
The estimate assumes the project will receive its revenue on an import
parity basis, not the export parity basis it is currently receiving.
The import parity price, received by Sasol, the other synthetic fuel
producer in South Africa, is the base price at which fuel in the country is
sold.
The export parity price, which is about 8-10 cents a litre less, is the
price the local oil industry receives for its exported product.
Mossgas had always assumed its product would be priced on the same basis as
Sasol's, but this is being resisted by local oil companies, who wish to
renegotiate the terms on which they take products from the synthetic
producers.
The report concluded that if the sunk costs were excluded from an analysis,
Mossgas had a future on an import parity basis. It added that the project
was sensitive to relatively small external changes, such as the price
received for its product determining overall revenue.
Mr Kluever said that Mossgas's potential had in fact deteriorated since last
being discussed by the parliamentary joint committee on public accounts in
December 1991.
Based on the best estimate scenario 'it is unlikely that Mossgas will be
able to fully service and repay the Central Energy Fund's foreign commercial
commitments relating to Mossgas'.
In spite of the report's damning conclusions, Mr Kluever said economic
viability of the project should continue given other social and economic
benefits that attached to its operation.
These included savings of foreign exchange, job creation and general
stimulation of economic activity.
The public accounts committee was to discuss Mossgas's position later this
week.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Confusion over CVRD sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS APPEAR nonplussed by the most recent volley in what is becoming a
Ping-Pong game of official comments on the possible privatisation of
Brazilian mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world's
biggest iron ore exporter.
'There have been lots of rumours about Vale's privatisation, but none of
them have been confirmed,' said one analyst.
A high ranking official in Brazil's finance ministry stated last week that
CVRD, which is 51 per cent government-owned, would be sold before President
Itamar Franco's term is completed at the end of 1994.
CVRD preferential shares were among the biggest losers on the Sao Paulo
Stock Exchange last week, falling by 2.2 per cent - 5.3 per cent in relation
to the exchange's Ibovespa index.
The government owns 51 per cent of CVRD's total equity and 66 per cent of
its ordinary shares. This allows much greater participation in the
management decisions and oversight.
Despite an apparently unequivocal statement by Mr Clovis Barros Carvalho,
executive secretary of the finance ministry, another ministry official said:
'The official position should come out at the end of September. The rest is
just talk.' Other high ranking Brazilian officials have made statements in
favour and against CVRD's privatisation in recent weeks. In the meantime the
company remains off the formal list of state companies for sale.
Mr Francisco Gros, former Central Bank president, said: 'I'm not very
encouraged by statements that we're going to sell Vale do Rio Doce. That's
for external consumption. We are going to have lots of statements in favour
of privatisation that are going to be contradicted by the facts.'
The only clear signal on the government's position was made by former
finance minister Mr Eliseu Resende, who included CVRD in his personal
privatisation plans before being replaced by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso in
May.
Since March, with speculation of an impending sell off, CVRD shares have
gained 30 per cent in dollar terms. Foreign interest, symbolised in a
bullish recent report by London's Latinvest, appears strong despite
constitutional restrictions on majority foreign ownership in Brazilian
mining operations.
Mr Anastacio Ubaldino Fernandes Filho, CVRD director-vice president, said
company executives had set up an internal commission to look at possible
privatisation. 'We are just being prepared. Nothing is formalised,' he
stressed.
Mr Juarez Fontana dos Santos, director of development for Paulo Abib
Engenharia, a mining consultancy, said opposition to a sell-off was strong
in President Franco's mineral rich home state of Minas Gerais.
Mr dos Santos, who favours privatisation, said an outcry was expected from
many who question why the majority shareholder should sell a profitable
company.
He said the privatisation debate might lead to the dismantling of the
company, despite non-mining operations like rail transport and shipping
being increasingly important for CVRD's revenues.
'Vale do Rio Doce is competitive precisely because of its synergies,' he
said. Piecemeal sales of subsidiaries 'would cripple the company'.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine output fall clouds value
of eastern Germany's Laubag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET value of Laubag, eastern Germany's largest lignite or brown coal
fields, will be influenced by the continuing fall in mining production in
the region, energy experts said yesterday.
Mining output in eastern Germany, including potash, fell by 9 per cent in
May, compared with the previous month, and by 15 per cent for April and May,
compared with the same period in 1992.
These figures, released earlier this week by the federal economics ministry,
suggested the fall in energy consumption in eastern Germany had not yet
bottomed out - energy consumption in eastern Germany fell 12 per cent in
1990 and a further 26 per cent in 1991. The decline, caused by the collapse
of eastern German industry, which has caused a sharp fall in energy
consumption, coincided with efforts by the Treuhand, the privatisation
agency for eastern Germany, to sell Laubag, which is in Brandenburg.
A consortium, headed by Rheinbraun, the brown coal division of RWE Energie,
and which included PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, western Germany's largest
utilities, was negotiating with the Treuhand to buy the fields.
But the negotiations stalled over the Treuhand's efforts to secure
guaranteed long-term annual coal delivery contracts of 57m tonnes.
Utility officials said yesterday that the consortium instead wanted 'short
contracts, perhaps only about three years initially, because we have no idea
at what volume energy consumption will start increasing in eastern Germany
over the next 20 years'.
Estimates of the value of Laubag, which has an annual production of 65m-70m
tonnes, range from DM1bn-DM2bn.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Franc rally averts 'green'
currency realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RALLY in the value of the French franc yesterday averted the
widely-expected need for immediate realignment of the 'green' currency rates
used to translate the European Community's guaranteed farm prices into
national currencies.
But farm trade experts warned that the past week's upheavals in the Exchange
Rate Mechanism could give a new lease of life to the green currency system.
'That's bad news for European agriculture reform,' one said.
Experts were tentative yesterday about the likely implications for farm
trade of the speculative assault on the ERM over the past week. Much will
depend on whether Monday's decision by European Community finance ministers
to widen the fluctuation bands of all member currencies to 15 per cent
succeeds in restoring currency stability.
Signs were more encouraging last night than at any point in the past week as
weaker ERM currencies made a sharp recovery as profit-taking on short
positions lifted the French franc against the D-Mark. 'Trading risks have
increased since the ERM collapsed but there's no reason to change agrimoney
rules,' said one EC official.
Grain trading in Europe was paralysed at one stage this week because of
uncertainty about farm prices. This will be one of the main items at a
special meeting of European commissioners tomorrow.
The impact on the EC budget is expected to be minimal, though national
governments may face higher budget costs in their national currencies as
their contributions - denominated in Ecu - rise in line with any
devaluation.
For UK farmers, it may spell the end of what one British farm spokesman
called a 'golden period'. Since the devaluation of sterling on September 16
last year, support prices to farmers have risen by about 20 per cent in
sterling terms and enhanced competitiveness against farmers elsewhere in
Europe has produced significant, but so far unquantified, export gains -
particularly for sheep meat.
The procedures for adjusting green prices in line with currency fluctuations
are likely to be more complex to manage. But EC officials said there was no
reason to believe the system put in place in January last year to deal with
the EC's five 'floating currencies' - sterling, the peseta, the escudo, the
drachma and the lira - could not work now it applied to all 12 EC
currencies.
Adjustments will be made whenever needed in response to several triggers:
Under a '10-day rule', under which each month is divided into three 10-day
periods, any currency shift greater than 2 per cent from the central ERM
rate during the last period of the month would result in the gap that opened
up having to be halved.
In parallel, any gap of more than 4 per cent appearing in a 10-day period
between any two individual currencies would also trigger adjustment by one
or both currencies.
Under a 'three-day rule', any gap of 6 per cent or more appearing over a
three-day period would trigger action to close the gap on the fourth day.
Yesterday was the first occasion on which a revision might have been needed
under this rule, but as the franc rallied, gaps closed to less than 6 per
cent. This rule applies on a rolling basis, so fluctuations will be
calculated daily and adjustments made as needed.
At a national level, farm trade analysts predicted that French farm and food
products would be likely to gain a competitive advantage on the German
market as a result of any depreciation of the franc against the mark. Last
year, Germany was France's main farm product and food market, importing
Fr32.7bn worth of goods. Italy was just behind at Fr30.4bn.

After an encouraging opening day to the new selling season last week, prices
barely held steady, and ended only a fraction higher than at the close of
the 1992/93 season. This week has seen the market slip further, despite
reduced offerings in Melbourne due to a strike of laboratory technicians.
The resumed easier tendency, after some improvement in the previous three
months, is not helpful to business in related markets. The Australian market
indicator on August 4 was 439c/kg, down 16 cents compared with a week ago.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Democrats to delay sale of
dairy boosting hormone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG THE hundreds of provisions in the Democrat budget plan is a measure
promoted by Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, to delay the
sale of dairy output boosting hormone bovine somatotropin (BST) to US dairy
farmers.
The measure would ban the sale of BST for 90 days, if, as expected, the
synthetic hormone gets the blessings of the Food and Drug Administration
this year.
The entry of BST on to the market is expected to cost the US government
Dollars 15m in payments to dairy farmers, resulting from an over-supply of
milk.
An aide to the senator said the US Agriculture Department would, during the
90-day ban, conduct a study about the economic effects of BST. This would
give the senator time to find 'a legislative solution'.
The BST provision infuriated Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican,
in whose state is the headquarters of Monsanto, the group which has spent
Dollars 500m developing the product.
'This is a matter of principle in that it conveys such a very loud and clear
message to America's scientific community,' he said. 'What it says to the
scientific community is don't invest, don't play by the rules, because in
the end the politicians are lurking and the politicians will get you.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO JOINT ventures headed by Kennecott, US subsidiary of the UK's RTZ mining
group, have reported encouraging drilling results at diamond properties in
Canada's Northwest Territories.
Mr Chris Jennings, president of SouthernEra Resources, one of Kennecott's
partners, said yesterday that the results from four kimberlite pipes were
'equivalent to or even much better than many producing mines'.
SouthernEra and the other junior partners hope Kennecott will help finance a
bulk sampling programme, which would involve the extraction of at least
5,000 tonnes of ore from the claim sites. A SouthernEra official said the
programme would cost about CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m)
The latest drilling results cover two claim blocks, known as DHK and WO,
located south-west of the Lac de Gras area, where another consortium led by
Australia's BHP has reported a significant diamond discovery.
One drill hole on the WO block produced 42 macro-diamonds and 134
micro-diamonds from a sample of 125.3kg of ore. All the macro-diamonds are
bigger than 0.5mm in diameter.
The Kennecott and BHP groups are among a large number of companies that have
staked claims across a vast area of the Northwest Territories in the hope of
a large diamond find. De Beers, the South African group, also has interests
in the area, but has not disclosed the results of its work or its
intentions.

The GOLD price scrambled back above Dollars 400 a troy ounce yesterday
afternoon as renewed speculative buying in the US partially countered heavy
sales in the morning, attributed to producers, professionals and the Chinese
central bank. At the London close the price, which had dipped to Dollars
399, was quoted at Dollars 401.50 a troy ounce. The PLATINUM market remained
firm throughout the day, supported by news that wage talks at South Africa's
Impala mine were going to mediation. At London's afternoon fix the price
reached a 31-month high of Dollars 419 an ounce, up Dollars 1.60. London
Metal Exchange base metal prices were led higher by copper, aluminium alone
defying the trend. COPPER absorbed early liquidation and moved ahead after
August option declarations passed without any surprises and Chinese buying
emerged. At the close the three months quotation was Dollars 1,949.25 a
tonne, up Dollars 3. Three months ALUMINIUM'S Dollars 4.75 fall to Dollars
1,236.50 a tonne, was blamed on disappointment at the failure to materialise
of an expected US production cut announcement. An early rise in LEAD
triggered stop-loss buying and the price closed Dollars 7 up at Dollars
411.75.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures rise as frost is
forecast in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON coffee futures market reached higher climbs yesterday, driven by
reports of a cold front heading towards southern crop-growing areas of
Brazil, the world's largest producer.
Prices for robusta coffee futures, which had hit 2 1/2 -year highs on
Monday, moved quickly into still higher ground. The November contract peaked
at Dollars 1,138 a tonne in the morning, the highest level since trading in
the dollar contract began in March 1991.
'It shows you what a real frost scare can do,' said one analyst. 'This is
the biggest one we've seen in the past three to four years.'
London initially followed an overnight rise in arabica futures in New York
but eased back to close at Dollars 1,125 a tonne, up Dollars 38. New York's
December arabica contract reached 82.70 cents a lb yesterday before dropping
to 80.70 cents, down 1.00 in late trading.
Traders focused on a report from the National Meteorological Institute in
Brasilia that frost was expected to affect Parana and Sao Paolo states early
next week.
Parana accounts for under 10 per cent of the country's coffee and Sao Paolo
some 15 per cent. The meteorologists told Reuters news agency it was
doubtful the cold would spread to the main coffee-growing areas of Minas
Gerais state, which, according to researchers at London broker ED &amp; F. Man,
is expected to produce 10.5m of Brazil's forecast 23m bags this year.
A slight frost hit parts of Parana last weekend, but damage to coffee trees
appeared to have been limited although the market is still awaiting details.
Buying interest from roasters was reported, as the coffee trade took
increasingly seriously the possibility that supplies will be restricted from
October 1, when Latin American producers are due to start retaining as much
as 20 per cent of their exports.
Price rises were partly self-fuelling, as market-makers covered positions as
the August 17 expiry of September call (buying) options approached.

GERMAN government bonds made further headway yesterday, prompted mainly by
hopes that the Bundesbank would cut its key discount rate towards the end of
the month, although the success of the latest 10-year bund auction provided
an additional tonic.
Hopes of a Bundesbank easing were fuelled by the central bank's allocation
of 14-day and 28-day securities repurchase agreements, with the market
taking cheer from the minimum rate of 6.7 per cent on the 28-day tranche.
This is below both the 14-day rate of 6.8 per cent and the discount rate,
currently at 6.75 per cent.
'The 28-day rate of 6.7 per cent attracted a lot of attention, and created
the expectation of a discount rate cut of between 75 to 100 basis points on
August 26 (when the Bundesbank council returns from holiday),' said Mr
Julian Callow, European bond and currency analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
Meanwhile, dealers said the new 6.5 per cent 10-year bund issue was
well-received. The average price at the auction was 100.52 and the average
yield was 6.43 per cent.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, the recent bond market frothiness appeared to have
subsided.
French government bonds ended lower ahead of today's auction of 10-year and
30-year stock. The main talking point remains the question of when the
Banque de France will see fit to cut interest rates.
The September 10-year futures contract ended 0.18 lower at 121.76, while the
10-year OAT yield ended 1 basis point above the bund yield, compared with 2
basis points through the bund yield the previous day.
The high-yielding government bond markets, which have rallied strongly since
the weekend agreement to move to wider fluctuation bands in the European
exchange rate mechanism, ran out of steam yesterday and gave up some of
their early gains.
UK government bonds fell back on profit-taking with short-dated issues
weakening as the much-wanted interest rate cut failed to materialise.
THE RECENT rally in Japanese government bonds took a breather yesterday as
the yen receded slightly against the US dollar. Dealers reported
profit-taking as the dollar strengthened to just over Y105. The September
JGB futures contract, which opened at 111.39, reached a high of 111.49 and
then fell to close at 111.15.
PROFIT-TAKING following Tuesday's big gains and concerns about the passage
of President Bill Clinton's budget depressed prices at the long end of the
US bond market yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/32 at
107 15/32 , yielding 6.548 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 4.151 per cent.
After Tuesday's solid advance in long-dated securities, an advance which
temporarily pushed yields to new record lows, investors took the opportunity
yesterday to book some profits in early trading.
Prices were also under pressure from reports that a key Democrat senator was
leaning towards voting against Mr Clinton's budget package. The passage of
the budget hangs in the balance, and the loss of support of a few Democrats
could scuttle its chances of approval.
In the morning many participants stayed on the sidelines until the afternoon
release of the quarterly refunding announcement. When the Treasury unveiled
its refunding programme, however, there was little reaction from the market.
Its make-up was in line with expectations.
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) has
suspended the December 1993 delivery month of its Spanish government bond
futures contract, pending a review of the contract.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Philippine institutions set
to issue more debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE state institutions are increasingly turning to the international
bond markets as the government continues to struggle with serious fiscal
shortages.
There are fears that the queue may lead to a bunching of maturities that
could again result in payments difficulties for the country, which is just
recovering from a 1983 moratorium on foreign debt repayments caused by a
severe financial crisis.
Following the national government's successful Eurobond offer of Dollars
150m last February, the Philippines' first since the 1983 crisis, several
state-owned corporations have lined up to issue Eurobonds.
However, early this year, Mr Christopher Brown, the IMF resident
representative in Manila, pointed out to Philippine officials the dangers of
acquiring too much new debt too soon after the government had announced
plans to finance infrastructure projects with its Eurobond proceeds.
Philippine officials say the IMF is taking a critical view of these
relatively short-term borrowings particularly because they are intended for
lengthy programmes.
National Power Corporation (Napocor), plans to use the proceeds of its bond
for a capital increase. The Development Bank of the Philippines, however,
will use its borrowings for loan programmes for the private sector.
The IMF's criticism could also affect the Philippines' lengthy negotiations
with the fund for an economic recovery programme.
The Philippines is seeking an Dollars 800m three-year financing under the
IMF's extended fund facility, but the negotiations have dragged on due to
doubts over the government's ability to raise sufficient revenue.
The talks are planned to resume in September, but newly-released government
data do not appear reassuring. Government revenue collections in the first
half of the year were 10 per cent of the target.

UK MERCHANT banks have won a further substantial stake in Italy's
privatisation plans with the announcement of valuers and co-ordinators for
some of the most important deals in the disposal programme.
Schroders and Fox Pitt Kelton are to value Ina, the life insurance group, in
which the government hopes to float an opening stake early next year.
Schroders has already carved out a strong position in transactions in the
financial services sector, while Fox Pitt Kelton is a specialist in
insurance.
Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank which earlier valued the big Crediop
long-term lending group, has been appointed to value the Enel electricity
generating authority. Timing will depend on new laws changing the company's
monopoly and the tariff structure.
The treasury announced that four leading Italian banks would act as global
co-ordinators for the Ina flotation, along with Goldman Sachs. It also
confirmed the job of co-ordinating the sale of shares in the IMI financial
services group would be done by IMI itself and SG Warburg. A valuer for IMI
will be appointed by the end of this month.
Responsibility for appointing banks to value and manage the privatisations
of several other public sector groups has been devolved to their mangements,
which will have to reach a decision by September 15. The list includes Banca
Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two of Italy's biggest banks, the
Stet telecommunications holding company and the Agip oil group.

sharply in wake of agreement

<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTED resched-uling agreement reached by Russia and western creditor
banks has triggered a sharp increase in price and trading volume on the
secondary market for Russian debt, debt traders said yesterday.
The price has risen from 28 cents to the dollar before the London Club
agreement was announced in a circular by the banks' advisory committee last
Friday to 33 cents on Monday and 41 to 42 cents yesterday.
Mr Peter Bartlett, a trader in east European debt at Morgan Grenfell in
London, said his bank, which makes a market in the debt, had on Tuesday
alone conducted 30 transactions averaging Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m each.
He said the main buying had come from North and Latin American investors who
had made big profits on Latin American debts and who were looking for
another 'very exciting rollercoaster LDC ride'.
Bankers said the market had not expected an agreement so soon given the
impression that of chaos prevails within Russia and that Russia might try to
drag out the rescheduling talks.
Under the provisional deal reached by Mr Andrei Vavilov, the deputy finance
minister, in Frankfurt last week, Russia has agreed to pay Dollars 500m in
three tranches in the last quarter of 1993. Repayment of another Dollars 3bn
of interest owed this year will be postponed for five years. Russia's latest
estimate of its commercial bank debt is Dollars 24bn.
Repayment details have yet to be agreed with creditors, however, and there
is no guarantee the government will deliver when the time comes.
Possible explanations for Russia's rush to conclude an agreement range from
national pride to a desire by the reformist finance ministry to assert
Russia's credibility when domestic political chaos has been aggravated by
the central bank's botched monetary reform.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for sterling
mortgage-backed offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST offering this year of sterling bonds backed by performing
mortgages met strong demand yesterday, fuelled by the shortage of paper in
the sector.
The Pounds 140m issue of floating-rate notes was backed by National Home
Loans mortgages. In March, National Home Loans, the troubled UK mortgage
lender, launched a Pounds 105m issue of securities backed by non-performing
mortgages.
The new issue is backed by Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m of mortgages from NHL's
balance sheet, with the rest taken from existing pools following the
refinancing of two existing mortgage-backed deals.
Mr Nigel Terrington, NHL's finance director, said the mortgage book was now
down to less than Pounds 250m, which is financed by NHL's banks, following a
rescue package last year. The company will continue to run down its mortgage
book. It is also reviewing whether to resume lending and a decision is
expected by December, Mr Terrington said.
The latest deal pays interest at 50 basis points above Libor, which
represents a discounted margin of 52 basis points over Libor, in line with
secondary market levels, according to lead manager SG Warburg.
The deal was quoted at 100.05, above its fixed reoffer price of 99.93.
Also in the sterling sector, Denmark was yesterday taking proposals from
banks for a three to five-year bond offering totalling up to Pounds 1bn,
dealers said.
In the Canadian dollar sector, three four-year deals totalling CDollars 425m
were all priced over the three-year Canadian government bond yield, giving
an artificial boost to their yield spreads.
Both SNCF and GECC launched four-year deals priced to yield 45 basis points
over the three-year benchmark. Dealers said this represents around 20 basis
points over the interpolated yield curve.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Gencor unveils unbundling
details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, yesterday unveiled
details of its proposed unbundling which will leave it larger than
originally anticipated.
It will also have a residual 20 per cent holding in the consumer industrial
group Malbak, which is being spun off.
When Gencor made its initial announcement in May, it said it would be
unbundling all its non-mining assets, after which its net asset value could
be as low as R10bn. Yesterday's announcement said net assets would be
R14.1bn (Dollars 4.2bn).
Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, stressed that the central aim - to
leave the unbundled Gencor with the critical mass necessary to be a
successful international resource company - had been achieved. He also noted
that Malbak would in future be a portfolio investment, not a managed one as
in the past. He would step down from the Malbak board.
The unbundled Gencor's larger size came primarily from an appreciation in
its mining assets, especially gold and platinum, since the earlier
announcement. Gencor had also, as previously announced, collected about
R1.6bn in cash and portfolio investments since then.
Mr Gilbertson said about 30 per cent of the new Gencor's net assets would be
in cash and other realisable investments. 'This is an exceptionally healthy
position for a mining group ahead of a possible upturn in metal markets.'
But there were no immediate spending plans.
Negotiations to buy most of Billiton, the Royal Dutch/Shell mining and
metals arm, were 'on course'. Prospects of this deal being consummated had
improved 'but it is by no means a certainty'.

Otto Eckart, a German potato products producer, for an undisclosed sum.
Pfanni makes a range of potato-based goods - ranging from dehydrated mashed
potatoes to fresh-packaged and frozen products. The company has three plants
in Germany and one in Poland, and annual sales stand at about Dollars 220m.
Some of the products are also exported to the US, where they are sold under

CPC said yesterday it saw considerable scope for extending the Pfanni brand,
and expected to develop the business 'aggressively'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, a subsidiary of Anglo American Industrial
Corporation, increased first-half attributable earnings by 21 per cent from
R31m to R37.6m (Dollars 11.2m) after benefiting from a R10m deferred tax
adjustment.
Operating profit, however, fell to R34.07m from R35.9m a year earlier
despite a 6 per cent increase in turnover to R737.4m, reflecting the
difficult market conditions.
The interim dividend was maintained at 20 cents a share on a 21 per cent
improvement in earnings per share to 42.5 cents, from 35.1 cents a year ago.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said an end to inventory corrections by steel
stockists and new projects had helped local steel sales increase by nearly
10 per cent over the same period in 1992.
Mr Boyd predicted that firmer dollar prices for export steel and ferro-alloy
products, and a weaker rand, should allow a 'moderate' increase in
second-half earnings over the first six months.
The vanadium market, however, continues to be difficult. Prices have fallen
to a level last seen during the recessionary period of 1982-83.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bronfmans to cede control of
Trizec in debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TORONTO'S Bronfman family will relinquish control of Trizec, North America's
biggest publicly-traded real estate developer, under a debt-restructuring
plan unveiled by the Calgary-based company.
The proposals, covering CDollars 1.9bn of Trizec's CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars
4.14bn) debt, involve the conversion of at least half the parent company's
senior debentures, as well as junior debt and preferred shares, into common
equity.
The recapitalisation plan would reduce debt by CDollars 859m and cut
debt-servicing costs by CDollars 130m a year.
The number of common shares outstanding would more than quadruple to 930m
shares, leaving existing shareholders with a stake of only 23 per cent.
Carena Developments, the Bronfman holding company which owns 53 per cent of
Trizec, would end up with about 12 per cent.
Senior debenture holders would own 49 per cent of the shares, while 16 per
cent would be in the hands of junior debt holders.
Holders of senior debentures, over half of which are held in Europe, would
convert part of their holdings into a new 10-year security with an 8 per
cent interest rate.
Trizec could later convert the new debentures into common shares as well if
the North American real estate market deteriorates further. But Mr Kevin
Benson, chairman, said yesterday that 'we really want to repay that
debenture to preserve equity for the common shareholder'.
The company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange once the
restructuring is complete. The existing two classes of common shares would
be combined into one.
Mr Benson said he hoped to reach agreements with the senior and junior debt
holders within the next six weeks. Trizec is seeking the concessions because
of its expected inability to meet CDollars 980m in debt repayments which
fall due over the next three years. With real estate financing in the
doldrums, the prospects are slim for raising new equity or refinancing
existing debt. The attractions of selling assets have also diminished.
Trizec's class B shares tumbled by 51 cents in Toronto yesterday to close at
CDollars 1.05, against a 1990 peak of CDollars 30.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing starts to crack the
whip at Husky Oil - Management changes have brought a mood of optimism at
the Calgary group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX years and several hundred million dollars of losses after his first
foray into the North American energy industry, Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong
billionaire, has quietly begun cracking the whip at Calgary's Husky Oil.
His determination to improve Husky's performance was signalled clearly last
month with the typically low-key replacement of Husky's Canadian chief
executive by an expatriate parachuted into the senior management ranks 18
months earlier from Hong Kong.
The new chief executive, Mr John Lau, has worked for the Li group for 10
years and is described by a former colleague as a 'fixer'.
Mr Lau says 'there won't be substantial differences' under his stewardship.
But the mere fact the former chief executive, Mr Arthur Price, has been
moved at the age of 41 to become a 'special adviser' to another Li company
suggests a new era is dawning at Husky.
Mr Lau has already made an impression as a decisive executive, spearheading
the latest of several cost-cutting exercises. His authority is reinforced by
the presence of Mrs PC Koh, who was also brought in from Hong Kong last year
as vice-president in charge of, among other things, strategic planning.
'Certainly, there are going to be changes,' says one person with an intimate
knowledge of the company. He predicts a 'battening-down of the hatches' and
a sweeping reorganisation which may include the disposal of Husky's offshore
interests in Libya, Indonesia and Vietnam.
The volatile North American oil and gas industry has been a big headache for
Mr Li. Over the past two years, Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong
conglomerate controlled by Mr Li, has taken write-offs totalling HKDollars
2.2bn (USDollars 283.9m) on its 49 per cent stake in Husky.
But Mr Li has so far shown no sign of backing away from his investment. On
the contrary, various family-controlled companies have raised their original
52 per cent stake, bought in 1987, to 95 per cent in 1991. This includes
Hutchison Whampoa's stake. The remaining 5 per cent is owned by Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce. Li companies have subsequently poured several
hundred million dollars of new equity into Husky.
Mr Price, who still works out of Husky's head office, insists there is no
intention for the time being of joining the stampede among Canadian energy
companies to tap the equity markets for funds.
Mr Ian Doig, publisher of an oil industry newsletter in Calgary, says Mr Li
'got taken to the cleaners' with his initial CDollars 484m (USDollars 378m)
investment in Husky.
But based on the price Husky received for various oil and gas properties
which it sold recently, Mr Doig says that Mr Li 'is starting to recover some
of his initial losses.'
Such upbeat comments reflect a widespread impression that, while Husky's
problems are by no means over, its fortunes are more likely to improve than
deteriorate over the next few years.
Husky declines to reveal any sales or earnings figures, but a look at its
businesses suggests its shareholders will be getting both good and bad news
this year. Husky has benefited from a surge in North American natural gas
prices. But these gains are at least partly offset by the depressed sulphur
market, caused by worldwide over-supply. Husky is one of Canada's biggest
sulphur producers.
The news is also mixed from the newly-commissioned Lloydminster heavy oil
upgrader on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. The upgrader's construction and
financing have pre-occupied Husky for almost a decade. Husky has a 27 per
cent stake in the CDollars 1.6bn project, which processes tar-like heavy oil
into 46,000 barrels a day of synthetic light crude.
From a technical point of view, the long-delayed upgrader is performing
splendidly, but the narrowing price differential between heavy and light
crude oil has severely eroded its financial performance.
Husky and its partners - the Alberta, Saskatchewan and federal governments -
were hoping for a gap averaging CDollars 8 to CDollars 9 a barrel. But
strong demand for heavy oil coupled with the sliding price of light crude
has squeezed margins, narrowing the spread to less than CDollars 5.
The damage to Husky will be limited, provided the depressed margins do not
last too long. The company has long had a reputation as one of the Canadian
oil industry's most politically influential players.
The upgrader deal obliges the government shareholders to absorb the bulk of
any losses in the early years of operation, or to hand over to Husky more
than its proportionate share of profits. However, one of Husky's partners
also expresses concern about the upgrader's longer-term economics, saying
that price forecasts made in the early days of construction in 1988 may no
longer be realistic.
Optimism about Husky's future is based largely on its decision several years
ago to focus on natural gas and heavy oil. It withdrew from light-crude
exploration in 1987, and has consolidated its remaining oil and gas
properties, in the process raising about CDollars 600m from asset disposals.
Much of its exploration and development effort is now concentrated in the
Rockies foothills, west of Calgary. Mr Price claims Husky's gas properties
are 'about the best in the business' measured by quality of reserves and
development costs.
Mr Lau and Mr Price refuse to comment on rumours that Husky's drills have
struck a vast reservoir in the foothills. But they do predict that the
benefits of work being done now will show up in the company's financial
performance over the next three to five years.
Perhaps the most telling sign that Mr Li's investment may at last be paying
off is the recent acquisition by several other prominent Hong Kong
entrepreneurs of Westcoast Petroleum, another western Canadian oil and gas
producer.
Outsiders suspect these investors would not have made their move without a
quiet word from Mr Li that things were starting to look up in Calgary.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Tax adjustment boosts Highveld
Steel returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, a subsidiary of Anglo American Industrial
Corporation, increased first-half attributable earnings by 21 per cent from
R31m to R37.6m (Dollars 11.2m) after benefiting from a R10m deferred tax
adjustment.
Operating profit, however, fell to R34.07m from R35.9m despite a 6 per cent
increase in turnover to R737.4m, reflecting the difficult market conditions.
The interim dividend was maintained at 20 cents a share on a 21 per cent
increase in earnings per share to 42.5 cents, from 35.1 cents.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said an end to inventory corrections by steel
stockists and new projects had helped local steel sales increase by nearly
10 per cent over the same period in 1992.
Although world steel consumption is forecast to fall this year, prices
continue to improve, and all of Highveld's ironmaking furnaces were brought
back into production.
Mr Boyd predicted that firmer dollar prices for export steel and ferro-alloy
products, and a weaker rand, should allow a 'moderate' increase in
second-half earnings over the first six months.
The vanadium market, however, continues to be difficult. Prices have fallen
to a level last seen during the recessionary period of 1982-83.
This is the result of lower consumption, exacerbated by the entry of Russian
producers at costs 'unrelated to western costs'. Highveld, the world's
largest vanadium producer, has closed its Vantra vanadium pentoxide plant.
It is unlikely to open again before the fourth quarter.
The Rand Carbide and Transalloys divisions continued to operate below
capacity, though the outlook is now more positive, while sales at the Rheem
division were lower than in 1992.

<TEXT>
SPRINT, the third-largest long-distance carrier in the US, is linking with
Toronto-based Call-Net Enterprises, and acquiring a 25 per cent equity stake
in the Canadian telecommunications group. Sprint suggested yesterday the
deal's value stood at more than CDollars 160m (USDollars 125m).
The alliance is aimed at giving Sprint increased access to the long-distance
telephone market in Canada, while Call-Net will have access to Sprint's
technical capabilities.
Under the 10-year deal, Call-Net will issue about 3.1m non-voting shares to
Sprint, giving the US company a 25 per cent equity interest.
Call-Net will then pay royalties equal to the lesser of 2 per cent of future
incremental Call-Net revenue or pre-tax earnings. These royalty payments
cannot exceed CDollars 10m for the first three years, or CDollars 15m a year
after that.
The value of the equity stake is put at around CDollars 60m, while the
royalty portion of the agreement is reckoned to be worth over CDollars 100m
over the 10-year period.
Sprint will also obtain three board seats - on an expanded nine-man board -
as part of the transaction.
Call-Net, which started operations in 1986 and expects revenues of around
CDollars 200m in 1993, also announced plans yesterday to raise a further
CDollars 100m via the issue of new shares. Sprint will take up its
proportionate share of the issue.
The Canadian company plans to use the money for computer and switching
equipment, for the installation of further fibre-optic transmission
facilities, the deployment of Sprint-based technology and for working
capital.
Call-Net is the second-largest long-distance carrier in the markets which it
serves - Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia - and the fourth-largest in
Canada overall.
It serves around 17,000 customers in 16 metropolitan centres. Earlier this
year, it acquired the Canadian long-distance telephone business of Cable &amp;
Wireless for around CDollars 35m - an operation which encompassed about
7,000 customers, mostly small and mid-sized businesses.

<TEXT>
CORNING Inc, the US high-technology group, yesterday said it would take an
after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 25m to Dollars 50m in the third
quarter related to its acquisition of Damon Corporation, a US medical
testing laboratory.
Corning said the Damon transaction would be slightly dilutive to earnings
per share for the next 12 months.
The company plans to issue about Dollars 200m of long-term debt and about
Dollars 400m of common stock in the second half of this year to finance the
Damon transaction. Corning completed its tender offer for Damon yesterday.
Corning also plans to increase its registered debt securities to Dollars
500m from Dollars 50m and has filed a shelf registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
In June, Corning made an unsolicited bid of Dollars 370m for Damon in a move
to strengthen its position in the clinical laboratory sector. The
acquisition will help Corning compete with SmithKline Beecham for leadership
of the sector.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, has filed with the SEC for a shelf
offering of up to Dollars 1bn of debt securities. The company said it would
use the proceeds for general purposes.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Kmart considers sale of PayLess
Northwest unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KMART, the Michigan-based retailer, said yesterday it was considering the
sale of its PayLess Drug Stores Northwest subsidiary.
PayLess comprises 560 drug store outlets in a dozen states, mainly in the
west of the US. Its sales last year reached Dollars 2.3bn, and operating
profits stood at Dollars 113m.
Kmart gave no indication of how far any potential sale process had gone, and
its chairman, Mr Joseph Antonini, said that he could not predict the outcome
'at this time'.
The retailer has been struggling in the face of an increasing difficult
market for the discount store operators, and its Pace warehouse club chain
has faced significant problems.
In June, Kmart warned that after-tax profits for the current year would be
unlikely to match 1992's Dollars 941m, and its shares have been bumping
around their 52-week lows in recent weeks.
This summer, Kmart indicated it might spin off or sell some of its
specialist retail interests - although yesterday's announcement is the first
time that the group has specifically named a division which might be up for
sale.
Kmart is best-known for its mainline discount stores, but also incorporates
specialised retail businesses. Aside from PayLess and the Pace club outlets,
Kmart takes in Builders Square, Waldenbooks, The Sports Authority, OfficeMax
and Borders - selling goods ranging from books to sportswear.

183m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL Reinsurance, the largest US reinsurer, recorded second-quarter net
income of Dollars 183.8m, or Dollars 2.14 a share, up from Dollars 158.5m,
or Dollars 1.80, a year ago.
The growth in General Re's earnings stemmed from lower claims and expenses,
an improvement in the company's underwriting results, and a modest rise in
investment income. The strong second quarter took the Connecticut-based
reinsurer's six-month earnings to Dollars 344.4m, down from the Dollars
366.3m recorded in the first half of 1992.
Last year's six-monthly results, however, were boosted by a one-off gain of
Dollars 61m from an accounting adjustment.
General Re's worldwide net premium volume in the quarter climbed 3.2 per
cent to Dollars 588.4m, due primarily to a 42 per cent jump in international
reinsurance premium volume. Net investment income totalled Dollars 193.8m
over the three months, up from Dollars 187.9m a year ago.
Total revenues reached Dollars 843.4m, up from Dollars 829.2m in the second
quarter of 1992.
Claims and claim expenses totalled Dollars 397.4m, compared with Dollars
427.8m a year ago, and overall expenses shrank by 3.3 per cent to Dollars
608.4m.

It said 'there is no improvement yet in sight' and that a continuation of

The company in May said it was 'guardedly optimistic' that a positive 1993
result was possible. Swissair is expected to release first-half earnings
figures on Friday.
The company said its load capacity improved in June, to 63.8 from 62.2 per
cent in the same month a year ago. Demand rose 7 per cent against last time,
while capacity increased 5 per cent.
Traffic rose 5 per cent in Europe, and 6 per cent on intercontinental
flights. Traffic on flights to Latin America, the Middle East and southern
Europe, was flat or fell.

CIMENTS Francais, the French cement group, said first-half 1993 revenues
fell 13 per cent, to FFr6.59bn (Dollars 1.1bn) compared with the first half
of 1992, Reuter reports from Paris.
It said the decline was due in part to falls in certain currency rates
against the franc, and the overall economic slowdown in France. Foreign
exchange fluctuations accounted for a FFr119m drop in revenues.
On a comparable and constant exchange-rate basis, revenues would have fallen
7.4 per cent. The company expects the decline in revenues for the second
half to be less than the first.
The biggest declines in revenue were in France and Belgium, at FFr3.97bn,
down 10 per cent.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Murdoch to fund Star deal with
ADollars 500m share placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation plans to raise about ADollars 500m
(Dollars 347m) through an issue of convertible preference shares to help pay
for the acquisition of a 63.6 per cent stake in Star TV, the Hong Kong-based
satellite TV company.
News Corp is issuing 25m convertible shares at ADollars 20 each. The
placement, which is underwritten, will also provide working capital for the
media group.
The shares will pay an annual dividend of 6.25 per cent, payable every six
months until mandatory conversion on April 30 1998. The new class of shares
will require a change in the company's articles of association. An
extraordinary meeting has been called for September 3.
News of the financing came as Mr Julian Mounter, chief executive of the
company which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries, confirmed he would not be
staying on to work for the Murdoch-controlled company.
The resignation of Mr Mounter, who previously ran the New Zealand
Broadcasting Corporation, comes despite efforts by Mr Sam Chisholm, chief
executive of British Sky Broadcasting, to persuade him to change his mind.
Mr Chisholm flew to Hong Kong for talks with Mr Mounter as word of his
intentions spread.
The talks, which went on until midnight on Tuesday, failed to convince Mr
Mounter to stay on as chief executive, or even as a consultant.
It is not yet clear who will run Star or what the role of Mr Chisholm will
be. He is thought likely to remain in London in charge of BSkyB, a
consortium in which Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, has a stake.
Pearson failed in its attempt to get an acceptable deal to take control of
Star.
News Corporation also issued a statement yesterday replying to criticisms by
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, of the growing influence
of western media in the region.
News Corp said the company was conscious of the Asian way of life and its
unique cultural, historical and religious heritage.
'We intend to make Star TV a service which Asian families can enjoy in their
homes and a service which governments in the region will find both friendly
and useful,' it said.

FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Inheriting an unwieldy empire -
Haig Simonian assesses the legacy of the Gardini conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT just 24, Ivan Gardini, the son of Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian
entrepreneur who commited suicide last month, suddenly finds himself at the
helm of a ill-fitting industrial empire with sales of about L3,000bn
(Dollars 1.9bn) and debts estimated at almost half that figure.
It is not Ivan's first experience guiding a big company. In November 1990,
his father arranged that his son replaced him as chairman of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the quoted holding company controlled by the Ferruzzi
family into which Mr Gardini married.
The period spent at Ferfin by Ivan, just 21 at the time and better-known for
his passion for basketball than business, was brief. Within weeks of the
Gardinis' June 1991 'divorce' from the Ferruzzis, he was deposed from Ferfin
in favour of his uncle Arturo, and the Gardinis and Ferruzzis went their
separate ways.
Armed with the L505bn paid by the Ferruzzis to his wife Idina for her 23 per
cent stake in the Serafino Ferruzzi holding company, Mr Raul Gardini began
building a new industrial empire. After his unexpected death, and this
week's court action by Ferruzzi's new bosses to sequester up to L500bn in
assets, it may be up for grabs.
The new Gardini concern was being built on agricultural products,
commodities trading and branded food and drinks - much the same pillars as
those on which Ferruzzi expanded after Mr Gardini took management control
following the death of its founder, Serafino Ferruzzi, in 1979.
Like Ferruzzi, its growth has been surprisingly fast. Leveraging the pay-off
for his wife's Serafino Ferruzzi shares, and using privileged contacts in
foods and commodities, the indefatigable Mr Gardini was able to assemble his
new interests breathtakingly fast.
The dependence on borrowing and existence of established business links may
explain why much of his group was based on partnerships. None more so than
with Mr Jean Marc Vernes, the French industrialist who created the
Beghin-Say sugar group, now controlled by Ferfin, and a sizeable business
empire in France.
The link with Mr Vernes is one of the Gardini group's main assets. Mr Raul
Gardini's 'come-back' began with the purchase in September 1991 of a stake,
now up to 36 per cent cent, in Societe Centrale d'Investissement, the
cash-rich French concern controlled by Mr Vernes.
SCI is in turn the 80 per cent shareholder in Gardini et Associes (GEA), the
investment group which Mr Gardini used to spearhead his first acquisitions.
Again, he chose his partners carefully. Archer Daniel Midland, the US
agri-business group, Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK and CIP, a Luxemboug-based
holding company which controls large starch interests in Europe, took 5 per
cent each, while Mr Raul Gardini retained 5 per cent directly.
The takeover trail began in December 1991, with a 16.6 per cent stake in
Sucres et Denrees (Sucden), the debt-laden French commodity trader. Mr Raul
Gardini also bought controlling stakes in three industrial units from
Sucden: Barry, its cocoa bean processing arm and the world market leader;
and Vital and Sogeviandes, France's largest meant trading and processing
companies.
Emboldened by his successes, Mr Gardini soon reversed his vow not to do
business in Italy. To lead his Italian acquisition drive, he formed Garma,
another partnership, this time with Mr Giulio Malgara, the former European
chief of Quaker Oats,
Garma, 84 per cent-owned by the Gardini group, started life with L200bn in
capital. Although its first potential deal, to buy the Quaker Oats edible
oils business, was unsuccessful, Garma soon struck again.
In July 1992, it paid about Dollars 300m for the parent company of the
popular Levissima mineral water brand. Shortly after came the purchase of
four smaller brands. Together, the purchases gave Garma about 20 per cent of
the Italian mineral water market - Europe's biggest. In February, Garma
expanded in foods with 35 per cent of a new joint venture, creating Italy's
third-biggest frozen foods group.
Mr Raul Gardini also showed he had not lost his flair for spectacular stock
market raids. In October 1992, the Milan bourse was convulsed with rumours
that he was set to launch a takeover, eventually aborted, for the SME foods
group, having secretly built up a significant minority stake.
The intention, according to analysts, was to force the then-Amato government
to sell the state's controlling interest to the raiders, who would have
broken up the company and kept only those parts that fitted in with their
new empire.
Such financial acrobatics will be far from the thoughts of Ivan Gardini,
appointed chairman last week, and Mr Roberto Michetti, a former Ferruzzi
executive who is managing director.
Mr Raul Gardini may have hoped to give his empire greater coherence through
further takeovers, which could eventually have created one of Europe's
biggest foods and commodities concerns. It is up to his son and Mr Michetti
to ensure that the ill-fitting edifice constructed by its founder does not
come tumbling down on his heirs.

AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, reported a 30 per cent decline in

results.
In the second quarter, net profit fell to Fl 152m (Dollars 78m) from Fl
218.3m, on turnover down 4 per cent at Fl 4.13bn. The decline was due partly
to extraordinary charges of Fl 28m earmarked for restructuring programmes,
mainly in the fibre sector. If extraordinary items are excluded, net profit
declined 17 per cent.
Pharmaceuticals was the only division to report a small increase in
operating profit. Chemicals, coating and fibres all posted profit declines.
Mr Syb Bergsma, board member, said Akzo would be put at a short-term
disadvantage by the effective abandonment of the European exchange rate
mechanism. In the first half, turnover was depressed by Fl 100m because of
last autumn's declines in the value of the pound, the lira and the peseta.

SALES and profits at Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the Austrian building
materials group, recovered modestly in in the first half. Losses in its
ferro-alloys and abrasives subsidiary continued to undermine a strong
performance in the core brick and roofing tile business.
Group pre-tax profits rose 6 per cent to Sch363.4m (Dollars 30m) on revenues
up 6.2 per cent to Sch5.9bn. Profits of the brick and tile division,
however, soared 93 per cent to Sch273m, on sales up 15.2 per cent to
Sch1.6bn.
Mr Erhard Schaschl, chairman, said new housebuilding activity in Austria and
Germany continued in spite of the general slump. Also, management had
concentrated successfully on improving profitability.
Restoring profitability to the Treibacher ferro-alloys business, which
suffered a loss of Sch166m last year, would take longer. World market prices
were being undermined by eastern European exports, and demand from the
aerospace industry was weak.
As a result of Treibacher's losses, Wienerberger last year suffered its
first profit decline in over a decade, with the pre-tax figure slumping 30
per cent to Sch626m.
Mr Schaschl said Treibacher was cutting costs and would break even next
year.
Sales at the pipe systems division were flat at Sch1.2bn. Profits were down
23 per cent to Sch34.5m.

Repsol 6%

<TEXT>
REPSOL, Spain's large state-controlled oil and chemicals group, yesterday
reported a 20 per cent rise in operating profits, to Pta73.6bn (Dollars
515m), for the first half of 1993, helped by the collapse of the peseta
against the US dollar .
The group said its net profits for the first half had risen 6.3 per cent
against the same period last year, to Pta43.1bn. Cash-flow rose 13.8 per
cent, to Pta92.2bn, with most of the increase coming in the second quarter
when the peseta suffered its third devaluation in less than nine months.
Repsol said it would have done even better - despite Spain's worst recession
in more than 20 years - had it not been for a drought which forced the
closure of its Puertollanos chemicals complex for most of the six months,
labour strife at its Bilbao refinery, and the short-term effects of the
peseta devaluation, which forced up retail petrol prices.
The cost of these setbacks was around Pta7bn. The group said the weaker
peseta had helped widen those commercial margins in its refining,
exploration and chemicals businesses, which are expressed in pesetas.
Operating profits in the exploration and production division rose sharply,
from Pta10.2bn to Pta13.9bn, largely because of the dollar's strength.
Losses at the chemicals group deepened slightly to Pta4.6bn.
Repsol said, however, it had noted an improvement in the chemicals business
in the second three months, even though the Puertollanos complex had only
come back on stream in June.

<TEXT>
SILVIO Berlusconi Editore, the Italian publisher owned by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group, could be floated within the next three months,
raising up to L600bn (Dollars 376m) for the heavily-indebted parent company.
Fininvest recently announced its group indebtedness rose to L3,333bn at the
end of last year, from L2,938bn in 1991. Bankers have expressed growing
concerns about its debts, built up during the heady expansion of the late
1980s, and about the downturn in advertising revenues at its core
broadcasting business.
Fininvest said net group profits for 1992 plunged to L21.1bn from L61.3bn in
1991. The decline was ascribed to higher interest costs and the effects of
the recession. Group sales rose slightly to L10,469bn from L10,096bn.
Adjusted for disposals, turnover climbed by 6.8 per cent.
SBE will this month launch a reverse takeover of Mondadori, Italy's biggest
publishing group, which is controlled by Fininvest. Although Mondadori is
listed on the stock market, Fininvest owns about 90 per cent of its ordinary
shares and 80 per cent of the non-voting savings stock. Placing a greater
proportion of the shares in the combined SBE-Mondadori group should give
Fininvest a substantial cash injection to bring down borrowings.
Fininvest said prospects for the current year were good, with retailing
performing particularly strongly. Sales at Standa, the Fininvest-controlled
supermarkets and stores chain, jumped by more than 20 per cent in the first
half, due partly to acquisitions. Revenues at Fininvest's insurance and
financial services operations had risen by over 30 per cent.
Analysts believe Fininvest may also be considering floating its television
broadcasting interests, currently grouped in the RTI subsidiary. Although Mr
Berlusconi has traditionally been reluctant to bring in outside
shareholders, growing financial and political pressures may increasingly
oblige him to change tack.
Last week, he admitted that listing RTI was being considered, but said no
timetable had been established.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: McKay hit by interest and refinancing
charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MCKAY Securities, the property investor and developer, reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 1.77m for the year to end-March.
Shares in the company, which last month agreed new financing arrangements
with its banks, rose 5p to 130p.
The outcome was struck after a higher interest charge of Pounds 3.89m
(Pounds 3.3m) and was further depressed by Pounds 686,000 of refinancing
costs and the effect of not capitalising development outgoings (last year
Pounds 701,000 was capitalised).
Earnings per share were 5.3p (10.4p). The interim dividend having been
passed, the proposed final of 3.5p is the sole distribution for the year -
last year's total was 6.7p.
Since the year end a supermarket in Brighton and two flats in south-west
London had been sold at prices above book value, directors said.
In addition, part of the office development at Staines, Surrey, and the
shopping development at Aldershot, Hampshire, had been let.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: In Shops buys discount chain for Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SHOPS, the Birm-ingham-based property group, is expanding its retail
business by acquiring the Milbank Foods chain for Pounds 8.15m, but is
seeking a buyer for its Executive Centres serviced offices subsidiary.
The company also announced reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds
2.8m) for the year to March 31, on increased turnover of Pounds 26m (Pounds
24.3m). The decline in profits reflected increased losses at Executive
Centres, from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 650,000.
The final dividend is lifted to 2.09p, making a total of 2.75p (2.63p). Mr
Tim Brookes, chairman, said the increase reflected confidence in the
potential of the enlarged group.
The acquisition is to be financed with a placing and open offer of 14.05m
shares at 58p each.
In Shops operates shopping centres of about 40,000 sq ft, divided into small
units licensed for 12-month periods to retailers. It has forged links with
discounters such as Kwik Save, Netto and Iceland, after discovering that the
presence of such an outlet could attract more customers to its centres.
Milbank has 25 discount stores in north-east England, trading as Job Lot.
They differ from conventional discounters by selling end-of-line and
short-dated goods, often rejected by other grocery chains.
They usually carry fewer than 1,000 product lines exclusively in the areas
of branded frozen foods, dry groceries and toiletries, with no fresh foods.
Mr Brookes said: 'Job Lot doesn't aim to compete directly with supermarkets
 -it doesn't even sell milk, butter or bread - but many shoppers go there
first to see what bargains they can pick up and then complete their shopping
elsewhere.'
Milbank's profits have almost doubled from Pounds 752,000 to Pounds 1.45m in
the past three years, with turnover up from Pounds 15m to Pounds 19.1m.
In Shops hopes that the presence of Job Lot outlets in its centres will
attract more shoppers, thereby stimulating demand for space. Its vacant
space has increased from 14.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent in the last year.
Mr Brookes said the Executive Centres operation had been hit by the
'decimation of the financial services industry' and a general over-supply of
office space which led to a fall in occupancy levels in its centres.
A Pounds 5.5m provision has been made for loss on the disposal, including
Pounds 4m of goodwill previously written off to reserves.

English China Clays has redeemed the last Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) of its
auction market preference shares.
The group redeemed Dollars 350m of Amps last year following a Pounds 209m
rights issue in February 1992. In June this year it raised another Pounds
113.4m through a second rights issue and said it would redeem the remaining
Amps.
ECC was one of the first UK companies to issue the securities, which are
counted as equity, although having some characteristics of debt. Sentiment
has turned against the securities, though, and the group has joined some
other issuers in redeeming them.

Firmer tea prices, reflecting the shortfall of world crops, helped
Williamson Tea raise annual profits by 68 per cent to Pounds 6.22m.
The advance from last time's Pounds 3.71m for the 12 months to March 31 came
on turnover ahead to Pounds 34m (Pounds 30.9m).
The group, which produces tea in India, Kenya and Tanzania, said the outcome
was also buoyed by a 'greatly increased' contribution from its Indian
associate.
The final dividend goes up to 12.5p, making 22.5p (20p) for the year,

John Jennings, the new chairman of Shell Transport, talks to David Lascelles
about its changing culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHN JENNINGS gets a good view of the Houses of Parliament
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and most of London for that matter - from his 22nd floor office in the Shell
Centre on the south bank of the Thames. 'It's hard not to let it go to your
head,' he said yesterday.
He is settling in to the chairman's office at Shell Transport and Trading,
where he succeeded Sir Peter Holmes a month ago. Unlike his predecessor, who
was famous for his effortless style and wide-ranging pursuits, Mr Jennings
gives the impression of a man who has come up the hard way. More heavily
built with a mane of white hair, he is blunter, less intellectual, though
like Sir Peter he is a Shell man through and through.
He will be announcing his first set of results today when Royal Dutch Shell
produces what are expected to be good interims.
Mr Jennings will say he is not content with them. 'In the last few years
we've become dissatisfied with our overall performance. We've become
convinced that we must improve returns on shareholders' funds,' he said. 'We
have to lift our game.'
These are hard words from a company which has a strong, even unassailable
position at the top of the world oil industry, with a reputation for
thoroughness and excellence. But recent years have not been easy for Shell.
Shell Oil, the US subsidiary, has performed badly, its Japanese associate
recently lost more than Pounds 700m on currency speculation, and Shell's
returns have not measured up to those of its main rival Exxon.
Could Shell have allowed things to go to its head?
'Complacency and arrogance are the siren voices of the successful. I'd hate
to think we were complacent. But sometimes no doubt we are.'
Several companies in the Shell group have costs which are too high, says Mr
Jennings. 'But rather than turning to Mecca and praying for higher oil
prices we have to look at what we can do to help ourselves.'
Shell has already announced wide-ranging job cuts and efficiency drives. 'It
is not just automating the past, but looking at the future in a creative
way, giving more people in the organisation access to what you already know.
By redesigning you can get rid of bottlenecks.'
As well as raising performance, Mr Jennings believes that Shell must
steadily work to modify its culture so that it becomes less intent on
expansion and more on improving its own internal processes.
'The people in the organisation who keep the company going 24 hours a day
seven days a week don't get enough recognition, but the builder of a new
project at the sharp end, the glamorous end, gets all the attention. This
leads to an acquisitive culture. It produces a state of mind which makes it
easier to add to the portfolio than to stand back and ask: is this something
we should be doing? We must be careful not to neglect what we have already
got.'
Mr Jennings, who has been a member of the group's managing committee since
1987, thinks he already sees signs of this cultural shift. The group
structure is being shaken up.
Parts of it, like the crop protection business, are being sold off, others
are being merged with other companies, like polyolefins with Ferruzzi of
Italy, or metals with Gencor of South Africa. 'These moves are not a cop out
which say we can't manage. It's all about making our portfolio more
profitable, more robust. We have to maintain our view of the horizon, not
stray into short termism,' says Mr Jennings.
Although Mr Jennings now occupies the chairman's offices, he stresses his
limited role in Shell's complex structure where ultimate power lies in the
five-member joint managing committee with Royal Dutch. 'I can't say 'Now
that I'm chairman things are going to be different'. I'm a member of a
collective team.' There are no abrupt changes of style in Shell, only a
'continuum'.
Where his influence will be felt strongest is in his four areas of specific
responsibility.
One is for the group's business in the Asia Pacific region 'an enormous and
exciting area' likely to produce the strongest growth - and one where Royal
Dutch has a history going back 100 years. Another is for coal and natural
gas, the latter in particular a growth area in which Shell has a large
position, though Mr Jennings says that gas will have to overcome the
obstacle of long-distance transportation. A third is for research, and the
fourth for health, safety and the environment, all of which he holds to be
of 'fundamental importance' to the group.
'We should be modest about the past. Through a process of selection you are
put in the role of custodian. You have to look after a portfolio of assets
built up over a century. To take credit for the past is wholly
inappropriate.'
He glances out at the view again. 'You have to keep your feet firmly on the
ground.'

Beales Hunter, the refrigeration and electrical components company, reported
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.24m for the year to May 31, bearing out the
profits warning made in June.
The company said then that a disappointing second half meant that the annual
profit would not match the previous year's Pounds 2.3m. That figure was
restated in yesterday's results at Pounds 1.86m under FRS 3.
Group sales in the 12 months rose to Pounds 47.8m (Pounds 41.7m). Earnings
per share came to 16.2p (15.6p).
The final dividend is maintained at 6.95p, for a total of 9.4p (9.25p).

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Restructured Prior in stronger position
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prior, the property trading and investment group that has recently completed
a financial restructuring, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 347,000 for
the year to March 31.
Directors said the year was devoted to negotiations and reaching agreement
with the group's bankers on the capital restructure. They added that the
profit arose from the release of a former provision for a guarantee in
respect of a discontinued operation.
In the previous year the group, ultimately owned by Scanfrost - a company
controlled by the family trust of Mr James Prior - incurred a deficit of
Pounds 5.18m.
Directors pointed out that the group now had 'cash in the bank, a totally
ungeared position with positive cash flow, a profitable business . . . a
nucleus of income producing properties and the possibility of substantial
tax losses to be set against future profits'.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Chieftain in red after write-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEFTAIN Group, the USM-traded specialist insulation and fireproofing
company, incurred an interim loss of Pounds 481,000 and yesterday reiterated
its forecast of a 'small' deficit for the full year.
Mr Peter Wardle, chairman, pointed out that the pre-tax loss for the six
months to June 30 was struck after providing an exceptional Pounds 990,000
for two branch closures and write-off of work in progress and debtors
following the appointment of receivers at Swan Hunter Shipbuilders, one of
the group's main clients.
The outcome, which compared with profits of Pounds 620,000 last time, came
on turnover of Pounds 7.36m (Pounds 7.63m). Mr Wardle said the order book
stood at Pounds 6.5m at the period-end and had 'prospects to substantially
improve on this by the end of the year'.
Losses per share emerged at 3.76p (earnings of 4.85p); the interim dividend
is reduced from 2.1p to 1.5p.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Haemocell hit by distribution hitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Haemocell, the medical equipment company, fell 23p to 121p
yesterday after the group dropped the exclusive worldwide distributor for
its only product.
At the same time, the company estimated its loss for the current year to
August 31 would be at about last year's level of Pounds 1.69m and warned
that final severance terms agreed with the distributor, Stryker Corporation
of Chicago, may affect the figures further.
Haemocell's product, a blood cleansing machine called S350, only received
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in October 1992. This was
followed by a rights issue and a launch on the US market through Stryker.
Mr Trevor Wilson, operations director and 10 per cent shareholder, gave few
details of the reasons for the cancellation of the contract because 'there
is a potential for litigation.' He said that the severance talks with
Stryker were amicable.
He acknowledged, however, that Stryker sales staff had only recently begun
their effort and that targets 'clearly had not been met.'
Haemocell had decided to end the relationship 'to make sure that there were
no adverse comments' about S350. There was a danger 'the product could have
been compromised.'
As a result of last year's cash call, the company has more than Pounds 4.4m
in the bank and Mr Wilson said there was no need to ask for more.
He has already begun the search for new distributors and offers so far
included one from Stryker's European operation. He said that finding a new
distributor for the US, likely to be by far its most important market, would
'take weeks or months'.
The machine purifies blood lost by a patient during an operation so that it
can be reinfused into the body a few minutes later.
The advantage is that the patient receives his or her own blood cutting down
the chance of infection from blood contaminated with, for example, HIV.
Each S350 costs abut Pounds 7,000, but a hospital also needs to buy
replaceable filters that cost about as much as donated blood.
The heavy capital outlay by comparison with conventional blood transfusion
methods has meant that there has been only limited interest from the
National Health Service where capital spending is tightly controlled.
Haemocell came to market at 85p in 1988.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Acsis seeks shareholder approval for
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACSIS GROUP, the nursing management company, is asking shareholders to
support a refinancing of its Pounds 12.6m debts so that it can continue
trading. It has broken covenants and repayment commitments on its loans and
had a deficit on reserves of Pounds 49.8m at the end of 1992.
The group, which yesterday announced a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.28m
(Pounds 21.7m) for 1992, had its shares suspended at 1 1/4 p on June 28. It
has undergone significant changes in its activities and management in recent
years and agreed a Pounds 2m refinancing in 1991.
Acsis owes Midland Bank Pounds 12.1m and other secured bank debts total
Pounds 500,000. It also owes Pounds 867,500 to the vendors of NMS, a US
nursing company now its main trading arm, which includes Mr Ephraim Barsam,
Acsis' chairman. Mr Barsam said Acsis intends to concentrate on the health
care market and will change its name to Premier Health.
The refinancing proposals involve the issue of 265.2m shares, 91.7 per cent
of the enlarged capital. Existing shareholders will be offered 44m new
shares at 1p each and there will be a 12 into 1 consolidation.
Under the proposals, Midland's loan will be cut to Pounds 3.1m, but will
bear no interest initially, and the bank will hold 5.3 per cent of the
increased share capital. The NMS vendors will hold up to 33.4 per cent of
the shares, and Foreign and Colonial Enterprise Trust will subscribe Pounds
434,000 for a 15 per cent stake.
A capital reduction will cut the deficit on the profit and loss account so
that Acsis can return to the dividend list.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Linton to take rest of Assoc Fisheries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINTON PARK, the diversified tea and coffee producer and food trader, plans
to take full control of Associated Fisheries, its 75.1 per cent quoted
subsidiary, through a merger under a scheme of arrangement which values the
fishing, food processing and transport group at about Pounds 21m.
The ultimate parent of both companies is Camellia, a quoted investment
company with interests ranging from fine art to tea plantations, which holds
a 68.2 per cent interest in Linton through the Lawrie Group.
Linton said it was offering one of its own shares and 70p cash for every two
shares in Associated Fisheries in an agreed deal which values the company's
shares at 135p each compared with 124p at Tuesday's close.
In their joint announcement the two companies said the terms of the merger
represented increases of 9.3 per cent in capital value and 15 per cent in
income for Fisheries' ordinary shareholders.
The merger has been approved by Fisheries' independent directors.
Linton has been a shareholder in the company for 20 years and acquired a
controlling interest in 1987. As a result the companies said they had become
'increasingly close in the pursuance of mutual commercial interests.'
Among other reasons given for the merger the boards of the two companies
said the deal would provide the opportunity for cost savings and give
Fisheries' minority shareholders the opportunity to participate in a group
with wider product and geographic diversity.
The directors argued this would enable Fisheries' shareholders to benefit
from more broadly based earnings which would be less reliant on the results
of one main division.
In 1992 Linton reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.66m compared with a
Pounds 1.16m restated loss.
Associated Fisheries yesterday also reported a 35 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.33m) for the six months to
June 30.
Earnings per share rose to from 5.53p to 7.98p and the interim dividend is
lifted to 1.25p (1p).
Turnover increased to Pounds 42.4m (Pounds 40.2m).

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Time for a new look - Neil Buckley reports
on how the DIY chains are fighting to survive in a changed environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH are the biggest DIY enthusiasts in Europe, according to a recent
survey. A quarter of Britons would choose to spend any spare cash on
improving their homes, compared with only 5 per cent in Spain.
As the recession has dragged on, however, even the British seem to have lost
their appetite for putting up shelves and grouting bathrooms. Boots has
recently been fending off rumours that it planned to close half of Do It
All, its DIY joint venture with WH Smith, after revealing it was its only
division to have suffered a fall in sales (of 7.2 per cent) in the three
months to June 30.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, told Boots' annual meeting the DIY market
remained severely depressed.
A month earlier, Mr Cyril Stein, chairman of Ladbroke, warned shareholders
that recent trading at its Texas DIY chain had been disappointing. Two
managers have left the chain in recent weeks.
After enjoying double-digit annual profits growth in the late 1980s, through
rapid expansion and nudging gross margins up from about 30 per cent to 34.5
per cent, the DIY chains have had a difficult 18 months. A damaging price
war broke out in late 1991 and flared up at intervals throughout 1992.
B&amp;Q, market leader with 13 per cent, saw operating profits fall from Pounds
90m to Pounds 81m in 1992. Profits at Texas, which has an 8 per cent share,
fell from Pounds 47.5m to Pounds 43.5m, while Do It All (6 per cent) saw a
Pounds 6m profit transformed into a Pounds 14.4m loss.
Now, with more than 1,000 DIY superstores in the UK - more than the number
of food superstores - but with the housing market unlikely to return to the
levels of activity of the late 1980s, retail analysts warn the outlook for
the Pounds 8.5bn DIY market is tough.
'The DIY chains have still got a long way to go, but they have got to get
used to operating in a much more sober environment,' says Mr Richard Hyman,
chairman of Verdict, the retailing research group.
The first attempt to come to terms with that new environment - the price war
 -proved a costly mistake. Verdict believes it cost the chains Pounds 45m,
partly in extra advertising costs, but mainly through lost sales revenues.
Increases in sales volumes did not match expectations and could not
compensate for the lower margins. Moreover, stores found it difficult to
cope with the number of customers attracted by their promotions.
Shoppers may have been alienated by the poor service, the fact that many
items were out of stock and by a suspicion that if the stores could offer
such low prices some of the time they must be overcharging the rest of the
time.
The chains are now starting to believe that the key to survival is to offer
permanently competitive prices, and to develop their own unique identity and
product offer.
B&amp;Q has abandoned sporadic deep discounting in favour of 'everyday low
prices', in line with the belief of Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of parent
group Kingfisher, that the way to make money in the 1990s is not through
pushing up gross margins, but through sensible trimming of margins with the
aim of shifting larger volumes.
Kingfisher is also expanding its new Depot format: large superstores of
80,000 sq ft or more, designed to appeal to the serious DIY enthusiast and
trade buyers. It is likely to have 30 Depot stores by the end of this year.
'Kingfisher has adopted a two-pronged approach which will make life very
tough for everyone else,' says Ms Kimlan Cook, stores analyst at NatWest
Securities.
NatWest Securities forecasts that 20 Depot openings a year could double
Kingfisher's DIY sales to Pounds 2bn by 1997-98.
Smaller chains such as Wickes and Sainsbury's Homebase are best placed to
withstand the Kingfisher threat as they have developed strong niche markets.
Wickes is a highly focused specialist, concentrating on repair, maintenance
and home improvement, with a strong own brand, and appealing to DIY
enthusiasts and the trade. Homebase, meanwhile, is stronger in gardening,
home furnishings and decoration, with concessions such as Laura Ashley.
Texas is thought likely to suffer. It has no answer to Depot and has not yet
moved to everyday low prices. Its recent 21st anniversary offer of 21 per
cent price reductions showed it is still prepared to resort to deep
discounting. But some observers believe Texas, too, is differentiating
itself by concentrating more on the home adornment market.
The sick man of the sector remains Do It All, formed from the merger of
Boots' Payless and WH Smith's Do It All in 1990 - just as the housing market
slumped. Saddled with some old stores in poor locations, it did not have
time to establish a coherent trading formula before it was hit by the price
war. Boots says it still believes it can turn the chain round by introducing
a new store format which groups products together according to different DIY
projects, developing its brand identity and offering better service and
information to customers.
Some stores analysts, however, believe Boots will have to reconsider the
chain's position in the market if it does not show a substantial improvement
in the next few months.
One final threat looms over the sector: the possible arrival of large-format
competitors from overseas, such as Home Depot of the US, of which
Kingfisher's Depot remains a pale imitation. As one analyst put it: 'If some
of the big US operators come over here they could make even the best UK
chains look like amateurs.'

cable deal

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STC SUBMARINE Systems, the UK-based subsidiary of Northern Telecom which is
about to be sold to Alcatel of France, has won a Pounds 100m contract for a
new transatlantic cable system.
The contract, one of STC's largest, is the first transatlantic order for a
cable applying STC's new optical amplification technology, which provides
significantly greater capacity than existing systems.
It has been bought by a consortium comprising British Telecommunications,
France Telecom and AT&amp;T of the US.
Called Tat-12, the system will consist of 4,000km of cable and 85 undersea
optical amplifiers for the link from Greenhill, Rhode Island, to Land's End
in the UK. It is due to be in service by 1995.
The contract underlines the earnings capacity of STC, which Northern
Telecom, the Canadian supplier, last month sold to Alcatel for Pounds 600m,
subject to the granting of EC and UK regulatory consents.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Glynwed improves 19% to Pounds 18.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED International, the metals and plastics processing group, achieved a
sharp improvement in first half profits but warned that 'it could well be
the final quarter of the year, at the earliest, before the group sees any
significant benefit from recovery.'
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June rose by some 19 per cent to
Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 15.4m), the fourth consecutive half of improved results
since the group reached the bottom of its own economic cycle in 1991.
However, Mr Gareth Davies, chairman, noted that the profits increase came
not from any increase in economic activity but from cost reductions and the
winning of larger market shares.
'We've developed our own recovery irrespective of the depressed conditions
around,' he said.
Earnings per share rose from a restated 3.84p to 5.73p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 4.15p but, unlike the last interim,
this distribution is covered.
Total payments for 1992 amounted to 11.65p.
Mr Davies said Glynwed's markets were unsettled, raising 'the prospect, once
again, of delay in achieving the considerable potential improvement in
profitability which any increase in activity would generate from the yet
lower cost base of the group.'
Turnover in the first half rose from Pounds 460.4m to Pounds 476.1m but the
division of operating profits was uneven.
Those of the consumer products division improved, helped by increasing
demand for Aga and Rayburn stoves.
Operating profits improved in the steels and engineering division as a
greater concentration on exports paid off.
However, in other divisions the position was less favourable.
Foundry products continued to be hurt by lack of demand from the depressed
construction industry, metal services suffered from weak aluminium prices
while plastics had problems with lower demand from gas and water utilities.
Plastics remains the focal point of Glynwed's investment programme. About
half of this year's planned capital expenditure of Pounds 25m will be
concentrated on this division.
COMMENT
Glynwed has taken all the orthodox steps to increase productivity - turnover
per employee is at levels last seen in 1989 when there were 2,600 more
people on the payroll than the current workforce of 11,100. The stock market
once deemed its 65 per cent sales dependence on the UK market as a weakness.
But not any longer; it is now a recovery stock. The trouble is that Glynwed
does not yet see the recovery that some believe is under way. It only sees
that things are not as bad as they were. That holds back profit growth.
Still, there remains the prospect of 1993 pre-tax profits at Pounds 45m,
producing earnings per share of over 14p. That puts the shares, at
yesterday's close of 305p, on a prospective p/e of 21.2, suggesting that
buyers looking for recovery stocks have already made their purchase.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline cuts 72 jobs under
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HODDER HEADLINE, the independent publishing company, has made 72 members of
its UK staff redundant under a reorganisation following the takeover of
Hodder &amp; Stoughton by Headline in June.
Further redundancies and a relocation will follow next spring when Hodder's
old distribution centre near Sevenoaks in Kent is closed.
About 150 employees there will be affected.
Headline's existing distribution company, Bookpoint in Abingdon, Berkshire,
will be expanded and an extra 70 people will be taken on.
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, group chief executive, said yesterday he expected a
net reduction in UK staff of 152 people.
'The great majority of these redundancies relate to the group's
administrative functions. The commissioning editorial teams are virtually
unaffected and there will be additional recruitment on the creative side of
the business.'
Because of redundancy and reorganisation costs a loss is possible this year,
but the company is then expected to perform strongly.
Mr Hely Hutchinson, who founded Headline, said yesterday the backlist of the
125-year old Hodder &amp; Stoughton had turned out to be stronger than expected.

consideration due to shareholders linked to Mr Clive Smith. The Midlands
entrepreneur's family owns 19 per cent of the mobile communications company.
Mr Edward Clucas, chairman, said he was considering the step following
questions from shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting over the deferred
share payment.
CT is the child of a reverse takeover in 1990 by the then quoted company,
Image Store.
Image Store acquired CT for Pounds 3.74m in shares, plus deferred
performance-related payments, from Mr Smith's family interests, Mr Robert
Pollock, a former CT director, and Mr Clucas, former financial adviser to Mr
Smith.
Companies which have been linked to Mr Smith are under investigation by the
Serious Fraud Office. Mr Pollock resigned from CT in June following
publicity over the collapse of Alpine Double Glazing, where he was chairman.
Shareholders also questioned CT on its plans. Mr Clucas said he remained
'reasonably confident' about prospects. It is understood CT is aiming for a
flotation in the next two years.
The meeting heard that CT had returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 516,760 for
the year to September 30, against a Pounds 369,070 loss in the previous 18
months.
The profit was struck after lower administrative expenses, eased by a drop
in the depreciation of intangible assets from Pounds 220,272 to Pounds
16,949. The return was also helped by the absence of last year's Pounds
876,083 provision for bad debts. Turnover was Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 11.5m).
The company did not purchase any new cellular telephones during the year.

FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: United Breweries reduces deficit to Pounds
189,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Breweries, the regional brewer and pubs operator, is believed to be
considering a capital restructuring for the second time in nine months.
It yesterday reported pre-tax losses down from Pounds 283,607 to Pounds
189,376 in the six months to May 31.
The board, which does not propose to pay an interim dividend, has not yet
examined the restructuring proposal, which might allow a payment sooner
rather than later.
The restructuring would involve writing off a negative profit and loss
reserve of about Pounds 3m against a share premium reserve of just over
Pounds 6m, and requires the approval of the High Court.
Since last November the ailing Wiltshire brewery has been managed by the UB
Group of India, the sub-continent's largest brewer and distiller. It forms
part of UB's assault on the UK drinks distribution market.
Mr Vijay Mallya, head of the UB Group, and his family have a 15.5 per cent
stake in the USM-quoted company.
Turnover for the half year improved to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.33m)
reflecting the acquisition of 37 pubs at the end of last year. Operating
margins rose to 9.44 per cent (4.49 per cent).
Mr Mallya said he had not anticipated the length of the UK recession: 'We
are not magicians.'
The small Stourbridge-based brewery, producing existing brands at near full
capacity, made a small contribution to profits but represented less than 1
per cent of the group's assets.
Mr Mallya said United Breweries made a nominal profit in May and was likely
to be profitable in the second half, but this might not translate into a
full year pre-tax profit.
UB Group has granted United Breweries sole distribution rights across the
European Community of four spirits brands which it plans to launch later
this year. It is introducing its UK-brewed Kingfisher beer into some of its
77-pub estate, which is being refurbished.
Draught Kingfisher has been excluded from a distribution joint venture with
Kent-based Shepherd Neame, which brews the brand in the UK under licence.
Bottled beer will continue to be distributed to Indian restaurants and
off-licences by the joint venture.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 386,320 (Pounds 343,511). Debt of Pounds 8m
gives gearing of 100 per cent, down from 350 per cent. Losses per share were
0.48p, down from 4.97p.
The company raised Pounds 6.9m in a placing and open offer in December as
part of a capital restructuring, and spent Pounds 8m on 37 pubs.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Leeds and the bee go for size: John Gapper examines the
logic behind the latest building society merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The division of spoils between the National &amp; Provincial and Leeds Permanent
building societies in their proposed merger announced yesterday is unusual.
Leeds is to retain its name, its head office, and its chairman. National &amp;
Provincial will contribute its chief executive, and a cartoon bee.
The bee, which is the society's trademark, and the chief executive, Mr David
O'Brien, are already the most recognisable aspects of N&amp;P. Both are likely
to become better known as a result of the merger which is intended to create
the third largest society.
The division of posts, offices and brands are odd enough. But the reasons
for the deal are at least as out of the ordinary. The overwhelming motive
for mergers in the past five years has been the rescue of small troubled
societies by bigger, better capitalised ones.
This merger is different both in scale and significance. It not only creates
a rival to Nationwide in asset size, it has also been negotiated from
positions of mutual strength. In deciding to merge, both societies have
given a signal that industry consolidation is entering a critical stage.
Both managements insist that they are attempting something different from
just a marriage of convenience. 'This is a true merger, not a rescue,' said
Mr Roger Boyes, Leeds' acting chief executive since Mr Mike Blackburn left
in February to take charge of the Halifax.
Yet that difference makes the task harder. In trying to create a larger
force in the overcrowded retail financial services market, the participants
already know the pitfalls. Unless they cut costs and achieve a real merger,
they are in danger of simply growing more unwieldy and bloated.
The example not to follow is Nationwide Building Society, which failed to
merge the Nationwide and Anglia societies properly in 1987. Nationwide is
only now starting to show signs of tackling the high cost to income ratio
and poor returns on capital and assets it inherited.
Yet those involved argued yesterday that they had little choice but to take
the risk. Mr Boyes said consolidation was dividing societies into large
distributors of products that include not only mortgages but life insurance
and equity products; and small local societies.
If the merger proceeds, it will mean that the new top three societies will
hold 48 per cent of the industry's assets, and the top five - including
Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich - 64 per cent. Concentration is such that
the top 20 already hold 99 per cent.
The process of consolidation has implications for other financial services
companies, including banks. First, life insurance companies and retail banks
are also trying to establish dominance in product distribution. Lloyds' bid
to take over Midland last year was intended to aid this.
Second, the emergence of larger societies increases the likelihood that
another will follow Abbey National, the second largest mortgage lender, into
public limited company status. The new Leeds may consider the idea.
But all this turns on Leeds achieving real gains from the merger. The
participants cited three benefits yesterday: economies of scale and cost
savings; more effective distribution of products; better management.
Cost savings are the most obvious. The new society intends to reduce the
combined branch network to 650 from 769, eliminating 1,600 of the combined
9,800 staff.
But both have a mixed history of trimming costs. Their cost to income ratios
of 42.8 per cent for Leeds and 40.1 per cent for N&amp;P are better than
Nationwide and Woolwich. However, they do not match the strict discipline of
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's 22.1 per cent.
The likelihood of distributing products better is less certain. N&amp;P is
already tied to its own life insurance subsidiary, but Leeds was about to
set up its own. No clear plan has been settled for combining the operations.
The question the respective chairmen and chief executives had most
difficulty answering yesterday was how their sales would be helped just by
being bigger. Size has helped Halifax, the largest society, to lead the
market, but will a society half its size be big enough?
Finally, there is management improvement. Mr O'Brien has achieved a
reputation at N&amp;P for using analytical methods such as 'process
re-engineering' which are unusual for a society. He said he would apply some
of these to Leeds, but it remains unclear how effective they will prove.
Two audiences will have to be convinced that the merger is worthwhile: the
US ratings agencies, which rate debt and so fix the cost of wholesale
borrowing, and the societies' members.
Mr O'Brien and Mr Boyes are walking a narrow line between the two in
deciding how much - if at all - to reward members for approving the merger.
By giving them bonuses, they would cut the capital ratios to which agencies
such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's attach great importance.
The threat of protests from staff and members, and yesterday's announcement
that the societies' debt ratings face review by Moody's, show that it is a
tricky balance. Many financial institutions will be watching to see if Mr
O'Brien and the bee achieve it.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Midland shows sixfold profit increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Bank, the UK subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, yesterday disclosed a
sharp improvement in profits, helped by buoyant trading income in treasury
and capital markets operations.
Midland achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 385m in the first six months,
against Pounds 60m in the same period last year. This was in spite of a 12
per cent rise in bad debt provisions in the bank's continuing operations to
Pounds 321m, against Pounds 287m.
The bank did not disclose separate figures for its Midland Global Markets
operation, but the bank's dealing profits were Pounds 296m, against Pounds
50m. This led to non-interest income of Pounds 854m, including trading
profits, exceeding net interest income of Pounds 840m.
Midland's holdings of debt securities, including UK gilts, rose to Pounds
9.5bn from Pounds 5.02bn. This contributed to a Pounds 6.1bn rise in total
assets to Pounds 67.5bn, against Pounds 61.4bn, in spite of a fall in loans
to personal and corporate customers.
Midland treasury and capital markets activities were merged with Hongkong
Bank's last year following the acquisition. The bank said profits had been
helped by the synergies combined with exceptional trading conditions in the
first half.
The bank paid a Pounds 50m dividend to HSBC out of attributable profits of
Pounds 282m, compared with Pounds 5m. Retained profits and Pounds 130m
additional capital included under EC accounting rules led to a rise in its
tier 1 capital ratio from 5.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Sir Peter Walters, chairman, said the bank was now able to take advantage of
any rise in domestic lending. The banks was 'actively pursuing'
opportunities to lend. But he said the bad debt charge showed 'lingering
doubts' about recovery.
The bank's ratio of costs to income fell from 73.3 to 61.4 per cent, in
spite of a 9 per cent rise in costs for continuing business - excluding the
Thomas Cook travel agency sold last year and its former merchant bank - to
Pounds 1.04bn.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, said there remained 'a lot to do to
develop income' in the branch bank. But Mr Pearse said there was not much
scope for cost reductions, a matter on which he was 'trying to educate the
parent'.
He said the bank was starting to re-establish its position in small
corporate business. It believed it had raised its market share to 12 per
cent from 9 per cent, although it was still below its peak of 15 per cent.
The domestic bad debt charge fell to Pounds 272m, against Pounds 277m, but
two large corporate bad debts accounted for Pounds 65m of this. Bank
analysts said yesterday that they believed the two debts referred to were
against Queen's Moat and Isosceles.
Firstdirect, the telephone banking operation, raised the number of accounts
to 400,000 at the mid-year. The Forward Trust leasing business made a Pounds
28m profit, up from Pounds 25m.
HSBC shares closed 19p up at 690p yesterday. It will report its interim
results on August 31.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Continental slide and redundancy costs limit GKN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial services group,
achieved virtually unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m in the first half
of the year compared with Pounds 60.9m in the same period of last year.
It suffered heavy costs of Pounds 10.5m for redundancies and restructuring,
against Pounds 4.4m in the first half of 1992, as the worldwide workforce
was cut by about 1,000 to 27,500 - including 600 jobs eliminated in the UK.
Mr Trevor Bonner, managing director for GKN automotive operations, said
around 500 more jobs would be lost by the end of the year.
Sir David Lees, chairman and chief executive, warned that the group faced
'another tough trading period' in the second half.
GKN's automotive components operations account for about 58 per cent of
group turnover. This part of the business was hit by the steep decline in
car and commercial vehicle sales in continental Europe in the first half,
partly offset by stronger demand in North America and the UK.
Mr Bonner said that car production in Europe had fallen by 15.1 per cent in
the first six months to 6.23m, while commercial vehicle production had
plunged by 27.7 per cent to 700,000.
He warned that car and commercial vehicle sales in Europe would continue to
fall in the second half and that a recovery would not start 'before well
into 1994'.
On a more optimistic note, Sir David said negotiations were 'well advanced'
between the British and Kuwaiti governments for the sale of GKN armoured
combat vehicles to Kuwait. The sale of more than 200 Warrior tracked combat
vehicles and more than 100 Piranha light armoured vehicles worth 'not less
than Pounds 500m' was likely to be agreed shortly. Production was expected
to begin in late 1994 and would secure around 500 jobs in GKN's defence
operations at Telford, Shropshire, for the next four to five years.
Group turnover in the first six months rose by just over 10 per cent to
Pounds 1.39bn from Pounds 1.26bn. Operating profits from continuing
operations fell to Pounds 64m from Pounds 67m.
The contribution from continental Europe slid to Pounds 27m from Pounds 42m,
while profits from America nearly doubled to Pounds 13m and the UK rose to
Pounds 19m from Pounds 16m.
The divisional breakdown showed a Pounds 5m fall in profits to Pounds 48m in
automotive and engineered products, while industrial services and
distribution went up Pounds 2m to Pounds 16m.
Earnings per share rose to 9.8p, compared with 9.3p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 8p.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Index-linked market set to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRENGTH of the UK's index-linked gilts market has prompted other
countries to consider issuing government bonds linked to their inflation
rate.
Officials from the Swedish National Debt Office have visited London to study
the workings of the index-linked market. Mr Jonas Lind, head of domestic
borrowing, said their main concern was whether there would be a sufficiently
large base of investors. 'There are only a limited number of natural
investors, consisting of insurance companies and national pension funds,' he
said.
Sweden's government bond market has grown by more than SKr130bn in the last
year to SKr420bn. The borrowing requirement for 1993 is around SKr200bn
(Pounds 16.6bn).
Meanwhile, the New Zealand Treasury 'has undertaken a project to examine the
UK, Australian and Canadian experiences', said Mr Phillip Anderson,
principal of New Zealand's debt management office in London.
Canada and Australia, the only other countries with similar markets, began
issuing index-linked debt in 1991 and 1985 respectively, and have recently
increased their activity.
Index-linked gilts account for about 10 per cent of the Pounds 172bn British
gilts market, according to the Bank of England, but the sector is considered
relatively illiquid.
The world-wide economic slowdown has squeezed revenues while inflating
public expenditure, pushing up government borrowing. Index-linked bonds are
an attractive way of funding this as they are tied to inflation, now at
historically low levels in many countries.
Index-linked bonds, particularly in Europe, may also prove attractive to
investors. Gilts traders report growing interest in the sector, including
the first signs of interest from overseas investors.
'Index-linked gilts represent a major opportunity to capitalise on a
forthcoming fall in real yields. Unlike conventional bonds they are
indifferent as to whether the fall comes through lower bond yields or higher
inflation,' said Mr Kieron Lynch, head of gilt sales at SG Warburg.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Rhone-Poulenc warns of 10% decline in first half
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN-RENE Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group
and one of the companies which will spearhead the government's privatisation
programme, yesterday warned of a fall in profits for the first half of 1993
and for the year as a whole.
Mr Fourtou told Les Echos, the financial newspaper, that the group's net
profits for the first half of 1993 were expected to be about 10 per cent
down on the FFr1.55bn (Pounds 175m) in the same period last year. This was
later confirmed by the company. The share price fell from FFr159 to FFr154
yesterday.
Two other companies on the shortlist of four groups to launch the
privatisation programme, Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and Banque Nationale
de Paris, also expect lower first-half profits.
Mr Fourtou said it was difficult to establish estimates for the full year
because of currency movements, possible cuts in interest rates and continued
uncertainty in several of the group's markets. 'But taking these elements
into account we think today that our results for the full year could be less
than those for 1992,' he said.
'The outlook for the year 1993 does not put into question the capacity for
our results in the medium term,' the chairman added.
According to Mr Fourtou, the expected fall in first-half profits reflected
the impact of recession in Europe which became more serious in the first
half of the year. He said that the group's organic chemicals and fibres
businesses had suffered from a decline in volumes and prices and that the
downturn in these markets had been more severe than expected.
Results in the speciality chemicals division, which produces food additives,
silicon, and chemicals for the paper and paint industry, were also below
target levels.
The agricultural chemicals and fertilisers business was hit harder than
forecast as reform of the EC's common agricultural policy cut demand.
On a positive note, Mr Fourtou said that interest payments should continue
to fall for the rest of the year as a result of improved cashflow and from
receipts from the sale of non-strategic assets. Last month, the group raised
an estimated FFr4.5bn from the sale of its 35 per cent stake in
Roussel-Uclaf, the chemicals group.
Mr Fourtou said the group's health and agricultural businesses would benefit
from the launch of new products which are in development.

<TEXT>
HOLED UP in a Tokyo hotel, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime
minister-designate, granted audiences to passing politicians and furiously
worked the telephone in an attempt to put names to places in the cabinet
expected to take power today.
In government buildings not far away, officials of the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, resigned to at least a few months in opposition, were
clearing desks and moving potted plants in preparation for a role alien to a
party which thought it had a permanent lease on power.
Unless the incoming seven-party coalition crumbles unexpectedly, the LDP
will be formally removed from office today at a special parliamentary
sitting, which will select a new prime minister and prove to a still
disbelieving populace that Japanese politics has entered a new era.
If the choice of cabinet members is an indication of politicking to come,
coalition government will provide some surprises. It was rumoured for much
of yesterday that Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, the consumer electronics
company, would be foreign minister, though the odds were lengthening early
today.
'Mr Morita has not been formally asked if he wants the job and his feeling
is that he does not want it,' Sony said, although Japanese politicians
sometimes signal their enthusiasm by denying that they have an interest.
Leaders of most coalition parties were expected to take cabinet posts,
including Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal party, who is likely
to provide a sense of continuity by becoming finance minister, a post he
also held when he was a member of the LDP.
Mr Sadao Yamahana, leader of the Social Democratic party, was apparently
torn between resigning to take responsibility for his party's poor election
performance and accepting a senior cabinet position. He was suggested for a
range of posts, including international trade and industry minister.
Meanwhile, recently elected MPs from Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party were
lectured on life in the parliamentary precincts, including the need to
satisfy the tourist groups who pass through each day on guided tours of the
Japanese political culture.
Back in LDP headquarters, Mr Yohei Kono, the party's new president, was
displaying a confident smile that seemed to suggest that its stint in
opposition would be brief.
The smiles among officials of the coalition parties were of a different
kind. For those who are not ex-LDP members, power has always been far beyond
their reach, but by voting together today, they will sit for the first time
in the government benches.

FT  05 AUG 93 / VW calls crisis board meeting: Pressure grows on chairman as
group faces loss of at least DM700m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN directors with the power to hire and fire its top management have
been summoned to a meeting tomorrow to discuss industrial spying allegations
against senior executives and worries that the group will record a loss this
year.
The company said there was no reason to suggest that the job of production
director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, was in doubt. General Motors,
his previous employer, has accused Mr Lopez of carrying out industrial
espionage. The meeting is due to begin at 5pm GMT tomorrow.
News of an extraordinary sitting of the supervisory board came shortly after
a statement from VW yesterday that it is to cut a further 3,000 jobs in
Germany by the end of 1994.
Earlier this year, the company said it intended to reduce the payroll at its
six domestic plants by 12,500. More than 5,000 workers have gone since then,
and a further 10,000 jobs will disappear in the next 17 months.
Analysts said the group faced a loss of at least DM700m (Pounds 272m) this
year, as VW executives continued to back away from their earlier, persistent
claims that it would break even despite a first-quarter deficit of DM1.25bn.
Observers calculate turnover could fall by 10 per cent this year, while VW's
own profit forecasts are based on a decline of 5 per cent - a target which
company officials describe privately as 'over-optimistic'.
'It is clear that our earnings forecast cannot be attained if the drop in
sales is larger,' Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, said in an interview.
With his own confident forecasts in doubt while Mr Lopez and three members
of his new cost-cutting team are under criminal investigation, Mr Piech
faces increasing pressure.
He drew fire last week from politicians and business leaders for a clumsy
attack on GM with xenophobic overtones. His attempts to fight back in what
he calls a 'war' with GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel led to
accusations that he was damaging Germany's reputation. Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
economics minister, intervened personally with an offer to mediate.
The VW supervisory board, including representatives of Germany's leading
banks, unions and the state of Lower Saxony, which owns almost 20 per cent,
has so far been solidly behind Mr Piech and his team.
A recent meeting between a small group of management and supervisory board
directors decided that it would withdraw support for Mr Lopez only if he
were ultimately found guilty.
Mr Piech, who has unequivocally bound his fate to that of his Spanish
colleague, is expected to tell the meeting tomorrow evening of Mr Lopez's
'stupendous performance' so far.
On Tuesday, Mr Klaus Volkert, representing the Volkswagen workforce, said he
would withdraw his backing if charges seemed likely against Mr Lopez.
The group's North American subsidiary said yesterday sales of Volkswagen
cars in the US last month were down 46 per cent on July last year. With
total deliveries to customers of 25,000 vehicles, sales in the first seven
months of the year had fallen 48 per cent.
Mercedes-Benz said its July sales in the US were up 45 per cent. In the year
to the end of last month sales were down 12.6 per cent at 34,590.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Agency to help speed up roadbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, the transport secretary, will this morning announce the
creation of a special government agency to build and maintain Britain's
trunk road and motorway network.
The transport department expects that 'years' can be slashed off present
completion times, without interfering with people's right to be consulted or
to object.
The agency will be headed by a chief executive reporting to Mr MacGregor.
The transport secretary will decide the overall roads strategy, leaving
day-to-day management to the agency.
The decision, foreshadowed in the transport department's annual report, is
part of a package of six measures to speed up the roadbuilding programme.
The measures will remove the red tape which means that completing a new
trunk road takes, on average, 13 years.
Much of the saving could be achieved by speeding up internal procedures in
the transport department, Mr MacGregor believes. The measures would allow
different parts of the roadbuilding process to proceed in parallel, rather
than consecutively as at present.
Mr Paul Channon, the former transport secretary, set out a 10-year Pounds
20bn programme of roadbuilding in 1989 in a white paper, Roads for
Prosperity. However, the transport department recently admitted it would
take 20 years to complete.
A further use of 'design and build' contracts would speed up roadbuilding,
by allowing a single contractor to bid for both the design and construction
phases.
Lobbyists such as the RAC have been campaigning for reforms to the planning
system, which allows objectors great scope to delay new roads.
'We fully accept there should be a full public inquiry, and
environmentalists should have their say,' said Mr Edmund King, RAC campaign
manager. 'But is it feasible that you have 50 people all putting across the
same thing?' The RAC also believes that residents whose homes stand in the
way of road schemes should be compensated above market prices.
More than 80 executive agencies have now been created in the civil service
to improve the delivery of public services such as the payment of benefits
and vehicle registration.

FT  05 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: GKN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps surprisingly, GKN's barely-covered dividend is regarded by many as
watertight protection from the world recession. But then, glancing round at
other uncovered - and rudderless - UK engineering companies, one takes the
point. Life in the automotive components sector will continue to be tough,
with European car output likely to be down by 15 per cent this year, and
1994 unlikely to be much better. Unlike others, at least GKN has managed to
keep a grip on costs and maintain profits.
Admittedly, GKN has been helped out by better performances in the UK and
North America, and the devaluation of sterling has flattered profits by
around 11 per cent. Then again, underlying cash flow is strong and being
invested in new plant. The company is also struggling manfully with adverse
operational gearing which can be expected to boost profits once the market
turns. In local currency terms, continental European turnover fell by 15 per
cent, but profits are down by 55 per cent.
To some extent, that recovery prospect may sooth the nerves of those who
fret about GKN's 60 per cent premium to the market. There may also be growth
if GKN can continue to pick up market share, more US light trucks start to
use front-wheel drive and the Kuwaiti order for Warrior vehicles finally
materialises. The shares' 5.25 per cent yield is unlikely to be fattened by
anything as bizarre as a dividend increase. Yet at least it offers a warm
place to wait for recovery.

FT  05 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having misread the interest rate trend so badly - and so expensively - in
the still recent past, Midland might have looked the least likely of the
clearers to wade into the gilts market. But the expertise and capital of its
new parent have allowed it to set an example in this respect. Not all the
Pounds 3.62bn first-half increase in its securities holdings represents
gilts, but its decision to exploit the yield curve has not only boosted
trading income. It has also helped to limit the squeeze on domestic net
interest margins. Midland thus demonstrates that there are rewards for banks
which do more than sit on their hands in difficult lending markets. Others,
such as Barclays and National Westminster, may feel too constrained by
capital or worried by risk to follow suit. And Mr Roger Bootle, the Midland
group's gilts guru, is an outspoken bull of that market. The real test,
though, will come when interest rates stop falling. Profits in gilt-edged,
as in foreign exchange, are difficult to sustain. Nor should the glittering
performance of Midland's treasury obscure the continuing difficulties of UK
branch banking. Loan demand is slow and, thanks apparently to Queens Moat
and Isosceles, provisions remain uncomfortably high. There could yet be an
unresolved dilemma between the need to contain costs and Midland's
aspiration to increase market share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since European governments are so reluctant to cut interest rates, one is
tempted to ask whether they are deliberately trying to keep their currencies
as close to the old ERM bands as possible. There is no evidence of any
private agreement to that effect on the sidelines of Sunday's meeting in
Brussels. But Belgium, Denmark and France retain considerable interest in
being identified with the core of stronger European currencies. Belgium has
intervened to heave its franc back within the old bands. Neither of the
other two would want to cut and run.
By moving to 15 per cent bands they have made made it easier to keep their
currencies under control. Speculation may offer less one-off spectacular
gains in what is effectively a free float, so less intervention is required.
High interest rates are penalising currency speculators, a factor which
clearly helped push the French franc up sharply over the past couple of
days. The authorities may simply be reeling in confusion. Like Britain after
it came out of the ERM, they have no policy target to replace the exchange
rate. The Major government waited nearly a full week after September 16
before it cut base rates to 9 per cent.
If continental governments are determined to live in the old world, though,
talk of US-style interest rates in Europe is certainly premature. The
premise on which recent equity market optimism was been based would be
revealed as false. But the authorities could simply be storing up trouble
for the future. Their natural instinct to shore up their currencies with
high interest rates risks preventing the right response when exchange
markets again begin to worry about high unemployment and recession.

FT  05 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: A Yorkshire pudding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When two building societies justify a merger by mouthing platitudes about
synergy and economies of scale, the natural temptation is to rummage through
their reserves. But, rare though it may be, the merger between the two
Yorkshire-based societies, Leeds and National &amp; Provincial, is not driven by
desperation. Rather, it really does reflect the desire to become bigger and
better. A national society with 650 branches and Pounds 32bn of assets is
undoubtedly big. Whether it can operate more efficiently will depend on its
determination to cut savagely both societies' bloated costs. The danger is,
though, that too drastic surgery will only antagonise staff and customers
alike. The experience of the Nationwide and Anglia merger is hardly a happy
precedent.
A broader worry is that size alone will prove no more than a temporary
palliative against competitive threats. Building societies are losing share
in the mortgage market at a brisk rate. This is partly a cyclical phenomenon
as the well of retail funding dries up as a result of low interest rates.
Arguably, it also reflects a structural change as banks target the mortgage
market more aggressively.
The banks are unlikely to fret much about an enlarged Leeds. But their
nerves would fray if more building societies agglomerated, converted
themselves into banks and broadened their distribution of financial
products. That may yet prove Leeds's ultimate destiny. Such entities would
be well placed to compete in providing modish bancassurance. The trouble is
if too many societies reached the same conclusion simultaneously, the
returns would diminish and the strategy would have to be rethought.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Isle of Man may cut timeshare rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE OF MAN, the legal jurisdiction for many European Community
timeshare contracts, is considering a law which will substantially shorten
the period during which buyers can cancel their contracts.
This could mean that many timeshare buyers throughout Europe will have a
lower level of consumer protection than the UK or the EC intends.
Government officials on the island favour a seven-day cooling-off period,
during which timeshare buyers can ask for their money back. This compares
with 14 days specified by UK law or the period of between 14 and 28 days
suggested for EC legislation.
More timeshare contracts in Europe are subject to Isle of Man law than any
other jurisdiction, according to Mr Norman Burden, chairman of the Timeshare
Council, which represents the reputable side of the industry in the UK, and
vice-president of the European Timeshare Federation.
He defended the seven-day period, saying most timeshare buyers who cancelled
did so within 72 hours.
Timeshare buyers purchase a number of weeks each year at a holiday resort.
The industry has suffered damage to its reputation because of high-pressure
sales tactics and other malpractices by some operators.
The Isle of Man completed consultation on the proposed law last weekend. The
legislation is expected to be introduced into the Manx parliament's next
session, beginning in October.
A consultative document prepared by an Isle of Man Treasury working group
and sent to industry representatives says: 'It has been suggested that if
legitimate timeshare business is to be encouraged to develop here, a shorter
cancellation period than exists in the UK would do much to impart a
marketing advantage to the Isle of Man.'
The document says that the island's Board of Consumer Affairs would have
liked to offer the same level of consumer protection as exists in the UK.
But it adds that the Timeshare Council and the European federation prefer a
seven-day cooling-off period.
The UK law, which came into effect last October, was regarded as providing
little protection to buyers as it did not apply where contracts were
concluded abroad. The Timeshare Council estimates that 75 per cent of UK
buyers enter into contracts abroad.
Proposed EC legislation suggested a 14-day cooling-off for contracts entered
into in the buyer's country of residence and 28 days for agreements signed
elsewhere in the EC. The European Parliament has recommended 21 days in both
cases. EC consumer affairs ministers are expected to discuss the issue in
October.
The Isle of Man is exempt from much EC legislation and will not be subject
to the directive.
An Isle of Man government official said yesterday that the proposed Manx
legislation was clearer than the UK law in that it specified that the
cancellation period should run from the date the agreement was signed.

By contrast with Sir James's former pupils, the Legal and General insurance
group didn't do anything to mark its chairman's 60th birthday last month.
Any celebrating will have to wait until next May when Sir James finally
steps down after 14 years at the helm.
However, bets are already being placed on who will take over the L&amp;G chair.
Will it pick another business academic or, following the Prudential's
example, will it promote David Prosser, the current chief executive? Given
that Prosser has been in his job only for a couple of years and is still
under 50, the betting must be that Ball will be replaced by an existing
non-executive director.
BET chairman Sir Christopher Harding would seem the favourite but, given his
increasingly full portfolio, BAA chief executive Sir John Egan could stand a
chance.
Of course, L&amp;G could be really brave and appoint a female chairman. Jones
Lang Wootton's formidable Honor Chapman, for example, has just got on to the
board. She is one of the very few women to have made it to the top in the
male-dominated property industry.
If Sir Christopher Benson, ex-boss of MEPC, is right for Sun Alliance,
surely a case could be made for Chapman at L&amp;G?

Onto Observer's desk yesterday landed an article by Treasury permanent
secretary Sir Terence Burns, one of the Treasury's great survivors, destined
for a book of essays to be published this autumn marking Sir James Ball's
60th. He and Sir Terence were big buddies at the London Business School.
What a ghastly thought if the Brits should be aping that irritating little
German habit of bringing out a so-called Festschrift commemorating
significant birthdays or retirements of corporate worthies. Pompous Germans
issue Festschrifts because there is no equivalent of the Times Court
Circular page. In practice, they are chunky tomes that mostly just gather
dust on otherwise empty office bookshelves.

No prizes for guessing which countries earned top marks at the 32nd
International Youth Skill Olympiad just closed in Taiwan. Of course - the
host nation and South Korea, producing 30 medals between them.
Less predictable was the fact that joint fifth, with Austria, and ahead of
the impeccably highly qualified Germans was, yes, Britain. Overcoming a
reputation for a lousy workforce with a paucity of skills, the Brits managed
three silver and six bronze medals, with five diplomas of excellence to
boot.
Round the other side of the world, British yoof shone particularly in
construction skills, with medals in bricklaying, stonemasonry, plastering,
plumbing and joinery. Why on earth can't they do it at home?

FT  05 AUG 93 / Observer: When bigger is better
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the staff of the Leeds Permanent Building Society think that they will
have no problem getting on with their close neighbours in Bradford then they
had better brace themselves for their first jargon lesson from the new chief
executive they are inheriting from National &amp; Provincial.
Less well-travelled Yorkshire folk might be forgiven for thinking that N&amp;P's
David O'Brien belongs to some sort of moonie sect.
O'Brien, 52, an ex-IBM man, has only been running N&amp;P for three years and
for most of the time has been engrossed in a 'business re-design' programme.
Bent on replacing the functional hierarchy with a new culture based on
teamwork, O'Brien talks of a world in which staff are players, a meeting is
a team event, a task is a journey and jobs have become roles.
When O'Brien takes his new seat on the direction management team - sorry,
board - of what will be one of Britain's top three building societies, one
of his first challenges will be to explain how the latest move squares with
his earlier thoughts on the subject of size.
'To think business is about acquiring other people is missing the whole
point,' he told the FT a few months ago. He was at pains to clarify this
yesterday, insisting that the new society would be a merger of equals, not
an acquisition. But there was little sign of him dropping his new-fangled
ideas. Far from retreating, he said the new Leeds would be 'driven to' a
similar approach by having to merge managements.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Changing Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE PAST 30 years the world has got used to thinking of Japan as a great
economic power, one of whose strengths was that it combined formal democracy
with total political stability. Japanese prime ministers came and went, but
few outside Japan remembered their names. They did not matter because they
all belonged to the same Liberal Democratic party (LDP), and their
individual impact on policy was negligible. These septuagenarians succeeded
each other according to an elaborate queueing system, modified by an endless
and obscure struggle between factions with no discernible political content.
Japanese politicians were assumed (like politicians in several other
democracies) to be corrupt, to a greater or lesser degree, but that did not
matter either. It was all part of the system, and there was no prospect of
it changing.
Today, however, it will change. The parliament elected last month has to
choose between two candidates for prime minister, both in their mid 50s.
Barring some extraordinary last-minute hitch, it will elect Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the leader of the Japan New Party. The LDP will go into opposition
for the first time in its 38-year history. Ms Takako Doi, a woman and a
socialist, will become speaker of the lower house.
This will not mean any immediate or dramatic change in Japanese policy. The
new government is composed of seven parties ranging in ideology from
socialist via Buddhist to conservative. The policies on which they have been
able to agree are, in so far as they have yet been spelt out, essentially a
continuation of the previous government's - especially in those areas such
as foreign affairs and economics which are of greatest interest to the
outside world.
The main agenda of the new government is 'political reform', but even the
content of that is not too clear, beyond a pledge to introduce a new
electoral system in which half the MPs will be elected in single-member
constituencies, the other half by proportional representation. (The present
one, involving a single, non-transferable vote in multi-member
constituencies, discourages opposition parties from putting up enough
candidates to win a majority, lest they spread their votes too thinly, and
has therefore tended to perpetuate the LDP majority.)
The LDP hopes confidently, and not without some reason, that on the details
of this and other issues the coalition will soon fall apart, enabling it to
return to office on the basis of a deal with one or more of the smaller
parties. But even if that happens, Japanese politics will still have changed
irreversibly. A new generation has taken over, without waiting until it has
passed what in other countries would be retirement age. A single-party
system has been replaced by a multi-party one. From now on politicians and
the electorate will both know that the latter can turn the former out of
office. Japanese democracy has come of age.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Nuclear decision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND round of public consultation on the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant offers a chance for full consideration of this enormous
and controversial project, which has taken nearly 10 years to build.
Unfortunately, the government's statement yesterday suggests that this
opportunity may be missed.
There are two areas which need to be addressed: environmental and economic.
Ministers say that environmental considerations were adequately covered by
the first public consultation which ended in January and that they are now
'minded to grant' authorisation. Although the second public consultation
calls for comments on economic and diplomatic factors, the government adds
that these are 'not relevant' to its eventual decision.
This narrow interpretation of ministers' remit is not satisfactory. If
British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, makes a loss, the taxpayer will
foot the bill; if reprocessing saddles its main UK customers, Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear, with unnecessarily high costs, the
electricity consumer may face higher charges. The economic case must be
explored without prejudice.
The consultation documents issued yesterday make an unpromising start. They
contain only part of a key report by Touche Ross which is the basis of BNF's
profit projections, and the government has not endorsed or separately
audited BNF's figures.
Nor do they include enough to permit a judgment to be made about BNF's claim
that cancellation would cost the UK Pounds 900m in cash flow - a figure
which is partly dependent on BNF meeting its cost targets. Furthermore,
important details of BNF's contracts with its main overseas customers,
German and Japanese utilities, are withheld. Ministers recently suggested
that if Thorp were cancelled, compensation to customers could run to Pounds
5bn. However, the report puts the maximum at Pounds 4bn and adds that the
contracts provide BNF with 'robust legal protection' against this event.
An independent examination of the economic case is the minimum needed to
answer these uncertainties. But the government should also address the
question of whether the UK and Thorp's customers might collectively benefit
from cancelling the plant. This possibility, known as the 'win-win' option,
has been diplomatically inaccessible because all sides fear they might be
liable for penalties if they initiated cancellation.
Taken to one extreme, this option might even encompass sending Thorp's key
components to Japanese utilities, who make up a third of the plant's order
book and who have funded much of its construction. The Japanese government,
which is planning its own reprocessing plant, is concerned about the
prospect of shipping reprocessed plutonium back from Thorp. If the second
public consultation is not to be a rubber stamp, the government should
consider these issues fully.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Leading Article: The choice over Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT ALMOST every turn during the grisly demise of Bosnia-Hercegovina, the
governments of the US and the European Community have somehow contrived to
make a desperate situation worse. By prematurely recognising a state which
did not enjoy the support of many of its own citizens, they helped to
precipitate the civil war. By issuing threats against the Serbian
aggressors, they raised hopes among the mainly Moslem victims; by failing to
carry out those threats, they further emboldened the aggressors. In the
absence of effective western pressure on the Serbs and Croats the
international mediators have merely assisted in Bosnia's dismemberment.
Now, unless the latest flurry of international concern produces radically
different results, the final humiliation seems to be at hand. In Bosnia
itself, the fighting rages as fiercely as ever with UN humanitarian troops
looking impotently on. In Geneva, EC and UN mediators play midwives to the
partition of Bosnia into ethnic mini-states and press the Moslems formally
to accept their defeat. Worst of all, in Sarajevo, defeat for the Moslems
looks like turning into disaster as the Serbs complete a ring of artillery
on strategic heights round the capital.
And what is the west's response? More meetings, which may - provided command
structures and objectives can be agreed - result in air strikes against the
Serbs. Small wonder that President Milosevic and his Bosnian proxies seem
unconcerned.
There is, in fact, at least a possibility that Tuesday's Nato agreement  -
under heavy US pressure - to resort to air strikes unless the Serbs stop
their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo, will produce results. America's allies
having swallowed their reservations about the risks to their ground troops
and agreed to so explicit a threat, it is hard to see how they can avoid
following through.
The question remains: what can air strikes on their own be expected to
achieve? The Bosnian conflict, as much as any war, is about control and
denial of territory; it is fought on the ground, with infantry, tanks and
artillery. Air power may be of some use as a political signal, but its
influence on the actual fighting will be marginal at best unless it forms
part of a more carefully thought-out overall strategy for the defence of
Sarajevo. Given that the Clinton administration has refused to deploy ground
forces in Bosnia, it is ill-qualified to take the lead in elaborating such a
strategy. Those who do have troops in situ under the UN flag must thus
urgently start work on one themselves.
To demand this is simply to ask that western countries fulfil their own
pledge to create, and defend, 'safe areas' for the Moslems and prevent
Serbia and Croatia from completely carving up Bosnia between them. If
Sarajevo falls, that pledge, like all the others, will be exposed; two-way
partition will be complete; and Europe east as well as west will be faced
with an increasing influx of uprooted, stateless, desperate people. It is a
tragedy that must be prevented.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Long slog to a smooth landing: China's economic tsar is
trying to impose a tough stabilisation programme to prevent overheating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stakes could scarcely be higher: for Mr Zhu Rongji, who was entrusted
last month with wide-ranging powers to restrain China's runaway economy; for
foreign investors who have poured billions of dollars into China in the past
decade; and for the country itself.
Failure by the reformist Mr Zhu, China's senior vice-premier in charge of
the economy, to regain control, and more importantly to curb inflation,
would almost certainly invite pressures from Communist party conservatives
for more decisive action, thus risking a return to the boom-and-bust cycle
of the 1980s.
Mr Zhu, known colloquially as China's economic tsar, has wasted little time
in seeking to impose a tough stabilisation programme since panicky
colleagues handed him unprecedented powers over the economy. His initial
efforts to restrain inflation, restore order to China's chaotic public
finances, and to curb rampant speculation in land and other commodities
appear to be making an impact; but he must be well aware that it will be
months before he can claim a semblance of victory, and perhaps at least a
year before it is possible to judge whether his medicine is working.
In the meantime, for foreign investors no less than for Chinese enterprises
and provincial governments, the paramount question is whether China is able
to avoid the 'hard landing' that afflicted its economy in 1988-89 during a
previous period of severe retrenchment.
Western officials and Chinese economists believe that the stabilisation
plan, with its credit curbs and much-needed measures to impose financial
discipline, stands a reasonable chance of success, but they also predict a
'bumpy' road ahead.
While Chinese officials continue to talk of 'macro-economic controls' to
slow growth, which reached an annual real rate of 13.9 per cent in the first
six months of this year, they have been obliged to resort to cruder methods
to achieve their ends. These have included a series of administrative
measures, such as demands that banks and financial intermediaries call in
loans for speculative real estate projects, and a mandatory requirement that
both public and private-sector employees purchase unsold government bonds to
help fund the budget deficit of more than 80bn yuan (Dollars 14bn).
The central authorities have also fallen back on a practice often employed
in the past when they felt their will was being ignored: 'investigation
teams' have been dispatched to the provinces, ostensibly to report on local
developments, but in reality to enforce directives. Mr Zhu's appointment as
governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, along with his
other responsibilities as senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, was
designed to send a powerful signal to provincial officials and
representatives of financial institutions that they ignore central
government edicts at their peril.
The appointment of someone of Mr Zhu's seniority to head the central bank is
a sign not only of the depths of the leadership's panic about an economy
spiralling out of control; it also reflects deepening worries about an
erosion of party control over the provinces. Economic liberalisation and
devolution of power had come to be seen not as the promise of a glorious new
dawn, but as a monster threatening to devour its master.
It is perhaps a tribute to Mr Zhu's force of personality that he appears,
for the moment, to have imposed a new sense of sobriety on hyperactive
provincial chiefs who had sought to outbid each other in a scramble for
investment funds. The Chinese press is crowded with the statements of local
officials admitting their overzealousness, and committing themselves to the
stabilisation programme.
But this bout of self-criticism probably derives as much from an age-old
tendency of Chinese officials to set their sails to the prevailing wind,
while biding their time for the next wind-shift, as it does from genuine
remorse. Mr Zhu, who will accumulate enemies during this retrenchment phase,
must know that he can hardly afford to falter.
While his confirmation as the supreme figure in charge of China's economy
provides considerable opportunities for his advancement, it also makes him
especially vulnerable should things go awry, at a time when the leadership
itself is unstable as manoeuvring intensifies in preparation for the
post-Deng Xiaoping era. Mr Zhu also suffers from the lack of an independent
power base: as a former Shanghai mayor he is a relative newcomer to
Beijing's higher echelons.
China has been in transition from one generation of leaders to the next for
the past couple of years, but the worst of the factional conflict can be
contained as long as Mr Deng, or those speaking for him, remains a force
behind the scenes. Chinese officials have discounted the recent spate of
rumours about Deng's deteriorating health, but there is no doubt that he is
much frailer now than he was a year ago.
But Deng's recent reference to problems with China's peasants, suggesting
that their 'burden has already surpassed the limits of their endurance'
certainly helped to focus attention on one of the most critical problems
facing the government. Unrest in the countryside is being fuelled by growing
resentment over disparities in wealth between urban and rural areas. Average
rural per capita net income is about Yn770 annually, less than half that of
urban dwellers.
Peasant unhappiness over the income gap, and crippling taxes and levies,
spilled over into dozens of incidents in the past year across the country,
including the storming in June of government offices in a county
headquarters near Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, where angry farmers held local
officials captive to protest against the levying of a road-building fee.
Increasing restiveness among China's 900m rural dwellers has preoccupied the
leadership for months, and was certainly a catalyst for the stabilisation
programme, one aim of which is the redirection of investment to agriculture,
which had been starved of funds as 'hot money' poured into industrial
development zones and real estate projects in coastal regions.
Significantly, the authorities have suspended all price reforms for the rest
of this year. A principal cause of farmers' unhappiness has been the sharp
rise in the costs of agricultural inputs, such as fertilisers and
pesticides, along with the difficulties they have faced in redeeming IOUs,
in effect promissory notes, for grain acquired compulsorily by the state.
Farmers have been promised that the backlog of billions of yuan in IOUs will
be honoured, but with the authorities seeking to restrain rapid money supply
growth, the promised pay-out will squeeze funds available elsewhere in the
economy. Chinese participants in prospective joint ventures have, for
months, been putting pressure on their foreign partners to secure additional
investment funds abroad as sources of domestic funding dried up. Foreign
investors can expect more of this in the coming period as the government
enforces its credit curbs.
Not least of the challenges facing Mr Zhu is a pervasive corruption that
reaches high into the Communist party itself. With China's laws still
evolving, and with the system having entered a murky transitional phase
between a centrally planned and a market economy, opportunities for corrupt
officials to profit have become almost boundless, especially in the area of
land allocation for real estate. The embryonic privatisation process is also
proving fertile ground for officials seeking to feather their own nests in
an opaque system where back-door deals tend to be the rule rather than the
exception.
Mr Zhu and his supporters appear to have acted with restraint so far in
dealing with officials in the financial sector who have engaged in a welter
of unauthorised lending, either through banks or, more commonly, through
affiliated financial intermediaries such as 'trust and investment' companies
(similar to venture capital groups) that have mushroomed across the country.
Mr Zhu is thought to want to avoid giving the impression at this stage that
he is about to launch a vendetta for sins committed during a previous period
of lax central bank control. He knows that he cannot purge the system
without risking further chaos at this delicate stage.
The main task facing the authorities is to ease pressures on prices.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the cocktail of credit restrictions and two
increases in interest rates since May may be having an effect. Prices for
building materials such as steel and cement have dropped by about 15 per
cent in the past two months, and a property boom in coastal regions is
flagging.
But consumer prices are likely to prove more resistant to measures adopted
thus far, especially in view of the fact that in May and June urban
inflation exceeded 20 per cent on an annualised basis, according to a
western economist in Beijing, who noted that the authorities had been coy
about producing specific details for these months. The cost of living in
urban areas for the first six months of the year was 17 per cent higher than
for the same period of last year.
Officials are concerned that inflation and inflationary expectations have
become so embedded that interrupting the spiral will prove difficult without
resort to harsher administrative measures that would fly in the face of the
market reforms to which China's leaders claim they are committed. But,
judging by recent official statements, the temptation to intervene more
severely by strengthening the price control regime for some essential
commodities may prove irresistible if measures adopted thus far fail to
check the price spiral. On the macro level, further increases in interest
rates would seem to be unavoidable.
Other priorities include strengthening the Chinese yuan, which depreciated
in the past year by more than 50 per cent against the dollar on the
officially sanctioned currency swap markets where the bulk of foreign
exchange transactions are conducted. It has recovered some ground against
the dollar since Mr Zhu took command, and this is being hailed as an early
success. However, the central bank has been obliged on several occasions to
intervene to support the yuan at around nine to the dollar. The official
exchange rate remains at Yn5.7 to the dollar.
If all the above challenges are not more than enough for one man, China's
economic tsar is also being obliged to respond to pressures to reverse the
country's deteriorating balance of trade, which recorded a deficit of
Dollars 3.54bn in the first six months of the year compared with a healthy
surplus last year. Chinese officials have pledged to bring about an
improvement in China's terms of trade without resort to administrative
measures such as import curbs.
If the trade gap continues to widen, Beijing's central planners might find
it difficult to resist intervening, although western officials point out
that such a move would undermine China's case for membership of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Western officials also believe that China,
with adequate foreign exchange reserves of about Dollars 20bn, would be
mistaken if it became too preoccupied with reducing a 'manageable' deficit
on its trade account at a time when its 'modernising' economy is continuing
to grow at an anticipated rate this year of about 11 per cent, and at
forecast rates of 8-9 per cent for the rest of this decade.
Burdened though he is by the challenges involved in stabilising China's
economy, Mr Zhu also insists that he is committed to pressing ahead with
reforms so as not to lose the momentum generated over the past few years.
Among his most urgent targets are a further rationalisation of state
industries such as iron and steel, which accumulated losses last year in the
order of Dollars 76bn, and a drastic overhaul of an archaic banking sector.
The banks have largely been left alone, but reform is long overdue if China
is to move further down the road towards a market economy. China's banks
operate like cashiers, rather than agents of economic activity.
Few would envy Mr Zhu his task. But a hopeful sign for foreign investors and
for the Chinese is that, on this occasion - unlike 1988-89 when the economy
was brought to a virtual standstill by a series of tough administrative
measures - it is the reformists and not party conservatives who have seized
the initiative. The question is whether a lighter hand will achieve results
quickly enough to enable the reformists to claim an early victory. The signs
are that Mr Zhu and his supporters are in for a long, hard slog. Success is
far from assured.

Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf Aquitaine, yesterday cleared his
desk at the top of Elf tower in western Paris. Removed from his post by the
government, he will leave the state-controlled group, which is also France's
largest industrial concern, to take over as head of Gaz de France, the state
utility.
On the other side of the River Seine, Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Credit
Agricole, the country's largest bank, was similarly occupied. Chosen by the
government as the next head of Elf, he will exchange overdrafts for oil
exploration and loan policies for petrochemicals projects.
The musical chairs at the top levels of corporate France demonstrates the
extent to which the lines between the country's business and politics remain
blurred. 'There is no clear separation of powers as in the US and the UK,'
said a French banker. 'The hand of the government is still in evidence.'
For foreign investors, unused to the French practice of parachuting new
chairmen into public companies, this may provoke concerns - especially as
the government prepares to launch its programme to privatise 21 state-owned
companies. In particular, investors are faced with the questions of whether
Mr Le Floch-Prigent's departure heralds broader changes at the top of
state-controlled industry, and what effects such reshuffles have on the
companies involved.
In the case of Elf itself, named last month as one of the first four
companies to be privatised, there might appear to be cause for concern. Mr
Jaffre has a formidable financial background, having spent 10 years at the
treasury and having run Credit Agricole since 1988. But he has no experience
of running an industrial company. Moreover, he takes the helm at a time when
the oil group is confronting difficult markets.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent, credited with strengthening Elf in international
markets, has warned that depressed demand in the petrochemicals and basic
chemicals sectors will mean that operating profits for the first half of
1993 will show a fall of about 25 per cent compared with the same period
last year. 'I don't see much improvement in these areas this year,' Mr Le
Floch-Prigent, said at the end of last month.
But investors and oil industry observers appear relaxed about the change.
'Mr Le Floch-Prigent did a good job, but Mr Jaffre appears to be a very able
manager,' said one international fund manager whose company holds shares in
the oil group.
French industry officials argue that Mr Jaffre will inherit a strong team of
senior executives and that his experience of privatisation - while working
in the treasury during the earlier privatisation programme of 1986-1988 -
will be a big advantage in the forthcoming sale of the state's 50.7 per cent
stake in Elf.
If the selection of Mr Jaffre has met largely with approval, however,
international investors are wary that the move signals the government's
intention to retain a grip on the running of the oil group, particularly
since it has said it intends to keep a 'golden share' in the company.
Investors also hope that Mr Floch-Prigent's departure will not be the start
of broader changes at the top of French public companies.
'A certain amount of reshuffling comes with the territory in France,' said
one fund manager. 'But if it is widespread then of course it is unsettling
for investors and may mean that political motives are at work.'
There is little doubt that political motives were a factor in the changes at
Elf. A socialist himself, Mr Le Floch-Prigent was appointed to head the
group in 1989 by the socialist President Francois Mitterrand. The fact that
in 1981 and 1982 he advised Mr Pierre Dreyfus, then industry minister in the
socialist government, on the nationalisation programme, has damaged his
credentials in the eyes of the current centre-right government of Mr Edouard
Balladur.
But the message from Mr Le Floch-Prigent's exit is more that the Balladur
government is following a pragmatic rather than a political approach to its
relations with state-owned groups. 'It might have appeared unusual for
someone with Mr Le Floch-Prigent's background to spearhead the government's
privatisation campaign,' said Mr David Harrington, head of research at James
Capel in Paris.
Pragmatic as opposed to political motives are also suggested by the fact
that Mr Jaffre is regarded as politically neutral. During his spell at the
treasury he worked under both socialist and conservative governments.
The Balladur government has also limited its intervention in state-owned
industries. It has refrained from implementing a 'witch-hunt' of top public
sector executives as happened, for example, when the socialists took office
in 1981 and when the conservative government of Mr Jacques Chirac came to
power in 1986. Under the current government, the only other change at the
top of a state-owned company was the appointment in May of Mr Michel
Pebereau as chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris in place of Mr Rene
Thomas.
'The hand of the state is still at work,' said one oil industry observer in
Paris. 'But under Balladur it seems to be wearing a velvet glove.'
The test of the 'velvet glove' is likely to come as the government moves
down the list of companies to be privatised and the temptation arises to put
their own people in place before the controls of the state are loosened.
Most of the current chairmen seem relatively secure, although merchant
bankers in Paris say that question marks remain over Mr Jean-Yves Haberer,
chairman of the Credit Lyonnais banking group and possibly Mr Alain Gomez,
head of Thomson, the electronics company.
Both chairmen have links with the Socialist party. Mr Gomez was appointed by
a socialist government 11 years ago, while Mr Haberer had close ties with Mr
Pierre Beregevoy, the late Socialist prime minister. Both companies have
also been suffering losses, although they say they expect recovery this
year.
But with neither Thomson nor Credit Lyonnais facing imminent privatisation,
and with Mr Balladur's cautious approach, their chairmen seem safe behind
their desks for the time being at least.

FT  05 AUG 93 / The scapegoat butts back: The UK Treasury has gone on the
offence against critics in defence of its role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Criticised by many, loved by few, Her Majesty's Treasury is one of the
favourite targets of UK public life.
Industry alleges that it is biased towards the City and blames it for the
decline of British manufacturing. Business leaders accuse the Treasury of
refusing to allow the much-needed investment in infrastructure that would
improve international competitiveness. Economists charge it with
responsibility for UK economic decline - including mismanagement of
sterling.
Within Whitehall, the Treasury is the all-purpose scapegoat for ministers
and mandarins alike. It is the bank that loves to say 'no', the department
that counts the pennies and ignores value for money. Rare is the minister
who cannot find some role for the Treasury in explaining away departmental
policy failures.
In an unusual riposte, Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury
since 1991, has attempted to answer his department's critics. Today, he
releases a spirited defence* of the Treasury in which he strongly rebuts
many of the criticisms and explains how those that he believes are
well-founded have been addressed.
Sir Terry acknowledges that much of the criticism of the Treasury's role
relates to its powerful position at the heart of Whitehall. Its tasks
include functions that in most other countries are divided between an
economics ministry, a finance ministry and a separate budget office to
control public expenditure. It also manages civil service pay, supervises
the financial services industry and is responsible for economic forecasting.
Managing the economy is the Treasury's highest-profile role, although it
absorbs less than one-fifth of the department's 1,400 civil servants. That
role has often come under fire, most recently after the events surrounding
sterling's ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism
in September 1992. There has been an intense debate over the Treasury's
responsibility for monetary policy, with increasing support for handing it
over to an independent central bank.
Sir Terry can see the attractions of such a move, especially since the
European Community intends to place monetary policy in the hands of an
independent European central bank as a step on the road to monetary union.
He denies that there is a strong Treasury orthodoxy against an independent
central bank (or on any other issues). But he is at pains to set out the
complications involved in a change that he believes has assumed totemic
significance among commentators.
'The demand for greater independence of the central bank has come to be the
most popular single answer to the problem of inflation that was once
reserved for the ERM.' But there are advantages, he says, in elected
politicians - rather than unaccountable central bankers - making decisions
about, for example, the trade-offs between inflation and growth. ' 'Not the
government' is not a guarantee of wisdom,' he observes.
Much of the popular wisdom about the Treasury's alleged incompetence stems
from the record of its forecasters. Although their predictions have been no
worse than others over the longer term, their forecasting errors attract
widespread attention.
Sir Terry says that he is 'amazed' at the importance given to the forecasts
outside the Treasury's Great George Street headquarters. Its predictions are
an important input into policymaking, but not the only one - and ministers
are well aware of their frailty. 'Meanwhile, the other 1,400 people in the
central Treasury suffer the frustration of seeing their efforts judged by
the forecasts of 30 or so economists,' he adds.
A more recent subject for attack has been the Treasury's alleged bias
against manufacturing industry. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, is one who has criticised the Treasury
for its attitudes to business in the past.
Sir Terry accepts that there have been too few direct contacts between
Treasury staff and industry in the past. This may have meant that officials
have not always asked questions about the implications of economic policy
for business. It also meant that industry was often ill-informed about
Treasury thinking. 'We can do more to explain the background to decisions,'
he says.
Treasury officials are now encouraged to spend time in industry, and a panel
of industrialists has been created to offer advice. A 'supply-side' unit has
also been set up to give greater salience to business concerns in Treasury
deliberations.
These steps are welcomed by Mr Davies: 'The Treasury has always had an
interest in thinking about what a decision means for the financial markets.
Now they are trying to think about what it means for manufacturing
industry.'
Within Whitehall, the Treasury exerts powerful control over public
expenditure. No department can spend money without its agreement which, as
Sir Terry drily observes, 'means it has a keen interest in much of the
business of every department'.
In departments and agencies, that interest is often seen as a central grip
which stifles innovation and encourages counting of candle ends. Even though
the government is committed to delegation of financial management to the
lowest possible level in the public services, the Treasury is often seen as
reluctant to let go.
Chief executives of government agencies complain that, while they are given
performance targets to meet large budgets and responsibility over them, they
are constantly second-guessed by Treasury officials questioning decisions.
Treasury accounting rules are also needlessly inflexible, according to the
chief executive of one agency. 'I have very little discretion about moving
money from one purpose to another, or rolling over unspent money from one
year to another,' he says.
Many Treasury officials feel uncomfortable about delegating responsibility
for spending money to departments and agencies. From experience, they
believe that departments are often less rigorous in controlling expenditure.
At the top of the Treasury, there is a strong collective memory of 1976,
when loss of control over public expenditure led to a sterling crisis and
the intervention of the International Monetary Fund. As young high-flyers,
many had to tighten their hold on public spending at the behest of the IMF,
and are determined not to repeat the experience.
Sir Terry Burns is not scarred by that memory - he joined the Treasury from
academia only in 1980. He says there has been a move to a more strategic
approach to public expenditure, in which the Treasury helps to determine
priorities, sets targets and monitors progress. Increasingly, departments
are left to ensure that targets are met.
'This all involves the Treasury much less in the details of programmes and
rather more in the bigger question of priorities,' he says.
It is that strategic role for the Treasury, as a sort of head office of
Whitehall plc, that Sir Terry is anxious to defend. Rather than dividing the
Treasury into separate ministries for economics and finance, for example, he
wants it to continue to pull together 'all the strands of economic
policymaking across the government's programme'.
Sir Terry doesn't expect much thanks for this - as King James said of
treasurers: 'If they do good service to their masters, (they) must be
generally hated.' But he is prepared to accept that the Treasury must adapt
to changing circumstances and develop a clearer focus on its objectives.

autumn in a collection of essays to mark the 60th birthday of Sir James
Ball, professor of economics at the London Business School

FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: Risk and the cost of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY LEVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex (August 2) suggests that if electricity companies operate with 'too
much' equity, they incur an 'unnecessarily high cost of capital'. But surely
a company's weighted average cost of capital depends on the riskiness of its
operations and is independent of the company's gearing and hence of the
proportion of that risk borne by shareholders and bond-holders respectively.
Thus, the higher the gearing, the smaller the equity base that is called on
to bear the primary risk: therefore the riskier the equity and, in
principle, the higher the equity's beta. This should offset the effect of
the high gearing in reducing the proportion of the company's total capital
that incurs the debt-equity premium. Otherwise companies could reduce their
cost of capital simply by increasing their gearing - as indeed Lex seems to
believe.
Has Homer nodded?

FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: M&amp;S's plans for Brooks Brothers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir RICHARD GREENBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Nikki Tait's report on Brooks Brothers was inaccurate and misleading
(Management, July 8).
First of all, it is quite clear from the report that Miss Tait has no
understanding of the factory outlet business. When it was originally
introduced by other retailers it was, as described in the article, for the
clearance of surplus stocks, etc. It has moved on since then quite
dramatically, with thousands of stores having been developed by all the
great names in American retailing. Together with 'Outlet Malls', it has
developed into the fastest growing sector in a highly competitive American
retail scene.
Almost all factory outlets are distinguished by low occupancy costs and more
flexible staffing arrangements, which enable a retailer to sell the same
full-price product that he is selling in the mainline store at a
significantly lower price, while still making a profit. I think you will
find that even companies like Ralph Lauren now trade very successfully in
such stores. That is why Brooks Brothers has become involved and the sales
performance, together with the profitability that is developing, is clear
for all to see and should have been equally so to your reporter.
We certainly did change the archaic remuneration scheme which provided our
sales staff with an average annual salary of Dollars 49,000, which of course
means that many were earning as much as Dollars 70,000-Dollars 80,000 per
annum. This level of remuneration was almost twice the national average and
the majority of staff accepted a very modest change to their bonus system,
bearing in mind the mass unemployment that has occurred in American
retailing over the past five years.
We have not cut back on capital expenditure in Brooks Brothers and continue
to give it the necessary funds to modernise its stores, and in particular to
develop new information and distribution systems. Frankly, without these, it
would have no future.
We are not trying to popularise Brooks: clearly this wouldnot be in its
interests and we are not so stupid as to think it would be. Brooks Brothers,
however, cannot develop and grow based upon a declining number of ageing
Wall Street customers and must broaden its base at least into the
40-year-olds, while of course maintaining the loyalty of its more
traditional customers. We are succeeding with this policy.
It is not surprising that we are struggling to match the 1988 results: so
are most other American retailers; some of the greatest names are either in
the bankruptcy courts or have already closed down. It may come as a surprise
to Nikki Tait, but the American retail scene has been in recession for the
past few years and continues to be so. Throughout that time, Brooks Brothers
has consistently made a profit, which is more than can be said for many of
them.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: Waste elimination is 'green' priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLIE KRONICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If costs are to be at least partially the basis of future environment
and energy policies in the UK ('High cost of going green', August 2), then
it is unlikely that nuclear power will be a part of any policy designed to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions (C0) from electricity generation.
The recently published results of Nuclear Electric paint a rather grim
picture of that company's economic future. Take away the subsidy of more
than Pounds 1.2bn received each year from the electricity consumer, and
Nuclear Electric made an operating loss of Pounds 783m in the financial year
1991-1992, and Pounds 661m in 1992-1993, while at the same time stacking up
new liabilities for waste and decommissioning of almost Pounds 1.2bn (to be
added to the existing liabilities of almost Pounds 20bn). Meanwhile, it is
not just the environmentalists who are pointing out the potential of energy
efficiency and renewable energy. In 1989, the Department of Energy
identified cost effective energy savings potential of 30 per cent, with a
pay-back period of less than five years. Analysis of data from the
government's Energy Efficiency Office, submitted to the government's recent
review of the coal industry, shows that investment in nuclear power is only
one quarter as effective in reducing C0 as the poorest of the energy
efficiency measures examined. Money spent on nuclear power is only just over
half as effective as modern renewable technologies such as wind power in
reducing C0 emissions. Fully one third of the C0 reductions are available at
negative costs.
If the UK is serious about reducing C0 emissions, the first item on its
'green' agenda must be to put an end to waste; not just the waste of energy,
but the waste of money on dangerously polluting and massively expensive
technologies such as nuclear power.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Letter: Short contracts and 'hire and fire' mentality behind
job anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK DENNIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Rachel Johnson's article, 'Theories behind feel-bad factor' (August 2),
omitted several important reasons why people are still increasingly anxious
about losing their jobs - in particular compared with the previous economic
cycle.
The rising trend towards short-term contracts, part-time (especially female)
employment and the development of a 'hire and fire' mentality among
employers have been crucial. Also relevant would be the more even
distribution of unemployment, both geographically and occupationally.
Moreover, employment is still falling, despite the recent falls in
unemployment. This is a consequence not only of the reduced numbers of those
of school-leaving age, but also of school leavers and women being
discouraged from entering the labour market. When many women lose their
jobs, they do not qualify for unemployment benefits so are not registered as
unemployed.
Is it not time the UK started to put increasing emphasis on employment
figures, as they do in the US, rather than exclusively on unemployment
figures? Finally, it is worth noting that the greater fear of unemployment
is an important reason why average annual earnings growth has fallen to just
3.75 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the previous economic cycle.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Arts: Dance Workshop Europe - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the performance of a Cherubini opera, Berlioz was driven by its
Saharan tedium to shout out: 'Twenty francs for an idea]' Given the state of
the money market, I would have given a good deal more for the glimpse of a
step, let alone an idea, as Tuesday night's offering of Euro-dance dragged
on at the Place. 'Dance Workshop Europe' is designed to give a collection of
Common Market choreographers the chance to create during a period of five
weeks, then show the fruit of their lucubrations in Munich, London, Antwerp,
Ghent, Angers.
The creators are, of course, exponents of what we must call modern dance. It
is, linguistically, 'modern', in that it happens now, but the pieces on view
stretch the idea of 'dance' to the outer limits of the glum and the
pretentious. It was an evening as desperate in its fatuities as any I have
sat through at The Place during twenty years before its choreographic mast.
Modern Dance, of course, was the growth industry of the 1980s. Politically
correct, Yoof-orientated, it made such inroads into the educational system
that barely-trained (or untrained) young people were able to attend schools
and colleges and emerge at the end of their studies as 'dancers' and
'choreographers'. The fruit of this preposterous situation was the
mushrooming of inept dance during the decade.
Now the Arts Council announces that Contemporary Dance will benefit from
increased funding. Can this is an attempt to do something about the dreadful
standards of certain of our groups? Does it merely show a sense of duty to a
minority art? (Attendance and performance figures for some of the groups
whom the Arts Council favours might be intriguingly compared with those of
the popular and deserving London City Ballet whom the Council resolutely
refused to assist, and effectively killed off). Any fostering of new
contemporary dance might well consider its chance of survival, as well as
its artistic credentials. We have significantly good ensembles, quite apart
from LCDT or Rambert Dance: Lloyd Newson's DV8; Phoenix Dance; Kim
Brandstrup's Arc Dance (with no subsidy), Laurie Booth and Russell
Maliphant, Yolande Snaith, all produce fine work. Other enterprises merely
debase the dance currency.
I could discern no merit in Claire Russ's Heirs and Graces, which was
Britain's contribution to Tuesday's workshop. The given theme for the
productions was 'Removals'. Miss Russ and her two companions offered a study
in family life notable for its thin dance ideas and its reliance upon
costume rather than action. Like so much of the new choreography (a word I
use with reluctance on occasions like this) Miss Russ proposed something
nearer to amateur dramatics than dance. So did France's Christine Marneffe,
whose J'aimerais tant rester looked like a film noir in serious trouble.
Minimal steps; good lighting; two couples and dislocated activities were the
ingredients. A bunch of carrots was lowered from the light-boom at one
moment: very puzzling, since we had not ordered vegetables.
Incomprehensible, and tiresome.
From Belgium came Veerle Bakelants with an exercise for three girls. They
wore little green coveralls, and rushed about while Glenn Gould's piano
arrangement of Richard Strauss's early violin sonata was played. That the
dance ideas (debased ballet steps and a lot of falls) were exhausted after a
few minutes meant that one could concentrate on Gould's pianism. Germany's
Urs Dietrich emerged with some credit from the evening. His duet with Thomas
Stich was a summer incident, set to bird-song, in which the two men indulged
in games - ah, the joys of mime] - and, I expect, were supposed to be
courting. Ho hum. But both chaps are fine dancers.
This Dance Workshop has support from the European Community. How much better
were it if the Commission made possible an exchange of major troupes around
Europe. It might, perish the thought, encourage audiences (and
choreographers) to understand dance as an enriching experience rather than
as therapy for the inadequate and the inexpert.

TOM AND JERRY THE MOVIE (U) Phil Roman
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES 3 (PG) Stuart Gillard

PUERTO ESCONDIDO (15) Gabriele Salvatores
The RSPCA - Royal Society for the Protection of Cartoon Animals - should be
out in force this week. Tom And Jerry The Movie and Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles 3 subject a cat, a mouse and four half-shell humanoids to
indignities more frightful than the worst we ever visited on our own pets.
Even small children would draw the line at stretching their favourite doggy
or moggy on a Procrustean rack. But the cinema thinks nothing of taking
beasties who originated in short, sprightly cartoons (Tom and Jerry) or
comic-strips (Turtles) and extending them sinew by creaking sinew into
feature length and/or triple sequelitis.
The Andrews Theory on this goes as follows. Hollywood cannot understand the
concept of small. If something is small and successful, the laws of nature
are being broken and that item must be made large and successful. If a
Hollywood mogul found a Faberge egg on his desk he would, with righteous
artistic indignation, set about turning it into a geodesic dome.
Tom And Jerry The Movie is 90 mirthless minutes in which the feline and
rodent who once gladdened our hearts by chasing each other round the
booby-trapped ideal homes of America - showing the Id alive even within the
suburban Super-Ego - cosy up together to rescue an orphan girl (sic) and
tearfully to reunite her with her missing father (etiam sic). It is as if
Tom and Jerry had wandered into a lost Lillian Gish movie. Not even the
film's two best turns - a suave, George Sanders-accented villain and a
skateboarding dog - can stop all hands going down with the ice-floe.
Turtles 3 is something stranger, eerier. Is conceptual stupidity becoming an
elemental force in modern cinema? The four shell-backed heroes who delight
in pizzas and New York slang (actually more like LA Valleyspeak migrated to
Manhattan) are here teleported to 17th century Japan. Here there is no pizza
supplier; no encouraging environment for cries of 'Excellent]' or
'Cowabunga]' (though of course everyone speaks English); and no sign of a
plot worth the name in writer-director Stuart Gillard's script about
time-hopping Samurai.
I came closer to something resembling an after-death experience with this
film than with any other I remember seeing. A tunnel of blackness seemed to
open up, followed by unearthly choirs singing of a luminous dimension in
which the movie would end and one would find celestial quarantine from lines
like 'I'll melt you into a steaming puddle of puke' or from watching four
amphibians dance, fight, crack jokes and fall over.
Like last week's Last Action Hero, TMNT3 is dementedly self-referential and
cine-referential. Note the turtle who rescues a child from a burning
building and cracks 'Eat your heart out, Kurt Russell' (see Backdraft, Act
2, Scene 3). But unlike the amiable Arnie adventure, it is less postmodern
than pushbutton-Pavlovian. If nothing else will trick the filmgoer's mouth
into a grin, goes the makers' thinking, perhaps we can try the tired
invocation of rival filmic favourites. But in a context this arch and
involuted already, Hell, as Jean-Paul Sartre once almost observed, is other
movies.
The Snapper, directed by Stephen Frears from Roddy Doyle's script of his own
novel, has nothing to do with turtles: except by psycho-behavioural analogy.
When, if you are a single Dublin 20-year-old (Tina Kellegher) made pregnant
by an older married man, should you stick your head out from under your
shell and tell your family?
If you do, Mum will make silent gaping motions like a distraught guppy.
Younger sister, wearing shaving-cream beard and toy soldier costume, will
carry on her Ruritanian bandleader practice. And Dad will go comprehensively
spare: spluttering patriarchally one moment, rushing to the library the next
to swot up sex-and-birth manuals.
Already shown on television by the BBC (who produced it), The Snapper now
gets a late cinematic Caesarean and bursts into the larger light of the
movie screen. It is not quite happy there. The TV-movie's natural foetal
postures - cramped framing, sitcom comic set-ups, close-knit gossip sessions
between Sharon and her chums at the pub - get scared by all the new space
around them. And author Doyle, who had a proper movie birth in the
all-singing-and-dancing The Commitments, must here cleave more prosaically
to his original story's straight and narrow.
But you cannot fault Colm Meaney's performance as Dad, which alone eats up
all space available to it. This paterfamilias has no idea how to react to an
unravelling domestic world, so he tries every different reaction in turn.
Anger; sorrow; bewilderment; scientific research; denial. ('The uterus is
pressing into my bladder' says the girl. 'Stop it, Sharon, I don't want to
hear things like that.') Finally, he just tries being himself and the Meaney
face - a comic chunk of wood with features nervously chipped into it - warms
into a glow of fatherly compassion as touching as it is well-observed and
unsentimental.
Nuit Et Jour is a readimix French art movie for those who are too young ever
to have seen the real thing. (The country virtually stopped making them
years ago.) Cabbie Jack (Thomas Langmann) loves pretty gamine Julie
(Guillaine Londez) and they live in a Paris flat big on colour co-ordination
and small on social life. ('Perhaps we ought to meet someone,' he suggests.
'Next year,' she replies). Their amour and bonheur are, however, enough for
them. As the voice-over crooningly if runically explains, 'They used to make
love almost in their sleep and that 'almost' was very important.'
The voice-over is female and the film was written and directed by the
once-reckonable Chantal Akerman (Jeanne Dielmann, Toute Une Nuit). But the
poor woman has obviously been knocked on the head by a pile of women's
magazines falling from her overcrowded bookshelf. This winsome nonsense
might have been penned by Sylvie Krin with a little help - for what is a
French film without pretension? - from Marguerite Duras. I especially winced
at the scene where an interior wall is knocked down on the grounds that
'everything will then be clearer'.
Ah, possibly. But then again perhaps not. These characters would not
recognise clarity if it jumped up and bit them. Outside the window is a
painted backdrop of Paris: so Pirandellian. Inside, the blue pillows are set
off against red floral wallpaper to match the lovers' own two-tone clothing
(he blue, she red). And when Julie succumbs to a fling with another man,
Jack's fellow cabbie Joseph, we start wandering about a Paris that resembles
a vast Toytown film noir.
For this is the world of designer existentialism. Here moods, emotions and
sexual identities are defined by playblock colours and pinbright symbolism:
that sort of sophisticated naivete, winking even as it dispenses wisdom,
that came in and should have gone straight out again with Les Parapluies de
Cherbourg.
In a difficult week you might try Italy's Puerto Escondido, written and
directed by Gabriele Salvatores. As in Signor S's Mediterraneo, a small
group of characters seek a world out of time but find time and and the world
catching up with them. Banker Mario (Diego Abantuono) flees Milan for
Mexico, to escape a homicidal police commissioner who took a mysterious
pot-shot at him in the bank's loo.
But malefactors turn friendly. (As Mediterraneo pointed out, our only true
enemy is ourselves). Soon the smiling cop comes West to join Mario's other
new friend, a crook who robbed him and then befriended him. And added to the
genially self-destructive mix are a girl (Valeria Golino), a bedraggled
fighting cock called Tyson and a storyline so picaresque it makes Don
Quixote seem like a O Henry story. Very slow but very (if you have the time)
engaging.

After the discrediting of the welfare state in the last few years, it would
be no great surprise to hear politicians calling for the reinstatement of
the Magdalen Institutes. In these houses for 'fallen women', founded in the
19th century, the inmates worked in laundries to earn their keep. In the
BBC2 documentary Washing Away The Stain (7.30) one inhabitant says: 'We
never got paid for any of the work . . . but we did get a cake of highland
toffee on a Sunday.'
The following programme, Business Matters (8.00) looks at the work of Robert
Schaffer who claims that most organisations perform at a fraction of their
true capabilities. Two examples where performance has been improved -
Wandsworth Borough Council and Betterware - are investigated.
BBC Proms - Live from the Albert Hall on BBC1 and Radio 3 (10.00) features
the Virtuosi di Roma playing music by Boccherini and Vivaldi.
Let's hope Deborah Kermode's documentary about budding comedians in the
series Metroland is as good as last week's about vans and their drivers
(10.40 ITV).

FT  05 AUG 93 / Arts: Kreizberg Prom - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A young musician would be hard put to find a more receptive audience than at
the Proms (the BBC Proms, as the programmes proudly remind us this year). At
Tuesday's concert both the conductor and the soloist can be counted class of
1986 or '87, the years in which they respectively won major music
competitions.
The Russian conductor Yakov Kreizberg won the Leopold Stokowski Conducting
Competition in 1986. In Britain he is best known for his Glyndebourne debut
with Janacek's Jenufa, widely counted a notable success. 'Sensational' was
one description trailed in the Proms prospectus, but quite misleadingly so,
as it turned out. Whatever other strong characteristics he displayed, a
taste for sensation was not among them.
It is tempting to plot a course showing how Tchaikovsky interpretation has
changed in Russia since the war. The start would be Mravinsky, impassioned,
volatile, always on the brink of hysteria; then Svetlanov, the master
showman, making the symphonies highly-charged melodramas. But it seems the
younger generation do not see Tchaikovsky in that way, as Valery Gergiev's
cultured performances have already suggested.
Kreizberg conducted the Sixth Symphony at his Prom - once the ultimate
invitation to indulge the emotions, but not here. The performance was crisp,
rhythmical, underplayed. Where conductors used to throw caution to the
winds, even if balance and ensemble flew out of control too, Kreizberg kept
a firm grip on every detail. So clear and decisive were his intentions that
it was surprising the BBC Symphony Orchestra's playing was not sharper
still. Where his view of the symphony impressed, it did so by clarity of
thought and understatement.
A clean, purposeful, classical style also provided the orchestral foundation
for Chopin's Second Piano Concerto with Vladimir Ovchinikov (the 1987
prizewinner at Leeds). No dawdling was allowed, or any indulgent
self-communing, but that probably suited Ovchinikov, who likes to hit every
note with crystal clarity, just touching in the poetry of the music.
As though to make youth feature in each item on the programme, the evening
had begun with Rakhmaninov's early Spring cantata. In later life the
composer was to look back with disdain on his orchestration in this score,
but it was difficult to see why in Kreizberg's expressive, never indulgent
performance. The BBC Symphony Chorus enunciated the Russian text with
diligent clarity and David Wilson-Johnson sang well as the bass soloist, who
is saved from murdering his adulterous wife by the arrival of Spring.
Knowing that Shalyapin was the original singer does, however, put a very
different gloss on the work.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Here' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD

<TEXT>
Here is a sample from Here. It comes from the opening scene when a young
couple is considering renting a flat in what seems remarkably like
Cambridge.
Phil. I think we need to think about this.
Cath. We are thinking about it.
Phil. We are thinking about it?
Cath. Aren't we?
Phil. What - seriously thinking about it?
Cath. Not seriously thinking about it. Just thinking about it.
And so it goes on. The trouble with Michael Frayn's new play is that we have
been here before. This is the land of linguistics and the meaning of
meaning. Some of the exchanges are even more banal or, if you like, more
profound: for example, the endlessly repeated 'What? 'Nothing' 'You mean
 .?' 'No'. Odd how such educated people can become so inarticulate, which I
suppose is the point of the piece.
Is it funny? Yes, a bit, intermittently, for about five minutes. It is
curious how the English language allows phrases like 'as a matter of fact'
to have two meanings: one a casual remark, the other an attempted statement
of truth. The same goes for 'as it happens'.
As it happens, in fact, quite the best parts of the play come when the
linguistic cleverness is abandoned and Phil behaves like a spoiled child or
an ordinary bullying male rather than the over-trained Cambridge
post-graduate, which one assumes is what he is. There is rather a touching
scene where he and Cath wear the same sweater and try to behave as one
person; another where Cath shows her prowess at wrestling.
The best part of the lot, however, belongs neither to Iain Glen's Phil nor
to Teresa Banham's Cath, but to Brenda Bruce as the landlady. Ms Bruce talks
as if she has never heard of Wittgenstein, and is all the better for it. Her
comic role is to enter whenever the couple is about to make love. Yet later
on she has a long speech of her own about her late husband Eric. She shows
that she knows all about the concept of space and which side of the bed is
whose from her own marriage: there is no need to philosophise about it in
pretentious terms. Ms Bruce has a wonderfully graphic line about Eric
'putting on a special holy look like Jesus picking up the cross' when he had
to get out the tool box to mend the door handle only to find there were no
screws in the tin. When Frayn writes like this, he is a very effective
playwright.
There is another oddity about Here which one can only take to be deliberate.
The subject of finance is never mentioned, not even when the couple are
thinking about moving into the flat and at the end of the play move on to
another with an extra room. No source of income is ever divulged. One knew
that Cambridge was abstract, but to omit money altogether is surely to miss
a trick or two in the writing. There might at least have been a theory about
it.
Towards the end, there is an attempted moment of drama when Phil suddenly
breaks down and says 'Oh Cath, I'm so miserable'. No matter; he is quickly
back in the old linguistic routine. The theme must be his intellectual
boredom, but the problem with intellectual boredom is that it is quite
difficult to portray on stage without being - well, you know what I mean.

FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Cunningham moves to UBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Adrian Cunningham, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, is moving
across to UBS where he becomes senior currency economist. He will report to
Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research, and replaces Avinash
Persaud who departed for JP Morgan at the end of June.
With the virtual collapse of the ERM, there is plenty of scope for currency
forecasters to shine at present. Coincidentally or not, recent months have
seen a brisk trade in economists in general between a number of City
institutions.
Cunningham, 31, has spent four years at B of A, which is ranked tenth in
interbank foreign exchange and 12th in currency dealings on behalf of
customers, according to Euromoney. UBS ranks third for interbank
transactions, but ninth for customers. Jeremy Hawkins, B of A's chief
economic adviser in London, says he and Cunningham have been 'reasonably
bearish' as regards the fate of the ERM over the past six months.
Before his stint at B of A, Cunningham was the Reserve Bank of Australia's
economist in London for a couple of years. In a rather unusual path to the
City's frenetic dealing rooms, he had previously graduated from Leicester
Poly, taken an MA in economics at Manchester University, worked for South
Glamorgan Health Authority and then taught economics to A-level and Oxbridge
candidates at Portsmouth grammar school.

FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Heaps steps up at Britannia BSoc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Heaps, 54, the new managing director of Britannia Building Society, the
country's ninth biggest, says that his new job is not as big a step as it
looks.
He has been deputy managing director since October 1991 and as his boss,
Michael Shaw, has been chairman of the Building Societies Association, Heaps
has been running the society as the effective chief operating officer.
Shaw, who is expected to retire next year, has been appointed executive vice
chairman and will continue to be chairman of Britannia Life, one of the UK's
fastest growing life companies with assets of over Pounds 1.5bn. Although
Heaps stresses the continuity of management style, he is likely to adopt a
higher public profile than Shaw.
In addition, whereas Shaw had an accountancy background, Heaps has come up
through the administration and information technology sides of the business.
He was chief executive of Colne Building Society until it was bought by
Britannia in 1983.

FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Geest zips up Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geest, the fruit and produce group which slipped on a banana skin earlier
this year, has hired an expert to run its banana business: Bob Fisher, 55,
currently chief operating officer of Pacific Fruit Co (Noboa), an
international banana group, and formerly president of Dole, another banana
company.
Fisher, an American, joins Geest as managing director of Geest Banana Sector
on September 1, two months after the new EC banana regime came into force.
It was dumping of bananas in northern Europe ahead of the new regime which
squashed banana prices and caused Geest to warn on interim profits at its
annual meeting in May. Although continental banana prices have recently
taken a turn for the better and Geest's shares have recovered of late, the
interim results next month are expected to be gruesome.
At the same time, Geest is merging its slim-line main board with the
management board. Stuart Anderson, Peter Macielinski and Douglas McGrath,
members of the management board, are joining the main board and the
management board is being disbanded. Geest has also attracted Jim Maxmin
(above), chief executive of Laura Ashley, the fashion and home furnishings
manufacturer and retailer, as a non-executive director.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Management: The man with no name - Bernard Simon on a
Canadian retailer's crusade to outsell established brands with generic
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A glance at the bank of computer screens in Dave Nichol's Toronto office is
enough to appreciate how the power in North American supermarkets is
shifting away from brand-name groceries.
With a few clicks of his mouse, Nichol, president of Loblaw International
Merchants, the marketing arm of Canada's biggest food retailer, calls up the
latest weekly, brand-by-brand sales of ketchup in 200 Loblaw stores across
Ontario.
The top performer, as is the case most weeks, is President's Choice,
Loblaw's own brand. Products made by HJ Heinz, the name synonymous with
ketchup, are bunched further down the list.
The rows of data on the computer screen also explain Loblaw's determination
to keep things that way. Every penny of profit from ketchup sales during
this particular week came from President's Choice products. The average
margin on Heinz and other manufacturers' brands was negative.
Nichol and his colleagues are in the forefront of a 'brand-busting' crusade.
Their confidence stems from signs that shoppers around the world are
deserting the products promoted by powerful manufacturers, such as Procter &amp;
Gamble, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Nestle, in favour of
high-quality but cheaper brands controlled by retailers.
Retailer-controlled brands are known by various names, including generic,
private label and no-name. What they have in common is that their pricing,
shelf space and promotion are entirely in the hands of the retailer, not the
manufacturer.
Nichol is among those predicting doom and gloom for the old-style,
manufacturer-controlled brands, also known in North America as national
brands.
In a fiery speech, which he delivers every few weeks somewhere in North
America, he maintains that food manufacturers are facing a 'brand tax
revolt' as consumers 'slash away at all their traditional shopping habits to
get better value for their money. Massive, bloated marketing and advertising
budgets (are) designed to disguise the fact that (national brands) are
nothing more than commodities masquerading as unique products'.
Nichol predicts that 'retailer-controlled brand penetration in excess of 40
per cent is inevitable in the US. Traditional food retailers who do not
achieve these levels in the next 10 years will not survive'.
In creating their own brands, Nichol and his boss, Richard Currie, president
of Loblaw Companies, the parent organisation, readily acknowledge their debt
to such European retailers as Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury in the UK, and
France's Carrefour.
Loblaw has recruited managers from M&amp;S's Canadian subsidiary, as well as
from South Africa's Woolworths (not related to the FW Woolworth group),
whose products and marketing strategies are closely modelled on M&amp;S.
Retailer brands have a far higher market share in Europe than in North
America. Saturation advertising on US television helped boost consumer
awareness of national brands in the 1960s and 1970s. Furthermore, the food
retailing business is more fragmented in North America and for many years
the manufacturer has held the balance of power.
European retailers are still widely admired for their product development.
But the struggle to take market share away from national brands has given
North American chains such as Loblaw the edge in marketing and promotion. 'I
don't know whether anyone can match Dave Nichol as a salesman,' says George
Rosenbaum, president of Leo Shapiro &amp; Associates, a Chicago market research
company.
Loblaw's biggest breakthrough was the campaign that propelled President's
Choice Decadent chocolate-chip cookies past a Nabisco product to become
Canada's most popular biscuit. President's Choice overtook Nabisco by using
butter instead of shortening, putting in 50 per cent more chocolate chips,
and selling at a lower price.
The achievement is especially remarkable because President's Choice products
are available at only about one-fifth of the supermarkets that stock Nabisco
brands.
Loblaw's success in chocolate-chip cookies has wider implications. 'If you
want to buy Canada's best-selling cookie, you have to come to one of our
stores,' Nichol says. 'When you have 100 unique products that have a
franchise like the Decadent and are available only in your store, you're
unbeatable.'
One of Loblaw's most effective marketing tools is its 16-page Insider's
Report, inserted in newspapers across Canada three or four times a year. The
report advertises dozens of President's Choice products with the help of
cartoons, a friendly, informal text and large slabs of yellow highlights on
each page. Loblaw estimates that each edition of the Insider's Report
generates sales of CDollars 30m-CDollars 50m (Pounds 15.60m-Pounds 26.00m).
Nichol also appears as the face of President's Choice in television and
radio ads. Unlike most manufacturers, however, Loblaw has no outside
advertising agency and uses its own studio. According to Nichol, the company
produces its President's Choice television commercials for less than
CDollars 10,000 apiece - a fraction of the cost of an ad for a typical
national brand such as Coca-Cola.
Loblaw recently started selling President's Choice recipe videos and has
begun publishing an Insider's Report cook book, in which all the recipes
have at least one President's Choice product as an essential ingredient.
The success of President's Choice in Canada has led Loblaw to start
exporting its product-development and marketing expertise. It has helped
Wal-Mart, the big US retailer, launch a variety of Sam's American Choice
groceries, and other US chains sell products under the President's Choice
label. Coles Myer, the largest Australian food retailer, last month
introduced Australia's Choice snacks, juices and cookies (including
Decadent). President's Choice products will appear on the shelves of Hong
Kong's Park 'n Shop chain later this year.
These chains pay Loblaw a development fee. Currie and Nichol decline to
reveal how much, beyond saying that it is far below what any retailer would
pay to develop its own brands from scratch.
These licensing agreements are the start of what Nichol predicts will be a
growing web of international alliances among retailers, determined to weaken
manufacturers' influence on supermarket marketing and pricing strategies.
Loblaw and its licensees in the US and Australia are co-ordinating their
orders this Christmas for several million dollars of chocolate-covered
biscuits from Delacre, a Belgian manufacturer. The chances are that they
have extracted much better terms by pooling their purchases than any one of
the companies could have negotiated by itself.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Profitable tune from
commercial radio - As stations win more listeners the task now is to woo
advertisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Douglas McArthur, a former brand manager at Procter &amp; Gamble, has been given
the task of reversing a marketing disaster of classic proportions.
The problem is that the brand has been getting 'better' all the time - 50
per cent in the past 10 years according to McArthur - yet its market share
had scarcely increased at all.
The 'brand' is commercial radio in the UK and McArthur is managing director
of the Radio Advertising Bureau, the biggest effort made so far by the
commercial radio industry - now 20 years old - to promote itself as an
advertising medium.
The challenge he faces is to try to translate the growth in listening as new
stations have come on air into extra advertising revenue.
There are now more than 100 individual commercial radio services in the UK
and two national stations, Classic FM and Virgin. In addition, Atlantic 252,
the
pop station based in Ireland, reaches 60 per cent of the UK population.
McArthur's 'marketing disaster' is that commercial radio is still stuck at
around 2 per cent mark of total advertising revenue. The causes are partly
historical. Commercial radio followed commercial television in the UK and
has remained in its shadow.
Many national advertisers have simply ignored the medium, a process not
helped by squabbling stations concentrating on short-term advantage and
giving little thought to the longer-term promotion of their medium.
'We have discovered an immense amount of valuable, persuasive data for
radio. The duty is on the industry to tell people. Advertisers just don't
know about the benefits of radio,' says McArthur. 'Advertisers views on
radio are rooted in guesses made many years ago and the industry has never
made the time to tell them.'
This week the Radio Advertising Bureau, which is funded by a group of major
stations, went on the offensive using the latest official listening figures
as ammunition.
At a press conference McArthur was able to announce that for the first time
commercial radio had taken a 40 per cent share of the audience in its battle
with the long-entrenched and substantially funded local, regional and
national radio services of the BBC.
It was a symbolic moment even though to get to the 40 per cent mark in the
three months from March to June, McArthur had to add in the 2.2 per cent
share of listening won by Virgin 1215, the new national pop station, which
had only been on air for seven weeks of the research period.
McArthur was also able to point out that the reach of commercial radio, the
number of people who listen at least once a week, had climbed to a record 60
per cent including Virgin.
In London, where the choice ranges from easy listening and jazz to various
tones of pop plus news and talk, commercial radio took a 58 per cent share
of the audience.
While RAB claims that the commercial stations now have a stranglehold on the
BBC go a little too far, McArthur was able to point to information about BBC
listeners who hear their radio uninterrupted by advertising.
Some 41 per cent of the those who listen to the Today programme on BBC Radio
4 also listen to commercial radio and fans of The Archers (also on Radio 4)
behave in a similar way.
Radio, at least in the morning, can compete effectively against television.
At 8am, RAB points out, two and a half times more people are listening to
commercial radio than are watching commercial television.
Despite the good news, McArthur believes there is only a brief window of
opportunity for the radio industry to 'really go for bust' and persuade
advertisers to re-assess commercial radio in the wake of publicity
surrounding the launch of the new national stations Classic and Virgin.
Apart from trumpeting the latest audience numbers during its first year, RAB
has set up specialist teams to advise new advertisers to radio and assembled
research including more than 200 case studies of successful use of radio as
an advertising medium.
Within three years McArthur would like to add Pounds 50m in revenue to
current commercial radio revenues of Pounds 150m. In a largely fixed-cost
business that would mean Pounds 40m straight to the bottom line.
'Radio will not be a huge medium in three years. It will have a 3 per cent
share of advertising. But stations will be immensely profitable and none of
the other media will have noticed because an extra 1 per cent is a tiny
share of anything,' he says.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Technology: Digital assistant is of limited help - Apple's
MessagePad is a revolutionary computer but could struggle to find a useful
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer's Newton MessagePad 'personal digital assistant' finally made
its official debut this week, more than a year after John Sculley, the
company's chairman, began promoting the device as the focal point for the
convergence of computer, communications and consumer electronics technology.
'We believe that Newton will be seen as the defining technology of the
digital age,' Sculley said at the launch of the computer in Boston. He
predicted a technology revolution in the 1990s that would overshadow the
personal computer revolution of the 1980s.
With such a build-up it is perhaps inevitable that the Newton MessagePad
will fall short of expectations, even though it is an innovative device that
brings a whole new meaning to the term personal computing.
A 1lb-tablet, about the size of a video cassette, the MessagePad is operated
with a pen stylus, which can be used to jot notes on a three-inch by
four-inch screen or to point to icons representing specific functions.
What sets the Newton apart from other hand-held or even desktop personal
computers is its ability to learn a user's work habits. From the style of
their handwriting to the format they like to use for business letters, their
favourite lunch spot and most frequently called clients or colleagues, the
MessagePad learns, over time, to adapt to its user's preferences.
Where the computer disappoints, however, is in its communications
capabilities. Originally billed as a wireless personal communicator, the
basic model of the MessagePad lacks even a built-in modem. Wireless
communications capabilities are limited to short-range transmissions using
infra-red beams. Pointed towards another MessagePad up to about three feet
away, the device can send or receive messages. A suitably equipped Apple
Macintosh or other PC can also exchange data with a Newton.
Apple executives suggest that such transmissions may be a good way to swap
business card information with other Newton users electronically, or
silently exchange thoughts with a business colleague during a meeting.
Yet this seems to be a technology that is searching for a useful
application.
Wireless paging and messaging services will be available for US users of the
MessagePad soon, Apple promises. With the addition of a plug-in device
offered by Motorola, the MessagePad will act as a pocket pager, albeit a
more bulky one than the matchbox-sized devices that many business people
wear on their belts.
With the addition of another plug-in module, the MessagePad can send - but
not receive - facsimile messages when plugged into a telephone line. Newton
will also have its own international electronic mail system, at 'a later
date'. NewtonMail will be a subscriber-based, 'cost-effective' service,
Apple says.
Eventually, the service will be expanded to offer information services such
as news, weather and financial data, although it is hard to imagine that
such data could be displayed to advantage on the MessagePad's tiny screen.
The MessagePad will be available throughout the US over the next few weeks
and from next month in the UK. Non-English versions will follow next year,
Apple says. Prices have not been fixed but Apple expects it to sell in the
US for Dollars 699-Dollars 949 (Pounds 469-Pounds 636) depending on
configuration.
As with any new computer, the availability of applications software will be
critical to the value of the MessagePad. Despite widespread activity among
independent software developers the must-have application for the Newton has
yet to emerge. Programs announced this week range from specialised systems
for estate agents to titles for sports enthusiasts.
Apple has announced six of its own software titles for Newton, including
interactive maps of US cities, a reference guide to the Fortune 500, the
business magazine's league table of the largest US companies, and games.
Most would be better suited to larger-screen laptop computers.
Who will buy the Newton MessagePad? Apple is initially targeting technology
enthusiasts as well as corporate buyers who could use the device as part of
their information technology systems. Coca-Cola, Monsanto and American
Express are among early customers, Apple says. However, market analysts do
not expect the MessagePad to be a big seller. Sales projections range from
Dollars 50m to Dollars 300m over the next 12 months.
Whether or not the Newton is a hit, it has defined a new product category in
the personal computing field. Already Apple is hinting at improvements to
come in later versions. And, in a break with its usual practice, the company
is licensing its Newton technology to other companies. Current licensees
include Sharp and Matsushita Electric of Japan, and Motorola of the US.
Sharp, which is manufacturing the MessagePad for Apple, also introduced its
own very similar 'Expert Pad' this week. Rolm, a US telecommunications
equipment subsidiary of Siemens, will be incorporating Newton technology
into a new product called the NotePhone.
Eventually, Newton technology may indeed 'change the world' as Apple
predicts, but it is unlikely to be an immediate success.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Technology: Software's secret war - US computer companies
are at odds with the government over data security plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle over computer data security standards has erupted in the US, with
private industry and the government at odds over the most effective way to
protect information that flows through large networks of computers.
A group of companies led by Novell, the network software company, is
attempting to set a new data security standard, while the US government is
getting little industry support for its 'Clipper chip' proposal for voice
and data security, which was introduced in April.
The key to protecting computer networks from unauthorised access by computer
hackers and spies lies in the use of data encryption technologies.
Encryption also offers individuals much-needed data privacy that can protect
their electronic communications and their bank accounts.
Novell says its proposal is based on a more sophisticated data encryption
technology than the government's Clipper system, and is better suited to
computer networks.
The company has formed a coalition consisting of 22 users and vendors to
define a reliable data security system. Coalition members include Brian
Gladman, senior procurement manager at the UK Ministry of Defence, and
Herman Roos, a partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick in the Netherlands.
The government's Clipper technology is based on a secret encryption method
developed by the National Security Agency and adopted by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). But there is concern within
industry that the Clipper encryption technology has a secret 'trapdoor' that
would allow the NSA to decipher messages. The NSA denies that the trapdoor
exists but will not reveal the Clipper encryption algorithm.
In June more than 50 organisations united to criticise the government's
endorsement of Clipper. Members of that group included AT&amp;T, IBM, Apple
Computer, MCI and public interest groups Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
CPSR and the EFF say that allowing law enforcement agencies to snoop on
communications violates individual privacy rights. And they complain that
keeping the encryption method secret could leave systems open to attack by
computer hackers who might stumble upon a way to crack the encryption
algorithm.
Communications companies also say that Clipper is too slow. 'We need a data
security system that can keep up with high-speed networks,' says Charles
Hart, president of Semaphore Communications, a data security company based
in Aptos, California.
Novell proposes using a system based on the IBM-developed Data Encryption
Standard (DES) and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption method,
considered almost unbreakable.
The RSA encryption method relies on the product of two large prime numbers
and the use of keys - special numbers to encode and decipher messages. Users
have a public and private key. To send a message, the file is encrypted with
the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. Only the intended
recipient can decode the message.
RSA Data Security, which licenses the RSA encryption technology, claims it
would take supercomputers running for hundreds of years to decode encrypted
messages.
Glenn Hyatt, head of data security consultants HighGate Solutions in
Wilmington, Delaware, says: 'There is an important need among large
corporations for a reliable data security model. Novell is the right company
to co-ordinate this since their software is a de facto standard in
networks.'
Despite the protests the US government is expected to press ahead with
Clipper after the proposal's review period ends in October.
Officials at the NSA and NIST insist that while Clipper is likely to become
a government standard its use by the private sector will be voluntary.
However, US government procurement effectively sets standards that private
industry - especially those companies that do business with the government -
will be forced to follow.
Even as a standard for government computing, Clipper sets a dangerous
precedent, warns Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of the
CPSR. 'We believe that privacy protection is important for building a
national communications infrastructure and Clipper does not provide that
privacy.'
Rotenberg is also suspicious that new laws could force private companies and
individuals to provide a way for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to tap
into encrypted communications systems. The FBI has been trying to gain
support in Congress for the passage of the digital telephony bill, which
will force companies producing communcations equipment to give easy access
to FBI wire-taps.
'The government says that Clipper's use will be voluntary, but if the FBI
succeeds with its digital telephony bill it could make Clipper's use
mandatory,' Rotenberg says.
The FBI claims that criminals using encryption technologies make it
impossible for the bureau to conduct wire-taps. However, the CPSR says the
agency has not yet shown that a single investigation has been hampered
through criminals using encrypted communications.
The computer industry fears that such initiatives will force companies to
adopt weaker data security measures than those available to foreign
competitors.
While US companies are permitted to use whatever encryption technology they
want, there are restrictions on the export of computer products.
'For every export order, we have to obtain special permission from the
Department of Commerce,' says Bill Ferguson, vice-president of sales and
marketing at Semaphore. 'This paperwork takes about two months to complete,
even to countries in western Europe. Our competitors abroad don't have these
restrictions.'
The Software Publishers Association, which represents more than 1,000 US
software companies, has also complained to the government that export
controls on software containing encryption features are harming the software
industry.
At a hearing organised in early June by the NIST, the association's general
counsel, Ilene Rosenthal, testified: 'Unilateral US export controls do not
make any sense given the widespread legal availability of foreign encryption
programs.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Litigation battle spreads to more than
one front in US - Richard Lapper explains why accountants are increasingly
concerned about 'illogical' legal burdens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THERE IS really only one issue affecting accountants worth writing about:
the litigation crisis', the US journalist Thomas La Freniere was told during
a routine interview with a leading US accountant.
La Freniere, the former editor of International Accounting Bulletin and
himself a former accountant, took the advice. The result - 18 months on - is
The Litigation Nightmare, published this week by Dublin-based Lafferty
Publications, and one of the most complete accounts of the mounting legal
threat to accountants.
In a 300-page report, La Freniere details the extent of a burden described
by Mr Richard Murray, the chairman and chief executive of Minet Global
Professional Services, the insurance broker, 'as the most illogical faced by
any business'.
'The threat of litigation has taken on new dimensions,' says La Freniere in
his introduction to the report. Legal trends in the United States mean that
accountants are 'held responsible for much more than obvious malpractice. A
disturbing trend has arisen which would make them guarantors of good
management judgment,' says La Freniere.
In the US, where most legal actions have concentrated, the big six
accountancy firms have faced a steady rise in legal costs, as creditors and
investors in troubled and insolvent companies seek to recover losses.
The costs incurred in fighting and defending legal actions rose by at least
25 per cent to an amount equivalent to 12 per cent of total accounting and
auditing revenues in the 1992 financial year. This followed an 18 per cent
increase in 1991 to Dollars 404m, an amount equivalent to 9 per cent of
total revenues.
The figures show that 10 of the 12 settlements involve pay-outs of Dollars
20m or more. Four of the cases related to a Dollars 400m settlement by Ernst
&amp; Young when it was sued by three US government bodies over the the failure
of US savings and loans institutions for which it had worked.
Other big settlements included a pay-out of nearly Dollars 150m against
Coopers &amp; Lybrand to the bondholders and bankruptcy trustees of Miniscribe,
a disk drive manufacturer, and a pay-out of Dollars 77.5m against KPMG Peat
Marwick, Deloitte Touche and 27 others to investors in Wedtech, a defence
contractor. Since many settlements are negotiated out of court and given
little publicity, the real cost and number of claims is much higher. La
Freniere says 1992 will 'likely go down as the worst year ever for
litigation against accountants'.
Worse still, the tide of litigation shows no signs of letting up.
Accountants face at least five claims worldwide where investors and
creditors or troubled or insolvent companies are seeking to recover more
than Dollars 1bn, three of them outside the US.
These include a claim for Dollars 8bn in damages by the liquidators of Bank
of Credit and Commerce International against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp;
Young and a claim for ADollars 1.1bn against KPMG Peat Marwick by the state
of Victoria in Australia.
Claims in the pipeline in the US include one for Dollars 158m against Peat
Marwick (Ballingary Mines and Flair Resources) - and a whole string of
Dollars 100m-plus claims stemming from the failures of the Savings and Loans
Associations. Internationally, claims are mounting in scope. La Freniere
says that accountancy firms in at least 50 countries have experienced one or
more claims. Firms in at least 20 further countries may have claims pending.
Outside the US, Australian accountants seem to be most heavily exposed.
'With more than ADollars 3bn in known claims there are about ADollars
160,000 worth of claims for each professional employed by the top 16 firms
in the country,' says La Freniere.
Although the level of liability in continental European countries is low,
the trend there is rising faster than in any other part of the world. Last
year, for example, French accountancy firms faced about 150 cases, twice as
many as in 1991. German accountants' liabilities are currently limited to
DM500,000, but as firms prepare financial statements for use abroad a
growing proportion of their work will fall outside the scope of this limit.
The report says that if all proposed legislation and regulation in the
European Community is adopted, accountants practising in member states will
be subjected to the harshest rules anywhere that govern claims and
liability. Commenting on the incidence of a claim in South Korea, La
Freniere says: 'The problems seem to be spreading from the Anglo-influenced
countries to places where one would think the likelihood for litigation
would be small.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / Accountancy Column: Taxing season awaits many football clubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTBALL CLUBS could be pushed to the brink of bankruptcy unless they take
immediate action to sort out their tax affairs, a report by Touche Ross has
warned.
Touche says that the Inland Revenue has embarked upon a comprehensive review
of professional and semi-professional football, in the wake of the
successful prosecution of Swindon Town FC three years ago, writes Richard
Lapper.
After Swindon was found guilty of defrauding the Revenue, clubs were sent
warning circulars and two specialist units were set up to help clubs with
problems.
'The limbering up is over and the Revenue team is now in action,' says Mr
Richard Baldwin, partner with Touche Ross and author of the report.
'The Revenue's recent activity, which has received widespread media
attention, clearly indicates that clubs who have not had the taxman knocking
at the door should get their PAYE systems into order immediately because
they could be next on the list,' says Mr Baldwin.
'This is a big issue for all clubs and some could face demands for back
taxes and fines for tens of thousands of pounds,' adds Mr Baldwin. 'Some
settlements already agreed in semi-professional clubs have been in excess of
Pounds 50,000 but League and Premier League clubs could face bills for
hundreds of thousands of pounds. Few clubs are going to escape a visit from
the taxman.'
Danger areas for clubs include:
Cash payments to players and managers from which tax and national insurance
have not been deducted.
Payment of 'termination payments' for premature ending of a player's
contract which may be regarded by the Revenue as a disguised 'signing-on
fee'.
Payment of tax and national insurance for employees including match stewards
and gate attendants.
Receipt of expenses and benefits such as complimentary tickets, interest
free loans and cars to players, staff and directors.
Signing-on fees which the player waives with a corresponding payment into a
pension scheme by the club.
The report says that clubs must collect and account PAYE and national
insurance, as well as complete all relevant paper-work.
'Problems frequently arise in relation to payments made to match day staff
who may be designated as 'casuals' by the club but who are viewed as
employees by the tax office,' warns Mr Baldwin.
'If the PAYE and NIC has not been deducted then clubs could face bills going
back over a six-year period,' he adds.

FT  05 AUG 93 / BNF forecasts Pounds 1.8bn earnings from Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, will earn Pounds 950m
for the UK and at least Pounds 1.8bn for British Nuclear Fuels in its first
10 years, the company said yesterday.
Those are the central claims of the 50-page report published yesterday by
BNF which sets out the economic case for the plant. The government's second
public consultation on the future of the plant, which runs until October 4,
will focus on economic and diplomatic questions. It promises to be as stormy
as the first consultation, which ended in January, and which addressed only
environmental issues.
Environmental groups yesterday criticised the government for not
commissioning an independent study of the economic case for Thorp. They
argued that the plant's profitability is likely to be much lower than BNF's
figures suggest. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'The
documents published by the Department of the Environment do not demonstrate
that opening Thorp is in the best interests of the economy or the
environment.'
However, it was unclear yesterday how much consideration the government
intends to give to the responses to the consultation. Ministers made clear
that the decision to hold a second consultation was in response to the great
degree of public interest and was a matter of 'good governance'. However,
the government statement said that these wider economic and diplomatic
issues were 'not relevant' legally to the final decision.
Ministers said they are 'minded' to grant the plant a licence to start
operation on the basis of the first public consultation. The Pollution
Inspectorate, which published its conclusions from that consultation
yesterday, said it was satisfied that the proposed licence 'would
effectively protect human health, the safety of the food chain, and the
environment generally'.
In yesterday's report BNF put the cost of Thorp at Pounds 1.9bn, and at
Pounds 2.85bn including all associated facilities. The plant is intended to
take used or 'spent' nuclear fuel and recycle it so that re-usable uranium
and plutonium are extracted, leaving a smaller pile of unusable radioactive
waste.
The core of BNF's economic case is that Thorp will be worth about Pounds
950m to the UK in its first 10 years. This figure weighs the costs to the
country if Thorp were abandoned - loss of overseas revenue and storage costs
of nuclear fuel - against the savings. The estimate is in 1993 money - a
discount rate of 8 per cent, standard in government projects, has been used
to take account of the fact that much of the cost and revenue will not occur
for years.
According to Friends of the Earth, the projections 'are extremely sensitive
to changes in assumptions about costs'.
BNF's report identifies some factors which could diminish the value of Thorp
to the UK:
Doubling the costs of decommissioning the plant - which BNF has put at
Pounds 750m, or Pounds 1.2bn including all related facilities - would reduce
the value in 1993 money by some Pounds 30m.
Accelerating decommissioning by 15 years - perhaps because of insufficient
orders beyond the first 10 years - would cut off Pounds 10m. A 10-year delay
in starting the UK's proposed long-term underground store for radioactive
waste would cut off a further Pounds 10m. This project, run by UK Nirex, the
company owned by the UK nuclear industry, is currently scheduled to be ready
around the year 2007, but has been hit by delays.
Yet BNF argues that there is no reason to fear that the value of Thorp would
suffer from an overrun in general operating costs, even though the nuclear
industry has a poor record of overstepping its budget. In BNF's view, such
overruns are 'usually a feature of the construction phase'. It adds that
'even if there were to be unexpected operating cost increases, 60 per cent
could be passed through contractually to overseas customers'.
Critics of the proposals last night called for publication of the contracts,
without which, they said, it was impossible to judge that claim.
According to BNF, the estimate of Thorp's value is more likely to be too
low. In particular, it does not take account of the 'significant'
unemployment in Cumbria. BNF says that Thorp would support 5,450 jobs
directly and indirectly. A related plant to produce 'mixed oxide' fuel from
the reprocessed fuel, which cannot go ahead without Thorp, would support
3,000 construction jobs and 600 more in the long term, it said.
According to Pieda, UK-based economic consultants employed by BNF, the cost
to the UK of supporting redundant Thorp workers until they found equivalent
employment could add a further Pounds 500m to the value of Thorp to the UK.
The economic and commercial justification for Thorp - prepared by BNF.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Government announces changes for 25 franchises in BR
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced changes in the shape of three of the 25
franchises for passenger services to be offered when British Rail is
privatised, John Willman writes.
The changes affect the franchises for InterCity Cross Country, the central
division of Regional Railways and Regional Railways' long-distance
inter-urban services.
Services currently operated by more than one BR profit centre will be
assigned to the leading operator, under the final plans. This means that the
Euston-Northampton-Birmingham services, for example, will be included in the
franchise for Network SouthEast North.
Announcing the changes, Mr John MacGregor, secretary of state for transport,
said that the franchises would 'reflect regional identity and the aim of
providing better services for rail users'.

KAYTECH, one of the UK's largest independent computer retail chains, has
ceased trading and a creditors' meeting has been called for later this month
to vote on liquidation.
The Bromley-based group, run by Mr Tomas Kaczer, has stores in Southampton
and Manchester, and opened a computer 'superstore' in DH Evans in London's
Oxford Street in February.
Yesterday there was no reply from Kaytech's headquarters. Kaytech's
operations in DH Evans were closed. Callers were referred to a firm of
insolvency practitioners which confirmed that the group was no longer
trading and that a creditors' meeting had been called for August 20.
Kaytech is the latest casualty of the upheaval in personal computer
manufacturing and retailing markets.
Over the past six months a handful of small PC 'clone' manufacturers have
failed. This has prompted renewed predictions of a wave of consolidation
sweeping the industry.
Meanwhile independent PC retailers such as Kaytech have faced growing
competition. Most PC manufacturers have set up their own telephone-based
direct sales operations, while competition from high street stores and the
new breed of PC 'superstores' is growing.
Earlier this year Dixons acquired four 'PC World' superstores from Vision
Technology Group for Pounds 8.5m. Specialist Computer Holdings, another
independent computer sales group, announced plans earlier this week for a
nationwide chain of computer superstores.
SCS, a privately owned Birmingham-based group, said it plans to invest about
Pounds 40m over the next two years on a string of outlets.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Sell-off requires the right kind of leasing: Richard Tomkins
on how ministers aim to ensure a supply of new trains for a privatised
British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT SORT OF trains will passengers will be riding if the government's plans
for railway privatisation are fulfilled?
Optimists look forward to the day when private-sector franchisees, free of
the restraints on British Rail's capital spending, replace out-of-date
rolling stock with modern trains that passengers will like and use.
A gloomier view is that operators will simply take over existing trains from
BR and run them into the ground, grabbing as much profit as they can before
their franchises - and the trains - expire.
In theory it will make sense for private-sector train operators to invest in
new trains, for much the same reason as airlines invest in new aircraft or
shipping companies invest in new ships: to get their hands on the most
attractive and efficient machinery available, and make money.
But the difficulty with railway privatisation is the risk introduced by the
franchising process. Since most franchises are likely to last only about
seven years, private-sector operators will have little incentive to invest
in new trains because of the risk that the investment will be wasted if the
franchise is lost.
In the airline or shipping business, the loss of a franchise would not
matter as much because operators could recover the residual value of their
investment by selling their aircraft or ships on the second-hand market.
Trains tend to be custom-built for the lines they serve and are rarely much
use elsewhere, so no similar second-hand market exists.
The government hopes it can overcome this difficulty by creating a leasing
market for passenger rolling stock. That way, private-sector operators would
be able to lease trains for the duration of their franchises without the
fear of being stuck with them.
The first step would be to take all existing passenger trains (11,000
vehicles worth Pounds 2bn) and split them between three newly formed
rolling-stock companies - initially BR-owned, but later to be privatised.
Private-sector operators would lease trains from these three competing
companies for the duration of their franchises. If they lost a franchise at
renewal, the trains would revert to the rolling-stock company, which should
have a deep enough spread of risk and market share to absorb and redeploy
them.
More importantly, the government hopes that as privatisation progressed,
franchisees would become bolder and start ordering new rolling stock direct
from the manufacturers. Again, ministers are making the assumption that
franchisees would lease trains rather than buy them outright.
The problem is that lessors - typically the leasing arms of the big banks -
could prove reluctant to enter this market because they would fear being
lumbered with unwanted trains if lessees go bust or lose their franchises.
Acknowledging this potential pitfall, the Department of Transport has
published leasing proposals aimed at assuaging lessors' fears.
First, it promised that if a franchisee went bust, the franchising director
would keep up the payments on any rolling stock leases until a replacement
franchisee was found. Second, it said the franchising director would have
powers to order that new rolling stock be used on a given route from one
franchise period to the next, even if the franchise changed hands.
Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, hopes that with these measures
in place, lessors will be more enthusiastic about getting involved in the
rolling stock market. After all, he points out, trains typically have a
useful life of between 30 and 40 years, so if lessors recoup the value of
their assets over the course of two franchise periods (say, 14 years), they
could be showing a very good profit by the time the assets expire.
The lessors are far from convinced. Mr Roy Fullelove, chief manager at
Lloyds Leasing (part of Lloyds Bank), says the leasing industry is extremely
apprehensive about the risks involved.
'The franchising director might say the rolling stock has to be carried over
from one franchise period to the next, but who is to say the franchise will
still exist in seven years' time?' he asks. 'What if the government does a
Beeching on it and closes it down? You could be left with a lot of rolling
stock.'
Mr Freeman says the worries are overdone. Modern trains are much cheaper to
operate and maintain than older ones, so owners will always find a market
for them - all the more so if they order trains that can be used on a wide
variety of routes instead of the traditional custom-built rolling stock.
Even so, the uncertainties created by privatisation will inevitably create a
hiatus in orders for rolling stock: and if that means discomfort for
passengers, it could mean agony for the UK's beleaguered rolling stock
manufacturers.
The industry has the capacity to produce 2,200 vehicles annually, but even
during the record investment cycle of the past five years it has been
turning out only 500 a year.
So whatever the outcome of privatisation, the industry has capacity far in
excess of what is likely to be required. The closures and job losses that
have characterised the UK train-making industry in recent years may only
have been the beginning.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Hammer lives to fright again
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMMER FILMS, Britain's most famous horror film company, is about to rise
from the dead years after a stake was put through its heart when the
receiver was called in.
Mr Roy Skeggs, who bought the company from the receiver, has signed a
four-year deal with Warner Brothers to remake many of its old titles.
The agreement could involve productions worth more than Pounds 100m and give
a big boost to the hard-pressed British film industry.
The first film to be made under the agreement, a re-make of The Quatermass
Experiment, is expected to cost about Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.8m) and will
start filming in either London or Los Angeles in January. It will be the
first feature film to be produced by Hammer since Mr Skeggs bought the
company eight years ago, although the company has made television
programmes.
Mr Skeggs, who joined Hammer for four weeks 30 years ago and stayed on to be
production supervisor on Frankenstein films, said yesterday that he had
spent nearly five years reorganising the company and setting up the Warner
Brothers agreement.
'I now have a wonderful deal,' he said, adding that he plans to stay away
from re-makes of Dracula and Frankenstein.
Quatermass will be followed by updates of Stolen Face and The Devil Rides
Out and a new film Hideous Whispers to be directed by Richard Donner.
The Warner Brothers agreement is with Hammer and Donner/Schuler-Donner
Productions and involves developing film and television shows based on the
Hammer library and new material.
Mr Skeggs said a number of top directors including Martin Scorsese had
expressed interest in making pictures under the agreement.
Meanwhile details emerged yesterday of two satellite television channels
which will soon be broadcasting to the UK.
The Family Channel, which will be part of the British Sky Broadcasting
subscription package which starts in September, said yesterday it would be
producing more original family programming than any other cable or satellite
channel.
In its first British commission Action Time will produce 65 episodes of the
game show Trivial Pursuit for the channel. Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, holds a significant stake in BSkyB.
Landmark Communications, the US media group which owns The Weather Channel
and The Travel Channel in the US, has confirmed that it is to launch its
Travel Channel in Europe next year.
The Travel Channel in the UK will show programmes dealing with all aspects
of travel including 'action, adventure, culinary experiences and cultural
insights'.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Jaguar US sales jump 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the UK maker of luxury cars, increased its sales in the US, its most
important market, by 29.7 per cent in the first seven months of the year.
Sales in the US for the period rose to 6,828 from 5,266 in the same period
last year. July sales at 1,083 were more than double the 457 cars sold in
the same month last year, when demand was very depressed, the company said
yesterday.
Jaguar's improving fortunes in the US are the main factor behind its current
forecast that it will increase its sales worldwide for the whole of 1993 by
about 29 per cent to more than 29,000, compared with last year's 22,478.
In the first six months of this year sales worldwide rose by 8.8 per cent to
13,024 from 11,968 in the same period last year, but the company expects the
pace of recovery to accelerate in the second half of the year.
Sales are recovering from a low level following a steep decline in sales in
the previous four years from a peak of 49,494 in 1988.
Jaguar said yesterday that it had revised its US sales forecast upwards to
13,000 for 1993. Earlier it had forecast sales of 11,00 to 12,000. Sales
last year were 8,681, the lowest since 1981.
The improvement in the US is helping to compensate for falling sales in
continental Europe and Japan.
The recovery in its sales and output is allowing Jaguar, a subsidiary of
Ford of the US, to cut its losses, which were reduced to Dollars 115.1m in
the first half of the current year from Dollars 165.1m in the same period
last year.
The company said yesterday that under UK accounting rules it had a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 77.2m in the first half of the year, compared with a loss of
Pounds 88.3m in the corresponding period last year.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Responses ran 77% against approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 77 per cent of the responses to the first public consultation
were opposed to the granting of a licence to Thorp, the Pollution
Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday.
Nevertheless the inspectorate found 'no points of substance' that would
cause it to reconsider the terms of the draft licence to start operation.
The inspectorate's 180-page report, published yesterday, concludes that if
Thorp started operating the increase in emissions of the radioactive gas
Krypton 85 would not have a 'significant effect on weather or climate'. Some
environmentalists have argued that the gas could increase the electrical
conductivity of the atmosphere, and might increase the incidence of some
cancers.
The report also says the standards of the proposed licence 'effectively
protect human health, the food chain and the environment generally'.
The inspectorate had to assess more than 80,000 responses, 'significantly
larger than on previous occasions'.
Most of the responses supporting the plant argued that the proposed
authorisations tightened discharge limits. Many unions and local councils
backed the plant because of the jobs it would bring to an area of high
unemployment.
The inspectorate said that of the 'wider policy issues' raised, the most
common was 'that there is no justification for nuclear fuel reprocessing
generally and Thorp in particular'. It did not address this issue, nor
questions of proliferation of plutonium weapons and the risk of accidents in
transporting waste. The second consultation is intended to address these
points.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Cut in housing grants confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to proceed with cuts in grants paid to housing
associations.
Confirmation of the move follows warnings that lower grants would force up
rents, push more tenants on to social security benefits, and make it harder
for associations to borrow on the capital markets.
The cut, which will apply from April next year, will reduce the average
government grant to housing associations from 67 per cent of the price of a
new home for rent to 62 per cent. The balance is raised on the capital
markets, which lend about Pounds 1bn a year to associations.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, said that he would also be changing
the rules for allocating housing association grant. Associations that bid
for funds at less than the 62 per cent rate would have priority.
Priority would also be given to associations which supplemented government
grants with funds from local authorities and other public bodies, and to
those that raised their own funds by selling more homes to tenants.
The Department of the Environment yesterday said the government's target of
153,000 additional housing association homes in the three years to April
1995 should still be exceeded comfortably.
The government originally planned to reduce the grant rate to 60 per cent,
with a further cut to 55 per cent in 1995. That produced an outcry among
housing associations, builders and lenders, and was opposed by the Commons
environment committee.
It was also believed to have been against the advice of the Housing
Corporation, the quango that distributes the grant to associations.
The lower grant rate may make it harder for associations to borrow against
the security of their new homes. Many lenders want cover of 1 1/2 times the
amount of the loan. Because tenanted homes are valued at about half of their
cost, it can be hard to borrow much more than 35 per cent of the value of
the new home without additional security.
Housing associations warned that rents would have to rise. 'A headline rate
of 62 per cent is better than 60 per cent,' said Mr Len Bishop, chief
executive of Hyde housing association, one of Britain's largest, and a
member of the Right to Build campaign which has been fighting the cut. 'But
it still creates an affordability problem,' he added.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Brown urges check-off for Labour fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS SHOULD be asked to deduct Labour party membership fees from
employees' wages, in the same way as many union dues are collected, Mr
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
'Trade unions should be encouraged to negotiate a check-off arrangement for
party subs with individual companies,' Mr Brown said. 'Anyone seriously
interested in broadening our membership must start with the union movement.'
In a pamphlet published a week after the party agreed rule changes designed
to increase its membership, Mr Brown argued that cost should not be a
barrier to joining the Labour party. 'Spiralling membership fees as a means
of solving the party's financial problems is fool's gold,' he said.
The party is running an experiment in a small number of constituencies where
members may pay greatly reduced fees if the constituency continues to raise
guaranteed income for the national party. Mr Brown urged expansion of the
experiment to at least 100 constituencies.
The party agreed last week to cut its full membership fee from Pounds 18 to
Pounds 15, reversing a trend which had seen fees rise from Pounds 10 in just
two years. It also agreed to allow trade union political levy payers to join
the party for Pounds 3.
Mr Brown's proposals for extending check-off to party membership fees are
likely to prove controversial, coming after several large employers have
threatened to withdraw from similar arrangements for deducting union dues.
Unions in many industries have come to rely on check-off arrangements, under
which employers collect union dues for them, as a cheap and efficient method
of collection.
The government this year moved to tighten the law governing such schemes,
passing a bill requiring employers and unions to seek employees' agreement
to check-off at least every three years.
Increasing individual membership is seen by Labour modernisers as the key to
further diluting the power of the trade union block vote.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Manx timeshare plan curbs rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE OF MAN, the legal jurisdiction for many European Community
timeshare contracts, is considering a law which would provide a
substantially shorter 'cooling-off' period than that imposed by the UK and
sought by other EC governments.
The Consumers' Association fears the proposals could leave timeshare buyers
with a low level of protection.
Government officials on the island favour a seven-day cooling-off period,
during which buyers can get their money back. This compares with 14 days
specified by UK law or the period of between 14 and 28 days suggested for EC
legislation.
Timeshare buyers purchase a specified number of weeks each year at a holiday
resort. The industry has suffered damage to its reputation because of
high-pressure sales tactics.
More timeshare contracts in Europe are subject to Isle of Man law than any
other jurisdiction, says Mr Norman Burden, chairman of the Timeshare
Council, which represents the reputable side of the UK industry, and the
vice-president of the European Timeshare Federation. He defended the
seven-day period, saying most buyers who cancelled did so within 72 hours.
The Consumers' Association said yesterday: 'We wouldn't want to see Isle of
Man-registered companies ducking UK legislation. The cooling-off period is
absolutely essential.'
The Isle of Man completed consultation on the proposed law last weekend. The
legislation is expected to be introduced into the Manx parliament's next
session, beginning in October.
A consultative document prepared by an Isle of Man Treasury working group
and sent to industry representatives says: 'It has been suggested that if
legitimate timeshare business is to be encouraged to develop here, a shorter
cancellation period than exists in the UK would do much to impart a
marketing advantage to the Isle of Man.'
The document says the island's Board of Consumer Affairs would have liked to
offer the same level of consumer protection as exists in the UK.
The UK law, which came into effect last October, was regarded as providing
little protection to buyers because it did not apply where contracts were
concluded abroad. The Timeshare Council estimates that 75 per cent of UK
buyers enter into contracts abroad.
Proposed EC legislation suggested a 14-day cooling-off for contracts entered
into in the buyer's country of residence and 28 days for agreements signed
elsewhere in the EC. The European Parliament has recommended 21 days in both
cases.
The Isle of Man is exempt from much EC law and will not be subject to the
directive.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications has signed contracts with US and French suppliers
to test equipment that could lead to the next generation of
telecommunications network switches - the devices which route information
carried on telephone lines.
The contracts, with American Telephone and Telegraph of the US and Alcatel
of France, are for asynchronous transfer mode switches, which can handle far
greater capacity at greater speed.
Although the initial contracts are for only about Pounds 5m, trials of the
switches could lead to contracts worth hundreds of millions for the next
generation of equipment.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Mental patient rules to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will announce a tightening of arrangements for discharging
potentially dangerous patients from mental hospitals next week, Alan Pike
writes.
Pressure on the government to act has been intensified by public concern
over killings and other violent incidents involving discharged patients.
Ministers are expected to produce a package of changes, including the
appointment of social workers with specific responsibility for released
patients.
The measures will be designed to offer greater protection to both mentally
ill people and the public. About Pounds 2bn a year is spent on services for
the mentally ill. An increasing proportion of this has been devoted to
community-based services but mental health organisations say still more is
required to provide adequate services for the numbers of patients now being
released.
The government's community care reforms, designed to enable the elderly and
people with handicaps to live in the community, started in April. Ministers
are aware that the the reforms' credibility could be jeopardised by
continued acts of violence involving former mental patients.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Hurd moves swiftly to heal Tory split over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT ministers have launched a concerted attempt to heal Tory wounds
over Europe ahead of next year's European parliament elections.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has been holding private meetings
with Tory MPs representing all shades of opinion on Europe in an effort to
highlight policy areas where there is common ground.
Yesterday's meetings with Mr Bill Cash, the arch Euro-sceptic MP for
Stafford, and Mr Hugh Dykes, the strongly pro-European MP for Harrow East,
were portrayed by the government as fulfilling a pledge made during last
month's tumultuous Commons confidence debate.
Winding up the debate - called in response to the government's defeat over
Maastricht's social chapter - Mr Hurd promised to 'listen carefully to the
wide range of views within our party and outside'.
Mr Ian Taylor, the staunchly pro-European Tory MP for Esher who also met Mr
Hurd this week as a representative of the Positive European group, said
yesterday the foreign secretary had invited the group to develop its views
on 'the post-Maastricht agenda'.
Mr Taylor said he emphasised to Mr Hurd during a 40-minute meeting that
Maastricht was 'very much worth the effort' despite the exchange rate
mechanism's difficulties, but argued that there was now a need to explain to
people how the European Community could work to their advantage.
'We have spent a long time in necessary legal debate but what we now have to
do is show the EC is something individuals can benefit from,' Mr Taylor
said.
The meetings came as the continued bitterness of the party's divisions over
Europe was underlined by a savage attack by Sir Edward Heath, the former
prime minister, on Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor.
In The Times newspaper Sir Edward criticised Mr Lamont for his 'blundering
and panic' in the handling of events leading up to sterling's suspension
from the ERM last September.
Mr Hurd is understood to believe there is enough consensus to prevent the
party tearing itself apart either in the European election campaign or ahead
of the next EC intergovernmental conference scheduled for 1996. The Tory
European election manifesto is expected to reflect this.
Mr Hurd - who will chair the European election manifesto committee - is said
to believe that the recent turmoil in currency markets has consigned the
issue of monetary union to 'even longer grass than it was sitting in
before'.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Real cost of childcare rises steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTHERS spend four and a half times more on childcare in real terms than
they did 11 years ago, says a survey of 9,000 parents published in the
latest issue of Employment Gazette.
The increase in spending includes 'a large increase in the real cost of
childcare'.
State provision of childcare in Britain is negligible and most of it is
still provided by relatives and friends. However, nearly one-in-four working
mothers now pays for childcare and spends on average Pounds 30.70 a week on
it - a quarter of her earnings, the survey says.
In 1980 only 16 per cent of working mothers were paying for childcare.
Thirty-nine per cent of women with dependent children now work full-time and
the overall workforce participation rate of women in this category has
increased from 49 per cent to 63 per cent over the past two decades.
Nannies are the most costly form of childcare at an average of Pounds 72 a
week.
Only about a third of nannies receive more than Pounds 100 a week, according
to the survey. However, it does not diff-erentiate between live-in nannies
and those who live out.
Parents who use a 'nursery or creche' pay Pounds 39 a week, on average, and
'nursery schools and playgroups' cost an average Pounds 34 a week.
The proportion of earnings spent on childcare is highest for the
least-well-paid and for part-time workers. Payments for childcare rise as
hours of work and earnings increase, but only a minority - the best-paid
women - spend more than Pounds 40 a week on childcare.
Thirty-eight per cent of those paying for childcare spend less than Pounds
20 a week and 61 per cent less than Pounds 40.
Lone parents have a greater reliance on childcare. Among lone parents with
jobs, 29 per cent pay for childcare - at an average cost of Pounds 24.60 a
week.
Of those who pay anything for childcare, only 19 per cent of lone parents
and a third of couples spend more than Pounds 40 a week and only about one
in 10 of all working mothers spend more than Pounds 60 a week.
The average household's expenditure rose by nearly Pounds 15 a week last
year, according to the government's Family Expenditure Survey. Average
weekly expenditure in 1992 was Pounds 271.80 compared with Pounds 256.90 in
1991. The average gross household income was Pounds 342.90 per week compared
with Pounds 338.20 a year earlier.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Advisers 'exploit' the newly redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PEOPLE made redundant are being exploited by financial advisers who ignore
their clients' needs, the Consumers' Association says.
A report in this month's Which? magazine found that nearly two thirds of
financial advisers gave newly redundant people bad advice. The advice was
also strongly biased towards commission-paying investment options.
The association sent researchers posing as redundant employees with a Pounds
25,000 lump sum to a total of 30 banks, building societies, insurance
companies and independent financial advisers.
The researchers made it clear they did not have another job in prospect and
had no other source of income. The best advice, according to Which?, would
have been to put the money in a savings account until their situation was
clearer.
Instead, almost two thirds of the advisers recommended putting some, or all,
of the lump sum into an investment bond which would pay substantial
commission to the adviser but which would involve some risk to the investor.
This included high charges and possible losses if it were cashed in early.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association, said:
'Commission talks, and consumers are the casualties. Clearly the current
regulatory mechanisms aren't doing the job they were set up to do.'
Nearly a third of the advisers failed to disclose whether they were
independent or tied to one insurance company.
Mr John Pinniger of Fimbra, the self-regulating body for financial advisers,
said: 'We recognise that quality is not consistent across the industry -
that is something that has to be dealt with and we are doing that.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / Union officials see benefits in secret ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL requirement for a secret ballot before a trade union can call a
strike has been the most important reason for the reduction in industrial
disruption in Britain over recent years, says a survey of officials from the
former AEU engineering union.
The report, from the London School of Economics, also covered most of
Britain's large and medium-sized unions.
It is the first comprehensive study of the effect of recent labour
legislation on union behaviour.
Its main findings are likely to vindicate the government's assertions that
Conservative labour law reform during the 1980s has had a substantial effect
on the way unions act.
The survey was conducted before the AEU's recent merger with the EETPU
electricians union to form the AEEU.
The research among AEU officials found that as many as 61 per cent of those
covered by the study said the law had been 'the most important factor
affecting industrial action'.
Some 56 per cent said they also believed the law 'had been an important
weapon favouring employers in their negotiations' with unions.
A total of 77 per cent of the union's full-time officers said the
introduction of statutory pre-strike ballots had been a 'good thing' for the
unions, with 87 per cent of those held in the AEU producing votes in favour
of industrial action.
Just under a third of officials added that as a result they were 'now more
accountable to their members,' while 83 per cent thought AEU members were
much more reluctant to take industrial action than they had been in the
past.
The report, by Mr Bob Simpson and Ms Jill Elgar, suggests that union members
see pre-strike ballots as a way of strengthening officials' negotiating hand
rather than a signal for the outbreak of industrial conflict.
Apparently 'a convincing yes vote in a ballot could often lead to an
improved offer or withdrawal of proposals in dispute without industrial
action going ahead', the survey argues.
The report says 'the majority thought that members were now less likely to
take spontaneous industrial action than in the 1970s'. The full report will
be published later this month.
As many as 91 per cent of respondents thought employers 'had become more
hardline in their dealings with unions'.
The AEU response rate was 56 per cent and was made up mainly of district
secretaries and divisional organisers.

FT  05 AUG 93 / Level of business failures falls for fourth month
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of businesses going into receivership has fallen for the fourth
month in a row, according to figures released yesterday by Touche Ross, the
accountancy firm.
July saw 239 administration orders and receivership appointments - half the
number that there were in July last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, insolvency partner at Touche Ross, said there was
every indication that receivership would remain at the same level or decline
even further in the coming months. 'The reduction is indicative of the haul
out of recession and also suggests that companies are not yet suffering from
cash flow pressures which are a common feature of recovery,' he said.
A regional breakdown of the figures shows a particular drop in appointments
in London and south-east England - with 89 appointments in July, compared
with an average of 180 a month last year. Recovery still seems slower in
north-west England, and the Yorkshire and Humberside regions. For the second
month running there were hardly any appointments in Scotland - three in
July, against four in June.
The property and construction sectors saw 37 appointments in July, against
an average of 81 a month in 1992. Most other sectors showed a 'steady
downward trend', although the hotel and catering trades were recovering more
slowly with 21 appointments against the 1992 average of 27.
Mr Morris said: 'The trends these figures indicate fully support the view
that the British economy is recovering. Whether coincidence or not, I
speculate that there may be some correlation between the drop in the number
of appointments and key factors affecting business confidence. The first
major drop in the rate of appointments in April 1992 coincided with the
Conservatives winning the general election and the second drop in April 1993
followed on from the reversal of unemployment trends.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / Printers set face against family firm: Roland Adburgham on a
bitter pay dispute set to cause repercussions in the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX official pickets outside the gates of JW Arrowsmith in Bristol,
clutching golf umbrellas to ward off the summer rain, are sacked employees
with 70 years of service at the printing company between them. For the past
three months their only service has been on the picket line.
They and 116 colleagues were dismissed on April 26 when, after a ballot,
they took industrial action as part of a national campaign for a pay rise of
Pounds 6.50 a week. They were offered re-engagement with personal contracts,
a pay freeze and derecognition of their union, the GPMU print union. Only a
handful have returned to work.
Labour MPs have protested at the dismissals as an attack on workers' rights.
The company's business is badly hit but the management is unmoved. It says
it could not afford the pay claim, unofficial action had affected overtime
working since January, and it would not recognise a union that supported
disruption. It has obtained a High Court injunction to limit the number of
pickets to six.
The Arrowsmith dispute has become a test of will. On one side is a union
which claims 280,000 members, 80,000 of them in general printing, where it
is seeking to maintain its strength. It is led by Mr Tony Dubbins, formerly
general secretary of the National Graphical Union which merged with Sogat to
form the GPMU. On the other side is a family business established in the
19th century and headed by Miss Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown, a descendant of
the founder.
The dispute is being watched throughout the industry, where for the first
time since 1980 there has been no national pay agreement with the British
Printing Industry Federation, representing 2,400 companies and groups.
The federation offered Pounds 2.92 compared with a revised GPMU claim of
Pounds 6.50 a week plus an extra day's holiday, equivalent to 3.8 per cent.
'The key word is affordability,' said Mr Andrew Brown of the federation.
'There is only a very slow and painful process for the industry out of
recession.'
Since negotiations broke down, the union has sought individual deals on the
same basis. Some 88 companies have been affected by industrial action,
according to the federation, which says 1,060 of its members have reached a
settlement, nearly two-thirds for less than the claim.
Mr Tony Burke, deputy general-secretary of the GPMU, argues that the
federation's figures are 'all over the place' and the campaign has been 'an
outstanding success' with 1,600 companies meeting the claim. He said: 'What
has been remarkable has been the way our members have been prepared to stand
up and be prepared to ballot to get a decent pay increase.'
He does not accept that some companies cannot afford it. 'During the
recession commercial printing has not been affected in the same way that the
rest of manufacturing industry has been.'
Two other companies where there have been dismissals after industrial action
are also being picketed: Revell &amp; George of Salford, Manchester, and Harvest
Printers of Macclesfield, Derbyshire. Neither company is as big as JW
Arrowsmith, which employed 162 people before the dispute, and is the only
one where derecognition is an issue.
It seems an unlikely company to be enmeshed in an intractable dispute. It
published Diary of a Nobody and Three Men in a Boat, and its reputation
today rests on technical typesetting for scientific journals such as Nature.
Its skilled workforce was not noted for its militancy. Until recent times,
Miss Arrowsmith-Brown was addressed as Miss Victoria.
Industrial relations deteriorated after the withdrawal of a bonus scheme in
1988. Mr Geoff Collard, branch secretary of the GPMU, says: 'After 1988 it
was never the same. Miss Arrowsmith-Brown's reputation as a boss suffered
badly. The national wage campaign of 1993 was a trigger that would have been
pulled anyway.'
On the picket line, the sacked workers agree. 'The dispute is purely about
events within the firm,' said Mr Brian Willcox, who had been with Arrowsmith
for 33 years. The workers believe the dispute was exploited by the company
to reduce its workforce - partly because of technological changes - without
incurring heavy redundancy costs.
Miss Arrowsmith-Brown, in her spartan office, says the company has been
reduced in size but that is a consequence of the dispute and not a planned
management conspiracy. 'Really the issue is about pay, and our inability to
meet a pay claim, and that for us is the beginning and end of it,' she says.
'But there is a tendency to want to make it an issue of derecognition.'
She says the company was badly hit last year and made a trading loss of
Pounds 210,000 on a turnover of Pounds 4.6m. The total pay bill in 1992 was
11 per cent higher than the previous year, and the company calculated that
it could achieve break-even this year - but only with a pay freeze.
Since the dismissals, she has had one meeting with Mr Dubbins, but there
were no negotiations. Miss Arrowsmith-Brown says: 'I think naturally people
are watching to see what happens, but most firms wouldn't have been prepared
to do what we did, which was to sacrifice business accounts.
'We are probably doing about half the business we were before the dispute.
But we think we can survive - there is no reason why we cannot operate at a
reduced rate successfully.'
A defeat for the GPMU at Arrowsmith might encourage erosion of its power in
general printing, where it has avoided the fate of its predecessors in the
national newspaper industry. A consequence already of the failure to reach a
national settlement is that the federation will consult its members this
autumn on whether they want to negotiate a settlement next year.
Mr Burke says there has been 'a great deal of partnership' in the past and
the national agreement had given the industry stability.
Mr Clive Fricker, the federation's south-west regional director, says:
'There is no orchestrated plan to oust the union from general printing.
We've had very positive relations with the GPMU which have stood the test of
many problems.
'But there is a question over the worth of the national agreement which has
to be debated. The jury is out.'

FT  05 AUG 93 / Pensions loophole under fire as bias claims mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES of the Coloroll pension schemes are to ask the European Court of
Justice to close a loophole which could allow male pensioners to claim the
lion's share of benefits from the schemes.
The move comes as hundreds of thousands of public-sector and private-sector
male pensioners - including Coloroll scheme members - are rushing to file
claims for more generous pension benefits. They hope to beat a deadline
implied by a preliminary ruling on a case before the court.
Mr Mark Grant, of solicitors McKenna and Co, which represented the Coloroll
pension scheme in a landmark case on sex equality before the court, said
failure to close the loophole 'could lead to a situation where women in some
Coloroll schemes will get practically nothing'.
Because Coloroll, the former UK furnishings group, is in liquidation, the
only way to pay improved benefits to men is to take them out of women's
entitlement.
Coloroll pension scheme members had asked the court to clarify how an
earlier judgment on sex equality in pensions would work in practice for such
elements as money-purchase schemes or schemes which offered lump-sum
payments to pensioners.
The Coloroll schemes, like other European pension schemes, offered slightly
higher lump sums to women because of longer life expectation and the
consequent need for more money to buy an appropriate annuity.
On April 28, the advocate-general urged the court to rule that these
commutation payments must be the same for men and women but said no employer
would have to improve men's benefits for any period before the date of the
final decision, which is expected next month. He suggested that men who had
complaints in train at the date of the decision could also qualify for extra
benefits.
The Central Office of the Industrial Tribunals said yesterday that more than
140,000 police officers and retired officers had filed applications since
the advocate-general's ruling alleging sex discrimination in pension
benefits. The number of applications represents about two years' worth of
work for the tribunals.
The Police Federation has advised every serving male police officer to file
an application before judgment on the Coloroll group of cases is delivered.
It has also advised all male former police officers who have retired since
1976 to file claims. The total number of claims could exceed 200,000.
Other groups look set to follow suit. Some men among the 40,000 members of
the British Airways Pension Scheme plan to file applications and the Trades
Union Congress said it was advising 'all unions to examine schemes very
closely for areas of discrimination'. Some fire service workers and
employees at the Civil Aviation Authority have also lodged claims.
Mr John Allison, a national officer of the IPMS Civil Service union, which
represents some CAA workers, said he was liaising with other Civil Service
unions about possible sex discrimination claims. Unison, the 1.4m-strong
public-sector union, is also seeking legal advice about the terms of
pensions in local government and the utilities.
In the finance sector, the first claims are likely to be made against
Barclays Bank. Both the Barclays' staff union and Bifu, the banking union,
are advising members to consider tribunal claims. But Bifu is warning
members that 'any gains from lodging tribunal claims are likely to be
extremely limited'.
The Equal Opportunities Commission said it had advised 'hundreds' of men who
had contacted the commission to file claims.
