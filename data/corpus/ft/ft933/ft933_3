FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Parmalat lifted by acquisitions

<TEXT>
PARMALAT, the Italian dairy products group, saw first-half pre-tax profits
after minority interests climb to L55bn (Dollars 34.8m) from L43bn last year
due to internal growth and acquisitions.
Group turnover rose 54.3 per cent to L1,240bn from L803bn, helped partly by
takeovers, which contributed sales of L196bn in the period.
The group, which made net profits of L52bn last year, said it expected the
trend in sales and earnings to be maintained over the rest of the year.
The consolidation of Giglio, a dairy group in which Parmalat earlier this
year bought the remaining 70 per cent of the shares not owned, would have
added L175bn in turnover in the first half and raised operating profits by
about L4bn to L131bn.
Parmalat's growth came partly at the cost of a rise in net indebtedness to
L599bn at the end of June, from L495bn last December. Net financial charges
rose to L40bn in the first half from L33bn in the same period last year.
Acquisitions in the first half cost the group L122bn.
Sales in Italy, where takeover opportunities are limited, rose by 9.5 per
cent to L726bn through a mixture of organic growth and small purchases of
local dairy companies. European turnover outside Italy improved to L106bn
from L13bn. South America sales jumped 177 per cent to L344bn from L124bn.
Merloni, the Italian white goods group, reported pre-tax profits of L14.3bn
in the first six months of this year, compared with L7bn last year.

FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Procordia steady in first six
months

<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, said
yesterday that profits before financial items for the first six months were
virtually unchanged at SKr2.24bn (Dollars 283m).
The group benefited from the weaker krona and a two-month contribution from
Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the newly-acquired Italian pharmaceutical company.
But its performance was hit by worse results from its consumer product
companies, losses sustained by a hotel unit, and lower financial income.
The group was presenting its last financial figures before formally
splitting its drug and non-drug activities next month. Under an agreement
between the company's two main owners, Volvo and the Swedish government,
Volvo is to move towards full control of the group's consumer products
activities, leaving the state with a 60 per cent holding in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses, which it could privatise next
spring.
The weaker krona pushed sales up 9 per cent to SKr21.5bn, with income from
ongoing operations up 17 per cent at SKr2.50bn.
Kabi Pharmacia lifted sales by 42 per cent to SKr9.5bn. However, excluding
Farmitalia, sales were up only 20 per cent, with volume growth a
disappointing 2 per cent.
Volumes fell 10 per cent in Germany - where pharmaceutical companies have
been under pressure - and 8 per cent in Spain. The growth hormone segment
was the worst affected, due to adverse developments in the Australia, Spain,
Italy and the UK.
Revenues for what will remain of Procordia after the split rose 39 per cent
to SKr10.7bn, while income from ongoing operations climbed 45 per cent to
SKr1.83bn. Consumer product sales dropped 10 per cent to SKr10.8bn and
income from ongoing operations fell 23 per cent to SKr665m.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts behind recovery at HTV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HTV GROUP, the ITV company for Wales and the West Country, returned to the
black in the first half with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m.
This compared with a previous loss of Pounds 5m. Earnings per share were
1.5p (5.4p losses).
Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, said the figures were the result of 'strict,
continuing cost control procedures'. The group was not declaring an interim
dividend as the board 'considered it wise to continue to conserve cash and
to allow the benefit of the full year cost savings to reach the bottom
line'.
The group, which underwent a management shake-up in June, reduced operating
costs by Pounds 15m in the half. It has cut more than 70 jobs, leaving a
staff of 390. Mr Sherwood said that in spite of the cuts, HTV's local
programme production was 37 per cent ahead on the 1992 half.
Profits from television operations rose from Pounds 8m to Pounds 11.2m
before a payment to the Treasury of Pounds 10.2m, equivalent to half its
Pounds 20.5m bid to retain its franchise. Previously the group paid a
Channel 4 subscription of Pounds 9.6m.
Total turnover fell from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 61m. Advertising revenue
fell from Pounds 45.3m to Pounds 40.7m, reflecting the fact the group no
longer sells airtime for Channel 4, but is in direct competition with it.
HTV said the loss of revenue had been more than balanced by the removal of
the Channel 4 subscription at the start of the year. It put the net benefit
of the changes at Channel 4 at Pounds 5m for the half-year.
The group's share of ITV's net advertising revenue grew from 5.8 per cent
previously to 6 per cent in the half.
Mr Sherwood said the creation of a joint sales force with Meridian
Broadcasting would generate economies of scale and strengthen sales
potential in the southern television regions. It also handles airtime sales
for Westcountry Television, S4C and Channel Television.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths cuts losses by 42%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tight cost controls, reduced interest charges and an improvement in sales
and margins helped Goldsmiths Group, the retail jeweller, cut losses from
Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 1.1m for the six months to August 28.
Turnover was up from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 19.7m.
'We are seeing a distinct improvement at the top end of the market,' said Mr
Jurek Piasecki, chairman. 'This is particularly so in the south-east which
is currently 16 per cent up on the corresponding period last year.'
Directors have decided to pass the interim dividend and will review the
final once the outcome for the year, which is strongly dependent on the
Christmas market, is known.
Losses per share were reduced to 3.35p (5.74p).

Greenacre Group, the nursing home operator, benefited from continuing
expansion to produce a 31 per cent rise in interim profits, from Pounds
605,000 to Pounds 794,000 pre-tax.
The outcome was achieved despite a turnround from net interest receivable of
Pounds 152,000 to payable of Pounds 45,000.
Over the six months to July 31 the USM-traded group lifted the number of
beds under operation and/or development from 384 to 575, located in 12 homes
across the UK.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 2.08m) including a Pounds 194,000
contribution from acquisitions. Profits at the operating level leapt 85 per
cent to Pounds 839,000 (Pounds 453,000) with acquisitions accounting for
Pounds 60,000.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.15p (0.13p), payable from fully diluted
earnings of 0.32p (0.25p) per share.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: S Lyles loss blamed on recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION at home and abroad left S Lyles, the West Yorkshire-based spinner
and dyer, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 89,000 for the year to June 30,
against profits of Pounds 1.4m.
With falls in home and export markets turnover was Pounds 14.5m, against
Pounds 16.7m.
The fall overseas meant the company could not take advantage of the
devaluation of sterling, while being hit by higher costs of imported
materials.
Mr John Lyles, chairman, said further steps had been taken to cut costs.
Thirty jobs were shed during the year.
After a tax credit of Pounds 190,000 (Pounds 364,000 charge) earnings per
share were 1.39p (10.66p).
The company will pay a second interim dividend of 1.75p, against last year's
3.35p final, and bringing payment forward from January to November. The
total is 3.3p (4.9p).

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Linread advances 63% to Pounds 714,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINREAD, the fasteners manufacturer, reported a 63 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits despite faltering demand for its motor and aerospace
components.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 714,000 in the six months to July 3, compared
with Pounds 439,000 a year earlier restated from Pounds 1.05m for FRS 3 and
FRED 4.
Although turnover was only slightly down at Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 20m), Mr
Peter Harrisson, chief executive, warned that deepening recession in
continental Europe would hamper second half performance.
'The market is damned ugly. We don't see a massive upturn before 1995 -
trading profits plateaued during the first half of this year and look
unlikely to improve.
Mr Harrisson said changes within the group, combined with tight management
of working capital and reduced stocks, would strengthen the balance sheet
and enable expansion when the market improves.
A significant cut in gearing, from 50 per cent at the end of last year to 26
per cent, and in associated interest payments, allowed the company to lift
the interim dividend to 1.57p (1.5p).
Earnings per share showed a sharp improvement to 3.74p (0.62p).
However, Mr Harrisson said: 'I'm not even cautiously optimistic about the
future. Europe is depressed and recovery in the US is only slow. We don't
see any evidence of green shoots.'
His verdict reflects an interim loss by the company's commercial products
division; no sign of improvement in the aero-engine market; and a 20 per
cent fall in car sales in continental Europe.

GREENACRE GROUP, the nursing home operator, benefited from continuing
expansion to produce a 31 per cent rise in interim profits, from Pounds
605,000 to Pounds 794,000 pre-tax.
The outcome was achieved despite a turnround from net interest receivable of
Pounds 152,000 to payable of Pounds 45,000.
Over the six months to July 31 the USM-traded group lifted the number of
beds under operation and/or development from 384 to 575, located in 12 homes
across the UK.
Mr Tony Acton, chairman, said the group had 'been little affected by the
occupancy problems experienced by some operators' following the introduction
of Community Care reforms in April.
Turnover rose to Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 2.08m) including a Pounds 194,000
contribution from acquisitions. Profits at the operating level leapt 85 per
cent to Pounds 839,000 (Pounds 453,000) with acquisitions accounting for
Pounds 60,000.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.15p (0.13p), payable from fully diluted
earnings of 0.32p (0.25p) per share.
A strong performance from both existing and new homes was expected in the
second half, Mr Acton said. Panmure Gordon, the group's broker, expects
profits of about Pounds 1.7m and earnings of 0.7p per share for the year to
January 1994.
Shareholders' funds at the period end amounted to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds
11.8m) giving gearing of some 11 per cent (nil).

Cinpres, based in Staffordshire, makes and licences specialist patented gas
injection control systems to more than 100 licensees worldwide.
For the year to March 31 its pre-tax profits were Pounds 806,000 on sales of
Pounds 2.02m, some 90 per cent of which were overseas.
Net assets, excluding intangible patent assets, were Pounds 1,000, and at
acquisition Cinpres had cash in hand of Pounds 223,000 and no borrowings.
The vendor has undertaken not to sell the shares in the market for at least
one year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HELPED BY a strong contribution from acquisitions, the Ticketing Group
staged a recovery in the first half to June 30, reporting a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 273,000 for the six months.
The turnround, from a deficit of Pounds 11.2m last time, was achieved on
turnover up from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 20.9m and included the results of
Ticketing (UK) for the first time.
The USM-quoted group, which operated as a joint venture between Expedier and
Wembley until early this year, is involved in retail ticket sales, event
management services, and the provision of computerised ticketing systems.
The directors said the process of consolidating the company's position
following the rights issue in January continued throughout the period.
Earnings per share came out at 0.04p (12.28p losses). As explained at the
time of the rights issue, there is no dividend.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Vodafone lifts paging side with Air Call
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the mobile communications company, has become the UK's second
largest paging operator with its purchase of Air Call Holdings from
BellSouth Enterprises, the US telecoms company.
The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, almost doubles the subscriber base of
Vodapage, Vodafone's paging subsidiary.
With about 200,000 paging subscribers, Vodafone now has more than a quarter
of the UK paging market, ahead of Mercury with about 15 per cent. BT
dominates the market with a 55 per cent share.
Air Call - with 350 employees and headquarters in Welwyn Garden City - will
be run by Vodafone as a separate concern in the short term, but will be
fully integrated with Vodapage in due course.
The takeover is a further stage in the rationalisation of the UK's
lacklustre paging sector.
The number of operators has reduced from six to four in the last two years,
the fourth being Hutchison Paging.
The four are all significant forces in the cellular mobile industry.
Vodafone is the market leader; BT has a majority stake in Cellnet; Cable and
Wireless, Mercury's parent, has a half share in One-2-One; and Hutchison has
a telepoint service and will launch a PCN cellular network next year.
The UK has about 750,000 paging subscribers, against 1.6m cellular mobile
subscribers.
CIT Research, the telecoms consultancy, expects the UK paging market to grow
at about 2 per cent a year over the next decade, far slower than the
cellular market.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Waterford Foods pays Pounds 7.4m for Dairy
Crest's Durham dairy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY CREST, the milk and dairy products group, has sold another dairy in
its programme to reconfigure the business ahead of next year's flotation.
The buyer is Waterford Foods, the Irish dairy group whose strategy is to
expand its UK market share.
Waterford is buying Dairy Crest's Durham dairy, with 22 distribution depots
and its ex-farm haulage fleet, for Pounds 7.4m free of debt. The business
has annual operating profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 18m, and net
assets of Pounds 4.5m.
Dairy Crest has sold four other dairies this year and closed another.
The milk industry is in a state of flux ahead of next year's abolition of
the milk marketing board, which currently owns Dairy Crest.
The Durham dairy handles 9m gallons of milk a year, most of which is sold
through 220 doorstep milk rounds in Durham and Northumberland.
The deal will give Waterford about 5 per cent of the liquid milk market in
England and Wales. Waterford, which has approaching 30 per cent of the
market in the Manchester area, said this was its first step into the
north-east region. The dairy has about a 12 per cent stake of that regional
market.
Waterford's strategy is to build up significant regional market shares. It
introduces its 'Waterford Standard' to milk rounds to combat the decline in
the share of the liquid milk market that doorstep delivery takes. This
includes delivery by 8am, and enabling customers to change orders on a free
telephone number until the midnight before delivery.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sykes shares drop on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Andrews Sykes fell by 30p to 75p yesterday after the specialist
industrial services group confirmed that first-half results would be
'significantly below those of last year', and said it would omit the interim
dividend and defer payment of the preference dividend.
In addition the group, which last year fought off an attempt by Mr Jacques
Murray, the dissident shareholder who holds a 29.2 per cent stake in the
group, to unseat Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and take control of the board,
announced that Mr Peter Webber, chief executive, had stepped down.
Mr David Martin, until recently chief executive of James Neill Holdings,
will succeed Mr Webber who has resigned with effect from November 1.
In a statement explaining the move the group said that considerable progress
had been made over the last two years in integrating the two businesses
brought together to form Andrews Sykes.
In a separate trading statement the group warned that 'an early appraisal of
the second quarter's results' had confirmed that turnover in the main
Andrews Sykes operations had been disappointingly low and therefore the
results would be significantly below last time.
As a result the board had decided to conserve cash and distributable
reserves by omitting the interim dividend and deferring payment of the
preference dividend due in December.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional puts Ibstock into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, the UK's third largest brick maker, reported a Pounds 17.1m
pre-tax loss in the first-half after taking a Pounds 20.2m exceptional
charge, mainly to cover the costs of closing one of its two Portuguese pulp
mills.
The deficit in the six months to June 30 1993 compared with a Pounds 3.1m
profit a year earlier and came on turnover which edged ahead to Pounds
141.8m (Pounds 138.1m).
At the trading level the group reported a Pounds 1.87m loss compared with a
Pounds 2.24m profit last time.
The combined UK, US and continental European building products operations
produced a profit down from Pounds 2.65m to Pounds 1.21m.
However, as a result of falling prices in fiercely competitive markets, the
forest products division incurred an increased Pounds 3.08m loss, up from
Pounds 409,000.
The exceptional charge was partly offset by a Pounds 6.29m profit on the
sale of assets.
Net interest costs were Pounds 1.39m compared with net interest receipts of
Pounds 857,000 in the year-ago period.
Losses per share of 4.93p compared with earnings of 0.76p.
The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 0.5p and the share price
closed just 1p lower yesterday at 76p.
Following a review of its forest product operations the group decided to
close the smaller and less effici-ent of its two pulp mills in Portugal,
which resulted in an asset write off and closure costs totalling Pounds
18.7m.
In the core building products division Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing
director, said there was now 'some encouragement' from the UK businesses,
which reported reduced profits of Pounds 1.14m (Pounds 2.71m) on flat
turnover of about Pounds 30m.
Mr Maclellan said Ibstock's brick sales in the first six months were between
14 per cent and 15 per cent higher compared with a 4 per cent increase in
overall demand.
'We are now seeing some improvement in prices for the first time since the
start of the recession,' he said.
COMMENT
Ibstock's management deserves credit for making all the right moves -
painful though they have been - and the group should be well positioned to
take advantage of the upturn. Brick stocks have been reduced, costs cut and
market share boosted by expanding into the housing market. Total UK brick
sales this year should reach 3bn compared with 2.9bn last year and 4.8bn at
the 1988 peak. Excluding exceptionals the group should break even this year
and make between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m at the pre-tax level and up to
2.6p of earnings in 1994.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CLM sees strong return within four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VEHICLE for injecting corporate capital into the Lloyd's insurance market
has estimated that it could be generating underwriting returns of 10 per
cent a year within four years.
CLM Insurance Fund is projecting an underwriting return and dividend of 10
per cent in the fourth year of operation of its proposed Lloyd's investment
trust.
The details emerged in the pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday - the
first such document to be issued by the 12 or so institutions sponsoring
funds to exploit the possible introduction of corporate capital to Lloyd's.
The figures assume investment portfolio growth of 7.5 per cent gross a year,
investment return of 4 per cent gross and that 100 per cent of pledged
capacity is taken up by syndicates.
The fund is backed by CLM Advisers, a division of Sedgwick and Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, which is also sponsoring the placing and offer for subscription.
Money will come through an investment trust, with the shares offered at 100p
each. The final number of shares on offer will not be determined for several
weeks until syndicates at Lloyd's have estimated their capacity for
corporate capital.
The principle of introducing corporate capital must be ratified by Lloyd's
Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - at an EGM on
October 20.
Provisional details of another Lloyd's corporate capital fund were
circulated yesterday. The HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust will place up to
Pounds 100m on the insurance market.
If approved, it plans to underwrite conservatively, with an initial overall
premium limit of 150 per cent of money raised net of expenses.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Automation helps margins as Metalrax edges
up to Pounds 3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALRAX, the engineering components, housewares and storage equipment
group, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 3.41m in the six
months to June 30.
Mr Eric Moore, managing director, said this was a pleasing result 'in the
current economic climate and in the engineering sector', and, he added,
'despite 'costdown' (price reduction) in automotive and housewares'.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 30m). Mr Moore said that
margins had been 'retained mostly through automation' - in the past four
years capital expenditure had exceeded Pounds 20m and that level of outlay
was not likely to decrease, he said.
Net cash balances rose from Pounds 6m at the end of 1992 to Pounds 6.5m at
June 30.
Mr Moore said that the pre-tax profits figure would have been Pounds 50,000
better had it not been for the decline in interest rates.
Mr John Wardle, chairman, said there had been 'an increase in the number of
suitable businesses appearing' and that acquisition announcements were a
'possibility before Christmas'.
Mr Moore said that heads of agreement had been signed with two such
possibilities - one in housewares and the other in precision components, but
both bringing complementary ranges to the group's products.
They would be cash and equity deals, he said, and would not use up all the
cash pile. He added that discussions were continuing with two other
companies, but at a less advanced stage.
In terms of turnover and profits, precision components accounted for 50 per
cent, housewares 30 per cent, and storage and materials handling equipment
20 per cent.
Earnings per share edged up to 2.8p (2.7p) and the interim dividend is
lifted 10 per cent to 1p (0.91p adjusted for May's scrip issue).

Some Pounds 325,000 of the consideration is receivable immediately, with
Pounds 2.6m on completion and the balance due on March 1 1994. The proceeds

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker Pounds 83.3m in the red after
interest - Evening opening boosts turnover at William Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the leisure and property group which continues to trade with
the support of its bankers as it breaches covenants agreed during last
year's refinancing, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83.3m in the half year to
end-June after an interest charge of Pounds 98.1m.
Although the interest charge had fallen from Pounds 107.9m, helped by lower
interest rates, the pre-tax loss was up from Pounds 79.4m. There was a
transfer from reserves of Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 80.7m).
William Hill, the group's betting shop chain, whose future is under
consideration by Brent Walker, increased its turnover by 11.5 per cent to
Pounds 791.4m.
Mr John Leach, finance director, said he estimated that a change to evening
opening had increased turnover between 5 and 10 per cent.
The non-running of the Grand National had cost William Hill about Pounds 2m,
Mr Leach thought, and operating profits were down 5.2 per cent to Pounds
24.2m (Pounds 25.5m).
Mr Leach said if Brent Walker were to float William Hill it would probably
wait until the new year when an estimate of 1993 profits could be made.
The other options are to sell the chain or refinance its ring-fenced loan,
which falls due on March 1 next year.
Brent Walker's pub business suffered difficult trading conditions, and
profits fell from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 5.14m. The figures were affected by
costs of restructuring the business, Mr Leach said.
Group turnover was up 10 per cent to Pounds 858.9m, with that from
continuing operations up 11.5 per cent. Operating profits totalled Pounds
25.3m (Pounds 28.5m) after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1m).
These relate to refinancing costs and provisions against asset values. There
was an Pounds 11.7m charge relating to losses on sales or planned sales.
Mr Leach said that William Hill's operating profit roughly equalled its
interest bill, and the group is also paying interest on a Pounds 70m new
money facility extended by its banks at the time of last year's refinancing.
In all about Pounds 27m of the interest was paid in cash, with the remainder
rolled up into the debt or converted into preference shares.
The balance sheet shows negative net worth of Pounds 629.8m, up from Pounds
557.9m at the end of 1992. Net bank debt grew from Pounds 1.33bn at the year
end to Pounds 1.37m as interest accrued, and convertible notes remained at
the year end figure of Pounds 87.9m.
Brent Walker is still waiting for an adjudication on its dispute with Grand
Metropolitan over the Pounds 685m price it paid for William Hill and Mecca
Bookmakers. Both sides have made further submissions to the arbitrator.
Brent Walker continues to owe GrandMet the final Pounds 50m of the purchase
price, plus about Pounds 20m of accrued interest.

<TEXT>
HAMMERSON, the inter-national property investment company that is in the
hands of new management, yesterday reported a decline in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 15.2m for the six months to June 30.
The fall in profits coincided with a period of continued weakness in many of
Hammerson's international markets.
However it primarily stemmed from a decline in rental income from Pounds
61.4m to Pounds 59.8m, following property sales, and from a reduction of
Pounds 6m in the amount of interest capitalised by the group.
'Conditions have remained difficult in many of Hammerson's territories in
1993,' said Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman. A further fall in asset
values is expected at the year-end.
Hammerson, which announced plans for the equalisation of votes between the
ordinary shares and the 'A' ordinary shares when it launched its Pounds 200m
rights issue in May, said that it would outline details of its proposals
later this year.
Mr Ron Spinney, who joined the group as chief executive in May, said he had
overhauled the management structure to shorten lines of communication.
Management had suffered from an unwieldy board structure, unclear
objectives, inefficiencies, poor management of human resources and a lack of
research. Steps to tackle these problems included restructuring the board,
devolving operational authority and cutting overheads.
A review of strategy indicated that more emphasis should be placed on the UK
content of the portfolio. This would be achieved primarily by further
investment in the UK, rather than by sales of overseas assets, Hammerson
said. Some overseas properties might be sold when markets recovered.
The group also plans to go beyond its traditional concentration on offices
and shopping complexes to increase the retail part of its portfolio.
Overheads fell from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 7.8m. In the UK, staff numbers
have been cut by 15 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 10.7p to 6.4p.
The interim dividend was 3.5p.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong business at convenience stores helps
lift T&amp;S to Pounds 6.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;S STORES lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 6.79m in the
six months to July 3, helped by the strength of its convenience stores
business which offset falling margins at its core Supercigs discount
newsagents.
The shares fell from 166p to 160p as the company moved up to the standard
rate of tax which reduced earnings to 7.06p (7.69p). The interim dividend
goes up to 2.5p (2.4p). Total sales rose to Pounds 171.2m (Pounds 166.1m).
T&amp;S said full year results depend on its Supercigs initiatives launched at
the end of April.
The company had cut the cover prices of 150 magazines by between 5p and 20p
in 80 of its 210 (212) Supercigs stores and would extend the discounts to
100.
This, and a flexible multi-purchase confectionery promotion had lifted
transactions since the half year end. 'The number of transactions in
Supercigs at the end of June was down 5 per cent compared with this time
last year but has since climbed back up by 7.5 per cent,' said Mr Kevin
Threlfall, chairman.
Operating profits at Supercigs fell to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 2.04m) as
operating margins declined 10 per cent. Cigarettes, some 75 per cent of
Supercigs' sales, felt manufacturers price increases and increased tax which
pushed the price through the 'Pounds 2 barrier' in a market which shrank by
5 per cent over the period.
The Dillons convenience stores, now 102 (87) outlets, contributed operating
profits of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 1.99m). The Dillons confectionery, tobacco
and newsagents business contributed a static Pounds 2.55m.
The pre-tax figure reflected interest charges of Pounds 259,000 (Pounds
288,000) on short-term borrowings.
Profits on disposal dropped to Pounds 88,000 (Pounds 222,000).
Mr Stephen Boddice and Mr James McCarthy have been appointed joint managing
directors.
COMMENT
T&amp;S shares are held back by the group's dependence on the difficult UK
tobacco market and fears of a rights issue for acquisitions. It has
virtually ruled out the latter, and plans to reduce the proportion of
cigarette sales from 59 per cent to 50 per cent through internally funded
expansion of its convenience stores over the next four years. November's
budget presents the threat of another tax-led squeeze on tobacco margins
which would hold back Supercigs second half, notwithstanding its attempt to
extend discounts to all its non-cigarette goods. Stripping disposal gains,
pre-tax profits are forecast for Pounds 13.5m giving a multiple of 11 which
looks somewhat undervalued given the good performance of convenience stores
and management's ability to stimulate non-tobacco purchases in Supercigs.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 75m of HTR Japan with institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Touche Remnant announced yesterday that it had placed Pounds 75m
with institutions for its HTR Japanese Smaller Companies Trust. The trust -
the first new launch by the recently-merged fund management group - was
offered to the public yesterday. Henderson TR's aim is to raise Pounds 100m,
so Pounds 25m is available through the offer for subscription.
The offer consists of ordinary shares at 100p, with warrants attached on a
1-for-5 basis. The existence of the warrants, which will trade separately,
is a device designed to deal with the discount problem, since shares in
investment trusts often trade at a discount to net assets.
The warrants will have a value which should compensate investors for any
discount which occurs.
The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
The manager of the new trust, William Garnett, already runs Henderson
Horizon Japanese smaller companies, an offshore, open-ended fund.
Henderson TR believes that low interest rates and increased government
spending will help the Japanese economy to grow appreciably in 1994 and
1995.
The public offer closes at noon October 14 and dealings open on October 22.
The annual management fee will be 1 per cent, and 75 per cent of the
management and interest costs will be charged to the capital account.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Heron aims to settle Pounds 125m debt early
 -Asset disposals in UK exceed expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON, which completed its refinancing last Friday, expects to pay a
substantial part of a Pounds 125m debt repayment due on March 31 next year
within the next month or two as asset disposals in its UK business have
exceeded expectations in its business plan.
Its UK arm has already made a Pounds 25m initial payment early.
While Heron reports 'some improvement in market conditions in the UK' it is
facing deteriorating conditions in the continental European property market.
As a result, a pro-forma asset value of Pounds 12m shown in the refinancing
document has been restated at a deficit of Pounds 109m.
The difference on the balance sheet deficit is largely due to a Pounds 64m
provision against Spanish properties, and a Pounds 33m provision against
other continental European properties, mainly in France.
Heron said: 'The market values of the group's Spanish properties have
continued to fall significantly since the issue of the scheme document. The
oversupply in the Paris office market has similarly affected the values of
French properties.'
In the pro forma balance sheet the group's debt falls from Pounds 1.19bn to
Pounds 871m through the debt into equity swap. Heron has also deconsolidated
its US division with effect from March 31 1993, its financial year end.
Heron said it did not expect to recover any value from its investment in or
loans to the US division 'due to the considerable shortfall in asset values
available to meet existing liabilities to the creditors of the US division'.
Heron has restated the results for the year to end-March 1992 which were
shown in the refinancing document in unaudited form.
Since the auditors did not approve the accounts until this month, any events
up to that time had to be taken into account.
As a result, the group pre-tax loss for 1992 has risen from Pounds 301m to
Pounds 335m. The loss in 1993 was Pounds 172m, after exceptional items of
Pounds 125m - including a foreign exchange loss on its borrowings of Pounds
134m - and interest charges of Pounds 77m.
Net losses for 1992 originally shown at Pounds 693m rose to Pounds 826m -
reflecting the fall in property values between April this year, when the
figures in the refinancing document were agreed, and the date of the
auditors' approval. In 1993 the net loss was Pounds 174m.
The deficit on the 1992 balance sheet rose from an unaudited Pounds 328m to
Pounds 461m, and by the end of the latest financial year was Pounds 640m.
Losses were cut in Heron Motor Group and Heron Homes, while the property and
other commercial activities increased profits.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Severn Trent denies board split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERN TRENT yesterday denied allegations that a boardroom split had
resulted in the retirement of Mr John Bellak, its outspoken chairman and the
man who has guided the company from government-owned water authority to
quoted utility.
The company said Mr Bellak's retirement on March 31 followed board
discussions about management succession, begun in October last year. Mr
Roderick Paul, the chief executive, is due to retire in 1995.
Mr Paul said rumours of a row over strategy were 'completely untrue'. The
board had been anxious to put a management succession in place so 'we did
not have the chairman and chief executive retiring at the same time,' he
said.
Mr Bellak yesterday reinforced Mr Paul's denial. 'It's a load of balls,' he
said. 'I do not recall a single disagreement. The strategy . . . has always
had the support of a united board.'
Severn Trent is expected to announce Mr Bellak's successor within the next
two months. It is believed that nine potential candidates have been
approached, while the company's deputy chairman, Mr Richard Ireland, finance
director at Wolseley, is thought to be a strong candidate.
Some analysts and investors dismissed Severn Trent's attempts to project an
image of a unified board. 'It looked more like push than walk,' said one. He
suggested that perhaps Mr Bellak was paying the price for an aggressive, but
less-than-successful diversification strategy.
In 1990, Severn let its Pounds 74m hostile bid for Caird, the waste
management group, lapse leaving it with a Pounds 10m write-off and a 29.9m
per cent stake which it sold for less than the Pounds 16m it paid. Severn
has come under further criticism for its Pounds 212m purchase the following
year of Biffa, the waste management group previously owned by BET.
It is widely acknowledged that Severn overpaid for Biffa, and onerous
financing arrangements mean that a sale is currently unthinkable.
The company yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to Biffa, saying it had no
intention of selling the business. 'The problem really is that there is no
easy way out,' said one analyst.
Mr Bellak has long been an enthusiastic advocate of diversification. A
Czech-born refugee from Nazi Germany, he was appointed chairman 10 years
ago. He is widely regarded as a colourful character whose direct manner
often sparks vigorous discussion.
A keen sportsman, Mr Bellak said yesterday that he intended to go shooting
when he retired. 'April Fool's Day is no day to start anything new,' he
said.
It was also announced yesterday that Mr Victor Cocker, who has been tipped
as Mr Paul's replacement, will become deputy chief executive.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer cuts loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Computer Hold-ings, the computing services group undergoing
radical market repositioning, lost Pounds 5.89m pre-tax in the year to March
31.
Turnover was Pounds 58.2m against Pounds 157.9m for the previous 15 months
when losses amounted to Pounds 8.33m. Overhead costs, however, were halved
to Pounds 9.7m on a comparable basis.
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 365,000 to provide for the closure
of subsidiaries.
Losses per share were 7.4p (9.8p). No dividend is declared for the year
(1.25p for 15 months).
Mr John Small, chairman, said the reduction in turnover reflected a
substantial change in the pattern of group sales during the year. There had
been a sharp reduction in the volume of purchase and sale of second-user
mainframe computers, which had been the company's core business.
The company is now concentrating on computing services, which have a lower
sales value but offer a better quality of sustainable business and higher
profit margins.
During the year, the group entered a strategic alliance with Granada
Computer Services International, a provider of computer maintenance. Under
the terms of the alliance the two companies will work together to provide a
broad range of maintenance and information technology services.
Mr Small said early results for the current year showed an encouraging
improvement over the same period last year.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham Intl sells Portuguese subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM International, the property, hotels and nursing group which
tumbled to pre-tax losses of Pounds 62.5m in the six months to May 2 after a
Pounds 60m write-down in the value of its property, is to sell one of its
Portuguese subsidiaries for Pounds 9.9m.
This comes after Mr John Clark, chief executive, was granted on September 22
an option over 5m 10p shares, or 4.15 per cent of the issued capital, for
nil considera-tion.
The option is exercisable between March 14 1994 and September 13 2000. The
shares closed at 8 1/2 p last night.
Morlaix de Portugal Investimentos Hoteleiros e Turisticos, the Portuguese
offshoot which owns the Holiday Inn in Lisbon, is to be sold to Mr Marcal, a
Lisbon hotelier.
Of the total consideration Pounds 1.2m is deferred until December 31 1994.
Morlaix's book value is the same as the full consideration.
The sale is conditional, principally on the approval of the holders of
Buckingham's Pounds 33m convertible redeemable loan stock 1995, part of the
security for which is Morlaix.
Buckingham is controlled by Purlieus Investments, which in March made a
mandatory cash offer for the issued share capital not already owned by it or
parties acting in concert with it.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Matt Clark suspended pending further buy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Matthew Clark were yesterday suspended at 470p at the company's
request after the acquisitive British wines and mineral water company
confirmed weekend press disclosures that it was negotiating for its second
purchase this year.
The company is thought to be in talks over Grants of St James, Allied-Lyons'
upmarket wines business.
A statement issued by the Stock Exchange confirmed that negotiations
'regarding the possible purchase of certain businesses' were under way.
Matthew Clark refused to comment but the suspension lent credibility to the
suggestion that any acquisition might be part-funded by a share issue.
The talks come in the wake of the acquisition of Freetraders, the drinks
wholesaler, which was funded by a Pounds 12.9 rights issue in June, and the
purchase of Strathmore, the mineral water business, for Pounds 11m last
year.
Grants' wines business includes the Stowells of Chelsea box range, as well
as the Piemontello and Black Tower brands.
Grants also owns a wholesaling business which would fit well with
Freetraders.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Barclays' German arm loses Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCK, FINK, the German banking subsidiary of Barclays Bank of the UK, lost
DM59m (Pounds 23.6m) last year, it has emerged. This amounted to more than a
quarter of the Munich-based bank's equity and obliged it to make a highly
unusual formal announcement of its losses to the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur
Kreditwesen (BFK), the federal banking authority in Berlin.
This came to light over the weekend as details of the correspondence between
the bank and the BFK appeared in the German press. The correspondence took
place in January this year but no mention of the scale of the bank's losses
was made at its annual press conference this summer, where journalists were
left with the impression that the bank had made a profit in 1992.
Barclays, which bought Merck, Fink in the autumn of 1990 for an undisclosed
amount, said yesterday that it had made good the losses and that it was
happy with the performance of the bank. This month it invested a further
DM100m to take the German private bank's equity capital from DM200m to
DM300m.
Mr Geoffrey Kelly, a spokesman for Barclays in London, said last year's
losses were largely due to one-off factors, such as the costs of opening new
offices and provisioning for restructuring. Another factor was conservative
provisioning for bad and doubtful debts, Mr Kelly said.
In the first half of the current year, Merck, Fink made an operating profit
of DM15m. This figure is, however, calculated before provisions for bad and
doubtful debts - likely to be extensive given mounting credit risks amid
Germany's worst recession since the second world war.
Merck, Fink is one of a number of German private banks owned by UK clearing
banks. Midland Bank owns Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt and Lloyds owns Schoder,
Munchmeyer, Hengst. This summer Merck, Fink said it was planning to cut
staff by 12 per cent from 650 by the end of next year.
Merck, Fink said it expected profitability to be maintained in the second
half and it expected a satisfactory result for the full year.
It said the figures for the first half made it 'unmistakeably clear' that
reports of business difficulties at the bank were groundless.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Bristol &amp; West chief quits suddenly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; West, the UK's 10th largest building society, yesterday announced
the abrupt departure of Mr Tony FitzSimons as chief executive.
The society suffered a sharp rise in lending provisions last year, following
what industry analysts regard as over-ambitious lending in the south of the
UK between 1989 and 1991. .
Bristol &amp; West said Mr Fitz-Simons was resigning 'with immediate effect'.
His departure follows the appointment four months ago of Lord Armstrong of
Ilminster as chairman.
Since Mr FitzSimons's appointment in spring 1989, Bristol &amp; West has
suffered particularly high levels of bad debt during the housing recession,
while pursuing expansionist policies.
The society's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 39.1m last year, from Pounds
67.4m, as lending provisions nearly tripled to Pounds 74.1m from Pounds
24.5m. However, a recovery had begun in the first half of this year, with
interim pre-tax profits more than doubling to Pounds 20.4m, total mortgage
arrears falling 19 per cent and the ratio of cost to income substantially
reduced.
Mr FitzSimons could not be contacted yesterday. In a prepared statement, he
said: 'I have a number of interesting avenues I have wished to pursue and
hope that they will see fruition in the not too distant future.'
Bristol &amp; West said there were no immediate plans for a change of strategy
and stressed that it was financially strong.
Lord Armstrong said: 'Our first priority is to manage out the arrears, make
sure we maintain high quality and bring our costs down.' He added that the
society was 'looking for the possibility of mergers'.
Two long-standing Bristol &amp; West executives change positions as a result of
the resignation. Mr John Burke, business development director, becomes chief
executive and Mr Jeff Warren, finance director, becomes his deputy.
The society's most recent figures showed that 5.1 per cent of its mortgages
were more than 12 months in arrears, considerably above the industry norm.
While its competitors were reducing their number of branch offices, Bristol
&amp; West was investing heavily. Its total number rose from 171 in 1988 to 186
in 1991, before falling to 178 last year.
The 1992 report and accounts show that Mr FitzSimons, who was the
highest-paid director, received a salary of more than Pounds 195,000.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, said: 'He was
considered deal hungry and many investors have been worried that he could
'bet the bank' with some future deal.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / Getting to grips with the Green Giant: Guy de Jonquieres
explains the strategy changes at GrandMet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors drew two reassuring conclusions from the Pounds 175m restructuring
charge announced by Grand Metropolitan yesterday. It is seen as an attempt
by the UK-based food, drinks and retailing group to improve its
competitiveness, and evidence of efforts to extend Grand Met's successful
brand management skills from spirits to other businesses.
The fact that at least two thirds of the planned cost cuts will fall in the
US also marks an admission that the transatlantic expansion strategy
championed by Mr Ian Martin, the group's former managing director, has not
lived up to expectations.
Mr Martin, who last Friday lost the race to succeed Sir Allen Sheppard as
Grand Met's chairman, masterminded the Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.76bn)
acquisition of Pillsbury, the US food group in 1989 and was responsible for
improving its profitability substantially.
However, Pillsbury's recent performance has been much more uneven, partly
because of the impact last year of a sharp drop in fresh produce prices on
Green Giant, the frozen vegetable division which is Pillsbury's largest
business. Though prices recovered this year, after floods in the Midwest
destroyed much of the vegetable crop, Green Giant has been subjected to the
same intense pressures from the retail trade which have squeezed the margins
of many leading US food brands.
Green Giant has sought to re-build profits through increased marketing and
by extending its brand to fresh produce. But events of the past year have
underlined the difficulty of maintaining a large branded premium in a sector
closely tied to the commodity cycle and subject to growing own-label
competition.
GrandMet insisted yesterday that Green Giant had a good future and it did
not plan to sell it. However, the group also appears to have concluded that
scope for increasing prices is limited and that margin improvements will
have to rely heavily on cost reductions.
Some observers believe Mr George Bull, who has managed GrandMet's food
business for the past year, would have liked to adopt such a strategy
earlier but did not feel able to until he was promoted to group chief
executive on Friday.
How much of the planned savings Pillsbury will be able to hold on to is an
open question. As Mr John Wakely of Lehman Brothers pointed out yesterday,
fierce retail competition is forcing many US food companies to hand over
many efficiency gains to supermarkets in the form of promotional cash
payments.
The restructuring of Pearle Vision is the second big shake-up of the US
optical retailer since it was acquired by GrandMet in 1985. It follows two
years of losses, as budget-conscious consumers have spent less on the
spectacle frames which provide most of Pearle's profits.
Mr Kevin Feeney of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite argues that the
acquisition was always flawed. 'GrandMet thought it was buying a chain of
opticians, when what it actually acquired was a fashion business.'
Pearle has also looked an increasingly odd fit in recent years as GrandMet
has sharpened its focus on internationally branded businesses - all the more
because efforts to transfer Pearle's formula to the UK have been
disappointing.
The general assumption yesterday was that Pearle was being restored to
profitability as a prelude to its eventual sale - an interpretation which
GrandMet did not go out of its way to discourage. Though most analysts
welcomed that prospect yesterday, many questioned the logic of injecting a
further Pounds 60m into a business which has recently contributed nothing to
group profits and which may not remain in the fold much longer.

FT  28 SEP 93 / SAS head leaves for Alcazar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAN CARLZON yesterday resigned as chief executive of Scandinavian
Airlines System, a post he had held for 12 years, to concentrate on the
alliance between SAS, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian
Airlines.
The surprise move was a clear attempt by SAS and Mr Carlzon to add momentum
to the so-called Alcazar project, which has slipped well behind the schedule
the four airlines set for themselves when they announced their alliance
plans in April this year.
'It is not our intention to put pressure on our partners, but it is our
intention to show that we really mean business,' Mr Carlzon said.
'We have put a lot of effort into this project and we really believe it is
the best solution for SAS and our partners in the long term.'
Mr Carlzon said he would not resume his position as president and chief
executive if the Alcazar project failed, saying he would not be suited to
running what would be a 'stand-alone' SAS that would then be forced to
contract.
The Swedish, Danish and Norwegian-owned airline, which has been in loss for
the past three years, further underlined its commitment to the alliance plan
by appointing as Mr Carlzon's successor Mr Jan Reinas, head of SAS Norway.
He is due to leave SAS to become president of Norske Skog, the Norwegian
pulp and paper company, next April, about the time Alcazar would be launched
if it was agreed.
SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines said they intended to forge a
merged operation, with a single management structure and balance sheet, by
next year when they unveiled the alliance plan in the spring. They envisaged
creating a 'fourth force' among European airlines to compete with British
Airways, Air France and Lufthansa.
Who will head the new group is among problems still to be resolved.
Mr Carlzon is clearly a candidate. But both he and SAS said only that he
would 'join Alcazar's senior management if the negotiations are positive'.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Ford gives Jaguar extra Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US car producer, is injecting another Pounds 300m of equity
capital into Jaguar in addition to the Pounds 255m already put into the UK
luxury car company, which it bought for Pounds 1.56bn in 1989.
The US parent has been forced to recapitalise Jaguar in the face of the UK
company's continuing heavy losses. As part of this action, it has chosen to
transform about Pounds 180m of inter-company debt into equity to improve the
Jaguar balance sheet.
Ford has been forced to inject new equity capital into Jaguar in each of the
last three years. According to Jaguar's annual report, filed at Companies
House, Ford provided Pounds 120m in two tranches last year following the
injection of Pounds 135m in 1991.
These contributions have been eaten up by Jaguar's continuing losses. It
suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 189.5m last year after losses of Pounds
226.1m in 1991, Pounds 66.2m in 1990 and Pounds 58.3m in 1989.
The annual report discloses that the company incurred a restructuring charge
of Pounds 21.4m for redundancies last year in addition to Pounds 42.5m in
1991. Jaguar's UK workforce was reduced to 6,481 at the end of 1992 from
7,520 a year earlier and 11,661 at the end of 1990.
Its losses have been reduced this year as output has risen to meet a
recovery in demand in the US and the UK. Its first-half pre-tax loss was
reduced to Pounds 77.2m from Pounds 88.3m.
Jaguar's improving fortunes in the US are expected to help increase
worldwide sales this year by about 29 per cent to more than 29,000 from the
22,478 achieved last year. Sales are forecast to exceed 30,000 in 1994,
despite the continuing recession in Europe.
Mr Michael Dale, president of Jaguar's US subsidiary, said last week that
sales in the US in 1994 could exceed 15,000 - compared with an expected
13,000 this year and 8,600 in 1992 - accounting for roughly 50 per cent of
Jaguar's worldwide sales volume.
Jaguar had not yet reached its break-even production level, which was now
'in the low 30,000 range', he said.
Turnover last year declined by 4.9 per cent to Pounds 659.4m.
Research and development spending rose to Pounds 66.2m last year, from
Pounds 54.4m, as Jaguar worked on the renewal of its model range for the
mid-1990s. This will be led by the launch next year of its revamped XJ6
luxury saloon.
Capital spending totalled Pounds 46.2m last year, compared with Pounds 70m
in 1990.
The report also showed that Jaguar paid Mr Nicholas Scheele, chairman and
chief executive, Pounds 144,652 in 1992 - about half the Pounds 285,082 paid
to his predecessor Mr Bill Hayden in 1991.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Heron ahead on debt repayments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading company, is ahead of schedule
on debt repayments agreed in its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing completed last
Friday. But deteriorating conditions in continental European property
markets mean 'the risk of not meeting both the short and long-term
obligations has increased', it said yesterday.
Heron said the directors 'remain satisfied that there is a reasonable
prospect that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations'.
Following the completion of the refinancing, Lord Boardman, former chairman
of NatWest Bank, has become chairman of Heron as expected. Heron also
announced the appointment as non-executive director of Mr Lionel Ross, who
was finance director of Whitbread until 1990.
Trading started in new securities issued to replace Heron's bonds. The
senior debt opened on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange at 50 per cent and
closed at 61 per cent of face value. Junior debt was quoted at 10 to 15 per
cent, while the shares were quoted at 4p to 8p.
Results for the year to March, published yesterday, showed that the
refinancing costs had risen to Pounds 74m. At one stage in the refinancing,
which took 18 months, Heron told advisers it would stop paying fees as they
were mounting too rapidly.
The group returned to profit at the operating level with a surplus of Pounds
30m, compared with a loss of Pounds 188m the previous year. After interest
of Pounds 77m and exceptional items of Pounds 125m, there was a net loss of
Pounds 174m.

FT  28 SEP 93 / No backtracking on 'open skies' policy, says Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission told the 12 EC member states and European flag
airlines yesterday there would be no going back on the Community's 'open
skies' regime, agreed last year to deregulate and promote greater
competition in air transport.
At a special meeting in Brussels last night where EC transport ministers
discussed the financial crisis in civil aviation with industry
representatives, Brussels stood on its EC treaty rights to police
competition and took an uncompromising line.
'There is no question of backtracking, and I've made that absolutely plain,'
said Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner. 'What some of (the
airlines) are after apparently is a price cartel,' he added, 'and that we
cannot and will not allow. We won't accept a fare cartel or a capacity
reduction cartel.'
On the table at the meeting was a working paper from the Belgian presidency
of the EC, calling for the reintroduction of passenger capacity-sharing
between airlines, and suggesting for the first time EC funding for airlines
in trouble and for air transport infrastructure.
But a return to collusion on passenger quotas between airlines was ruled out
by a big majority of member states, as was co-operation on price-setting. Mr
Van Miert ruled out the possibility of EC funding. He remarked on 'a certain
nostalgia' among airlines for the cosy, state-bankrolled cartels that
existed before EC liberalisation.
On the day that the French transport ministry announced it was earmarking
FFr5bn (Pounds 581m) for a further recapitalisation of Air France, the
troubled state-owned airline, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister,
said he was encouraged that all airline industry representatives at the
meeting condemned state aids as adding to overcapacity.
Mr Van Miert, who as transport commissioner until this year approved big
cash injections into Sabena, the Belgian state carrier, Air France, and
Iberia, the Spanish flag airline, reaffirmed the doctrine that these were
'last-chance' agreements.
The Belgian Socialist commissioner said the criterion was that 'there has to
be a credible plan for returning the company to viability', and that if
those plans turned out badly, there would be no second chance.
Mr Van Miert said pending rulings on state aids for Aer Lingus, Olympic
Airways, and Air France, were the responsibility of the transport
commissioner.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Clinton says US will continue to shoulder leading world role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday rebutted speculation that his
administration might be turning to isolationism by promising that 'the US
intends to remain engaged and to lead'.
Addressing the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly, he
also said the US would press for a strengthening of UN peacekeeping
capabilities and seek to reinforce international agreements to prevent the
spread of weapons of mass destruction.
But his central message was that the US would use its unique position in
world affairs 'to expand and strengthen the world's community of
market-based democracies'. He implied that the main instrument for this
objective would be support for trade liberalisation.
He said the US would seek to 'enlarge the circle of nations that live with
free institutions', and promised that the administration would seek to
strengthen free market democracies by 'revitalising our economy at home, by
opening world trade through the Gatt and the North America Free Trade
Agreement'.
Mr Clinton argued that support for market democracies would serve US
security interests as well as the goals of the UN. 'Broadly-based prosperity
is the strongest form of preventive diplomacy,' he said. 'The habits of
democracy are the habits of peace.'
Mr Clinton praised the expansion of the UN's peacekeeping activities in
recent years, but did so in terms which remained well short of unqualified
support. 'Today there is a wide recognition that the UN's peacekeeping
capabilities have not kept pace with its rising responsibilities,' he said,
calling for the creation of a modern UN peacekeeping headquarters with a
planning staff, access to intelligence, a logistics unit and an operations
centre.
At the same time, he warned that the UN should in future be more cautious
before embarking on peacekeeping activities, and clearly indicated that the
US had no intention of 'subcontracting' its foreign policy to the UN.
In the past six years, the number of UN peacekeepers deployed worldwide had
risen from 10,000 to 80,000. In future, said Mr Clinton, the UN should ask
itself much harder questions before embarking on additional peacekeeping
operations, such as: 'Is there a real threat to international peace? Does
the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an end point to UN
participation be identified? How much will the mission cost?'
Mr Clinton promised that the US would 'within the next few weeks' be up to
date with its peacekeeping bills, on which it owes arrears of some Dollars
800m (Pounds 530m). But he reiterated the US demand that the UN's
contribution assessment system, which has remained unchanged since 1973,
should be revised to take account of the relative decline in the US share of
world wealth.

FT  28 SEP 93 / First BCCI conviction as Akbar admits Dollars 745m fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST criminal conviction over the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International was secured yesterday when Mr Syed Ali Akbar, the
former head of the bank's Treasury division, admitted 16 charges of false
accounting involving more than Dollars 745m (Pounds 484m) of depositors'
misused money.
The case, brought by Britain's Serious Fraud Office, marks the first success
for authorities in Britain, the US and Abu Dhabi which are now trying to
bring a series of prosecutions concerning alleged frauds in the bank's
handling of clients' funds.
The only previous case to come to court - the trial in New York of US lawyer
Mr Robert Altman - ended in his acquittal in August.
Presenting the case for the SFO, Mr Timothy Langdale QC told an Old Bailey
judge that the charges Mr Akbar had admitted to were only sample ones. The
amount of depositors' money misused by BCCI officials was now thought to
total Pounds 1.3bn, he said.
The Treasury department which Mr Akbar had controlled was responsible for
some 60 per cent of the bogus transactions used to conceal the bank's
insolvency and to create the impression of profitability, he said.
Mr Akbar reported directly to BCCI's two most senior figures - Mr Agha
Hassan Abedi, its chairman and founder, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its chief
executive. However, his department was the 'engine room' of the bank and he
was the 'chief engineer' behind the frauds, Mr Langdale said.
Mr Akbar is to be sentenced later today. He has already spent more than two
years in jails in France and the UK. He was arrested in France after fleeing
Britain soon after being released from prison after serving an 18 month
sentence for laundering drug money.

The question unanswered by yesterday's interim statement is what terms
Hammerson will offer for enfranchising its restricted voting shares. The
broad hint from the company is that the 10 per cent price differential
between its two classes of shares before May's rights issue will be taken as
evidence of what full voting rights are worth. Ordinary shareholders might
thus expect something like a 1-for-10 bonus issue by way of compensation.
But there is doubtless room for haggling. Since the differential had shrunk
to 8 per cent by yesterday's close, the market may now be anticipating
something less.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: US listings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's desire for its companies to be listed in New York without
conforming to US accounting standards is both silly and cheeky. Mr Theo
Waigel, finance minister, argued at the IMF meeting that German companies
should be able to list unconditionally in the US because US companies can
list in Germany. But such an unsubtle view of reciprocity ignores the
well-established principle of national treatment in international commercial
relations. This decrees that countries should grant access to foreign
companies on the basis of treatment no better or worse than they accord to
their own companies.
There is no reason why national treatment should not apply in this case.
Indeed, to allow German companies preferential treatment would be
counter-productive. It would dilute the integrity of the New York market.
Moreover, without improved disclosure, German companies will find it hard to
attract their fair share of international capital wherever they are listed.
It is no use their huffily complaining that without more concessions none of
them will want to follow Daimler-Benz to New York. Theirs will be the
greater loss in the long run if they elect not to.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's statement from Grand Metropolitan at least showed the market was
wrong in worrying about a Guinness-style disappointment on the trading
front. But there is a bitter-sweet message in the accompanying disclosure
that the group is to take a Pounds 175m charge for restructuring. The
positive aspect is that it is getting to grips with Green Giant, the
vegetable business acquired as part of the Pillsbury deal. GrandMet also
appears to be dressing up Pearle for sale.
That will help ease gearing pressure when it eventually happens. But the
provisions will eat into cash flow meanwhile. Nor does it help that the
company has given no details of how it will use Pounds 50m of yesterday's
charge. Perhaps it must slim down other businesses before they can be sold
at a reasonable price.
Some reorganisation spend was inevitable to shield Green Giant from the
effects of vegetable price fluctuations. GrandMet's slowness in grasping the
commodity nature of this business will hardly have counted in favour of Mr
Ian Martin, who was responsible for the Pillsbury acquisition but lost the
contest for the chief executive's job. Separating the two announcements by
just a weekend does little to dispel the idea that they were in some way
connected.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: European Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, the decision of Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS's president, to step
down in order to work on the proposed pan-European alliance looks like a
rescue mission. The delay in signing an agreement with Swissair, KLM, and
Austrian Airlines suggests some fundamental stumbling blocks, and Mr Carlzon
has staked particular credibility on the project. Austrian is still being
openly courted by Lufthansa, so there must be a chance that at least the
junior partner will drop out.
But losing Austrian need not scupper a deal among the remaining three.
Framing an agreement to satisfy four airlines, six national governments and
innumerable trade unions always looked likely to take longer than the
original timetable allowed. Decisions over job losses and where to site head
office are politically charged. There is scope for disagreement over
ownership. With the strongest balance sheet and newest fleet, Swissair in
particular may feel entitled to more than the 30 per cent share originally
envisaged.
The main reason for optimism is that all three larger airlines badly need a
deal. A strong balance sheet does not compensate for Swissair's lack of
critical mass. SAS has the largest and most secure home market, but
geography makes it weak in international markets. Burdened by debt - and
with the memory of its abortive attempt to link with BA still fresh - KLM
wants safety in numbers. Mr Carlzon's prophecy that there will be five
European airlines by the turn of the century still looks correct.

FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Crude solutions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pain among Opec producers has clearly been enough to provoke some kind
of discipline. Doubtless, there will still be squabbles about the detail of
how the overall production ceiling is divided, and a modest degree of
overproduction is only to be expected. Still, it is some measure of the
discomfort that all of the cartel's members seem likely to be included in
the new arrangements and that Saudi Arabia and Iran are trying to reach an
understanding. It can only help prices that, in the short term, capacity
constraints probably preclude serious cheating.
Yet all that will do little more than keep the market in rough balance. And
a modest rally in prices from Dollars 16 a barrel is hardly the stuff of
which oil producers' fortunes will be made. The underlying weakness of
Opec's position is shown by the lack of progress on planning to accommodate
Iraqi oil. Full rehabilitation of Iraq is clearly still some distance away,
but the market may have to absorb 500,000 barrels a day of Iraqi crude in
1994 if the UN agrees a deal on humanitarian aid. Beyond that, Opec
negotiators will have an eye to the extra 2m barrels a day which will flow
from Iraq once it is fully back on stream.
Unless there is a dramatic increase in western demand, chronic weakness in
oil prices seems the most likely prognosis. But that would not mean outright
collapse. Conventional wisdom argues that Opec is at its most solid when
hard pressed. An early return of Iraqi oil might be the best thing that
could happen to the cartel.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Clouds in EC open skies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an air of the predictable, as well as of the melodramatic, in the
dispute among EC governments and airlines about solving the financial
problems of the European aviation industry. On the liberal side of the ring
are the UK and the Netherlands, champions of airline free enterprise, and
critics of subsidies and restrictive practices which help make scheduled EC
air fares on many routes 50 per cent higher than US levels. In the opposing
corner is a larger group of member states with loss-making national
carriers, proposing extra regulations and government cash to alleviate the
hardships of the recession.
The gap in attitudes extends beyond the sector's specific difficulties. In
statements which appear to advertise the UK government's reasons for not
signing the EC social chapter, British Airways' continental rivals say that
relatively low UK social charges diminish their ability to compete.
In a European industry with a diverse structure and history, beset by the
common handicap of inadequate airport infrastructure, and facing likely
consolidation into a smaller number of large global carriers, the search for
a common policy is fraught with difficulty. However, unless the EC avoids
the dangers of fragmentation and diversion along its path to liberalisation,
the ultimate beneficiaries of the process - consumers - will not reap full
advantage.
This month's Brussels hearings by the EC's committee of 'wise men' into
airline problems have illustrated the nature of these challenges. Three
agreements on EC air liberalisation during the past six years have generated
a level of competition which, along with over-capacity induced by the
late-1980s aircraft order boom, is forcing less efficient carriers to carry
out slimming and lay-offs.
Rightly rejected
Yesterday's proposal by Belgium, the current EC president, to reintroduce
passenger capacity quotas runs contrary to the spirit of EC airline
liberalisation. The suggestion was rightly rejected last night by the EC
Commission. Yet the political will on the continent to tone down what are
viewed as the effects of untrammelled deregulation should not be
underestimated.
Belgium's initiative was given tacit support by other countries, including
France. Several airlines are mounting requests for fresh state aid,
including Belgium's financially troubled Sabena, as well as the Spanish and
Portuguese carriers. The Irish government, a traditional liberalising force
in aviation, is seeking approval to grant Aer Lingus IPounds 175m in extra
funds, in a package involving extensive job cuts.
Counter-attack
Meanwhile Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman, has stated that the
British liberalisation crusade is partly based on hypocrisy, claiming that
the UK's 1977 air traffic agreement with the US gives Britain unfair
advantages. Mr Attali's claim deserves study. The old airline accords by
Germany and France with the US allowed American airlines much greater access
to Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle airports than allowed to Heathrow by the
1977 agreement. Yet Mr Attali's counter-attack also illustrates the
difficulty of looking at European airlines' predicament in anything but a
global context.
The drive towards international airline partnerships and mergers is so
advanced that a retreat to the previous system of national protection would
be unfeasible and unwise. As a centrepiece of its competition policy, the EC
has no choice but to encourage loss-making airlines to carry through further
restructuring. Although this will require some smaller European airlines to
merge or close in coming years, the industry will be in a better shape to
face the next business cycle.
Difficulties caused by variations in EC airlines' economic environments can
best be tackled through privatisation. This path can be trodden only after
restructuring decisions of the sort taken by Lufthansa and Air France are
implemented. Over the longer term, to prevent US airlines from winning undue
advantage, the EC should work towards taking over responsibility for
transatlantic air traffic accords. That goal, however, will require a great
deal more EC harmony than is currently evident; it can be reached only at
the end of a struggle which has just begun.

But there were no such concerns at the nearby Scotch Whisky Association

The vultures have been circling Liverpool for a couple of years awaiting the
passing of Sir John Moores, inventor of football pools and founder of the
privately-owned Littlewoods retailing empire.
Now the patriarch is gone, and the City eyes Littlewoods as a juicy
flotation candidate. But first up for grabs is likely to be Everton Football
Club, Sir John's great love, where the few Everton shares outside the
family's control have turned to gold-dust in anticipation of a scramble.
One senior Liverpool partner of a leading national accountancy practice
recently surprised fellow diners with his efforts to buy some shares from a
new acquaintance seated across the table, while a well-known academic and
Everton supporter is coyly waiting in the wings with a consortium which he
says will bid soon.
Everton would not come cheap. On top of the Pounds 4m or so that would be
needed to buy the Moores family interests, there is an estimated Pounds 3m
to clear debts and up to another Pounds 4m to buy some better players.
Favourite to enter the bidding is Peter Johnson, chairman of Park Foods, the
Wirral-based Christmas hamper company, and owner of the swimming pool where
former Merseyside assistant chief constable Alison Halford had her famous
dip.
Johnson already owns Tranmere Rovers, the Birkenhead first division side,
which he would have to unload. So far he's still denying any such plans.

What an ideal local government ombudsman Edward Osmotherly will make. A top
mandarin at the Transport department, he was progenitor of the infamous
'Osmotherly rules' that govern the appearance of civil servants in front of
parliamentary select committees.
The rules say that since it is ministers rather than civil servants who are
answerable to parliament, civil servants should tell MPs only what the
minister wants them to know. Professor Peter Hennessy, the doyen of
Whitehall watchers, describes the rules as 'the 60 ways of saying 'I can't
answer that question' on which Whitehall relies to see off the curious'.
Knowledge of such procedural wheezes should prove invaluable in Osmotherly's
new task of exposing maladministration in local government.

Successful overseas industrialists could be forgiven for asking why Britain
tarried well into the final decade of the 20th century before setting up a
Foundation for Manufacturing Industry (FMI). Observer merely wishes to point
out that almost everything else has been tried to breathe life into the
country's ailing widget-makers.
The idea for the FMI, which dovetails neatly into the current Lord Mayor's
City and Industry in Partnership campaign, in fact stemmed largely from
Kenneth Adams, former Comino Fellow at the Royal Society of Arts. Three
years ago Adams wrote about the 'nonsense' that Christians cheerfully pray
for farmers at harvest festival but 'do not pray for successful production
in manufacturing and extractive industry or for successful achievement in
commerce'. His campaign to involve a higher being having yielded
insufficient results, he was obviously forced to turn to the earthly powers
of FMI's new chairman, Sir Trevor Holdsworth.

<TEXT>
After almost two years of trading insults, Investcorp and Maurizio Gucci
have struck a deal, the most intriguing part of which has Gucci emerging as
an adviser to the Bahrain-based merchant bank.
In July, Investcorp, which had 50 per cent of the shares in the luxury goods
company, instigated legal action against Gucci, who had management control
and the remaining stake; it alleged mismanagement and breach of contract by
dint of his having pledged his shares to a bank.
Not the most propitious start for an enduring relationship, so the post may
therefore simply be a face-saving exercise.
So, if Gucci is not to be too preoccupied achieving synergies between
Investcorp's growing clutch of luxury goods companies, what will he do now
that he is some Dollars 170m the richer?
Callers to Gucci's plush Milan headquarters yesterday could be forgiven for
thinking they had been misrouted. Barely 48 hours after the ink was dry, the
former chairman appeared little more than a memory at the firm which bears
his name.
The persistent might now try St Moritz, that repository of idle
multi-millionaires, where Gucci maintains a home.
While the skiing may not have started yet, it's not a bad place for counting
banknotes.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Hong Kong's one for the road: A superhighway link with China
is a symbol of growing confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The map on Gordon Wu's wall says it all. A floor-to-ceiling projection of
Guangdong's Pearl river delta shows the path of a 305km motorway Mr Wu is
building between Hong Kong and Macao via Guangzhou, the capital of China's
most dynamic economic region.
Although much delayed, mostly by bureaucratic hurdles, the road's 123km
first phase should be carrying traffic by the end of the year, according to
Mr Wu. Fresh from a 120mph spin on the newly laid asphalt - there will be no
speed limit - he says: 'I can't wait to do it in a Corvette.'
Mr Wu's 'superhighway' is, however, no pleasure-run. Apart from being a
crucial link between China and its gateway to the west, Hong Kong, the road
 -and its developer - symbolise the confidence with which business is
betting on China's future as a market economy. It is also a case study of
how things get done in China.
Viewed from a political angle, however, it is precisely this enmeshing of
Hong Kong's economy with the mainland that is undermining governor Chris
Patten's efforts to promote democracy in the colony before the handover to
China in 1997.
The governor says this autumn will be crucial in resolving Britain's impasse
with Beijing over Hong Kong's political development. On Friday, Mr Douglas
Hurd, UK foreign secretary, holds an important meeting in New York with Mr
Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart.
But what is clear is that, apart from Beijing's opposition to his plans for
more democracy in the colony, Mr Patten faces a corrosive rebellion by the
Hong Kong business class if Britain and China fail to agree a way forward.
Business, which has pervasive influence in Hong Kong, thinks Mr Patten has
got it wrong.
Mr Wu, reflecting the predominant view in the Chinese business community,
states bluntly the case that expatriates prefer to whisper in private. 'Mr
Patten is a nice guy and he means well, but he should be a bit more
patient,' he says. 'A small place like Hong Kong cannot fight communism with
guns or words. Our biggest and only opportunity is to work with them gently
and concentrate on the economy, saying to them: 'That's the way you will get
the goodies.' '
The road that Mr Wu is building goes right to the heart of these issues. He
says the idea first occurred to him on a visit to Guangdong in 1979 - a year
after Deng Xiaoping, now 89, assumed power in China and began the process of
opening up the country.
The decisive moment, however, was the Tiananmen Square massacre of June
1989, which led to a foreign investment freeze and made China's top leaders
eager to encourage projects such as Mr Wu's road. It was only then that
anyone paid serious attention to his financial and traffic projections,
enabling him to raise Dollars 800m from a consortium of banks to stand
alongside the Dollars 200m of equity supplied by his own company, Hopewell
Holdings, a construction conglomerate with interests ranging from house
building to power stations. The banks were offered an eight-year pay-back,
on the basis of traffic projections rising from 15,000 to 35,000 vehicles a
day over that period.
In China every stage of this process required months of negotiation with
provincial officials. Mr Wu tried holding out for total control over the
construction work but eventually conceded that the Chinese would take
responsibility for two stretches of the first phase. He did, however, win
the argument in favour of a six, rather than four, lane highway, arguing
that an extra two lanes would add only 19 per cent to the cost of a
four-lane road.
On tolls, he agreed a figure of 10 US cents per car per kilometre, only for
the Chinese authorities to change their minds and ask him to raise the
figure to 12 cents. Mr Wu did get his way on quality standards, using
British engineers and importing steel, cement and asphalt from around the
world. China supplied the labour.
The result is a road capable of bearing trucks with maximum loads of 16
tonnes an axle, greater than anything required by existing commercial
traffic.
Financially, phase one of the deal looks like a winner. Mr Wu is now
confident that 30,000 vehicles a day will be diverted from the dusty,
truck-choked roads of the Pearl river delta. He calculates that the banks
will have their loans repaid in only four years. In the first decade, net
profits after maintenance - for which Hopewell has the contract - are to be
divided 60:40 between Guangdong and Hopewell. For years 11 to 30, the split
is 70:30.
But for all of Mr Wu's high-level political contacts, he has not had his way
on phase two. Having been unable to agree a satisfactory work split with his
partners, he has conceded the original route to the Chinese and mapped out a
rival route about 30km to the east.
For this road he expects land acquisition to be completed by the end of this
year. Though riskier, the potential returns to Hopewell are commensurately
higher. He will earn 100 per cent of any net return in the first decade and
50 per cent thereafter.
The political pitfalls are obvious, perhaps explaining why Hopewell shares
have missed out on Hong Kong's bull market since 1992. In stockbroker
language, Hopewell is seen as a 'medium-term China infrastructure play', not
the sort of stock to yield short-term rewards for investors.
According to businessmen, political calm is required to transform China
through economic contact. Mr Wu adds that the key to a successful project is
support at the right level, which in China still means Beijing. That is how
he has navigated his way through the obfuscation and corruption for which
the Chinese bureaucracy is notorious. 'Corruption is everywhere,' he says.
The villains, he claims, are at the middle levels of the bureaucracy, where
he has found himself under pressure to procure materials of questionable
quality and provenance. 'I get ahead in China because I have the support of
top people and because they think what I do is good for the country. I don't
pay, so I don't get much help from the middle guys.'
Corruption, he maintains, is petty by some standards; a matter not of Swiss
bank accounts, more of providing cars and overseas study opportunities for
the children of Communist party officials. Mr Wu does, however, think that
the Chinese authorities are starting to crack down. 'I would not be
surprised to see executions,' he says.
He is not squeamish about China's system of law and order. But it would be
wrong to dismiss Mr Wu as an Asian tycoon ignorant of western political
concepts. Educated at Princeton, he named his son after Thomas Jefferson,
author of the Declaration of Independence. Arguing for a slower pace of
political change in Hong Kong, he rattles through two centuries of US
history since Jefferson's declaration: the emancipation of the slaves in the
1860s, women's suffrage in the 1920s, and the civil rights movement in the
1950s.
'Democracy is a very nice word and I believe in it,' he says. 'But these
changes should take place over time and not overnight. Mr Patten should be
more patient. The House of Lords is still an appointed body after 700 years;
why should people worry about functional constituencies being made up from
select groups of people?'
This is a reference to the complex internal mechanics of the colony's
Legislative Council, its 60-strong law-making body, only a third of which
will be popularly elected by 1997. Mr Patten faces a battle this autumn to
push through a timetable for enhanced accountability, having already watered
down his proposals to a point where one important faction of LegCo, headed
by lawyer Mr Martin Lee, says that democracy has been betrayed.
No one can yet tell whether, or how, London and Beijing will settle their
differences. But anxiety is growing that they may not do so this year or
perhaps at all, leaving the colony to lurch into Chinese ownership without a
sustainable advance in democratic procedures.
The point, still difficult to grasp for spectators in western democracies,
is that most business leaders view the 1997 handover with equanimity. It is
for this reason that many in the business community have ceased trying to
persuade Mr Patten to change course.
Asked what is his biggest concern about the fateful date, Mr Wu replies:
'Nothing, really. I don't believe China will revert to the communist planned
economy thing.'
Nor does he accept that Beijing's accession will import the corruption he
has wrestled with in Guangdong. Not many in Hong Kong would agree with him.
Indeed, spreading corruption is the main fear of a Hong Kong middle class
that does not have high-level Beijing connections or the financial resources
of top business people.
Mr Wu says that within 15 years China will resemble, but on an enormous
scale, Taiwan, which has moved in recent years from a plainly authoritarian
to a recognisably plural society. The key to this development, he says, has
been the influence of young Taiwanese educated abroad, who now have seats in
the commanding heights of politics and the economy. The same process is
under way throughout China.
Not even the death of Deng is seen as altering this course. 'Deng will be
sadly missed: he's a great man. Deng and Gorbachev are the great guys of the
century. But for China the die is cast.'
This leads the conversation back to Thomas J Wu. Fresh from graduation at
Princeton - where he has capped his father's grade Cs in engineering with a
row of As - TJ, says his father, will probably do a couple of years in the
engine room of someone else's business and then perhaps graduate school. But
his father's idea of his future in post-1997 Hong Kong could not be clearer.
'I would like him to be running this company.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / No particular Asian cocktail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten counters his critics in the Hong Kong business world with
the argument that the colony's economy cannot prosper after 1997 without
some kind of democratic underpinning. He accuses his opponents of
appeasement, write Ian Hargreaves and Simon Holberton.
'I think the divide is much more clearly between those who think we should
actually stand up for Hong Kong and those who think we shouldn't have a
bottom line except to do what China wants,' said the Hong Kong governor.
'But would the business community actually think we'd be better served if I
had to spend my time explaining to interested American pension funds, when
they come through Hong Kong, how a batch of (undemocratic) arrangements for
elections in Hong Kong were really going to enable us to maintain the rule
of law and Hong Kong's values after 1997?'
In an interview in his office at Government House, Mr Patten argued that
democracy and the rule of law are inseparable, disputing the idea that there
is a 'particular Asian cocktail' which delivers prosperity without political
rights.
'I don't happen to believe that,' he said. 'The notion, which is sometimes
advanced by Lee Kuan Yew (former Singapore prime minister) and others, that
somehow democracy helps to blunt economic prospects and growth in Asia and
elsewhere, doesn't seem to be an argument that is applied very obviously to
Japan. Korea and Taiwan are both emerging as much closer to participative
multi-party democracies than the sort of benign authoritarianism that
existed there before.'
An accountable and credible government in Hong Kong would underpin business,
not weaken it, he asserted. 'If we agree to rig the election in 1995, that
won't produce political stability in Hong Kong in 1997 - anything but - and
it is exceptionally short-sighted not to recognise that. Second, it will
harm the prospects of the rule of law surviving 1997. I think that would
open the door to corruption, I think it would open the door for the flight
of capital. If Hong Kong is no different from anywhere else on the (south
China) coast, why stay here, why do business here, why give Hong Kong a
better credit rating?'
Did he not find it remarkable that a former chairman of the UK Conservative
party, appointed to the governorship of a colony built on commerce, should
be so at odds with the business community? Did this not weaken Britain's
negotiating position with Beijing?
'I don't think it makes any difference to our negotiating stance,' said Mr
Patten. 'I'd much prefer it if I had the unanimous support of the business
community. What I'm delighted about is that I still seem to have substantial
support in the community at large. I'd be more worried if everyone in the
business community thought I was doing a terrific job and hardly anyone in
the community thought I was.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Debt relief cannot wait
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPPORTUNITY will go begging in Washington this week. Without a radical
initiative to reduce sub-Saharan Africa's external debt burden, there is
little chance of relieving the region's deepening economic crisis. On that
issue, at least, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Oxfam,
the international aid agency, can all agree. The onus should now be on
developed countries' finance ministers to put this premise into practice.
Yet no new African debt initiative looks likely to materialise. The British
government has declared, once more, that it will lobby this week for debt
reduction for low-income countries, using a formula which Prime Minister
John Major proposed in Trinidad over three years ago. Past experience does
not suggest it will have much success.
Meanwhile, growth in Africa continues to stagnate, the debt burden is rising
and the chance of the region's creditors, now mainly individual governments,
receiving repayments is receding. Sub-Saharan Africa's debt stock has risen
from some Pounds 60bn in 1980 to over Dollars 183bn today, more than the
value of the region's gross domestic product, as Mr Lewis Preston, president
of the World Bank, pointed out in the FT yesterday. Servicing this debt now
consumes 25 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's export earnings, far higher
than in any other region.
This debt service imposes an intolerable burden on many African economies,
sucking abroad resources which should be being invested at home. And that is
only part of the problem. Debt relief has become Africa's obsession. Finance
ministers and World Bank officials alike seem to spend an inordinate amount
of their time lobbying for rescheduling and reduction, at the expense of
implementing and monitoring the detail of reform programmes upon which
future progress depends.
Flawed strategy
The developed country's current strategy is flawed. According to the World
Bank, the Trinidad terms - a two-thirds write-off of bilateral government
debt of low-income countries - are still not enough to ensure that many
African countries can service external debts in the medium and long term. It
cannot make sense to make relief conditional on governments first
implementing economic programmes which their debt burden make unsustainable.
In any case, success is inadequately rewarded. Even Ghana, which has pursued
a recovery programme for a decade with the IMF's blessing, still exports
more than 25 per cent of its export earnings in debt service payments and
then has to ask for aid to cover its balance of payments deficit.
Tougher conditions
A substantial write-off of Africa's debt now does not mean an end to
conditionality. It requires a new approach, both from African governments
and from the donors. Debt relief must be conditional on the country reaching
an agreed economic reform programme with the IMF. More important, African
governments must be willing to accept much tougher transparency conditions
than the international financial institutions have so far been willing to
demand. At a minimum, governments must publish an annual and externally
audited budget and allow publication of World Bank country reports.
Thenceforth, new aid flows must be conditional on governments meeting the
agreed economic targets and on these good governance requirements. That will
require a much tougher stance from the bank, IMF and the donors. For too
long, they have been willing to tolerate and excuse missed targets or proven
cases of corruption.
Of course, the most important penalty for backsliders will be imposed by the
market. It is the responsibility of African governments to pursue the kind
of policies that encourage the private sector and attract foreign investors,
without whom Africa's recovery will never get under way. If visas, work
permits and expatriate quotas continue to feed an undercurrent of hostility
towards foreign investors, then Africa will remain marginalised.
Only African governments, openly pursuing sensible economic policies, can
revive the region's sick economy. Debt relief is a necessary first step.
Alone, it will solve nothing.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: UN must be more even-handed in
sponsoring peace in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I SAMAKUVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The United Nations Security Council has just imposed, as you reported
('UN imposes sanctions on Angolan rebels', September 17), an arms and oil
embargo on Unita via Resolution 864. Moreover, it has threatened further
sanctions on Unita, covering a trade ban and travel restrictions, if a
ceasefire has not been agreed by November 1. This is a manifestly retrograde
step. It not only serves to delay, even to obstruct, the peace process and
the deployment of humanitarian aid, but poses the question of whether UN
actions are hindering or facilitat-ing a peaceful settle-ment to Angola's
problems.
The UN role in Angola, before, during and after the September elections has
been less than auspicious. The head of the UN mission during the electoral
process, Margaret Anstee, admitted recently that the UN's mandate at the
time was 'woefully inadequate'. A UN report on the elections reinforced her
view by concluding that electoral irregularities were discovered that 'could
have affected the final election result'. In addition, once the process was
derailed, an opportunity for a ceasefire, during the Abijdan talks of
April-May was lost because the UN mission in Angola was told that no 'Blue
Helmets' would be available for six to nine months. It appears that not only
was the UN under-resourced for the task but was also at odds with itself.
The UN secretary-general has recently requested that the security council
allow him more UN staff to help the UN's 'mediation and good offices' but
this has been denied. Instead the security council decided on punitive
sanctions on Unita, combined with a series of deadlines. The UN does not,
however, explain what incentive there is for the MPLA to agree a ceasefire.
If the MPLA knows that a failure to agree a ceasefire will lead to more
sanctions against Unita, clearly it will do all it can to delay agreement.
Unita does believe that the UN has a role to play, but it must be seen to be
even-handed and coherent in its policies, and it must also demonstrate that
it is prepared to commit the necessary resources on the ground to allow a
ceasefire and negotiations to take place. We look forward to seeing evidence
that this is the case.

<TEXT>
Sir, Comments on the damage done to small businesses by the late payment of
invoices have abounded in your columns. As a small company working with
customers of all sizes, we have never experienced such problems; indeed, we
have survived the recession with improved cash flow and no bad debts. Our
secret? Simply a bookkeeper who takes the trouble to ring and ask - very
politely and, if necessary, very regularly - for our money.
Legalised interest charges will be unenforceable for most of us. Talking to
our customers about our money is a cultural inhibition; moaning about it, it
seems, is not.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While Lord Alexander is no doubt informed, many of his UK readers may
not know that German industry usually settles its bills 'X' days, normally
30, after date of invoice.
In the UK, terms of payment are unfortunately normally on the 20th or at the
end of the month following the month of invoice.
The German system allows suppliers to apply sanctions or stop further goods
and services much more promptly when there are payment delays than is
possible under Britain's archaic system.
Another reason why settlement is prompt in Germany is that large companies
have appreciated the importance of their smaller suppliers, some of which
are undercapitalised. Also, companies in Germany are not constantly badgered
by financial analysts, who in the UK calculate asset gearing without regard
to soaring levels of trade creditors.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with some interest and approval the article contributed by Lord
Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, on the subject of late
payment of debts and the basic fairness of an interest entitlement on
overdue amounts (Personal View, September 23).
The British Chambers of Commerce has surveyed its membership and has
concluded that late payment of debts, particularly by large organisations,
including government departments, is a major problem to small and
medium-sized enterprises.
However, I would point out to Lord Alexander that I have on many occasions,
particularly over the past two years, in consultation with clients' bankers,
been told by them in no uncertain terms that existing facilities cannot be
exceeded and the only way to comply is by delaying payments to creditors.
I suggest that, as in so many other instances, the banks may be accused of
speaking with more than one voice. The solution surely is, as Lord Alexander
suggests, to change the law so as to oblige debtors to meet obligations on
time.
Perhaps Lord Alexander's campaign can be joined by other persons of
influence to achieve more order and stability in our trading environment.

FT  28 SEP 93 / To boldly photograph: Earth observation satellites are the
latest growth enterprise in space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rocket is scheduled to take off today from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California. Its 2.8-tonne, Dollars 232m satellite is not going to Mars or
carrying astronauts. Instead, when it gets about 450 miles off the ground -
the moon is 240,000 miles away - it will turn to face the ground and start
taking pictures.
As spending on space - a total Dollars 3.5bn a year by EC countries in the
civil sector alone - slowly levels off, earth observation satellites are
topping the list of priorities at the world's space agencies. Their
applications are practical and immediate: they can help in planning food
production, mineral prospecting, flood damage control, pollution monitoring,
the prediction of volcanic eruptions and weather forecasting.
The growing interest in observation satellites is understandable, as western
governments, wrestling with recession or stubborn budget deficits,
increasingly seek value for money from their space ventures. In addition,
the opportunity to capitalise on the public's concern for the global
environment seems too good to miss.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the US sees earth
observation projects as a way to achieve good public relations after a
series of embarrassing failures. Efforts to explore deep space with the
Hubble space telescope and the Galileo mission to Jupiter have been dogged
by technical hitches, and last month the Dollars 980m Mars Observer was
lost.
The European Space Agency has also experienced setbacks. It has been forced
to delay plans for manned space flights and has bowed to suggestions by
member governments that, when they start, it will make use of cheaper
Russian technology rather than its own more expensive equipment.
With manned flights on the back burner, Esa, funded by western European
governments, has switched its focus to earth observation. In June it
approved funding for a project to build Envisat, so far the biggest earth
observation satellite.
'Earth observation means the arrival of applications that can be used by
governments, rather than just scientists,' says Mr Emilio Lanfranco, the Esa
earth observation director. 'Earth observation now has the highest political
interest.'
This attention translates into big contracts on both sides of the Atlantic.
Today's planned launch - the Landsat 6 satellite made and put into space for
Nasa by the American defence company, Martin Marietta - comes three days
after the launch of a French satellite designed to do a similar job. The
FFr1.5bn Spot 3 lifted off from Esa's launch site in French Guiana, South
America, on Saturday. Built by Matra-Marconi Space, a joint venture between
Matra-Hachette of France and GEC of the UK, Spot 3's tasks include map
making, urban planning, geology, agriculture and forestry. Other Spot
satellites have been used by western military allies for surveillance,
notably during the Gulf war.
The biggest project, Esa's Envisat, has a Dollars 2bn budget. The joint
prime contractors for the 8-tonne satellite are Deutsche Aerospace and
British Aerospace. The UK company's involvement is a reflection of the
British government's championing of earth observation since the late 1980s.
Set for launch in 1998, Envisat will be followed by a regular programme of
further Esa launches. It is part of a global push into the environmental
field in the second half of the decade. Landsat 7, also to be built by
Martin Marietta, is due for launch in 1995.
Japan, whose space agency, Nasda, decided this year to set up its own earth
observation division, also plans an advanced earth observation polar
platform, the Adeos, to be launched in 1996-97. Even newcomers to space such
as Brazil and South Africa are planning their own environmental satellites.
This new emphasis on observation satellites stems partly from their
potential for commercial application: pictures of the earth's surface can be
sold to various agencies, from the US Department of Defence to British
Sugar.
France has set up an agency to sell pictures from the Spot series of
satellites. Spot Image, based in Toulouse, has subsidiaries in the US, Asia
and Australasia. Annual sales have grown from FFr15m (Pounds 1.7m) a year in
1986 to FFr220m in 1992. The US Department of Defence is one customer, but
wants to reduce its reliance on French photographs by installing a camera on
Landsat 7, which can pick out objects 16ft in diameter.
Several companies in Europe and the US already offer satellite photographs
that can be shown on personal computers for a few dollars each. A smattering
of Russian pictures, taken by reconnaissance satellites and detailed enough
to identify objects only 6ft wide, are also trickling on to western markets.
The market for images of the earth's surface could be extensive. British
Sugar, for example, plans to use observation data to predict the size of the
UK sugar beet crop so that it can plan the capacity of its sugar refineries.
The commercial potential of environmental satellites has prompted a US
company, Orbital Sciences, to go it alone next year. It intends to build,
launch and operate its own small satellite which will take pictures of
oceans, picking out sediment, plankton for use in assessing coastal erosion,
and greenhouse gases. Such small satellites can be designed and launched
quickly and cheaply and are calculated to appeal to private sector customers
as well as space agencies.
Despite the rapid development of the sector, problems could lie ahead. Many
satellites are being launched for scientific purposes, but since their
pictures are finding ready commercial customers, the question of how much to
charge different buyers has arisen.
European companies are not well placed to compete with their US
counterparts, says Mr Chris Elliott, an adviser to the European and Japanese
space agencies. American companies have proved themselves winners in
private-sector telecommunications satellites, where California's Hughes
Aircraft has 60 per cent of the market, and in broadcasting, where all seven
direct broadcasting satellites over Europe were built in the US.
While US companies such as Orbital Sciences aim to sell to the private
sector, he adds, European companies are still dependent on giant space
projects such as the Dollars 2bn Envisat.
Although Mr Elliott's views find little public backing in Europe, space
agency officials agree in private that satellite companies could be more
entrepreneurial. But with billion-dollar contracts such as Envisat's up for
grabs, there is not much incentive to change the status quo - particularly
when the satellites may be used for such popular causes as improving the
environment.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Return to the jobs standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to mock promises of full employment. How is the promise to be
kept? The short answer is, of course, by diverting the Treasury's strategic
eye from its proper objective, which is to keep inflation low and preferably
falling. Since the 1970s, when inflation in some OECD countries threatened
to run away with itself, this answer has been a perfect debate-stopper.
The assumption, rarely spoken, always understood, has been that stable
prices are more important than the 'maintenance of a high and stable level
of employment'. With acknowledgements to Mr Gordon Brown, I take the latter
phrase from the wartime coalition government's 1944 white paper on
employment policy. Mr Brown, you will recall, is Labour's shadow chancellor.
We will return to him in a moment, but let us first pursue the argument a
little further.
Whatever brand of economic theory you buy, whatever your fiscal or monetary
stance, whether you are a monetarist or a fine-tuner of demand, a
devaluation freak or a mere exchange rate floater, at the end of the day you
get stable prices by keeping output costs down. This can be done by
increasing productivity, which except in times of rapid growth means sacking
redundant workers. Smarter ways of producing goods or services, or better
machinery, can give more production per head, but without a concomitant rise
in sales you need fewer heads.
In such circumstances those who keep their jobs are likely to settle for
modest increases in pay. You ensure this by putting the fear of unemployment
into the souls of existing and potential employees. In short, if it takes a
certain level of unemployment to loosen up the labour market, so be it. If
the terror of the dole queue is the only weapon that will blast away trade
union dominance, then terror it has to be.
I have eschewed the use of economists' phrases about competitive advantage
and workers pricing themselves out of jobs. A great deal of such jargon is
merely euphemistic. I have been hearing versions of these contemporary
cliches since I was old enough to understand the words supply and demand.
They mean very little to the chap whose pay packet shrinks or disappears.
There is no getting away from the permanent political choice between job
stability and price stability.
It would be wrong, therefore, to castigate Mr Brown for restating Labour's
commitment to full employment, as he did again yesterday at the very start
of his address to the party's conference in Brighton. He thumped out his
list of short-term plans for reducing unemployment with all the passion but
little of the skill of a driven platform orator, hitting the rostrum and
missing the mark. Yet we may forgive him his delivery. Given the choice, how
could a party of the left say other than that unemployment is the number one
priority? The positive elements in Mr Brown's speech should be taken
seriously, as must the pamphlet, published under his name, that accompanied
it. You can get the pamphlet by sending Pounds 1 to Mr Brown at the House of
Commons, London SW1A OAA. Meanwhile we will leave aside crass considerations
of what a promise of jobs for all may do for Labour's standing among the
voters, or its author's chances of making it to leadership of his party. Let
us, rather, join this over-earnest, too-eager-to-please politician in
reasoned discourse.
Mr Brown does not concede that the goal of full employment can only be
pursued at the cost of rising inflation. 'Labour believes in keeping
inflation low, and of course will stick to strict low inflation targets,' he
writes. He is not dodging the issue; merely seeking to persuade us that we
can grow our way out of the need to face the perennial trade-off. He cites
the concept of a non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ('nairu')
as a pet theory that its proponents, the Tories, do not properly understand.
His approach is to go for growth by throwing in most macroeconomic nostrums
except devaluation. He regards the latter as 'inappropriate and
counter-productive'. He repeats his enthusiasm for the education and
training of a highly skilled workforce and takes from the Clinton
professors, Bradford de Long and Lawrence Summers, the view that countries
that invest heavily in equipment reap a harvest of higher rates of growth of
output per head.
His pamphlet has been well received, particularly by those who came to it
prepared for something less closely argued. Whether it makes sense or not is
more a question of instinct than rational deliberation. Everything depends
on whether you believe that a government in which Mr Brown was chancellor
would foster a more rapid rate of growth than Britain has managed for any
appreciable period since the war. Who knows? Perhaps when we have our
highly-trained workforce we can become a new Japan.
Yesterday Mr Brown's was the same message as the one delivered by the party
leader, Mr John Smith, to the Trades Union Congress a few weeks ago.
Non-inflationary growth can be sustained. Not everyone will believe it. In
the run-up to last year's election Mr Smith sought to convince voters that
growth would take care of any gap between Labour's proposed public
expenditure and likely revenue from taxation. The Conservatives turned out
to be more successful spinners of this yarn. In the Tory case it has proved
fanciful; they promised everything and so far have delivered nothing -
except low inflation.
The tide of opinion is turning away from a huge cheer even at that. The
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is now talking about reducing unemployment as
a matter of priority. Naturally he wants sustained growth and low inflation
as well. Don't we all? Mr Clarke is a man who visibly chooses to have his
cake and eat it too. The unemployment theme has recently been echoed at the
IMF, in the OECD, and, with strongest emphasis but perhaps least effect, in
the European Community.
When he was shadow chancellor Mr Smith was not permitted by the then Labour
leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, to preach full employment. It did not sound good in
those hard monetarist times. Phrases like 'the highest possible level of
employment' were used instead. Since he became leader Mr Smith has turned
his party towards its traditional stance of openly aspiring to a full
employment economy. He may catch a tide.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM LYNE

<TEXT>
Sir, In his review of the Nash Ensemble's concert at the Wigmore Hall
('Leipzig cramps the Nash', September 24), David Murray referred to the
Wigmore Hall's 'big, booming Bosendorfer' and stated that the 'Bosendorfer
loomed like a hungry whale'.
The piano used at the concert was in fact a Steinway. I have heard the
Wigmore Bosendorfer produce some wonderful sounds in Chopin and Schubert and
it is ideal for chamber music, but this is typical of the type of prejudice
encountered by this great, traditional piano manufacturer.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dangerous path to advocate for
Yeltsin to safeguard society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JEFF SCHUBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Lloyd and Leyla Boulton ('Iron fist and an iron glove', September
25) refer to the dangers of a dictatorship in Russia, the 'supine nature of
the media' and the apparent fact that it was an insult by Ruslan Khasbulatov
about the drinking habits of the president that was 'crucial' in Yeltsin's
move against the parliament.
They also point out that the regions and republics are taking advantage of
the situation to increase their independence.
I would like to make several points. First, Yeltsin himself actively
encouraged the regions and republics in their separatism by attempting to
use them as a tool against the parliament.
Second, the article suggests that Yeltsin 'must' use both the 'iron first
and the iron glove' - echoing a theme in your editorial the previous day
('Next steps for Mr Yeltsin') that a constitution that gives power to the
president is the 'only basis for stable democratic rule in Russia'. In the
face of the comments about a 'supine' media and the importance of the
relatively trivial (in a healthy democracy at least) Khasbulatov insult,
these are dangerous urgings.
Third, if Yegor Gaider, first deputy prime minister, manages to tighten
macroeconomic conditions significantly before the election, unemployment and
the hardship of many will increase. Moreover, the effects of greater
reliance on market forces will vary between regions and republics,
heightening the separatist desire of some.
What will happen if these (and other) factors produce a new parliament that
is not willing to accept either the Yeltsin version of a new constitution or
the Gaider economic policies? Would you suggest that Yeltsin dissolve it?
What should he do about separatist regions and republics that have seen a
constitution torn up? Crush them?
Your newspaper, western governments and international financial institutions
(which have been 'crucial' in assisting Yeltsin to act decisively) have
chosen a dangerous path in encouraging Yeltsin and his men to believe only
they know how to mould a new society.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: True spirits of the fin de siecle - William Packer
takes a progressive look at the work of the Nabis movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This exhibition of the work of the Nabis continues the Reunion des Musees
Nationaux's fine series, begun more than a decade ago, of major studies of
the great French painters of the later 19th century, this time in
partnership with the Kunsthaus at Zurich. For the first time, however, it is
given not to a single master but to a group or movement that more than any
other, perhaps, represents the true spirit of the 1890s and the fin de
siecle.
It is in the nature of young artists, full of idealistic ambition, to rescue
art from the ever sorry state into which it has fallen, and that the
like-minded should form themselves into a group in order to set it on the
single path of righteousness - of which they alone are sure. It is equally
in the nature of art itself that it should resist such worthy simplicities.
As such artists mature, so inevitably the group falls apart. The Nabis held
together, albeit ever more loosely, for a dozen years, which is unusually
long a time for these things. The natural paradox of this exhibition is that
while it celebrates their commendable community of spirit, its actual
substance is the story of their burgeoning individual talents.
They were all young men, brought together in the summer of 1888 by Paul
Serusier from among his friends associated with the Ecole des Beaux Arts and
the Academie Julian. The founding nucleus consisted of Pierre Bonnard, Henri
Ibels, Paul Ranson and Maurice Denis; Rene Piot, Kerr-Xavier Roussel and
Eduoard Vuillard were brought in from outside, and later on, among others,
Aristide Maillol and Felix Valloton.
The name came a little later. Nabi is the hebrew word for prophet,
enthusiast, seer: and here was this group of young artists in whom, as
Serusier would write in 1889, the state of enthusiasm had become habitual.
They would meet every week, bringing with them an 'ikon' each, a work of to
be put up for general discussion. But their interests were more closely
focused than that might suggest. They were, in Denis' words, devotees of
symbolism, and their importance lies in the link they made in their work,
building on the freer painterliness made available to them by the
impressionists and putting it to the service of a more deeply personal and
metaphysical expression.
Looking back now across a full century, we can see that 'impressionism' for
too long masked other and no less fundamental concurrent influences upon the
course of modernism. Symbolism was one that was at least as important and
enduring, and which, now we choose to recognise it, we may see at once at
work in all of Picasso, in much of fauvism and expressionism, and in all
surrealism. In our own day, the conceptual echoes still reverberate.
The Nabis in their own day knew rather better, and were immediate in
recognising the importance of what Gauguin, Van Gogh and Emile Bernard had
achieved even before 1890, to say nothing of the work of earlier mentors
such as Puvis de Chavannes, Millet, Moreau, and even our own Burne-Jones,
all of whom have been left critically unconsidered until comparatively
recently. Gauguin and his disciples at least gave credit where it was due.
It is a weakness of this exhibition, only marginally corrected in a massive
and splendid catalogue that not everyone will buy, that such antecedents
should not have been made manifest. The rule of this series of exhibitions
has been always to stick to the immediate subject, but with a group rather
than a single artist, especially one that initially was so polemical, the
rule should have been broken.
The omission is all the more odd given the no less reasonable inclusion of
several wood-block prints to illustrate the influence of the Japanese
masters.
Gauguin indeed is the ghost at this feast. Serusier had been with him in
Pont-Aven, considered him an honorary Nabi in any case, and remained in
correspondence with him in the South Seas, regularly urging him to associate
himself with the group. He was simply revered. 'What Manet was for the
generation of 1870', said Denis, 'Gauguin was to that of 1890 . . . He freed
us from all the shackles that the idea of copying brought to our instincts
as painters.'
'How do you see those trees?' Gauguin had asked Serusier. 'They are yellow.
Then paint them yellow; that shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure
ultramarine; those red leaves? make them vermilion.' Serusier's small
Pont-Aven landscape of 1888 is called le Talisman simply because that is
what it became for the Nabis, the true image and touchstone of their
painterly principles. And it is in its very painterliness, rather than any
symbolic intent, that its prescience lies. It is a bridge 20 years into the
future, all the way indeed to the fauves and the expressionists of der
Brucke itself.
For it is in the painterliness of the Nabis that their final dissolution is
foreshadowed: in the love and sensual indulgence in paint almost for its own
sake, and, in the print-making especially, the delicate attention paid to
surface and its formal graphic sophistication. Colour may always carry with
it its own symbolic charge, albeit ambiguous, abstract and unspoken. What we
see in the work of the Nabis as it progresses through the 1890s is openly
symbolic or mystical imagery giving way by degrees to the imagery of the
domestic and the everyday, though always cast at a certain remove in terms
of the decorative and the exquisitely refined.
And how positively these individual talents declare themselves. This is not
the place to dilate upon the greater, familiar talents of such as Bonnard or
Vuillard, but the petits matres are matres still. Valloton and Roussel
especially are as outstanding as they are surprising.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: A Bernstein birthday concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leonard Bernstein, who would have been 75 last August, was much loved by the
London Symphony Orchestra, one of the European musical organisations with
whom he maintained a regular connection almost to the end of his life. The
'Bernstein Anniversary Concert' which the LSO and its chief conductor,
Michael Tilson Thomas, gave at the Barbican Hall on Sunday was a way of
reminding us all, players and audience alike, how much the connection meant
and, nearly three years after his death, how vitally it endures.
It was a touching, convincing and for the most part thoroughly enjoyable
way. The mixture of the most familiar of Bernstein's works (West Side Story
in its concert suite) and those less so (the concert suite from his last
opera, A Quiet Place, and the song-cycle Arias and Barcarolles) was nicely
judged. More confidently and completely (I believe) than any other non-US
orchestra, the LSO has gained mastery over the Bernstein idiom, especially
since Mr Tilson Thomas has been at their helm.
Rhythmic articulation is unfailingly spring-heeled. There is no
faint-hearted holding-back in the utterance. The LSO brass, whose
contributions were all evening a source of roof-raising excitement, showed
this particularly in the 1949 Prelude, Fugue and Riffs, with its cunning
interweave of jazz, both the Big Band variety and the bluesy, and
contrapuntal ingenuity. The danger of their overwhelming the clarinet
soloist (the excellent Andrew Marriner) was avoided by only the narrowest of
margins - and the less-than-ideal Barbican acoustics tend anyway to work
their clotting effect on big, loud climaxes - yet the feeling of dangerously
heady exhilaration was, if anything, thereby increased.
Bernstein's musical language still does not appeal to everyone. Arias and
Barcarolles (1988), most of its eight songs on modestly good-humoured texts
by the composer himself, strikes a vein of rueful tenderness - the theme is
love marital, parental and domestic, freely but sometimes questioningly felt
 -that some critics (particularly British ones) still mistake for
sentimentality.
It was originally written for voices and two pianos. A first orchestration
for strings and percussion (1989, by Bernstein and Bright Sheng) had the
effect of enlarging the canvas, not to entirely positive end. On this
occasion a new scoring (by Bruce Coughlin) for full orchestra was given its
first outing: the enlargement process is taken still further, and every
ounce of the soloists' artistry was required to sustain intimate contact
with the audience.
As these were Frederica von Stade and Thomas Hampson, singers with beautiful
voices capable of displaying kaleidoscopic shades of colour and verbal
nuance, contact was indeed sustained. But I hope their success in doing so,
comprehensive and delightful at it was, will mislead no-one into considering
the original, piano version of Arias and Barcarolles now superseded: it
remains infinitely truer to the spirit of the work.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Phelim McDermott's Goldoni - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director/adaptor/performer Phelim McDermott is a fascinating oddball.
Onstage, his physical talent is so eccentric and memorable that you remember
him more as a mime than as an actor: witness his Quixotic-fantastico account
of Matamore in Richard Jones's The Illusion (Old Vic, 1990). Yet he has rare
vocal gifts too - his cleft-palate effects as Camille in the Nottingham
Playhouse's 1991 Flea in her Ear haunt me - and he thinks sufficiently in
purely sonic terms to have co-devised Radio 4's recent Masterson
Inheritance. As that series showed, he is one of Britain's leading priests
of comic improvisation.
Another recent branch of his career has been directing plays. In visual
terms, his Nottingham Dr Faustus last year had all the bizarre fantasy that
has marked McDermott's own performances, but was weak in projecting
Marlowe's poetic drama. How smart of Leeds's West Yorkshire Playhouse (which
has a fine record for comedy) to have him direct a Goldoni play. Without a
vivid sense of fantasy, Goldoni's plays can fizzle away into trite formula.
With it, they can be inspired. McDermott's account of The Servant of Two
Masters has some corny patches, but in essence it manages to be crazy,
humane, bizarre, sweet, imaginative, all at the same time.
In few plays are plot and sub-plot more tightly coupled than here. Indeed,
which is the sub-plot? You hardly know. Beatrice, disguised as her dead
brother Federigo, is looking for her lover Florindo. Clarice, who had been
betrothed to Federigo though she had never met him, is horrified to find
that 'Federigo' (Beatrice) has come back to life (and to marry her;
horrified because she is in love with her new fiance, Silvio. Meanwhile,
'Federigo''s new servant Truffaldino is so under-fed that he also takes up
employment with Florindo. For a long while, Florindo and Beatrice never
meet; while Truffaldino's efforts to serve them both are the material of
perfect farce - climaxing when he has to serve them both lunch, in different
rooms, at the same time.
The setting is Venice; and McDermott's designer, Julian Crouch, has
constructed a wonderful cartoon little Venice onstage, with five or more
black-and-white architectural layers packed close together, creating
interiors and exteriors, upper and lower levels. The action occurs in a
single day: delectably and simply shown by a portable yellow sun, which is
moved from dawn to dusk in a huge arc. (In the twilight finale, the sun-disc
is simply turned around, to become a moon.) Music is sparingly supplied by
Geraldine Connor, mainly sung wordlessly by the cast and during
scene-changes, in the vein of Alessandro Swingle Scarlatti.
Toby Jones plays the title role, very engagingly, like Just William - a
schoolboy in shorts, specs and cap who tries to steer the grown-ups' lives
to suit his own. This brilliantly novel, touching, and huggable
interpretation makes fresh sense of the old Harlequin role (and he wields
his specs like Eric Morecambe). McDermott has used improvisation to build up
certain comedy scenes here - but it is Jones who best understands the
spontaneity that must run through Goldoni. When, in the middle of
negotiating one giddy imbroglio, he turns to us and says 'I'm making this up
as I go along,' we believe him - and yet that line turns out to be in the
script.
McDermott's other most bliss-inducing comic interpreters are three deadpan
servants (John Axon, David Bliss, Malcolm Ridley) who scarcely speak a word.
They provide sound effects, act as porters, try to support Truffaldino in
the great waiting-at-two-different-tables scene, and heighten the comedy's
whole sense of precariousness. Elsewhere, however, too much dialogue is
laboured out front as if the audience was Very Stupid. Robert Kingswell's
Pantalone and John Muirhead's Doctor are the most effortful and unfunny.
Crouch's designs have a few minor errors of taste: eg Beatrice's cone-shaped
wig of straw. But Toby Sedgwick (Florindo), William Waghorn (Silvio),
Catherine Kanter (her professional debut - Clarice) and Isobel Middleton
(Beatrice), keep up the mix of humanity and absurdity that is the breath of
life to Goldoni and McDermott alike.
At the Quarry Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until October 16

Icelanders used to be addicted to killing girl babies and were extremely
reluctant to give up the practice on converting to Christianity. In India,
it seems that not only has there always been female infanticide but it is
now hugely on the increase, according to Assignment; Live and Let Die (BBC
2; 7.45).
Ultrasound has been a boon for Indian families, because now they can abort
female foetuses - a decision some parents justify on moral grounds, so
wretched is the quality of life an unwanted female can expect. But as well
as abortion, murder continues to be practised on a wide scale (if you accept
that distinction).
It is a natural transition to the sufferings of Chinese women in Omnibus:
Wild Swans (BBC 1, 10.30). This is the film of Jung Chang's best seller, a
poignant account of the experiences of three generations of the women in her
family.
Tonight's light-hearted moments come with Armistead Maupin's Tales of the
City (C4, 9.00), another writer with a talent for transporting us to an
exotic society, San Francisco in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
Freshfields, the City of London solicitors, has been indulging in a bit of
vanity publishing to trumpet its 250th anniversary. The first Freshfield,
James William, did not arrive on the scene until 1801, but the firm
maintains that it can trace its roots back to 1743, when one Samuel Dodd was
appointed solicitor to the Bank of England.
In 1808 the first partnership bearing the name Freshfield was set up. When
Benjamin Disraeli joined Swain, Stevens, Maples Pearse &amp; Hunt in 1821, it
was, he said, 'the most eminent solicitors' firm in the City except
Freshfield's'. The list of eminent and blue-chip clients has included:
Castlereagh, Sir Robert Peel, Gladstone, Bank of England, Lloyd's, London
Chatham &amp; Dover Railway Co, J Henry Schroder, P&amp;O, Gulbenkian, the Kuwait
government and Pearson, owners of the Financial Times.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Fee of Dollars 4,000 an hour 'not
unreasonable' - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who said Britain's top commercial lawyers were the most expensive in the
world by charging an average of Dollars 585 an hour? The Delaware Chancery
Court has just approved a New York lawyer's fee in a 1991 shareholder action
which amounts to more than Dollars 4,000 an hour.
According to America's National Law Journal, the judge who approved Mr
Arthur Abbey's Dollars 8.5m contingency fee, Vice-Chancellor Carolyn Berger,
said Mr Abbey should not be penalised for achieving an easy victory. The
judge said the fee, which amounted to just over 16 per cent of the sum
recovered for the shareholders, was 'generous but not unreasonable'. The
decision appears to run counter to a 1980 ruling by the Delaware Supreme
Court, which said a fee amounting to Dollars 437 an hour was the highest it
could approve.

<TEXT>
The Institute of Management, which claims to be Europe's largest management
body, has chosen James Watson (above) as its new chairman. He succeeds Sir
Derek Hornby, who presided over the amalgamation last year of the British
Institute of Management and the Institute of Industrial Managers.
James Watson, chairman of NFC, has long been a member of the IM, and firmly
believes that improving the quality of management is the key to future
prosperity. He sees his main function as chairman of the IM to help ensure
that 'high standards of management education are available to managers'.
Watson is likely to be more 'hands on' than some previous chairmen. Unlike
many of the big names that have preceded him, (Sir Brian Wolfson, Sir Peter
Parker, and Sir Bob Reid have been among more high-profile past chairmen)
James Watson does not have his fingers in many other pies. He holds no other
non-executive positions, and plans to devote about a day a week to the IM.
Watson is a trained accountant who has been at NFC since 1977, where he has
been finance director and deputy chairman. With 30,000 employees, he says he
has insight into what it takes to manage well. 'I believe I'm a good
manager. I wouldn't be doing it otherwise,' he says.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: For richer, for poorer - Two cases of
great significance to family borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week the House of Lords is expected to give judgment in two related
cases which could change the face of bank lending practice.
Barclays Bank v O'Brien and CIBC Mortgages v Pitt will decide whether wives
who act as surety for their husbands' borrowings should be treated as
members of a specially protected class to whom banks owe a duty of care.
Whichever way the decisions go, they will have significant implications for
borrowers and lenders.
In the O'Brien case, Barclays is challenging the Court of Appeal's rejection
of its claim for repossession of the home of Mrs Bridget O'Brien, a mother
of six, who signed documents for a second mortgage on the matrimonial home
as security for her husband's business debts.
The extent of the guarantee liability was Pounds 135,000, although Mr
O'Brien had told his wife it was only Pounds 60,000. Mrs O'Brien signed the
charge without reading it. When his business overdraft exceeded Pounds
154,000, the bank sought foreclosure.
The order for possession was upheld by a county court judge but overturned
by the Appeal Court. The court said wives who provide security for their
husbands' debts belong to a special protected class, in which equity would
hold the security given by the surety to be unenforceable where the surety
had not adequately understood the nature and effect of the transaction and
her consent to the transaction was not a true and informed one.
The court said that, on the facts, Mrs O'Brien had not understood the
transaction. The bank had instructed the sub-branch manager to have the
transaction and extent of the guarantee liability explained to her, but this
had not happened.
The court also said that, because of her husband's misrepresentation, she
had not appreciated that the charge was for more than Pounds 60,000.
Consequently the charge was enforceable only to that amount. Barclays
appealed to the Lords.
The CIBC case is similar but different in one respect - Mr and Mrs Pitt were
joint borrowers. The matrimonial home was jointly owned. Mr Pitt, who was
dominating both domestically and financially, told his wife he wanted to
borrow some money against the house to buy shares on the stock market.
He arranged a remortgage with CIBC for Pounds 150,000 on the basis that it
was for a second home. Mrs Pitt signed the application without reading it.
Later she signed the charge without reading it and any idea of the amount
being borrowed.
Mr Pitt invested the money in the stock market and, at one point, was a
paper millionaire. But he lost everything in the October 1987 market crash.
When CIBC began mortgage repossession proceedings, Mrs Pitt claimed she had
signed the charge by reason of her husband's undue influence and that, as
CIBC had not made her aware of what she was signing, the charge was
unenforceable.
Mrs Pitt has lost at every stage of her action. In the Appeal Court the
judges said no liability could attach to CIBC as it had been a bona fide
purchaser for value without notice. As far as CIBC was concerned, it was a
perfectly normal remortgage by joint borrowers for joint purposes. There was
nothing in the transaction to put them on notice.
The court also overturned an earlier finding of undue influence, because it
said the transaction had not been 'manifestly disadvantageous' to her as
required in law. Mrs Pitt appealed to the Lords.
Barclays' lawyer, Mr Anthony Pugh-Thomas, a partner of City solicitors
Lovell White Durrant, says a great deal is riding on the outcome. The Court
of Appeal appears to have decided wives should be placed in a special
category regardless of whether or not they were subjected to undue
influence, he says.
If the Law Lords uphold that decision, it would oblige banks and other
lenders always to insist that wives are separately advised. It could also
open the floodgates to claims by thousands of wives who, although not
subject to undue influence, signed charges without receiving separate
advice.
Mr Pugh-Thomas points out that borrowing for small businesses could also be
badly affected, as a great many loans to small businesses are secured
against the matrimonial home. The risk to the banks if the case goes against
Barclays has not been quantified. Barclays has done its own internal
calculations of the level of borrowings at risk, but says it is hard to put
a precise figure on it. If there is a rush of claims by borrowers attempting
to escape their obligations, it says, each case would be fought hard on its
facts.
But could Barclays accept a situation where each party has to be separately
advised? Mr Pugh-Thomas says it could, because it is already regarded as
good banking practice with husbands and wives. The British Bankers'
Association code says banks should advise individuals asked to guarantee a
loan for someone else to seek independent advice. Those safeguards may now
have to be tightened.
From a legal point of view, Mr Pugh-Thomas says the real difficulty for
banks will be knowing who is entitled to this special protection. The
crucial issue is how far the class extends.
CIBC's lawyer, Mr Paul Brimelow, a partner of Manchester solicitors Fox
Brooks Marshall, agrees. If the Law Lords rule that the special class
afforded protection extends as far as Mrs Pitt, it will mean effectively
that the mere relationship of husband and wife will be enough to raise a
presumption invalidating the transaction. It will oblige lenders to ensure
that, even where a couple take on a liability in their joint names, the wife
not only understands the transaction but also, possibly, that she obtains
independent financial advice.
The implications of such a decision are horrendous, he says. It could mean
that every time a couple arranges a building society mortgage, the woman
will be required to seek separate financial advice. That could double the
cost of conveyancing and could put back recovery in the housing market.
The number of mortgage repossessions is down from its height in 1991, but
there is still a large amount of mortgage arrears. If Mrs Pitt wins, there
is a danger couples will see it as a convenient way to escape mortgage
debts.
Mr Brimelow hopes this would not be the response, but his firm has received
a steady flow of inquiries about the case, which is an indication of the
head of steam building up. Mrs O'Brien's solicitor, Mr Brian Hadcroft of
Talbots in Birmingham, confirms he has been contacted by more than 40 firms
of solicitors handling similar cases.
Mr Brimelow says there is a positive side to the case, however, in that it
gives the Law Lords the opportunity to reconsider the law on undue
influence. Following National Westminster Bank v Morgan, for a transaction
to be set aside for undue influence the plaintiff has to show that it was
'manifestly disadvantageous'.
He thinks Pitt will become the leading case on undue influence. The Law
Lords may be considering abandoning the requirement for manifest
disadvantage, he says. This would mean protection for the old lady who was
forced to sell her home against her wishes, even if she suffered no clear
disadvantage as she got its full market value.
The O'Brien case is thought to be evenly balanced. But Mr Brimelow believes
Mrs Pitt ought not to win. Whatever the outcome, the two cases together will
lay down the criteria banks will have to follow when lending in the future.

FT  28 SEP 93 / People: Brian Garraway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Garraway, formerly deputy chairman of BAT Industries, and recently
chairman of printing company BPCC and a non-executive director of the Burton
retailing group, died yesterday from a heart attack. He was 61.
Described by a friend as 'extremely bright, with a really sharp financial
brain', Garraway was born in Birmingham in 1931 and educated at King
Edward's School, Birmingham. He qualified as an accountant and joined BAT in
1955 as a travelling auditor. His job took him all over the world, and
furnished him with a fund of anecdotes which he would tell later 'with a
twinkling eye and a great sense of humour'.
Sir John Hoskyns, Burton's chairman, said yesterday that Garraway was a
'remarkable man. He was a very powerful personality with a very good mind;
absolutely fearless in all senses - both physically and mentally; and the
most tremendous asset to any board.'
During his time at BAT he did much to raise the group's profile in the City,
where he was a popular and respected figure, and was closely involved with
the group's move into financial services through the acquisition of Eagle
Star and Allied Dunbar.
He was a member of the main board at BAT from June 1979, and served as a
director of BATUS, the US retailing business, of BAT stores, of Eagle Star
and of Allied Dunbar. He joined the board of Farmers in 1989.
On his retirement from BAT in October 1992 Garraway was deputy chairman of
BAT Industries, chairman of Allied Dunbar, a director of Farmers, chairman
of BAT financial services, and executive chairman of Eagle Star Holdings.
He became a non-executive director of Burton in October 1991, and was
appointed first chairman of a new regulatory board at Lloyd's of London a
year later.
As chairman of BPCC he was the inspiration behind the company's proposed
flotation.
He leaves a widow, Jean, three daughters and a son.

European Court

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
No judgments have been delivered by the Community Courts since they returned
to work after the summer vacation on 13 September 1993. The first is
expected on 7 October. But there have been oral hearings in 12 cases.
Last week, there was a hearing in a case which may prove an important test
of the Court's interpretation of the legal principles underlying the
internal market.
The case concerns lotteries and the rights of agents representing
large-scale lotteries run by German Lander to provide their services in the
UK and to import advertising materials and tickets into the country.
Unlike certain small or private lotteries, large-scale lotteries are not
expressly permitted by the UK Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976. Importing
tickets and advertising materials relating to large-scale lotteries is also
prohibited.
According to the summary of the interested parties' arguments prepared by
French judge, M. Grevisse, the Commission drew attention to its recent
report on the EC gambling market.
The report (Gambling in the Single Market - Study of the current legal and
market situation) estimated the value of the EC gambling market, measured by
total stakes, at ECU 46.5bn (Dollars 36bn) in 1989. Lotteries and similar
activities accounted for ECU 16.7bn. National lottery markets were dominated
by state organised and controlled lotteries, except in the UK. Yet
international gambling operators, by using new technologies, are pushing the
frontiers of gambling beyond national borders.
However, the legal questions raised by this case make it likely that the
Court's ruling will be indicative of its approach to the internal market.
The key questions concern the permissible exceptions to the rules on free
movement of goods and services in the internal market, both trade
restrictions expressly exempted by the Treaty and those recognised by the
Court's past decisions as justified in the public interest.
The first question is whether the rules on trade in goods or those on
cross-border services apply. Whatever the answer, similar principles have
been applied in the past to permissible exceptions.
Eleven member countries have urged the Court to give a restrictive
interpretation of the Treaty rules on free movement of goods and services in
answer to questions referred by the London Commercial Court in proceedings
brought by the Customs and Excise. Italy has not commented.
On the other hand, the Commission told the ECJ positive answers must be
given to questions concerning the equivalence of the safeguards enforced
under German law with those applied in the general field of lotteries,
football pools and bingo in the UK.
The Commission added there is no justification for UK rules to be allowed to
go beyond those already applied to the lotteries in question by way of 'home
country control' in Germany.
If the ECJ agrees with the Commission, the UK rules will be unlawful. It
remains to be seen whether the Court will interpret the Treaty in a manner
which will promote rather than delay a genuine single market for business.
C-275/92, HM Customs &amp; Excise v Schindler, hearing ECJ FC, 22 September
1993.
Pending cases.
Recently, the Court has heard argument in cases varying from interpretation
of the 1975 directive on waste disposal (C-236/92 Comitato di Coordinamento
per la Difesa della Cava et al v Regione Lombardia et al, hearing ECJ FC, 14
September 1993) to consideration of the application of the Treaty rules on
free movement of goods to national restrictions on the advertising of
non-pharmaceutical products by pharmacists (C-292/92 Hunermund v
Landesapothekerkammer Baden-Wurttemberg, hearing ECJ FC, 15 September 1993).
In the competition field, the Court of First Instance (CFI) heard an appeal
by Cartes Bancaire against the Commission's 1991 decision imposing a fine on
the Eurocheque network's Helsinki agreement on charges relating to
Eurocheques (Joined Cases T-39/92 and T40/92, Cartes Bancaires 'CB' v
Commission, hearing CFI 1CH, 22 September 1993).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forsaking a career in Whitehall that looked likely to take him to the top
post in a government department is Edward Osmotherly, who becomes one of the
three local government ombudsmen on November 1.
Osmotherly, 51, is currently deputy secretary at the Department of
Transport, where he is Principal Establishment and Finance Officer. Before
that, he was in charge of the department's public transport and research
activities, including responsibility for British Rail and London Transport.
He achieved temporary notoriety in 1990, when a memorandum warning of the
dangers of wholesale privatisation of BR found its ways into the hands of
the opposition.
After leaving Cambridge, Osmotherly joined the civil service in 1963 in the
ministry of housing and local government. He had several periods dealing
with local authorities, notably preparations for the local government
reorganisation in 1974. In 1972-73 he was a Harkness Fellow, studying
federal, state and local government relations in the US.
Osmotherly was seconded to British Rail in 1979, before becoming head of
machinery of government in the old Civil Service department between 1980 and
1982. There he promulgated the rules for civil servants appearing in front
of parliamentary select committees which have born his name since. He went
to the Transport department in 1982 as under secretary.
For Osmotherly, the ombudsman post offers the chance to do a 'thoroughly
valuable job' helping ordinary people find their way through the labyrinth
of local administration to get justice. He succeeds Frederick Laws, and will
be responsible for local authorities in the South West and West of England,
the West Midlands, East Anglia and parts of Southern and Central England.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Angels come to the rescue
 -A growing breed of private investors to rival the venture capitalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Iain Johnston joined GB Mailing, a young software company, its founders
had already tried, unsuccessfully, to raise venture capital finance. But
most of the venture capitalists approached did not understand the technology
while the one which did thought the project was too risky. It also wanted
too large a stake in the business.
'We needed a small amount of funding to get our marketing off the ground,'
says Johnston, who is now managing director. Johnston, who had been working
as a management consultant up until the time he joined GB, turned to his
former boss, Robin Davies, for help. Davies put up Pounds 50,000 for a 5 per
cent stake.
Davies, who still heads his own consultancy, says he backed Johnston and GB
Mailing for a mixture of emotional and commercial reasons. 'It was not a
classic City-style analysis,' he says. 'I had an absolute belief that Iain
Johnston could make it succeed and the two other directors were believable
and likable people.'
GB, which sells mail sorting and marketing software, has justified his
faith. It has grown rapidly in the past three years, employs nearly 40
people and expects turnover this year to reach Pounds 2m. Davies is on the
point of exercising an option to double his holding.
Davies says this is the first time he has made an investment of this kind -
he is a non-executive director and has no day-to-day involvement. But he is
one of a growing breed of private investors or 'business angels' which has
emerged in recent years.
The typical angel has a business background. Many have made money by selling
their own business, though most are comfortably off rather than fabulously
wealthy, according to research by Colin Mason of Southampton University and
Richard Harrison of Ulster University.
Angels are more willing to invest on a hunch than the professional venture
capitalist and they are often motivated by a desire to get involved,
part-time or full-time, in the running of the business. They are also
prepared to invest relatively small amounts and to be patient investors at a
time when professional venture capitalists are concentrating on the bigger
deals and are becoming increasingly short-term.
Signs that the economy is beginning to recover have given an added urgency
to the role of angels. There are concerns that the banks will be more
cautious about backing small businesses while the demise in December of the
Business Expansion Scheme, which gives tax breaks to equity investors, will
narrow the funding options open to small firms.
Angels have been recognised for some time as providing an alternative to the
formal venture capital industry but have proved difficult to organise into a
coherent force. Linc, a 'marriage bureau' run by a group of enterprise
agencies, and Venture Capital Report, a newsletter which attempts to bring
together entrepreneurs and investors, have had only limited success. Unlike
the professional venture capitalists, business angels cannot be found in a
business directory.
'Believing in angels is like believing in motherhood - it is self-evidently
a good thing,' comments Lucius Cary, founder of Venture Capital Report
(VCR). 'There does not appear to be a downside until you go into it more
deeply. Then you find there is a large number of angels who cannot find
deals but who, at the same time, are unwilling to subscribe to VCR or one of
the other networks. There have been many initiatives over the years but most
have failed.'
After many false starts, Cary and others involved in backing entrepreneurs
believe that a turning point may now have been reached.
The key is a government-backed scheme to set up pilot marriage bureaux in
five areas of the country. The government gave Pounds 40,000 each for a
two-year experiment to five Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in
Bedfordshire, Calderdale and Kirklees, Devon and Cornwall, East Lancashire
and South and East Cheshire. All five TECs have been asked to bid for a
further year's worth of funding.
The two most successful appear to be the Cheshire and Devon and Cornwall
TECs. The Cheshire programme, known as Techinvest, has brokered six deals
worth Pounds 500,000 since it was launched last February. More than 50
investors with about Pounds 1.5m of available capital have been signed up,
says Vivienne Upcott Gill, Techinvest manager.
Crucially, Techinvest has not only found investors in Cheshire. It has also
attracted angels from outside the region by establishing contacts with Linc
and Venture Capital Report. It believes that this combination of a local
exposure with links into a national network is a key to its success.
Upcott Gill, who had previous experience of investor networks from working
for Cheshire County Council, says a big factor in Techinvest's success is
the work it puts into advising the entrepreneurs on how to present their
proposals and into training sessions for investors on subjects such as
structuring deals and forming syndicates.
Equally important is the work which the angel networks put into selecting
the good propositions for investors and filtering out the 'duds'. Venture
Capital Report, which was founded in 1978 and which now has just over 450
subscribers, provides brief but very thorough descriptions of the business
proposals that it features.
Colin Mason, who has carried out a review of the five pilots, says the more
successful ones share three characteristics. They are based in areas with a
strong regional identity, a reasonable number of wealthy residents and an
entrepreneurial culture; they are run by people with a missionary zeal; and
they have sufficient funding.
'They must have the resources to carry out a continuous promotion campaign
because there will be a constant turnover of business propositions and, to a
lesser extent, investors,' says Mason. Upcott Gill calculates that
Techinvest would need an annual budget of Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000 to
perform effectively. 'These schemes need substantial long-term funding,' she
says. 'If they were commercially viable, accountants would be doing it.'
Some accountants do maintain lists of wealthy private clients who might be
prepared to back a business. Blackstone Franks, a London firm, has about 600
clients on its 'private investors list' with no less than Pounds 250m
available to invest. 'That is more than many venture capital companies,'
comments Richard Coon, the partner in charge.
But Coon estimates that few deals have been done in the two years that the
firm has kept this list. 'It is not our primary activity and matching
investors with business proposals is horrendously difficult.'
The growing realisation of the potential of angels - Mason estimates they
may have between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn available for investment
(compared with the Pounds 1.4bn invested by the venture capital industry
last year) - has prompted others to take an interest.
In the UK, National Westminster Bank is researching the possibility of
creating a nationwide register of business angels. Meanwhile, a former
banker, Nigel Lacy, has launched the Capital Exchange, a network of advisers
who will carry out a basic vetting of proposals for publication in a
bi-monthly magazine, the Capital Exchange Gazette.
But the difficulties that relative amateurs encounter in making investments
should not be underestimated. One hopeful angel who began backing small
companies after a lifetime spent making stock market investments for a large
City institution found it a less than rewarding experience.
'I invested in five or six companies but my timing was wrong and virtually
every one had to be written down,' he says. 'It became too demanding and I
wanted more leisure time. This is something that the country needs but it is
a great deal more difficult than it sounds.'

thumbs down - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consultants still have a poor image with small business owners despite
schemes such as the government's Enterprise Initiative which attempts to
break down barriers.
A poll* of small firms employing between six and 50 people in and around
Milton Keynes found that most were sceptical of external consultants. They
saw consultants as 'far too expensive', 'not offering practical advice in
layman's terms,' and 'not living in the real world'.
The areas where business owners had most frequently sought help were quality
(44 per cent), sales and marketing (22 per cent), staff and management
development (16 per cent), finance and administration and information
technology (both 13 per cent).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses seeking contacts in Spain may benefit from Enterprise Galicia
'93, a European Commission- sponsored initiative to present this region of
north-west Spain to the European business community.
Participants will have the opportunity to meet representatives of up to 300
Galician businesses at the two-day event on October 21 and 22 in Santiago de
Compostela. Thirty-minute 'match-making' meetings can be arranged in
advance.
The association of British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) plans to lead to a UK

FT  28 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): New small firms minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has a new small firms minister following a minor reshuffle triggered
by the resignation of the government chief whip. Lord Strathclyde, formerly
a junior minister at the Department of the Environment, this week changes
places with Baroness Denton, small firms minister for the past 17 months.
Lord Strathclyde, who is 33, began his parliamentary career as a government
whip in 1988 and has since had spells as junior minister in the Department
of Employment and Scottish Office as well as environment. Before embarking
on a political career he worked as an insurance broker.
Small firms organisations said they were puzzled by the decision to swap
ministers. Opinions about Baroness Denton were divided but she was highly
regarded for her practical approach to small business problems and her
willingness to address issues such as the banks' treatment of small firms.
Unusually for a small firms minister she had a business background.
Lobbyists have grown used to a rapid turnover of small business ministers.
Lord Strathclyde is the 14th since a small business division was created
within the Department of Trade and Industry in November 1971. Nicholas
Ridley was the first minister with responsibility for this area but David
Trippier, who held the title from 1983 to 1987, did most to popularise the
role.
Ideally the minister would be in the Commons rather than the Lords and would
not have to divide his time between small business issues and consumer
affairs, small firms groups said.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Technology: Silence is golden - Electronic discussions can
take the cost, disunity and lost time out of meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The meeting seems to be endless and you are seething with frustration.
Others are dominating the discussion and you cannot wait to leave, even
though you have ideas which you would like to contribute.
Unfortunately, the problem is a familiar one at companies and organisations
the world over. All too often, it means that meetings last longer than
necessary, are inconclusive, and fail to extract the best from everyone
attending.
This is not only annoying, it also costs money. In the US, some 11m meetings
a day, adding up to 3bn a year, take place in business and government,
according to the Meeting Management Institute of 3M Corporation.
Meetings can swallow between 7 and 15 per cent of the personnel budget.
The proportion of time that US managers spend in meetings can vary between
30 and 80 per cent. The institute cites one Fortune 500 company that wasted
Dollars 71m (Pounds 46.1m) a year on 'bad meetings'.
But while many people know what 'bad meetings' are - some might apply the
description to all meetings - deciding how to make them enjoyable and
productive is tricky.
Technology cannot replace human brain power, individual eloquence and
interaction between people.
Yet with the intelligent use of software, meetings can be made more
interesting, worthwhile, and even - a new concept for those with an
antipathy to meetings - fun. 'We want to eliminate the need for face-to-face
meetings, if possible, or make them more productive,' says Jay Nunamaker,
chairman of Ventana, a US company specialising in meetings software, part of
the computerised information-sharing process known as groupware.
Nunamaker, also professor of computer science at the University of Arizona,
believes 'the way we meet is going to change'. As companies come under
increasing pressure to develop products and services more rapidly to compete
with rivals, more streamlined meetings to save time and money will be
required.
Experience with Ventana's product, GroupSystems, has shown that its use can
enable some team projects to be completed in half the time taken in
traditional meetings - a 90 per cent cut has been achieved in some cases.
Typical applications include programmes geared towards business process
re-engineering, quality improvement and personnel management.
The way that GroupSystems works appears simple, though the software is
complex. Those at the meeting - usually brought together in one room,
although not necessarily - type their ideas on to a computer screen in front
of them as fast as they can. They can react to other peoples' ideas as they
appear and ask questions about these. Because of the anonymity conferred by
the computer, no one need feel inhibited about expressing their views,
however unpalatable these may be to top management.
Usually, such meetings are led by facilitators who understand how the
software works and can best be used. They can take the participants through
stages ranging from initial brainstorming, through sorting topic categories
and priorities, to evaluation and a final vote, if necessary. Since everyone
can contribute views whenever they like, far more information can be
generated than in normal meetings.
Usually, if 15 people meet for an hour, each person has only four minutes on
average to say anything. But, says Nunamaker: 'We know that about 20 per
cent of people speak 80 per cent of the time.' In electronic meetings,
participation is almost total.
There are other benefits, too. 'We have run sessions with people who refuse
to be in conventional meetings with each other,' says Nunamaker.
Software-driven meetings are also more likely to produce a result.
'Sometimes, people hold meetings to avoid making decisions, sometimes to
socialise.' With methods like GroupSystems or the rival VisionQuest package
developed by Texas-based Collaborative Technologies, this can be avoided.
The use of electronic meeting systems gives participants access to databases
within their own organisations. This can save time when a key piece of
information is suddenly needed to help along a particular discussion. In
addition, a full record of the meeting is readily available.
Among US users of GroupSystems are IBM, AT&amp;T, the US Army - all of which
helped finance its development - Boeing, the US Department of Defence, and
the Federal Aviation Administration. Another is Hewlett Packard, whose
information technology manager, Hudi Cantrell, says the technique has led to
a 'radical improvement' in the conduct of meetings. Speed and documentation
are important benefits, but more so is the all-inclusive nature of the
information that results from assertive and reserved participants.
'The richness of information that results is phenomenally effective,' says
Cantrell. Users of the GroupSystems facility at Hewlett Packard say they can
accomplish tasks in half the usual time. Tom McMillen, director of
information technology at Greyhound Financial Corporation, is also
enthusiastic. 'It helps people become less focused just on their own ideas
and more focused on those of others.' He reckons it has saved the company
considerable time in its strategic planning process.
GroupSystems is in use at 360 sites in the US, Denmark, Britain, Germany,
Finland, France, Russia, Bulgaria, Hungary and elsewhere. Nunamaker says
another benefit is that meetings can be much larger than previously. 'It can
be as many as 70 people - this works very well.'
Not all managers are easily convinced of the wisdom of running meetings by
software. They have to be prepared for some tough or even unpleasant
statements on the screen.
'Anonymity helps separate ideas from the politics behind them,' says
Nunamaker. 'Ideas can be weighed on their merits rather than on their
source.'
It can come as a shock for many bosses to find that people may have totally
different, and possibly more accurate, views than their own. One US general
used to bang on his computer terminal with a coffee cup while demanding to
be told who made critical statements.
Anonymity may help in the airing of valuable views but it can also cause
nasty bruises to overdeveloped egos.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Technology: Strides in sugar science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emerging science of glycobiology - the study of carbohydrates - takes an
important step forward this week, with the launch of an instrument to
determine the sequence of the sugar molecules that are attached to most
proteins in the human body.
The RAAM GlycoSequencer, developed by Oxford GlycoSystems (OGS) in the UK,
enables biomedical researchers to calculate an unknown sugar sequence within
a few hours - a job that would previously have taken months of painstaking
laboratory work. Its significance may match that of the automatic sequencers
of proteins and nucleic acids (genes) which made possible the rapid
development of biotechnology in 1980s.
Proteins in living cells are linked to complex branched chains of sugar
molecules, known as oligosaccharides, which control their biological
function. For example the clot-busting protein TPA is in fact a series of
glycoproteins which dissolve blood clots at different speeds, depending on
their sugar chains.
The RAAM sequencer breaks down an oligosaccharide into its constituent units
with an array of sugar-splitting enzymes. It then uses software with
artificial intelligence to reconstruct the chains. The instrument and
equipment cost Pounds 100,000.
OGS, founded in 1988, was Oxford University's first spin-off company; its
technology originally came from the university's Glycobiology Institute
headed by Raymond Dwek.
Since then the company has raised Pounds 20m in private financing, though
the university still holds a 5 per cent equity stake.
The corporate strategy is to increase income as quickly as possible by
selling biochemical reagents and instruments for glycobiology research;
sales were Pounds 1.6m in 1992 and are doubling annually.
At the same time OGS is collaborating with pharmaceutical groups such as
SmithKline Beecham to develop drugs for diseases including arthritis and
cancer. If conditions permit, OGS will raise more funds through a stock
market floatation next year.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Technology: Research stuck in the pork barrel - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH SHAPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 16th century England, farmers identified their pigs by their earmarks.
Likewise, US federally funded research has for some years had small portions
of funds 'earmarked' by powerful members of Congress to go directly to
institutions in their districts.
Now, a critical report by George E. Brown, democratic chairman of the House
committee on science, space and technology, has revealed that the amounts of
earmarked funds have leapt upwards to the point that they 'eat into the base
programmes' that the nation relies on 'to fund our scientific enterprise'.
Brown has been a lonely critic of the practice, which his fellow members
prefer not to talk about. Now, he reveals that in the fiscal year 1992,
Dollars 708m (Pounds 460m) of the Dollars 72bn spent on research was
earmarked, almost double the amount the year before. In 1980 only seven
awards were earmarked, totalling Dollars 10m.
Since then, while some universities decry earmarking, a growing number of
institutions have accepted it or even pay high-priced lobbyists to win large
dollops of federal money without the hassle of raising matching funds or
peer review.
Brown reveals that Wheeling Jesuit College in West Virginia, with only 1,000
full-time students, got Dollars 21m in 1992, and notes that Senator Robert
C. Byrd, chairman of the senate appropriations committee, is from West
Virginia.
Barons in Congress can legally require even the best-run agencies to award
research funds to institutions which all parties know are unlikely to pass
merit review.
The universities receiving the most pork since 1980 have been Iowa State
(Dollars 91.5m), University of Alaska (Dollars 91.2m) and Oregon Health
Sciences University (Dollars 84.9m).
Federal research managers may work closely with the university to draw up a
passable use for the funds. This may lessen waste but also takes up time the
managers need to devote to more important agency work. Or they simply write
a cheque. They dare not refuse because 'to do so would incur the wrath of
the appropriations committees, and that is not a price any executive
department is fully willing to pay', Brown concludes. 'No effective checks
on this power currently exist.' Except possibly embarrassment, a tactic
Brown has adopted by publishing his report.
It hits hard at hospital facilities to be built at 10 universities which
were earmarked in energy research appropriations over four years. As a
consequence, funding for the superconducting supercollider, the crown jewel
of US high-energy physics, was cut.
The amount diverted to medical facilities was Dollars 171.8m - or 60 per
cent of the Dollars 282m withheld from the supercollider. This underfunding
in turn caused schedule slips 'that, regrettably, contributed to the erosion
of support' for the supercollider in the House.
The House appropriations chairman, William H. Natcher, now favours limiting
the practice of earmarking and has banned earmarks for the first time in the
House version of the National Institutes of Health's budget.
President Bill Clinton's science adviser, Jack Gibbons, is on record as
being opposed to earmarks. With Brown's open criticism and Gibbons' stance,
the betting has been that earmarks would be reduced in 1993.
Until this summer, that is, when Clinton's five-year tax and debt-reduction
plan seemed on the verge of defeat and his presidency became hostage to the
demands of individual congressmen. Exactly what was promised to key members
in return for their votes is not known. But Bill Sarpalius of Texas
reportedly left a meeting with energy secretary Hazel O'Leary optimistic
that a nuclear weapons lab in Amarillo, Texas, might expand - and deciding
to vote as the president wished.
Only when Congress finishes with the budget and its massive reports are
published, will we know if 'pork' remains rampant, or if Brown is succeeding
in turning off this source of gold for non-competitive universities.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Wrangling leaves reform plan in the
balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Mr John Smith's reforms of the Labour party constitution remains
in the balance before tomorrow's vital vote, with lobbying attention
focusing on the constituency party activists and the handful of tiny unions
that could still swing the result.
For the first time at a Labour conference the constituencies hold the
balance of power, with 30 per cent of the vote. As many constituency
delegates are not clearly mandated on the issue of one-member-one-vote, the
Smith camp hopes a loyalist momentum will bring the minimum two-thirds of
delegates it needs.
The lobbying was partially overshadowed yesterday by explicit opposition to
Mr Smith's policy change from Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, and
by the lukewarm support expressed by the party's deputy leader Mrs Margaret
Beckett.
Mrs Beckett infuriated other Labour leaders by refusing to back Mr Smith
explicitly against union opponents such as Mr John Edmonds, leader of the
GMB.
'Nobody is disagreeing with John Smith over one-member-one-vote,' she said.
'Nobody's against it, but people have different preferences as to how it
should be exercised. Let's hope that on Wednesday those preferences are
resolved into one agreement behind which we can all unite.'
There was further disagreement between Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU
craft union, a strong supporter of the reforms, and Mr Edmonds.
Mr Jordan said Mr Edmonds was standing out for a continuing union presence
in the selection of parliamentary candidates because he was seeking 'common
ground' with the left-led TGWU general union, with which the GMB is hoping
to merge. 'It could be the costliest piece of ground in political history',
Mr Jordan said.
A spokesman for Mr Edmonds said the allegation was 'ludicrous' and the union
policy was driven by strong local and regional feeling.
Mr Jordan conceded that the vote would be extremely close and that movement
towards Mr Smith's position had 'slowed up' after a rush of support on
Sunday.
Some Smith supporters were speculating that the vote on the National
Executive Committee rule change in favour of one-member-one-vote might be
lost but a complex composite motion backed by the RMT rail union and Nupe,
the public service union, would be supported and could form the basis of a
new NEC proposal.
Some opponents of the reform say, however, that they would consider legal
action in the event of such a move, especially if one of the motions hostile
to one-member-one-vote was also passed.
The Smith camp could be saved by some smaller unions. One medium-sized union
which has been opposing the reforms has indicated that it is poised to
switch position at the last moment to support the NEC rule change.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Pragmatism taxes even the loyal masses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gordon Brown's comments earlier this week that he intended to reverse the
'unacceptable' gap between rich and poor were met with disbelief by
journalists and commentators. His words suggested he had rejected the
widely-accepted wisdom that the prospect of higher taxes was what lost
Labour the last election.
A large number of delegates at this week's conference would share that view.
It was to them, said Mr Brown's defenders, that he was directing his
comments.
Mr Brown may well distance himself from his comments once conference is
over, but a scan of grass roots opinion reveals why, at least for this week,
he felt the need to tread carefully.
A delegate from Blaby summed up the feeling of many Labour activists at a
meeting of the shadow treasury team yesterday: 'We have got the impression
from Gordon Brown that the very rich in this country will be allowed to keep
all those ill-gotten gains of the past decade.'
Like other delegates, she urged Labour to stick to a policy of raising the
income taxes of the better-off in Britain.
Agreeing on higher taxes for the rich is one thing, but agreeing on who is
rich is another.
One woman from the south-west suggested salaries of over Pounds 100,000
would be a good starting point for higher taxation. A delegate from
Maidstone suggested Pounds 50,000 while a visitor from Scotland said Pounds
36,000 - the point at which Mr Smith's proposals would have started to bite
 -was considered wealthy in Scotland.
Among activists, Labour's now abandoned tax-raising proposals do not feature
highly as a reason for why Labour lost the 1992 election.
'I would campaign tomorrow for higher taxes,' said the Maidstone delegate.
'People would accept them if they knew they were going to pay for better
services.'
'It wasn't the tax. We just didn't get the message across in the South
East,' said another Scottish visitor. 'John Smith's tax proposals didn't
lose us the election in Scotland.'
The mood was reflected in yesterday's economic debate. As one delegate
commented: 'People are not stupid. They know the money has to be found.'
Another pointed out that progressive taxation meant only one thing - income
tax.
If delegates had their way, Labour would march into the next election with
last year's tax proposals intact and more. But their thinking is strongly
out of line with a pragmatic Labour Treasury team.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Support for scrapping of opt-out schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFERENCE yesterday supported a motion to end school opt-outs and the
creation of grant-maintained schools.
It also called for nursery education to be available by right to all
children from the age of four and for financial support for all students
over 16 in full or part-time education.
Mr Graham Lane of the Socialist Education Association, who proposed the
motion, accused the government of 'bribery and corruption' in its eff-orts
to encourage schools to opt out.
Delegates expressed their contempt for the government's education reforms
during a debate in which Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said
Labour offered a vision of a learning society where education was not geared
to a privileged minority, 'but where all individuals are empowered to make
real decisions about their own lives'.
Ms Taylor said that the party rejected the 'simplistic, meaningless and
dangerous league tables' which were designed with the purpose of setting
schools against each other.
She also urged reform to post-16 education. 'Conservatives describe A-levels
as a gold standard,' she said. 'Well, it's pretty tarnished gold and it's
just not good enough for today's children, forcing them to make invidious,
narrow and out-of-date choices.'
Mrs Glenys Kinnock, prospective European parliamentary candidate for South
East Wales and wife of the former Labour leader, condemned government plans
for a 'mum's army' of teachers for the youngest primary school children,
dismissing the idea as 'crackpot'.
'Teachers are not insisting on an all-graduate profession because of vested
interests,' she said. 'It is children's interests that they are seeking to
defend.'
Later in the debate Mr Nicholas Russell of the Morecambe and Lunesdale
constituency party complained about government plans to reform student
unions which he said would limit the activities the unions could be involved
in.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Conference Notebook - No sign of the big
idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER under-estimate the legacy of the Lady. Thatcherism died in the
Conservative party three years ago with her departure from Downing Street.
Mr John Major is floundering still in the consequent ideological vacuum.
Now the electorate appears also to be disavowing the triumphant
individualism of the 1980s. Society and community have returned to the
lexicon of political respectability. After an economic recession which
ravaged the southern middle-classes, so too has the notion that governments
might have the ambition at least of full employment.
But the Labour party is as uncertain as the Tories how to fill the
philosophical gap. The message from its Brighton conference yesterday was a
curious mix of confidence, complacency and confusion.
On one side the so-called modernisers fretted over the ground they had lost
since the cold shower of last year's fourth election defeat had been
replaced by the warmer climate of the government's disarray. Mr Tony Blair
is in belligerent mood these days.
On what used to be called the soft left, Mr David Blunkett and Mrs Ann
Taylor relied on the well-tried tactic of attacking the Tories over health
and education while offering few clues as to their alternative strategies.
Leaving aside for a day or two the dispute over one-member-one-vote, Mr John
Edmonds of the GMB went on the offensive over the party's economic strategy.
In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, he
called for the party to break with the Tories' economic agenda. What was
wrong with spending and borrowing?
With large numbers of the delegates in Brighton convinced once again that
victory at the next election is only a matter of time, it is a seductive
strategy. It is being presented daily and with some eloquence by Mr Bryan
Gould, now the most powerful voice of dissent on the Labour backbenches.
For his part, Mr John Smith sat rather uneasily on the platform, convinced
that Labour cannot abort the process of change but reluctant to abandon the
traditionalist reflexes which sustained Labour in Scotland even through the
wilderness years of the 1980s.
His speech later today will combine an angry denunciation of the 'chaos' of
Mr Major's government with an assertion that wealth creation, full
employment and better public services are all part of the same picture. In
the jargon of the spin-doctors, it will be a put-Britain-back-to-work
speech.
But the pivotal figure for the moment remains Mr Brown. He has spent the
past year clearing the decks of tax and spending pledges made by Labour at
the last election. It has not made him very popular with Mr Edmonds et al,
and his friends say he has been feeling the heat.
So Mr Brown has now adopted a more populist tack. Despite all those prawn
cocktail lunches, he devoted a significant chunk of his speech to an attack
on City boardroom. Financiers, it seems, are to Labour conferences what
social security cheats are to Tory ones.
There was a more important message, though. For all his caution the shadow
chancellor has decided that Labour's economic strategy must be seen to be
expansionist.
He will not suggest tax increases beyond the closing of the lengthening list
of executive loopholes he publishes every other day (unless, that is, Mr
Kenneth Clarke gets there first). But the unifying goal is to be full
employment.
It is an approach designed to solve two problems. It should take some of the
internal pressure off Mr Brown, and it will give Labour a clear basis from
which to attack the government in the approach to the November Budget.
Tactically, it makes sense. The economy remains the government's weakest
point. Nothing could be more potent than unemployment for their
university-educated sons and daughters in shifting the allegiances of the
aspirant classes.
But it does not fill the vacuum. 'Found the big idea yet?' asked one member
of the shadow cabinet yesterday. 'Don't bother. There isn't one.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Cook puts case for workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S industrial strategy was based on a shift in power towards people
working in manufacturing industry and away from speculators, Mr Robin Cook,
the shadow trade secretary, emphasised yesterday.
He said the lack of rights for workers had been one of the reasons why the
recession in the UK had been steeper than in other European countries.
Multinational companies found it easier to make employees redundant in
Britain.
Speaking in an economic debate which saw successive speakers call for
greater rights, for example in union recognition and employment protection,
Mr Cook insisted that protection for workers and industrial recovery went
together. 'We won't build stability in the economy when we offer only
insecurity in the workplace'.
Mr Cook highlighted the commitment to long-term investment in the
consultation paper on industrial strategy which he published in April.
Its suggestions include encouraging pension funds and building societies to
channel personal savings into industry as well as property, reform of
takeover law to bring greater stability and representation of employees on
company boards.
He also underlined the need for regional development, saying that parts of
the UK outside south-east England should have a stronger role in economic
decisions, through regional development agencies.
Over the months since his paper had been published, he said, a further 18
coal pits had been shut because of the 'rigged' energy market the government
had created when it privatised electricity, and which a Labour
administration would end.
In the same period, some 30,000 more companies had gone bankrupt: 'Stephen
Dorrell tells us this government is creating an inflation-free world. What
worries me is they are creating a factory-free Britain,' he said.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Blunkett pledges to end 'two-tier'
health service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIR taxation and not private insurance and charges should ensure that
patients receive adequate treatment under the national health service, Mr
David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, told delegates.
He announced that later in the autumn a consultation paper would contain
proposals for ending the 'two-tier service' that had resulted from the
government's policy of allowing some family doctors to assume responsibility
for their own budgets.
Mr Blunkett said it would also contain proposals for ending the trust status
which had removed many hospitals from the control of local health
authorities.
He maintained that the internal market introduced by the government had
'failed abysmally', with hospital waiting lists exceeding one million for
the first time.
Mr Blunkett said the NHS was cracking at the seams and only the dedication
of the staff was holding it together.
To applause, he protested: 'The internal market is crucifying the NHS before
our eyes.' Labour's aim would be to put patients at the top of the agenda.
Mr Blunkett said: 'We all pay our taxes and should be entitled to the best
the NHS can give us'. He attacked the government's pay freeze for
public-sector workers, and claimed that the extension of VAT to domestic
fuel would cause illness.
Urging the party to rally to the 'beacon of hope and confidence for the
future' lit by Labour leader Mr John Smith, he declared: 'It's the Tories
that are the party of tax and cut, borrow and squander, sell-off and
sell-short.
'It's we that want decent, well-managed, well-afforded public services.'
He accepted a composite motion urging the next Labour government to restore
the NHS as a service 'free at the point of use' for all citizens.
The motion also pressed for the introduction of a levy on private hospitals
geared to the number of former NHS personnel they employ.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Benn loses seat in NEC election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BENN, MP for Chesterfield and a leftwing icon for two decades, lost
his seat on the party's national executive committee yesterday after 34
years.
The election result was greeted with cries of 'shame' and a standing
ovation. Mr Benn, 68, said ballot results 'speak for themselves'.
Mr Benn's defeat overshadowed a mixed verdict on the party's 'modernising'
wing, led by Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown,
shadow chancellor.
The poll was topped by Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, who has
emerged as a leading shadow cabinet supporter of 'traditionalist' opposition
to the modernisers.
Mr Blair increased his share of the vote in the constituency section, but
failed to improve his standing from sixth of the seven members elected.
Mr Brown moved down the table from third to seventh, reflecting opposition
among constituency delegates to his attempts to distance Labour from the
'tax and spend' manifesto on which it fought the 1992 general election.
However, Ms Harriet Harman, a shadow treasury spokesman and close associate
of Mr Brown, was elected for the first time in second place with 548,000
votes.
Ms Harman, who benefited from a rule change reserving one of the seven seats
for a female candidate, scored a convincing victory over Ms Dawn Primarolo,
a leftwing health spokesman, who polled only 58,000 votes.
The other successful candidates, Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr Robin Cook, both
increased their share of the vote. Mr Kinnock slipped from first to third,
while Mr Cook moved up from fifth to fourth.
Mr Benn refused to be drawn on the recent rightwards drift of the NEC, from
which all supporters of the leftwing Campaign Group have been removed.
However, he said that interventions from the floor of conference, which tend
to be more leftwing than those from the leadership, offered a better guide
to the party's future.
Mr Benn's defeat marks the end of an era on the NEC, which he joined in 1959
as a rightwinger. He later came to epitomise a radical brand of socialism,
but had lost influence since Labour's shattering election defeat in 1983.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Social justice body to probe tax and
pension benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATION into integrating the tax and benefit system for pensioners
is to be carried out by Labour's social justice commission, Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Brown said that he and Mr Donald Dewar, the social security spokesman,
wanted to see the end of means-testing pensioners to see if they were
eligible for state benefits.
But there was a setback for the leadership when conference defied the
national executive committee and supported a motion calling for equalisation
of the pension age at 60 - by almost 60 per cent of the vote to just over 30
per cent.
Labour's policy is to support a flexible decade of retirement, and the
government is expected to announce shortly plans to equalise the state
pensions age at 65. Labour is certain to be pressed to explain how it would
pay for the earlier pension age for men.
At a fringe meeting later, Mr Dewar urged the refocusing of the social
security system in order to tackle the ways in which it encouraged
dependency.
He said that Labour could not simply defend the welfare system of the late
1970s and argue that it just required better funding.
Instead, it needed to address issues such as the high marginal rate of
withdrawals from a combination of tax and benefits, which acted as a
disincentive to people on income support to take up work.
He added, however, that in his view the social security system was
sustainable in the short-term, and attacked right-wing ministers for using
the immediate problem of government borrowing as cover for bringing in major
changes to the welfare state.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Pounds 100m aid urged for bus operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOTOR industry yesterday urged the government to commit up to Pounds
100m a year to help operators modernise the UK's 30,000 large city buses.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the move would reduce
traffic congestion and substantially improve air quality through
low-pollution 'green' buses. The Confederation of British Industry estimates
that congestion costs the UK Pounds 15bn a year.
The SMMT said in a pre-Budget submission to the Department of Transport and
the chancellor that bus operators were no longer earning enough to replace
buses. The number of passenger seats available was therefore continuing to
decline and the existing bus fleet was deteriorating.
If current trends continued, by the end of the decade the number of bus
seats available would fall by 35 per cent, only 21 per cent of buses would
meet even minimum EC exhaust emissions standards and more than half of buses
would be 15 years or more old.
The submission calls for 100 per cent first-year capital allowances on new
vehicles, a subsidy of up to 15 per cent on the price of new buses meeting
latest environmental standards, and an extra allowance of up to 10 per cent
of the price if an old bus was scrapped.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Lloyd's chief in threat to quit over reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER MIDDLETON, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, yesterday
threatened to resign if his plans for the introduction of corporate capital
into the insurance market were not approved.
He said that he and Mr David Rowland, the chairman, would quit unless Names
 -the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - supported them at an
extraordinary general meeting called for October 20.
The warning came at a regional meeting in London yesterday afternoon of the
Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names group, and was confirmed
last night by officials.
'They (Middleton and Rowland) are there to see the business plan through and
if it fails they are off,' a spokesman for Lloyd's said.
Mr Middleton's threat represents an escalation of the intensifying campaign
by Lloyd's to ensure that its sweeping proposals announced in a new business
plan in April are implemented.
The centrepiece is the introduction for the first time of money pledged by
corporate investors, who would not be subject to the unlimited liability
requirements imposed on Names.
Mr Rowland wrote to all Names last week urging them to support Lloyd's
proposals. 'I believe that access to new capital is necessary to ensure that
we can continue to trade as a significant force in the international market
place,' he said.
Lloyd's announced the extraordinary general meeting last month in an effort
to head off any action by dissident loss-making Names that could delay the
entry of the new 'incorporated Names'.
It did so in spite of a previous egm held in July, which overwhelmingly
endorsed the idea of corporate capital and defeated motions of no confidence
proposed by dissident Names.
All 32,000 Names on the market will be entitled to vote at the meeting,
including many who have become insolvent following recent heavy underwriting
losses.
Mr Brian Garraway, who was deputy chairman of the Council of Lloyd's and
first chairman of its regulatory board since the start of this year, has
died.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Yard heads back to black: The Govan shipyard in Glasgow as
it looks forward to its first profit for 30 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KVAERNER Govan, the Norwegian-owned shipyard in Glasgow, believes its
five-year struggle to become profitable is nearing success. It expects to
make a small profit this year, and believes this will be the yard's first
operating profit for 30 years.
'It's been five years of doubts and disappointments, but finally, finally we
have black figures,' says Mr Diderik Schnitler, head of shipbuilding at
Kvaerner, the quoted Oslo-based engineering, shipbuilding and shipping group
which owns Govan.
The yard has lost about Pounds 30m since Kvaerner acquired it in 1988 from
British Shipbuilders. In the preceding four years it lost Pounds 140m.
Kvaerner Govan now has a strong though not completely full order book. It
will deliver four chemical tankers worth about Pounds 200m between now and
1995. The first, a 35,000dwt vessel for J. O. Odfjell of Bergen, is to be
named by the Queen at Govan next week.
Govan broke new ground in May when it won a subcontract from VSEL to build
the hull, engines and platform of a new helicopter carrier for the Royal
Navy. Swan Hunter on Tyneside failed to win the helicopter carrier contract
 -worth Pounds 170m to VSEL - and called in the receiver. Last week Kvaerner
Govan won clearance from the Ministry of Defence to tender to build
replacements for the Royal Navy's two assault ships.
Kvaerner sees crossing the break-even mark as the fruit of its long struggle
to reduce operating costs and raise productivity at Govan. It wanted Govan,
which it bought for Pounds 6m, because the yard is entitled to EC
shipbuilding subsidies not available in Norway. At the time they were 28 per
cent but have since been reduced to 9 per cent.
The first ship that Govan built under its new owners, a liquefied petroleum
gas tanker, required twice as many man hours to complete as would have been
necessary at Kvaerner's yards in Norway.
Since then the number of man hours needed to build a ship has improved to
1.4 times Norwegian levels. The Kvaerner management has whittled away at
restrictive practices and improved labour productivity by 30 per cent. The
number of office staff has been cut by a third to under 300, while the
overall number of permanent employees is 1,500.
Kvaerner has invested Pounds 31m at Govan. The figure includes an Pounds 11m
tank assembly shed which makes it possible for units weighing up to 1,500
tonnes to be built under cover.
The cost of materials, which represents 60 per cent of a ship's cost, has
been cut by 15 per cent by using the purchasing muscle of the group.
'We have combined two shipbuilding cultures, the Norwegian and the
Scottish,' says Mr Kjell Mikalsen, who became managing director last year.
'But we still need to achieve a further 40 per cent reduction in man hours.'
Plans for further cost-cutting are not likely to involve reducing the
workforce - on the contrary, employment levels could rise if more orders are
won and can be met economically. The yard has the capacity to build three
ships a year; at present it builds two.
A three-year productivity programme is seeking to make improvements by
designing ships which are simpler to build and by giving more responsibility
to teams of workers. 'We now want them to work smarter, not harder,' says Mr
Tom Bateman, finance director.
Last year the yard made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.5m on turnover of Pounds
74m. The small profit expected this year will still be a poor return on
Kvaerner's investment at Govan.
The Treasury takes about 50 per cent of profit on ships built with subsidy.
Earlier this year the clawback on new contracts was reduced to 9 per cent
and Kvaerner is pressing to have that rate applied to existing contracts.
'No other EC shipbuilding country operates a clawback,' Mr Shnitler says.
So why is Kvaerner continuing to build ships at Govan? The move into naval
work is a breakthrough because warships are not subject to subsidy or
clawback. Govan has succeeded in convincing the MoD that its standards on
gas and chemical carriers are as rigorous as those on war-ships.
Govan should now make bigger profits, especially if productivity improves
further. The group is expecting a worldwide upturn in orders for new ships -
it believes that the rate of renewal in the world fleet, currently running
at 4 per cent a year, is set to rise to 6 per cent.
Few shipbuilders have the capacity to meet these orders profitably but the
Kvaerner group, whose shipyards have an order book second only to that of
Hyundai of South Korea, is one of them.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Thatcher picks at Tory wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING should stay out of the European exchange rate mechanism, Lady
Thatcher, the former prime minister (pictured above with Sir Teddy Taylor),
told Conservative loyalists last night in a speech which threatened to
reopen Tory wounds on Europe just a week before the party's annual
conference, David Owen writes.
Making a rare speech to a Conservative constituency association, she also
said that it would be a mistake for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to
raise taxes in his November Budget.
Lady Thatcher said she would never have signed the Maastricht treaty because
of the shift towards federalism it would bring about. Speaking in the
Southend East constituency of Sir Teddy, the arch Euro-sceptic Tory MP, she
said the British people had their own way of doing things and did not want
to be swamped by Europe.
Tory activists at the Pounds 35-a-head event - which was marked by a huge
police security operation - could not recall her making a single reference
to Mr John Major, the prime minister, or to the current state of the Tory
party.

FT  28 SEP 93 / 'Talking shop' for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ARRAY OF leading bankers, civil servants and industrialists gathered at
Mansion House in the City yesterday to launch a new foundation for the study
of manufacturing and industry.
Sir Trevor Holdsworth, its chairman, said the foundation was a
self-confessed talking shop 'because the future of Britain's manufacturing
industry is a subject which deserves to be talked about'.
He likened the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry to similar bodies
studying foreign policy, defence and social issues. But he said that, while
they were concerned with spending money, the foundation would focus on the
basics of wealth creation.
Launching the foundation, Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said it
could be 'a unique source of debate and a valued sponsor of research' on the
future of Britain's manufacturing industry.
The foundation has attracted more than Pounds 200,000 in funding including
Pounds 150,000 from founding corporate sponsors and Pounds 50,000 a year for
three years from the Comino Foundation, an educational charity.
It plans to hold monthly meetings, lectures and seminars. The inaugural
lecture will be in mid November.
Four principal areas of research have been highlighted: culture; managerial
and economic policy; the role of industry in society; and the fostering of
common objectives between industry, the City, government and universities.

FT  28 SEP 93 / 'Nuclear dustbin' charge levelled at Thorp operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 90 per cent of foreign radioactive waste sent for reprocessing at the
controversial Thorp plant in Sellafield, Cumbria, could remain in the UK
permanently, Greenpeace claimed yesterday.
The pressure group, which does not want the Pounds 2.8bn plant to be given a
licence to start operation, argues that Sellafield will become a 'nuclear
dustbin' for foreign radioactive waste if Thorp is given the go-ahead.
The claims are contained in a 40-page report commissioned by Greenpeace from
Large &amp; Associates, London-based consultants, and published today.
The report says that British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, gave evidence
to the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee
suggesting it has agreed to send back only 11 per cent of foreign waste.
The report further claims that BNF wants to send back no more 1 per cent of
foreign waste, measured by volume. Under a policy known as 'substitution',
BNF plans to send customers more highly radioactive waste in exchange for
keeping bulky low and intermediate level waste - saving the customer
transport costs.
BNF said last night that contracts signed since 1976 allowed it to return
all waste produced. Cumbria County Council is expected to back the start-up
of Thorp when all 83 councillors meet next Monday, the last day for public
consultation on the project.
However the working party to the council, whose views are based on
independent research commissioned by the council, recommends that start-up
should go ahead only if the plant can be shown to meet all safety criteria.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Falklands 'voice' for Scott evidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN McDONALD, the distinctive voice of the government during the
Falklands war in 1982, is to appear before the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
The former acting chief of public relations at the Ministry of Defence,
responsible for disseminating information to the media, is to be questioned
on October 6 about his subsequent role in vetting sensitive defence exports
to Iraq during the 1980s.
As the head of the ministry's Defence Export Services Secretariat, he is
expected to shed some light on why colleagues ignored warnings about the
export of machine tools by British companies contributing to a build-up of
Iraq's defence capability.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Tendering clause for council staff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW GUIDANCE to be issued by the department of the environment covering
compulsory competitive tendering says councils can in some cases reject bids
from private contractors which do not intend to use the council's staff for
the work.
The guidance deals with the application to tendering of the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Where the Tupe
regulations apply, a successful bidder must take over the workforce on their
existing terms and conditions.
The environment department note says contractors should be asked if their
bids assume Tupe applies.
If the local authority has legal advice that Tupe applies but the bid
assumes that it does not, the contractor should be invited to reconsider the
bid.
If the contractor refuses to submit a revised bid, the authority can turn it
down, even if it is the cheapest.

FT  28 SEP 93 / College leavers find work prospects still gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a third of students funded by Lancashire County Council who left
university or college last year have found jobs related to the subjects they
studied, and one in eight were still unemployed after nearly a year.
Most who found jobs went into large public-sector organisations such as
schools, colleges, the health service, the Civil Service and councils.
Few employers were small or medium-sized companies, a survey of people who
received student grants from Lancashire and sat final examinations in 1991
and 1992 has found. The students went to universities or colleges throughout
Britain.
Unemployment was 7.5 per cent among those who qualified in 1991.
Holders of Higher National Diplomas were almost twice as likely to be
unemployed as those with bachelor degrees. A quarter of final-year students
in 1992 went back to full-time study, many to enhance qualifications and
improve job prospects after failing to find work. Upgrading HNDs to bachelor
degrees was common.
The survey by East Lancashire Training and Enterprise Council analysed
responses from 4,118 people - 39 per cent of those who received funding for
their higher education from the county council.
Those who graduated in medicine, science, law and business administration
found work fastest. Unemployment was highest among those who took art and
design, mass communications, construction or the humanities. Students with
first-class honours were four times less likely to be unemployed than those
with thirds. Job chances were poorest for mature students and those from
ethnic minorities.
Personal and family contacts were important for finding work, the survey
indicated, so that those from more affluent districts tended to do better
because of parental networks.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Regeneration scheme opens in Bristol
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1.5m project funded by the public and private sectors was launched
yesterday by Sir George Young, environment minister, to provide training and
jobs in a deprived part of Bristol.
Sir George described the project as one of the most ambitious of its kind
and said it would help restore confidence in Hartcliffe, south Bristol - an
area of high unemployment and the scene of riots last year.
The Gatehouse project, which will provide a centre with enterprise
workshops, training facilities, meeting rooms and a creche, was part of the
city's failed bid for the government's City Challenge scheme.
The Department of the Environment is providing an urban partnership grant of
Pounds 500,000. The city council is donating Pounds 500,000 and providing
the site for a peppercorn rent. The balance is being raised from more than
20 companies. British Telecommunications yesterday donated Pounds 100,000.
The Gatehouse project is being led by Hartcliffe and Withywood Ventures, an
enterprise and community development agency.

FT  28 SEP 93 / US company to create 660 jobs in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VALENCE TECHNOLOGY, the US electronics company, is to create 660 jobs in
Northern Ireland by investing Pounds 76m in a factory making an advanced
rechargeable battery.
It is one of the biggest inward investment projects won so far by the
province's Industrial Development Board.
The plant, at Mallusk on the outskirts of Belfast, will start production
early in 1994 with full staffing expected by 1998.
Valence already has a Pounds 65m agreement to supply batteries from the
plant to Motorola, the world's biggest maker of portable radios and cellular
communication products. It also has a Pounds 13m contract with Delco Remy, a
subsidiary of General Motors, to develop Valence technology for automotive
uses.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the plant would
become Valence's main production centre for the new battery, selling to
customers worldwide.
He added: 'I am also pleased that Valence are showing the depth of their
confidence in Northern Ireland's technological expertise by setting up a
research and development facility here.'
Mr Cal Reed, Valence president, said Ulster was chosen because 'it is a good
fit with our strategic plan in that a supportive pro-business climate exists
and we have access to a good workforce, particularly university-educated
engineers, making it possible for us to begin production as soon as
possible'.
Valence's battery is based on lithium and polymer technologies and the
company's decision to locate in Northern Ireland will give the province
direct contact with decision makers in the electronics companies of Silicon
Valley in the US.
The company has been making prototypes at its San Jose plant since 1991 and
claims the battery now ready to move into production has a longer operating
life and reduced size and weight.
Mr Reed said: 'Our batteries offer significant advantages over the much
heavier conventional batteries which currently power cellphones, portable
computers, camcorders and hand-held tools.'
Seagate Technology - another 'Valley' company - will start production in
Londonderry next year, making components for computer disc drives and
eventually employing 500 people. Sir Patrick said the decision by the IDB to
open its first office in Silicon Valley had been validated by the two
investments.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Tecs attack 'barrier to training'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPTAKE OF Investors in People, the government's main national initiative to
improve the training of employees, is being hampered by red tape, Training
and Enterprise Councils said yesterday.
The employer-led Tecs, which promote the scheme, said they found it
'difficult if not impossible' to gain access to the Pounds 10m offered by
the government this year to match any funds that Tecs could raise for the
scheme.
Investors in People (IIP) helps participating companies to develop employee
training and to match people more effectively to the needs of corporate
plans.
Tecs fear they are unlikely to get more than 10 per cent of the Pounds 10m
on offer.
Mr Julian Blackwell, chairman of the Oxford-based Heart of England Tec,
said: 'Investors in People is a success and will be even more successful in
the future.
'But because of this funding problem it will take us longer to promote it to
employers than we would wish. The skills situation in this country is such
that we have not got that time.'
Heart of England has persuaded employers of more than 9 per cent of the
workforce in its area to join the scheme.
Tecs are given no budget by the government for promoting the scheme. But
they are allowed to use on it savings made from government-funded programmes
for the unemployed which they administer.
Tecs promote IIP to employers in their areas, often offering free advice on
whether the companies need to change their personnel practices to meet the
scheme's demands.
However, matching funds cannot be used for salaries of Tec employees
promoting the scheme, promotional literature, seminars, general marketing of
the scheme or for diagnostic work.
Mr Blackwell said the prescriptive nature of matched funding caused problems
even when Tecs were eligible to apply for the funds. It virtually excluded
the provision of matching funds to help public-sector organisations.
The Department of Employment said the Pounds 10m had been ring-fenced for
the purpose of providing companies with advice, guidance and assistance on
how to achieve IIP. Other money, it said, was available to Tecs.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Obituary of Sir Owen Aisher: Reforming a market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR OWEN AISHER, who died last weekend aged 93, took the small family
building business he joined in 1924 and created one of the Britain's leading
building materials companies: Marley.
Owen Arthur Aisher was born in on May 28 1900, the eldest of six children,
all of whom became involved in the family business. His father, Owen Aisher,
was a plasterer by trade, but after the Boer War worked as a civilian at the
army camp, where young Owen was educated.
After the first world war, in which he served as a motorcycle despatch
rider, Sir Owen joined the Metropolitan Police as a constable, moving in
1920 to Scotland Yard as one of the first motorcycle policemen. Weekends saw
him cycling down to Harrietsham in Kent to help his father, then running a
small housebuilding business. In 1924 he joined his father full-time.
Like other small builders, the Aishers had been making a few concrete roof
tiles on site when the traditional product was unavailable. The concrete
tile had been available in the UK for 30 years, but was not popular. Within
decade, the Aisher family had developed their garden-shed business into the
largest roofing tile manufacturer and the largest roofing contractor in the
country.
Sir Owen's early selling experience determined his lifetime marketing
philosophy. Traditional builders' merchants showed little interest in the
new concrete tile and, throughout his career, Sir Owen maintained that the
builders' merchant was no more than a provider of goods which already had a
market. When he tried to sell tiles directly to builders, he found them
resistant to new methods of fixing. Sir Owen's response was to offer not
just the tiles but to fix the whole roof.
Thus Marley's 'supply and fix' philosophy was born. By 1932 Marley had
become the country's largest roofing contractor. Sir Owen had found a unique
formula. He produced in volume and sold aggressively into one of Britain's
most conservative industries.
Sir Owen's father had been in equal partnership with Arthur Blackman, a
prominent coal merchant and five times Lord Mayor of Hastings. Blackman
finance was needed for the original tile factory at Harrietsham, leaving the
family with only one third of the equity; the construction of two more
factories diluted the Aisher interests further.
The conflict of interest and personality between Sir Owen, who by 1930 was
in effect running the business, and his sleeping partner nearly led to the
break-up of Marley. Eventually it was agreed that the Marley companies
should be sold, a process that took more than two years to complete. The
Blackman interests were bought by Sir James Dunn and Dean Finance, part of
British American Tobacco; the Aisher family holding was increased to around
one third and Marley was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1935.
After the second world war, Sir Owen became one of the leaders in the
development of plastic products for the building trade. In wartime visits to
the US he had seen asphalt flooring, and he believed that there would be a
post-war timber shortage leading to houses being built with concrete floors.
He recognised that people would need a quality product to cover such floors.
Against the advice of his non-executive directors, Marley began to build its
first floor-tile factory. Production began in spring 1948 - a few months
after Dunlop but ahead of Armstrong of the US. Still no more than a small
company, Marley competed head-on with two much larger concerns and emerged
with the largest market share.
Through the use of plastics, Marley sought to widen its sphere of interest,
eventually spreading as far as the motor industry. The Aishers extended the
philosophy of creating their own market through the development of Payless,
its merchanting and do-it-yourself retailing business.
Marley tried to establish itself overseas after the war. The shape of the
company's extensive overseas manufacturing interests was determined in the
1950s when the Aishers chose to develop the plastic flooring business. As a
new product it was thought to provide more opportunities for Marley's
supply-and-fix philosophy. In the 1950s a network of plants was developed
across Europe and deep into the the southern hemisphere.
During the 1970s the group began to lose its way. It suffered from capital
limitations which were, to a degree, imposed by Sir Owen's desire to
maintain family control. More significant was a conflict over marketing
philosophies, in particular Sir Owen's commitment to supply and fix against
the opposition of most of his colleagues, and Marley's position as a
competitor to its own customers.
The internal conflict was symptomatic of a management structure rooted in a
successful family business and unable to come to terms with the passing of
the years.
Interviewed by Building magazine in 1978, Sir Owen stated forcefully his
views on the role of the family. 'One of the things we older people deplore
is a lack of family. The invention of the word nepotism is all part of the
academic idea of denigrating family. In other words, if you work for your
family and create a job for your son, they suggest it's wrong . . . We look
after ourselves first, on the basis that if we're strong and healthy, we can
do something for the other fellow.'
Sir Owen stood down as chairman of Marley in October 1982, becoming life
president. There had been a difficult annual general meeting earlier in the
year and pressure was growing, both from inside the company and from the
City. Although he remained a director, Sir Owen no longer attended board
meetings. Shortly after he retired as chairman, he sold the majority of his
Marley shareholding.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Kuwaiti paper warns of pull-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Kuwait's leading independent newspapers warned yesterday that the
emirate might be unwilling to invest in the UK if it lost its valuable
sovereign immunity from taxation.
In an editorial, the al-Qabas newspaper reacted strongly to what it called
'the astonishing . . . threats and intimidation about rescinding tax
exemption'.
Last week the FT disclosed that Kuwait may have abused the immunity by
receiving more than Pounds 600m of tax refunds on a Dollars 1.7bn investment
in British Petroleum.
At the weekend Lord Shawcross, one of Kuwait's most distinguished and
long-standing UK advisers, warned of the potential immunity loss in a letter
to a senior member of the emirate's ruling Al-Sabah family.
Yesterday, however, Whitehall officials reacted cautiously to any threat of
investment withdrawal from the UK, pointing out that al-Qabas does not
necessarily reflect Kuwaiti government thinking.
Although the Kuwaiti state sold off some of its UK assets to pay for the
Gulf War, the Kuwaitis still have extensive landholding and other
investments in Britain.
The Foreign Office and the Department and Trade and Industry said yesterday
they had received no approach from the Kuwaiti government expressing concern
on the tax issue.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Howard to discuss firefighter pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCIL LEADERS will tell Mr Michael Howard, home secretary today, that the
government must take the blame if there is a firefighters' strike. They are
due to meet this morning for talks on the future of the 15-year-old
firefighters pay formula.
'If the government does not agree to honour the formula - which in the past
it has supported - then we will potentially be faced with a serious dispute
entirely of the government's making,' warned Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of
the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, and Ms Josie Farrington,
chairwoman of the Association of County Councils, in a joint statement
yesterday. They added that a dispute would result in costs for the provision
of emergency cover. 'We will ask the home secretary who he intends should
pay for this in the event of industrial action,' they said.
'Instead of the Home Office advising fire authorities - possibly at their
own expense - to draw up plans for strike action, the government should be
working with the employers to find a way of averting a dispute. We hope
today's talks will achieve this.'
The employers say the provision of a back-up service for one day, with Green
Goddesses and troops to deal with emergencies, would cost more than meeting
the firefighters' pay formula in full. 'The cost of a strike would outweigh
any benefits achieved,' said Mr Tony Ritchie, chairman of the Metropolitan
Authorities fire committee.
If today's meeting at the Home Office fails to provide employers with room
for financial manoeuvre, there is the strong possibility of a series of
one-day strikes, starting in the second week of November.
The Fire Brigades Union is due to ballot 50,000 firefighters next Monday,
asking for their support for one-day strikes. The result will be known on
November 1.
The union's leaders are due to meet the employers on Friday, when they hope
agreement on this year's pay formula can be reached, as well as a commitment
for next year.
The size of the increase the firefighters could expect in November under the
formula will be known on Thursday when the government's earnings survey for
1993 is published. This provides the basis for the firefighters' award as
their pay is linked to the upper quartile of full-time male manual earnings.
The employers have already intimated they will meet this year's formula in
full.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Slide in business failures boosts upturn hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY hopes have been buoyed by the biggest yearly drop in business
failures since the recession started, figures published today show.
Business collapses in England and Wales for the third quarter of this year
were a fifth down on the corresponding period last year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
the business information company collating the figures, said they marked a
'turning point' in the economic upturn.
The statistics underline how higher demand from consumers and industry in
the past six months has reduced the financial strain on many companies. The
fall in failures has been most noticeable for big companies, with many small
businesses still being forced under by difficulties in raising cash from
banks.
The latest figures make it unlikely that total collapses for the year will
exceed last year's 51,947, which marked a big jump from the 39,827 failures
in 1991.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that 10,320 businesses failed in the third quarter
after 12,867 in the same period in 1992 and 13,235 in the second quarter of
this year. The number of collapses in the third quarter was the lowest for
any quarter in two years.
In the first nine months, 36,203 enterprises collapsed, a fall of 6 per cent
on the 38,550 failures between January and September last year.
Over the same period, liquidations of large registered companies dropped 13
per cent to 14,674 from 16,897. However, small-business bankruptcies dropped
to 21,529 from 21,653, a fall of just 0.6 per cent.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet marketing manager, warned that
small-business failures have not necessarily peaked because of their 'lack
of financial resource to provide the working capital for growth'.
Larger companies generally have relatively solid forms of financial support
such as share capital, while smaller groups often rely on bank loans and
overdrafts.
The biggest drop in business failures over the first nine months was in
Wales, which showed a 20 per cent fall on the same period last year. The
next biggest decline was in London, with 12 per cent, while the east
Midlands and the eastern region saw decreases of 8 per cent and 7 per cent.
Third-quarter figures for Scotland were distorted by changes in Scottish
bankruptcy laws which meant that third-quarter bankruptcies totalled only
489 after 2,095 in the same quarter last year.
This distortion means total failures in the third quarter in Scotland are
recorded as just 601 compared with 2,956 in the equivalent period last year
and 3,770 between April and June this year.
In the first nine months failures in south-east England excluding London
declined 4 per cent on the same period last year. The West Midlands and
north-west England saw an equivalent decline in failures, while collapses in
north-east England fell 2 per cent.
Counting England, Wales and Scotland, total business failures for the first
nine months of the year came to 43,369 after 46,545 in the same period last
year.

THE ABSENCE of an annual fee is the most important criterion for consumers
for choosing a credit card, according to a Gallup survey for TSB.
The survey of 1,012 adults found that 46 per cent of cardholders felt no fee
was the most important factor when choosing; 29 per cent said a low monthly
rate of interest was the most important.

INDUSTRY cannot afford the Pounds 13bn cost of sick days off work, Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, warned yesterday.
Alcohol, smoking-related diseases and mental illness were mainly
responsible, she told a Confederation of British Industry conference.
Mrs Bottomley said: 'Avoidable ill-health is a burden the country cannot
afford.
'In 1979 strikes cost our country 29m lost working days. Today we lose twice
that through alcohol and tobacco-related illness every year.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / P&amp;O to shed 450 workers next year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O European Ferries, the largest UK ferry operator, yesterday announced
plans to shed up to 450 jobs from its workforce of more than 6,000, Charles
Batchelor writes.
The cuts are a response to the prospect of competition from the Channel
tunnel, due to open next year, and new technologies which have reduced the
demand for staff on shore and at sea.
P&amp;O said it expected to dispense with up to 250 jobs on its nine Dover-based
ships and a further 200 shore-based positions at Dover. The company hopes to
achieve the cuts by voluntary redundancies.
P&amp;O said no cuts would occur before next year, but it could not guarantee
there would be no further reductions.
The cuts are expected to fall among ships crews, from officers to ratings
and among reservations and port operations staff. On board ship new
computerised radio equipment has meant vessels no longer need specialist
radio officers.

FT  28 SEP 93 / FT Financial Reporting Conference: Delay in audit reform
sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING British companies yesterday called for delays to proposed auditing
standards reforms until new accounting standards have been developed
further.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief finance officer of Reed Elsevier and chairman of
the technical committee of the Hundred Group of leading finance directors,
called for greater focus in financial reporting.
Speaking at the FT Financial Reporting Conference in London yesterday, he
said there were too many initiatives with too little co-ordination under
way.
He called for standards-setters to focus on 'priority issues' and avoid
topics outside the area of improved financial reporting.
'There is a risk of reform overload,' he said.
He also stressed the need for more authoritative guidance on implementing
the Cadbury code on corporate governance, and warned that the guidelines on
internal controls being drafted were too broad.
Mr James Carty, technical partner at accountants Robson Rhodes, criticised
the Accounting Standards Board for acting too slowly, generating standards
which were too confusing and poorly written, and for failing to distinguish
the need for different standards for smaller companies.
Mr Mike Townsend, finance director of Rolls-Royce, said FRS 3, the new
profit-and-loss account standard, 'is not helpful in understanding the real
dynamics and trading position and trends' of his company.
He said there was little consistency in the way in which City analysts
interpreted Rolls-Royce's 1992 results, which were prepared according to the
new standard.
He cited the earnings per share and p/e ratios quoted by five leading City
investment houses following the results, which produced widely varying
figures.
The numbers ranged from a loss per share of 20.9p from Paribas to earnings
of 6.6p from Henderson Crosthwaite. He said that if analysts provided such
varied interpretations, private investors would be even more confused by the
new standard.
Mr Jim McCaughan, managing director of UBS International Investment in
London, defended City analysts. He said much comment related to the
activities of brokers' research departments.
He drew a distinction between these readers of accounts - often accused of
short-termism - and investment managers, whose research is longer-term and
given no publicity.
He said he sympathised with companies' attempts to put 'a positive spin on
events' but said auditors needed to be stronger to ensure this spin did not
go beyond the requirement for accounts to show 'a true and fair view'.
Mr Richard Goeltz, director and group chief financial officer at National
Westminster Bank, said the ASB's proposed clampdown on capital instruments
and off-balance-sheet finance would reduce demand from financial advisers to
produce treatments designed with 'cosmetic enhancement' as their main aim.
But he said there was an 'increasingly aggressive' market among advisers to
devise 'tailored financial instruments to resolve real problems'.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Ministers seek to reopen Ulster talks with Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of the Irish Republic yesterday confirmed that an Anglo-Irish
working party is attempting to 'reconcile differences' in putting together a
draft constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland with a view to reviving
the stalled inter-party talks on the province.
But it has also reaffirmed that the Republic's constitutional claim to
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be modified to an 'aspiration' only
in the context of an overall settlement.
It emerged at the weekend that both governments had recently instructed
their civil servants to draw up a draft constitutional settlement paper by
the end of October which could be tabled at a new round of inter-party
talks.
The Irish government insisted yesterday that the constitutional issue 'will
only be dealt with through a referendum which is part of an overall and
balanced settlement'.
For the UK, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said there would
be 'no change whatever' in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland
without the consent of its people.
In Dublin an Irish foreign ministry spokesman said that 'different political
and constitutional scenarios are being discussed and a joint (Anglo-Irish)
working party is engaged in reconciling differences between the two
government positions'.
But there was a sense of confusion and perplexity in Dublin over the turn of
events on the Northern Ireland issue, and suspicion that the latest
statements coming from the British government 'are not unconnected with the
Hume story', according to one official source.
Last Saturday Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour
party, and Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, announced that they are to
submit a joint report to the Irish government on the progress so far of
their bilateral talks, which have been taking place since last April.
Proposals contained in the report are believed to set out a mechanism
through which the IRA could be persuaded to abandon its 23-year military
campaign, and which would then lead to an inclusion of Sinn Fein in the
round-table talks process.
It is thought that Mr Hume's current visit to the US is to seek a US
government-appointed mediator to facilitate 'arms-length' contact between
Sinn Fein and the British and Irish governments.
An Irish government spokesman said: 'The government's objective has always
been to try and stop the killing and establish a lasting peace (in Northern
Ireland) . . . the government looks forward to hearing what progress may
have been achieved in the talks between Mr Hume and Mr Adams.'
A source close to Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, said that Mr
Reynolds 'will not be walking away from any proposal that might bring about
(a political settlement)'. Mr Hume is due to brief Mr Reynolds in Dublin
next week after his US visit.
As Downing Street confirmed that the government was trying 'very hard' to
get the talks process back on the rails, Sir Patrick stressed that the
government would not 'talk or negotiate with' anyone who perpetrates or
justifies acts of violence, in a statement pegged to yesterday's bomb
explosion in Belfast.
Lord Hulme, Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, said it was
dangerous that 'two separate blueprints for the future' now seemed to be in
draft.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Victorian canal restored for tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Victorian canal which was a financial disaster, attracting only eight
fare-paying barges in its entire working life, has been restored as a
tourist facility, Jim Kelly writes.
The Pounds 28m project, which straddles the Ulster border, received funds
from the European Regional Development Fund's Interreg programme, designed
to promote co-operation between divided communities.
The Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal, which links Northern Ireland's Lough
Erne to the Irish Republic's River Shannon, was opened in 1860 but abandoned
in 1869 because of competition from the railways.
The 40-mile waterway has been cleared and rebuilt and the 16 locks fitted
with computerised hydraulics. Mr Terry McGovern, marketing manager for the
company marketing the waterway, said it was expected to attract in
particular German, Swiss, Dutch and French tourists on cruising holidays and
anglers from Britain.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Akbar was 'chief engineer' on BCCI ship of fraud: John Mason
profiles a central figure in the bank's misuse of Pounds 1.3bn depositor
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SAYED ALI AKBAR, the former head of Bank of Credit amd Commerce
International's treasury division, was a central figure in the epic
worldwide fraud perpetrated by the bank, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.
Although he reported directly to Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the BCCI founder and
chairman, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its chief executive, Mr Akbar was the 'chief
engineer' of the bank's dishonest financial manoeuvring which resulted in
the misuse of Pounds 1.3bn of depositors' funds, the court heard.
Mr Timothy Langdale QC presented the case brought by the Serious Fraud
Office after Mr Akbar had pleaded guilty to 16 sample charges of false
accounting involving Dollars 745.8m and an additional Pounds 13.6m in the
early 1980s.
Mr Akbar, who has spent more than two years in French and British jails
since his arrest, will be sentenced today.
During the hearing, the court heard that while BCCI set out to hoodwink both
its regulators and auditors, the Bank of England did not apply its standard
test of an individual's fitness to hold their position to Mr Akbar - the
Bank's supervision division considering his post as head of treasury
insufficiently senior to justify such an assessment. It also learnt that Mr
Swaleh Naqvi, now awaiting trial in Abu Dhabi, had made 'sweeping
confessions' about his role in the bank's affairs.
Although the bank grew quickly since its creation in 1972, its weak balance
sheet and poorly performing loans meant that it was effectively insolvent by
1983 and possibly earlier, Mr Langdale said. To survive, it painted an
entirely false picture of its profitability by inflating profits, making
liabilities look like loans, and artificially creating funds.
Top bank officials behaved less like financiers and 'more like a team of
financial jugglers trying to keep an increasing number of balls in the air
in a desperate effort to prevent their ruinous mismanagement being exposed
to the world'. The frauds were sophisticated and the money movements
designed to avoid detection. Carried out in a number of countries, the
frauds were very difficult to detect. The bank's auditors were never given
all relevant information at the same time.
One example of the fraud carried out by Mr Akbar concerned his handling of
funds deposited by the Saudi Sheikh Abdul Khalil. With no authority and
without the Sheikh's knowledge, Mr Akbar created loans against his account.
Mr Akbar then used much of the money to set up Capcom, a commodity dealer
used in BCCI's dealing activities.
About Dollars 60m had been diverted from BCCI to set up the dealing company,
which still exists and deals in foreign exchange, Mr Langdale said.
After leaving BCCI in 1986, Mr Akbar met the Sheikh and told him how his
money had been misused to help conceal the bank's true financial position.
He advised Sheikh Khalil to withdraw his money from the bank, Mr Langdale
said.
Mr Akbar told the Sheikh BCCI's management would kill him if they learnt he
had passed on this information.
After his departure from BCCI, Mr Akbar worked exclusively for Capcom until
his arrest in 1988 for laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking. He was
later sentenced to 18 months in prison. After his release in 1991, Mr Akbar
fled to France. It was only in April 1993 that the SFO was able to extradite
him to the UK.
The cost of the SFO's investigation and preparation of Mr Akbar's case was
Pounds 3,647,599, Mr Langdale said.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Accounts watchdog streamlines inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, is to
streamline its procedures for investigating companies suspected of having
breached accounting standards, it announced yesterday.
The panel will also provide more information to other regulators and
professional bodies on the reasoning behind its decisions, subject to
concerns over confidentiality.
Figures released separately by the panel yesterday show that 117 companies'
accounts have been drawn to its attention since it began operations in 1991.
Mr Edwin Glasgow QC, chairman of the panel, said in a speech yesterday that
the change in its procedures had come in response to comments made during
the past two years of its operations.
He attacked criticisms that the panel had concentrated its disciplinary
efforts on 'minnows', saying that he did not discriminate between small and
large companies.
He said that small investors were right to bring to the panel's attention
'legitimate concerns about companies who have chosen to put themselves on
the public market'.
Mr Glasgow said that litigation had been threatened by the panel against
companies 'on more occasions than might be expected'. Only one such occasion
has been made public, when Trafalgar House first resisted and then
ultimately obeyed the panel's ruling without fighting it in court.
He said the panel did not see its role as making moral judgments but - in a
reference to creative accounting to show figures in the most favourable
light - said: 'We are not complete fools and it often becomes abundantly and
amusingly apparent why a particular 'mistake' has been made.'
The panel is considering 15 cases and has made public statements in respect
of 17 completed investigations. The panel concluded a total of 42 cases
after discussion with the companies concerned.
Some 38 cases were not pursued beyond an initial examination because they
did not fall within the ambit of legislation or because no points of
substance arose. A further 22 were not pursued after some preliminary
consideration.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Successful prosecution in BCCI case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S guilty pleas by Mr Sayed Ali Akbar at the Old Bailey marked the
first successful prosecution of any BCCI official related to the fraud at
the bank since it was closed by the Bank of England more than two years ago,
Richard Donkin writes.
Three outstanding cases in the UK are scheduled to be heard in January. They
involve charges of false accounting against Mr Nazmudin Virani, former
chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi,
former managing director of Attock Oil, and Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Imam, an
assistant to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive.
The SFO has issued three arrest warrants in connection with the cases. They
cover Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a former BCCI depositor now believed to be in
Morocco, Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a senior accounting officer at the bank,
and Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's UK general manager. Mr Haque and Mr Chowdry
are both thought to be in Pakistan.
The SFO investigation is continuing and officers say they expect more
arrests in future. One active part of the inquiry is taking place in the
Cayman Islands in co-operation with the Royal Cayman Island Police.
Warrants have not been issued in the UK against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's
founder, who is now in Pakistan, but an SFO official said yesterday: 'If
Abedi landed at Heathrow he would certainly be arrested.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / SA to begin loan payback next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA is next year to begin repaying international borrowings which
have been frozen since 1985, under an arrangement it has concluded with
creditor banks resolving the debt standstill.
Addressing an investor conference in New York yesterday, Mr Derek Keys,
finance minister, said South Africa would repay, over eight years starting
in January 1994, the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.33bn) that is still affected by
the standstill arrangements. The third interim arrangement between the
government and creditor banks expires at the end of this year.
The agreement should improve the country's credit rating in international
capital markets and assist the negotiation of new loans. It will alleviate
the balance of payments constraint - the need to run a current account
surplus to finance capital outflows of more than Dollars 1bn a year - that
has hampered economic growth over the past eight years.
It also represents a further step in the normalisation of South Africa's
relations with the international financial community following the call on
Friday by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, for
the lifting of remaining economic sanctions against the country.
Politicians around the world have responded quickly to Mr Mandela's call.
The US Senate on Friday approved in record time legislation lifting US
sanctions and Mr David Dinkins, mayor of New York, submitted similar
legislation to the city council. He also said he had sent letters to mayors
across the country requesting them to follow his example.
The European Community and the Commonwealth have also indicated that they
will follow suit.
One notable characteristic of the latest debt agreement is that it was
endorsed by all the main political forces in South Africa. This was in
response to the demands of creditors who said that, unlike the three
previous arrangements which were purely technical affairs, this agreement
required political consensus.
Government officials are anxious to stress that this enhanced co-operation
among South Africa's main political groupings about the country's
international financial relations also extended to its recent revised offer
on trade liberalisation made to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
and to an application for an Dollars 850m loan from the International
Monetary Fund in terms of its compensatory and contingency finance facility.
The main terms of the 1994 debt arrangement are that it will run until
August 15 2001, with an initial payment of 10 per cent (Dollars 500m) and
the balance payable in 15 half-year instalments.
Approximately 40 per cent of the amount of outstanding debt subject to the
standstill arrangement will be repaid during the first five years and the
remaining 60 per cent during the last three years.
The debt standstill arose in September 1985 when South Africa defaulted on
the repayment of Dollars 13.6bn of foreign debt, which was over half of its
total outstanding foreign debt at the time.
The standstill was precipitated by creditor banks, led by Chase Manhattan of
the US, demanding repayment of their loans as apartheid political attitudes
hardened.
South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 17.2bn at the end of 1992, or
15 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 43 per cent when the
standstill was declared.

<TEXT>
MR ANGE-FELIX PATASSE, a veteran politician, has been elected president of
the Central African Republic after years of thwarted efforts and periodic
exile, Reuter reports from Bangui.
Mr Patasse won just over 52 per cent of the vote in the second-round run-off
on September 19. His opponent, Mr Abel Goumba, took 47 per cent. The two,
both contesting the presidency for the third time in the republic's chaotic
history, knocked incumbent President Andre Kolingba out of the race in a
first round on August 22.
Mr Patasse, 56, was prime minister for two months in 1976 during the reign
of Jean-Bedel Bokassa until the despotic ruler dissolved the cabinet and had
himself proclaimed emperor. Mr Patasse went to France, the former colonial
power, returning in 1980 after Bokassa's overthrow in a French-backed coup.
He was beaten in the country's first multi-party elections the next year by
Mr David Dacko, Bokassa's nephew. The losers accused Mr Dacko of rigging the
vote and he responded by banning opposition parties.
Mr Kolingba freed Bokassa from jail on September 1. The former emperor was
accused of cannibalism and infanticide and was serving a 20-year term for
murder and embezzlement.
Bokassa spoke at Bangui's cathedral on Sunday, clad in his ornate marshal's
uniform, and said that like Christ he had been condemned in the name of the
people.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Police open fire on Indian truck strikers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE by Indian lorry drivers, which has disrupted transport for the past
12 days, turned violent yesterday when police opened fire on strikers who
attacked a convoy of fuel tankers.
One man was killed and others injured in the firing, which occurred in the
southern state of Tamil Nadu. The incident will increase the pressure on the
central government to resolve the dispute, which is beginning to cause
serious delays in supplies of fresh food to cities and in industrial
deliveries. However, little progress was reported last night at talks
between Mr Jagdish Tytler, the transport minister, and representatives of
the striking drivers.
The dispute highlights the power of India's organised unions to cause
economic disruption - an important consideration for Indian and foreign
businessmen planning investments.
The strike began after India's constituent states earlier this month raised
the price of an annual permit for crossing a state boundary from Rs1,500 to
Rs5,000 (Pounds 31 to Pounds 104). Every lorry requires a permit for every
boundary crossed, so long-distance operators require several for each lorry.
The rise provoked strong protests from the All India Motor Transport
Congress, the industry's national body, which represents about 800,000
drivers, most of them owners of their own lorries.
The congress claims all its members are on strike though estimates made by
police and other observers put the figure at about 300,000. The precise
figure is difficult to obtain because individual drivers are breaking the
strike by using minor roads and driving by night. There have also been
numerous reports of hauliers bribing strikers to let their vehicles through
checkpoints.
The cumulative effect of the strike has been severe. Vegetable prices in
urban markets have risen 30 to 50 per cent. Some companies have been forced
to suspend production, notably Maruti Udyog, India's leading car maker,
which yesterday laid off its assembly line workers.
Mr Harsh Goenka, president of the Indian Merchants Chamber, said in an
appeal to the government yesterday that the strike was affecting ordinary
people, raising costs and causing unnecessary disruption to industry.
The government has until this week refrained from intervening in the
dispute, arguing it was a matter for drivers and the state administrations
which imposed the permit price rise. Mr Tytler told strikers they must first
call off their action before the states can reconsider their decision. The
strikers said the permit rises should first be withdrawn.

FT  28 SEP 93 / West to urge greater verification: Biological weapons
control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN nations are to press for a strengthening of the international treaty
banning use, production and stockpiling of biological weapons, following the
conclusion of an expert group that measures to check compliance would be
both feasible and useful.
Government experts from 41 countries last week completed a report detailing
21 types of verification procedure, including on-site inspections, which
they say could help guard against cheating. The report now goes to the 134
signatory states to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
European officials said yesterday they hoped to garner support from the
required majority of treaty members to call a special conference within the
next two years which would discuss ways of tightening up the convention.
Some developing countries, notably China, India and Iran, are opposed to
such moves which they fear could be intrusive and compromise military
security.
China and Iran are among five nations - the others being Russia, Syria and
Iraq - thought by the US to possess biological weapons. Other countries
which may have such weapons are Egypt, Taiwan and Libya.
Unlike the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons
Convention, the biological weapons convention contains no policing or
verification measures. This is partly because verification of toxic arms
production was thought to pose insuperable difficulties.
Biological weapons are much harder to detect than nuclear or chemical arms;
they can be easily produced and stored in tiny quantities and the agents and
equipment often have peaceful as well as belligerent uses.
In its report the expert group admits that even in combination there are no
foolproof ways of detecting whether a country has or is trying to acquire
biological weapons.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, the Israeli prime minister, is believed to have held
secret talks with King Hussein in order to allay the Jordanian monarch's
suspicions over Israel's autonomy agreement with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Mr Rabin abruptly cancelled a scheduled address in Jerusalem on Sunday
evening and disappeared for about six hours. Overnight, the Israeli military
censor prevented Israel Radio from broadcasting rumours of a secret meeting.
Mr Rabin's office said yesterday that he had been attending a 'military
exercise' but, pressed further, a spokesman said that even if Mr Rabin had
been meeting King Hussein, none of his officials was going to confirm it.
Although Jordan remains formally in a state of war with Israel, King Hussein
is widely believed to have met frequently, if secretly, every Israeli prime
minister since Mrs Golda Meir more than two decades ago.
While supporting the Israeli-PLO accord, the Jordanian monarch is known to
have been displeased that it was concluded without his involvement and to
have misgivings over the possible implications for his country, home to more
than 1m Palestinian refugees.
The two leaders appeared in separate interviews on the American NBC
television network yesterday, both discussing the possibility of progress on
the Israeli-Syrian front following the Israeli-PLO deal and the agreed
Israel-Jordan 'peace agenda'. King Hussein said he believed Syria's
President Hafez el-Assad was genuinely seeking peace with Israel. Mr Rabin
said he felt the Syrians could be doing more to signal such intent.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is expected to fly to the
Middle East next month, primarily to mediate between Mr Rabin and Mr Assad.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN last night announced a new law introducing the death penalty as the
maximum punishment for drug traffickers. The minimum punishment was also
raised from two years to life imprisonment.
The move came ahead of next Wednesday's national elections. At least eight
tribal elders from the rugged Northern Frontier region have been barred from
the contest amid allegations of their involvement in production and
trafficking of heroin. Islamabad has also stepped up an initiative to
extradite at least 16 drug barons wanted in the US on drug-related charges.
A government announcement after a cabinet meeting in Islamabad, chaired by
Mr Moeen Qureshi, the prime minister, said: 'These enhanced punishments
provide the much needed legal framework to effectively deal with the
narcotics traffickers and their associates who have proliferated drugs in
Pakistan and have seriously eroded Pakistan's prestige abroad.'
The campaign against drug barons is a response to concerns from the US,
Canada and Europe that Pakistan has become an important conduit for heroin
trafficking.
Most heroin leaving Pakistan is produced in the semi-autonomous Northern
Frontier tribal belt, from opium grown in nearby Afghanistan.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12th round of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political future ended
in Beijing yesterday with the two sides as deeply divided as ever.
The two have decided to reconvene on October 12, six days after Hong Kong
governor Mr Chris Patten opens the new session of the colony's Legislative
Council (LegCo), the local 60-seat lawmaking body, whose elections in 1995
are the subject of the talks.
Yesterday's negotiations, and a meeting of foreign ministers scheduled for
Friday, have been made considerably more frosty by the publication last
Friday of Mr Deng Xiaoping's hitherto secret 1982 policy statement on Hong
Kong.
Mr Patten has had to play down its significance. He said Mr Deng's views had
been superseded by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. It was this
agreement that controls Britain's transfer of the colony to China in 1997,
not 'a speech which has been taken out and dusted down', he said.
But the act of publishing Mr Deng's 11-year-old position underlines the
seriousness of the current deadlock in talks about Hong Kong's 1995
elections and represents a hardening of Beijing's position.
Mr Deng's text has become required reading for Beijing's officials involved
with Hong Kong affairs. It was delivered on September 25 1982 in the form of
an opening statement to Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, then Britain's
prime minister, when she met him in Beijing. Britain's purpose was to open
talks on Hong Kong which Mrs Thatcher hoped might result in continuing
British administration of the colony after 1997.
Mr Deng would have none of that. 'On the question of sovereignty, China has
no room to manoeuvre. . . The question is not open to discussion,' he said.
Mr Deng linked the issue of sovereignty to China's experience of colonialism
last century. To concede sovereignty would mean the present Chinese leaders
'were just like Li Hongzhang]' - a reference to an official of the Qing
dynasty whom communist historians hold responsible for China's defeat in the
Sino-Japanese war of 1894.
Mr Deng also made plain that China would run Hong Kong after 1997 and was
prepared in exceptional circumstances to take back the colony earlier.
This was the aspect of his speech highlighted by Chinese officials who
briefed the Hong Kong press last weekend.
The issue of sovereignty is central to the current talks in Beijing
concerning LegCo. Britain wants the last LegCo elections held on its watch -
those in 1995 - to be transparent and, in Mr Patten's words, 'clean'. China,
on the other hand, wants to control the outcome as much as it can.
For example, Britain wants members of the electoral college who choose 10 of
LegCo's members to be elected themselves. China wants the college. to be
appointed. It also wants 12 candidates to be selected from the membership of
the college and then for the whole college to choose 10.
This fundamental difference in objective - Britain concerned with process,
China with outcome - will be difficult to reconcile.
When Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, meets Mr Qian Qichen, his
Chinese counterpart, in New York later this week he is likely to tell Mr
Qian that unless China accepts it cannot predetermine the outcome of the
election there is little use in the two sides continuing their talks. How
China would react is unclear.
In Hong Kong the prospect of a collapse in the talks is greeted with
disquiet bordering on alarm.
As Mr Allen Lee, leader of the conservative Liberal party, wrote in the
weekend press: 'The people of Hong Kong want the talks to continue and to
succeed; for unless Britain and China co-operate, the alternative for us can
only be grim.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN cabinet ministers are to form a special 'ministerial strategy'
committee to help guide the federal government's contentious budget
legislation through parliament.
Six weeks since the budget package was unveiled, the government still lacks
the support needed to ensure its proposed measures pass in the Senate. Last
week, it was obliged to split the original, single budget bill into eight
separate bills, because of fears that the 'omnibus' approach could be
declared unconstitutional.
Yesterday's decision to set up a special committee to oversee the bills'
passage through the Senate followed the first cabinet meeting since Prime
Minister Paul Keating returned from a two-week overseas trip at the weekend.
The committee's aim is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to negotiations
with the two minority parties, the Greens and the Australian Democrats,
which hold the balance of power in the Senate. The committee will be chaired
by whichever minister is responsible for the particular budget bill under
consideration.
When parliament reconvened yesterday after its two-week break Mr John
Dawkins, the treasurer, came under further attack from the opposition over
the budget debacle. Mr Dawkins retorted that the opposition was behaving
irresponsibly and should 'do the decent and proper thing' by passing the
bills. The bills were due to be debated in the House of Representatives last
night and could be back in the Senate today.
Strike action by Australia's notoriously militant waterfront unions over job
cuts was estimated to have left about 46 ships in limbo yesterday.
The dispute centres on plans by Australian Stevedores to axe 317 jobs, as
part of a cost-cutting plan. The unions, opposed to the move, began
industrial action last week, and then called a full-scale stoppage over the
weekend.
Arbitration began yesterday, but Mr Jim Sweetenson, managing director of
Australian Stevedores, estimated that 24 ships were already marooned
alongside wharves and 22 more were waiting to enter the country's ports.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Keidanren calls for tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Keidanren, Japan's top business federation, stepped up pressure for tax
cuts after government hints over the weekend that reductions were possible.
'During these tough economic times, we need to have a drastic income tax
cut, along with an easing of corporate tax,' said Mr Hiroshi Saito,
Keidanren vice chairman and chairman of Nippon Steel.
A day earlier Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, told a press conference
in Washington that 'expectations. . . for tax cuts will not be betrayed'.
Tax reform is being studied by a government panel, which is considering
proposing a cut in income tax, to be financed by a subsequent rise in
consumption tax. The panel is due to report in time for the government to
decide on any changes before the end of the current tax year to March.
It is a politically divisive question for the seven-party coalition
government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa because the largest coalition partner,
the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, is
unwilling to accept a rise in consumption tax, which is likely to harm
poorer voters.
Senior Keidanren members also urged the government yesterday to consider
setting a rough, but not binding, target for the reduction of Japan's record
current account surplus, a serious irritant to relations with its main trade
partners.
'It is important to show clearly Japan's strong intention to cut the
surplus,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, the car maker. The
continuing dispute with the US over this is seen as a factor in the rise of
the yen, which has hit Japanese exporters' profits.
Mr Toyoda opposed US demands for a numerically targeted cut in the trade
surplus, but said Japan should set its own medium- to long-term target for
reducing the surplus, not to be seen as a promise.
Japanese crude steel output is set to fall by an annualised 3.7 per cent in
the final quarter of the calendar year, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry forecast yesterday. This will represent a 1.9 per cent decline
from the current three-month period, and be the first drop in four quarters.

CHINA executed eight young financial workers yesterday in what officials
called the biggest cases of public embezzlement since the 1949 communist
revolution, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The country also announced the arrest of a Chinese reporter from a Hong Kong
newspaper on charges of 'espionage regarding state secrets on banking'.
An unspecified number of alleged conspirators were arrested in the case
involving Mr Xi Yang of Ming Pao daily, the Xinhua news agency said. A Ming
Pao editor in Hong Kong called for Mr Xi's release.
High publicity surrounding the executions and the apparently unrelated
arrests indicated they were part of top-level campaigns to bring order to
the chaotic and primitive financial sector and to crack down on corruption.
Mr Jiang Zemin, Communist party chief, recently targeted corruption as a
'virus' that if not checked could destroy Chinese socialism.
The People's Supreme Court rejected appeals from the financial workers,
mostly accountants in their 20s and 30s and including one woman, and ordered
them executed.
'These people lusted for profits, were very bold and ran wild,' Mr Liu
Jiachen, court vice-president, was quoted by state radio as saying.
He called their bounty 'extraordinarily large. They took advantage of the
poor management of their banks,' he said. The largest case involved theft of
Yn33m (Pounds 3.7m) by five defendants.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE prosecutors last night arrested another leading provincial
politician as their investigation into a network of alleged bribery by
construction companies gathered momentum.
Mr Shuntaro Honma, 53, governor of Miyagi prefecture, north of Tokyo, was
arrested for allegedly receiving Y20m (Pounds 125,000), while prosecutors
also took into custody an official of the Liberal Democratic party and two
executives of Taisei, a large contractor based in Tokyo.
The move by prosecutors followed the arrest last week of Mr Teruzo Yoshino,
patriarch of Japan's construction industry and chairman of Shimizu, the
largest contractor, for allegedly bribing a different provincial governor.
Prosecutors are expected to target national politicians in the next few
weeks, and the investigation could be embarrassing for members and former
members of the LDP, which has traditionally had close ties to the
construction industry.
In the Miyagi case, Mr Honma, a former journalist, is alleged to have
received money from the two Taisei officials in January this year in
connection with contracts to build a medical complex and a sports stadium in
the prefecture.
In the past three months, 22 provincial government officials and
construction company executives have been arrested, providing evidence for
US trade negotiators, who are demanding that the Japanese government reform
bidding procedures for public works con-tracts.
At present, only designated companies are allowed to bid, but it is often
unclear why certain companies have been designated and others excluded from
a contract. The US wants open bidding for all public works projects.

Negotiators are eager to push Uruguay Round to the fore

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO top trade officials of the EC and US yesterday made substantive
progress in bilateral talks on the Uruguay Round, but continued to disagree
on the farm trade question.
At a packed press conference in Washington, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Mickey
Kantor seemed determined to push the Round forward and their dispute over
farm trade to the side. There were only 79 days until December 15, the Gatt
deadline, they said, and urged the world to get back to business in Geneva
to put offers on the table.
'There simply is no time to waste,' said Sir Leon.
They then announced that bilateral talks would continue this week on steel,
aircraft, aluminium and textiles, and that they would meet again in Brussels
on October 13.
Under orders from the EC, Sir Leon, the EC commissioner in charge of trade,
had dutifully and 'forcefully' presented suggestions for 'interpretations,
clarifications, amplifications or additions' to last year's US-EC Blair
House accord on farm trade.
'I responded with equal force that we would not reopen or renegotiate Blair
House,' said Mr Kantor, the US trade representative.
Sir Leon said Mr Kantor needed time to consider his suggestions. Mr Kantor
said the ball was not in his court.
As one official close to the negotiations noted, although Mr Kantor is
showing no flexibility he has a right to believe that a deal signed is a
deal done.
Mr Kantor is under pressure from farm groups and their supporters in
Congress, where he has vowed to be tougher than his predecessors, who often
swapped trade concessions for the sale of cold war solidarity. With the
North American Free Trade Agreement in trouble in Congress it is no time to
be seen buckling under EC pressure.
The pressure could increase later this week, however. Mr Alain Juppe, the
French foreign minister, announced yesterday he was to meet Mr Kantor in
Washington on Friday.
Meanwhile, another key player in Washington yesterday, Mr Peter Sutherland,
director-general of Gatt, pointed out that the farm trade debate was 'not
merely across the Atlantic'. Many Latin American countries have yet to
accept the Blair House deal.
He has called a meeting of top negotiators in the Uruguay Round for next
Thursday. The 116-nation trade negotiations committee is intended to keep up
the pressure on negotiators to come forward with better offers in bilateral
talks, under way in Geneva, on improving market access for imported goods
and services.
These negotiations will have to be largely completed within the next four to
six weeks to meet the Round's December deadline.
Negotiations on services are said to be proceeding well and are putting the
finishing touches to the draft general agreement on trade in services, which
provides a framework of rules for the continued liberalisation of services
trade. The revised draft is due to be presented to negotiators on Friday.
But negotiations on goods remain stuck in areas such as agricultural
products and textiles, where leading traders have allegedly failed to make
adequate offers.
Countries are also hoping to complete talks on revised codes of practice for
government procurement and civil aircraft by mid-December, to coincide with
the Round's deadline.

<TEXT>
TOYOTA, Japan's largest carmaker, is to build a Y2.5bn (Pounds 15.7m) engine
plant in Canada next spring, to raise the local content of cars assembled
there, write William Dawkins in Tokyo and Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, due to take effect next year,
duties will be charged on cars assembled from imported components. The aim
of the new plant was to avoid such duties, company officials said.
Toyota's Canadian subsidiary currently imports 1.6 and 1.8 litre engines
from Japan for use in Corolla models made at its assembly line near
Cambridge, in south-west Ontario. The new engine factory will be close to
the car plant.
The move also forms part of Toyota's strategy of increasing production
outside Japan to reduce the damage to price competitiveness inflicted by the
yen's long-term rise. Foreign output, which was 5.8 per cent of the total in
1988, rose to 16.3 per cent last year and is estimated to hit 19 per cent
this year.
Toyota has even started to import foreign-made parts for use in its
Japanese-manufactured cars. Engines and engine components were imported from
the US last year, followed by crankshafts and cylinder blocks from Britain
this month.
The Canadian plant, due to open in late 1995, will make 80,000 engines a
year, which almost matches the current production of cars.

FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Typhoons may force Tokyo to import rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is under increasing pressure to import rice to counter an expected
shortfall in this year's crop, which has been severely damaged by a spate of
typhoons and an unusually cold summer.
The Agriculture Ministry yesterday denied Japanese newspaper reports that it
has already decided on limited imports, but officials have admitted the
annual rice harvest index, due to be announced on Thursday, will show a
sharp fall in production.
Imports will be an embarrassment for the Japanese government, which has
resisted international pressure for the rice market to be opened as part of
a settlement under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks.
There was a suggestion from within the government yesterday that emergency
imports could be used to signify the opening of the market, although Tokyo's
negotiating position has been that a decision on the rice market is
impossible until the US and EC reach agreement on farm trade. It is more
likely that imports would be characterised as a once-only response to the
shortfall.
One Japanese negotiator explained that differences between the US and EC
made a rice market opening difficult to justify to politically influential
Japanese farmers.
Japan relaxed its ban on imports in 1984, when 150,000 tonnes of rice were
imported from South Korea, and rice was imported in the harsh years
immediately after the second world war.
The rice harvest index for August was 95, against the 100 of an average
year, but it is widely expected the index for September will slip to about
85.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has indicated he will be more
flexible on the issue than his predecessors. However, the largest group in
Mr Hosokawa's coalition government, the Social Democratic party, formerly
the Japan Socialist party, is strongly opposed to rice imports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN attempt to put pressure on trade negotiators, the heads of the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Gatt yesterday urged immediate
action to conclude the Uruguay Round.
Appearing together, Mr Michel Camdessus, Mr Lewis Preston and Mr Peter
Sutherland warned that failure to conclude the Round would unleash a cycle
of greater protectionism and loss of confidence which would destroy jobs and
put at risk the new democracies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
However, while full of dire warnings, the unprecedented joint statement from
the three did not single out any country or group as causing the current
impasse in the trade talks.
But Mr Sutherland said later that the main responsibility for bringing the
talks to a conclusion lay with the European Community and the US.
Despite a weekend of meetings in which the majority of finance ministers and
senior officials representing the IMF's 178 member countries supported free
trade, Mr Sutherland admitted yesterday morning that there was nothing
specific in the discussions to suggest countries were prepared to change
bargaining positions.

FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: A Japanese lure for US carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the Japanese carmaker, announced during the summer that it would be
working with Ford of the US, a competitor, on the development of cruise
control systems for use in their cars.
The trans-Pacific tie-up is a first for both companies. If US trade
negotiators have their way, there will be more cases of co-operation in
developing components between US and Japanese carmakers.
Car components, like the cruise control system Ford and Toyota will be
working on, are the target of a drive by the US to reduce its trade deficit
with Japan by pressing the Japanese to open specific sectors to more US-made
products.
Last week negotiators from the two countries met in Hawaii to discuss
bilateral trade in car and car parts for the first time under a new
framework for talks aimed at improving the balance of trade between the US
and Japan.
The US in particular is keen to see Japan buy more car parts from US
manufacturers since motor vehicle products last year made up 63 per cent of
the Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32.4bn) US trade deficit with Japan, according to
the US Department of Commerce.
After a surprise show of enthusiasm by the Japanese car industry, which last
year indicated its willingness to buy Y19bn (Pounds 116.5m) worth of US-made
car parts in fiscal 1994, there are moves among US officials to try to set a
similar target for 1995 and 1996.
Their efforts are being supported by a growing interest among US car parts
makers in the Japanese market. General Motors, for example, has set up a
technical centre on the outskirts of Tokyo.
Although it has lagged behind GM, Ford is also beginning to extend its
Japanese customer base beyond traditional business partners such as Mazda in
which it has a 25 per cent stake. It is building a development centre
outside Tokyo - its second in Japan - where it will develop components to
supply all Japanese car makers.
US companies are also becoming interested in Japan as a stepping stone into
the Asian market.
Their greater interest in the Japanese market has even encouraged US
components makers to adapt their business practices in Japan to the Japanese
way. GM, for example, has joined a number of suppliers' associations - a
group of preferred suppliers which work together to serve a customer and
which have been criticised by the US as a symbol of Japanese industry's
exclusive business practices.
In public, the Japanese vehicle industry welcomes such moves by its US
competitors. 'GM and Ford's presence in Japan has made a huge difference in
terms of communication,' says Mr Hisashi Kamoshida, a manager in Toyota's
purchasing planning division. But officials at Japanese carmakers are at
pains to stress it will take time to correct the imbalance in bilateral car
components trade.
For one thing there is a structural reason for that imbalance - the small
number of US cars sold in Japan means there is little demand for replacement
parts.
The absence of US car manufacturing in Japan also means demand for US
components is low whereas Japanese components are in demand from Japanese
carmakers which have set up facilities in the US.
It also takes at least four years to develop components for a new car. In
that respect, the Japanese say they are doing what they can to improve the
chances of US suppliers. 'As far as car parts go we have made efforts that
go beyond normal business transactions,' says Mr Hiroyoshi Ono, deputy
general manager of international public affairs at Toyota. They have held
seminars for US suppliers on 'design-ins' whereby they work with their
suppliers to develop parts for a specific car.
Although the US argues that the yen's appreciation has made US car
components more cost-competitive, Japanese car companies point out that cost
is not the sole determining factor. Quality, development ability, delivery
time and after-sales services are also crucial.
'We can't buy a component just because it's cheap,' says Mr Masatomo
Okahara, deputy general manager of Nissan's international purchasing
department.
US suppliers must show that they can keep up with the development pace of
Japanese car makers and quickly adapt their products to the many changes
made during the development of a car, something which Japanese suppliers do
well.
'We are willing to buy from US suppliers if they meet our needs,' says Mr
Ono. 'But there aren't that many US parts makers that are willing to take
the risk to sell to us.'
If GM and Ford's moves in Japan are an indication of a trend, however,
Japanese carmakers could find that reversed sooner than expected.

ROVER GROUP, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is
negotiating with the Sipani group of India for assembly of its Montego large
family car in India.
Rover said yesterday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Sipani
and was 'actively discussing' a joint venture agreement which could include
assembly of both the Montego and Rover's two litre turbo-diesel engine.
The diesel engine would be assembled by Auto Tractors, a subsidiary of the
Sipani group.
Rover said talks were still at an early stage. Its engagement in the project
would be mainly technical rather than financial, and it was not aiming to
take a significant equity stake.
If a deal were agreed it is expected that assembly would begin from
semi-knocked-down kits supplied from Rover's plant at Cowley, Oxford. At a
later stage assembly would move to completely-knocked-down kits, and the
joint venture would seek to increase gradually the volume of locally
purchased components.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH just over two months to go to Venezuela's presidential elections, Mr
Rafael Caldera, 77, a former president with an ambivalent stance on the
country's continuing free-market reforms, has emerged as the leading
candidate.
Mr Caldera, who founded the Christian Democrat (Copei) party in the 1940s,
is one of Venezuela's most prominent politicians. An expert in labour
legislation and a member of Congress for much of his life, he served as
president from 1969 to 1974 and first ran for the presidency in 1947. For
the current presidential campaign, his sixth, Mr Caldera broke with his
party and is now running as an independent.
Much of his campaign has been based on attacking the free-market reforms
initiated in 1989 by ex-President Carlos Andres Perez, who was forced out of
office this year because of corruption charges. But Mr Caldera and his
advisers have tried recently to convince businessmen and investors that they
back private investment and will not return to excessive government
intervention in the economy.
His adversaries, though, accuse Mr Caldera and his team of saying one thing
in Venezuela and quite another to audiences overseas.
The ex-president, until now a strong anti-communist, has accepted a wide
range of support from more than a dozen smaller political parties, including
the Communist party of Venezuela and other leftist groups. Many of these
enthusiastic supporters of today used to consider Mr Caldera one of the
country's worst reactionaries.
Mr Caldera's strategy of breaking with his former party could possibly pay
dividends. More than ever before, Venezuelans are rejecting the two
political parties that have dominated national politics since the last
military dictator was ousted in 1958. Democratic Action (AD) has captured
the presidency in five out of the seven democratic elections held over the
last 35 years, and Copei has won twice.
Mr Caldera is one of four leading candidates from a pack of 17 contenders,
which includes a spiritualist, a sexologist, a former guerrilla and two
retired military officers.
Second in the polls and representing Copei is Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, 50, a
longtime congressman and twice-elected governor of Zulia state. After
winning a stunning primary victory last April, Mr Alvarez declared he was in
favour of continuing free-market reforms, but added he would seek a wide
political consensus and more effective social welfare programmes.
Mr Andres Velasquez, 40, is a labour organiser who turned to national
politics and was elected twice as governor of Bolivar state. For the third
time, he is standing as presidential candidate for Causa Radical, a small
left-wing party. He has called for a 'peaceful revolution' in Venezuela, and
has proposed a broad mix of reforms.
Representing AD is Mr Claudio Fermin, 43, ex-mayor of Caracas and a
sociologist who has been a party activist since he was 15. Mr Fermin is also
convinced Venezuela must push ahead with economic and political reforms, but
seeks a greater share of social justice for those hardest hit by economic
change.
A national poll in August showed Mr Caldera had 24.8 per cent support: Mr
Alvarez (whose position eroded sharply in comparison with surveys in May and
June) 15.4 per cent; Mr Velasquez 13.4 per cent; and a humiliating 9.8 per
cent for Mr Fermin.

<TEXT>
VIETNAM yesterday jumped its final hurdle before being reinstated into the
international financial community when donor nations completed negotiations
for clearing up the country's Dollars 140m (Pounds 91m) arrears to the
International Monetary fund.
Nine governments led by France and Japan agreed to provide Dollars 55m in
grants to wipe out part of the arrears. A group of banks led by the Banque
Francaise du Commerce Exterieure and the Japanese Eximbank will then provide
a syndicated bridging loan of Dollars 85m.
Once Vietnam is back in good standing, the IMF board is expected to agree
next Wednesday to an Dollars 85m credit under its standby arrangements,
which will repay the bridge loan. The arrangements will also pave the way
for Vietnam to receive financing from the World Bank.
Mr Christian Noyer, director of the French Treasury and co-chairman of
yesterday's meetings in Washington, said Vietnam would also qualify for a
Dollars 20m drawing under the IMF's new Systemic Transformation Facility, a
special loan fund set up to help centrally planned economies such as Russia
make the shift to a market economy.
A similar meeting is planned for today which could arrange for Cambodia to
erase its Dollars 55m arrears to the IMF.
Donor countries are expected to meet in Paris on November 9-10 to work out
aid to help finance Vietnam's balance of payments shortfall over the next
two years.
Mr Noyer said the Paris Club of creditor nations would probably also meet in
November to discuss rescheduling Vietnam's official debt.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UK 'unlikely' to raise developing country lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday
signalled that the UK would probably refuse to add to the pool of
concessional lending for the poorest developing countries that is managed by
the International Monetary Fund.
Citing the squeeze on public spending in the UK, he said Britain was
'unlikely' to contribute to an extension of the IMF's enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF), which provides loans at interest rates of only
0.5 per cent to developing countries carrying out market based reforms.
The creation of a proposed SDR 5bn (Pounds 4.66bn) successor to ESAF, which
expires at the end of November, has been one of the main IMF-related issues
under discussion at this year's IMF and World Bank annual meetings in
Washington.
While IMF member countries have achieved a consensus on the desirability of
a new facility, its financing remains in doubt.
The ESAF has been able to provide loans with subsidised interest rates with
the help of donations from countries such as Britain, which has been a big
contributor. Although Mr Clarke made a final British decision on ESAF
contingent on discussions in the public spending round, he made clear he
would prefer the IMF itself to provide the cash through such means as the
sale of some of its gold holdings.
He also repeated his call for other industrialised nations to support UK
demands for increased debt relief for the poorest developing nations under
the so-called Trinidad terms.
Mr Clarke said the idea was gaining support and singled out Japan as
'virtually isolated' in resisting UK calls to grant immediate debt relief
and raise the rate of debt relief to two-thirds or even 80 per cent in some
cases from 50 per cent at present.
In his speech to the IMF-World Bank Development Committee yesterday Mr
Clarke said energetic action on debt would make a radical difference to the
prospects of many of the poorest countries in the world.
This would be 'at no practical cost to the creditor countries, who will
never see these old debts repaid in any event.'
Mr Clarke insisted that aid should be directed to countries with sensible
economic and social policies and 'where there is a clear political
commitment to a market economy and a free society'.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Texas senator indicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEXAS grand jury has indicted newly elected Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison
on charges of using her former office as state treasurer for political and
personal ends.
Mrs Hutchison, a Republican, won a sweeping victory in a June by-election to
fill the Senate seat vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen's move to become Treasury
secretary, thrashing Mr Bob Krueger, who had been appointed to serve as
interim senator, by a 67 per cent to 33 per cent margin.
The district attorney of Travis County, in Texas, said the grand jury had
indicted Mrs Hutchison on two charges of misusing public property and
workers while she was state treasurer, and two of tampering with government
records and physical evidence.
Two former state treasury officials were also charged.
In a statement issued in Washington Mrs Hutchison said the allegations were
'false and unfair'.
'Today's announcement by the Democratic district attorney of Travis County
is merely another chapter in the sleazy campaign tactics employed by
Democrats during the US Senate campaign this year,' she said.
Mr Ronnie Earle, the district attorney, said Mrs Hutchison's claims that his
office was leading a partisan attack was a standard rebuttal from a public
official under investigation.
'Every one of them says it's political, whether they are Democrats or
Republicans,' he said. His investigation began just five days after Mrs
Hutchison's by-election victory.
Despite having won election only this year, Mrs Hutchison must defend her
seat again next November, when Mr Bentsen's original six-year term comes up
for renewal.
Neither indictment nor even conviction entails expulsion from the US Senate.

a permanent seat for Japan in the Security Council, an issue that has
sharply divided his coalition government.
He said that there was a need to expand the Council membership beyond the
present 15 states and it was important to engage 'those countries having
both the will and the adequate capacity to contribute to world prosperity
and stability in that effort.' However, its effectiveness must be
maintained, he said in an address to the UN General Assembly.
Japanese personnel had already joined UN peacekeeping operations in
Cambodia, Mozambique and Angola, he said, and Tokyo intended to continue
this policy.
Echoing remarks by US President Bill Clinton, he called for 'serious reform
efforts' to enable the UN to respond fully to expectations of the
international community.
Mr Hosokawa took the opportunity of his first visit to the UN to voice
Japan's 'sense of remorse over its past actions' - an allusion to the second
world war.
He announced a Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) aid package over two years for the
Palestinians, including food and medicine grants, and concessional loans for
infrastructure.
Later, Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa discussed US-Japanese relations, and in
particular the large US-Japanese trade deficit.
But if the US president had hoped for any precise Japanese commitment for
the reduction of this deficit, he was disappointed.
At a joint press conference afterwards, Mr Clinton emphasised that the
bilateral economic relationship between the US was the most important in the
world, and added: 'We must make progress on our bilateral trade.'
For his part, Mr Hosokawa said only that 'Japan will do its best' in the
framework of the economic policy adopted in July, 'so that favourable
results will emerge as soon as possible'.
Even if he was disappointed, Mr Clinton nevertheless said: 'I was heartened
by our meeting. Mr Hosokawa has a mandate for change, and I think that means
we can work together'.
In an interview televised earlier, Mr Hosokawa said Japan should not go out
of its way to seek a Security Council seat.
'I believe it is necessary for Japan to let things take their course, and if
(Japan is) asked to be a permanent member, then (it would) become a
permanent member,' he said.
'But I don't think Japan should go out of its way to make a campaign to
become a member.'

FT  28 SEP 93 / Deadline looms on spending bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US Congress is likely to have to resort to its habitual stop-gap
measures to keep the government running, after again failing to meet the
September 30 deadline for passing new spending bills.
Without new legislation, federal departments will run out of money when the
US fiscal year ends at midnight on Thursday.
Only one of the 13 spending bills, providing for Congress' own funding, has
been passed, and congressional leaders expect they will have to resort to a
'continuing resolution' providing for spending allocations from 1993 to be
rolled forward for two weeks.
Continuing resolutions are a recurrent tool of Congress, but they always
create a degree of nervousness because they must pass if the government is
not to grind to a halt, and members sometimes try to exploit them by
attaching other measures.
Some spending bills have already passed both chambers of Congress and bills
covering the agriculture and treasury departments, and perhaps also foreign
aid, could pass before Thursday night's deadline.
Delays are expected for the Dollars 240bn (Pounds 156bn) defence
appropriations bill, the only one which has not yet passed the House. It has
been held up as members were reluctant to vote for big military spending
programmes before the Pentagon's own 'bottom up review'.
The transport department's Dollars 13bn spending bill also faces delays and
the interior department bill could be held hostage in the battle by western
senators to block administration efforts to reform the running of federal
lands and raise fees charged to ranchers who rent grazing from the
government.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Fujimori gets in way of his reform message: The
authoritarian style of Peru's president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru is on the campaign trail. Three years
into his five-year term, Mr Fujimori has been criss-crossing the country
seeking support for a new constitution to be put to a national referendum on
October 31.
A recent visit to Juliaca, a town high in the Andes near Lake Titicaca, is
typical of his campaigning style. He opened a road, gave away computers to a
school, donated incubators to the hospital. He and his aides frantically
distributed hundreds of calendars carrying his picture.
The new constitution is seeking to legitimise Mr Fujimori's usurping of the
1979 constitution in April last year, when he dissolved congress. In an
interview in Lima, he described its aim as a 'fundamental reform, without
which we would continue to suffer political instability'.
It was 'seeking a more efficient congress and a judiciary less dependent on
political party interests, less subject to manipulation and corruption'.
Furthermore, his government's economic reforms - in particular, its radical
privatisation programme now apparently moving ahead in earnest - would be
legitimised by the referendum.
It also includes controversial proposals for the re-introduction of the
death penalty - and to allow the election of a president for a second
consecutive term.
Mr Fujimori denies that he is much concerned with re-election: 'I've no
ambition at all to follow this with another period in office. I don't have
this obsession. What interests me is to put in place the steps for
development and to consolidate all the reforms that have been made. This
consolidation will take place in the period until 1995.' Many Peruvians are
sceptical.
His speeches to his Andean Indian audience in Juliaca echoed his successful
1990 presidential campaign, which allowed him to come from nowhere to
victory in little over three weeks. Mr Fujimori, whose parents emigrated
from Japan, contrasted himself to 'traditional politicians' who spent their
time 'drinking little whiskies at little cocktail parties in Lima'.
Mr Fujimori defies easy pigeon-holing. He is defined more by what he is not
 -a member of the narrow Spanish-descended elite in the capital - than by
what he is. He has pushed through aspects of an orthodox economic policy and
is backing privatisation, but he is no liberal: the way he distributes gifts
in places such as Juliaca preserves the illusion of the the state as the
ultimate source of wealth in the country.
Mr Fujimori's apparent personal austerity and his solitary image stand in
contrast to the despised traditional politicians with their reputations for
high living and corruption. His popularity is based on the fact that he is
credited with taming, for now at least, Peru's two main sources of
instability during the 1980s - terrorism and hyperinflation.
Yet, some in Lima believe Mr Fujimori is less of a break with the past than
he makes out. Mr Hernando de Soto, the Lima-based economist and
entrepreneur, says the president is right to criticise Peru's political
party leadership for being out of touch with ordinary Peruvians.
Yet he adds: 'Despite his critical rhetoric of the traditional parties,
Fujimori is essentially a continuation of the past.'
The worry he and others have is centred on the authoritarian style of Mr
Fujimori's government. Mr Fujimori has centralised power since he took
office, so that even the previous rudimentary checks on executive power have
been reduced. His suspension of the constitution on April 5 1992 underlined
a lack of interest in the rule of law.
The president does not deny that he wields power in a highly personalised
way: 'I think most people want a strong executive power which exercises its
mandate to the full, that uses all its faculties to achieve important
objectives. Here there is a chairman of the board or a general manager who
controls, supervises, prosecutes and tries to ensure things go well.'
Mr Fujimori has also given the impression that he is not too keen on
competition: those who are in danger of becoming too prominent or popular
are moved aside. The economy minister for 23 months, Mr Carlos Bolona, was
sacked at the start of the year.
Mr Ketin Vidal, the man who captured Abimael Guzman - who as the head of the
Maoist guerrilla group, Shining Path, was Peru's most wanted man  - and is
the nearest thing Peru has to a national hero, has been kicked upstairs to a
less prominent position.
Mr Fujimori, who is due to address the UN General Assembly in New York on
Friday, emphasises the 'pragmatism' of his government, which worries those
who believe his commitment to economic reform will remain only as long as he
is popular. But he denies that his pragmatism means he only seeks short-term
solutions.
Mr Bolona says: 'Fujimori, like most politicians, likes to appropriate the
windfalls - such as the capture of Guzman and the improvement in the economy
 -for himself. Having said that we must acknowledge that he has had the will
to make and carry through on decisions.'
Most opinion polls - often not very reliable in Peru - predict a majority
will favour the proposed constitution; Mr Fujimori will be severely weakened
if it does not. But what the president really needs is a ringing
endorsement.
A narrow majority will do little to help him and may unsettle foreign
investors, who generally favour most of the proposed constitution's economic
provisions. Without a big majority, the risk is that the new charter would
be seen as the Fujimori constitution, with a shelf life only as long as his
term of office.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Investor holds Dollars 1bn in Brazil debt: Private stake
held by Dart family of US complicates restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US private investor has become one of Brazil's biggest commercial
creditors and is complicating the restructuring of Dollars 40bn (Pounds
25.9bn) of debt, according to bankers close to negotiations between the
Brazilian government and banks.
It is the first time a private investor has had a significant impact in a
big bank debt restructuring, although banks began to sell their Latin
American loans to private investors in the mid-1980s.
According to bankers, a stake of close to Dollars 1bn face value has been
built by interests belonging to Mr Kenneth Dart, president of Dart
Containers, and the Dart family, which made its fortune from the invention
in 1960 of the polystyrene cup. This stake, bought at significant discount
to face value, would make the family one of the top five holders of
Brazilian bank debt.
Brazil offered holders of its bank debt a choice of six options in the
restructuring, but reserved the right to alter the final balance between
options.
A majority of debt holders opted for a so-called 'par' bond, which is most
expensive from the government's point of view. The government wanted to
reduce the share of par bonds to 40 per cent of total debt.
Most big banks agreed to adjust their choices but the Dart family was
unwilling to do so, the bankers said. Representatives from the family were
not immediately available for comment.
Brazil's leading bank creditors, headed by Citibank of the US, and Brazilian
officials have met representatives of the family to persuade them to adjust
their choices, but appear to have failed.
Notwithstanding this, bankers in Washington yesterday said the government
and its leading bank creditors had decided to move ahead with the
documentation and signing of the restructuring agreement. The documentation
will be put before the Brazilian Senate for approval in early October.
Brazilian officials said the plan was to begin signing the agreement by
early October and complete it by the end of November. The deal would be
closed by the end of February on the agreement of a standby loan accord
between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund. This agreement would let
the US Treasury issue bonds to Brazil to act as collateral in the deal.
However, it is possible some banks will protest at large investors
'cheap-riding' by being allowed to choose a more favourable option than most
of the banks. 'The problem is that this is an entity that is not sensitive
to the usual concerns of central bankers and the regulators,' said one US
banker.
The development has led bankers to question whether the mostly co-operative
approach to bank debt rescheduling can continue with an ever-larger
proportion of the debt held by individual investors. A number of lawsuits,
designed to force payments from debtor governments, have been filed by
non-bank investors over last year.

THE growing importance of environmental issues in developing nations was
underscored yesterday by the disclosure that the World Bank nearly doubled
its lending for environmental protection to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in
its business year to the end of June.
In its fourth annual report covering its environmental activities, the bank
said it approved loans of Dollars 1.3bn for pollution control and the
protection of the urban environment, Dollars 521m for natural resources
management and Dollars 173m to help build up institutions to protect the
environment in developing nations.
The 23 projects approved last year represented a 30-fold increase in the
value of bank lending for the environment compared with five years ago.
The Bank's so-called 'brown agenda', covering pollution control and urban
projects, included large projects for the control of water pollution in
Brazil, China, South Korea and Turkey and air pollution control projects in
India and Mexico.
Lending for natural resources and the rural environment (the Bank's 'green
agenda') included projects for water resource and land conservation and
management in Egypt, India, Pakistan and Turkey and for natural habitat
protection in Egypt, Gabon, the Seychelles, Tunisia and Venezuela.
The Bank's report makes clear that its rapid advance in a new area of
activity is not without risk.
While studies so far suggest that the performance of its environmental
projects is about the same as or slightly better than the bank's overall
portfolio, the report noted that most of the projects are still young.
'It is clear that strong efforts will be required to ensure the portfolio of
environmental projects performs well,' it said.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Delors to call for pact on new jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, is expected to
call today for a European-wide social pact between business and trade unions
to bolster the EC's faltering competitiveness.
Mr Delors will outline at a Brussels summit between European employers and
trade unions his ideas on how to reconcile the EC's urgent need to improve
job creation while preserving the welfare state
The European Social Dialogue summit is viewed as an important step towards
achieving a consensus on how to improve Europe's disappointing job creation
record in relation to the US and Japan.
But Mr Delors' call for a European-wide social pact may unleash criticism
from the UK, which views with suspicion initiatives emanating from the
European Commission and is intent on putting forward a 'British model' based
on wage flexibility and labour market deregulation.
Attitudes in London may harden as a result of remarks by Mr Delors to the
EC's economic and social committee yesterday. Mr Delors said only a federal
Europe could meet challenges such as the wars in former Yugoslavia and
unemployment - reviving the controversy leading up to the signing of the
Maastricht treaty in December 1991.
Mr Delors later told Reuters that the speech was his response to Mr John
Major's article in the Economist last week calling for the Community to stop
edging towards greater centralisation.
European trade union officials said yesterday that Mr Delors' notion of a
European social pact - while still in outline - was likely to draw on ideas
for improving job creation either agreed or under discussion among member
states on the Continent.
Mr Delors is said to admire the efforts to reach a political consensus in
Italy, particularly over scrapping the scala mobile wage indexation system.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the UK's Trades Union Congress, said he
was willing to discuss the possibility of EC-wide 'framework agreements'
between employers and trade unions on issues such as employment, training,
works councils and working time. 'Maybe there could be some trade-offs,' he
said.
He rejected suggestions that pan-European initiatives emanating from
Brussels were outdated and clashed with the Maastricht treaty's emphasis on
subsidiarity - the devolution of decision-making to the lowest possible
national, regional or local level.
The disagreement between Mr Major and Mr Delors indicates that a planned
October 29 summit intended to relaunch the EC is certain to feature old,
abiding divisions.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC GOVERNMENTS which fail to implement and enforce single-market legislation
risk being taken to the European Court of Justice, the European Commission
warned yesterday.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC commissioner responsible for the
internal market, told ministers in Brussels he would come down hard on
member states which hold up the free movement of goods, services and
capital.
Legal proceedings have already begun in 320 cases against member states
which have not transposed EC legislation into national law.
Latest statistics show that Ireland, Germany and Greece have implemented
less than 80 per cent of the agreed single market directives, whereas the UK
and Denmark have implemented more than 90 per cent.
In most areas of EC law-making, barriers to free movement were supposed to
come down on January 1 this year, although certain directives do not come
into force until later.
The Commission is particularly worried that member states are lagging behind
with the implementation of directives aimed at opening the lucrative market
for public purchasing, said to be worth some 15 per cent of EC gross
domestic product.
Brussels also says directives which would guarantee recognition of diplomas
and professional qualifications across the EC have not been transposed.
The first directive in this area was supposed to come into force in January
1991, but only Ireland, Denmark, the UK and Luxembourg have passed the
necessary legislation.
The Commission is anxious to maintain the momentum of the extensive
single-market programme, its clearest achievement of the past five years. It
is preparing a 'strategic programme' to improve the effectiveness of the
market.
Speaking after yesterday's meeting of internal market ministers in Brussels,
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said there was widespread concern about the effect on
the single market of recent turmoil on the European currency markets.
Ministers finally agreed yesterday on the vexed issue of which food
additives should be allowed in the EC.
The decision will allow Germany to maintain the purity of its traditional
beers, subject to certain conditions, and Britain to continue adding
colouring to such delicacies as mushy peas, Red Leicester cheese and
sausages.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Partition plan divides Moslems: Izetbegovic presents choice
between 'a just war or an unjust peace' in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROMINENT Bosnian Moslems yesterday debated a partition plan for the
republic amid intense pressure to endorse the Serb-Croat proposal for three
ethnic statelets in an attempt to end the war in Bosnia.
The session upstaged a meeting of Bosnia's multi-ethnic parliament scheduled
for today to vote on the Geneva conference proposal.
Yesterday's ballot was set to determine whether Bosnia's President Alija
Izetbegovic, a Moslem, would sign the plan brokered by international peace
envoys Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. Moslem deputies comprise a
majority of the multi-ethnic wartime assembly.
Although Serb and Croat members of the Moslem-led Bosnian government
attended yesterday's session as observers, their restricted status is a blow
to those Serbs, Croats and Moslems who have fought to preserve the idea of a
multi-ethnic Bosnia.
But it is a partial victory for the Serb and Croat nationalist leaders, who
for months have advocated the concept of separate ethnic states, even though
the three communities used to live intertwined before the outbreak of war in
April 1992.
At the meeting yesterday, comprised of some 350 Moslem intellectuals,
commanders and politicians, Mr Izetbegovic himself apparently avoided making
any clear cut recommendation on whether to accept the plan.
As he outlined the proposal, citing the pros and cons of accepting the
landlocked, unviable state created under the plan, he said the Moslems could
either 'continue a just war or accept an unjust peace'.
He warned deputies 'reality is against us (the Moslems)', but pointed out
that 'many people during history have been strong enough to fight a
long-lasting war and battle.'
Bosnia's Moslems would have difficulty surviving the harsh winter whereas
Serb and Croat mini-states would be uncomfortable but helped considerably by
their patron states, he said.
The lack of a clear line from Mr Izetbegovic reflects the divisions within
the Bosnian Moslem camp about whether they should accept the plan. He has
been virtually deserted by the Croat members of Bosnia's collective
government and has faced fierce criticism from many of his former
colleagues.
Although many deputies appeared to be veering towards an acceptance of the
proposal, speakers sharply criticised western governments and the United
Nations for allowing the partition of Bosnia along ethnic lines drawn by 18
months of war.
Mr Alija Isakovic, president of the Moslem assembly, said: 'It is the height
of hyprocrisy that two aggressors (Serbia and Croatia) are allowed to decide
the fate of the victim.'
But in what appeared to indicate a resigned acceptance of the republic's
division, he said: 'No matter how they divide it, we will consider this
solution temporary, leaving future generations to right this injustice.'
Within Sarajevo itself, this line is undoubtedly popular - after months of
siege, most of the war-weary population is ready for peace, on almost any
terms.
Meanwhile, up in the north-eastern enclave of Bihac, the local Moslem
leadership have adopted an increasingly pragmatic - and independent - line,
concluding their own trade agreement with neighbouring Croat and Serb
populations, with scant regard for far-away Sarajevo.
But buoyed up by their military advances in Central Bosnia in recent months,
some commanders in Central Bosnia, remain reluctant to any compromise at
all.
Over the weekend Mr Stjepan Siber, a deputy commander of the army, said the
army still favoured a unified Bosnia rather than a loose confederation of
mini-states, and said that the partition maps were unsatisfactory in that
they ignored local economic needs.
Whether Mr Izetbegovic will be able to persuade these commanders to observe
any ceasefire drawn up in Sarajevo - or Geneva - will be crucial to whether
any peace agreement can be concluded in the coming weeks.

<TEXT>
CITY councils throughout northern Italy have begun to assess the damage
caused by three days of exceptionally heavy rains that left at least six
people dead.
The main areas affected have been Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont and Valle
d'Aosta. Although the bad weather began to clear yesterday, there was still
serious disruption to road and rail transport.
The worst affected area has been Genoa, where initial estimates have
suggested as much as L1,000bn (Pounds 414m) worth of damage has been done to
infrastructure and buildings. This has prompted moves to have the government
declare Genoa and parts of Liguria a disaster area.
Local government officials and politicians in Genoa were criticised
yesterday for failing to implement adequate flood control measures. The city
backs against steep mountains and the small river channels are easily
blocked or overflow. Traders have planned a demonstration on Thursday.
One of the last of the persons most wanted by Milan magistrates in their
corruption investigations has handed himself in. Mr Aldo Molino, a
Neapolitan-born finance expert, handed himself over at Milan airport on
Sunday after being wanted for four months for questioning on a series of
corruption charges involving some L17bn.
Mr Molino's name has been linked to inquiries into the alleged illicit
financing of political parties by ENI, the state oil company, as well as to
the activities of the Ferruzzi group. He is also believed to be wanted for
questioning in an inquiry into misuse of EC funds for restructuring the
steel industry.

THE HEAD of Norway's European Movement, fighting an uphill battle for
European Community membership, said yesterday the country's chances of
joining hinged on successful EC bids by Sweden and Finland, Reuter reports
from Oslo.
'It's extremely unlikely that Norway will join the EC this century if Sweden
and Finland stay out,' said Mr Inge Loenning, who is also a professor of
theology at Oslo University.
The three Nordic nations are holding parallel talks on EC membership with
Brussels, hoping to join by what many officials say is an extremely
optimistic target of 1995.
Opinion polls show Norwegians are the most sceptical of the three Nordic
applicants.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Poor outlook for steel use raises pressure on industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STEEL use and output are expected to fall further in western Europe this
year, increasing pressure on the industry. However, they may stabilise or
even increase in eastern Europe, apart from Russia, according to the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The latest figures from the Geneva-based ECE show that average world steel
consumption, production, capacity utilisation and prices of all types of
steel product sank last year. Europe and Japan were worst affected, but even
in the US and Latin America, where output rose in 1992, prices were weak,
and the financial position of the industry deteriorated worldwide.
In the European Community, steel consumption fell by 2 per cent last year
and crude steel production by 4 per cent, while capacity utilisation dropped
to 68 per cent. Consumption is expected to drop by a further 7 per cent in
1993, with a fall in production of over 2 per cent.
In the US, consumption rose last year by 7.7 per cent, crude steel
production by 4.2 per cent and capacity utilisation reached 81 per cent.
The situation is expected to improve again in 1993.
The ECE, which groups nations of western and eastern Europe, the US and
Canada, says 1993 may see a slow recovery or stabilisation of economic
activity in much of eastern Europe.
This year could thus prove a turning point for the steel industry, which
produced 11 per cent less crude steel in 1992 than in 1991. In Russia, where
crude steel output fell by 13 per cent in 1992, the outlook for steel demand
and production is more gloomy. A further fall in total industrial production
of 10 per cent to 15 per cent is predicted this year.

FT  28 SEP 93 / UN says over 4m face food shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 4.2m people in the republics of the former Yugoslavia will
experience severe food shortages this winter unless pledges of food aid are
urgently made, the World Food Programme, the UN agency, warned yesterday.
Unless fresh deliveries were made before January, the situation would become
critical, the WFP added, noting that its food stocks for the period after
January were almost exhausted.
The appeal came as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees issued an urgent
warning about the plight of Moslems trapped in the northern Bosnian enclaves
of Maglaj and Tesanj.
Up to 150,000 Moslems, about half of whom were refugees, have been trapped
in the towns by Serb forces who have refused to let any aid enter the region
since early summer, Mr Ray Wilkinson, UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo said
yesterday.
Although the UNHCR has been carrying out emergency airdrops, aid agencies
have been unable to reach the city for several months, and the situation is
believed to be critical.
'From what we know it seems that it is a situation as serious as Mostar,' Mr
Wilkinson said.
The UNHCR estimates that in Bosnia alone some 2.8m people will require food
aid during the next sixth months, including 260,000 tonnes of wheat flour,
biscuits, oil, fish, meat, sugar and salt, at a total cost of almost Dollars
200m (Pounds 130m).
Although the WFP has enough wheat flour for the next three months, only
50-60 per cent of the money needed to buy high protein foods for that period
has been donated, Mr David Morton, WFP co-ordinator in Zagreb, said.

<TEXT>
A SOMBRE director-general of the European Space Agency said yesterday the
world economic crisis would force ESA to slash spending until the year 2001
by Ecus 4bn (Pounds 3.1bn), Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Jean-Marie Luton also indicated to reporters that Europe's most ambitious
space project, the Hermes manned space shuttle, was dead.
Mr Luton was commenting on a draft budget he will propose to industry and
science ministers from ESA's 13 member states, who meet in Paris on October
12-13 to decide future programmes.
Mr Luton said ESA's draft budget for 1994-2000 would be Ecus 18bn (Pounds
13.9bn) instead of Ecus 22bn as planned until drastic cuts in spending were
ordered by the agency's ministerial council in Spain last November.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Ex-Soviet bloc attracts Dollars 42bn: Large-scale energy
projects boost western investment in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors committed more than Dollars 42bn (Pounds 27.2bn) to more
than 1,700 projects in the 28 countries of the former Soviet empire in the
18 months up to the end of March 1993, according to figures compiled by East
European Investment magazine.
The figures, based on data compiled from 160 publications, include outright
acquisitions, investment pledges made as part of privatisation deals and
investment in greenfield projects. However, they do not distinguish between
actual capital flows and associated investment commitments.
Largely for this reason, Russia emerges as the biggest recipient of foreign
investment, accounting for Dollars 10.56bn, more than 25 per cent of the
total, spread over 402 investment deals, including 106 greenfield projects
and 285 joint ventures. The bulk of such deals are concentrated in a
relatively small number of energy-related projects involving large-scale
investment over many years. Such flows are only likely to materialise when
Russia can give investors the legal and proprietorial rights they demand
before committing funds.
The strong showing of Kazakhstan, which has soared to second place in the
investment league table with Dollars 9.12bn pledged or committed, also
reflects the weighting in favour of big projects like the Dollars 6bn-plus
gas exploration and transport project led by British Gas and Agip of Italy,
and the large-scale Chevron oil involvement in the Tenghiz oil field. The
distorting effect on the figures of such projects is shown most clearly in
the case of Azerbaijan, which has announced only seven foreign investment
projects, all joint ventures, with a total investment outlay of Dollars
2.56bn.
Elsewhere, the biggest share, and by the far the greatest number of
investment deals of all kinds, is concentrated in the former communist
states of central Europe.
Poland has emerged as the most popular target for investment, with 162 deals
over the last 18 months totalling Dollars 5.56bn in foreign equity
disbursements and commitments. It is followed by Hungary, which retains its
title as the economy which has attracted most foreign capital per capita. In
the last 18 months, 334 investment deals involving Dollars 3.16bn were
recorded.
The Czech Republic continued to attract more than 90 per cent of total
foreign investment drawn to the now divided Czechoslovakia.
It attracted Dollars 1.4bn compared with the Dollars 191m which was
attracted to Slovakia over this period.
Heavy involvement by US energy, transport and consumer goods corporations
continues to put the US at the head of the investor country league.
US-based corporations committed Dollars 13.6bn to 469 projects, followed by
Italy, where Fiat's Dollars 2bn commitment to Poland and Agip's JV with
British Gas in Kazakhstan boosted the total to Dollars 7.8bn. Report
available from 13 White Lodge, Castlebar Park, London W5. Dollars 290.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Shevardnadze blames defeat on Kremlin
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABKHAZIAN rebels in the former Soviet republic of Georgia seized the Black
Sea port of Sukhumi yesterday, routing the defending forces who were
commanded by the country's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, Reuter reports
from Tbilisi.
Mr Shevardnadze blamed Russia for the defeat in a bitter statement in which
he claimed Moscow could have prevented the final attack - the culmination of
an 11-day offensive.
The former Soviet foreign minister's whereabouts were not immediately known.
Sources close to the government said he had moved from his Sukhumi
headquarters to a safe location near the resort of Gulripshi, 12km to the
south.
'Sukhumi could have been saved even yesterday. Only Russia could have saved
it. We asked Moscow to do it,' Mr Shevardnadze said in a statement
distributed in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.
'Georgia has been brought to its knees, but unfortunately that was not
enough. One reason for Sukhumi's fall is that external forces played the
card of betrayal well.'
Mr Shevardnadze said hundreds of people had been killed and many houses
destroyed in 'barbarian actions'. Efforts to evacuate civilians had failed
completely. Iprinda news agency quoted the Georgian defence minister, Mr
Georgy Karkarashvili, as saying the rebels were allowing retreating Georgian
forces to leave Sukhumi unmolested.
The Abkhazians issued a statement from the rebels' stronghold north of
Sukhumi saying they were offering Mr Shevardnadze safe passage out of the
area. 'It is still impossible to solve this problem by force. We have to
seek peaceful solutions,' Abkhazia's acting president, Mr Vladislav
Ardzinba, said. The head of Abkhazia's rebel parliament left for peace talks
in Geneva and said his side was offering a ceasefire to begin on Friday.
Mr Shevardnadze had refused Russian offers to evacuate him throughout the
siege. Fighting had raged in Sukhumi for several days, with pitched battles
waged around the railway station before the city fell.
The Georgian leader said he had done everything possible to allow Russia to
help his outnumbered forces, including agreeing to the dispatch of extra
Russian forces and to Georgian membership of the Commonwealth of Independent
States. 'God knows I did all I could so that this terrible day would never
come. I was unsuccessful,' his statement said. 'May I be forgiven by my
contemporaries and those who come after me.'
Earlier in the day, as the rebels closed in on the Sukhumi, Mr Shevardnadze
issued a desperate message saying the city would fall unless reinforcements
reached it quickly.
Mr Shevardnadze, one of the chief architects of the Soviet perestroika
reforms alongside Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had gone to Sukhumi after the
collapse of an earlier ceasefire, which had ended more than a year of
fighting that cost thousands of lives.

Repetitive strain injury (RSI) has become the leading professional health
problem in France, where the number of people claiming social security
compensation has tripled over the past five years, it was reported
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris.
An international conference in Nice on health in the workplace was told that
the number of sufferers from stress-related tendonitis reporting their
problems to France's National Office for Health Insurance (CNAM) had risen
from 646 in 1987 to 2,105 last year. This was out of a total of only 5,080
professional illness claims settled by CNAM last year.

<TEXT>
ONE OF the most promising advances in a decade in efforts to swing Basque
public opinion decisively against the terrorist activities of the Eta
separatist movement has been shaken by the deaths of two Eta suspects in
police custody and medical evidence alleging the severe bruising of a third.
Mr Jose Luis Corceura, the interior minister, is scheduled to make an
emergency appearance in parliament in Madrid today to explain the background
to a series of incidents which are worrying the Spanish public.
Eta supporters have been quick to accuse the Spanish civil guard and the
Basque police force, the Ertzaintza, of torturing Miren Gurutze Yanci, who
died of heart failure while in custody last Friday, Xabier Galparsoro, who
died on the same day after falling from the second floor of a police
station, and Maria Jose Lizarribar.
All three were arrested early last week in a police sweep.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Companies urge action on Berlin's future status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of prominent German companies yesterday launched a campaign aimed at
putting pressure on Bonn to make a final decision about moving the
government to Berlin, preferably by 1998.
The campaign, backed by some of the largest foreign investors in eastern
Germany, is supported by Daimler Benz, Sony, Elf, and 27 other companies
which have invested billions of marks in Berlin and the five eastern states.
The campaign was opened two days before the cabinet considers how much it
will cost to move the government to Berlin. Some estimates put it at DM50bn
(Pounds 20bn).
Mr Mark Palmer, the former US ambassador to Hungary, who is spearheading a
big office development complex at Checkpoint Charlie, said it was
'incomprehensible why the government was dithering'. Mr Eberhard Diepgen,
the mayor of Berlin, said the delay was due to 'regional interests' causing
differences between the political parties.
Bonn, a small university town on the Rhine, became the West German seat of
government after the second world war when Berlin, surrounded by East German
territory, was divided. In recent months, the tireless pro-Bonn lobby has
tried to slow the transfer of lucrative ministries and jobs, arguing that
Germany cannot afford the move.
Some Bonn supporters say the move should be delayed by 10 to 15 years while
others have even suggested overturning the vote to move to Berlin.
An opinion survey in August by the Forsa research institute suggested that
50 per cent of Germans want to reverse the decision to move the government
and another 27 per cent want it at least delayed. The Bundestag, or lower
house, voted on July 20 1991 to move the government to Berlin, possibly as
early as 1995. But the government has repeatedly put back the date. It has
been suggested that the move may not happen until after the year 2000. Mr
Manfred Gentz, a board member of Daimler Benz, said there was no reason why
the move could not take place in 1998.
Companies with interests in the east believe the move to Berlin would be
beneficial for three reasons. Psychologically it would help speed up
unification, in the sense that a government based in Berlin would be more in
touch with the difficulties in integrating the two Germanys.
It would provide a crucial economic boost for Berlin, which on the eastern
side has lost more than 130,000 industrial jobs since unification. Companies
with long ties to the city, including Schwarzkopf, the cosmetics
manufacturer, are closing their factories. And with Berlin as the seat of
government, companies believe there would an acceleration in the upgrading
of the city's infrastructure.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Down to one room instead of all Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER CLOSE, the two men who lead the defence of the Russian constitution
have now fallen to argument as the relentless pressure of being cooped in a
giant jar in the middle of Moscow strips away their reserves of tolerance.
General Alexander Rutskoi, 46, acting president with no country to govern
and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, 51, leader of a parliament abolished by fiat,
insist they will never surrender. But beyond that, they have little to do
with each other.
They have not appeared together before their supporters outside the White
House for days.
Mr Khasbulatov's unequivocal prediction at 2.00am yesterday morning that an
attack would come at dawn was later flatly contradicted not just by events,
but also by Gen Rutskoi - though he thinks an attack is imminent.
One of his advisers, asking not to be named, said yesterday the acting
president was infuriated by Mr Khasbulatov's obvious assumption that the
latter was the leader of the resistance - evinced most recently by a remark
made by the parliamentary leader to the deputies that he would 'tell the
acting president to see to it'.
The acting president has risen much better to the occasion than the
parliamentary leader - the former drawing on his military bearing and
discipline, and a theatrical, occasionally almost absurd, populist style.
On Sunday he vowed to 'stay to the death' after touring the White House with
a megaphone demanding of the indifferent riot troops that they 'remember
their oath to the fatherland and the constitution'. Later, he led a few
thousand of the defenders, a ragged-trousered army, round the building, its
various Soviet, Russian Imperial and St Andrew's Cross flags flying bravely.
Mr Khasbulatov has not so responded. Most effective when commanding the
split and formless parliament, he is not fitted to the public gesture. At a
press conference yesterday, he fell back on repetitions of 'there will be no
compromise - it is not for us to compromise with this criminal regime - the
only compromise is a restoration of the constitution', mixed with irrelevant
anecdotes and bad jokes.
He maintains an impressive calm, but at the expense of coherence.
'I don't know what Khasbulatov and Rutskoi are doing together there in the
dark,' said Mr Yeltsin in a television interview at the weekend, with
confident suggestiveness. Yesterday, his deputy chief-of-staff, Mr
Vyacheslav Volkov, said that 'if the law doesn't judge them guilty of some
criminal act, they can decide their own fate'. President Yeltsin and his
team have already consigned them to oblivion, and that may indeed be the
fate of two men, not old for politicians, who rose dizzily from,
respectively, the positions of an Air Force colonel and a professor of
economics to challenge the president of Russia for power.
For Mr Khasbulatov, sharp tongued and by nationality a Chechen (one of the
north Caucasian tribes), there is little support. For Gen Rutskoi, a
Russian, a decorated Afghan veteran and an obvious patriot, there will be
more. Thus it is to him that Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a candidate for president
and a self-appointed go-between, went with advice to drop his 'no surrender'
stance and attempt to negotiate himself out of the jam. 'I have asked the
other (presidential) side not to drive Rutskoi into a corner,' said Mr
Yavlinsky. 'He said he would consider my words, but I think he's not taking
his own decisions.'
In Mr Yavlinsky's view - and it is a common one of Gen Rutskoi - he is an
outwardly impressive but shifting figure, with no strong convictions and
thus prey for powerful or unscrupulous advisers.
That cannot be said of Mr Khasbulatov who, whatever his limitations, goes
his own way.
For mixed motives of ambition, belief and hatred, both men had found
themselves ground below the stone of Mr Yeltsin's new-found determination to
be rid of his enemies.
If there is a way out 'with dignity', it is a small one and it is closing
fast.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEX warns that 'armed men in ski masks' have just evicted the governor
of the Bryansk region for protesting against President Boris Yeltsin's
decree dissolving parliament and convening new elections.
Mr Vasily Cherepanov, deputy chief of the regional council in Perm, a city
in the Urals 800km east of Moscow, sympathises with the telex from Bryansk,
several hundred kilometres away, appealing for solidarity against 'the
appearance of armed dictatorship'. A mild-mannered former communist boss, he
believes Mr Yeltsin is pushing the country towards civil war.
Across the street from his office, a senatorial-looking American, Mr Paul
Weyrich, is teaching activists from Russia's fledgling democratic parties
how to win the parliamentary elections due to be held in two months. None of
the neo-communist parties has been invited. They are the bugbear of the
parties which fear that communists will capitalise on the pain of market
reforms, just as they did in Poland's recent elections.
'Our top priority is to keep the communists out,' says Mr Ergash Narullayev,
an organiser for the Unity and Agreement party, founded only this summer by
the deputy prime minister, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin.
Mr Shakhrai, who is expected to run in presidential elections promised for
next summer, says his party's main aim is to transform Russia into a genuine
federal state to prevent it from falling apart. Twelve other parties are
taking part in the seminar, many of them hopelessly divided when it comes to
working together.
Mr Vladimir Zotov, chairman of the local Democratic Russia Movement, a
coalition of small parties, agrees that the aim is to keep out the
communists and bring in a new parliament sympathetic to market reforms. But
he is worried about what will happen if the 'wrong' kind of entrepreneurs,
concerned only about lobbying for their own interests, go to parliament in
Moscow.
'It would be even worse than Khasbulatov's parliament because the people
will not be responsible to anybody,' says Mr Zotov, who heads the city
council's privatisation committee.
In his presentation, Mr Weyrich covers everything from lobbying to direct
mail and financing the campaign. He emphasises the need for candidates to
organise big public rallies to persuade other people that 'it is safe to
vote for your candidate'.
Many people in the provinces are waiting to see Mr Yeltsin in firm control
before taking a stance. Mr Cherepanov has been unable to get a regional
council quorum to condemn Mr Yeltsin's decision because many of its members
are staying away until the final outcome of events in Moscow becomes
clearer.
Having removed the governor of Bryansk as a warning to other local
governors, many of whom have been appointed by Mr Yeltsin, the Kremlin has
said that only those councils which impede the holding of elections will be
dissolved. The test for Perm's council comes on Friday, when it is supposed
to offer Moscow candidates for the local electoral committee. If it does not
find a way to procrastinate, it could be forced to make its position clear.
The challenge for those who say they want democracy will be to pull
together.
As president of the Krieble Institute, a US non-profit organisation, which
is promoting democracy and free enterprise in the former Soviet empire, Mr
Weyrich is familiar with the weaknesses of anti-communist politicians. 'Not
only do they lack the communists' experience of government, but they are not
used to coming to conclusions and are prone to bickering.'
As for Mr Cherepanov, he is considering running for parliament if Mr Yeltsin
can allay fears of an impending dictatorship by agreeing to run for election
at the same time.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Raw nerve of Germany's state banks: Privatisation call fires
debate as it challenges core of 'social market' principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEBATE has flared up in German political and business circles about the
future of the state-owned banking sector after a call by Mr Otto Lambsdorff,
economics spokesman for the Free Democrats, for the Landesbanken -
commercial banks owned to a large extent by federal Germany's state
governments - and Sparkassen - savings banks owned by local authorities - to
be privatised.
His comments prompted criticism from Mr Horst Kohler, the president of the
powerful German savings bank federation, and from Mr Friedel Neuber, chief
executive of Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), the largest and most
controversial of Germany's Landesbanken.
Public sector credit institutions, which enjoy more than half the German
banking market, would seem obvious candidates for a sell-off.
Privatisation could raise DM100bn-DM150bn (Pounds 40bn-Pounds 60bn) for the
cash-strapped German government, economists have calculated. It would also
fit with the government's new-found commitment to privatisation - outlined
most recently in the economics ministry's policy document on securing the
future of Germany's economic base.
Influential economists, such as Professor Horst Siebert, head of the
Institute for World Economics in Kiel, argue that there are no logical
economic reasons why there should be a state-sector banking industry in
Germany. Everything that the Sparkassen and the Landesbanken did could be
done just as well, if not better, by the private sector, Prof Siebert has
said in a spate of articles and interviews.
Mr Lambsdorff went further than this last month, saying the public sector
institutions had outgrown the special role they played in helping to rebuild
the German economy after the Second World War. The only part of Germany
which needed state-owned banks now was eastern Germany, he argued.
Mr Neuber, the WestLB chief and most prominent public sector banker in
Germany, rejected these arguments in forthright terms, saying the fabric of
society and the stability of the German banking system would be damaged if
it was tampered with.
He added that those who called for privatisation were in fact goaded by the
state sector's steadily improving competitiveness: 'This has not found
favour with everyone,' he said.
Indeed, WestLB's aggressive expansion in recent years has angered the
private sector banks.
The Dusseldorf-based institution is formally house-bank to the state of
North Rhine/Westphalia, responsible for innocuous public sector tasks such
as managing the state's finances, paying its civil servants' salaries and
doling out subsidised loans to support local industry.
But Mr Neuber has a broader concept of the role of a state bank. He has
built up alliances with other, smaller Landesbanken to diversify beyond its
Ruhr-heartland, he has built up an international presence and he has muscled
into corporate banking business which for decades was the preserve of the
private sector. He has also put together a large portfolio of share stakes
in industrial companies.
WestLB says the strategy is designed to support the Ruhr-area's regional
economy. But to critics it is empire-building on the part of an arm of the
Social Democrat controlled state of North Rhine/Westphalia - particularly
inappropriate at a time when Bonn has accepted the need to roll back the
frontiers of the state.
But privatisation in Germany has its limits, and those limits have so far
stopped short of the financial sector. The reason is that the state role in
banking goes right to the heart of Germany's 'social market' economy - where
market forces are tempered by social considerations.
Any attempt to tamper with the status quo would unleash powerful forces of
opposition, not least in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German
parliament which represents the interests of the Lander.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Congress defections bolster Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS DEFECTIONS from the ranks of the defiant Russian parliament emerged
yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin pressed on with his attempts to
dismantle the old constitutional order.
The main figures on both sides in the power struggle stressed their
unwillingness to compromise. Mr Yeltsin said on television that he would not
agree to the so-called 'zero option', which involves allowing parliament to
sit until simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections are held. Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, ruled out negotiations.
However, support for Mr Khasbulatov and General Alexander Rutskoi, the
former vice-president named by parliament as acting president, is dwindling.
The number of deputies remaining in the besieged parliament building,
according to Mr Vyacheslav Volkov, Mr Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, was
down to between 170 and 180 from the more than 600 who turned up last week
to the extraordinary session of the Congress of People's Deputies.
Mr Volkov said the government had appointed a team to find jobs for those
deputies who left and to pay their wages. A total of 76 had already agreed
to be given jobs in the president's already swollen apparatus or in the
government, he added, while 114 more had agreed to discuss such a proposal.
Mr Viktor Barannikov, sacked as security minister by Mr Yeltsin and
reappointed to the same post by parliament last week, was also said to have
defected.
The official news agency Tass reported that Mr Barannikov had asked for a
private session with Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, at which he
asked Mr Chernomyrdin to tell Mr Yeltsin that 'I have been and remain true
to him'.
Mr Barannikov said he had agreed to his appointment solely to oversee a
peaceful resolution to the dispute.
Defections have also come among regions whose councils pronounced themselves
hostile to Mr Yeltsin's banning of parliament and assumption of full
presidential powers.
A meeting of some 40 regional council leaders in St Petersburg on Sunday
joined the growing call for simultaneous presidential and parliamentary
elections, but according to Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov, head of the Russian
parliament's Chamber of Nationalities who attended, the meeting also called
on parliament to negotiate with the president.
Congress, briefly convened yesterday, received his report coldly and took no
decision on it. Mr Khasbulatov said later there would be no negotiations, on
this issue or any other.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and an adviser to Mr Yeltsin,
attended the St Petersburg meeting and hinted that a restitution of
parliament might be possible, but only after agreement on elections.
Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the Constitutional Court, has pressed the 'zero
option' on the parliamentary leadership.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Brown pledges Labour drive for full employment: Party policy
shifts towards growth and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday unveiled a calculated
shift in his party's economic strategy with a commitment to make firm
targets for growth and full employment the priority of a future Labour
government.
Setting the stage for a concerted attack on government policies before the
November Budget, Mr Brown also pledged a clampdown on a range of tax
concessions enjoyed by companies and wealthy individuals.
But his attempt to win the initiative over economic policy on the opening
day of the party's Brighton conference was overshadowed by a public rift
between Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, his
deputy.
To the fury of Mr Smith's aides, Mrs Beckett broke a shadow cabinet
agreement and refused to give him unequivocal backing ahead of tomorrow's
crucial conference vote on reforming the party's links with the trades
unions. Mrs Dawn Primarolo, a less senior member of the frontbench team,
openly criticised the leader's stance.
The outcome of the vote was still balanced on a knife-edge last night as
senior colleagues acknowledged that a defeat would be a severe blow to Mr
Smith's authority.
On the day which saw Mr Tony Benn, the veteran left-winger, lose his place
on the party's national executive after 34 years, Mr Brown used an overtly
populist speech to the conference to argue that mass unemployment had become
the 'over-riding challenge of the 1990s'.
Labour's response would be to ensure 'the full power of government' was
directed towards 'full and fulfilling employment'. A future Labour
government would set a 'growth target' for the economy and invest in
expanding demand and capacity.
Stressing his party's commitment to the poor and the elderly, Mr Brown said
it would also introduce a national minimum wage and would end benefits
'means-testing' for those beyond retirement age.
His emphasis on growth and employment was a sign of the pressure he has been
under from within the party to embrace a more expansionist, interventionist
stance. But it went only half-way to meeting the demand of union leaders
such as Mr John Edmonds who yesterday called on Labour to abandon the
government-imposed spending, tax and borrowing constraints.
Catching the general mood of a series of motions passed by the conference,
Mr Edmonds, leader of the GMB union, said Labour should disavow its cautious
approach to economic policy in favour of 'boldness, imagination and belief
in our own values'.
But the Labour leadership believes the shift in strategy announced yesterday
will position the party for a continuous onslaught on the government in the
two months before the Budget. Mr Smith will reinforce that approach with a
speech to the conference today in which he will combine a lengthy attack on
the government with a commitment to a raft of new industrial, training and
education policies.
Mr Brown reiterated his commitment to a 'fair and progressive' tax system,
but refused to specify what this might mean for the tax rates of individual
voters. Instead he concentrated on setting out what he said were a series of
tax 'loopholes' which would be closed by Labour. These included the abuse of
non-domicile status by overseas companies, unacceptable definitions of
residence and the continuing misuse of offshore trusts.
Labour would also close down tax relief on executive share option schemes
and end petroleum revenue tax provisions which allowed oil companies to
manipulate oil cargo prices.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Opec agrees output ceiling to reverse fall in prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a new production
ceiling yesterday which it hopes will reverse declining oil prices and
persuade markets that members are determined to curb severe overproduction.
The 12 oil ministers agreed that output in the fourth quarter of this year
would be 24.5m barrels a day, slightly less than Opec's third-quarter peak,
but well above the present official ceiling of 23.5m b/d.
But they left the difficult issue of individual country quotas to further
talks which yesterday were adjourned overnight.
Oil markets reacted to the news with a modest price increase. Brent blend
for November was about 20 cents higher at Dollars 16.45 in late London
trading.
The higher output ceiling reflects the expected increased demand toward the
end of the year with the onset of the northern hemisphere winter. Analysts
say the ministers also needed to set a higher figure to balance conflicting
demands including:
The need to set a ceiling which accommodated at least some of the demand for
additional output by countries which have been overproducing, such as Iran
and Nigeria.
The desire to bring Kuwait back into the production ceiling mechanism, which
it left earlier this year because it wanted a much higher quota.
The need to send a signal to the markets that Opec has set a realistic
production level at which any cheating could be kept to a minimum.
The agreement on overall output came after Tehran Radio reported that King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran had spoken by
telephone yesterday on the need for higher oil prices.
The two countries have long been at odds over quotas and market shares. But
in common with other Opec states, they are suffering from sharply reduced
revenues and have set a priority on reaching an agreement which the markets
will see as credible.
'We are thinking in dollars and cents rather than in percentages,' said one
Gulf Arab delegate.
But there were signs last night that the task of allocating individual
quotas could prove difficult. Mr Ali Ahmed Al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti oil
minister, said his country had rejected an offer of 1.9m b/d. 'We want to be
re-integrated, but not on any basis,' he said. Iran and Nigeria were also
understood to be holding out for higher quotas.
Saudi Arabia is understood to be sticking to its present output of 8m b/d
while some smaller producers have agreed to a formula in which they receive
only modest quota increases.

FT  28 SEP 93 / GrandMet surprises City with Pounds 175m restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, sprang another
surprise on the City yesterday by announcing a Pounds 175m restructuring
provision and issuing an upbeat statement on trading conditions and profits.
The announcement follows Friday's unexpected promotion of Mr George Bull to
the position of chief executive. It was widely applauded as an attempt to
improve communications by a group renowned for its complex accounting
arrangements.
GrandMet said most of its operations were performing well and forecast that
profits before exceptional items and tax for the year to September 30 would
be about 5 per cent higher than last year's figure of Pounds 871m.
The group's shares rose 10p on the news to close at 403p, reflecting relief
among many investors, who had feared a fall in profits. The restructuring
will involve the loss of about 3,000 jobs, many in the US, and is expected
to yield annual savings of about Pounds 80m for two years. Around half the
provision will involve cash outlays, to be completed by the end of next
year.
About Pounds 65m of the restructuring provision will cover the closure of
four plants and the loss of 600 jobs at Green Giant, the frozen vegetable
division of Pillsbury, GrandMet's US food manufacturing subsidiary.
A further Pounds 60m will go towards the closure of unprofitable stores and
asset write-offs by Pearle Vision, the US optical retailer owned by
GrandMet. The remaining Pounds 50m will be used to reduce costs and staff
levels across the group's other operations. GrandMet said that though many
world markets remained weak, IDV, its drinks division, expected double-digit
growth in operating profits this year. IDV had increased market share in the
US and was benefiting from improved conditions in Britain.
Pillsbury's sales volumes remained flat, though pricing pressures on Green
Giant had recently eased. Excluding the restructuring plan, operating
profits in food were expected to be above last year and to show a
'substantial' increase after currency translation.
Burger King, the fast food subsidiary, enjoyed further sales growth, though
sales at Chef &amp; Brewer, the UK pub division, would be down on last year.
GrandMet said it was changing its accounting treatment of results from its
Brazilian drinks business to adjust for hyper-inflation. This would result
in a restatement of last year's pre-tax profits, which would be reduced by
Pounds 12m to Pounds 859m.

<TEXT>
Plysu, the plastic container manufacturer based at Milton Keynes in
Buckinghamshire, has appointed David O'Shaughnessy as chairman. He replaces
James Summerlin, the group's co-founder.
O'Shaughnessy became a non-executive director of Plysu in July. He is
chairman of Pira International and already holds non-executive directorships
at Barry Wehmiller International and Britton Group. He spent 35 years with
Metal Box where he became a main board director in 1979. He retired from the
board of Carnaud Metal Box in September 1992.
Summerlin, whose retirement was announced at the AGM in July, has been
appointed honorary life president. He remains a non-executive director.
Last year non-executive directors led a boardroom coup against
Richard Gordon, managing director. There was criticism that
Gordon had been unable to delegate following a series of acquisitions by the
group. He was replaced by Malcolm Macintyre, the former manufacturing
director.

FT  27 SEP 93 / CBOT yields to pressure on Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIFFE is to resume talks on joining Globex, the round-the-clock futures
trading system, after the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) yielded to pressure
from its Globex partners to give up its claim to a key Liffe product.
Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which developed the project
with the CBOT, urged it to relinquish its right to trade bund futures, the
most heavily-traded contract on Liffe.
Globex, developed by Reuters, the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
urgently needs to attract other exchanges to list their futures contracts on
the electronic system, to boost trading volume.
Reuters, the international information and communications group which
contributed the bulk of the estimated Dollars 80m development cost, stands
no chance of recouping its investment unless volume rises. The system is
designed to allow futures trading to continue outside normal exchange hours,
but volume has consistently fallen short of targets since its launch more
than a year ago.
Liffe, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, pulled
out of negotiations last month, when the CBOT laid claim to bund futures.
Reuters has played a pivotal role in getting the negotiations going again.
While publicly declaring its long-term commitment to the project, Reuters
has been dissatisfied with the CBOT's handling of its talks with Liffe. 'We
believe the position on bund contracts you have taken with Liffe is
inconsistent with the Globex agreement,' a Reuters executive wrote in a
letter to CBOT chairman Mr Pat Arbor a week before Liffe discussions ended.
The contract between Reuters and the two Chicago exchanges is due for
renewal in April, but the CME and CBOT have already conceded that they are
unlikely to meet targets of 500 Globex screens in the US and 50,000
contracts traded daily.
Currently, the exchanges are recording 5,000 contracts a day on Globex.
Failure to meet targets could result in a radical restructuring of Globex,
which is currently run by the two Chicago exchanges. Other exchanges have
been deterred from joining Globex, as they are loath to surrender control
over their products to rivals. Like other exchanges, Liffe thinks that a
solution could be to allow Reuters to run the system, rather than the
exchanges. Liffe has said if the issue of control of the system is not
resolved, it will sign only a short-term deal with Globex.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Sutherland warns of farm reforms impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, damped hopes yesterday of any early solution to the critical
dispute between the European Community and the US which threatens world
trade reforms.
Mr Sutherland said an attempt by the EC at French insistence to amend the
Blair House accord reached last November on agriculture between the EC and
the US had created 'an impasse to which a clear solution is not apparent'.
A crucial aspect of the accord envisages a 21 per cent cut in the volume of
subsidised EC food exports over the next six years.
Mr Sutherland, speaking after addressing the International Monetary Fund
interim committee in Washington, said the dispute was among issues that
could wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, are to discuss the dispute in Washington today. It arose
after France called for further 'clarifications' to the accord.
Mr Sutherland, who called for a renewal of the commitment by 116 countries
involved in the Uruguay Round to cut tariffs, added that 'it is our job' to
find a solution to the Blair House dispute.
Mr Sutherland's remarks came as the World Bank disclosed the findings of a
study which concluded that the partial trade liberalisation envisaged under
the Uruguay Round could add Dollars 213bn a year to world income by 2002.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Sharon hits at Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARIEL SHARON, the former Israeli defence minister, attacked Mr Benjamin
Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud party, in a series of interviews
at the weekend for failing to consult party colleagues before coming out so
steadfastly against the Palestinian peace accord.
Mr Sharon, by no means a supporter of the deal, says the Likud ought to have
agreed to some alternative proposals to try to amend 'the most dangerous
aspects of the deal' rather than to have flatly opposed an agreement that
plainly cannot be stopped.
Mr Netanyahu's energetic cross-country campaigning and his mastery of the
television sound-bite helped him to a landslide victory in winning the Likud
leadership last spring. Now, though, critics are hitting back.
Three Likud Knesset members abstained in last Thursday's vote on Israel's
autonomy deal with the PLO, helping Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, to
an easier than expected 61-50 victory, and Mr Sharon is among several Likud
figures who are blaming Mr Netanyahu.
Protests from other party figures concern issues of policy. Mr Netanyahu has
steered the Likud further right, says Mr Meir Shetreet, to ground occupied
by extremist parties which oppose all peace dealings with the Arabs.
Internal Likud divisions look set to deepen in the next few days, with Mr
Netanyahu's supporters pressing to expel Mr Shetreet and the two other
abstainers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS BENAZIR BHUTTO, Pakistan's former prime minister, took her election
campaign to the heart of the Punjab, the country's wealthiest province, over
the weekend as the two front-runners intensified their efforts to make a
comeback in the October 6 elections.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, her main rival, was in Pakistan's poorest province,
Baluchistan, but is expected to step up the campaign in the Punjab this
week.
The Punjab is home to at least 55 per cent of Pakistanis and therefore holds
the key to electoral success. It would elect 115 of the 217 MPs to the
national assembly, the lower house of parliament.
The stakes are also high for elections to the 240-seat provincial assembly.
In 1988, Mr Sharif was able to win enough seats in the province to become
chief minister, while Ms Bhutto formed the central government.
Although no proper opinion polls exist, most analysts believe Ms Bhutto is
overtaking Mr Sharif in up to 80 of 140 key constituencies.
Ms Bhutto gained on two fronts at the weekend. First, Mr Murtaza Bhutto, her
exiled brother, withdrew his nominations from 14 of the 23 constituencies
where he was contesting seats in the national assembly and the provincial
assembly in Sindh.
Second, the PPP announced an alliance with a faction of the Pakistan Moslem
League, which broke away from Mr Sharif this year.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Mexico aims to clean up street markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW streets from Mexico City's oldest and most elegant colonial buildings,
the market of Tepito is in full swing. Thousands of street vendors are
selling everything from expensive Japanese stereos and Yves Saint Laurent
clothes to yellow-faced parrots.
Some vendors sell from semi-permanent stalls, belong to unions, and can make
10 times the minimum wage of 14 new pesos (Dollars 4.50) a day. Others, less
fortunate, wait at traffic lights, offering to clean window screens, sell
chewing gum, or perform circus acts for a few hundred pesos.
From a thousand or so at the beginning of the 1980s, there are now an
estimated 15,000 street vendors in the centre of Mexico City. Once home to
Mexico's smartest and richest, the old colonial part of the city has become
a giant street bazaar, where practically everything that can be bought in
shops can be found, often at a discount of 20-50 per cent.
Until recently, the vendors were tolerated, even encouraged by the
government. Like most successful businessmen in Mexico, they were generous
supporters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI).
The street sellers belong to informal unions, who charge their members
anything from 10 to 50 new pesos a day. The unions often pass on money to
the PRI or police, and arrange support at political rallies.
Now, however, the vendors have come under fierce attack. The city's shop
owners complain that they take away customers, steal their electricity and
foul their pavements. The Finance Ministry wants to collect taxes from them.
Ecologists and residents blame them for the city's worsening congestion and
pollution.
Last year Mexico City authorities finally responded to public pressure and
agreed to build some 37 official markets with the private sector at a cost
of 550m new pesos. The markets will house some 10,000 vendors from the heart
of the colonial centre (not including Tepito), and the first ones are likely
to be ready by the summer.
Mr Roberto Albores Guillen head of the relocation programme, says he is
'nearly 100 per cent sure the vendors will be cleared from the centre' when
the markets are in place.
The government has worked closely with vendor leaders, and has designed the
markets in the same way they are constructed in the street, with passages
along which stalls are established. The markets are being built next to bus
and underground stations to ensure there is a constant flow of traffic
through them.
The vendors will, in theory at least, have to pay taxes for the first time
on goods they sell.
But on the other hand they will own - if they meet monthly payments - their
own stalls, and be incorporated in the formal economy, giving them access to
loans, and reducing their dependence on the union leaders.
The compromise solution, if it works, could become a model for the rest of
Mexico.
In all Mexico there are some 500,000 illegal street vendors with sales of
more than Dollars 35bn a year, according to the main business chamber,
Concanaco.
In Mexico City, the mayor says he will couple a ban on street vendors after
the markets are in place with a 'strategy of modernising rules of trade' for
legal shops, and will consider eliminating unnecessary regulations. The hope
is that successful street vendors would thus be enticed into the formal
economy. The proposed North American Free Trade Agreement may in the long
run help this, by eliminating tariffs between the US and Mexico, and thus
reducing the incentive to import illegally.
Behind the vendors lies an army of rich suppliers. They often smuggle goods
in from the US duty free, or get them from Mexican factories that operate in
the black economy. Such factories avoid income taxes, social security
payments, and burdensome government regulations. These suppliers need
illegal vendors to offload their contraband goods, meaning that official
vendors may lose their competitive edge.
Most important will be the commercial success of the new markets. Were the
markets a failure, the government might not have the stomach to prevent the
politically important vendors from returning to the Colonial Centre, or
places nearby.

AMERICA, captained by Tom Watson, yesterday retained the Ryder Cup at The
Belfry, central England, by 15-13 after being adrift midway through the
final afternoon of the three-day golf event.
The wildly fluctuating fortunes of Europe's golfers were watched by 30,000
spectators - and a worldwide television audience of 250m.
The US side won five of the last six singles to leave the 'home' side
dejected after a confident start in the biennial competition. There was one
moment to savour for the Europeans. Nick Faldo, world No 1, scored a
hole-in-one at the 189-yard 14th - only the second in cup history.
The event is now a big opportunity for corporate entertainment. Over 30,000
tickets a day were sold, 7,500 of these for corporate guests. Some 10,000
baby lobsters met their fate yesterday, while 1,000 sides of fresh salmon
were dished up over the three days, washed down by around 15,000 bottles of
wine on each of the days.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Society man of action - Tony Blair, UK
shadow home secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The party's 'foremost moderniser' or 'the next Labour leader' are the
epithets most commonly applied by political commentators to Tony Blair.
Kenneth Clarke, the Conservatives' own leader-in-waiting, regards the shadow
home secretary as the most dangerous figure on the opposition frontbenches.
Tory MPs have been caught out offering bewildered applause for Mr Blair's
surprisingly tough plans to tackle the country's crime wave.
But life for the fastest-rising star in British politics - he is 40 years of
age and has been in parliament for barely a decade - has hit a rough patch.
The government is in disarray, Mr John Major's premiership is under threat.
Mr John Smith has an 18-point lead in the opinion polls. So the Labour party
is threatening to lapse into its bad old ways.
Mr Blair, along with Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has become the
target of a familiar and less-than-subtle whispering campaign.
The 'one-more-heave' tendency, which spent much of the 1980s opposing Mr
Neil Kinnock's attempts to restore Labour's links with electoral reality, is
back in business.
So, too, are the left-wing critics of 'modernisation' who blame Labour's
fourth successive general election defeat not on the voters' fear of high
tax and spending policies but on its refusal to offer a bold, socialist
vision.
Mr Smith's plans to modernise the party's links with the trades unions
through the introduction of one-member-one-vote (OMOV) in the selection of
parliamentary candidates could yet be defeated at this week's Brighton
conference.
Mr Blair is visibly frustrated. Flashes of exasperation show through an
hour-long exposition of why Labour must change if it is not to remain in
permanent opposition.
'One thing is very important for the party to understand. There is always a
great risk in politics of delusion. There are those who say that Labour lost
the last election because it was too cautious and too timid. The notion that
Labour lost because the electorate thought it was too cautious and too timid
is just one of the more alarming political eccentricities of modern times.'
He warms to the theme: 'The voters did not go into the ballot box and say:
'I want something that is going to set my life alight, so I'm voting for
John Major this time'.'
The frustration shows through: 'We must remember what the election in April
1992 was really like and what people really felt, what their real worries
were about Labour, rather than rewrite history.'
He is similarly dismissive of those who believe that the Conservatives are
now so badly wounded that they will lose whatever. Labour has been there
before. And the Tories responded by dumping Lady Thatcher.
'What I find odd is that after four election defeats, and with Labour not
having won over 40 per cent of the popular vote since 1970, that you have to
argue the case for change.'
So does, as his critics charge, this unself-consciously middle-class
barrister want to swap socialism for social democracy? Is he the David Owen
of the 1990s.
No. In Mr Blair's view his opponents are confusing ends with means. It is
perfectly possible to preserve the party's traditional values while
disavowing the policies once used to apply them.
He puts it bluntly: 'The old style-collectivism that sees the notion of
community action simply through a centralised state has had its day. But
that is not to say the notion of community or social action has had its
day.'
This is what Mr Blair is really about. Instead of arguing about whether to
renationalise this or that industry or spend Pounds 1bn or Pounds 2bn more
on the health service he is seeking a new philosophical framework which
would render obsolete the traditional tests of loyalty to the past.
Labour must distill its basic ideology: 'It stands for community. It
believes individuals achieve success not just by their own efforts but
within a strong community. Now that to me is the basic Labour message and
always has been. What I am saying is that you must apply that message to the
world as it is today.'
Here is the core. The dominant phases in British politics during the present
century had been first the collectivism which brought the post-war
settlement and then the reaction against it during the Thatcherite 1980s.
'Now people are searching for, if you like, almost for a new settlement
between community and individual which recognises the importance of social
action but which recognises the aim is to advance the individual. What the
Tories have ended up doing is saying to people you choose between a strong
society and individual fulfilment. What we are saying is it is necessary to
have a strong society for individuals to succeed.'
But what about policies? The voters of southern England whose mistrust of
Labour cost it the 1992 general election will not be much impressed by
ideological frameworks.
Mr Blair admits that his party has not reached the stage of turning the
principles into a new set of policies. But he insists the direction is
obvious.
It points to forsaking grandiose economic intervention in favour of
encouraging regional and community-based economic enterprise and
regeneration. It underscores the importance of decentralisation and the
enhanced local democracy. It signposts an approach to the workplace which
guarantees the rights of individual workers through the law rather than
simply through the collective action of trades unions.
Mr Blair can also claim that the law and order policy which has won him
plaudits this year is drawn directly from his theoretical framework.
By staking out the responsibility of society to deter and prevent crime he
has won himself the room for manoeuvre to demand tough and effective action
against those who flout their responsibility. 'The purpose of social
action,' he says, 'is to allow individuals to take responsibility for
themselves, not to substitute for it.'
Local communities should create partnerships to divert young people from
crime but there must be 'sufficient secure accommodation in the community
that if youngsters are out of control you must have the ability to put them
under lock and key until they do behave'.
But before it can address the electorate Labour must sort out the internal
constitutional wrangle with the unions which has already cast a long shadow
over this week's conference. The vote - on the superficially arcane issue of
just how trades unionists should participate in the selection of Labour's
parliamentary candidates - has become a litmus test of whether the party is
willing to change.
Mr Blair puts it thus: 'It is necessary to advocate change within Labour
before we can win the opportunity to change the country.'
He will not say it, but he is clearly furious with the refusal of many of
the unions to back a relatively modest reform. The union leaders are
clinging on to their institutional levers within the party but forgetting
that real influence comes with government.
Mr Blair leaves the impression that if he were leader, OMOV would be just
the start. In his view, Labour's hope for the future lies in re-establishing
its links with ordinary people by a determined drive to recruit more
individual members.
The model is his own Sedgefield constituency where an experimental
membership scheme has brought the party hundreds of new recruits. He
believes the cut-price membership proposed for union members would further
tilt the balance in local parties away from the internal preoccupations of
their activists towards the concerns of the wider community.
It all sounds pretty convincing stuff, the more so because it is set out
with a calm fluency and coherence all too rare these days in British
politics. It is the sort of programme that might even win Labour a general
election. But, as this week's Brighton conference will remind us, Mr Blair
has as many enemies as friends in his own party.

FT  27 SEP 93 / More Maastricht to come: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maastricht is not a popular treaty. After so much hassle, disappointment and
interminable argument, many may feel, not unreasonably, that they've already
heard just about as much as they can stand, and wish the politicians would
change the subject.
If so, they are destined to be disappointed. For we are probably on the
threshold of yet another Europe-wide debate about the treaty, which is
likely to inaugurate the biggest and most politically charged discussion on
the future of Europe since the epic struggles of the 1960s.
This debate is unavoidable. The treaty is a ramshackle structure with
disparate pieces tacked together, some of which were improvised in haste in
response to German unification. And the consequence of improvisation and
ambiguity, and of the impact of outside events, is that it does not look
viable as framed. The programme for monetary union obviously needs to be
re-examined, if only because a significant number of member states will not
be able, and some will not be willing, to meet the conditions for a single
currency. The commitment to a common foreign policy looks merely ridiculous
in the light of the Yugoslav disaster.
In theory these treaty imperfections could be side-stepped: those who don't
want a single currency or a single foreign policy could simply stay outside
the integrationist stream, and the Community would gradually diverge on
variable-geometry lines. But there is one new problem facing the Community
which cannot be side-stepped: how far can it expand with new members, and
what will be the institutional consequences? This is the issue which makes
unavoidable the debate now getting under way.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has tried to hijack that debate
in advance, so as to pre-empt any attempt by others to press for an
acceleration of the traditional Community integration process. His vision of
the Community, which he has set out in a long article in The Economist, is
of a Europe which is large and loose, inter-governmental rather than
integrated. In place of the old (and discredited) objective of European
Monetary Union, it needs a new agenda, whose immediate priorities should be
the conclusion of the Uruguay trade round, the deregulation of labour
markets and the slimming of welfare costs. The longer objective should be to
include the whole of Europe.
This anti-integrationist vision is a characteristically British recipe. It
is unlikely to prove any more persuasive to the other member states today,
however, than it has in the past. The original six, at least, have been
committed to an integrationist model of the Community for 40 years. They
will not abandon it lightly, least of all to please Britain.
By contrast, a far-reaching integrationist vision has already been marked
out by Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party, in a paper drafted by Mr
Karl Lamers, the party's foreign affairs spokesman. Even if this is not an
official government document, it is likely to indicate where Germany will
stand at next month's Community summit.
Like Mr Major, Mr Lamers insists on the need to reach a successful
conclusion of the Uruguay round. But on almost every other issue his vision
of Europe is diametrically opposed to that of Mr Major. He maintains, for
example, that 'it is essential, despite the problems that have recently
beset the EMS, that the goal of monetary union and the timetable proposed be
adhered to'. In other areas of the Maastricht treaty, the Community must
press ahead with policy integration: asylum and immigration, the fight
against organised crime, and a common foreign policy.
Security policy is an issue of clear divergence of emphasis between the
British and German visions. Mr Major stresses the importance of Nato, within
which 'the Europeans should take on greater responsibility'. But Mr Lamers
says that the Western European Union defence grouping should be strengthened
'and equipped with military forces', as the best way to ensure a continued
American commitment.
The biggest gulf between Major and Lamers concerns the Community's
institutions. They both believe that the Community must eventually take in
the countries of eastern Europe. But whereas Mr Major wants an
intergovernmental Community of nation states, Mr Lamers believes enlargement
requires a strengthening of the integration principle.
'The expansion of the Community . . . must not be allowed to weaken the
degree of integration already achieved by the present core; on the contrary
this must be strengthened. Otherwise the European Union will not be able to
help solve the increasingly life-threatening crises of the nations that make
it up . . . For that reason, institutional reforms of the Community must be
undertaken in parallel to the membership negotiations currently in hand with
the Efta countries.'
These institutional reforms should include a radical strengthening of
majority voting in the Council of Ministers, combined with a sharp reduction
in the voting premium currently enjoyed by the small member states. The most
dramatic change would be the abandonment of all unanimous voting, to be
replaced by a 'super-qualified majority': with votes of four-fifths of the
members representing at least four-fifths of the population.
The Lamers vision is obviously overambitious. But if anything like it is put
forward by Germany next month, we can be sure that it will open up a
far-reaching debate about fundamental principles which were left on one side
during the Maastricht negotiations.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Asian miracle that wasn't: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People who believe in a 'third way' - an economic philosophy that offers a
surer path to equitable growth than either market capitalism or socialism -
often find themselves looking east. Led by Japan a group of dynamic East
Asian economies appears to have flouted the rules of market economics yet
achieved unparalleled economic success.
If these countries have found a new elixir of growth, the rest of the world
needs the formula. If they have not, the world also needs to know because
Asian success is increasingly seen as proof of the obsolescence of
Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Many people in formerly communist countries believe
the 'East Asian model' offers a better prospect than orthodox free-market
prescriptions. To assess these claims, the World Bank undertook a mammoth
research project involving comparative studies of eight leading Asian
economies over several decades. Economists of all ideological persuasions
will find its report, published today, of considerable interest.
The sceptics who argue that East Asia 'did things differently' will be
gratified that the bank now concedes that most of the countries deviated
substantially from free-market doctrines. At least three types of
intervention were ubiquitous: industrial policies designed to promote
particular sectors or companies; government controls on financial markets to
lower the cost of capital and direct credit to favoured sectors; and
policies to promote exports that included extensive protection of domestic
industries.
But do not leap to conclusions. As the bank argues, the principal reason for
the region's success is its adherence to economic fundamentals.
Macroeconomic policies have been consistently prudent: the hallmarks are low
inflation, low or negative budget deficits and modest foreign debts. Workers
have studied longer, worked harder and saved more than their counterparts
elsewhere.
And although the Asian 'stars' certainly deviated from market norms, they
did so less on average than other developing countries. The price of factors
of production such as capital and labour was kept much closer to
market-clearing levels than in less buoyant regions such as Latin America or
sub-Saharan Africa. Since the countries that intervened least grew most
rapidly, it is hard to conclude that the interventions were hugely
important.
In any case, East Asian policies have evolved over the decades. The
heavy-handed interventions occurred in Japan, Korea and, to a lesser extent,
Singapore, from the 1950s to the 1970s when the world was a very different
place. In those days, the rich western democracies also heavily regulated
their financial markets and indulged in all kinds of domestic interventions.
East Asia has tended to keep up with the times. The Asian stars that emerged
during the 1980s - Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand - have followed more
market-oriented policies than their predecessors. Meanwhile, countries like
Korea have also seen the merits of more liberal policies.
The bank concludes that Asian experiments with industrial policies were
mostly a failure because unaided market forces would have brought about the
desired changes in industrial structure. It concedes that directed credit
and other forms of 'financial repression' did sometimes increase savings and
investment. But it reserves praise for the area's 'export push' strategy
which imposed a powerful competitive discipline on local companies and
accelerated the transfer of technology from more advanced economies.
This leaves would-be imitators of East Asia in a bind. If the bank is to be
believed, industrial policies do not work. Financial repression may work but
is much harder to implement in today's globally integrated capital markets
than decades ago when Japanese and Korean bureaucrats parcelled out credit
like children's presents. Crude attempts to promote exports are equally
problematic because industrial countries (especially the US) are determined
to create a level global playing field in trade. Developing countries can
and should lift artificial barriers to exports but they cannot any longer
combine export promotion with overt protection of home markets.
Should we shed tears because many of the apparent deviations from market
principles pioneered by Japan and Korea no longer seem credible? The answer
is no, for a reason not brought out sufficiently clearly in the bank's
report. These countries never had a long-term alternative to western market
capitalism. It is true that they glorified their producers and suppressed
their consumers. But they only became efficient producers because they
sought instead to serve the interests of a richer, more numerous and
sophisticated group of consumers: the citizens of western democracies who
bought their exports.
Had western consumers (especially Americans) not existed, the East Asian
miracle simply could not have occurred. Without the guiding star of western
consumer preferences their leading companies would have had no more idea of
what to produce, or how, than former Soviet or east European state
enterprises. As they mature the Asian high-fliers will be forced to treat
their own consumers with more respect, in the process completing the
transition to western market capitalism. There is no third way.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRING of US data this week should help dealers to decide whether the
dollar has a firm underpinning, writes James Blitz.
The US currency is bound to affected in the immediate term by events in
Russia and by anything that may have emerged from the weekend meeting of G7
finance ministers in Washington.
But the most serious problems that the dollar has faced in recent weeks have
been related to new perceptions that the US economy is having a difficult
recovery.
Tomorrow's consumer confidence figures for September, issued by the
Conference Board, will therefore be looked at closely as a sign of whether
US citizens are in a position to go out and spend. Last month's figure was
59.0 and the market consensus is for a rise to 60.00.
Two other indicators could also the move the dollar. The final revision of
the second quarter GDP figure is due on Wednesday: the market is looking for
the figure to remain unrevised at 1.8 per cent.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers report is also due on
Friday: the market expects the figure to rise from 49.3 per cent to 50 per
cent.
In Europe, there will be a strong focus on the French unemployment figures
due out on Thursday.
The market is looking for a rise in the figure for August, from 11.7 per
cent to 11.8 per cent. That could put more pressure on the French
authorities to ease their intervention rate, currently at 6.75 per cent, if
they do not do so today.
Japan has a host of economic data but few of the numbers are likely to
excite the markets there either. Economists say inflation remains subdued
and expect little good news from the retail sales and industrial production
numbers.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Father of football pools outlived his critics: Obituary -
Sir John Moores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Moores, who has died at the age of 97, made his fortune by
inventing football pools in 1923 with his brother Cecil. He then used the
money to build the Liverpool-based Littlewoods retailing and mail order
group into one of the largest privately-owned businesses in the world.
Born in January 1896, the son of an Eccles, Lancashire, building contractor,
he became one of the UK's most successful entrepreneurs. But in contrast to
many who achieved much less, he spent most of it an outsider as far as the
British establishment was concerned.
He was made a CBE in 1972 but it was not until the safe old age of 84 that
he was knighted. By then, it was impossible not to acknowledge his
achievements, not only in creating thousands of jobs throughout Britain, but
also as a patron of the arts who had created a family dynasty.
It was the origins of his wealth in football pools that almost certainly
precluded faster recognition. He was also small, unprepossessing in
appearance, reclusive, and disinclined to promote himself or his image - or
reinvent his origins after he had long outlived his early critics.
The 'pools' - now a British national institution in their own right -
purport to be a game of skill in which people try to predict the results of
soccer matches. In reality, they are a form of gambling, the odds against
winning significant sums by skill being astronomical.
When the Moores brothers started them in 1923, Ramsey MacDonald, who became
Britain's first Labour prime minister a year later, attacked them as 'a
disease which spread downwards to the industrious poor from the idle rich.'
The industrious poor, recognising the pools as one of their few chances in
life to become rich, took no notice and started filling in the coupons. The
Moores brothers were millionaires within a few years, but were never idle:
they set about building a business empire in Liverpool.
They split the business in 1932, with Cecil running the pools and John
founding Littlewoods, first as a mail order house selling via a pioneering
catalogue and then as a chain of retail shops.
Catalogue and shops were pitched at lower middle and working class tastes
and markets. Catalogue agents were generally housewives, selling to their
neighbours.
Rebuffed by a snooty Football Association when he tried to pass some wealth
back into the game, John Moores adopted a provincial strategy, putting money
and effort into Everton, and becoming chairman of the football club.
Everton became famous for its skillful play; Goodison Park, its stadium, was
nick-named the 'School of Science' by its fans. Liverpool, Merseyside's
other famous club, was not neglected. Moores became its biggest shareholder
too, although he kept this so quiet many fans never realised it until a
couple of decades ago.
But although he intervened personally to sack a couple of Everton managers
who had fallen from the heights of success, these were hobbies.
The real business was at Littlewoods, which became another British
institution in its own right, eventually turning over billions of pounds.
Whether he managed the enterprise or ruled it is open to question. He was
known universally as 'Mr John' and played the patriarch. Staff were in awe
of him and sometimes in terror, but he also commanded great loyalty.
Some still tell of his showing underlings large bonus cheques for the year -
and then tearing them up before their eyes because targets had been missed.
This glimpse of what might have been was supposed to spur victims to greater
effort.
His parsimony was also the stuff of legend, but underneath it lay a hatred
of waste and profligacy. Managerially, he was a hands-on chief executive who
was on top of the detail, which he often jotted down in his notebook while
touring his empire.
He tried to retire at 81 but trouble struck and three years later, he was
back in charge. By this time, he knew his sprawling empire needed new brooms
who had learned their management elsewhere.
By the mid-1980s, he had recruited Des Pitcher, since knighted, as chief
executive and John Clement, the head of Unigate, as non-executive chairman,
with himself hovering in the background as president. Clement nearly turned
the job down after spending some time wandering round Littlewoods to assess
the atmosphere. 'You interfere too much,' he told Moores, seeing himself
having to spend too much time arguing with the old man. 'Well, of course I
do,' Moores told him, giggling at a rebuke he saw as proof of Clement's
mettle.
Sir John's philanthropy was notable. There are few charities and social
initiatives on Merseyside that have not got Moores money or family members
or Littlewoods managerial talent involved in them.
The biennial 'John Moores' contemporary art exhibition and competition at
Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery quickly became one of the most important in
the cultural calendar.
A lasting monument was assured when Liverpool Polytechnic took the name of
Liverpool John Moores University last year when it was elevated to
university status.
In his last years he lived quietly in his house in the pinewoods near the
sea in Formby. Apart from his Rolls Royce - registration number JM1 - which
he drove himself and with unfailing courtesy towards other users of the A565
through Crosby, he was never ostentatious.
He suffered for his wealth when burglars attacked him at home in 1989,
knocking him on the head after he put up a fight. Well into his nineties,
with his health impaired, he was seldom seen in public afterwards.
A family squabble in 1990 saw divisions about whether Littlewoods should go
public, but Sir John's allies prevailed. So there may well be a pent-up head
of steam now to change tack.
The 32 family shareholders are rich on paper but mostly merely well off in
cash terms. Sir John's legendary parsimony extended to dividends and they
got only Pounds 400,000 between them in 1992 - of a business likely to be
worth Pounds 2bn on flotation.
Since some have pushed to realise their equity already, Sir John's death may
well spur them to try again.

FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: Auction to test strength of support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEST of the continuing strength of the recent support for gilts from
non-UK institutions will come this Wednesday when the Bank of England
attempts to sell a further Pounds 3.25bn worth of the securities.
The Bank's latest auction is of an 11-year stock in the part of the yield
curve generally favoured by overseas investment groups on the grounds that
it is easily tradeable.
While foreign interest in gilts has been extremely high since the beginning
of the year, some in the gilt market believe purchasing by overseas groups
may wane in the coming months because of renewed concern about the UK
inflation outlook.
In this camp is Mr John Shepperd, a bond specialist at Yamaichi Securities,
who says gilt prices 'may have passed their peak' on account of the
possibilities of a stirring in inflationary pressures as the UK economy
picks up.
This week's auction, required to gain more cash to pay for the 1993-1994
Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement, will indicate to what degree overseas
institutions agree with Mr Shepperd. In the second quarter of this year,
non-UK groups including governments bought gilts worth Pounds 4.57bn after
Pounds 2.1bn in the first quarter, helping the Bank to be in the comfortable
position of already having borrowed around two-thirds of the money it will
need for the whole of the financial year.
As gilts traded quietly last week ahead of the auction, focus also turned to
comments by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, sketching out
a vision of pan-European co-operation based around inflation targets for
individual countries.
While some gilt specialists reckoned Mr George's ideas were somewhat risky -
given the lack of experience in using such targets to steer policy - it was
regarded as an interesting effort to fill the policy vacuum left after last
month's virtual breakdown of the exchange rate mechanism. The governor
appeared to be urging other countries to follow the path of Britain, which
after dropping out of the ERM a year ago adopted a policy of trying to keep
underlying inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the retail
prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, at under 4 per cent.
However, one gilt expert said of Mr George's comments: 'With the strong
possibility that the 4 per cent limit may be breached over the next year or
so, Britain has yet to convince the rest of Europe that ideas like this can
really deliver the goods in terms of helping economic stability.'
While these comments sound all the more apposite in view of the gilt's
market shock earlier this month from the latest upward blip in the RPI,
investors gained some comfort from Friday's survey of manufacturing trends
from the Confederation of British Industry showing few companies are
considering price rises.
The survey of some 1,500 manufacturers showed that 11 per cent expected to
reduce prices for domestic orders over the next four months while 10 per
cent thought they would be in a position to increase them. This indicates a
continuation of the strong competitive pressures on makers of factory goods,
resulting from UK demand still being relatively weak in spite of recent
recovery signs. At the retail level, Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of the
Dixons store chain, said retail margins 'were likely to stay under pressure'
for some time, in a comment also likely to soothe nervousness about
inflation trends.
Less concerned than some about inflationary pressures is Mr Simon Briscoe,
economist at SG Warburg Securities, who says recent economic data have
generally underlined the view that the recovery is weaker than has been
expected, a development that should restrain any tendency for inflation to
pick up. As though confirming this view, yields for 10-year gilts over the
past week have come down by about five basis points to just over 7 per cent.
The gap between these yields and those for 10-year German government bonds
was quoted on Friday night at about 93 basis points, underlining the better
performance for gilts since roughly a weak ago when the yield spread was 110
basis points.

FT  27 SEP 93 / European Bonds: Volatility still the name of the game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLATILITY will remain the name of the game in Europe's bond markets this
week, although most analysts expect fundamental factors to gradually
reassert themselves as the Russian constitutional crisis loses momentum.
Bond prices see-sawed last week on reports of troop movements and civil-war
warnings following President Boris Yeltsin's suspension of Russia's
parliament.
Germany, which is seen as being most vulnerable to upheaval in Russia due to
its close political and economic ties, took the worst beating, with the
currency plunging and yields on 10-year bunds climbing some 10 basis points
on the week. Most continental European markets were dragged lower by
Germany, though lagging its losses slightly.
The main beneficiaries were those bond markets which had already fallen
sharply prior to the Russian turmoil: UK gilts and Italian bonds. Moreover,
US Treasuries saw heavy buying on the US currency's perceived safe-haven
status.
But unless the Russian crisis escalates, many of last week's flows may be
reversed this week, with investors focusing again on Europe's fundamentals:
anaemic growth and weak inflation fuelling hopes of further rate cuts.
Expectations for Danish easing were met earlier than expected when key
interest rates were cut by  1/2 point late on Friday. 'The currency remained
strong after the rate cuts, which indicates Denmark can continue easing in
coming weeks,' said Mr Werner Kramer, bond strategist with DB Research,
Deutsche Bank's analysis subsidiary. 'That will continue supporting the
Danish market.'
Talk of French rate cuts was also rife ahead of the Group of Seven meeting
in Washington, where France was expected to come under pressure to cut its
rates, which have been kept high to protect the franc against the D-Mark.
Moreover, the Bank of France probably took advantage of the franc's relative
strength last week to replenish some of its foreign-currency reserves,
facilitating an easing, said Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at
Midland Global Markets. The need to shore up its reserves, which were
depleted heavily during the recent European currency crisis, has been seen
as one of the reasons for the central bank's unwillingness to ease.
According to the perverse logic of the currency markets, a rate cut will
probably boost the franc, fuel further easing hopes and support the bond
market.
While German bonds will remain overshadowed by the Russian power struggle,
investors will be cheered by the latest inflation data, which were lower
than expected. On the basis of regional CPI data released on Friday, western
German inflation is likely to be 4 per cent in September, down from 4.2 per
cent in August.
Mr Kramer at DB Research says long-term investors should seize upon bunds'
current weakness to buy. 'The German markets will remain volatile in the
short term, but on a three to six-month horizon we see 10-year yields going
well below 6 per cent.' The 10-year bund yield closed at 6.16 per cent on
Friday.
He also favours UK gilts, where low inflation and economic growth prospects
support the currency and yield outlook. Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3 1/4
bn of 6 3/4 per cent 2004 gilts is likely to meet strong international
demand, he said.
One way for investors to reduce exposure to near-term volatility is to
switch to the short end, said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market
analysis firm IDEA. 'The short end of most yield curves is the safest area -
the long end will get whipped around by further unrest in Russia,' he said.

FT  27 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Fed switches back into neutral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST minutes from the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee have
just been released and show a surprising, albeit subtle, shift in opinion
among the members of the central bank's main policy-making body.
The minutes for the August 17 meeting showed that the FOMC voted unanimously
to keep policy unchanged, but also to remove its earlier bias toward
tightening and switch toward a symmetrical directive.
In English, this means that the Fed is no longer so concerned about
inflation, and, therefore, is now less inclined to make the next move in
interest rates an upward one. The explanation for the shift was given in the
minutes, which said: 'Members (of the FOMC) observed that the more
favourable performance of key measures of prices in recent months had tended
to relieve earlier concerns about a possible worsening in inflation.'
The FOMC, however, always on guard against sending the wrong message to the
fixed-income markets, added a big 'but' to the above statement: 'However,
because the recent price indexes probably overstated the improvement in the
trend rate of inflation, it was too early to determine whether they pointed
to renewed disinflation.'
The shift to a symmetrical directive on August 17 is particularly
interesting for two reasons.
It is interesting because senior members of the Fed, and self-appointed
members of the alternative Fed (the Shadow Open Market Committee of
economists that seems to have taken upon itself to act as the Fed's
monetarist conscience) have been warning in recent weeks that if interest
rate policy remains too accommodating, a speculative 'bubble' in stock and
bond prices could inflate, and then burst, with dramatic consequences for
the financial markets and the economy.
The shift in policy is also intriguing because the most recent inflation
data, released just under two weeks ago, appears to justify the Fed's
qualifying statement in the August FOMC minutes. The latest figures showed
that consumer prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, which was well above
Wall Street's forecast of a 0.1 per cent increase.
Those figures gave the bond market a big shock, and presaged the return of
long yields to back above 6 per cent, where they have stayed stubbornly ever
since. That sell-off, and subsequent declines that were halted only in the
final days of last week, prompted some observers to declare the bond market
rally over.
That could be a bit premature, for longer-dated prices jumped in the final
hours of trading last Friday when the news of the FOMC's new stance was
released.
Yet, if the market reacts so positively to the FOMC's policy shift of August
17, it is just as likely to react negatively when the minutes of the latest
FOMC meeting, held just last week, are released. Given that the most recent
inflation numbers alarmed investors with their robustness, those minutes
could well show that the committee has voted to return to a non-symmetrical
stance with a bias toward tightening.
If there is anything to be learned from the market's reaction to the latest
FOMC minutes it is that investors should be wary of the coming weeks with
the market in such a fragile state. A raft of economic data is due and
several broking houses believe the figures will show a resurgence in
economic activity.
If the data does come in stronger than expected, then bond prices could
tumble. The market has not forgotten the worrying August consumer prices
number, and is likely to speculate much about what the FOMC decided last
week. Against this background, no one is confidently predicting the return
of bond yields to below 6 per cent.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Risk and Reward: Hedge fund managers look for change in
Japanese sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON's 12 Japanese equity warrant market makers will be joined today by DE
Shaw Securities International, a subsidiary of the New York-based hedge fund
DE Shaw &amp; Co.
After the Tokyo stock market slump in 1990, several London securities houses
pulled out of Japanese equity warrant market-making. The market's stronger
performance this year - with the Nikkei index climbing to around 20,000 from
16,994 at the start of the year - has prompted speculation that the market
may be on the way to recovery. But others are forecasting more sideways
trading as long as political uncertainty lingers and economic recovery
remains sluggish.
This has some market participants wondering whether this is an opportune
time for a new firm to enter the market. However, 'it would be foolish to
ignore the Japanese market,' said Mr Lou Salkind, DE Shaw Securities'
managing director. 'At some stage the switch into stocks has to happen,'
added Mr Steven Fine, the firm's institutional sales manager. Moreover, he
notes that many international investors are heavily underweight Japan but
likely to reverse that stance when sentiment turns.
DE Shaw plans to make markets in some 480 Japanese equity warrants,
including many illiquid warrants in which few houses are willing to make a
market.
By setting up this trading subsidiary, its parent company, which started as
a proprietary trading firm, wants to expand into more traditional investment
banking activities. 'We were founded to do quantitative, low-risk trading
and have a very scientific background, which is unusual in investment
banking,' said Mr Salkind.
The firm's decision to shift from its base as a hedge fund raises some
interesting questions about the evolution of the market. When the Japanese
equity warrants market had its peak year in 1989, the market attracted all
manner of investors, both in the Far East and Europe, and was actively
traded by marketmakers. Even after this year's rally, the Nikkei 225 index
has only reached just over half its peak level of 39,000 at the end of 1989.
In the lean years which followed, it has been the activity of hedge funds
which has kept the market alive.
Most investors abandoned the market in Japanese equity warrants, since the
bulk of them were trading far 'out-of-the-money' - that is the exercise
price of the warrants was substantially above the share price - with little
chance that they would ever be worth exercising into the underlying shares.
In a bear market for Japanese stocks, the market for such warrants was
clearly doomed.
But hedge funds are different because trades are usually market-neutral. In
the equity warrants market a typical hedge trade is based on the purchase of
a basket of warrants which is then neutralised by the simultaneous selling
of index futures. It does not matter whether the market rises or falls: the
out-of-the-money warrants and the stock futures exhibit different types of
price performances, which allows arbitrage profits to be extracted from the
trade.
That, at least, is the theory. The problem has been that, although the Tokyo
stock market has improved in price performance this year, volatility has
been low. For the hedge fund manager it is volatility, rather than price
performance, which affects the performance of the fund.
Nevertheless, in a still uncertain environment for Japanese equities, the
attraction of the hedge fund is that 'the investor does not have to take a
view on which way the market is going to go,' says Mr Michael
Campbell-Birkett, of Cresvale International Asset Management, which runs
several hedge funds.
The signs are that more investors are now prepared to take a view on the
Japanese market, although they remain cautious. As one trader said, 'fund
managers are shifting their asset allocation (in Japanese stocks) from
massively underweight to, at best, neutral.'
If the Japanese market does start to rally, equity warrants, many of which
are trading cheaply according to dealers, could be in demand again. And more
dramatic market movements would also be welcomed by becalmed hedge fund
managers.

FT  27 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Asia's dragon sector at last gets off
the ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAGON bond market, Asia's regional capital market, has finally got off
the ground, two years after it was set up by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) in an effort to develop the capital markets in this part of the world.
In the last week, Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), Austria's
import-export agency, and Rabobank Nederland, the triple-A rated Dutch bank,
both raised Dollars 200m each through offerings of five-year and three-year
dragon bonds respectively.
Most of the dragon bond issues launched so far have been short-dated,
reflecting the early stage of the market's development as well as the
short-term horizons of many Asian investors.
Including these two issues, the outstanding amount in the dragon bond market
now stands at around Dollars 3bn. If the flow of issues continues at the
current pace, volume could more than treble to Dollars 10bn by the end of
1994, according to Lehman Brothers, one of the several investment banks
which are actively promoting the dragon bond concept.
So far, the dragon bond market has been tapped by issuers which already have
a wide following in Europe, the US and Japan and which are seeking to widen
their investor base in the rapidly-growing economies in the rest of Asia.
They also see this market as a useful way to increase their profile with
non-Japanese investors in Asia, thereby facilitating their commercial
activities in the region.
As a result, the jury is still out on whether the dragon bond market will
ever be anything more than a useful but illiquid adjunct to the established
Eurobond market, where issuance has reached Dollars 295bn so far this year.
Bankers who believe the dragon bond market is merely a parody of the
Eurobond market give several reasons for taking this view, the most
important being the virtual non-existence in Asia of a secondary market in
dragon bonds.
This effectively means that a large proportion of the bonds flow back to
Europe, where there is a secondary market. In addition, dragon bonds are
cleared through Euroclear and Cedel, both of which are based in Europe,
although there are moves to develop a regional clearing system in Asia.
The bankers also point to the exclusive nature of the dragon bond market. So
far, all the issuers have been of a high quality and no local borrowers,
apart from the ADB, have made an appearance.
This perception of the market could be dispelled if rumours of a dragon bond
issue from the People's Republic of China come true. An offering by the
dominant nation in the region would open the floodgates for other Asian
sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers.
Another contentious issue has been the pricing of dragon bonds. Some of the
issues launched earlier in the summer were widely thought to have been too
tightly priced and as a result were seen to have performed poorly.
Bankers say this gave Asian investors the impression that borrowers saw the
market as a source of cheap funding. 'Why should Asian investors pay a
premium for something that is illiquid?' asked one senior investment banker.
However, the pricing of recent dragon bond issues has been more in line with
levels which the borrowers have to pay in the Eurobond market. 'In our
opinion, issuers pay the same price there as in Europe,' said Mr Andrew
Pisker, head of fixed-income new issues at Lehman Brothers International.
Those who believe in the importance of a fully-fledged capital market in
Asia are eager to make the dragon bond market a success. For example, OKB
delayed its issue by two months until it was confident that the underwriting
banks would make a market in the bonds in Asia and not just in London or
Tokyo.
'When we did our roadshow in the region, the major concern which investors
had was the lack of liquidity in the secondary market,' said a senior
official at OKB.
Bankers have no doubt that Asia's capital markets will grow in the coming
years, in tandem with China's transformation into a major economic force in
the region and in the world.
Nevertheless, many feel that expectations placed on the dragon bond market
are far too high. 'It's a bit like expecting a little airplane to carry
hoards of elephants,' said one banker.
Last week also saw progress in the development of Hong Kong's domestic bond
market when the ADB raised HKDollars 1bn through an offering of eight-year
bonds, the largest issue to date in this market.
However, the development of this market is hampered by the tax situation in
Hong Kong which effectively limits the market to tax-exempt issuers, such as
supranational agencies. Pricing is also haphazard, due to the lack of
government bond benchmarks.

FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Alcan Aluminium shuffles board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES BOUGIE, 46, is taking over as chief executive of Alcan Aluminium
in a major senior management shake-up. He succeeds Mr David Morton.
Alcan is also reorganising its operations worldwide into five main groups
headed by five new executive vice-presidents.
Mr Allan Hodgson, who has been chief financial officer for 12 years and a
director, is leaving the company, as is Mr Ian Rugeroni, president of Alcan
Enterprises.
Mr Bougie joined Alcan in 1979 and in 1989 was hand-picked by Mr Morton to
be president and chief operating officer.
Mr Morton then took over as chairman and chief executive officer following
Mr David Culver's retirement. Mr Morton will continue as chairman of the
board.
The two men have led a company-wide retrenchment programme and have reduced
Alcan Aluminium's annual cost base by about USDollars 500m over the past
three years as world metal prices declined steadily with the North American
recession and then heavy CIS exports.
Alcan says it does not see any turnround in view and the organisational
shake-up is clearly designed to cut costs further and improve profitability.
'Alcan can be an even lower-cost producer by focusing on businesses where it
has the competitive edge,' said Mr Morton.
Alcan is studying its worldwide operation and any cutbacks required to meet
new goals will be made at the operating level.
The new executive vice-presidents are: Robert Ball, 47, Northern American
rolled products, Claude Chamberland, 53, smelting and power, Robert Fox, 57,
raw materials, S. Bruce Heister, 55, Asia Pacific, and Everaldo Santos, 54,
fabricated products.
Reinhold Wagner, 61, will be executive vice-president, rolled products,
Europe. Mr Hodgson is succeeded by Suresh Thadhani, 54, now controller.

FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Travelers to double asset
disposals to Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELERS, the US insurer which agreed to a bid last week from Mr Sanford
Weill's financial services group Primerica, will double the pace of its
property disposals by shedding more than Dollars 2bn of troubled assets next
year.
Mr Weill said he plans to reduce the insurer's distressed property portfolio
to Dollars 2bn or less by the end of 1994, from Dollars 4.3bn now, a move
that would mark an early rehabilitation for one of the US's biggest
composite insurers. Referring to the plan, he said: 'If that happens, the
problems will be behind us.'
Mr Weill was speaking at the end of last week, shortly after the Travelers'
board accepted an all-paper bid from Primerica worth Dollars 4.2bn for the
remaining 73 per cent of the company it does not already own.
Travelers expects to sell Dollars 1bn of distressed property assets in all
this year. The acceleration of this programme reflects the greater capital
resources available through the takeover by Primerica.
In anticipation of the benefits from the takeover, the main US credit rating
agencies last week said they would consider upgrading the insurer's credit
ratings.
The stockmarket also responded positively to the news, pushing up the
combined market value of the two companies by the end of last week to
Dollars 17.2bn, roughly the same as American Express, the US's biggest
financial services group.
Mr Weill, who has sat on Travelers' board since completing the purchase of
27 per cent of its shares at the beginning of this year, suggested there
would be little overlap between the insurance company and the rest of the
group.
'We didn't buy Travelers because of the synergies, but because it will be a
good business in its own right,' he said. He added, though, that a review
was under way to see whether any of Travelers' investment products could be
sold through the 10,500-strong retail brokerage network run by Smith Barney
Shearson, also part of Primerica.
The takeover was more likely to boost revenues by improving Travelers'
credit ratings, Mr Weill said. A stronger credit rating would help to
attract substantially more life insurance business, since customers tended
to be drawn to insurance companies which looked as though they would survive
long into the future, he said.
Mr Weill also suggested that the Travelers takeover would mark the
culmination of his plans to create a diversified financial services group.
'We have no thoughts of any significant acquisitions at this stage,' he
said, pointing to the spread of the proposed new group's earnings.
He also added that, although each unit within the new group will be run
independently, there were big cultural differences between the operations
which would take time to overcome. Besides Travelers and Smith Barney
Shearson, the US's second biggest retail stockbroker, the new group would
have Dollars 140bn under management, making it the fifth biggest fund
manager in the US.

<TEXT>
LVMH, the French company which is one the world's largest luxury goods
groups, may expand its media interests by making further investments in
French newspapers.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, said the group was 'ready to examine
other opportunities' having recently ventured into the newspaper field by
buying La Tribune Desfosses, the financial daily.
The chairman said that it would take 'between three and five years' to bring
the loss-making La Tribune to a satisfactory level of profitability.
However, he said the group was ready 'to play its part in ensuring that the
French press stayed in French hands'.
LVMH is under pressure in its traditional luxury market, particularly in its
champagne and cognac businesses. The group has warned that net profits might
fall in 1993 following a 28 per cent decline in profits to FFr935m during
the first half of the year.
Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, has announced that its
FFr2.7bn share and warrants issue was around three times oversubscribed. The
company issued 6.2m shares at FFr434 each.

FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian insurer shows first-half
improvement

<TEXT>
RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta, Italy's second-biggest private insurance
group, confirmed the marked upturn in insurers' underwriting performance
with first half pre-tax profits of L246.5bn (Dollars 155m) against L110.4bn
in 1992.
Higher taxation attenuated the improvement at the net level, with an
increase to L113.4bn from L97.1bn last year. That is well above the L95bn
RAS made in the whole of 1992, when earnings were hit by a steep write-down
in its investment portfolio.
Group premiums for RAS's Italian operation and its 14 foreign subsidiaries,
not adjusted for last year's lira devaluation, rose 16.9 per cent to
L4,198bn.
RAS said earnings on both underwriting and investments had performed well.
Although the motor side, to which it is among the most heavily exposed of
Italy's insurers, continued to register underwriting losses for compulsory
third party policies, the overall claims ratio improved.
Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailing group, said pre-tax profits for the
first half rose to L25.3bn from L19.3bn, in spite of the recession, which
has depressed retail sales.
Group turnover climbed by 12.3 per cent to L2,509.9bn from L2,234.5bn, well
ahead of the 1.8 per cent increase across the Italian retailing sector.
The bulk of the rise was attributable to Rinascente's growing hypermarket
and supermarket chain, which recorded a 17.4 per cent jump in sales to
L1,636.4bn. Sales in non-food retailing reported a more contained increase
of almost 4 per cent to L873.5bn.
Rinascente said it was pushing ahead with new store openings and expected to
open one new hypermarket and a number of additional specialist outfits
before the end of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in the demand for steel and its price forced Cockerill Sambre,
the Belgian steelmaker, into loss in the first half of 1993.
The company announced a net loss of BFr3bn (Dollars 85m) for the first six
months of the year, compared with a profit of BFr1.3bn in the equivalent
period. It suffered a reduction in activity in the principal markets -
automotive, construction and distribution - of up to 20 per cent.
Prices had firmed following the 'catastrophic fall' in the first quarter of
1993, but the group could not count on an increase in volume in the months
to come. As a result, Cockerill warned it was likely to record a similar
loss in the second half of the year.
Turnover dropped from BFr90.3bn to BFr76.3bn and cashflow from BFr7bn to
BFr1.7bn. However, the group pointed out that group net debt was still only
BFr5.9bn, compared with BFr4.7bn at the end of December.

listings

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has called on the US to allow German companies to be listed on
American stock markets on the strength of German style balance sheets and
profit and loss accounts.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
treasury secretary, that German companies did not wish to follow
Daimler-Benz and be obliged to produce both German and US accounts to obtain
listings on US exchanges.
In talks over the weekend, Mr Waigel said US companies were able to obtain
listings in Germany. It should be possible for German companies to be quoted
on US markets.
A German banker warned that without a change in US policy, other German
companies were unlikely to follow Daimler-Benz, and no German bank would
publish US accounts to get a US listing.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank's managing board, said he
favoured mutual recognition of different countries' accounting rules to
solve the problem. In his talk with Mr Waigel, Mr Bentsen promised to review
the situation and raise the matter with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission but warned that the SEC was an independent organisation.
In a letter last week to the Wall Street Journal, Mrs Mary Schapiro, SEC
commissioner, strongly defended US insistence that foreign companies should
conform with the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) when
seeking a US market listing. But she underlined that the SEC's adherence to
the standards was not arbitrary and it had accommodated deviations on a
case-by-case basis.
The difference between the standards was highlighted when Daimler-Benz
published two sets of accounts in preparation for a New York Stock Exchange
listing. The US accounts showed it a loss of DM949m in the first half, while
under German rules it reported a profit of DM168m.

raise up to ADollars 325m (USDollars 213m) through a convertible preference
issue - a key move in the group's efforts to tackle its ADollars 1bn-plus
debt burden.
TNT said it would issue 194m convertible preference shares at ADollars 1.55
apiece, and that oversubscriptions of up to 16m shares, raising another
ADollars 25m, would also be accepted. The preference shares will carry a
coupon of 8 per cent, and there will be mandatory conversion into ordinary
shares no later than May 31, 1997.
The new stock will be sold to both institutional and private investors.
About ADollars 225m of the issue will go to institutional clients of
underwriters - County NatWest Australia Securities and Macquaries
Underwriting - while private investors will be entitled to the remainder of
the offer and the oversubscription option. Existing holders of TNT shares
will have priority, provided that they are not also participating in the
institutional offer.
TNT will use the money to pay down some of its sizeable borrowings. The net
balance sheet debt stood at ADollars 1.12bn at end-June, and this figure
should be cut to around ADollars 831m after the preference share offer.
TNT has seen major boardroom upheavals recently - including the departure of
Sir Peter Abeles. For its last financial year, to end-June, TNT announced a
ADollars 256.7m loss after tax and abnormal items - although the hefty
deficit resulted partly from write-downs and provisions. At the operating
level, TNT returned to a small profit of ADollars 14.2m.
Australian National Industries, the heavy engineering group, is investing in
a joint venture with Amur Steel, a Russian group, to produce and market
steel and steel-related products for Russian and international markets.
The venture will be controlled by Amur, with a 53 per cent equity stake,
while ANI will hold 21 per cent. Parmelia Resources, an Australian resource
company based in Perth, will own the remaining 26 per cent. ANI's investment
 -comprising both loans and the equity investment - will amount to about
USDollars 12m.
ANI-Amurstal Joint Venture (AAJV) will utilise steel-making facilities at
the Amurstal Steel Works, at Komsomolsk in the Khabarovsk district of the
Russian Far East. The works date back to 1942 and the mini-mill has an
annual steel-making capacity of 1.2m tonnes.

FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Slight fall at Breedon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Breedon, the limestone quarrying and housebuilding group,
slipped by Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 960,000 in the six months to July 31,
while turnover edged up from Pounds 4.94m to Pounds 5.05m.
Directors said Breedon had concentrated on high volume stone sales at the
lower end of the quality market which had enabled it to prepare working
faces in readiness for the industry moving out of recession. Indications
were that house prices were stabilising, they added.
The interim dividend is held at 1.75p, payable from earnings per share of
2.26p (2.45p).

SERVOMEX, the gas analysis instrument maker, announced a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 747,000 for the half year ended June 30.
Mr Terry Clements, chairman, said that trading conditions had remained
unsettled in almost all its markets but the group had held its business
volume close to the 1992 level. The 12 per cent increases in the order and
sales levels arose from the combination of exchange and price effects, he
said. Turnover was Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 9.68m).
Earnings per share fell to 4.8p (7p) but the interim dividend is held at
1.9p.

FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Control Techniques restates cash flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL TECHNIQUES, the Powys-based electronic drives group, has been
required to re-state the cash flow figures in its 1992 annual report after
discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts
watchdog.
In an unusual move following an examination of its accounts by the panel,
the company has circulated amended numbers in a statement on Topic, the
Stock Exchange news service, to correct what it calls a 'classification
error'.
The accounts for the year to September 30 1992 wrongly showed the cash
impact of the disposal of two subsidiaries under FRS 1, the accounting
standard on the format of the cash flow statement.
This had the effect of incorrectly showing the company with a net inflow
before financing of Pounds 100,000, while the amended version shows it with
a net outflow of Pounds 1.14m for the year. Control said the change had no
impact on the 1992 profit and loss account or balance sheet figures.
The error was not picked up by the Birmingham office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand
which approved the 1992 accounts without qualification. It charged Pounds
199,000 for its audit during the year and a further Pounds 117,000 for other
services.
Coopers, the UK's largest accountancy firm, said: 'It was a complex standard
being applied for the first time. A technical error was made but it wasn't
material and it has been corrected. There was a mistake. Everybody accepts
that.'
The original cash flow statement showed Pounds 1.39m in proceeds from the
sale of Control Techniques Process Instruments and the Thermosensors segment
of Control Techniques Process Systems.
But it failed to exclude the elements of working capital of the businesses
sold in the reconciliation from operating profit to net cash flow from
operating activities in a note required by FRS 1.

FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Details of first rival to Zovirax revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS ABOUT the first competitor to Zovirax, the best-selling product of
Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, were revealed yesterday.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, presented clinical
data showing its new drug famciclovir was safe, and was as effective as
Zovirax while requiring less frequent dosing.
Zovirax, an anti-herpes treatment also used against shingles, had worldwide
sales last financial year of Pounds 586m, making it the world's eighth
best-selling medicine. Brokers Morgan Stanley expect its sales to reach
Pounds 1.3bn by 1997.
The drug, which represents 34 per cent of Wellcome's sales, has had no
competitor during the 12 years since its launch because of the difficulties
of developing non-toxic anti-herpes remedies.
Although SmithKline Beecham's drug is no more effective than Zovirax, the
data is significant because of the Anglo-American group's recent aggressive
pricing strategy. The group, the world's leading antibiotic company, also
has a far larger salesforce than Wellcome, particularly in the US.
Wellcome is developing a successor to Zovirax called valaciclovir. It is
presenting data in New Orleans next month that shows the drug is more
effective than Zovirax and requires less frequent dosing.
SmithKline Beecham expects to file dossiers with regulatory authorities
first for shingles, which represents between a third and a half of Zovirax
sales.
The company also plans to file for genital herpes, including primary
attacks, recurrent episodes and as a maintenance treatment to prevent herpes
outbreaks. It is also hoping to develop the product for treating cold sores
at a later date.
The dossier for shingles was given to the US Food and Drug Administration in
June and has been given to 18 other countries.
The first trial, presented at the European Academy of Dermato-Venereology in
Copenhagen, compared famciclovir and Zovirax in shingles patients and
demonstrated SmithKline Beecham's drug was as effective as Wellcome's.
Famciclovir was tested in 798 patients at doses of 750mg, 500mg and 250mg
three times a day against Zovirax at 800mg five times a day, its present
recommended regimen for shingles patients.
The trials showed that famciclovir at all three doses was as effective as
Zovirax, but did not have any marked benefit over Wellcome's drug.
The second trial is designed to test the safety of the the drug and compares
famciclovir with a placebo in 419 patients. The trial shows no statistical
difference in side effects between patients on the drug and placebo.
The results come as a relief to SmithKline Beecham. Many drugs in the same
class of Zovirax and famciclovir have had to be dropped because of their
toxicity.
Zovirax will also soon face competition from a Japanese drug, sorivudine,
which has been developed by Nippon Shoji Kaisha.

FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Aer Lingus restructuring
conflict deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICT OVER a restructuring plan at Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline,
deepened over the weekend after last Friday's deadline expired for a
voluntary redundancy scheme with only about half of the 1,280 voluntary
redundancies being sought by management having been taken up by the
airline's workforce.
The company is not expected to give a final figure for the take-up until
early this week, but it is widely believed to be no more than 750. The
original 5pm deadline was stretched until late on Friday night to allow
latecomers to get within the scheme.
The company is currently losing some IPounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.1m) a week, and
is seeking to cut IPounds 50m from its annual operating costs of about
IPounds 600m.
Some IPounds 34m is being sought in payroll cuts, through a combination of
redundancies in the 5,500 workforce and cutbacks in wage scales if necessary
for those that remain.
The company has said it is prepared to consider alternative ways of
achieving savings, as long as these can meet the target.
SIPTU, the trade union representing most of the workforce, advised its
members earlier in the week that the voluntary redundancy terms were the
best they were likely to get. It has warned that it will fight compulsory
redundancies, however, which could lead to a serious division within the
coalition government.
The Labour party, the junior partner in the coalition, made firm electoral
pledges last year that there would be no compulsory redundancies at Aer
Lingus in any restructuring plan and SIPTU now expects Labour to honour
those pledges.
The company has said that if it is forced to resort to compulsory
redundancies, these are likely to be at statutory levels which would amount
to only a tenth of what is offered under the voluntary scheme which offered
up to two and half times an employee's annual salary in severance payments.
The scheme is to be financed out of a IPounds 175m equity injection promised
by the government, but which is itself conditional upon EC approval. A
decision from Brussels is expected early in October.
The government has made it clear that if a viable recovery plan was not
forthcoming from the airline and its workforce, then the equity injection
would not be forthcoming either.
An October 31 deadline has been set by the Labour Relations Commission,
which is mediating in the dispute, for a definitive restructuring plan to be
agreed.
The emphasis in negotiations between management and unions is now likely to
shift to wage cuts to avoid compulsory redundancies, but SIPTU is insisting
that any cuts should be matched by creating an equity stake for the
workforce. This will mean that the government will also now be dragged into
the negotiations, as it is the sole owner of the airline.
An offer of a 5 per cent equity stake was rejected by SIPTU last week as
being 'totally inadequate'.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Amstrad looks for chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHIEF executive is being sought for Amstrad, the consumer electronics
group which led the UK personal computer boom in the 1980s but since slipped
into loss.
The move is designed to strengthen the company's day-to-day management and
give Mr Alan Sugar, the Amstrad founder and chairman, greater freedom to
concentrate on company strategy. Mr Sugar, the dominant figure in the
organisation, currently combines the role of chairman and chief executive.
The new appointment will result in his taking a less direct role in the
running of the company, which will be in the hands of the new appointee and
Mr Malcolm Miller, one of Mr Sugar's most trusted lieutenants.
Critics of the company's corporate governance argue too much power rests in
Mr Sugar's hands. They were angry last year when he failed to take the
company private through a 30p a share offer. He has since gone some way to
mollifying them by appointing two non-executive directors and seeking a
third.
Amstrad shares closed at 42p on Friday.
The decision to appoint a chief executive is part of a broad package of
measures to revitalise the company which Mr Sugar will announce with
Amstrad's 1992-1993 results, due next month.
He had already hinted he was planning a shake-up when he announced the
Pounds 6.4m acquisition earlier this month of Dancall Radio, a loss-making
Danish cordless telephone company.
Among changes likely as a result are:
A stronger emphasis on telecommunications, including mobile telephony, to
complement the company's successful drive into satellite communications. The
satellite business now accounts for 30 per cent of revenues, while video
systems accounts for 20 per cent.
Mr Miller is expected to manage the consumer electronics company and will
work with the new chief executive on new ventures and acquisitions.
A move away from personal computers (PCs) as the heart of the company's
business. PCs were at one time Amstrad's most profitable line, accounting
for more than 70 per cent of revenues, but intense price competition and
heavy research and development costs have cut profit margins to the point
where it is hard for groups like Amstrad to compete with US market leaders
like Compaq or Dell.
Now PCs account for less than 40 per cent of turnover. The company lost
Pounds 71m last year and is likely to report a further loss this year.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Wielding the knife with politicians at his elbow: Paul Betts
and John Ridding talk to the head of the French carrier about his plans to
reawaken the sleeping giant and return it to profit by 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am not a magician,' sighs Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, as he
contemplates the balancing act he will have to perform to implement his new
recovery plan for the loss-making French national flag carrier. His target
is to return it to profit by 1995.
The task has been made all the more difficult by the conflicting demands of
his government shareholder, anxious to see the airline in the black before
privatisation - but without provoking any serious industrial or political
backlash at a time of growing unemployment in France.
Even if Mr Attali succeeds, he has no guarantee that he will keep his job.
Appointed by the former socialist government four years ago, his position
has looked precarious since the centre-right returned to power in March.
Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister, said last week that the government
would judge Mr Attali on the results of his recovery plan.
But he would not commit himself further on the future of the Air France
chairman.
Although under increasing pressure from the government, Mr Attali - twin
brother of Mr Jacques Attali, former head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development - said he continued to have good relations
with his state shareholder.
The government was closely consulted over the new recovery programme.
Faced with record losses of FFr3.8bn (Pounds 430m) in the first half of this
year, a much deeper than expected domestic recession and continuing
discounting and over- capacity in the world airline market, Mr Attali said
the airline had no alternative but to accelerate the pace of restructuring
and reduce its costs.
His third and most radical recovery plan in as many years will involve an
additional 4,000 job cuts on top of the 4,600 already shed; a further FFr8bn
reduction in new aircraft investment; more cuts in the airline's route
network - bringing the total number closed since 1989 to more than 160; the
sale of some non-core businesses, such as the Meridien hotels chain, and the
contracting out of several other activities.
Overall, the airline is aiming to cut FFr5.1bn from its annual costs by
1995, including FFr 3.4bn next year.
The most sensitive aspect of the plan is the job cuts. Faced with an
unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent and rising, the government has ordered
public sector companies to minimise job losses.
Cost-saving plans will be rejected if they do not make full use of measures
 -such as part-time working and early retirement - to be included in a jobs
package to be debated in parliament next month.
The government has imposed tough restrictions on compulsory redundancies in
state sector enterprises as part of its efforts to contain unemployment. Mr
Attali claimed this would not have a significant impact on the airline's
latest cost-cutting drive. 'We managed to make only 36 compulsory lay-offs
in our previous job-cutting programme, involving 4,600 people, and we again
expect to meet the bulk of our new target without resorting to involuntary
redundancies.'
The rewards of the programme are potentially substantial.
'Over a four-year period we will have reduced by 27 per cent our unit costs
in real terms. We've already cut them by 13 per cent, so we are half way
there,' he said.
High costs have long been the Achilles' heel of Air France. 'The airline was
probably less prepared than others for the prolonged recession and that is
why we have to step up our restructuring and cost-cutting efforts,' he
acknowledged.
But he claimed that during the last three years wide-ranging changes had
already been made to the company's structure and operations.
The first fundamental move by Mr Attali was to absorb UTA, the independent
French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the domestic airline. Together with
alliances with Sabena of Belgium, CSA of Czechoslovakia, Continental
Airlines of the US, Air Canada and Aeromexico, this has given Air France a
global network as comprehensive as those of British Airways or Lufthansa.
The second was to refocus the airline around its Paris hub of Charles de
Gaulle airport, cutting unprofitable and peripheral services to concentrate
on profitable strategic routes.
'You should not under-estimate what we have been doing. We are modernising
the company, getting to grips with costs and changing mentalities,' he said.
'Until four years ago, Air France had never made a single job cut in its
entire history.'
But he said the airline simply could not undertake sudden, violent Anglo
Saxon-style restructuring programmes. 'We are in France and we have our
political and social constraints which we must take into consideration.'
The airline's problems have been exacerbated by what Mr Attali calls 'three
big shocks coming all at the same time'. The first has been the recession in
France. 'It's been severe and we rely on the domestic market for about 45
per cent of our sales,' he said.
The second has been the onslaught of US airlines into the French market.
'We've had eight US carriers dumping prices into our market, while BA has
been protected from this because of the restrictive bilateral aviation
agreement between the UK and the US. I call that kind of bilateral the
equivalent of state aid.'
The third problem has been the general overcapacity in the market and Mr
Attali does not expect any improvement before 1995 or 1996.
That has left him with little choice but to launch his toughest recovery
programme. In what has clearly been a particularly fraught period for the
airline, Mr Attali has taken some consolation from a recent report on
European airlines by Lehman Brothers suggesting that there was 'great
potential' for Air France to become one of Europe's most successful airlines
 -but only if it seriously reduced its cost base.
'The sleeping giant, as some people have described us, is stirring,' Mr
Attali said.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Investcorp to control Gucci for Dollars 170m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTCORP, the Bahrain-based merchant bank, will today announce it has won
control of Gucci, one of the world's best-known luxury goods brands, in an
amicable solution to the battle for ownership.
Mr Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the founder, will sell his 50 per cent stake
to Investcorp, the only other shareholder, for about Dollars 170m (Pounds
110m). The price is slightly more than the Dollars 160m paid by Investcorp
to buy its holding in the booming late 1980s.
Analysts expect Investcorp to move quickly to recapitalise Gucci and prepare
it either for flotation or sale to a bigger luxury goods concern. The bank
has already acquired a portfolio of luxury goods companies, including
Tiffany, which has been floated, Chaumet and Saks 5th Avenue.
Mr Gucci will cut all links with the group, established 70 years ago.
However, in a surprise twist, he is expected to be appointed as a special
consultant to Investcorp for its luxury goods activities. The appointment
also offers the two sides a face-saving solution to the bitter war of words
of recent months.
In July, Investcorp obtained a temporary freeze on Mr Gucci's stake.
Claiming Mr Gucci was mis-managing the company, it also instigated formal
arbitration proceedings to resolve differences between the two shareholders.
Gucci's financial performance has suffered from the recession and the
inability of its shareholders to agree on policy. Sales fell to L225bn
(Pounds 93m) in the 1992-3 financial year ending January 31st from a peak of
L299bn in 1990-91.
Mr Gucci's attempts to restore the company's fortunes by concentrating on
traditional items and cutting the number of outlets helped reduce losses to
L25bn last year from a peak of L38bn in 1991-2.
However, Gucci is still experiencing financial difficulties with high
borrowings and continuing losses at its important US subsidiary.
While stressing his commitment to the family business, Mr Gucci made clear
in July that he was open to offers.
Negotiations, which began soon after the legal action, were completed last
week.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Economics Notebook: The benefits as swords turn into
ploughshares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The peace dividend has turned out to be one of the more elusive promises of
the post-Cold War age.
Instead of immediate welfare gains from disarmament, industrialised
countries with large arms industries such as the US and Britain are in the
throes of difficult cuts in defence establishments with consequent job
losses among suppliers of military hardware.
Military cuts have been big news on both sides of the Atlantic over the past
year. In Britain, the struggle between the Devonport and Rosyth naval
dockyards to secure the order to refit Britain's Trident submarine fleet has
left a question mark over the long-term future of Rosyth, Scotland's biggest
industrial site.
When in March the US defence department recommended closing 31 big military
bases in the US and scaling back operations at 134 other sites, it was
calculated that 57,000 civilian and 24,000 military jobs would be lost.
With some commentators blaming defence cuts for slow and patchy growth in
the US and elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund has entered the debate
on the economic effects of reducing military spending.
In a special section of its latest World Economic Outlook, it concludes that
there are big gains to be made from turning swords into ploughshares.
The IMF's study is timely because cuts in defence spending are already
moving apace and the trend is expected to continue for some years to come.
IMF statistics suggest that military spending in the world, excluding the
countries of the former Soviet Union, fell by nearly a quarter to 3.1 per
cent of global gross domestic product in 1992 from 3.9 per cent in 1986.
As a result, world military spending amounted to Dollars 662bn (Pounds
429bn) in 1992.
If spending relative to GDP had stayed at 1986 levels, it would have been
Dollars 854bn. The fund projects a further decline to 2.3 per cent of GDP by
1998 with an especially sharp drop of 40 per cent in the US military
spending-to-output ratio.
The IMF's research shows that such spending cuts initially reduce economic
growth. But using a computer model, known as Multimod, to simulate the
effects of a 20 per cent reduction in all military spending carried out in
equal instalments over five years, it concludes that big gains accrue in the
medium and longer-term to the entire global economy.
The IMF chose a 20 per cent reduction over five years because it is broadly
comparable to the decline in military spending contained in its medium-term
projections.
In the case of the industrial countries, the simulation suggests that the
initial reduction in economic growth can be reversed by the second year. By
the sixth year, when the decreases in military spending have ceased, 'the
performance of the industrial countries is considerably improved'.
Looking further ahead, the IMF economists calculated that by the end of the
11th year, GDP in the industrialised countries would be Dollars 60bn (or 0.3
per cent higher) than it would have been with no military spending
reductions.
More significant for future welfare, consumption and investment would be up
by Dollars 144bn and Dollars 83bn or 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively
over the base line. Military spending, which rarely generates further
wealth, would be Dollars 170bn lower.
The remarkable thing about the IMF findings is that gains accrue to all
types of country.
The US, which at the end of the 1980s had military spending of 6 per cent of
GDP, predictably suffers an output drop for several years.
But after five years, the cuts are generating growth elsewhere so that the
cumulative output loss is only Dollars 7bn, a tiny amount compared with the
cumulative Dollars 250bn reduction in military spending.
After eleven years, US private consumption and investment are respectively
1.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent above baseline, suggesting that the US stands
to gain more from cuts in military spending than the average industrialised
country even though its military spending-to-GDP ratio was the largest in
the industrialised world just before the end of the Cold War.
Japan, with only a small arms industry and small military budget, gains from
lower military spending, although its benefits are less than those of the
US. Developing nations also gain from global military spending cuts.
All countries benefit because military spending cuts will create room for
other beneficial policy changes such as tax cuts and lower interest rates
which feed through into increased consumption and investment. There is also
a gain from increased volumes of international trade because the private
sector spending that replaces the military spending has a higher trade
component.
These trends have been simulated by the Multimod computer model which is a
multi-regional, rational expectations model in which expectations about
future behaviour feed back into exchange rates, interest rates, consumption
and investment.
In making their calculations, the IMF economists assumed that each nation
will also lower its military aid, imports and exports by 20 per cent.
Another assumption is that cuts in government consumption caused by the
military spending reductions were accompanied by tax cuts of a size to leave
government deficits unchanged.
The belief that governments will cut taxes in this way may be too sanguine,
given the fragile fiscal state of most industrial nations.
Another problem is that the IMF simulation does not analyse the consequences
of lower military spending for different sectors or regions. This means that
it cannot take account of hostile political reactions from threatened groups
that might make governments embark on outlays that are just as economically
unproductive as the curtailed military spending.
The full economic benefits of lower military spending are felt only if all
countries participate equally in the cuts. Logically, a 20 per cent
across-the-board reduction in spending should result in no loss of security
for the nations of the world. But the history of disarmament suggests that
persuading countries of this would be a monumental task.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Liffe to restart talks on joining Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFFE is to resume talks on joining Globex, the round-the-clock futures
trading system, after the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) yielded to pressure
from its Globex partners to give up its claim to a key Liffe product.
Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which developed the project
with the the CBOT, urged it to relinquish its right to trade bund futures,
the most heavily-traded contract on Liffe.
Globex, developed by Reuters, the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
urgently needs to attract other exchanges to list their futures contracts on
the electronic system, to boost trading volume.
The system is designed to allow futures trading to continue outside exchange
hours, but volume has consistently fallen short of targets since its launch
more than a year ago.
Liffe, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, pulled
out of negotiations last month, when the CBOT laid claim to bund futures.
Reuters has played a pivotal role in getting the negotiations going again.
While publicly declaring its long-term commitment to the project, Reuters
has been dissatisfied with the CBOT's handling of its talks with Liffe. 'We
believe the position on bund contracts you have taken with Liffe is
inconsistent with the Globex agreement,' a Reuters executive wrote in a
letter to CBOT chairman Mr Pat Arbor a week before Liffe discussions ended.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Attempts to reduce civil service staff levels fail: Rising
crime and EC changes force up numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT efforts to reduce civil service numbers appear to be failing,
according to figures to be published by the Treasury later this year. The
figures show that most civil service departments have increased their
payrolls in the last year, some by more than 5 per cent.
Numbers released to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee show a
slight increase in the number of staff in the civil service.
The figures show 554,212 civil servants on April 1 1993, compared with
565,319 a year earlier, a fall of 11,107. However, 6,320 of this decrease is
accounted for by the transfer of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment
into commercial management. Employees are no longer classified as civil
servants.
Another 5,100 staff left the civil service during the year as part of the
privatisation of PSA services, the government's property services agency.
If these two organisations are excluded from the comparison, the number of
civil servants in the rest of the service has risen by just over 300 in the
last year. In the previous year, the number rose by almost 11,500.
The biggest increase was in the Department of Social Security, up 6,547 to
84,824 staff. The department said it could not explain the 8 per cent rise
after three years in which staff numbers fell.
Rising crime is a factor behind increases at departments connected with law
and order, such as the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's department and the
Crown Prosecution Service. The Home Office said that many of the extra 1,631
staff on its payroll were employed in new prisons.
There have also been increases in regulatory departments such as Oftel and
Ofwat, and changes in the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy
are blamed for temporary surges in staff at the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Scottish Office. The rise in civil servants will almost certainly fuel
calls for the government to tighten public spending controls.
Several departments whose staff had increased in 1991-92 recorded falls last
year. These include the Education and Environment departments and the Inland
Revenue, which managed to cut more than 2,300 staff.
The Institute of Directors is calling for a 5 per cent reduction in public
service staff as a contribution towards cutting Pounds 20bn a year from
government spending.
Mr Quentin Davies, a Conservative backbencher on the Treasury and Civil
Service Committee, said the figures showed that ministers needed to set
targets for reducing the numbers of civil servants in their departments
He said: 'At a time when the private sector has made unprecedented progress
in increasing productivity, the civil service as a whole has actually
maintained constant numbers.'

FT  27 SEP 93 / Yeltsin at end of political life, says chief rival

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia is 'part of the old era' as surely as is
the Russian parliament whose defeat he is now overseeing, according to Mr
Grigory Yavlinsky, foremost of the declared challengers for the presidential
elections.
'He is preparing the way for the next generation of politicians - but he
himself is at the end of his political life,' said Mr Yavlinsky, the
prominent economist who last month emerged as Russia's 'most trusted'
politician in a nationwide opinion poll.
His remarks came as the parliament's resistance to its abolition seemed to
be weakening under an onslaught of decrees and orders from Mr Yeltsin
designed to bring it into line.
Mr Yavlinsky, 41, whose popularity does not seem to have been dented by the
events of recent days, declared himself a presidential candidate some months
ago, and has since been selling himself as a reformer, but of a new
political generation.
In an interview with the Financial Times at the end of last week, the
challenger said that in speeding the end of the old regime, President
Yeltsin was also hastening his own demise.
Just as former Soviet president Mr Mikhail Gorbachev brought about the end
of communism and fell with it, so Mr Yeltsin was opening the door for a new
wave of political figures in belatedly pushing through constitutional
reform.
Though other candidates have yet to come forward, Mr Yavlinsky's popularity,
based on a demotic style and a refusal to be aligned with any one group,
gives him an impressive lead.
He cites an opinion poll conducted in St Petersburg the day after Mr Yeltsin
dissolved parliament and convened elections to a bicameral assembly in
December. The poll shows him enjoying the support of 21.7 per cent, ahead of
Mr Yeltsin with just 19.7 per cent, and vice-president Alexander Rutskoi -
installed last week as president by parliament - in third place with 10.7
per cent.
Although he agrees the results are 'very preliminary', he says they show
'that people are sick and tired of this confrontation between parliament and
the president'.
As well as being the only declared opposition candidate with a firm grasp of
market economics, he has done more than any other Russian politician to
develop a coherent vision of the future.
His message to the electorate is based on three promises: the construction
of a genuine federal state, the protection of private property and a sound
currency.

FT  27 SEP 93 / State role in growth of east Asian economies questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL POLICIES to promote particular sectors or companies have been a
failure in east Asia and do not explain the region's rapid growth in recent
decades, according to a World Bank study.
The bank's findings counter the argument made by many economists that the
region's success reflects government intervention in the economy rather than
orthodox market-oriented policies.
'While there are some differences between countries, broadly speaking,
attempts to change industrial structure simply are not associated with rapid
growth,' said Mr John Page, the leader of the bank team. However, some
interventions in financial markets and to promote exports had been
successful.
The 380-page report on the 'east Asia miracle' concludes that aggressive
industrial policies failed to raise productivity growth in favoured sectors.
It says market forces would have brought about the changes in industrial
structure sought by governments without the need for public sector
intervention.
The bank study, the most exhaustive analysis of the east Asian miracle yet
published, says the region's success mainly reflects sound economic
fundamentals - conservative macroeconomic policies and much higher levels of
saving and investment than in other developing countries. The rapid growth
reflected a strong emphasis on primary and secondary education.
Per capita real growth in the eight most dynamic economies in east Asia  -
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand
 -has averaged 5.5 per cent a year since 1960, three times as fast as Latin
America and five times as fast as sub-Saharan Africa.
The bank study says some government interventions may have helped. Policies
to reduce the cost of capital and direct credit towards favoured industries
worked in some countries but not in others. Policies to promote exports,
which sometimes involved protection of the home market, were generally
successful in accelerating growth.
Mr Richard Richardson of the Overseas Development Council, a Washington
think tank, challenged the bank's findings. Industrial policy had worked in
Japan, he said. The bank was wrong to conclude that selective interventions
would not work elsewhere.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Gold shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Preparatory work for the new FT Gold Mines index, to be launched later this
year, has shown how markedly yields on South African gold stocks have fallen
in 1993. From a high of almost 11 per cent in January, yields fell below 4
per cent in July as bullion surged above Dollars 400 an ounce. Even more
importantly, the yield gap between South African gold shares and other
producers has also narrowed substantially. South African gold shares tend to
yield more than North American or Australian stocks, because they work on a
fixed mining site and are returning capital to shareholders as the mine
becomes exhausted, while others tend to retain the money in the business for
further prospecting. The political risk in South Africa also adds to the
yield.
In part the narrowing of yield is a natural response - gold shares are a
geared play on the bullion market. As the highest cost producer, South
African mines benefit disproportionately from a rising bullion price.
Besides, South African stocks were particularly depressed at the start of
the year, so the rise is somewhat unrepresentative. Since the index is
compiled in dollar terms, any rise in the bullion price which pushes up the
rand will tend to inflate its South African component. Yet since bullion has
fallen back, yields on South African shares have only risen slightly. That
implies some easing of the political risk premium, which may be further
reduced as sanctions are removed. The floundering bullion price will,
however, prove the final arbiter.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Housing market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Faith among builders in the housing market recovery seems to be gathering
momentum. Tarmac is the latest to ask shareholders for money to invest in
land. The worry is that the indicators show scant evidence of recovery so
far. Halifax's house price index shows no net gain since prices stopped
falling last October. The building society also accompanied its interim
figures with a comment that the market remains delicately poised. Even
allowing that its statement was tailored for political consumption ahead of
the budget, the implication is that investing in land now is risky.
Land prices are already rising faster than house prices. If that continues,
and building materials prices start to rise as well, house builders' margins
will be squeezed. True, the premium commanded by new houses over old has
dwindled in recession. In normal times the premium is around 15 per cent,
against an average of 7 per cent at present - not least because cash-starved
builders have been offering discounts to secure sales. New house prices thus
have some catching up to do. They might show something of a recovery even if
the market as a whole remains subdued. But that cannot be taken for granted.
If the enthusiasm of builders outstrips that of buyers, excess supply could
quickly emerge. With cash committed to new land and construction but little
flowing in from completed sales, the builders would again have to fight the
urge to discount.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders never really wanted to join the FT-SE 100 index, and last week's
share performance shows why. A net fall of 5 per cent on minimal turnover
and no news developments makes it an embarrassingly awkward member of such a
prestigious club. Its price is particularly volatile because the founding
family's controlling interest makes the stock chronically illiquid. On top
of that, Schroders' appalling disclosure record leaves the shares impossible
for even professional investors to value.
Changes in EC disclosure rules will force Schroders to deal with the latter
problem next year. Confronting the lack of liquidity is more difficult. It
makes Schroders an unsuitable candidate for the index. Yet exclusion would
smack of unfair discrimination - except as part of a general change to the
index rules on liquidity. At present these simply follow the stock exchange
listing requirement that 25 per cent of a company's shares be freely
tradeable. It would be a bold step for the index committee to depart from
this norm. And there is also the thorny problem of whether large
institutional shareholdings should count as part of the freely traded float.
A more subtle approach would be to exclude non-voting shares when market
capitalisation is calculated for index eligibility purposes. Again, stock
exchange rules do not discriminate in this way. But such an approach would
not only exclude an illiquid issue like Schroders. It would also serve the
socially useful purpose of putting additional pressure on others such as
Whitbread which persist with this archaic form of structure.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates to this year's International Monetary Fund meeting must be pleased
with the 30 per cent rise in the IFC's emerging market index over the past
year. Its advance provides ready enticement to industrial country fund
managers anxious to boost their return. Capital flows to the developing
world are soaring as a result. But as the fashion for emerging country
shares spreads ever wider, nagging worries surface about the risk of
overkill.
On technical grounds such concern looks premature. Emerging country
economies account for some 13 per cent of world GDP, while their stock
markets account for only 6 per cent of world market capitalisation. On this
basis, their shares look structurally undervalued. Moreover industrial
country institutions are relatively under-invested in emerging countries,
where markets respond to different factors than those at home. They still
have room to boost their return by diversifying into emerging markets
without increasing their overall portfolio risk.
Indeed the fashion for emerging markets may be driven by their increasing
liberalisation. Exclude from the IFC index markets closed to foreigners and
its gain is even more impressive. Foreign buying - or the prospect of it -
in markets that have liberalised is apparently fuelling gains in share
prices. The danger is to assume the progress is linear. No market is immune
from shock. Russian troubles could upset eastern Europe; a rise in US
interest rates would hit Asia. Worst of all would be a failure of the Gatt
which would both hit developing country growth prospects and undermine the
trend towards trade and investment liberalisation.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Milking the milk monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUNNY thing is happening in the UK's Pounds 3.3bn milk market. The Milk
Marketing Board's statutory monopoly on purchasing milk from farmers expires
next April. But instead of competitive forces leading to lower prices, it
seems certain that milk prices will rise. What is going wrong?
The explanation given by angry dairy companies is that the board is trying
to turn itself from a de jure milk purchasing monopoly into a de facto
supply monopoly. Its plan, to be submitted to government for approval in the
next couple of weeks, is to reorganise itself as the Milk Marque, a farmers'
co-operative.
Recent comments by Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque's chief executive, look
monopolistic. He has predicted that 80 per cent of the UK's 30,000 dairy
farmers will join Milk Marque and promised that the co-operative will use
its marketing muscle to secure farmers an additional 2p per litre - an
increase of almost 10 per cent. While dairy companies are free to cut their
own deals with farmers, they are finding they need to offer a premium of
0.5p to tempt farmers away from the Milk Marque, so driving prices yet
higher.
The dairy trade is concerned that price rises will either be passed through
to consumers or be accommodated by a squeeze on profits. To avoid this
danger, it wants the Milk Marketing Board split up into several competing
regional co-operatives.
Breaking the board up would certainly suit the large dairy companies by
increasing their bargaining power. But it is doubtful whether this would be
enough to prevent price rises because the main culprit is not the board's
monopoly but the European Community's quota regime, which has fixed UK milk
production at 85 per cent of domestic consumption. So long as supply is thus
restricted, it will be possible for dairy farmers to jack up their prices.
Rationing system
The current system, operating under government oversight, has sought to
balance the interests of farmers and the dairy trade. Prices have been
struck in annual negotiations between the board and the Dairy Trade
Federation, which represents the dairy companies. The problem of excess
demand has been dealt with by an elaborate rationing system, whereby liquid
milk suppliers get priority over companies wishing to process milk into
cheese, butter and other products.
In the new competitive world, Milk Marque will no longer seek to balance
interests but to get the best deal for its farmer members. The only cap on
increases will be the cost of buying milk in continental countries such as
the Netherlands or Denmark, which have excess supplies of milk. This is
expensive because of transportation costs, but these should fall when the
Channel Tunnel opens.
Ideal solution
The ideal solution would be to scrap the EC milk quota system.
Unfortunately, there is little chancing of achieving this in the medium
term, since last year's reform of the Community's Common Agricultural Policy
agreed that quotas should last until at least 2000. But this is not an
excuse for the government to sit by idly as milk prices rise. Action is
needed both at European and national levels.
In Europe, ministers should press for quotas to be tradeable across national
frontiers. This would allow British farmers, who have some of Europe's best
land for dairy farming, to buy quotas from other countries so reducing the
gap between domestic supply and consumption. The European Court of Auditors
has already backed this idea.
At home, the best approach would be to break the Milk Marketing Board into
competing regional co-operatives. This would ensure that dairy companies had
a range of suppliers, limiting the danger that they could be put in
take-it-or-leave-it situations. Competition would also give the board's
successors an incentive to cut administrative costs.
It would be unrealistic to expect a break-up to do more than dampen price
rises. So long as supplies are restricted, farmers will be able to increase
prices and enjoy monopoly rents. Since such a transfer of revenue from
consumers to producers would be totally arbitrary, the government might
consider imposing a special tax to claw back excess profits.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Sights set on a wider world: The imperatives guiding
America's hesitant foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 11.30 this morning, New York time, Bill Clinton will become the 10th US
president to take the rostrum in the UN General Assembly. Like his
predecessors, he will use the occasion to explain his administration's
policies to the world but, even more, his words will be aimed at public
opinion within the US.
The US has made abundant use of the UN as an instrument of its foreign
policy in recent years, and the Clinton administration is committed to the
UN ideologically in a way that its Republican predecessors were not. Yet at
the same time the UN is suffering an acute financial crisis, caused in large
part by the fact that the US is falling further and further behind with its
contributions. For the fiscal year that starts this Friday, the Clinton
administration requested funding based on the UN budget as it stood last
January, since when UN peacekeeping commitments have expanded dramatically.
Congress, however, has cut the appropriation by 5 per cent.
Severely embarrassed by this, the US delegation is hoping today's speech
will mark the start of an intensive lobbying effort to get Congress to take
the UN more seriously. But any such effort will have to be part of a much
broader campaign to explain the connection between the US's foreign policy
commitments and the interests of individual US citizens.
The speech comes as the climax of a series given by Mr Clinton's senior
foreign policy advisers last week, in which they showed themselves well
aware of the need for such a campaign. On Monday the secretary of state,
Warren Christopher, kicked off with a speech devoted mainly to the Middle
East, seeking to exploit the remarkable windfall of an Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement which had dropped on to the White House lawn a week earlier.
He was followed on Tuesday by Tony Lake, the national security adviser, who
attempted a broader definition of the administration's goals, stressing that
cold war 'containment' of communism had now been replaced by 'enlargement'
of the 'community of market democracies'.
Finally on Thursday Madeleine Albright, ambassador to the UN and a cabinet
member, sought to reassure an audience at the US National War College that
future UN peacekeeping or 'peacemaking' operations would be subject to
strict criteria, and that the president was still prepared to use US forces
unilaterally when necessary 'to protect America and Americans'.
The common thread running through these speeches was an argument on two
fronts. All three speakers showed themselves acutely aware that their most
articulate critics at the moment are not isolationists but foreign policy
specialists, mostly associated with previous Republican administrations.
These people fully accept that the US retains important interests abroad,
but worry that Mr Clinton is jeopardising those interests by subordinating
his freedom of action to multilateral structures, the most important being
Nato and the UN.
Bosnia is at the centre of the argument. Differences over Bosnia have put
Nato under considerable strain, as any European diplomat will tell you. But
not enough strain to satisfy William Safire, the former Nixon speechwriter
turned New York Times columnist, who thinks Mr Clinton should have reminded
Europeans 'that rejection of American leadership on Bosnia has consequences
for Nato'.
The UN comes in for even more stick. Among the factors inhibiting US policy
on Bosnia have been the fear of Russian or Chinese vetoes in the Security
Council, and the presence of UN forces on the ground which are engaged in a
humanitarian mission but unable (or unwilling) to halt military operations
and genocidal 'ethnic cleansing'. The final straw for many commentators came
in early August when the UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros Ghali,
appeared to claim a right of veto over air strikes which Nato, under strong
US pressure, had at last agreed to threaten.
Such criticisms are echoed by some career diplomats within the state
department, and they have clearly got under the administration's skin. Last
week's speeches were notably defensive about 'multilateralism', and designed
to rebut any accusation of wimpishness. (Ms Albright recalled, for instance,
that in June the president ordered a unilateral attack on Baghdad in
response to Iraq's attempt on the life of his predecessor.) But they were
also a clarion call to all who favour an active foreign policy, seeking to
rally them under the banner of internationalism.
The argument between unilateralists and multilateralists, Mr Lake suggested,
is really a false quarrel, or at most a dispute about tactics. Both sides
agreed that the US had important interests abroad, he said, and in its
defence of them it should be pragmatic about the choice of unilateral or
multilateral instruments. But, he went on, 'there is a more fundamental
foreign policy challenge brewing . . . over whether we will be significantly
engaged abroad at all'.
Mr Clinton likes to compare the present period of international relations
with that which followed 1945, when his Democratic predecessor, Harry S
Truman, responded to an entirely new strategic context by forging a fresh
set of alliances and multilateral institutions under US leadership. To do so
he had to overcome resistance from both Democrats and Republicans who wanted
to keep the US free from peacetime 'entanglements', as it had traditionally
been.
'The internationalists,' recalled Mr Lake, 'won those debates, in part
because they could point to a unitary threat to America's interests and
because the nation was entering a period of economic security. Today's
supporters of engagement abroad have neither of those advantages. The
threats and opportunities are diffuse, and our people are deeply anxious
about their economic fate.'
The irony is, of course, that this public mood was one of the main factors
that brought Mr Clinton to power in the first place. The most widely echoed
criticism of George Bush was that he appeared obsessed with foreign affairs
and neglected the economy, while Mr Clinton's campaign workers constantly
reminded themselves that the issue which mattered was 'the economy, stupid'
 -and the third candidate, Mr Ross Perot, who played a significant role in
Mr Bush's defeat, was even more outspoken in urging that the time had come
for America to put its own interests first.
Mr Clinton himself was never an isolationist. He never suggested that
foreign policy was unimportant, or that the US should abandon its overseas
commitments. Rather his theme was that domestic economic problems now could
and should be given top priority, and that in a complex and interdependent
world foreign policy could no longer be treated as a specialist's topic.
Domestic and foreign, geopolitical and economic issues: all were now
inextricably intertwined, and what was needed was an integrated approach in
which foreign policy would take its place as part of an overall strategy for
guaranteeing the security of present and future generations of Americans.
Put like that, the proposition is hard to dispute, and Mr Clinton the
'policy wonk', with his formidable grasp of detail across a broad range of
issues, was well placed to put this approach into practice. He is described,
by a foreign ambassador who has been able to observe him at close quarters,
as 'one of the most intelligent current political leaders' on the world
stage; and he has brought with him into government a formidable array of
intellectuals who have been honing their brains and refining their ideas in
think-tanks and universities during the long years of opposition.
The effort to rethink issues and produce coherent strategies for new
situations is real, and impressive. Great trouble has been taken to
co-ordinate the thinking and activities of different departments, and the
turf battles which produced so much incoherence in both the Carter and
Reagan administrations (less so under Mr Bush) have up to now been largely
avoided.
Mr Gordon Adams, for instance, at the Office of Management and Budget, makes
no distinction between the budgets for defence, energy, peacekeeping (which
comes under the state department), or the Agency for International
Development. To him this is all money spent on security.
The 'bottom-up review' of US defence needs, published by defence secretary
Les Aspin on September 1, is generally regarded as rather conservative but
is also given credit for being intellectually honest - 'as our defence
reviews never are', in the words of one rueful British observer. That is to
say, it is genuinely 'bottom-up', in the sense that it first defines the
tasks and then argues from them to the force levels required, rather than
being designed to justify a particular level of expenditure. Whether the
money to sustain those force levels will actually be found, especially when
the full costs of the proposed healthcare reform are recognised, is another
matter, on which Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs
committee, has serious doubts.
What no one disputes is that this is a serious administration which takes
foreign policy seriously. A comment heard repeatedly in Washington earlier
this month was that it performs well when working to a deadline. It set
itself to produce a package of aid for reform in Russia before the
Clinton-Yeltsin summit in April; to articulate a China policy before June 3,
when China's most favoured nation status had to be renewed by Congress; to
produce a broader Asian policy; and a negotiating strategy for the Uruguay
Round, before the Tokyo summit.
It has now got its act together on the North American Free Trade Agreement -
although many fear this will prove to be too late, since Mr Perot and the
labour unions have achieved such a grip on public opinion in the meantime.
And the hope is that by January 10, when Mr Clinton comes to Europe for a
Nato summit convened by himself, it will also have produced a clear
blueprint for the future of the Atlantic alliance.
This poses a real dilemma. It is widely argued in Washington that Nato will
lose its relevance unless it is seen to extend security eastwards into
central Europe; yet many fear that to enlarge Nato's membership would mean
giving unfulfillable guarantees to unstable new democracies, and in the
process offer a propaganda boon to paranoid anti-western forces in Russia.
One senior administration official admitted to me, however, that 'what
really matters is Bosnia'. If by January 10 Nato was 'there, and doing
something', the summit would be a success. But if 'Sarajevo has gone down
the tubes', it would be a failure. No doubt it will depend on some other
unforeseeable events, too, such as the outcome of the power struggle in
Russia. The weakness of the administration's 'think-tank' approach to
policy-making is, precisely, that it does not facilitate quick or decisive
reactions to uexpected events. A problem like Bosnia, and perhaps still less
Russia, cannot be relied on to sit still while six committees of brilliant
political scientists hammer out a policy statement, writing incisive minutes
in the margins of each other's drafts; or while the president conducts a
thoughtful and well-informed debate with himself in the presence of his
advisers, or sometimes of astonished journalists.
Mr Clinton is devoting a great deal of his time to foreign policy - more
than he likes to admit. The week before last, for instance, he telephoned
almost every EC head of government to urge on them the importance of
preserving the Blair House agreement on agriculture if the Uruguay Round was
not to be scuppered. He is as aware as anyone that America's economic
interests and national security are closely tied to the maintenance of an
open trading system and a free and orderly world.
But, as Mr Lake recognised, it is much harder for him to persuade the
American public that this requires a big investment of American resources
than it was for Harry Truman to do the same at the start of the cold war. In
today's speech Mr Clinton has to find a way of making the point without
seeming to betray his campaign promise to put domestic affairs first.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Way ahead for the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS DEBATE on European Community economic policy has at last begun. Such
a debate may not lead to a sound conclusion. But it is an excellent start.
Of nothing is this more true than monetary arrangements.
When the ERM was partially dismembered a year ago, the official reaction of
the EC was that the system was fine. The problem, it was argued, lay with
inept management, exacerbated by the unfortunate consequences of German
unification. That position looks far less credible today.
Some, it is true, believe that the ERM was mugged by Anglo-Saxon
speculators. But that view cannot be defended. As Sir Leon Brittan argued
last Friday, 'the difficulties experienced all the way from black Wednesday
in September 1992 to the August decision to widen ERM bands, arose from the
incompatibility of free capital movements, fixed exchange rates and
independent monetary policies.'
Where Sir Leon goes wrong is in his subsequent statement that 'if we had
followed the system as it was originally envisaged and allowed parities to
change . . . we would have avoided our present difficulties.' As the
governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, argued last Wednesday,
'prompt parity adjustment is not at all easy to achieve in practice . . .
Prompt adjustment is anyway something of a contradiction, when the
reasonably stout defence of existing parities is seen as an intrinsic part
of the ERM's function as an external discipline.'
Survive attack
More fundamentally, knowledge that exchange rates can be changed undermines
the credibility they need to survive attack. As the governor remarked, the
remedy of more timely adjustment could merely 'come to mean more frequent
exchange rate crises', as investors seek to jump the gun.
There are four intellectually defensible possibilities: for some member
states to jump to economic and monetary union; to move to a pure float; to
return to narrow bands, while constraining currency speculation; or to
manage the new wide-band ERM.
The first of these is intellectually defensible, not for all 12 member
states, but for a narrower core, which could include Germany, the Benelux
countries and France. Denmark could join if it wanted to. Austria and
Switzerland could join if they were within the EC. The second option, though
still less popular, is also defensible. In practice, however, neither
alternative is politically conceivable at present.
The third possibility always has supporters. When speculators show that a
government has no policy clothes, the first reaction is to try to put them
in irons. The president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, has
already suggested capital controls, be it a ring fence around the EC or
special deposits on borrowing for currency speculation.
Argue forcefully
Both Sir Leon and the governor argue forcefully against such ideas. The
danger is that such interventions would, if effective, undermine the single
market that currency stability is intended to defend. In addition, should it
be made easier for governments to persist with misaligned exchange rates or
inappropriate monetary policies?
When what is impossible is eliminated what is left, however improbable, must
be chosen. By luck or by inspiration, the EC has fallen upon a perfectly
sensible exchange rate system.
As the governor notes, rules for a sensible domestic policy are given by the
Maastricht Treaty's convergence requirements. As Sir Leon notes, the
preconditions for a co-operative monetary policy are also given by the
treaty. What the EC should do is agree on a sensible monetary policy for
each of its members, defined against the goal of non-inflationary growth.
Countries should be encouraged to exploit the current margin of manoeuvre,
provided their actions can be justified against the agreed criteria.
The old ERM was merely a means towards a sensible, co-operative monetary
policy. What is needed now is to build a new co-operative policy, one which
recognises that EC member states sometimes have divergent requirements, even
though they share common monetary objectives. The new ERM provides the
basis. The EC should build upon what it offers.

Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, does not exchange a view over
Hong Kong harbour for a squint at the Pool of London until the week after
next, but the fall-out of the chairman's relocation to England has already
begun.
After his nearly 15 year-stint at Midland, and his subsequent elevation to
head group public affairs at HSBC Holdings following the takeover, Alan
Macdonald is off. 'I've seen five chairmen and as many chief executives and
here was yet another one,' he says ruefully, admitting that the timing of
his exit was not quite of his choosing.
'Messages would arrive from Hong Kong; the role became less that of an
adviser, more one of carrying out instructions in the military,' says
Macdonald, who in his time was a not uncontroversial boss himself.
When Sir William touches down, Midland staff had better study his photo,
because unscheduled visits to outlying branches are apparently his sort of
thing, while their boss, Midland chief Brian Pearse, has to get used to
having Purves down the street.
A member of Hong Kong's executive council, the chairman may also prove an
intimidating prospect to British regulators and legislators.
Meanwhile, Macdonald is unlikely to be the last to move on as Purves puts
his feet under a desk which no longer commands that cherished view of
international shipping plying its trade.

Another Anglo-Saxon ventures into the higher reaches of the Swiss banking
community, a domain where the climate, for the non-Swiss, is not noted for
its clemency.
Australian-born Phillip Colebatch, who has just been named chief financial
and administrative officer of CS Holding, parent company of the financial
group built around Credit Suisse, has survived since 1984 at CS First Boston
in London, latterly as chief financial officer.
But will he fare better at head office than did, say, Andrew Large? Now
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, Large stayed for little
more than a year among the Swiss Bank Corporation gnomes in Basle.
Walter Frehner, chief executive of SBC when Large was on the executive
board, later insisted that the bank was open to foreigners, but that they
had to speak German - preferably Swiss German.
CS, being a holding company, may prove easier to penetrate than the banks
themselves. English is spoken at executive board meetings and Colebatch will
have American John Hennessy, chief executive of CSFB, as well as his former
boss in London, German Hans-Jorg Rudloff, for company.
Anyway, despite his exalted title, Colebatch will attend meetings without,
initially, being a board member himself. 'There is a quota for foreigners,
it is not so easy,' explains Rudloff, who was moved to Zurich in March from
his position atop the London operation.
Rudloff judges Colebatch to be progressing well with his German lessons:
'high German; no one learns this little (Swiss ) dialect unless they are
born with it.'
Ach so. And how about the quota? Must one of the foreigners move over before
Colebatch gets his seat?

Last night's 'Dance to the Beat of Labour in Power' permitted a nostalgic
Labour party fringe to hang loose in Brighton to the beat of 1970s disco
hits.
Harking back to the era when the left last called the tunes at Westminster,
the revellers unaccountably omitted to supplement old favourites such as
'When will I see you again' with, suitably remixed from the film Grease,
'You're the one-member-one-vote that I want'.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Observer: Classic route to the investor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No one can blame Goldman Sachs for racking its collective brains in search
of inventive arguments with which to back Daimler-Benz as it rides down Wall
Street next week. But could the US investment bank, co-adviser for the New
York Stock Exchange share listing, be working potential investors a mite too
hard?
'The concept of crisis in classical aesthetics from Aristotle to Hegel
represents the turning point of a fateful process,' the 285-page buy note
opens, presumably easing the reader in gently.
'The crisis has the appearance of an objective fate bursting in from
without. In fact the contradiction expressed at the catastrophic moment of
the drama has long been present in the dramatic action and the personalities
of the heroes . . .' the document elaborates.
Forced for the purposes of the listing to drop the veil of German accounting
conventions, under which Daimler had forecast a tidy profit of DM1bn this
year, Germany's leading company drives off the side into the red to the tune
of some DM2bn when its profit and loss account is translated into the lingo
of the American bean-counters.
Enter stage left the deus ex machina, Goldman's London-based German analyst
Timothy Plaut and his chorus.
All of a sudden, Daimler's cleansing begins, with the 'crisis' illuminated
as 'the sole prerequisite for renewal'.
Steeped in the corporate culture of a country where high-flown rhetoric is
far from unusual, Plaut may have overestimated his audience's erudition this
time around.
Or does he believe US fund managers would be safer reading Aristotle's
Poetics than Daimler's accounts?

<TEXT>
Sir, Taking nothing away from Mr Ted Turner, founder of CNN ('Poised for a
home run', September 20), he has built an impressive news network that has
come to dominate the world stage. Only CNN reaches 200 countries and more
than 16 per cent of the world's 800m TV homes.
However, I think that Mr Turner should be careful in making such statements
as: 'They've (the French) got this bee in their bonnet about French culture.
They've got great culture, I've been to Versailles.'
As Mr Turner should have learned in June when Telemundo, the
Spanish-language television network, decided not to renew its five-year
contract with CNN and instead teamed up with Reuters and the BBC, in order
to be successful globally he must work with an appreciation for diverse
cultural backgrounds and not assume that the world is an American
ball-field.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fallacy of pressures for short-term
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID DAMANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Waller writes that the listing of Daimler on the New York Stock
Exchange is 'likely to influence the way in which the group is managed,
putting the management board under greater pressure to generate short-term
profit and pay higher dividends to performance-oriented US shareholders'
('Daimler plunges to loss of Pounds 380m', September 18/19).
This is a statement frequently made by German industrialists and bankers,
and perhaps believed by many boards of management in the Anglo-Saxon
countries.
But it is contrary to the facts. The Stock Exchanges in London and New York
take account of long-term prospects (for large companies at least) and do
not like short-term profits if they result from actions detrimental to those
long-term prospects.
Reinvestment is preferred to dividends if the reinvestment can enhance a
company's prospects; a drug company perceived as having inadequate research
and development expenditure can certainly be marked down.
Fund managers and analysts frequently talk about the short-term prospects,
in particular for earnings, but this stems essentially from the fact that
the next annual or interim results contain the next important new
information concerning a company's future - long term as well as short term.
Unfortunately anecdotal evidence of such conversations is given greater
weight than the overwhelming body of academic evidence that the markets in
the Anglo-Saxon countries take a long-term view and use detailed accounting
disclosures appropriately. Another way of giving life to fallacies is to
repeat them.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taboos that need to be broken in
Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OSMAN STREATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You say that 'restoring hope to areas such as docklands is essential if
extreme right-wing politics is not to be a recurrent form of protest in
elections'. You note that 'many white, working-class people in the area have
been economically marginalised by the docks' decline'. But you fail to take
note of what is being done to restore hope and create work - modern work -
if not for died-in-the-wool-Jack-Dash-dockers, then their children, and
those of incomers ('A shiver in east London', September 20).
For example, last December a Pounds 1.2m training centre opened in Tower
Hamlets, aimed especially at women and people from ethnic minorities and
offering training in office skills, computing and new technology. One month
later, two new Access Centres were opened in Wapping and on the Isle of
Dogs. Run by Skillnet, the Access Centres are designed to act as the first
link in the chain between unemployment and a job for all young Tower Hamlets
people.
In neighbouring Newham, the Docklands Computer Aided Learning project is
giving more than 10,000 Newham children of all origins the benefit of the
highest concentration of computers anywhere in Europe.
If good is to come out of evil, it will be necessary for both working-class
and middle-class English taboos to be broken. For the former, this means
acknowledging the correlation between the introduction of the Dock Labour
Scheme in 1967 and the start of the closure of London's docks in 1968. It
also means acknowledging that father-to-son working-class employment is no
longer valid in the 1990s.
As for the middle class, perhaps it needs to rid itself once and for all of
post-colonial guilt - surely the driving force behind the housing policy of
Tower Hamlets Council. Osman Streater,

FT  27 SEP 93 / Let's face the music, then change the tune: Peter Middleton,
chief executive of Lloyd's, outlines his strategies for the insurance market
to Richard Lapper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year is 2003 and the losses incurred in the early 1990s by Lloyd's of
London are a distant memory. A more streamlined and profitable insurance
market has emerged, with its centre in the '1958 building' on Lime Street -
Lloyd's former headquarters. The controversial glass and steel structure
designed by Mr Richard Rogers and opened in 1986 has been transformed into
an arts and leisure complex, the equivalent of the Pompidou Centre in Paris.
Upstairs in the 12-storey building tourists drift through an international
art gallery and Americans queue at Lloyd's 'Historic London' theme park,
which has seen its popularity increase recently after rave reviews in the
US.
Downstairs, City workers and visitors mingle in the Lloyd's cafes, shops and
sports centre, all independently owned, all meeting quality standards and
controls set by Lloyd's.
This may seem a far-fetched vision but it is 'not entirely a fantasy',
according to Mr Peter Middleton, who has just completed his first year as
chief executive of the insurance market. After fighting to ensure the
market's commercial survival, Mr Middleton, a former diplomat who as chief
executive of Thomas Cook, the travel services group, helped transform the
fortunes of another famous UK brand, is now looking towards the longer term.
The creative use of two of Lloyd's most valuable assets - its brand name and
spacious headquarters - is likely to figure in future strategy discussions.
'Rather than seeing the building as an albatross, we could turn it into a
revenue-raising venture,' says Mr Middleton, who, as a keen runner,
confesses that he would like to see a leisure centre with a gymnasium in
Lloyd's. He also muses about the absence of an art gallery and the shortage
of shops in the City.
For the moment, these ideas are 'theoretical options', as Mr Middleton
devotes his energies to more pressing problems. His first year has been a
tough one. 'It seemed as if we were climbing up a never-ending hill,' he
says, reflecting on the impact in June of the market's biggest loss of
Pounds 2.9bn.
Coming after losses of Pounds 510m in 1988 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989, this
has been a heavy blow for many of the 19,700 Names whose personal assets
support the market. Legal actions and accusations of mismanagement have
escalated. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating the activities of one
Lloyd's syndicate.
The appointment of a new management team, under Mr David Rowland, the
chairman, and dedicated to root-and-branch reform, has improved the market's
prospects.
'When you look back, if we hadn't done the things we did in the timescale -
I think the Pounds 2.9bn loss this year could have sandbagged Lloyd's. We
would have become marginal,' says Mr Middleton. 'We have built a lot of
bridges to Names . . . some things are now going our way.'
Although he is optimistic that Lloyd's can settle legal actions by thousands
of Names out of court, Mr Middleton is adamant that Lloyd's could survive
adverse court rulings if cases proceeded.
Earlier this year there were fears that Names would reduce their commitments
and that the market's capacity (the capital base allowing it to underwrite
premiums) would shrink. Yet Lloyd's now expects its existing Names to supply
sufficient capital to allow it to underwrite up to Pounds 7.5bn next year,
only Pounds 1.2bn less than in 1993.
'We've been amazed at the robustness of the capital base,' explains the
chief executive. The lure of future profits, as insurance and reinsurance
rates continue their rise of up to eight times over the past four years,
partially explains the turnround.
The market's confidence has been strengthened by firm proposals from
merchant banks - including Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Samuel Montagu - that
they are prepared to raise capital for the market from institutional and
retail investors. Earlier this month a rule book - explaining the terms on
which new corporate members can participate - was published. There are signs
that several investment trusts and companies could be launched before the
end of the year, raising between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn of fresh
capital.
Mr Middleton says corporate capital will bring long-term security of funding
to the market. 'We can't suppose traditional forms of capital will remain
open to us for ever.'
Another positive sign, he says, is that corporate financiers appear
satisfied that Lloyd's plans to 'ring fence' new investors against claims
for billions of pounds in US pollution and asbestosis liabilities will work.
Reserves to meet liabilities arising on all insurance policies sold by
Lloyd's before 1986 are to be transferred into a new reinsurance company,
which should be up and running by 1996.
Several hurdles must still be negotiated. Lloyd's must win Names' approval
for its capital plans at a potentially stormy EGM next month, for example.
But Mr Middleton should soon have more time to focus on implementing Lloyd's
first business plan, unveiled in April.
Mr Middleton is bluntly critical of many of the market's habits. The main
areas under scrutiny are costs, including wages, professionalism and
management:
Costs. Wage levels are one issue. Nearly half the market's 200 or so
underwriters earn more than Pounds 100,000 a year; brokers' and agents'
salaries are equally high. 'I have no problem about this, when an
underwriter is consistently making a lot of money,' says Mr Middleton. 'But
I didn't see (the market) cutting back when times were difficult.'
The level of entertainment typically enjoyed by the market is also a
'significant cost'. 'They have a taste for jamborees on a frequency and a
scale that other sectors have abandoned,' he says.
Tackling such abuses will involve encouraging greater transparency and
accountability. Agencies and underwriters 'have to break down their
expenditure. That is when the potential investor will ask what and at what
cost,' says Mr Middleton.
The restructuring of the market over the past three years should also help
improve efficiency and save money. Many syndicates (groups of Names that
underwrite business) have been closed because of losses, or merged. Next
year, Mr Middleton expects there to be no more than 150 syndicates, compared
with more than 400 in 1990. As a result, the average syndicate is bigger
than in the late 1980s, underwriting more premiums for each unit of cost,
and better managed.
'To an uncanny degree the survivors are the people who you would want to
survive,' he says. Professionalism. The fall in the number of businesses
will make it easier for Lloyd's to regulate the market and enforce
standards. In the past, the Corporation of Lloyd's, which administers the
market, has stood aside, operating in a manner similar to the civil service.
In the 1990s Mr Middleton expects the relationship between the corporation
and the market to become closer.
Increasingly, the corporation will not only police the market as a
regulator, by ensuring that syndicates do not insure too many risks compared
with the size of their capital, for example, but guide and direct the type
and quality of business being underwritten.
Mr Middleton says the independent agencies (companies that manage
syndicates) will increasingly resemble 'franchises' licensed to operate with
the Lloyd's brand. In the past, agencies have jealously guarded their
independence from central control.
When Lloyd's has reduced its cost structure and put its quality control in
place, managers will turn their attention to the next three-year business
plan - which will take the market from 1996-98. 'We will concentrate on the
things we are good at,' says Mr Middleton. At present Lloyd's syndicates
underwrite a wide range of insurance, from high-risk reinsurance, aircraft
and oil rigs at one end of the spectrum to lower-risk motor and home
business, for example, at the other. Mr Middleton says that, in future,
Lloyd's will exercise more pressure on the market - through adjusting fee or
levy structures, for example - to leave some of these areas if returns are
inadequate.
Lloyd's faces an unprecedented degree of centralisation in coming years.
Changes that would have been inconceivable five years ago now provide a base
for an even more radical transformation. The market might jettison parts of
its business, it might acquire new businesses in continental Euorpe, or
invite companies from outside the market to participate and operate under
its brand name.
'If we came to the conclusion in five years that what Europe needs is a
single profit centre to compete internationally, I'd want Lloyd's to be part
of that discussion with potential partners,' says Mr Middleton. 'I am seeing
Lloyd's more and more as a company.'
Lloyd's as a diversified business, with activities ranging from insurance to
retailing, may be a vision Mr Middleton confines to 'his lighter moments'
today. But the reality could be nearer than many imagine.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Personal View: Private sector key to Africa's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEWIS T PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times's recent supplement on sub-Saharan Africa ('Africa; A
continent at stake', September 1) performed a service for everyone concerned
with development. At a time when the world's attention is diverted to the
dramatic changes taking place in other areas, it is vital that the magnitude
of the development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa is not forgotten.
Half the region's 600m people live in absolute poverty. It is the only
region where the number of poor people would - if current trends are not
reversed - increase by the year 2000, where population is doubling every 20
years, and external debt exceeds gross domestic product. Indeed, the future
of the continent is 'at stake'.
However, Africa is also changing. We are all familiar with the evolving
political transformation in South Africa. Not so well known is the
fundamental change in economic policies which has been taking place across
much of sub-Saharan Africa.
This has been a 'quiet revolution', with more than 30 countries undertaking
adjustment programmes aimed at increasing productivity and growth. The
intensity and success of their reforms have varied, and more time will be
required before definitive results emerge. However, there are signs of
progress.
Benin, Burundi, the Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda are among a
group of countries - supported under a special programme of assistance
co-ordinated by the World Bank - that has achieved growth rates double the
region's average, tripled output in the critical agricultural sector, and
reversed the decline in exports.
There remains a long way to go. But these results indicate that in Africa -
as in East Asia or Latin America - adjustment to economic realities produces
economic results. Now is not the time for Africa to slow down its reform
efforts. On the contrary, they must be accelerated.
Many countries have taken the first macroeconomic steps. Africa now needs to
underpin them with a 'second generation' of reforms - to encourage the
private sector, and to build its human and institutional capacities.
About 350m new jobs will be needed in sub-Saharan Africa within a
generation. Only the private sector - free to allocate resources and respond
to market signals - can create employment and incomes on this scale. And
only the private sector can provide Africa with the access it needs to
investment, know-how and technology. The message is clear: the movement
toward a 'market-friendly' approach must be broadened and deepened. It is
Africa's only hope of competing in the global economy of the 21st century.
Educated and healthy people - and competent institutions - are also
essential. In this regard providers of aid to Africa have a major
responsibility. The international community needs to re-examine the quality
of its assistance effort - and its overall development effectiveness. Donors
cannot be satisfied that external technical assistance to sub-Saharan Africa
has increased over the last decade and now stands at about Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.5bn) a year. Nor can they be satisfied that an estimated 100,000
expatriate 'advisers' are at work in Africa today, a larger number than at
independence.
At the same time - and as the FT pointed out - Africa knows that the 'rules
of the aid game' have changed in the post-cold war era. The competition for
resources has never been greater. Aid budgets are being scrutinised and, in
some cases, cut. Countries that cannot show they are using aid effectively -
and that means good governance as well as good economic policy - will lose
it.
The World Bank is one of Africa's strongest supporters in its development
efforts. Evidence of this is the wide range of initiatives we have
undertaken as well as the volume of our lending. But we don't have all the
resources required. And we don't have all the answers. Our partners in the
donor community have a crucial role to play. Non-government organisations
are vital at the grass roots. And the private sector holds the key to
providing the bulk of future investment.
However, the principal responsibility for Africa's development rests with
Africa and its leaders. They must adopt the right policies, inspire
confidence in investors, and motivate their peoples.
Many African nations have started to change in the right direction. The
international community must support them.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Labour law must be simplified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You were right to argue in your editorial, 'UK labour laws' (September
13), that employment law in the UK needs rationalisation, and that
collective labour law is not the main problem. The most pressing need for
reform is in relation to individual rights. Here the law is too difficult to
understand and uneconomic to enforce. The law on everyday matters such as
maternity leave is fully understood only by lawyers specialising in the
field. Employees have to wait many months, sometimes years, for disputes to
be resolved. Hearings last for days because industrial tribunals are bogged
down in legalism and legal fees often far exceed the amount of compensation
awarded.
The problem stems from the policy of keeping statutory employment rights
separate from contractual rights. The motive was to avoid legalism. It was
hoped that by giving industrial tribunals jurisdiction over separate
statutory rights covering matters such as unfair dismissal, redundancy pay,
maternity and discrimination they would be able to dispense speedy, cheap
and efficient justice. It hasn't worked. There is now a complex body of case
law in each of these areas and delay and expense are accepted as a matter of
course.
The answer is not to complicate the law even further by adding
quasi-constitutional rights or additional codes of practice to the present
mix of European Community rights, statutory rights and contractual rights.
The answer must be the opposite; to simplify and rationalise employment law
by returning it to its roots in contract. If legislation simply required
employers to provide minimal rights in the contract of employment, problems
about overlap between contractual and statutory rights would disappear and
whole areas of legalism - for instance much of the case law and unfair
dismissal, redundancy and maternity - would fall away.
Consider how this would work in relation to compensation for unfair
dismissal. The contract would specify the circumstances in which an
individual could be dismissed without compensation. This is, in effect, what
happens at the moment in senior executive contracts. A contract would
specify the amount of compensation to be paid in other cases, or a formula
for calculating it, and, adopting one of your ideas, the employee would be
protected against unreasonable dismissal by a code of practice agreed in the
contract. In a dispute, the issue would simply be whether or not the
employer had broken the contract of employment.
If jurisdiction were given to industrial tribunals to determine such
disputes they might be able to provide the cheap, speedy, effective justice
originally intended.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Say yes to freedom - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suppose it is inevitable that a critic writing about architecture towards
the end of the 20th century is going to be charged with scepticism,
arrogance or even hostility towards the architectural establishment. Anyone
who questions objectively the value of the achievements of the profession in
the last 50 years will be seen, not as broad minded and catholic, but as
narrow minded and prejudiced.
These thoughts are encouraged, not by resentful letters from architects and
art bureaucrats, but by the broader debate which has been prompted by the
government's decision to 'deregulate' the title of architect and allow fresh
air to blow into the closed shop. In the Queen's Speech opening the next
session of parliament a deregulation bill will propose, in the context of a
wish to scrap as much government red tape as possible, the end of the
statutory protection of the title, 'architect'.
At present only someone registered with the nominally independent Architects
Registration Council of the United Kingdom (Arcuk) can legally call himself
an architect. This body was set up in 1931 to regulate the membership,
conduct and education of the profession. It was necessary because
governments have always questioned the monopolistic powers of the Royal
Institute of British Architects (Riba)  - a body that sets professional
standards and (until recently) established fixed scales of fees. Inevitably
what has happened over the years is that Arcuk has really been run by the
weight of Riba members on its councils, and the sense of an unfair monopoly
remains.
When he was interviewed recently in this newspaper the current president of
the Riba, Frank Duffy - a man of great personal conviction and integrity -
squealed a great deal about the dangers of deregulation. But what is odd is
that the profession does not welcome the freedom it is being offered.
Deregulation will allow the Riba to ensure that its own standards are worth
having because of their merits, not because they are officially protected.
Good architects today are not marginalised by the building process. In a
freer climate it does not follow that only the cheapest and the worst will
thrive.
The nub of this regulation or deregulation problem is that the Riba feels
wrong footed by the government. The profession should have grasped the
nettle a long time ago and taken the lead in setting the highest possible
architectural and environmental standards. Instead, it appears that during
the 1960s a silent majority of salaried architects allowed a managerial
profession to develop which is largely without imagination or awareness of
the client's needs. The Riba's identity crisis has increased recently: is it
a learned society or a trade union?
Deregulation offers freedom - something people often find difficult.
Architectural educational standards will continue to be supervised by the
Riba, so the Institute should take the lead and promote the ideas of
imaginative architecture and sound building. It should welcome a more
competitive climate. If the mediocre architects - and there are lots - go to
the wall, then so be it: they will be no loss.
The chance to open windows to all who build has arrived. How tragic and how
typical of architects to fight a rearguard action instead of offering an
inspiring leadership emphasising quality.
*****
The growing interest of the public in the visual arts and architecture gets
a boost this week with the launch of a new art magazine, Tate - The Art
Magazine, which is published in close association with the Tate Gallery in
London. In the first issue the artist Bridget Riley writes inspiringly about
the need for a new gallery of modern art in London.
This debate has been masterminded to date by the director of the Tate
Gallery, Nicholas Serota, but now it has to become a much more public issue.
In the same way that deregulation of the architectural profession should
make architecture itself much closer to the client and the community the
creation of a major national centre for contemporary art should involve the
public in art in a new way.
Will the Tate rescue the great Giles Gilbert Scott power station on London's
Bankside as its new home and link it to the City with a new bridge? The Tate
debate has just begun but it could bring art and architecture into public
prominence in a positive way.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: String quartet with a French connection - Chamber
music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In addition to being this country's most intensely communicative and
impassioned string quartet, the Lindsay Quartet have proved themselves
capital festival-creators. This gift was first revealed in Sheffield, where
for 10 years they have been holding a spring chamber-music festival; more
recently it has been further developed at the London Wigmore Hall, where
their week-long series-packages have provided the annual autumnal
season-launching.  (The Lindsay's 1987 Haydn festival still shines
particularly bright in the memory of all who took their share of it.)
The theme of this year's programme (September 25 - October 2, with lunch
hour as well as evening events) is one of their most ambitious yet. It
weaves a web of Anglo-French connections and contrasts, placing side by side
chamber-music masterpieces from both sides of the Channel and new works
similarly commissioned, and sharing performance duties with a roster of
French and English chamber-musician 'friends'. This celebration of the
entente cordiale was intended to coincide with the opening of the Channel
Tunnel - but as the Lindsay first violin, Peter Cropper, rather plaintively
remarks in a programme-book introduction, 'We cannot help it if we are on
time]'
Saturday's opening concert outlined the festival's basic programme pattern.
Franck's mighty Piano Quintet (with Jean-Francois as imaginative,
invigorating pianist) supplied the second-half masterwork. Britten's Third
Quartet and Dutilleux's Ainsi la nuit, both written in the same year (1976),
provided first-half experiences full in themselves and perhaps just a little
fuller for being closely juxtaposed. Britten's great tribute to his admired
compositional confrere Shostakovich - a farewell to life and to composition
which is at the same time a gloriously unfettered glance into the future -
seemed newly enlarged in stature when placed alongside Dutilleux's exquisite
but eventually rather enervated re-discovery of Bartokian and Webernian
nerve ends.
To all these works the Lindsay brought the musicianly energy and ebullience,
the passion for facing challenges and surmounting hurdles, that is theirs
alone. Though Mr Cropper's intonation showed itself more regularly reliable
than is sometimes the case, the quality of the ensemble-playing was never
exactly fine-grained - but it was unfailingly exhilarating. The concert
began with two brand-new musical squibs, both short and rather damp: a 'God
Save the Queen' meditation by a Frenchman (Jean-Francois Zygel) and a
Marseillaise one by an Englishman (Christopher Brown). Since the festival
promises substantial amounts of much more enticing-looking new music, I
shall return to it later this week.

Given the obsession with serial killers and ghastly crimes, it was obvious
that TV drama would soon turn to forensic psychology, the glamour profession
of the 1990s. The forensic psychologist is a modern witchdoctor. In a
paranoid society, he offers reassurance that we have mind-readers who can
track down the killers in our midst. Cracker (9.00 ITV), which starts
tonight, is a grim and violent detective series set in Scotland. Robbie
Coltrane stars as a police shrink with uncanny 'profiling' skills and a
conventionally unhappy domestic life.
At this time of year, ashamed by loss of face on holiday, many of us sign up
for language courses and look for subtitled imports on TV. If French has
been your Waterloo, you could start with Prostitute (9.00 C4). But be
warned. In tonight's programme on the bleak lives of two transvestite
prostitutes, the business of gender becomes sorely confused.
If you are looking for laughs, try the new comedy Get Back (8.30 BBC), about
the effect of recession on working-class folk in a particularly tatty area
of north London.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Mainstream Madonna - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Madonna has turned pro. Six years ago in London she revelled in her
naughtiness, as she stripped the imagination with her virgin/whore routine,
tossing her knickers at the audience with the elan of a convert to excess.
Three years later she was the cruel mistress, despising her fans for the
prurience she had exploited. Now, Madonna is the detached entertainer,
putting on a show. The shadow of Las Vegas fell across the Wembley stage.
With The Girlie Show, which opened a global tour on Saturday, Madonna boldly
adds herself to the rota of show biz greats. This is mainstream spectacle,
with a few shocks but none of the schlock which was Madonna's ribald gesture
to the world.'
It opens reassuringly with a topless dancer pirouetting down a long silver
pole. It continues predictably with Madonna, clad in a handful of black
sequins, ascending from the depths to a revolving circle where she whips
herself into a quick orgasm with 'Erotica'. Wanting playmates she collects a
couple of male dancers from the catwalk, strips them, and drags them down to
hell, vividly conveyed in a burst of flames.
You stifle a yawn, realise your blood pressure has fallen if anything, and
wait for the dead donkey. But Madonna is, as ever, the tease. That's the
last of decadence, of the bad old days. From now on its an all-singing,
all-dancing sequence of routines, bursting with energy, if sometimes
flagging in imagination.
Circus music and a clown provide the less than stunning motif as Madonna
runs through the songs from her turkey of a latest album 'Erotica', plus a
few sure-fire standards. Dressed now by Dolce &amp; Gabbana she has foresworn
fashion excessories in favour of striped T-shirts and torn jeans. This is
Madonna, the worker. When she does harangue the audience it is not to savage
their bodies but to get some appreciation. 'We are working our butts off up
here.'
At 34 time is catching up with Madonna and she accepts the fact by going
historical. She conjures up Marlene Dietrich, in top hat and tails, and
sings a Teutonic version of 'Like a Wirgin'. She shows her responsibility by
performing solo the ritualistic Aids ballad 'In this life'. She has stopped
inhabiting Planet Madonna and joined the entertainment Establishment.
Of course the need to provoke still surfaces. Seconds after coming over
serious about Aids she has her male dancers humping each other furiously
while she rubs herself, purringly, against the thighs of one of her girls.
And when she falls on to her knees to thank God for holding off the rain she
can't help adding 'I don't get on my knees very often: ask my boy friends'.
But the essence of this enjoyable, and well received, show is of Madonna
dressed like a Russian admiral, commanding her troupers through 'Holiday';
or descending on a silver globe to lead the team into 'Express Yourself',
which climaxes with a cosy love-in, a rip off from Hair; or the finale, at
which the 10 dancers and invisible but excellent band are introduced in a
vigorously choreographed vote of thanks. This is Madonna wearing the mask of
professionalism. It may be less exhilarating than the old devil-raiser but
it guarantees a much longer career.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Two houses clash their swords - Opera in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While musical life in London is taken up with the battle of the orchestras,
Parisians are in the fortunate position of being able to watch the rivalry
between two international opera-houses. An extra frisson is added when one
knows that political rivalry lurks in the background.
The Bastille (or, to give it its full name, the Opera de Paris Bastille) is
the vast new opera-house of the people, a state organisation, the treasured
project of Mitterrand and the left. Even at the opening night of the season,
jeans are de rigeur. The Theatre du Chatelet has a smarter audience than the
old Palais Garnier and is, if not snobbish, at least elegant. It belongs to
the city, the homeground of Chirac and the right.
Surely it cannot be a coincidence that they chose to open their 1993-94
seasons on consecutive nights, both mounting new productions, both turning
to the most ambitious large-scale German operas? The clash of swords can
almost be heard from behind the drop-curtain.
The Bastille came first. Its new production of Wagner's Der fliegende
Hollander was entrusted to the film producer Werner Herzog, who has already
essayed Wagner (without great success) at Bayreuth. He updated the opera to
the early years of the industrial revolution. Senta and her workmates have
dispensed with their spinning-wheels and operate a large textile machine.
Daland's men are first seen trying to haul their capsized steamship out of
the water - memories of Herzog's film, Fitzcarraldo.
The programme reminded us that Wagner was inspired to take up the myth of
the flying Dutchman after a perilous journey by sea to England, during which
storms forced the boat to take refuge off the coast of Norway. Herzog has
seized upon this image and set the opera in a frozen wasteland. An iceberg
looms over the scene; when the time comes for the arrival of the Dutchman's
ship, it rises out of the sea to a vast height and disgorges the wandering
mariner.
That is the limit to the production's entertainment value. Nothing that
follows suggests that Herzog has any point to make out of his choice of time
or place. Maurizio Balo's settings are impressive (so they should be on the
most lavishly equipped opera-stage in the world) but the characters could be
anybody, at any time, anywhere.
Somewhere along the line the Bastille had lost its scheduled baritone. Simon
Estes, a much-travelled Dutchman, took over, singing strongly, but not
making much either of the words or the personality. During the long duet
with Senta he hit an awkward patch where he seemed fated to arrive in tune
only one line in every seven. Sabine Hass's Senta was a cuddly figure, not
much given to obsessions or neuroses, who revealed most about herself when
she was punching out big, blazing top notes.
Nothing that passed between them was of any moment, although I hesitate to
blame the singers for that, as the same vacuum enveloped Aage Haugland's
booming Daland and Peter Straka's Erik. Myung-Whun Chung and the Bastille
orchestra received a roar of applause, which would be hard to justify. It
seemed to me that the performance needed a stiff dose of discipline to stop
it losing impetus and getting becalmed for long stretches at a time.
The next night at the Theatre du Chatelet - another coincidence. The
Chatelet's new production of Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier was also set in the
period of the opera's composition. Adolf Dresen, the producer, had done away
with Rococo finery and set the piece in the years just before the First
World War.
If penny-pinching was the objective, he could hardly have done the company a
better favour. No need for all that gilt decor, brocaded upholstery and
sumptuous costumes. The Marschallin's bedroom consisted of merely a bed and
a grandfather clock (she must have a clock of some kind, if she is to stop
the time in the middle of the night). The Baron's seduction supper was held
outdoors in the backyard of the local Heuriege, not a plausible locale.
Visually it was a big disappointment, but Dresen scored by making his
characters really seem to live in that period.
It is unlikely that Felicity Lott will ever look more at home as the
Marschallin than she did here. With her willowy stance, sinuous arms,
elegantly casual walk, she is the picture of a society lady in the
20th-century understanding of the term. Morals had changed somewhat by 1910
and one imagines that she would easily forget this affair with a shrug of
her shoulders (oh, those shoulders] Are there any in opera today which work
harder?) The voice is only just weighty enough, even in this theatre, but
she floated the opening of the trio to graceful perfection.
Every comment, every look that passed between her and Randi Stene's
tousle-haired Octavian, as their relationship broke down, was heartrending.
No Octavian that I have seen has looked younger, more vulnerable than Stene,
an impressively confident young mezzo, and the sense of pain was akin to
needles piercing innocent young flesh. Cyndia Sieden was a delightfully
open, uninhibited Sophie. Kurt Rydl convincingly turned Baron Ochs into a
sharp-witted dealer in dapper suit and panama hat, quick to pocket the
croissant left on the Marschallin's breakfast table.
After his lacklustre showing at the Aix-en-Provence festival in the summer
Armin Jordan was a conductor transformed, keeping Strauss's music thrusting
forwards without slackening or sentimentality. He was fortunate to have the
Philharmonia Orchestra from London (sponsored by Rover France) on good form
in the pit. Why ever should this orchestra be facing the threat of closure
when it is proving such a high-profile ambassador for British music abroad?
The French must think us mad. Ironic to find the battles of British musical
politics being fought in Paris as well.

FT  27 SEP 93 / People: Cipau seeks a welcome in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, has reinforced its determination to
expand in Japan, the world's second largest market, by appointing a new
president there. For the first time, the post also carries a main board
position.
Gabriel Cipau, 52, is to become president of Nippon Wellcome KK, the British
group's 55 per cent-owned joint-venture with Sumitomo of Japan.
The company has only a limited portfolio in Japan - Zovirax, Zyloric, and
Retrovir - but according to John Robb, group chief executive, 'we've done
pretty well.' Sales in Japan increased by 18 per cent last year to Pounds
128m.
'But strategically we have to make progress in Japan if we are to grow. We
have worldwide market share of 1.4 per cent and US market share of 2 per
cent. However, in Japan it is only about 0.6 per cent. Improving that is a
high priority for us,' he says, nor does he exclude the possibility of
making an acquisition there.
Robb says the importance of Japan is reflected in the decision to make the
position a board appointment. The directors of the US, Europe and the
international operations are already on the board.
The aim is to look at licensing opportunities in Japan, particularly
licensing products to Japanese companies. This should help drugs pass
through the regulatory process more quickly. Wellcome's portfolio includes
valaciclovir, a new anti-herpes compound, and Lamactil, an anti-epileptic
drug which may also be used to treat stroke victims.
Nippon Wellcome will soon face added competition in Japan against its
best-selling product there, the anti-herpes treatment Zovirax. Nippon Shoji
Kaisha has developed a competitor compound called sorivudine which is
expected to be licensed soon to treat shingles.

FT  27 SEP 93 / People: TUC picks Feikart for Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress has made an imaginative choice in the first head
of its Brussels office. David Feikart, 47, is not well known outside the
mining industry in Britain, but is an experienced lobbyist in Europe - and
speaks good French.
Feikart has spent most of the past 10 years working in the research
department, and latterly as head of research, at the National Union of
Mineworkers.
After a first degree in his native New Zealand, he came to Britain to study
Ergonomics at Birmingham University. Later at Bradford University he did
some work on mechanisation in the coal industry and predicted the job losses
of the following decade - figures that were ridiculed at the time.
In 1983 he moved to the NUM in Sheffield, just before the year-long miners'
strike. Although committed to the miners' cause, he eventually found the
paranoid atmosphere at NUM hq unbearable and left, earlier this year, to
become an energy consultant.
The Brussels office is due to open on December 1 by which time he and his
family will have decided whether to move house or whether he will be a
long-distance commuter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jermyn Brooks (above) has been elected chairman of Price Waterhouse in
Europe in succession to Sir Geoffrey Bowman, who announced his retirement
earlier this year.
Brooks, 54, was partner in charge of PW in Germany, and is currently joint
managing director of PW in Europe. He has been a member of the PW European
management board since 1989.
As chairman, he will have responsibility for helping shape the future
direction of the firm, though he said yesterday he was still determining his
three or four main priorities.
The PW European organisation was formed through the combination of all the
firm's European operations, including those in the UK, which contribute
about half total fees.
There is some degree of cost- and profit-sharing within the firm's 138
different offices in 28 countries across the continent; revenues were Pounds
775m in the year to June 30.
Brooks joined PW in 1962 and transferred to Frankfurt in 1967 where he
became a partner in 1973. He was in charge of the Iran practice during
1977-79, set up the firm's operations in Turkey in 1981-85, and then led the
audit and management consultancy operations in Germany. He has both English
and German accountancy qualifications.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Management: Checking out the front line - Sir Alistair
Grant, chairman of Argyll, suggests ways of staying close to staff and
customers / Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir ALISTAIR GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Napoleon is popularly credited with responsibility for introducing the
metric system, but the truth is that he tried to suppress it. He wrote of
its proposed introduction: 'Nothing is more contrary to the organisation of
the mind, of memory and of the imagination.' Presumably he thought he was in
touch with the wishes of the common people; in fact, he was surrounded by
advisers, lobbyists and eminent men and women cut off from direct contact
with everyday life.
We all run the risk of becoming petty Napoleons, and none of us has
Napoleon's compensating genius. How can we continue to take the pulse of our
business when we become directors or general managers excluded from direct
contact with front-line staff or with our customers? We can side-step the
problem in two ways: we can rely on market research or, more pompously, we
can suggest that we are responsible for the direction of the business -
strategy, policy, the provision of key resources - rather than its detailed
management.
During the past five years I have introduced a number of practices into
Argyll in an attempt to ensure that directors stay close to the market, and
also to encourage more people throughout the company to think about the
whole business, not just their particular product or store or department.
Our first initiative was the Young Managers' Forum. We selected 24 men and
women from every part of the company - operations, trading, marketing,
finance, distribution, personnel - and split them, more or less randomly,
into four sub-groups. Each group selected a mentor from the Safeway board
and chose a project which they would tackle together over a 12-month period.
One group elected to deal with 'stress and tension among customers and staff
at the supermarket checkout'. By the time they were through they had
re-designed the checkout, eliminated the wires, metal pipes and flashing
lights, introducing a pleasant green colour, creating more space and
introducing a back-to-back module which enabled each checkout operator to
see the face of his or her opposite number at the next checkout instead of
having to stare at the back of a head.
Other groups have looked at projects such as fruit merchandising to avoid
spoilage, at ways of getting to know more about specific customers in each
store, at opportunities for selling to offices and work places - all with
positive results.
Last year I asked each director three questions. Had he ever managed a
store? When did he last manage a store? What was the size of the largest
store he had managed? The results were fairly predictable. Only around a
quarter of us had store management experience, none of us had managed a
store within the past 20 years, the biggest store any of us had managed was
less than half the size of our current average new store.
I invited each director to adopt a store for a year. The brief was to get to
know the store, its customers and its competitors; to assist the store
manager to improve his operations; to become the colleague of management and
staff; and to contribute to Safeway's competence in store operations by
improving our understanding of how 'head office' decisions affect life at
store level.
My own adopted store is in a Midland town and competes with two discount
operators. Sometimes I spend half a day there acting not as a supernumerary
district manager but as a colleague of the store manager. I can take an
interest in any aspect of the store, I can spend a morning talking to
customers, I can assess our specific local strengths and weaknesses against
the competition.
What am I learning? There is too much to recount, but it includes noting
that it takes us too long to make a cup of cappuccino in our cafe, that we
need to improve our in-store pizza operations, that customer problems in a
dry cleaning department can be tough problems for staff to deal with and a
host of other observations that are helpful to me and to the whole business.
The man who said 'Retail is Detail' was only partly right but he was
(partly) very right.
Next Monday: Christopher Haskins of Northern Foods on how to handle the
press.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Management: Long march to market - State enterprises still
dominate China's economy. A recent study may help foreign investors in their
dealings with them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's remarkable economic growth is driven by non-state industries, yet
state-owned enterprises still account for half of industrial output and 70
per cent of urban workforces. Any company with significant business in China
will have to deal with them, and may even consider them as candidates for a
joint venture.
Research by British and Chinese universities, however, suggests that the
progress of state-owned enterprises towards the adoption of market-oriented
management practices is painfully slow. The findings will be important for
foreign companies whose managers may be trying to find out what makes
Chinese companies tick, or to ascertain whether their own objectives and
those of a local partner are compatible.
The research project, led by Lancaster University Management School,
compared practices at Chinese enterprises with those of British
private-sector companies in similar fields. It particularly examined how
companies made decisions on strategic investments, and management of human
resources.
The researchers found that in Britain the process of winning the support of
colleagues, managers and eventually the board for a new project was similar
to that in China and took just as much time. The efforts of Chinese
managers, however, were mostly directed outside the company. The
relationships they needed to build were with supervisory ministries and
other authorities, with the aim of securing the many approvals needed for a
project to go ahead.
A second conclusion was that Chinese companies inevitably took a far broader
range of considerations into account, including conformity with central
plans, social responsibilities and technological progress. This suggests
that not much has changed yet in the management of state-owned enterprises -
many of which are chronically loss-making - in spite of the 'contract
responsibility' system under which enterprises sign three- to four-year
profit contracts with their supervisory authority.
Caution is necessary. The investment projects analysed were all approved
more than two years ago. Managers interviewed by the researchers indicated
that things were beginning to change. One sign of the new order came from
the director of Nanjing Chemical, who said he had turned down promotion to
positions in ministries because he wanted to be chairman if shareholder
ownership was introduced.
Still, it will take years for the market-place to break down the uniformity
which the research team found in the approaches of the Chinese companies.
Standardised behaviour - which does at least help the foreigner to know what
to expect - derives from the structure of ministries which draw senior staff
from the enterprises, and from a system designed to manage the entire
country from the top down.
The communist party's role in the management of companies helps to
perpetuate a common approach. The party secretary within an enterprise forms
a balance of power with its director - though there are signs that the
former's role is tending to be limited to monitoring personnel decisions,
and that professional managers are on the rise.
At Beijing Yanshan Petrochemicals the researchers found the party secretary
to be more important than the director, whose appointment he had
recommended. But in Nanjing Chemical the director had worked his way up over
30 years, had strong links with the supervising ministry and controlled all
business decisions including personnel, while the party secretary's role was
limited.
Although there has been some devolution of authority, the researchers found
that all important investment decisions had to be approved by the state or
national government. Once the nod came from the minister concerned,
approvals would follow in rapid sequence from all other relevant
authorities. One company established an office in Beijing for six months to
lobby for its new chemical plant. Its executives repeatedly telephoned key
officials to ensure they had all the information.
Proposals were still driven less by the sensing of a market opportunity than
by a need identified in central planning - for example, shortage of a
specific petrochemical. Managers said projects were becoming more
market-directed and that proposals needed to contain more detailed market
analysis, particularly as the state had ceased to provide grants and
financing must be negotiated with banks. However, the researchers commented
that 'managers' understanding of the market and, in fact, the market itself,
was still dominated and distorted by the continued strong planning bias of
the system'.
Procedures for individual performance evaluation and promotion, though
sophisticated, are also homogeneous. Under an annual appraisal system,
specialist units within companies interview some 15 to 20 of a manager's
peers and a larger number of subordinates about his or her performance.
Criteria for promotion are, in order: good moral and political practice,
competence and motivation in present job, quality of relationships with
others in the company, and performance record. Senior managers are chosen
from production posts and will have deep knowledge of operations. Dismissals
are rare.
However, changes are beginning to be forced upon companies: graduates are no
longer automatically assigned to their first jobs by ministries, and the
growth of non-state industry means that a large part of the labour market is
outside the planners' control. In the fast-growing province of Guangdong,
directors operate with more autonomy, and have to offer higher salaries and
fringe benefits to attract staff.
It is sometimes suggested that state industries will simply wither in the
face of the dynamic growth of industry not directly owned by the state.
However, their economic role is so central and their losses such a drain on
the national budget that it seems essential for the government to take
direct action if economic reform is to be sustainable.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Looking for signs of a Japanese upturn -
Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW light may be shed during the week on the degree to which the Japanese
economy is getting back into gear following the long spell of sluggishness.
Those looking for the country to help propel the world economy into a phase
of sustained expansion by the mid 1990s will be hoping for a reasonably
positive number tomorrow when the Japanese government releases latest
estimates of the year on year change in retail sales in August.
However on the back of estimates by international economists, the retail
data will be less than encouraging, showing a 3.8 per cent year on year drop
after one of 5 per cent in July. Other data from Japan will provide the
latest details of consumer price inflation and industrial production.
In the US, revised second quarter gross domestic product data on Wednesday,
August personal income and consumption figures on Thursday and leading
indicators on Friday will be monitored.
The financial markets will also be looking out for news from the
International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Washington. The gatherings may
provide some indications of the latest progress or lack of it in talks on
freeing global trade and also on how Europe should try to re-create some
degree of exchange rate stability after the fiasco of the virtual breakdown
of the exchange rate mechanism.
In the UK, there will be no significant economic data. Attention will focus
on Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 11-year gilts required to help
finance the 1993-94 Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. The price of the
stock sold in the auction will indicate to what degree overseas institutions
continue their recent fairly strong support for gilt purchases.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is showing signs of wanting to listen to
the business world for advice on economic strategy. So the publication this
week of reports by the Institute of Directors and Confederation of British
Industry on what they want to see in the chancellor's budget strategy will
attract more than the unusual amount of attention.
Finally, today sees the publication of the latest report on what to expect
in the German economy from the respected economics group IFO.
The main events of the week are as follows. Median market forecasts from the
financial information company MMS International are in brackets.
Today: US, International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington
until Thursday; US August home sales.
Germany, business climate report by IFO economics institute.
Tomorrow: France, five-year employment plan due to be discussed in
parliament, Treasury issues 10-year Ecu bond.
Japan, August retail sales (3.8 per cent down on year), July indices of
economic growth.
Finland, July unemployment figures.
US, September index of consumer confidence.
Canada, August industrial production (0.2 per cent up on month), raw
materials price index (up 0.1 per cent on month).
UK, Institute of Directors unveils Budget advice to Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor.
Wednesday: Australia, current account figures for August, August building
data.
US, details of gross domestic product for second quarter and after-tax
corporate profits, export and import price indices for August, September
agricultural prices.
UK, Confederation of British Industry unveils Budget advice to Mr Clarke.
Bank of England auctions Pounds 3.25bn of 6.75 per cent gilts maturing in
2004.

starts. August industrial production (down 1.5 per cent on year.
France, unemployment rate in August (11.8 per cent).
US, initial unemployment claims for week ending September 25, August home
sales and personal income, monetary data for week ending September 20.
Canada, rise in gross domestic product in July (0.2 per cent on month) and
July earnings from employment (up 1.5 per cent on year).
Friday: Germany, Hans Tietmeyer takes over as Bundesbank president.
Japan, September consumer prices index (1.8 per cent up on year, excluding
Tokyo prices, and up 0.9 per cent on year excluding food and other
perishables), August consumer prices index (up 2.1 per cent on year for
whole country, up 1.2 per cent on year excluding food and other
perishables), August unemployment rate.
US, leading indicators for August showing state of economic health, August
factory orders and factory inventories, September figure for the National
Institute of Purchasing Managers index.
During the week: Germany, August import prices and manufacturing output,
industry production.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the retail group, which includes chains such as Olympus, Wallis, Miss
Selfridge and Warehouse, as well as the Selfridges department store, is
expected tomorrow to announce a return to interim profits of about Pounds
30m, after exceptional costs relating to the closure of ter Meulen Post, the
Dutch mail order business. That compares with losses of Pounds 8.8m,
although the figure included an exceptional charge of Pounds 32.5m for the
reorganisation costs of British Shoe Corporation and a Pounds 5.3m loss on
discontinued businesses. Analysts are looking for a strong recovery from
British Shoe, but the performance of the rest of the group is expected to be
patchy.
Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of illustrated reference books floated
last October, is expected to report annual profits of about Pounds 9.5m
tomorrow. Analysts downgraded to that level in March when the group warned
that trading conditions for children's books had become more competitive in
the US. The City will want to hear how that is working out, plus any
progress on multi-media, the futuristic combination of images, words and
music on CD technology, which has made DK such a glamour stock.
Redland, the construction materials group, reports its interim results on
Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits to about the Pounds 100m
mark, against Pounds 88.5m last time. Behind the increase will lie
reductions in the cost base and the German operations, where success is
continuing apace.
Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, also reports interim profits on
Thursday, with expectations of pre-tax profits of between Pounds 42m and
Pounds 45m. News of the progress of the London hotels will be closely noted.
Further word is awaited on progress in selling the Harvester business.
Worries about a rights issue continue, but the balance of City opinion is
that it is unlikely.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Brown pledges to reverse
'wealth gap'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday pledged to reverse the
'unacceptable' gap between rich and poor which he said had developed over
the past 14 years of Conservative government.
Mr Brown said that redistribution of wealth was a central issue in terms of
social justice and economic efficiency. 'If you're too poor to pay income
tax, you shouldn't have to do so,' he said, 'but if you have the money, the
progressive principle will apply.'
His comments coincided with the launch of his pamphlet on how a new economic
approach could achieve 'full and fulfilling employment'. In calling for
demand management and a readiness to challenge the way the market economy
works in the public interest, it appeared to be a response to internal party
critics who have accused Mr Brown of moving Labour's economic policy too far
to the right.
As part of the programme of immediate action, it recommends a holiday from
national insurance contributions for employers who hire the long-term
unemployed as extra staff.
Speaking on BBC television's On the Record, Mr Brown rejected the suggestion
that in abandoning Labour's taxation policies of the last election he had
lost sight of the party's traditional values.
He said that the gains by a very few people during the 1980s were
'indefensible', and that he would consider a minimum tax rate for the rich,
and changes to tax allowances and to 'boardroom allowances' such as
executive share options.
It was not a matter of marginal tax rates, but looking at changing the basis
of taxation, as the social justice commission was doing. 'The principle is
that people should pay their fair share of taxes,' he added, underlining
Labour's commitment to giving everyone a chance to fulfil their potential.
In his pamphlet, which is reflected in the economic statement to be debated
by the conference today, Mr Brown argues that supply-side measures alone are
not enough to tackle the UK's unemployment, and calls for an 'enhanced
Keynesian approach'.
The short-term programme covers measures such as:
The national insurance 'holiday' for employers taking on the long-term
unemployed.
Environmental initiatives to create jobs in areas such as energy efficiency
and tackling pollution.
Re-training for key occupations in which skills shortages exist.
Longer-term proposals include:
A tax system which rewards employers who provide training, and a training
levy - higher than the previously proposed level - for companies which do
not.
Access to education and training for all young people;
An examination of the entire UK financial system, including pension funds,
the stock exchange and the Bank of England, from the point of view of their
contribution to investment in the UK.
While the tone of the pamphlet marks a shift in Labour's economic thinking,
Mr Brown was still quick to dismiss the call from Mr John Edmonds, the
leader of the GMB union, that borrowing should be increased by Pounds 10bn
as a way to deal with the UK's problems.
Saying Mr Edmonds had 'plucked a figure out of the air', Mr Brown said that
a Labour government would look at investment projects to see if they met the
strict criteria that would justify extra borrowing.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Gould raps leadership on
employment and ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR's failure to develop policies aimed at securing a return to full
employment following the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism
was condemned by Mr Bryan Gould, the former shadow environment secretary.
In speeches to fringe meetings, the Dagenham MP: 'I believe that the Labour
party on this issue is to all intents and purposes brain-dead'.
Mr Gould recalled that he resigned from the shadow cabinet a year ago in
'despair and disbelief' over its decision to back the monetarist strategy
embodied in the Maastricht treaty, He complained that Labour's Treasury team
had still failed to produce a statement on where the party stood in the wake
of the ERM's collapse.
Mr Gould called on the party leadership to end the long retreat in the face
of Thatcherite policies by refusing to accept that Pounds 50bn public sector
borrowing requirement necessitated cuts in social security.
He warned that ministers wanted to gain acceptance for the view that because
benefits were 'too high' many of the unemployed did not take available jobs
thereby exacerbating the deficit problem.
Mr Gould claimed that the Tory objective was to drive down wages, by 'taking
the floor out of the bottom of the labour market'.
He insisted: 'On this issue we must stand and fight - we cannot afford to
allow the Tories to soften up public opinion'.
Mr Gould maintained that enabling people to return to work was the best way
of reducing the PSBR.
He also opposed ending the payment of child benefit to all mothers,
irrespective of whether they needed the money or not. Ending universality
would mean an extension of means testing, and inevitably a large number who
needed help would not get it.
Mr Gould said taxation should be used to get money back from those who did
not need it.
Meanwhile, Conservative party chairman Sir Norman Fowler last night claimed
Labour was still a 'tax and spend' party.
He said the 495 motions submitted for debate by constituency Labour parties
showed 'at heart, Labour remains a party of more government intervention,
higher taxes, vastly increased government spending and reduced choice'.
Labour had failed to convince even its own supporters with its post-election
attempts to 'ditch its image as a 'tax and spend' party and moderate its
policies,' he said.
He highlighted motions calling for renationalisation, the minimum wage,
implementation of the Social Chapter and repeal of Tory trade union laws.
'The majority of motions on spending call for it to be increased and a large
number argue that taxes should be raised for the 'rich',' he said.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Smith unsure of backing in
tense battle on reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a day of union delegation meetings and the publication of the final
motions on party reform it was still not clear last night whether Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, would win Wednesday's vital vote on reforming the
union-party link.
One Labour MP compared the tightness of the vote to the battle between Lord
Healey and Mr Tony Benn for the deputy leadership in 1981. 'The atmosphere
in the party is not as divisive as it was then but the outcome of the vote
is just as important in terms of the perception of the party and its
electability,' said Mr Giles Radice, a strong supporter of the Smith
reforms.
The Smith-backed National Executive Committee rule change, which excludes
the unions from voting in the selection of parliamentary candidates, looks
much more likely to scrape through after the delegation of Nupe, the public
services union, decided to back it last night.
Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, said after a tense
delegation meeting: 'I say to everyone at this conference, do we want to win
the next election? If we want to win it, we want to do it with John Smith as
leader, and that means supporting him now.'
Assuming that two-thirds of constituency parties have also backed the rule
change then it should have just over 50 per cent support.
If fewer than two-thirds of the constituency parties have backed the reform
then the Smith/NEC reform may require the backing of the MSF white-collar
union, or one of the other smaller unions. The MSF last night said it would
decide later in the week.
There are now four main composite motions on offer. Two of them, moved by
the TGWU and GMB general unions, are strongly hostile to the
one-member-one-vote reform. Although they both propose slightly different
alternatives the two unions made clear yesterday they would be supporting
each other.
Nonetheless, neither is expected to win a majority.
A third motion, moved by the loyalist AEEU craft union, is a strong
statement of support for one member one vote and will certainly fail.
A fourth composite, released only yesterday, moved by the RMT rail union and
Nupe, and backed by the NEC, is a complex mixture of positions. It is likely
to be passed - although it will be rejected by the TGWU and GMB.
Speaking at a fringe meeting, Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader,
appealed to Mr Edmonds not to oppose the switch to one-member-one-vote in
the vital debate on Wednesday.
Mr Kinnock said he was certain the change would be approved and dismissed
the whole idea that the campaign for one-member-one-vote was a plot to
exclude trade unionists from the Labour party as a 'fantasy'.

FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Benn may lose in NEC shift to
right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rightward drift of Labour's national executive committee (NEC) is
expected to be confirmed when election results are announced today.
The most prominent left-wing casualty is likely to be Mr Tony Benn, MP for
Chesterfield, who has been a member for 34 consecutive years.
Ironically, the main threat to Mr Benn, 68, stems from the introduction of
positive discrimination in favour of women candidates - a policy to which he
has given his full support.
From this year, one of the seven constituency party seats on the NEC is
reserved for a female candidate as part of Labour's attempts to make the
party more attractive to women. Two of the seven seats will be reserved next
year, and three in 1995.
Mr Benn, who describes himself as 'an old fashioned radical democrat', came
seventh in the constituency section last year, and is considered the most
vulnerable to defeat.
Attention will also focus on the level of support for supporters of the
'modernising' wing, led by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Mr
Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Entrepreneurs complain of bank pains: FT reporters ask why
small businesses find it so difficult to coax banks into lending them money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREDERICK Warren is hopping mad.
He runs a kitchens business in Rayleigh, Essex, with a turnover of Pounds
500,000 a year. Having held an account at National Westminster Bank for 40
years, he has been incensed by the bank's attitude to his effort to agree a
Pounds 7,500 loan to expand his business.
Mr Warren has spent five days this month preparing financial information for
his local bank manager, only to be told that the bank still wants more
details about his seven-employee company, European Kitchens, before agreeing
to lend. 'It's a joke for banks to say they are trying to help small
businesses,' says Mr Warren. He is meeting his bank manager this week for
yet more discussions.
Anecdotes like this have fuelled concern that clearing banks may be adopting
over-rigorous procedures for small-businesses. Mr Eddie George, governor of
the Bank of England, is examining these worries in a probe of small-business
finance that started during the summer.
The health of small businesses will be vital to the recovery. Businesses
with sales of Pounds 1m or less account for more than 95 per cent of all UK
enterprises and a third of the non-government workforce.
The big four clearers - NatWest, Barclays, Midland and Lloyds - are
especially important to the fortunes of Britain's 3m or so small businesses
as 80 per cent of them rely on the banks for short-term finance.
In recent months the nature of the complaints about banks has changed.
During the recession small-business lobby groups criticised them for
increasing charges and reducing credit lines.
The grouses now are that banks are instituting much tougher criteria when
deciding on small-business loans, making the decisions in regional offices
on the basis of financial information rather than on the judgment of local
bank managers who have dealt with clients over many years.
Mr Stephen Alambritis of the 58,000-member Federation of Private Businesses
says: 'Many local bank branches won't talk to people running small
businesses, even when they've got good ideas.'
Mr Charles Burton, partner in the Bradford office of accountants Haines
Watts, specialising in small businesses, says: 'If you have a newish
business or are looking to expand, then the banks are being extremely
sceptical. It's a waste of time putting some ideas to the bank.'
Mr Hikmet Ozkutan runs a petrol station and shop in east London with annual
sales of Pounds 2.2m. Having built up the business tenfold in the past seven
years, Mr Ozkutan has spent two months putting his case to four separate
bank branches for a Pounds 750,000 loan to buy the freehold on his property
and expand his shop. 'I'm depressed that so far I've failed to get a fair
hearing,' he says.
These complaints are supported by at least one branch manager of one of the
big four banks in the north of England who says that head-office controls on
lending have intensified and that 'some of the local managers' discretion
has been eroded'.
Professor David Storey, director of the small and medium-sized enterprise
centre at Warwick University, says that banks have 'a bloody good case' for
tightening controls after large losses in recent years.
But not all small businesses agree that lending conditions have worsened.
Some say the relationship between banks and small companies has eased after
the tensions bred by the recession, when the government launched two
separate studies to determine whether banks were failing to pass on
interest-rate cuts and being too tough with their small-business customers.
'Banks had a strike against lending, but that seems to be over now,' said Mr
Peter Folkman, managing director of North of England Ventures, a
Manchester-based venture-capital fund.
One explanation for banks' reluctance to lend may be a lack of staff trained
to assess small-business risk. Mr Grahame Elliott, a partner at the
Manchester office of accountants Stoy Hayward, says banks in general are
becoming more co-operative towards small businesses. 'The real problem now
is that they don't have enough personnel to understand widely enough how to
assess risk.'
Another problem, according to Mr Richard Brucciani, the Leicester-based
chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's small-firms council, is
that banks largely offer loans secured against fixed assets such as property
rather than against the strength of the business.
He says: 'Reliance on security encourages provision of short-term finance
rather than long-term debt or equity, compounding balance-sheet problems and
overgearing.'
One idea proposed by many in both the banking and the small-business
communities is to build better relationships through such measures as
enrolling more local branch managers as company directors. Mr Sean Henry,
administrative director of Lastolite, a photographic equipment company based
in Coalville, Leicestershire, said: 'In Germany it's quite common for a bank
manager to be on the board. I would welcome that in Britain.'

FT  27 SEP 93 / IoD seeks job cuts in public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should cut public-sector employment by 2 per cent next year -
equivalent to 50,000 jobs - and 5 per cent by 1995-96 to bring its budget
deficit under control, the Institute of Directors said yesterday.
In an attempt to influence the debate that has split the Tories in the
run-up to the November Budget, the institute is backing spending cuts rather
than tax increases.
Its document calls for spending cuts of Pounds 20bn a year by 1995-96. In a
supporting paper, the institute argues that a thorough review of government
spending could save Pounds 100bn a year by 2018-19.
Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director, criticised the government for not
tackling the growing gap between higher government spending and depressed
tax revenues.
The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to reach Pounds 50bn in
the current financial year, 8 per cent of gross domestic product. The
government's March Budget foresaw a deficit of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in
1997-98.
The institute identifies specific areas for savings:
Market testing, competitive tendering and privatisation would cut
public-sector employment.
Individuals who can afford to should pay for services such as health care.
Universal benefits such as child benefit should be abolished, while spending
on invalidity and housing benefits should be cut.
Subsidies to industry should be abolished, including EC food subsidies.
Government holdings of land should be sold off.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Private pay rises 'set to near 4%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE annual private-sector wage rises could approach 4 per cent by the
early months of 1994 if modest economic growth continues, making it more
difficult for the government to restrain public-sector pay increases.
This is the main forecast of the independent body Incomes Data Services in
its survey of pay and bargaining prospects for the 1993-94 pay round,
published today.
It says the growing divergence between pay in the private and the public
sectors will 'create a great deal of catch-up pressure by 1995'.
It suggests that if growth is not sustained because of Continental recession
'we may have a new period of difficulty with awkward decisions for pay
negotiators'.
IDS believes that the retail prices index will be rising at about 4 per cent
a year by early 1994 - affected by inflationary measures which may be
announced in the November Budget, the dropping of last winter's mortgage
rate cuts from the annual measure and increases in taxation and value added
tax next April.
'On balance, upward pressures on pay are expected by many private-sector
negotiators to outweigh downward pressures,' says the report. 'There is not
only concern about the anticipated rise in inflation next year but also that
employee expectations will rise if recovery is firm and profitability
grows.'
The survey adds that the unions are 'worried about the effect on net pay
next April when tax and national insurance increases come into effect.
Without doubt, the government's clampdown on public-sector pay will be
challenged by such upward pressures.'
The report claims that the inflation rate remains 'a dominant consideration
in most pay negotiations or awards'.
IDS points to a number of important private-sector forward commitments in
pay that will produce rises of 3 to 4 per cent. Nissan car company is due to
pay its workers 3.5 per cent rises in January with Peugeot Talbot committed
to paying at least the same rate.
The survey says that private-sector employers see 'employee morale and
motivation as crucial after a prolonged period during which living standards
for many have been restrained or fallen back.'

FT  27 SEP 93 / Golf bash leaves lobsters under par
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISERS of the Ryder Cup were last night clearing up at the Belfry golf
course in Warwickshire after one of the largest corporate entertainment
bashes of the year.
The three-day event, won by the Americans, left some City offices at the end
of last week sparsely staffed - even by Friday afternoon standards. Over
30,000 tickets a day were sold, 7,500 of which were for corporate guests.
On the course as a whole, 10,000 baby lobsters met their fate yesterday,
while 1,000 sides of fresh salmon were dished up over the three days, said
Mr Martin Joyce, the general catering manager. An estimated 35,000 rounds of
sandwiches were eaten, washed down by around 15,000 bottles of wine each
day.
Men favour red over white: the overwhelmingly male nature of the event meant
that champagne consumption lost out heavily to claret.
According to Mr George Griffiths, managing director of Vantage Promotions,
the event rated in hospitality terms 'alongside Silverstone, and was bigger
than Wimbledon and even the Open Championship'.
An estimated worldwide TV audience of 250m tuned in daily and ticket
receipts of over Pounds 2m were expected.

THE government should target more spending on infrastructure projects such
as housebuilding to help construction companies recover from the reccession,
according to Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.
In its budget submission to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the chamber
said capital allowances for the construction industry should be extended and
also called for improved financing arrangements to help smaller companies.

RAIL TRAVELLERS to and from Gatwick airport will be allowed to transfer
tickets between Gatwick Express and Network SouthEast services, in a test
case for the implications of rail privatisation.
As a first step towards privatisation, from this weekend the London to
Gatwick service is to be split into two separate operations. One management
team, acting as a shadow company, will operate the Victoria-Gatwick express
service, while Network SouthEast will introduce a cheaper fare to attract
customers to its slower services on the same route.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Cash for company cars 'falls short'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST CASH alternatives to company cars being offered by employers fall 'far
short' of the actual cost to employees of providing their own cars,
according to a study undertaken by Wyatt, the remuneration consultancy and
actuarial group.
The study adds that 'few employees have a clear idea of how to calculate the
true value of a company car in their personal circumstances'.
Based on an annual survey of 260 companies operating sizeable car fleets, it
concludes that these are two of the main reasons why the number of employees
taking up cash offers is low.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Market reforms 'cut BBC costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC'S controversial producer choice policy has been endorsed by an
evaluation committee including external consultants, Raymond Snoddy writes.
A report to be published next month will conclude that the policy, which
gives producers the freedom to buy services in the outside market, has been
successful in cutting costs.
The one criticism is that the new trading units in the corporation, which
has a licence fee income of about Pounds 1.5bn a year, have generated too
much paperwork. In future producers will be encouraged to rationalise
transactions.
The study shows that there has not been a large exodus to the outside market
by BBC producers.
Before the scheme was implemented on January 1, BBC management forecast that
an average of 15 per cent of BBC work would go to outside suppliers. The
total has been lower. Producers of long-running programmes, for example,
have tended to negotiate long-term deals covering use of BBC studios.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Science schools win funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, will publish plans today to channel
extra funds to secondary schools specialising in technology, mathematics and
science.
The 'technology college' prospectus will confirm proposals made in July.
Under the scheme, schools which can find sponsors for converting to
technology colleges will receive additional funding from the government.
Mr Patten's proposals are likely to provoke more disagreements with
teachers' unions, although the scheme marks a shift away from the City
Technology College initiative in which companies were asked to finance the
building of new colleges.
A report published today by Dr Richard Margrave of the Association of
Teachers and Lecturers says that the 15 CTCs so far built cost the British
taxpayer 'an average of Pounds 7,997 per pupil in capital costs alone in the
period 1987-93'. Capital spending on the colleges has reached Pounds 150m.
Dr Margrave's research also shows that only Pounds 30m, or 20 per cent of
the total, was raised from industry. The government had hoped the private
sector would account for 'all or a substantial part of the capital costs'.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, said today's announcement mark
'the final passing of the old system of incredibly expensive CTC schools'.
He added: 'Any new scheme has to address the issue ofimproving science and
technology facilities in all schools, not just the chosen few.'

FT  27 SEP 93 / Council review to speed up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Gummer, the environment secretary, is expected this week to announce
plans for accelerating the review of local government's structure in England
and Wales.
The review will be completed by the end of next year, it is hoped, in line
with the wishes expressed by Sir John Banham, chairman of the local
government commission for England, in an address to the annual conference of
the Association of Metropolitan Authorities last week.
Sir John has accepted a full-time job as chairman of Tarmac, the
construction company, but has not announced plans to leave the commission.
Provisional plans for restructuring four groups of English counties -
Derbyshire; Cleveland and Durham; North Yorkshire, Humberside and
Lincolnshire; and Somerset, Avon and Gloucestershire - have come up against
strong opposition from local authorities and business leaders.
Counties and districts have so far offered contradictory proposals. But
authorities that have not already been visited by the commission have
started to agree plans to put to the commission. Cambridgeshire district
councils last week agreed estimates of the transition costs involved in six
alternative new structures. All the options would cost at least Pounds 11.7m
initially.
There are complaints that the process, currently scheduled to last until
1997, is too lengthy.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Sinn Fein enters peace process: Tim Coone glimpses the
prospect of political progress in Ulster as bilateral talks raise hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE twists and turns of Northern Ireland's politics are rarely clear and the
finer details tend to escape those who live outside the province.
But a significant event occurred this weekend which will resonate well
beyond the parochial confines of the Belfast or Londonderry City Halls or
the corridors of the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont.
For Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA - which has been
waging a terrorist campaign to effect the withdrawal of Britain from the
province - has now formally entered a process of negotiation to put an end
to the violence.
On Saturday evening Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour
party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, jointly announced that they
are submitting a report to the Irish government on the progress of their
bilateral talks which have been taking place during the past six months. It
is intended that the report will be discussed in Dublin and in London.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was apparently told two weeks ago
that such a development was imminent when he met Mr Hume in Downing Street
on September 16.
Since starting his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, Mr Hume has emphasised
that they are not aimed at achieving a simple ceasefire but are aimed at
bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence'.
Politics in Northern Ireland entered a vacuum in November last year when a
series of round-table talks between the main political parties, initiated in
1991 by Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, broke up
without an agreement. Those talks were overseen by the British and Irish
governments under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, and were
designed to produce a replacement for the 1985 agreement and a new
constitutional framework for the province. Unionist insistence that the
Irish Republic must first drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland as
a basis for continued negotiation was a significant obstacle to progress.
Sinn Fein was excluded from the talks because of its tacit support for the
IRA, and both governments have refused to negotiate with the party until
such time as either Sinn Fein renounces the IRA, or the IRA itself decides
to end its military campaign.
Frustrated with the failure of the round-table talks, Mr Hume then decided
to take a totally different tack. Although the target of much invective and
attacks from the Unionists for embarking upon his negotiation with Mr Adams,
it is significant that neither the Irish nor British governments have
criticised him for doing so.
It is still too early to say that a breakthrough has been achieved in the
Northern Ireland logjam. as Immensely delicate and careful negotiations
remain to be carried out, not least to convince the Unionist parties that
there might be some merit in the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals.
But it is highly significant that Mr Hume is today in the US briefing US
Congressional leaders about his proposals. As an SDLP spokesman said in
Belfast: 'It is not likely that either the British or Irish governments will
talk to Sinn Fein yet, until there is an end to the violence. But that does
not mean they will not talk through an intermediary.'

FT  27 SEP 93 / Settlements system may be run by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is trying to resolve complaints about competing
commercial interests vying for a role in Crest, its new paperless
settlements system, by proposing to run the core of the system itself for
the first few years.
The Bank's Crest committee task force will meet in October to consider a
computer design model of City settlements as they now are and discuss the
way forward.
The committee members include representatives of some of the commercial
interests with the strongest stake in the outcome of the project.
However, the committee is acting in an advisory and informative capacity to
a core of Bank of England staff who will ultimately make the decisions about
the project's specifications. Current proposals, still in the very early
stages, call for a model with a core to be operated by the Bank but allowing
competing commercial vendors to provide other essential services.
Two or three commercial vendors not represented on the committee are said to
be pressing the Bank vigorously for a role in project design.
The system, whose design details are to be presented in irrevocable form
next May, is intended to be a more flexible successor to the ill-fated
Taurus system that the Stock Exchange tried to set up. Committee members are
said to be generally opposed to offering the exchange any central role in
operating the new system.
After a year or two of smooth operation, the Bank would sell its ownership
of the central system, which would provide transfer-of-title functions and
communication of payments information, to the system's users.
Other functions such as electronic trade confirmation, and messaging between
counterparties or registrars could be provided commercially.
Meanwhile, the committee is said to be favouring a design element that is
likely to inflame a portion of the fund management industry which, in
deference to its clients' wishes, keeps the name of each stock certificate
in the individual client's name.
Under the proposal, any fund manager wishing to use the quicker and cheaper
settlements service to be provided by Crest would have to hold clients'
securities in the name of a nominee company. While the majority of
institutional funds are held in nominee name, a significant minority are
not.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Firefighters split on strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WATCH at Southwark fire station in central London is divided about how
to vote in the strike ballot that starts next Monday.
'I can't afford to go on strike,' said Mr Bill Horlock, coming off his
Saturday all-night duty. 'But there is a good cause for one.'
The majority of firefighters at Southwark, as elsewhere in the capital, are
not in a militant mood. 'We don't want to go out of the door,' explained one
of them. 'There is a feeling of despondency here.'
A recent straw poll taken among all the London brigades found a majority
against strike action, though this was less overwhelming a verdict than
earlier in the summer when as many as 70 per cent said they opposed possible
industrial action.
'The real doubt is what will happen to our pay formula next year,' says Mr
Ted Ciplinksi. 'Our employers say we will have it in full but many
firefighters don't trust the government to allow this to happen.
'I've no doubt we would have voted against a strike call before Kenneth
Clarke (the chancellor) announced a second year of public sector wage
restraint. Now we are not so sure.' Mr Horlock agrees. 'We would have
swallowed the pay formula's suspension for a year but we wonder whether the
local authorities will be able to afford to meet the award in 1994 without
borrowing from the government.'
Another Southwark firefighter says: 'Our motto is we will never be rich but
we will also never be poor.' With pay linked to the upper quartile of male
manual earnings since 1978, the fire service is not a pace-setter in pay.
Awards are a catch-up with the private sector. Pay averages just over Pounds
300 a week and firefighters' labour costs make up 2 per cent of local
government's.
But firefighters fear that if they do go on strike, even just for 24 hours,
they will be locked out by their employers.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Lloyd's corporate launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE QUARTER of the shares in a corporate capital fund designed for the
Lloyd's of London insurance market will be aimed at individuals, it has
emerged.
The CLM Insurance Fund, which today becomes the first Lloyd's corporate
capital fund to issue a 'pathfinder' prospectus, plans to target wealthy
individuals as well as institutions.
The emphasis on individual investment comes in spite of the disenchantment
of many Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - who
have lost large sums of money in the past few years.
About 70 Lloyd's syndicates have expressed interest in offering Pounds 250m
in underwriting capacity for the fund, and institutions have so far
tentatively offered to invest up to Pounds 150m to the fund, which will be
in the form of a quoted investment trust. The minimum investment for
individuals will be about Pounds 1,000.
The CLM Fund prospectus says its investments initially will concentrate on
reinsurance, aviation, energy and the motor business.
CLM will invest its money in equities designed to track the overall
performance of the FT-SE index, based on advice from BZW asset management.
The money will also be pledged on Lloyd's syndicates, allocated on advice
from Instrat and Syndicate Analysis Services, both within the Sedgwick
group.
Lloyd's will be able to approve the fund if Names agree to permit the
introduction of corporate capital with limited liability at an extraordinary
general meeting on October 20. The fund also still needs to resolve some tax
issues with the Revenue.
The fund will be chaired by Lord Rees, chairman of Lasmo.

FT  27 SEP 93 / BBC reforms 'cut costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC'S controversial producer choice policy has been endorsed by an
evaluation committee including external consultants.
A report to be published next month will conclude that the policy, which
gives producers the freedom to buy services in the outside market, has been
successful in cutting costs.
The one criticism is that the new trading units in the corporation, which
has a licence fee income of around Pounds 1.5bn a year, have generated too
much paperwork. In future producers will be encouraged to rationalise
transactions.
The study shows that there has not been a large exodus to the outside market
by BBC producers.
Before the scheme was implemented on January 1, BBC management forecast that
an average of 15 per cent of BBC work would go to outside suppliers. The
total has been lower. Producers of long-running programmes, for example,
have tended to negotiate long-term deals covering use of BBC studios.
Although staff jobs have been lost as a result of the introduction of
producer choice, the study suggests that the undermining of the BBC's skills
base, as forecast by some internal critics, has not occurred.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Kuwait 'to review' purchase of stake in BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT said over the weekend that it is to carry out a review of the
'historical background' to its purchase of a 21.7 per cent stake in British
Petroleum in the late 1980s.
It was responding to a report in the Financial Times that it misled the UK
government about the identity of the purchaser of the Dollars 1.7bn BP stake
and may have received Pounds 600m in tax refunds to which it was not
entitled.
The Kuwait Investment Authority, the Kuwait government department in charge
of state investments, said: 'We cannot accept the allegations . . . The
State of Kuwait never had the intention to mislead the British Authorities'.
However, the KIA added: 'In view of the seriousness of the matter and the
fact that it took place over five years ago, the Kuwait Investment Authority
shall make a review of the historical background prior to making any further
comments'.
A KIA official said that he was not sure how long the review would take, but
it could be completed in as little as a week. Though he was not sure whether
the KIA's conclusions would be published in full, he expected a statement to
be made when the review was finished.
The British government will make the 'necessary investigations' into the
report, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said yesterday. But he declined
to comment further on the case, citing the confidentiality that surrounds
relations between the Inland revenue and taxpayers.
A KIA official said that as yet there had been no meetings between Kuwaiti
and British officials to discuss the case.
The FT reported on Friday that the purchaser of the BP stake, which was
bought in late 1987 and early 1988, was the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation,
the Gulf state's national oil company. At the time of purchase, Kuwaiti
officials insisted that the buyer was the Kuwait Investment Office, which is
responsible for Kuwait's international investments, on behalf of the state
fund, the Reserve for Future Generations.
KPC ownership of the shares may mean that more than Pounds 600m of tax
refunds which Kuwait received on income from the BP shares is repayable.
Kuwait received the Pounds 600m of tax credits because the KIO, as an arm of
the Kuwaiti government which makes investments for the state fund, is
treated as a sovereign for tax purposes. Under an international convention,
sovereigns do not pay tax. However, companies set up by issuing shares, such
as KPC, do not qualify for sovereign tax immunity.
Meanwhile BP is in a difficult position. On the one hand, it is concerned to
be given confirmation of the identity of the purchaser of the shares. But it
is equally conscious that one or other Kuwaiti institution is its biggest
shareholder with a 9.7 per cent stake.

FT  27 SEP 93 / TV revenue shows first signs of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST real growth in television advertising revenue for four years is
forecast for this year, with estimates of figures for September showing a
particularly healthy in-crease.
Growth in television is seen as a leading indicator of a more general
recovery in advertising, which in turn reflects increased business
confidence. The figures will raise the hopes of newspapers, magazines and
other advertising media.
September figures for the main commercial channels, ITV and Channel 4, are
likely to show net revenue of Pounds 162m, an increase of more than 11 per
cent on September 1992, says CIA, the independent advertising media buyer.
For 1993 as a whole the group forecasts net revenue of Pounds 1.8bn - up 7
per cent on last year.
Mr Graeme Hutton, CIA's planning director, said TV revenue had been 'flat as
a pancake' for the past four years when inflation was taken into account.
September's figures will be 'much higher than we anticipated', he added.
Zenith Media, the largest buyer of television advertising airtime, has
increased its forecast of advertising growth in all media for 1993 from 1.4
per cent to 2 per cent, and television advertising revenue is expected to
rise from 2.9 per cent to 3.4 per cent. Zenith's figures are for real
growth, with inflation stripped out.
Mr Frank Harrison, Zenith's media research director, said 'there is no doubt
we're out of the recession. Revenues have been up consecutively for most of
this year.'
This growing optimism is shared by advertising agencies. National Economic
Research Associates, an economic consultancy, conducts a monthly survey of
about 30 top agencies on the prospect of television advertising.
In August, for the eighth month in succession, agencies reported to the
consultancy that expectations were 'above normal for the time of year'.
Register-Meal, a survey organisation, reported that particularly strong
areas of television advertising growth for the first half of this year
included motoring, cosmetics and toiletries, travel, and financial services.
Sectors that declined included drinks and confectionery.
Other media lag behind television, explained Mr Hutton, because in uncertain
times advertisers like to plan in the short term. It is possible to place an
advertisement on television at very short notice, while advertising in
monthly magazines requires longer-term planning.
Because of the way the market works, television indicates the level of
increased interest from advertisers more accurately than other media, he
said.
Television has 'an almost infinite capacity to soak up revenue', because
potential advertisers outbid each other for airtime. In contrast, a
newspaper is able to supply only a limited number of extra pages at short
notice to satisfy demand, he said.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Public-sector tenders rule may ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY may relax its insistence on competition in the awarding of
public-sector contracts in a bid to kick-start the government's private
finance initiative.
This is one of three steps ministers are considering to overcome companies'
reluctance to devise schemes for the initiative, which seeks to involve
private capital in public-sector projects.
Companies have been unwilling to commit resources to devising new proposals
as, once adopted, they are required to go to competitive tender for
implementation.
This means that the tender to implement one company's innovation could be
won by a competitor. This partly explains why the initiative has had a slow
start since it was announced in the Autumn Statement.
Under a tentative framework to be set out today by Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, the competition requirement may be
relaxed in 'exceptional' cases where a contract cannot proceed without
access to the physical and intellectual property of a contractor and the
contractor is not willing to grant this to competitors.
This could be done only in cases not covered by European Community
procurement rules requiring competition. A string of conditions would apply,
including that the terms of the contract be published 90 days before it came
into force.
Other steps under consideration by ministers include the offering of
design-only contracts and the partial reimbursement of tendering costs.
This would be limited to no more than half an unsuccessful bidder's expenses
and the bidder would then be required to let others use its intellectual
property.
The Treasury's framework is to be published in the form of a consultation
note, with comments invited by October 29.
The Treasury also suggests that government departments should consider
setting up independent panels of experts to advise on the value of
particular types of intellectual property.
Today's move comes less than three weeks after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, announced the formation of a taskforce representing both public
and private sectors to identify suitable projects and willing investors.
Mr Clarke also promised more guidance for businesses that wanted to invest
in the public sector.

WHOLESALE food markets were warned yesterday that they must improve hygiene
standards and quality control if they are to survive competition from
supermarkets buying direct from producers.
Markets such as New Covent Garden and Smithfield in London are under
pressure to cut costs amid intense competition from food retailers employing
their own farmers.
Opening the annual congress of the World Union of Wholesale Markets, Mr
Geoffrey John, chairman of Food From Britain, the UK farming industry's
promotional agency, said the future of such markets depended on meeting
consumer demands for better hygiene and food quality.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Warning on plan to buy N-arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK needs to reassess its nuclear strategy in the light of new US nuclear
non-proliferation policies, but the British government is not giving
policy-makers enough information to evaluate the options.
This is the conclusion of a report by the British American Security
Information Council, an independent research organisation which analyses
defence policy in Europe and North America, George Graham writes.
The report warns that the UK's plans to upgrade its nuclear arsenal with
modified US-built Trident II missiles, fitted with British warheads, are a
hostage of the US nuclear debate.
Planned British purchases of Trident II missiles could be called into
question as a result of pressure in the US Congress to end production of
unneeded Cold War weapons, while the UK's production of warheads remains
heavily dependent on the US both for design and testing, the council says.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Confident London brokers start to recruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON-BASED securities houses have begun to recruit again, signalling the
end of one of the worst ever periods for jobs in the City.
Headhunters have been given a new lease of life as brokers have begun taking
on staff to cope with a near doubling in investment activity in the past 12
months.
Mr Hugh Hughes, chief executive of Societe Generale Equities International
in London, expects to increase markets staff by about 50 per cent over the
next 12 months. He stressed the strengths of London as a centre for trading
European stocks.
UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, has boosted its research and sales
staff by 10 per cent over this year at an average total salary package of
Pounds 100,000 per person.
Mr Hector Sants, vice-chairman of the securities house, said: 'If you didn't
make money in the first half of this year you probably shouldn't be in
broking.'
City job advertisments in the Financial Times, meanwhile, have increased
threefold since July.
Nomura International, one of the City's biggest firms, has reversed a
decison taken last year to cut staff and has strongly expanded its research
team.
Mr Michael Brookes, deputy managing director, said: 'We see lots of
potential in London. It all depends on the quality of staff.' Nomura has
recruited 20 senior analysts and proprietary traders this year.
Mr Leigh Bruce, head of corporate communications at Salomon Brothers, said:
'We are definitely recruiting more staff. In the past year we have taken on
around 30 full-time staff and a number of consultants.
'The bulk has been back-office staff to deal with the substantial increase
in volume of business we have experienced. But we have also taken a number
of traders and researchers. We now employ 830 full-time.'
City headhunters are also benefiting from the more confident mood. Mrs Fiona
Stephens, managing director of Stephens Associates, said: 'We have seen an
increase in recruitment by market firms and also increasing willingness on
the part of City employees to look at new job opportunities.'
She stressed the growing internationalisation of City recruitment, with
money management groups looking for staff with experience in handling
international portfolios. Mr Hughes said US funds place great store by the
London market, which they use to funnel investment into continental Europe.
There is little sign, however, of a return to the heady days of the
mid-1980s when London was willing to take on beginners at high salaries and
wait for them to prove themselves.
Much of the rebound in recruitment confidence is ascribed to the substantial
improvement in UK equity turnover since sterling's departure from the ERM in
September last year. Prospects in the UK bond market have also strengthened
significantly as the government has returned to debt financing.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Job fears fall despite rising unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS by British workers that they could lose their jobs over the next 12
months have slightly abated, according to the latest monthly survey by MORI
for the Financial Times.
Fear of redundancy or becoming unemployed appears to have decreased over the
past few weeks, in spite of two successive monthly increases in unemployment
and the possibility of job losses in the public sector because of the
government's decision that any pay increases there must be funded by
increased productivity.
Anxiety over the possibility of redundancy peaked in July, according to the
survey, when 51 per cent of those in work said they were either 'very
concerned' or 'fairly concerned'.
The downward trend began in August when 47 per cent expressed this view.
However, in the period up to September 20 the figure had fallen to 43 per
cent of all workers.
Any increase in confidence could flow through to the housing market because
job-loss fear is believed to restrain people from taking on big new
financial commitments.
The groups which had become more optimistic by changing their viewpoint most
over the month were young people, women, part-time workers and people living
in the north of England.
The most anxious were the middle-aged, men, full-time workers and unskilled
manual workers.
Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services, the
independent pay and conditions group which commissioned the survey, said:
'The recent rise in the published unemployment figures, and the possible
impact on public-sector jobs because of the public-sector pay freeze, have
not apparently adversely affected individuals' fear of job loss.'
MORI interviewed 992 adults in full- and part-time work.
UK unemployment will continue to rise during the final months of this year
before falling in 1994, according to the latest forecast from National
Westminster Bank.
The recent slowdown in economic growth has reversed the downward trend in
unemployment, says Mr David Kern, NatWest chief economist.
Registered unemployment fell for four consecutive months earlier in the year
but has since risen by 4,300 in July and 5,800 in August.
Mr Kern expects unemployment to rise by a further 20,000 this year, leaving
the total 50,000 short of its January peak, but then fall by 125,000 in
1994, with the largest proportional falls occurring outside the south-east.
The NatWest forecasts imply a modest fall in the unemployment rate, as a
percentage of the workforce, to 9.9 per cent by the end of next year from
the current level of 10.4 per cent.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Steep profits rise forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS at two of London's leading securities houses are predicting that UK
companies' profits are on course to rise steeply soon, bearing out the
expectations reflected in the stock market's current high ratings.
Their forecasts, based on data on industrial and commercial profits
incorporated in the latest statistics for gross domestic product, are likely
to buttress equity market confidence, which has been unsettled by the trend
of company results for the third quarter.
At Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banking and securities firm, Mr Albert
Edwards predicts 'an avalanche of good company UK profits' in the near
future.
The slackening in domestic demand indicated by the GDP data will also, he
believes, open the way for cuts in UK base rates to 5 per cent or lower.
'This combination of corporate earnings growth and falling interest rates
cannot be matched in other stock markets,' he said.
Mr Edwards, global investment strategist at Kleinwort, recommends increasing
the weighting of equity allocation in the UK market by 10 per cent, largely
at the expense of the Japanese market where he advises a cut of a third.
The strategy team at James Capel, the leading UK institutional stockbroker,
also focuses on the industrial and commercial data, pointing out that while
nominal profits growth may have been lower in the first half of 1993, real
performance has been good.
Mr Adrian Cooper said: 'The interim profits flow is coming in a bit better
than our expectations.
'If this was achieved against a generally dull background, there must be
increasing optimism as economic activity revives more strongly.'
He sees the corporate profit share of GDP as likely to rise through its
late-1980s peak, and a possible fall in base rates to 4 1/2 per cent by the
end of next year.
The London stock market currently rates UK companies at up to 21 times their
last-year profits, implying that share prices depend heavily on improved
profits over the next 12 months.
Capel is now predicting nominal growth in industrial and commercial profits
of around 16 per cent both this year and next.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Portillo lends his support to Thatcherite group's agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THATCHERITE group has enlisted the support of Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief Treasury secretary, in setting out its alternative agenda in the
run-up to the Tory party conference.
Mr Portillo has contributed an article to Conservative Way Forward's
quarterly magazine. The next issue is expected in time for next week's
conference in Blackpool.
The article is thought to steer clear of the current argument within the
party over tax and spending. But further high-profile ministerial support
for the group could undermine party managers' hopes that conference will
provide the basis for a political revival at a time when prime minister John
Major is under severe pressure to reassert his leadership credentials.
It has already emerged that three ministers, including Mr Peter Lilley,
Social Security Secretary, are to speak at conference meetings organised by
Conservative Way Forward.
The magazine's most recent issue in August contained a vigorous attack on Mr
Major's leadership from Lord Parkinson, the Conservative Way Forward
chairman.
Mr Portillo's article is expected to focus on the long-term, setting out a
Conservative agenda for the 1990s aimed at building on the last decade's
achievements to further reduce the size of the public sector and empower
individuals.
Mr Major is expected to use the conference to force a show-down with
right-wing rebels.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Delay likely for Jordan multi-party poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN of Jordan strongly hinted at the weekend that he will postpone
the kingdom's first multi-party elections, but said he hoped they could be
held within 'a few months' - perhaps at the same time as elections under the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, Mark Nicholson and James Whittington report
from Amman.
The king told foreign correspondents at a palace dinner that he would
announce a decision on whether to proceed with the November 8 poll by
Wednesday. He said no decision had been reached, but 'there is a likelihood
of a postponement for a limited period of time.'
Campaigning was well under way when the Palestinians and Israel announced
their surprise deal on mutual recognition and limited self-rule in the
occupied territories late last month. The breakthrough threw Jordan's plans
into confusion by raising the question of how many of Jordan's hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians would be eligible to vote in the Palestinian poll
 -and whether they should be permitted to vote both there and in Jordan.
King Hussein said those Jordanian Palestinians eligible to return to the
occupied territories could choose where to vote, but stressed that 'if a
Jordanian votes for the Palestinian self-rule authority, he cannot vote
here'. He emphasised that Palestinians wishing to remain, and vote, in
Jordan would be able to do so.
King Hussein, however, appears anxious that any postponement should not be
seen as diminishing his commitment to enlarging democracy in Jordan. He said
he hoped the poll could be held 'simultaneously with, or shortly after', the
Palestinian election, due by next July.
King Hussein said a decision on postponement would be reached only after
consultation with all political factions. Many East Bankers -
non-Palestinian Jordanians - are keen to delay the poll until it is clear
how many Palestinians will return to the occupied territories. Jordanians of
Palestinian origin constitute a substantial majority of the kingdom's 4m
people.
The king characterised the Palestinian-Israeli deal as the sole option for
peace in the region. He did not disguise his shock at not having been
consulted during PLO-Israeli talks, but saw no alternative to backing the
deal. 'I could have scuttled the deal very easily but I could not have lived
with myself,' he said.

BRITISH Prime Minister John Major said last night he would welcome South
Africa back into the Commonwealth, the Press Association reports.
In a statement issued after a meeting in London with President F W de Klerk,
Mr Major said South Africa was 'firmly on the road towards full, non-racial
democracy'.
'The progress made within South Africa has opened the way for her to take
her place in the international community,' he said. 'The question of South
Africa's relationship with the Commonwealth will be one for a future South
African government and for the Commonwealth as a whole to decide.'
South Africa became a republic and withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961.
Mr de Klerk arrived in Britain earlier in the day from Washington, where he
called for international financial aid and corporate investment to develop
fully South Africa's natural resources and help move the country toward a
multiracial democracy.
Mr Major backed Mr de Klerk's call for investment, saying: 'We shall support
lending by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to South
Africa. I warmly welcome the lifting of economic sanctions. The South
African economy has huge potential. Outside help to regenerate it and create
more jobs will be vital to the transitional process.'
Mozambique and South Africa have agreed to establish diplomatic relations
with immediate effect, Mozambican state radio and television reported
yesterday, Reuter reports from Maputo

MR YASUSHI AKASHI, the Japanese diplomat in charge of the United Nations'
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, left Phnom
Penh yesterday expressing satisfaction at the broad success of his mission
but regret that Khmer Rouge guerrillas were still challenging the authority
of the new government, Victor Mallet writes from Bangkok.
Mr Akashi and his colleagues in the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
have also urged foreign donors to support the country financially after the
two-year UN mission.
Mr Sam Rainsy, the Cambodian finance minister, left for Washington yesterday
to negotiate with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Donors have pledged Dollars 1bn to Cambodia, but little of the money has
been disbursed. UN officials fear the local currency may collapse with the
disappearance of the dollars previously spent by UN staff.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Opec talks stumble over quotas for Kuwait, Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE allocation of new production quotas to Kuwait and Iran emerged last
night as one of the main stumbling blocks facing oil ministers of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in their attempts to halt the
recent slide in oil prices.
The 13 ministers will meet in closed session in Geneva this morning to
review progress made so far in talks aimed at setting a new overall
production ceiling and quota allocations to individual Opec states.
An Iranian delegate last night dismissed a quota figure proposed for Iran as
'far away' from that which the Tehran government wanted.
Iran is understood to object to special treatment for Kuwait, which left the
production ceiling earlier this year after unsuccessfully demanding parity
with the United Arab Emirates.
According to one Arab delegate, Iran wants a similar percentage increase to
that which might be offered to Kuwait. He suggested Kuwait might drop its
parity demand if it won an allocation of close to 2m barrels per day.
Yesterday a sub-committee of 'three wise men' plus Mr Subroto, the
Indonesian secretary general of Opec, met the Saudi Arabian, Iranian,
Nigerian and Algerian delegations in a series of bilateral meetings. They
are due to meet Kuwait officials before today's full ministerial meeting, at
which time the 'wise men' may propose a new production ceiling to replace
the existing one of 23.5m b/d.
The ceiling has been widely ignored by a number of Opec states, whose
over-production has combined with low demand and the prospect of growing
output from other sources, including the North Sea, to drive down prices.
A Gulf Arab delegate said the 'desired ceiling was in the range of 24m-24.5m
b/d, the level of recent Opec production.
He suggested the market could bear an Opec ceiling as high as 25m b/d, but
conceded that it would not improve prices, a priority for all member states.
Analysts say any successful agreement would require Saudi Arabia to maintain
or even cut its output.

Syria called yesterday for the tightening of the 40-year-old Arab economic
boycott against Israel, accusing it of asking for everything in the Middle
East peace process in return for nothing, Reuter reports from Damascus. The
government newspaper Tishreen and state-run Damascus radio said the boycott
could not be abolished before restoration of Arab rights and the recovery of
occupied Arab lands.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Oil talks aim to stop price slide

OIL MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
yesterday continued talks in Geneva aimed at setting future production
levels which they hope will halt the slide in oil prices.
Dr Subroto, the Indonesian secretary general of Opec, denied that specific
output figures had been discussed by the 13 oil ministers, who began their
official deliberations on Saturday. But he hoped a 'firm consensus on where
the ceiling should be' would emerge during a second round of meetings
between a sub-committee of 'three wise men' and the various delegations
which began yesterday.
A meeting of all 13 ministers is scheduled to be held today.
A production ceiling of 23.5m barrels a day was agreed in June, but cheating
by some producers resulted in third-quarter output at least 1m b/d higher.
Opec overproduction and the prospect of rising output from other sources,
including the North Sea, has caused the Opec basket price - the average of
prices from seven Opec countries - to fall to just over Dollars 15 from
Dollars 18 in April.
In his opening speech on Saturday, Mr Jean Ping, the Gabon oil minister and
current president of Opec, issued a blunt warning of the dangers of failing
to agree on a 'credible' fourth-quarter output ceiling and an allocation of
it that satisfied members, all of which are keen to increase revenues.
'The current state of the market gives us no room to manoeuvre,' he said.
'We cannot sustain another oil collapse such as the one in 1986.'

FT  27 SEP 93 / Satisfied UN ends Cambodia mission: Fears of currency
collapse and continuing Khmer Rouge influence

MR YASUSHI AKASHI, the Japanese diplomat in charge of the United Nations'
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, left Phnom
Penh yesterday expressing satisfaction at the broad success of his mission
but regret that Khmer Rouge guerrillas were still challenging the authority
of the new government.
Mr Akashi and his colleagues in the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
have also urged foreign donors to support the country financially in the
aftermath of the two-year UN mission.
Mr Sam Rainsy, the Cambodian finance minister, left for Washington yesterday
to negotiate a Dollars 64m (Pounds 41.5m) loan agreement with the World Bank
and Dollars 9m more in short-term financing from the International Monetary
Fund.
Donors have pledged a total of Dollars 1bn to Cambodia, but little of the
money has been disbursed. UN officials fear the local currency may collapse
with the disappearance of the dollars previously spent by UN staff.
Speaking at the airport with tears in his eyes, Mr Akashi said: 'The memory
of the Cambodians and our valiant struggle together for peace will forever
be inscribed in my mind and in my heart.'
The UN, which deployed 22,000 soldiers and civilians in Cambodia at the time
of the UN-organised elections in May, is expected to grant a Cambodian
request for 30 UN military observers to remain in the country.
A UN office in Phnom Penh will also continue to help clear the millions of
land-mines littering the country after two decades of war, and will be
responsible for a human rights office in Cambodia - a new departure for the
UN.
Gen Charan Kullavanich, Thailand's national security council chief, was
meanwhile quoted in the Thai press as expressing regret that international
forces were departing from Cambodia without having brought peace and
'leaving behind an unsolved mess for Thailand to confront'.
UN officials regard this as an outrageous comment from a government which
has flagrantly violated the 1991 Cambodian peace accord (of which Thailand
was a signatory) by supporting the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge refused to
disarm its fighters and boycotted the election.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Crescent Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On March 8 and 11 of this year, the Financial Times reported that Mr Robin
Cook, the shadow spokesman on trade and industry, had raised parliamentary
questions calling for Crescent Petroleum Company International, the
Gulf-based oil company, to be investigated on account of alleged improper
links with the State of Iraq.
In fact, Mr Cook raised no such questions, and the Financial Times was
mistaken to state that he had.
It was not the intention of the Financial Times to suggest in any way that
the company had breached sanctions against Iraq, or that it had any improper
links whatsoever with Iraq. The Financial Times now recognises that a
contrary impression might have been conveyed, and apologises unreservedly to
Crescent Petroleum for any damage or inconvenience caused by its report.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Japanese companies slash their costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the Japanese car maker, is planning to cut costs by at least Y100bn
(Pounds 613m) this fiscal year, in an ambitious exercise designed to combat
the impact of the yen's sharp appreciation and stagnant demand in the
Japanese car market, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo.
If successful, the efforts by Toyota to slash its costs will take the total
amount of cost cuts in fiscal 1993 and 1994 to Y200bn.
Toyota said its cost reductions last year, which represented about 1 per
cent of its total cost of sales, had been a main contributor to the Y322bn
pre-tax profits it made in the year to June 30.
To achieve its goal Toyota has set up several committees, each headed by an
executive and involving several hundred employees, from purchasing to
distribution and administration staff, as well as executives at its
components suppliers. So far the company estimates its efforts have enabled
it to shave off about 3 per cent of the costs of making each car.
The fervour with which Toyota, widely recognised as one of the world's most
efficient manufacturers, has taken to cutting costs reflects the
difficulties Japanese manufacturers and exporters face amid the country's
economic slowdown, a sharp appreciation of the yen and spread-ing gloom
about future pros-pects.
Toyota, in common with a growing number of Japanese corporations, is also
adjusting its employment structure to try to survive through the difficult
environment. It has sent 175 employees to a subcontractor from this month.
Others are being forced to take more drastic action. Honda said it was
reducing the number of its employees by 3,000 over the next three years
through natural attrition and by reducing the number of new recruits.
Honda's decision is being forced on it by the need to reduce production in
Japan due to the fall in domestic demand and the difficulty of remaining
competitive in a high yen environment.
It will end a shift at one line in its Suzuka factory from October 1 and cut
the other line to one shift next April. This is in addition to a reduction
of output at another factory near Tokyo. Production of its mainline Accord
and Civic models bound for the US market will be shifted almost entirely
from Japan to the US.
The electronics industry is facing a similar need to shift production
overseas, as well as to adjust employment levels.
JVC became the latest company to announce a reduction in employees. The
maker of audio-visual equipment will shed 2,000 employees by the end of next
September, after reducing staff by 3,000 last year.
Alps Electric, which makes components for most of the big electronics
companies, is looking for cuts of 1,600 through voluntary retirement.
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, has sent 2,000
employees to its affiliated retail shops.
The moves are increasing concerns that Japanese industry could be hollowing
out by losing jobs abroad.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported in a recent study
that a 10 per cent fall in exports would lead to a 1.2 per cent fall in GDP,
a 2.1 per cent fall in manufacturing output and a surplus in the workforce
of 470,000.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Hope for fresh start in Japan-US relations: Hosokawa's trip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, is to meet US President
Bill Clinton today for what officials hope will be a fresh start to strained
US-Japan relations.
The meeting, their first since Mr Hosokawa became prime minister seven weeks
ago, will allow them to review relations following the end of 38 years of
rule by the Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Hosokawa will also address the United Nations General Assembly today, and
he is expected to apologise for Japan's actions in the second world war, the
first time he will have done so in a foreign setting.
The move is part of the new government's efforts to plot out a larger
Japanese role in international affairs. But at the same time, Mr Hosokawa is
expected to be non-committal on Japanese approaches for permanent membership
of the UN Security Council, because of opposition from the pacifist Social
Democratic party, the largest in the seven-party coalition.
Both sides' main objective for Mr Hosokawa's hour-long meeting with Mr
Clinton is to build personal confidence and discuss broad issues, rather
than detail.
Mr Hosokawa will explain his political and economic reform policies and
discuss foreign policy co-operation on Russia, the Middle East, China and
North Korea. He also hopes to discuss plans to reform the UN, though
officials accept that it is unlikely that they will get through the whole
agenda in such a brief encounter.
Japanese officials believe strains with the US have been eased by the steps
Tokyo has taken in the past few weeks to try to revive the economy, partly
in response to pressure from Washington.
These include plans to cut administrative red tape, a Y6,150bn (Pounds
37.7bn) public spending package and a  3/4 -point cut in the Bank of Japan's
official discount rate to a new low of 1.75 per cent.
US officials are disappointed that the new government has not cut income
tax, but this is politically difficult for Mr Hosokawa. Meanwhile,
two-week-old talks on mapping out the 'framework agreement' reached at the
Tokyo economic summit last July have yet to make significant progress on
ways for Japan to reduce its surplus by opening markets to foreign
competition.
Mr Hosokawa claimed on Friday that Tokyo and Washington had agreed there
would be no attempt to set a numerically targeted cut in Japan's record
current account surplus, a big irritant to relations. The surplus hit
Dollars 117.55bn (Pounds 76.3bn), or 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product,
last year, a factor in the yen's rise of nearly 20 per cent against the
dollar since January.
'Concerning the surplus, Japan and the US have agreed not to set numerical
targets,' Mr Hosokawa told the upper house of parliament. 'It is not
appropriate for the government to set specific targets because the surplus
cannot be adjusted freely by just structural changes in one country.'
Foreign Ministry officials, however, pointed out that this was in line with
the original agreement at the Tokyo summit. The issue has given rise to
numerous misunderstandings on both sides, but US officials in Tokyo had no
comment.
Tokyo's policy on this was plunged into confusion last week when Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the foreign minister, suggested Japan should soften its opposition to
targets.
This was welcomed by Japanese business groups, which believe the dispute
with the US on the current account surplus has contributed to the yen's
rise.
Mr Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japanese association of corporate
executives, yesterday became the latest business leader to suggest that
Japan should try to reduce the current account surplus to 2 per cent of GDP
in the medium term. However, as Mr Hosokawa reminded parliament, the
government is officially sticking to its opposition to precise targets.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Lurking threat of a first world debt crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IS THE Debt Crisis Over?' the International Monetary Fund asks in a
supplementary chapter to its latest World Economic Outlook. But which debt
crisis is really on the Fund's mind?
Ask finance ministers from sub-Saharan Africa whether their debt crisis is
over and the answer would be an emphatic No. For, as the IMF also points
out, interest and amortisation payments now consume nearly a quarter of the
continent's export earnings every year, far higher than in any other region
of the world.
The IMF says that heavily indebted, low-income countries need substantial
debt reduction. Oxfam, the international aid agency, advocates debt relief
using the Trinidad terms, which allow for a two-thirds debt reduction. The
World Bank says, in private, that even this does not go far enough. So far,
sub-Saharan debt relief has not gone very far at all.
But ask a group of bankers in New York and London whether the third world
debt crisis is over and the answer will be a relieved Yes. Countries
accounting for about 80 per cent of the commercial bank debt which had to be
rescheduled in the 1980s have now participated in debt restructuring. These
have lowered the net present value of repayments by a third, while banks
have made provision to cover their remaining exposure. The international
financial system, the IMF concludes, is no longer at risk from a widespread
third world debt default.
Yet, as this risk has receded, so others have taken its place. While
commercial banks were removing third world debts from their balance sheets
in the late 1980s, they were simultaneously engaging in another bout of
speculative lending, this time to consumers and property developers in
London and Tokyo and across the US. Once more, a rise in world interest
rates turned many of these loans into bad debts, this time with much more
severe effects on developed-country growth.
The hangover from the debt binge of the late 1980s helps explain why the IMF
is now exercised by the threat of a new debt crisis. For the combination of
public spending pressures, high interest rates and persistently slow growth
has produced large budget deficits in many developed countries, particularly
in Europe. The combined budget deficit of European Community members is
expected to be 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product this year. The US
budget deficit peaked in the 1980s at only 4.1 per cent of GDP.
Judging whether developed-country fiscal policies are sustainable is a
tricky business. Governments, unlike private individuals, cannot actually go
bankrupt, and even severely indebted developed-country governments have
still been able to borrow from the capital markets. But, as the IMF points
out, the share of net public debt in GDP can only rise for so long before
troubles begin.
A rising debt-GDP ratio means a growing share of interest payments in the
budget, making the government increasingly vulnerable to a sharp rise in
interest rates if the capital markets start to worry that the government
might be tempted to inflate away the debt, as Italy and more recently
Belgium have discovered.
The IMF has calculated the budget deficits that developed-country
governments would need in order to stabilise their net debt ratios, given
projected growth rates and real interest rates. The chart compares these
calculations, both this year and in 1998, to the actual deficits that the
IMF expects to prevail.
The message is clear. Japan has no fiscal difficulties, while Italy and the
US plan actions which should bring debt ratios under control by 1998. But
Germany, France and the UK all face medium-term deficits which imply rising
debt ratios. The UK, in particular, is on an explosive course: by 1998, its
budget deficit is expected to remain more than twice as great as that needed
to stabilise its debt ratio.
Little wonder the IMF privately fears that the debt threat is moving north.
These days it is the build-up of first world debt, not Africa's lingering
crisis, that haunts the sleep of IMF officials.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Hussein set to postpone Jordan's multi-party poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and JAMES WHITTINGTON

<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN of Jordan strongly hinted at the weekend that he will postpone
the kingdom's first multi-party elections, but said he hoped they could be
held within 'a few months' - perhaps at the same time as elections under the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
The king told foreign correspondents at a palace dinner that he would
announce a decision on whether to proceed with the November 8 poll by
Wednesday. He said no decision had been reached, but added: 'There is a
likelihood of a postponement for a limited period of time.'
Campaigning was well under way when the Palestinians and Israel announced
their surprise deal on mutual recognition and limited self-rule in the
occupied territories late last month. The breakthrough threw Jordan's plans
into confusion by raising the question of how many of Jordan's hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians would be eligible to vote in the Palestinian poll
 -and whether they should be permitted to vote both there and in Jordan.
King Hussein said those Jordanian Palestinians eligible to return to the
occupied territories could choose where to vote, but stressed that 'if a
Jordanian votes for the Palestinian self-rule authority, he cannot vote
here'. He emphasised that Palestinians wishing to remain, and vote, in
Jordan would be able to do so.
The king said he did not wish the election to become a referendum on the
PLO-Israeli deal. Many Jordanians fear this risks dividing the country while
details, such as the number of Jordanian Palestinians eligible for return to
the occupied territories, remain unsettled. 'We have great concern that the
election campaign will disintegrate into whoever is for and whoever is
against what has happened,' he said.
King Hussein, however, appears anxious that any postponement should not be
seen as diminishing his commitment to enlarging democracy in Jordan. He said
he hoped the poll could be held 'simultaneously with, or shortly after' the
Palestinian election, which is due by next July.
King Hussein said such a decision would be reached only after consultation
with all political factions. Many East Bankers - non-Palestinian Jordanians
 -are keen to postpone the poll until it is clear how many Palestinians will
return to the occupied territories. Jordanians of Palestinian origin
constitute a substantial majority of the kingdom's 4m people.
The king characterised the Palestinian-Israeli deal as the sole option for
peace in the region. He did not disguise his shock at not having been
consulted during PLO-Israeli talks, but saw no alternative to backing the
deal. 'I could have scuttled the deal very easily but I could not have lived
with myself,' he said.
He said he hoped to see progress soon on the Israeli-Syrian track of the
peace talks to follow Jordan's agreement on a joint 'agenda' of principles
to guide their bilateral talks. But he stressed that Jordan would not await
progress on the Syrian track before progressing substantively on its talks
with Israel. 'It doesn't keep us from moving ahead at all,' he said.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Brittan starts hunt for concessions: Sir Leon has to get
some sort of deal for France on farm trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will be in an unenviable
position when today in Washington he meets Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, to try to agree on a compatible EC-US agenda for concluding
the seven-year-old Uruguay Round world trade reform talks.
Sir Leon has to get some sort of deal for France on farm trade, in the
knowledge that failure to deliver apparent US concessions may well sink the
Gatt round and embroil the EC in a profound internal crisis. But US
flexibility on farm trade, if at all possible, will very likely come at the
expense of EC settling for less in other areas of the trade talks, such as
access to the US financial services market.
So what margin for manoeuvre does Sir Leon have?
First, it lies in American willingness to be flexible on some of the details
of Blair House.
Second, political presentation of any eventual deal will depend on the fact
that the details of Blair House are not widely known - especially, Paris
appears to be assuming, in France.
Paris demands that food aid should be exempt from the 21 per cent cut over
six years in subsidised food exports prescribed by Blair House, which is
France's main concern about the agreement. Food aid, however, is already
exempt from the Blair House curbs.
Whether Sir Leon can get any concessions at all, however, is far from
assured.
France's overall aim is to ensure that the 21 per cent cuts on subsidised
food exports never have to be made. Last year's reform of the EC's Common
Agricultural Policy introduced big price cuts and restraints on
overproduction. The European Commission maintains that by around mid-way
through the Gatt/Blair House timetable, EC prices will as a result dip to
around world market levels - making export subsidies and therefore the Blair
House cuts superfluous, and EC prices competitive not only abroad but
against imports.
The US and other agri-exporters do not take these estimates on faith, and
nor does France, although it signed up to CAP reform in May 1992. Although
France could not then, and can not now, say this publicly, French officials
privately admit that their main concern was that the CAP reform did not cut
prices enough. If EC prices are still above world level when the CAP reform
cuts have run their course (at the end of 1996) and a Gatt deal on farm
trade comes on stream (probably around mid-1995) French subsidised exports
will be hit.
The alternatives would be to dispense with the export subsidies anyway, or
drop EC prices further. Blair House allows full compensation to farmers for
price cuts, but Paris appears politically unwilling to risk either of these
options, much less proclaim them as solutions to France's militant farmers.
What the French therefore appear to want Sir Leon to concentrate on with the
Americans is so-called 'front-loading' and food stocks. There may just be
room for settlement on these two issues.
On 'front-loading,' the Uruguay Round draft agreement or 'final act' calls
for the 21 per cent export volume curbs to be made evenly, at about 3.5 per
cent a year, over the six years. But the 'final act' is still a draft, open
to some modification. France wants to be able to shift the cuts to the end
of the timetable, in the hope they will not have to be made at all. France's
attempt to get the EC's food mountains exempted from the curbs is directly
linked to this. Flexibility on timing would allow the EC to get rid of its
stocks without running into the export curbs.
Blair House was originally vague on this problem. But EC negotiators have
told the FT that a subsequent EC-US memorandum established a formula,
requiring full cuts in the first and sixth years of the accord, with freedom
to postpone cuts during intervening years, provided these are 'paid back'
within no more than a year. Interpretations of this vary.
One of the main negotiators of Blair House says 'it really means equal
amounts' to be cut each year. Another says 'if the Americans want to be
helpful, that is an area in which we can resolve this.'
If Sir Leon can get some movement in this area, the Commission and France's
partners must also work to help Paris dress up any eventual deal.
It is not widely appreciated, for instance, that Blair House will require
the US to cut its wheat exports from 19.7m tonnes to 14m tonnes.
Moreover, both US and EC negotiators of Blair House believe that it 'gives
less access to the Community market than was the case last year,' as one
European negotiator put it.
On stocks, the underlying rise in EC grain stockpiles is running at about
half the level prior to CAP reform; French officials are at the moment
choosing to dramatise the stocks figures by ignoring seasonal trends and
developments since CAP price and output cuts started to bite this summer.
One of the EC architects of Blair House maintains, furthermore, that the
'worst case scenario' drawn up by independent economists - premised on
annual 1 per cent grain yield increases nullifying part of the CAP reform
restraints - 'still leaves us on the wrong side of the Gatt limits for
(exporting subsidised) bread-making wheat by only 1m to 1.5m tonnes - and
that can be given out as food aid.'

France must avoid protectionist responses to the problems of recession and
rising unemployment, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, warned at the
weekend, John Ridding reports from Paris.
Speaking at a conference of parliamentarians from the RPR party, the
dominant partner of the ruling centre-right coalition government, Mr Juppe
described protectionism as one of the main threats to jobs in France.
Unemployment, currently at 11.7 per cent of the workforce, is expected to
exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year.
The French government has been accused of a protectionist stance by
international trading partners as result of its position on agricultural
trade. In particular, France is demanding changes to an EC-US agricultural
deal which is crucial to completing an agreement on the Uruguay Round of
international trade negotiations. At their weekend meeting at the western
port of La Rochelle, RPR lawmakers voted unanimously in support of a motion
calling on the government to veto any agricultural agreement which damaged
French interests.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Taiwan company to clone Intel chip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN's top semiconductor manufacturer plans to launch a clone of the top
selling Intel microprocessor chip, the brains of most personal computers. A
legal battle, which may take on nationalistic tones, seems likely to ensue.
United Microelectronics, Taiwan's flagship chipmaker formed in 1980 with
government support, says it will introduce a 486SX microprocessor chip next
month, with a higher performance 486DX chip to follow next year. UMC plans
to sell the chips only to non-US customers to avoid legal problems with
Intel, which is vigorously defending its intellectual property rights
against other efforts to clone its microprocessors by Advanced Micro Devices
and Cyrix , both of the US.
Avoiding the US market may not, however, protect UMC if Intel determines
that UMC has copied its technology. Intel holds world patents and copyrights
protecting all its products the US company said.
UMC's move reflects Taiwan's ambitions to become a fully-fledged producer of
computers and other electronics product, rather than an assembly site for
US, Japanese and European-branded PCs using components manufactured mainly
in the US and Japan.
Encouraged by the Taiwan government, UMC is attempting to reduce the
dependence of the country's fast-growing electronics industry on foreign
component suppliers. Already the company produces memory chips and several
other semiconductor devices for the PC market. Some 75 per cent of its chips
are sold to Taiwan-based companies although most are ultimately exported in
finished goods or sub-assemblies.
UMC is not expected to put a serious dent in Intel's microprocessor sales.
The company has limited production capacity and is forecasting revenues of
about Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) this year, up from an estimated Dollars
250m in 1992, but a far cry from Intel's Dollars 5.8bn 1992 revenues.
However, the Taiwanese company is about to begin building a manufacturing
facility that will more than double its output when completed in about two
years. Moreover, UMC is well placed to usurp Intel's near monopoly of the
world PC microprocessor market.
Over the past five years Taiwan's production of PCs and the main circuit
boards that power them has expanded rapidly. Taiwan now produces almost 70
per cent of all PC circuit boards, making it Intel's biggest market. If UMC
succeeds in the microprocessor market, others might be encouraged to follow
suit.
Intel's response to UMC's introduction of 486-clones could also be critical
to the development of Taiwan's electronics industry, the highest growth
segment of its economy. The US company's ownership of the core technology
for PCs represents a serious barrier to Taiwan's ambitions to 'move up the
value chain' in the information technology industry.
This objective - established by the government as a central element of its
industrial policy - has been backed by heavy government spending on research
and development. Taiwan's Information Technology Research Institute has an
annual budget of Dollars 450m.
Thus a legal challenge aimed at UMC by Intel would amount to an attack on
Taiwan's industrial development in the eyes of many Taiwanese. Emotions are
fuelled by the resentment that already exists among Taiwan's PC circuit
board producers towards the US company, which they charge has bullied them
into paying high prices and threatened to cut off supplies of critical
components if they purchase microprocessor 'clones'.
These feelings have been exacerbated by a trade complaint, filed in the US
by Intel against one of Taiwan's PC producers. Intel charges that Twinhead
of Taiwan which makes PCs based on AMD's clone microprocessors, is selling
PCs in the US that infringe its intellectual property rights. ITRI has
stepped in to help defend Twinhead.
A legal battle between Intel and UMC could also undermine Taiwan's efforts
to prove that it has made significant progress in implementing new laws to
protect intellectual property rights as it seeks membership of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Intel executives are sceptical that UMC can actually produce 486-compatible
chips.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Spain prepares for austerity budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S minority socialist government will this week present to parliament
the country's most restrictive budget in a decade, in a clear signal to the
trades unions that efforts to trim the state's runaway deficits are being
given priority over any quick fixes for Spain's record number of unemployed.
The cabinet approved the draft 1994 budget at the weekend and officials were
later insisting, despite scepticism from the opposition, that it was not
alterable.
This means that, after three weeks of fruitless talking to the unions on the
terms of a 'social pact' - an effort to develop a common front on pulling
the country out of recession - the government has had to impose a series of
budgetary targets it had initially hoped to reach by negotiation.
Officials say three measures being negotiated with the unions - a freeze in
civil service pay for 1994, a limit of 3.5 per cent in state pension
increases for next year and cuts in the budget of the employment benefits -
are now set in stone. Almost Pta300bn (Pounds 1.52bn) has been trimmed from
Inem, the national employment institute which funds benefits.
The unions, which last year called an unsuccessful strike in protest at
earlier cuts in benefits, appear to have miscalculated again. 'The unions
only hear what they want to hear,' said Mr Pedro Solbes, the finance
minister, after Friday's cabinet meeting. 'We have been telling them since
August that we had until now, today, to solve our deficit problems.'
Nevertheless the government hopes to resume taking to the unions, and
employers, early next week about a wider pay agreement. Madrid is looking
for a three-year wage moderation pact (under which employers would restrict
dividend payments and raise investment) crucial to the credibility of the
recovery programme it is trying to construct.
These broader talks will be made more difficult by the budget and the
realisation by the unions that they may have been outsmarted. 'The unions
thought that if they promised to talk to us later about a global (private
and public sector) wages deal, we would be prepared to give way on pension,
benefits and the civil service freeze in the budget,' said a senior Finance
Ministry official.
'But we were saying the opposite. If we go on now and get a global
three-year agreement to moderate wages by the end of November, we are saying
that we may ease some of our criteria. But only after 1994.'
On the surface at least, the government is being uncommonly tough. Once the
budget is presented, the upper and lower houses of parliament have until the
end of the year to debate it and sceptics will be watching not the unions
but the Catalan party, the CiU, to dent the government fiscal resolve.
Mr Gonzalez needs CiU support to pass the budget but the Catalans are
balking.
Primarily, the Catalans want agreement from Madrid that 15 per cent of the
income tax raised by the central government should be given to the
government of the region in which it was raised. Madrid agrees but there are
arguments about how. Poor regions claim Catalonia will become progressively
richer. The CiU, not without cause, worries about the speed at which Madrid
would implement this new system.
In reality the CiU should have little problem supporting the budget. Mr
Solbes has tried to present a more realistic set of targets than had become
common under his more ebullient predecessor, Mr Carlos Solchaga, even though
his 1994 growth forecast of 1.3 per cent may look optimistic after an
expected decline in GDP this year of 0.8 per cent. Even at 1.3 per cent
growth, though, Spain will not create jobs.
Mr Solbes has also committed himself to an annual inflation target of 3.5
per cent for next year though this probably had more to do with fixing next
year's pension increases to the expected rate of inflation than to what is
seriously achievable.
The government is being very cautious on how quickly it can draw down its
deficits. Mr Solchaga had planned a central government deficit (the social
security system included) of 3 per cent of GDP for 1993. Mr Solbes said it
would turn out closer to 6.2 per cent and his target for 1994 is 5.7 per
cent.
By last August the central deficit was Pta1,000bn higher than planned.
Conservative new targets will appeal to the CiU, who are also likely to be
attracted by an annex to the budget containing a slew of tax breaks designed
to help small businesses and stimulate industrial activity.
CiU support comes from small business and the party could anger its grass
roots if, in the end, it were not to come in behind Mr Gonzalez and give him
his budget.
That would leave only the unions on the outside. Government officials know
they cannot force private employers to moderate pay but warn that, in the
absence of a wages pact, they will punish overgenerous employers. Officials
do, however, say they have the power to implement a series of labour market
reforms which are to be negotiated along with the global wages deal from
next week. The more reluctant the unions are to commit themselves to pay
restraint, the tougher the labour market reforms will be.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Blunders hit Campbell election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of blunders by Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, has thrown
her Progressive Conservative party on the defensive in the campaign leading
up to the October 25 general election.
With less than a month to go, opinion polls show the Tories losing support
both to their main opposition, the Liberals, and to two regional parties,
the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, and the Reform party in western
Canada.
A Gallup poll published over the weekend gave the Liberals 37 per cent of
decided votes, compared with 30 per cent for the Tories.
But the Bloc Quebecois was backed by 38 per cent of voters in Quebec,
suggesting it could win as many as 40 seats in the 395-seat House of
Commons. The BQ's support has held firm, although the two big parties still
hope to convince Quebeckers that a vote for the Bloc is wasted because it
has no hope of forming a majority government, or of being included in a
minority one.
Numerous minority-government scenarios are increasingly being discussed in
political circles. Among the possibilities which have been raised is a
Liberal-Conservative alliance, designed mainly to blunt the BQ.
Ms Campbell has succeeded in distancing herself from her unpopular
predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. But her bursts of dogmatic candour have not
played well against the more reassuring, middle- of-the-road style of Mr
Jean Chretien, the veteran politician who leads the Liberals.
In particular, Ms Campbell has been hurt by her promise to eliminate the
CDollars 35bn (Pounds 17.3bn) federal budget deficit within five years,
without spelling out how this will be done.
She has adamantly refused so far to discuss the highly-charged subject of
social security reforms, which would be the key to any serious
deficit-cutting exercise.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Belgium to seek air passenger quotas
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM will today seek at a meeting of EC aviation ministers in Brussels
the re-introduction of passenger capacity quotas to help financially
strapped European airlines. The move will be firmly opposed by the UK.
The meeting has been called by Belgium, which currently holds the EC
presidency, and whose government has come under increasing pressure to
support Sabena, the financially troubled Belgian flag carrier.
Belgium is expected to present a paper at the meeting which raises the
possibility not only of re-introducing capacity-sharing arrangements between
airlines, but also floats the idea of EC funding for airlines in trouble. In
response, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, is expected to make
a strong plea against further government subsidies to support the EC's
state-owned flag carriers.
The UK is particularly concerned that the EC does not backtrack on its air
transport liberalisation policy because of the current difficulties faced by
the airline industry.
However, a number of other EC countries, led by France, consider the UK
position as 'hypocritical.
Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman of Air France, argued that UK carriers were
the 'most protected' in the world through the existing bilateral aviation
agreement between the UK and the US.
'Apostles of British liberalism carefully close the doors to London Heathrow
and continue to reap the easy profits of the Anglo-American air traffic
agreement, Bermuda 2, signed in 1977,' he said.
The agreement was tantamount to a state subsidy, he claimed.
The meeting of aviation ministers also coincides with a series of hearings
held this month by an EC group of 'wise men' set up to analyse and propose
cures for the European airline industry which lost Dollars 700m (Pounds
466m) last year.
Several EC countries and their national carriers have argued for the
re-introduction of some capacity controls scrapped under the EC airline
liberalisation package in the face of continuing over capacity in the
airline market.
At the same time, a number of state carriers, including Aer Lingus, Air
France, Sabena and Iberia, have been seeking additional cash injections from
their governments to support them during the current, prolonged industry
recession.
But the UK government and UK airlines argue that additional government
financial support would simply distort even more competition in the market
and that troubled airlines must launch restructuring programmes to make
themselves more efficient by sharply reducing their heavy level of unit
costs.

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament's struggle against its abolition by President Boris
Yeltsin appeared last night to be waning, after a weekend of cold, dark and
increasingly hungry isolation behind cordons of riot troops and police.
Mr Yeltsin and his government have kept up a momentum of decrees and orders
designed to bring rebels in the provinces into line, and to tackle economic
problems previously frozen by the gridlock between the presidential and
parliamentary powers.
The official Tass news agency reported last night that talks had begun
between the rebel parliament and representatives of the Interior Ministry
and the procurator's office on the handing over of the weapons still held by
guards and supporters in the parliament's 'White House'.
Tass said General Alexander Rutskoi, former vice president designated acting
president by the parliamentary deputies, agreed to the handover on condition
that the usual military protocols on handing over weapons were observed.
However, last night Gen Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliamentary
speaker, remained in the White House, which has had its light and heat shut
off, and both continued to express a determination to fight to the end. A
forage party of some 500 deputies and supporters left the building early in
the evening, saying they were 'looking for food' - amid some speculation
from the police who let them out on their intentions to return.
Early this morning armed guards patrolling the White House began
strengthening barricades amid rumours of an imminent attack. Mr Khasbulatov
said he had information that a raid was being prepared, although there was
no sign of this among government troops ringing the building.
Meanwhile, Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the constitutional court, is shuttling
between Gen Rutskoi and Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, a close Yeltsin aide, in an
attempt to get a compromise on which the siege could end. Mr Zorkin said he
had proposed a 'zero option' - of a return to the status quo before
parliament was abolished coupled with early and simultaneous presidential
and parliamentary elections - and claimed Gen Rutskoi 'is inclined to accept
one of these options'.
But the weekend saw a blaze of confidence by the president's side, the apex
of which was a concert yesterday, attended by Mr Yeltsin and his senior
aides, at which the emigre cellist Mr Mstislav Rostropovich conducted a
performance of the 1812 Overture in a packed Red Square. The cannons and
bells which are part of the overture - rejoicing at Napoleon's retreat from
Moscow - were provided by the Kremlin.
Mr Yeltsin admits the regional councils are evenly split on support for him.
Those few regional administrators who had 'reacted badly' would be fired -
Mr Yuri Lodkin, the governor of Bryansk region, already has been.
Mr Yeltsin has also adopted a decree holding all officials and serving
officers responsible for the carrying out of his decree on constitutional
reform, signed last Tuesday - though the decree also forbids the arrest of
those demonstrating against him.
The government has passed a decree stipulating that the central bank must
stop advancing low-interest credits, limiting its lending to loans at the
new, 180 per cent per annum interest rate - a rate which is even higher than
it appears, because the bank divides the annual rate by 12 to set a monthly
rate, then compounds up the monthly rate.
A constitutional assembly bringing together representatives of parties,
associations, enterprises and unions has started work on a draft
constitution and on an election law for a new federal assembly, which Mr
Yeltsin has decreed will be elected on December 12.
But sentiment is growing for simultaneous parliamentary and presidential
elections, instead of the six-month gap he has decreed between the federal
assembly elections and the June 12 presidential elections.
Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, said at the weekend the gap
was needed to give stability, especially important in a nuclear state.
However, simultaneous elections have centrist and liberal support from a
range of prominent figures including Mr Grigor Yavlinsky, the main declared
challenger for the presidency, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet
president, Mr Nikolai Fyodorov, the former Russian justice minister, and Mr
Nikolai Ryzhkov, the former Soviet prime minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin is planning to visit Tokyo in the middle of
next month, in spite of the continuing turmoil in Moscow, according to
Japanese government officials, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Mr Yeltsin
has cancelled Tokyo visits twice in the past year, but Japanese officials
say Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, indicated that the
president will visit Japan for a 'few days' from October 12.
Mr Kozyrev met Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, in New York, where
the two agreed that a Russian delegation should be sent to Japan to finalise
details of Mr Yeltsin's visit.
Japanese officials said Mr Yeltsin apparently wants to send a signal to
opponents that he is confident enough of his hold on power to make the trip.
The Russian president, they said, also did not want to damage relations with
Japan by cancelling again.
The previous cancellations arose from a territorial dispute between Japan
and Russia over the Kurile Islands at Japan's northern tip, occupied by
Soviet troops at the end of the second world war.
Japanese officials said Mr Kozyrev indicated that the Kurile dispute would
be discussed during the Russian president's visit.
The assurances by Mr Kozyrev about the visit next month have come as a
surprise to the Japanese government, which had begun to think that a
postponement was inevitable, given the conflict in Moscow over the past
week.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, last night rejected a plea by
his government to be evacuated by the Russians from the besieged city of
Sukhumi, a source close to the government said, agencies report from
Tbilisi.
His refusal came as Abkhazian soldiers tightened their grip on the regional
capital of the breakaway region of western Georgia, which has been cut off
from the rest of the country after separatists broke a seven-week-old
ceasefire 11 days ago.
Mr Shevardnadze's chief of staff, Mr Vazha Lortkipanidze, said although the
former Soviet foreign minister had been cut off by the Abkhazians he had not
yet been cornered.

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Germany's governing coalition to elect Mr Steffen Heitmann as
president were thrown into disarray at the weekend when the Free Democrats,
the junior coalition partner, implicitly rejected him as a candidate, writes
Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Without support by the FDP, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian
Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, its sister party in
Bavaria, could not gain a majority of votes in a special congress convened
next May to chose a successor to Mr Richard Von Weizsacker. The opposition
Social Democrats have already nominated Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and FDP leader, said in an interview at
the weekend that 'Heitmann is not our man.' Mr Heitmann is justice minister
of the eastern state of Saxony. The FDP, backed by many women deputies in
the Bundestag or Lower House, is increasingly swinging behind Ms Hildegard
Hamm-Brucher, the author and former secretary of state at the foreign
ministry. The party had earlier asked Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former
foreign minister, but he refused.
Although Ms Hamm-Brucher, 72, is not from eastern Germany, she is seen as
someone who would help the psychological integration of the two Germanies in
Europe.
The FDP's reluctance to support the government stems from Mr Heitmann's
views over Europe, in which he criticised the way in which the Maastricht
Treaty has been imposed on the member states of the EC. The party is also
deeply sceptical about his views on German unification.
Mr Kohl had chosen Mr Heitmann because he is from eastern Germany. But
officials in Saxony conceded it was a mistake. 'This is a token gesture for
the east Germans, who increasingly feel bitter about how they are being used
in this campaign,' a Saxon government official said.

<TEXT>
ESTONIA is seeking to strengthen its reputation as the best performing
former Soviet republic by reforming the banking system.
A commercial bank law, being drafted for presentation before parliament in
November, sets out higher capital requirements for new banks and stricter
regulation of the Baltic state's infant financial sector.
Initial capital requirements for a bank will go up to EKr25m (Dollars 1.9m)
by next July, after rising from EKr6m to EKr15m earlier this year. The
government hopes eventually to match the European norm of Ecu5m.
Meanwhile reserve requirements on deposits, deemed too high at 10 per cent,
will be decreased to free the banks' hands, according to Mr Andres Sutt,
deputy head of banking supervision at the Bank of Estonia. The maximum
exposure to one borrower is not being reduced from the current high level of
50 per cent of total capital.
The steps follow an initial restructuring begun after a banking crisis last
winter led to failures at three of the largest banks, which accounted for a
third of the money supply.
The national bank's regulatory arm reviewed licences and set higher
operating standards. Of the 42 commercial banks at the start of the year,
one has gone bankrupt, 10 have merged and eight were not given new licences.
To further strengthen the sector, the Bank of Estonia has decided not to
give new commercial licences this year.
The government wanted to close half the banks in order to centralise scarce
capital and temper the weak banks' penchant for risky lending, particularly
in Russia. The banks are now being asked to redirect themselves to financing
infrastructure work, recapitalisation at newly privatised state enterprises
and to consumer operations.
Tallinn Bank, one of the largest with EKr190m in total assets, plans to open
the country's first automated teller machine next month and computerise
capital transfers soon afterwards.
The banks are gaining confidence. Lending rates are between 20 to 30 per
cent a year, down from 100 per cent when Estonia began monetary reform by
introducing its currency, the kroon, in June 1992.
Estonia may have stemmed its economic decline. Local experts point to a
flourishing private sector, which now makes up 40 per cent of the economy,
and an export boom.
Exports rose by some 50 per cent the first half of the year, mostly driven
by trade with western countries, particularly Finland. The IMF expects
exports with countries other than former Soviet Union states to hit Dollars
500m (Pounds 333m) this year, up from Dollars 50m in 1991 to Dollars 247m in
1992.
'Nobody could be more pleased. Estonia really has changed in one year,' says
Mr Mart Laar, prime minister. He adds that he wants Estonia to be the first
former Soviet republic to permit foreign ownership of land.
Industrial output the first half of the year was 65.3 per cent of the 1992
level and real wages are not rising. But Estonia remains the darling of
international lending institutions for its monetary and fiscal discipline:
inflation was 0.7 per cent in August, the currency is stable and the budget
is projected to remain in broad balance next year.

FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Theorising on an eastern promise -
An attempt to explain east Asia's dynamic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank has proposed a new 'functional' theory of economic growth to explain
the unparalleled economic success of dyn-amic east Asia countries. The
problem in explaining the region's success is that it is not homogenous.
There is no single 'east Asian model': Hong Kong, for example, has followed
some of the most laissez faire policies of any country whereas the
governments of Japan and Korea intervened heavily to promote economic
development.
The new theory (see flow diagram) focuses more on what has to be done to
achieve rapid growth than on who should do what. Countries will do well as
long as they find a way of accumulating assets rapidly, allocating resources
efficiently, and achieving rapid productivity growth by catching up
technologically with advanced economies. All three functions are mutually
reinforcing.
But the theory does not assume that any of these growth functions must be
performed exclusively by the private sector: east Asian economies have used
various mixtures of market incentives and state interventions to achieve
each of these goals.
The bank study says much of east Asia's success reflected its strong
performance on economic fundamentals. Rapid accumulation of capital, for
example, reflected a share of investment in gross domestic product that was
7-10 percentage points higher than in other developing countries.
There was also a strong emphasis throughout the region on accumulating
'human capital' - increases in workforce skills brought about by investment
in education and training. East Asia did more to promote education,
especially at the primary, secondary and technical level, than any other
developing region.
But in keeping with the functional growth theory, the bank notes that east
Asian economies 'went beyond the fundamentals, intervening with varying
degrees of intensity to alter market incentives'. In other words, they
deliberately 'got some prices wrong'. The most successful interventions were
generous subsidies for manufactured exports, the bank says.
In a departure from orthodox economic theories, the functional growth theory
claims that government bureaucrats can sometimes allocate resources as
efficiently as private markets. In Japan and Korea, governments used
non-market 'economic contests' to allocate resources.
For example they would establish elaborate rules under which companies would
compete for a valuable asset controlled by the public sector, such as access
to credit or foreign exchange. The contest would be set up so that the
companies likely to make best use of the resource would win.
'Organising contests is a more complicated way to run an economy than
relying on laissez faire, just as organising party games is more complicated
than providing a level playing field and letting children do as they please.
Laissez faire and free play both work. But a well-run contest, like a
well-run party game, can generate even better results, by providing a focus
for competition and inducing participants to co-operate as they compete,'
the bank writes.
Many economists will recoil at the bank's suggestion that contests run by
bureaucrats can allocate resources as efficiently as free markets. They will
ask how government officials will obtain the information needed to judge
which companies or sectors deserve the rewards, such as subsidised credit.
The bank concedes that the success of contests as an allocative mechanism
depends heavily on the calibre and integrity of the bureaucrats. In most
developing countries rationing of resources by the public sector has failed.
The bank also says that some of the most ambitious interventions attempted
in east Asia, such as industrial policies designed to accelerate a shift
into high-tech sectors, mostly failed. With the possible exception of Japan,
unaided market forces would have brought about the changes sought by
government officials.
The report stresses the region's 'export push' strategy was one of the
principal reasons for its success. The focus on foreign markets promoted
economic efficiency by keeping domestic prices closely in line with
international prices and accelerated the introduction of foreign
technologies. This facilitated rapid increases in productivity.

Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, yesterday called for a further
strengthening of the Trinidad terms for giving debt relief to the poorest
developing countries, writes Peter Norman.
In a speech to the policy-making interim committee of the International
Monetary Fund, Mr Clarke said the waiting period during which countries
qualified for a reduction of their stock of official debt should be cut from
the present three to four years. He later suggested that 12 months might be
sufficient for countries with a good record of economic reform.
Mr Clarke also said the rate of debt reduction should be increased to two
thirds, from 50 per cent.

THE International Monetary Fund is preparing an Dollars 850m (Pounds 551.9m)
loan to South Africa under its compensatory and contingency financing
facility, writes Peter Norman.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said at the weekend the Fund was
already helping South Africa with policy advice. The CCFF loan, which is now
the subject of preliminary discussions, would offset export losses caused by
the drought in the region. He said the IMF was ready to provide further
financial support. However, it was up to the South African authorities to
decide how much they wished the Fund to be involved in economic
transformation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has voted to set up an inspection panel to review complaints
from board members or people affected by its loans, completing a series of
far-reaching reforms of its operating practices.
The three-member panel will investigate complaints by any party which
believes it has been adversely affected by the bank's failure to follow its
own rules and procedures.
The move follows an earlier decision by the bank to expand its policy on the
disclosure of information and a far-reaching reform of management practices
intended to shift its culture away from a concentration on lending and
towards effective implementation of the projects it lends for.
New inspection procedures have been a central demand of non-governmental
organisations which monitor the World Bank since the controversy last year
over the Narmada dam project in India.
The bank eventually set up an ad hoc inspection commission for Narmada, and
the Indian government withdrew its request for bank financing after a
critical report.
Environmentalists' demands have been echoed in the US Congress this year
during debate over the US contribution to the International Development
Association, the World Bank unit which lends money at low interest rates to
the poorest countries.
Mr Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman who heads the committee
dealing with the IDA legislation, has negotiated an authorisation for only
two of the US's three scheduled contributions of Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds
830m) each.
Mr Frank said there was still some uncertainty over how the reforms would
work in practice.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement of Tariffs
and Trade, damped hopes yesterday of any early solution to the critical
dispute between the European Community and the US which threatens world
trade reforms.
He said an attempt by the EC at French insistence to amend the Blair House
accord on agriculture, reached last November between the EC and the US, had
created 'an impasse to which a clear solution is not apparent'.
A crucial aspect of the accord envisages a 21 per cent cut in the volume of
subsidised EC food exports over the next six years.
Mr Sutherland, speaking after addressing the IMF interim committee in
Washington, warned the dispute was among issues that could wreck the Uruguay
Round of trade talks due to finish by December 15. He said he could not
foresee the deadline being extended.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, are to discuss the dispute in Washington today. It arose
after France called for further 'clarifications' to the accord.
Mr Sutherland's remarks came as the World Bank disclosed findings of a study
which concluded the partial trade liberalisation envisaged under the Uruguay
Round could add Dollars 213bn (Pounds 138.3bn) a year to world income by
2002.

FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Schlesinger firesparting shots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Schlesinger was in feisty mood when he met the press in Washington
at the weekend.
Making one of his last media appearances before stepping down as Bundesbank
president at the end of this week, he lashed out at critics of Bundesbank
policy, the European exchange rate mechanism, and particularly at the IMF's
latest World Economic Outlook.
The document was wrong to suggest that German unification had decisively
hindered global recovery by forcing high short-term interest rates on other
countries, he said.
German union had not prevented countries with floating currencies such as
the US from cutting their interest rates. It was the European exchange rate
mechanism that was at fault.
He gave short shrift to suggestions that German interest rates were too
high. Capital market rates had fallen to their lowest levels in many years.
But he reserved special scorn for the unknown author of the IMF outlook who
had omitted to include any reference to money supply in its 200 pages. This,
he said, was an extraordinary philosophical lapse for a monetary body such
as the IMF.

Mr Ivan Szabo, Hungary's finance minister, is the first representative of a

'It is a warning signal. I think this should warn the whole world,' Mr Szabo
said of the Polish election results, in which a grouping of former
communists emerged as the largest party in parliament.
'Unless the countries of our region are allowed to integrate further into
the world economy things could get worse. It is impossible not to notice the

FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Russia hopes to stabilise budget
soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has told the Group of Seven leading industrial nations that it hopes
to stabilise its budget position this year so it can qualify for more
financial aid from the IMF.
At a meeting on Saturday with G7 finance ministers and central bank
governors, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, described
Russian plans to cut subsidies on grain and bread production, change taxes
and remove indexation with the aim of cutting the budget deficit and
inflation by late this year.
At that time the IMF might be able to release a second Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1bn) loan to Russia under its systemic transformation facility to help
Russia's difficult move towards a market economy, G7 officials said.
At the end of Saturday's meeting, the finance ministers from the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada 'expressed their very strong
hope' that the political developments of the past week 'will help Russia
achieve a decisive breakthrough on the path of market reform'.
The ministers praised President Boris Yeltsin's commitment to pursue the
path of market-oriented reform, which they saw as right for creating a
better future for the Russian people and integrating Russia into the world
economy.
But before meeting Mr Fyodorov, the G7 ministers decided among themselves
that new financial support should not be given to Russia before it had
brought its economic reform programme back on the track laid down by the IMF
during the summer.
'There was a general sense among G7 officials that the provision of
stabilisation support has to be measured with the progress of reform,' a US
Treasury official said.
'It must be help for self-help,' declared Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, who said Mr Fyodorov had made no request for an easing of the
economic policy conditions on which the IMF support has been based.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOBS rather than growth is becoming the main priority of the world's leading
industrial nations. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, yesterday summed
up the new mood. 'The persistence of high levels of structural unemployment
right across the continent of Europe is, in my opinion, the most serious
economic problem facing our governments today,' he said.
Addressing the International Monetary Fund's policy making interim
committee, Mr Clarke said that: 'In Europe, there is no longer a belief that
the resumption of growth is the sole remedy for all economic ills'. He was
'extremely concerned that there is no guarantee that unemployment will fall
significantly as the recovery progresses.'
Mr Clarke was taking up an issue he broached at the Group of Seven world
economic summit in Tokyo in July and which was actively debated in the
interim committee yesterday and at Saturday's meeting of G7 finance
ministers and central bank governors in Washington.
In a communique last night the interim committee expressed concern about the
continued weak growth in industrial countries and high and rising rates of
unemployment and persistent protectionist pressures.
It underlined the importance of a speedy conclusion to the Uruguay Round of
trade talks for job creation. In addition it urged price stability and
deficit reduction to provide scope for lower interest rates.
The ministers, representing the IMF membership, also said structural reforms
would have to be given greater emphasis in the industrial countries.
They singled out labour market flexibility, social security and healthcare
reform and deregulation as important for longer term growth.
'Our work is not over,' said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary,
yesterday. 'We still have a way to go to achieve the kind of strong, job
creating growth that will put back to work the 34m men and women who are
unemployed in the OECD countries alone.'
The issue will be taken further at a special G7 jobs conference being
organised by the Clinton administration which is likely to take place later
this autumn.
Yesterday Mr Clarke stressed the importance of flexible labour markets for
job creation.
'European labour markets are paralysed by the burden of restrictive
practices, social security systems which encourage dependency and well
meaning but counter productive social legislation which reduces job creation
by piling costs on to employers,' he said.
Mr Bentsen said that every industrial nation must do its part to ensure
strong recovery.
The US must cut its budget deficit more. Healthcare reform was the top
priority in the US.
Japan should speed deregulation and craft its tax reform to provide a net
stimulus to the economy.
Europe should use 'all available room' to cut interest rates further and
reduce budget deficits.
Some ministers took comfort from greater optimism among the German
delegation that their country was past the worst of the recession.
Speaking after the G7 meeting, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, hinted that the central bank might have more scope to lower
interest rates.

FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: IMF prepares Dollars 850m S Africa
loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is preparing a Dollars 850m (Pounds 551.9m)
loan to South Africa under its compensatory and contingency financing
facility.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said at the weekend the Fund was
already helping South Africa with policy advice. The CCFF loan, which is now
the subject of preliminary discussions, would offset export losses caused by
the drought in the region.
He said the IMF was ready to provide further financial support. However, it
was up to the South African authorities to decide how much they wished the
Fund to be involved in economic transformation.
Mr Camdessus met Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress,
for private talks in Washington on Saturday.
Although the South Africa issue was not on the agenda of the weekend meeting
of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, it was raised in
bilateral talks between some of the ministers. Mr Theo Waigel, German
finance minister, said he discussed the country in a meeting with Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, US Treasury secretary.

FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Russia hopes to stabilise budget
soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has told the Group of Seven leading industrial nations that it hopes
to stabilise its budget position this year so that it can qualify for
further financial assistance from the IMF.
At a meeting on Saturday with G7 finance ministers and central bank
governors, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, described
Russian plans to cut subsidies on grain and bread production, change taxes
and remove indexation with the aim of cutting the budget deficit and
inflation by late this year.
At that time the IMF might be able to release a second Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1bn) loan to Russia under its systemic transformation facility to help
Russia's difficult move towards a market economy, G7 officials said.
At the end of Saturday's meeting, the finance ministers from the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada 'expressed their very strong
hope' that the political developments of the past week 'will help Russia
achieve a decisive breakthrough on the path of market reform'.
The ministers praised President Boris Yeltsin's commitment to pursue the
path of market-oriented reform, which they saw as right for creating a
better future for the Russian people and integrating Russia into the world
economy.
But before meeting Mr Fyodorov, the G7 ministers decided among themselves
that new financial support should not be given to Russia before it had
brought its economic reform programme back on the track laid down by the IMF
during the summer.
'There was a general sense among G7 officials that the provision of
stabilisation support has to be measured with the progress of reform,' a
senior US Treasury official said.
'It must be help for self help,' declared Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, who said that Mr Fyodorov had made no request for an easing of the
economic policy conditions on which the IMF support has been based. Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, said: 'I do not think the people
responsible for economic reform would welcome any relaxation of the
conditions.'
According to Mr Waigel, Mr Fyodorov told the G7 ministers that the Russian
people were not really worried by the political crisis.
There was a danger, however, that efforts to limit the state budget would be
undermined during the forthcoming parliamentary election campaign.
Because of the political uncertainty, Mr Fyodorov had given no precise date
for when Russia's reform programme would be back on track.

FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Japan expects to boost economy with
tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government expects to implement a tax reform package, including
an income tax cut, which will stimulate the economy in the medium term, the
G7 meeting was told by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japanese finance minister.
Mr Fujii said after the meeting that Japan believed the recent cut in its
discount rate, together with measures to raise public investment and the
planned tax reforms, would be enough to raise demand in the economy.
His comments on tax reforms, which are being studied by a panel at the
request of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, follow calls from
business leaders for a prompt cut in income tax to stimulate demand.
Mr Fujii said tax reform could have a deflationary effect in the short term
because a rise in consumption taxes would outweigh the stimulative effect of
an income tax cut, but in the medium term it would be beneficial.
The presentation of the new Japanese government's economic reform proposals
was welcomed by other G7 members, despite earlier indications that they
wanted further measures to increase economic demand.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary who chaired the meeting, said the G7
partners 'looked forward to far-reaching deregulation of the economy, and
tax reform too'. This was 'obviously under serious consideration'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said 'anything the Japanese government can
do to stimulate demand is welcome to Japan's trade partners'. However, it
was for the Japanese government to determine the right measures.
Mr Fujii emphasised there had been 'no critical comments' about Japan. He
said the rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar had damaged the
economy, and precipitous exchange rate fluctuations were to be avoided.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Councils seek room to settle fire pay dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITY employers will tomorrow press the government to give them
sufficient financial flexibility to prevent the first national strike in the
fire service for 15 years.
The local authorities will press their case at a meeting with Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary, following Saturday's three-to-one vote by the
Fire Brigade Union's delegate conference to hold a strike ballot.
The employers - predominantly Labour and Liberal Democratic county and
metropolitan councils - have made no secret of their strong sympathy for the
firefighters, who are opposed to the suspension for this year of their
15-year-old pay formula, which links firefighters' pay increases to the rise
in the upper 25 per cent of male earnings.
The employers have already promised the firefighters a return to the pay
formula in 1994 despite a second year of tough government-imposed wage
restraint.
They will be seeking assurances from Mr Howard that he is willing to provide
the financial flexibility needed to meet that commitment without forcing
cuts in the fire service. Some FBU leaders have said that a guarantee to
reinstate the formula would head off the risk of a strike.
The earnings figure which determines firefighters' pay will be known on
Thursday when the Department of Employment publishes Britain's annual
earnings survey.
If the figure turns out to be close to the government's 1.5 per cent public
sector pay limit, then the employers are expected to meet the firefighters'
award in full. The award would be staged, with 1.5 per cent paid this
November and the rest coming next spring.
A senior local authority employer said yesterday: 'There is a slim chance
that the firefighters' dispute can be avoided.'
Fire Brigade union leaders are due to resume negotiations with the employers
on Friday. But Mr Ken Cameron, the union's general secretary, said yesterday
there would be no point in meeting if the employers 'had nothing new to put
on the table'.
On Saturday, the union's delegates voted by 31,825 to 11,004 to hold a
strike ballot which is due to start next Monday. If the ballot goes ahead,
the result will be known by November 1 and stoppages could begin after
November 8.

FT  27 SEP 93 / New Ulster constitution planned: Anglo-Irish working party
to draft an outline settlement for Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH and Irish governments are seeking to draft a new constitutional
settlement for Northern Ireland in a last-ditch attempt to revive stalled
talks on the political future of the province.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the
Irish foreign minister, have asked a joint working party of civil servants
to present the draft by the end of October.
Their decision, agreed privately at this month's meeting of the Anglo-Irish
conference, reflects the growing view in London that the two governments
have only a narrow window of opportunity to restart the political process.
But there was uncertainty last night over whether the weekend initiative by
Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein,
would hinder the process. The initiative was greeted by some in Ireland as
offering the best prospects for peace in more than 20 years.
The SDLP and Sinn Fein, in a joint report to be delivered to the US and
Irish governments, have proposed appointing a US mediator to break the
political impasse in Northern Ireland.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given an outline of the proposals by
Mr Hume two weeks ago in London.
Mr Hume made it clear he wanted to break out of the present framework for
negotiations. But Sir Patrick insists there can be no negotiations with Sinn
Fein until it unequivocally renounces violence.
At the heart of the settlement under discussion between London and Dublin
would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to
jurisdiction over Ulster with an 'aspiration' to achieve a united Ireland.
London would acknowledge in return that if ever a majority in the province
favoured re-unification then it would respect that view and pass the
necessary legislation. It would also agree to a significant extension of
cross-border co-operation involving the creation of joint executive boards
in such areas as transport, tourism and relations with the European
Community.
The aim of the draft is to create an 'umbrella' under which the Protestant
and Catholic political parties in the province could be persuaded to resume
the round-table talks on internal political arrangements which broke down
last year.
In parallel, Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible
for political affairs, is engaged in an intensive round of contacts with the
Unionists and with the mainly Catholic SDLP.
Sir Patrick is said to be 'hopeful' rather than optimistic that the approach
will succeed. He has been encouraged, however, by a number of recent
developments, including the decision by Mr Ian Paisley, the leader of the
Democratic Unionists, to table his own proposals for a political settlement.
There is a growing feeling in London that Mr Paisley fears he could be
outflanked by the official Ulster Unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux.
There is a growing view among many senior ministers that the next few months
could offer the last chance of a settlement during the lifetime of the
present parliament. By January the parties in the province will be launching
their campaigns for the local and European elections.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been involved in bilateral talks since last April.
In a weekend statement they said: 'We are convinced from our discussions
that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people
of this island, which will provide a solid basis for peace. Such a process
would obviously also be designed to ensure that any new agreement that might
emerge respects the diversity of our different traditions and earns their
allegiance and agreement'.
A spokesman for the SDLP said the joint proposals meant Sinn Fein was
effectively a partner in the negotiations. Unionist leaders last night urged
the British government to reject Sinn Fein's claims to be a party in the
talks.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Pools pioneer Sir John Moores dies at 97
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN MOORES, the football pools inventor who turned the Littlewoods
retail, mail order, pools and catalogue stores business into one of the
largest privately-owned companies in Europe, died yesterday at his Formby,
Merseyside, home at the age of 97.
He had been in poor health since being assaulted by burglars at his home
four years ago.
His death puts in question the future of both Littlewoods and Everton
Football Club, the premier league club which is owned by his family
interests.
Littlewoods, the UK's fifth largest clothes retailer and second largest mail
order group, could be worth about Pounds 2bn if it were floated in the stock
market. It is owned by 32 family shareholders across several generations.
The family split three years ago over a plan to take Littlewoods public. Sir
John marshalled opposition to the move. The pressure to float or break up
the group is now likely to increase.
Littlewoods' latest results showed unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 97m
for 1992, on turnover up from Pounds 2.59bn to Pounds 2.71bn.
Its retail interests consist of 126 chain stores across the UK, which
account for about 1.9 per cent of the UK clothing market, according to
Verdict, the retail market research group. The stores made a profit of
Pounds 28m from sales of Pounds 696m last year.
It also owns the UK's second-biggest mail order company, which controls
nearly a quarter of the market. Littlewoods came close to selling this
business to Quelle, the German mail order operator, in 1991, but
negotiations broke down after failure to agree on a price. Sales were Pounds
974m, with profits of Pounds 55.9m.
Littlewoods, although a private business, has been open to new ideas. It has
two stores in St Petersburg, Russia, and earlier this year joined with Price
Club Canada in a plan to open one of the UK's first warehouse clubs.

FT  27 SEP 93 / Smith wins support in fight over party voting reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, DAVID GOODHART and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH was thrown a lifeline by his trade union allies last night as
his battle to extend Labour's internal democracy turned its Brighton
conference into a power struggle between the party's modernisers and
traditionalists.
After a day of horsetrading in seafront hotels, the public service union
Nupe said it would support Labour's plan to replace union participation in
the selection of parliamentary candidates with a 'one-member-one-vote'
system.
Three other unions - Cohse, representing health workers, UCW, the postal
union, and Usdaw, representing shopworkers - also switched their support to
the Labour leader. Usdaw's backing was by a margin of only two votes in the
delegation meeting.
Mr Smith, who has staked his political authority on the proposal, said the
tide was now running in his favour, and senior party officials privately
predicted a comfortable victory in Wednesday's crucial conference vote.
But in a public display of acrimony reminiscent of Labour conferences in the
mid-1980s, the leaders of the GMB and TGWU general unions denounced Mr
Smith's plan as an attempt to exclude trade unions from Labour's
decision-making.
The final outcome on Wednesday may now depend on the extent of support for
Mr Smith from many, as yet undecided, constituency delegates.
The skirmishes on the eve of the conference's formal opening later today
also revealed sharp differences running well beyond what for most outside
the party represents an arcane internal dispute.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary and a leading party moderniser,
launched a scathing attack on those in the party opposing change.
In an interview in the Financial Times, Mr Blair described as 'eccentric'
and 'deluded' the traditionalists who blamed the party's election defeats on
a failure to be sufficiently bold. He declared that Labour had to face up to
the fact that 'old-style collectivism has had its day'.
But in a change of tone and emphasis, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, appeared to concede some ground to the trade unions leaders and
leftwing MPs demanding a more expansionist economic strategy.
Mr Brown derided a suggestion by Mr John Edmunds, the GMB leader, that the
party should commit itself to a Pounds 10bn increase in public borrowing. He
also refused to spell out any specific proposals for increases in income
tax.
But pledging to reverse the widening of the gap between rich and poor which
had taken place during the 1980s, he insisted that redistribution of wealth
was a central issue in terms of social justice and economic efficiency.
'If you're too poor to pay income tax, you shouldn't have to do so,' he
said, 'but if you have the money, the progressive principle will apply'.
That failed to reassure Mr Bryan Gould, the leading left-wing critic of the
leadership, who accused the party of being effectively 'brain-dead' on
economic policy.

FT  25 SEP 93 / As They Say in Europe: Between the Maginot lines - James
Morgan takes the measure of Franco-German friendship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCO-German relations have been at heart of much of the news this week
because of the GATT imbroglio. The alliance is central to almost everything
but to see what it really means I took a look at Le Monde and the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the continent's two most influential papers,
to see what France and Germany really mean to each other. How much space do
they devote to the other's news and what do they say?
As a balancing item there was a similar test of the importance of British
items in their output. So I took a period covering 17 issues of each
newspaper (do not ask why 17) from the end of August until the middle of
September. That period was unusually dull in all three countries and thus
made for a fair comparison: anti-Gatt demos were the most newsworthy events
to come out of France, the results of the Bundesbank interest rate cut from
Germany.
In that period, the Frankfurter Allgemeine devoted 366 column centimetres to
France. I was not wholly surprised, for reasons I shall explain later, to
find that Britain received 541cms, nearly 50 per cent more, in spite of
providing even less news.
Le Monde in that same period gave Germany 522cms, much of it Gatt-oriented,
while Britain received 432. There was a difficulty here because I excluded
from the count of Le Monde's cross-Channel coverage a huge tourism feature
on Herm in the Channel Islands - 'L'Eden 'made in Britain'.' Had that been
included the British score in Le Monde would have reached some 600cms.
What the papers write about indicated a lot. Apart from Gatt and German
interest rates, the French also follow neo-Nazi matters and the general
course of German domestic politics. The FAZ devoted nearly half its coverage
of France to Gatt-related topics ('It is scandalous that a single, small
interest group in a single country, France, can block a successful outcome
to this vital and significant trade round.') The rest was domestic politics
and some cultural events.
The structure of British news in the two papers was wholly different. In
both it is heavily oriented to personalities and traditional institutions.
Le Monde was interested in the Edinburgh festival, the former Chancellor
Norman Lamont, the novelist A S Byatt, the Trade Union Congress annual
conference and mad cow disease. The Germans took the death of the historian
E P Thompson very seriously and devoted much space to the BBC, the royal
family, the Oxford English dictionary and Harold Pinter's new play.
This research confirms me in an impression I have held since I began writing
this column. Franco-German friendship is a complete farce and both find the
British more interesting than they find each other. Significantly the
biggest single item about France in the FAZ during the relevant period was a
feature under the sub-heading, 'Is Franco-German friendship at an end?' It
was based on a study of a series of books or articles (mainly French) on
this very matter. The answer to the question seems to be 'Yes.'
A central element in the discussion was an interview the publisher of Der
Spiegel, Rudolf Augstein, gave to Le Figaro in August. Some recent
commentaries from Augstein had led him to be portrayed across the Rhine as a
'cynical French-hater.' But he told his interviewer, 'We don't accuse you,
the French, of the worst things. The worst was done by us. But you have to
realise: Even before Hitler there was a hostility between French and German
nationalism . . . The opposition to any form of German unity is a component
of your history, from Richelieu, to de Gaulle and Mitterand. As Clemenceau
significantly put it, 'There've always been too many Germans on this
earth.''
The account of Augstein's remarks ended with an attack on the 'Paris
intellectuals' and the 'intellectual arrogance of French chauvinism' which
were 'among the most unloved (French) export products.'
The frankness with which the Germans express themselves about the French has
no mirror image. French commentators are so aware of their national
dependence on Germany that they tread very carefully. As de Gaulle noted,
'The Germans are with us every minute of every day.'
But fortunately I have developed a research tool that gives an infallible
guide to underlying French attitudes. Try it yourself on the next Frenchman
you meet. You will find the response takes the following form - a sudden
intake of breath, a strange pallor suffuses the face, there's some choking,
a hand clutches the brow and finally a roar struggles from the confusion.
Just say: 'Last summer I was in Nice, walking along the Promenade des
Anglais, and I wondered why there wasn't a Promenade des Allemands.'

TOKYO rebounded as it returned to work after Thursday's holiday, but stocks
finished off their highs in subdued conditions on the last trading day for
September delivery, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The 225-share Nikkei average ended 132.91 higher at 20,307.53, a 0.4 per
cent fall on the week. The index started at its low of 20,225.82 and rose to
an intraday high of 20,324.63 shortly before midday.
Volume was around 300m shares, down from 310.66m on Wednesday. Advances
outnumbered declines by 571 to 464, with 152 issues unchanged.
The Topix index finished 3.24 higher at 1,631.36, while in London, the
ISE/Nikkei index rose 0.34 to 1,254.77.
The market opened higher on index-linked buying by investment trusts and on
weakening concerns about the political situation in Russia.
Index-linked arbitrage buying was triggered by firmness in Nikkei futures
following an overnight rise in Chicago.
Pharmaceuticals ended higher on expectations that new products would be
launched at forthcoming annual seminars on medicines. Kissei Pharmaceutical
rose Y150 to Y6,080, Ono Pharmaceuticals Y140 to Y6,010, and Sankyo Y50 to
Y2,940. Many pharmaceuticals manufacturers are also expecting good interim
and full-year profits in spite of the economic slump.
Expectations of government deregulation and income-tax cuts pushed up the
retailers. Seven-Eleven Japan was Y150 higher at Y8,650, Aoyama Trading
advanced Y150 to Y8,200 and Aoki International ended Y120 higher at Y5,380.
Roundup
SYDNEY's success in being awarded the 2000 Olympic Games moved both
Australian, and Hong Kong stocks.
AUSTRALIA's property development and construction stocks led the All
Ordinaries index higher. It hit a high of 1,960.2 in early trade, but
drifted off to end 17.9 up at 1,946.5, 1.1 per cent higher on the week, as
turnover more than doubled from ADollars 345.2m to ADollars 794.2m.
The contractor, Leighton Holdings, ended 23 cents or 11 per cent higher at
ADollars 2.32 after a high of ADollars 2.55 and Lend Lease, the big property
group, surged 56 cents to ADollars 17.26, off a high of ADollars 17.55. The
hotels group, AAPC, rose 3 cents to ADollars 75, and Sydney Aquarium by 5
cents to ADollars 1.70.
HONG KONG offered a mirror image, the Hang Seng index closing just 55.95
lower at 7,525.05, 1.4 per cent better on the week, after plunging over 150
points to a low of 7,422.65 early in the day. Turnover slipped from
HKDollars 3.44bn to HKDollars 3.08bn.
Recently strong China-related stocks led the losers, with consumer related
issues especially hard hit. Tsingtao Brewery dropped 35 cents to HKDollars
5.75 while China Travel lost 20 cents to HKDollars 2.20.
SINGAPORE fell back on selected selling of stocks by foreign institutions.
The Straits Times Industrial index closed down 11.78 at 1,983.25, a week's
fall of 1.25 per cent.
CarnaudMetalbox Asia continued to decline after its weak interim results on
Wednesday, shedding 60 cents to SDollars 7.90, in spite of announcing a new
can-making venture in China.
KUALA LUMPUR rose in brisk trading with the composite index adding 7.54 to
837.87, a week's gain of 2 per cent.
MANILA added to Thursday's rise helped by strong performances from
Philippine Long Distance Telephone and San Miguel. The composite index
gained 15.32 to 1,953.52, down 2 per cent on the week. PLDT climbed 10 pesos
to 1,350 pesos and San Miguel 5 pesos to 155 pesos. Turnover was 533.6m
pesos.
BOMBAY weakened on reports that carry forward costs may be raised. The BSE
index fell 36.38 to 2,722.77, for a week's decline of 1.5 per cent.
NEW ZEALAND's initial rise faded later leaving the NZSE-40 capital index
4.66 higher at 1,932.17.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Presidential contender flies home to Lagos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for the leadership of Nigeria was set to resume yesterday as
Chief Moshood Abiola flew back to Lagos to a hero's welcome to press for
recognition of his victory in the country's annulled presidential poll of
June 12.
News agencies reported that he was met at Lagos airport off a flight from
Paris by a huge crowd of supporters who defied security arrangements aimed
at limiting the size of the reception.
Thousands of people, many dressed in the green and white colours of his
Social Democractic Party, lined the roads from the airport and cheered the
waving Chief Abiola as he was driven the two miles (three km) to his Ikeja
home.
He made no public statement at the airport but his return is likely to boost
the tempo of the crusade to have him sworn in as president.
'All we are saying is give MKO a chance,' his supporters sang to the tune of
the popular John Lennon song, refering to Chief Abiola by his popular
nickname.
'MKO is our man]' the crowds chanted, waving placards saying 'We want MKO
for president.'
In a statement marking the end of a self-imposed six week exile and released
in advance of his departure yesterday morning, Mr Abiola called for a
'peaceful' response to his return.
'Nothing should be done to wipe off the positive achievement,' of the June
elections, said the statement.
In spite of the warm welcome in Lagos, the heart of Mr Abiola's political
stronghold, many of his supporters fear he has missed the boat. A general
strike failed to shift the new military-led government which succeeded
General Ibrahim Babangida from its plans to hold fresh elections next March.
Many of Mr Abiola's supporters have also been disappointed by his extended
absence, which began when he fled Lagos in his private jet, fearing for his
life. He nevertheless has the capacity to revive protest in the south, where
his support is considerable.
Mr Abiola's tactics, however, will depend on the outcome of recent exchanges
between him and the interim government led by Chief Ernest Shonekan.
In a statement sent to the Financial Times shortly before his departure, Mr
Abiola said that he had delayed his return in response to a request by Mr
Shonekan, relayed by the British foreign office.
Mr Shonekan had been expected to come to London for discussions 'and return
with me to Nigeria', said Mr Abiola. 'Unfortunately this promise remains
unfulfilled, and the suspicion now seems justified that the delay is
designed to keep me out of Nigeria.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Consumer spending in France declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH CONSUMER spending fell sharply last month, undermining hopes of a
rebound in household demand, according to statistics released yesterday by
INSEE, the national statistics office, writes John Ridding in Paris.
The INSEE figures, which showed a 2.8 per cent fall in household spending on
consumer goods in August, were compounded by a survey of business leaders.
The survey, also by INSEE, showed that despite expectations of a slight rise
in industrial output in September, consumer demand was expected to remain
depressed.
French government officials and private sector economists believe a revival
in demand, particularly in consumer spending, is the most important
condition for a recovery in the economy, forecast to contract by almost one
per cent this year in terms of GDP.
Consumer spending recovered slightly in the second quarter, rising by 0.4
per cent. But the impact of higher taxes on income, petrol and alcohol which
took effect in July, appears to have prompted renewed weakness in
expenditure last month. The fall in consumption in August included a fall of
7.8 per cent in durable goods. New car sales fell by 15.3 per cent in
August, compared with July.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Private View: Fairytales that frightened Tinseltown -
Armistead Maupin's novels about life in San Francisco were a huge success,
but no US producer dared film them. He explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a young mother in the bookshop, pushing a baby-buggy. 'I've read
all six of them,' she said. 'Twice.' She wiped the baby's nose. 'And I'm
going to start them again.'
She is one of the million readers of Armistead Maupin, the genial chronicler
of bohemian San Francisco whose first volume, Tales of the City, will be
serialised on British television from next week.
And here is the paradox: no American media mogul dared to make or even
co-finance a TV adaptation of the stories, even though they were written in
the mid-1970s for a family newspaper. What viewers will see, therefore, is a
British production, with American actors, of Maupin's gentle perversion of
the American Dream.
Why? Because, says the author, Hollywood is incapable of portraying sex or
drugs or homosexuals except in the most lurid way. 'The studios tried to
cannibalise my exotic storylines but not remain faithful to the spirit of
the books.' One executive wanted the homosexual characters 'reduced to campy
walk-ons'. Another suggested that the gay gynaecologist should be translated
into a serial killer.
Hollywood, Maupin said, lives in fear of 'narrow-minded fundamentalists who
don't want to see homosexuals depicted as average human beings', yet his own
postbag showed that the housewives of Iowa - or indeed suburban London - are
a lot more sophisticated.
He is probably right. But as a spokesman for gay rights, he is being perhaps
a little disingenuous. The culture of American television - unlike that of
Britain - has always been primarily commercial. A sympathetic screen
treatment of Maupin's fairytale, precisely because it is oh-so-innocent,
easily invites the commercially damaging charge of condoning vice.
Maupin's message is 'Be Yourself' and his methods are observation, wit and
the sparest, neatest prose. What Damon Runyon did for the New York
underworld he has done for the West Coast sub-culture.
You accuse Hollywood of distorting real life, I said, but the same could be
said of Tales of the City - that it is a sterilised account.
'I don't think I have sanitised any aspect of gay life to the degree that
it's unrecognisable,' he replied. 'I think the real threat of the book is
that it's an affectionate look at all sorts of sexualities.'
What about the bath houses, the sado-masochism, the gross promiscuity behind
your cheerful picture?
'I have characters who go to the bath houses, yes, and I myself went to the
bath houses. I did not see them as a dark and frightening. It's very hard to
say that today and have anyone understand it. But I saw them as places of
great joy and camaraderie. I wasn't into any kind of heavy S and M scene. I
was able to be matter of fact because I knew that a lot of very average and
nice people went there. They were like men's clubs, with sex.'
He agreed that Tales of the City, written before the Aids earthquake, might
look quaint today. (Later books in the sequence confront the epidemic). I
asked: aren't you concerned that it is so out-of-date?
'No, I'm very happy that I recorded a moment in history that was a very true
and pure time, and I'm happy to go on record as saying that I'm ashamed of
nothing that I did at that time and very grateful that I landed in San
Francisco when I did. Because it turned my life around.'
I said I was hoping to interview Maupin the writer, not just Maupin the
homosexual. He said he was grateful. 'I'm bored of discussing it as if I'm
some sort of ape in a zoo. Sometimes I just want to say: 'Get over it. There
are homosexuals in the world. It's not that sensational a subject after all,
is it?'.'
But it proved difficult to get over it. In a sense the subject made the
writer; it is the refrain that sustains his big theme, that Being Different
Is Normal. Even the midget actress who is the heroine of his latest novel,
Maybe the Moon, can be construed allegorically as a proxy victim of
'homophobia'.
Being homosexual was, Maupin said, 'the luckiest thing that happened to me.
It gave me material that had not been tapped and it forced me to re-examine
the rules of my life. In doing so I liberated myself, not only sexually, but
in terms of taking control of my own destiny.'
The eldest of three children, he had been taught from the age of eight to
aspire to his father's law practice in Raleigh, North Carolina. The family
was descended from Huguenots, belonged to the white aristocracy and boasted
a Confederate general among its forebears. His English grandmother seems to
have understood him: she told him the best figure he could cut in the world
was as himself. He commemorates her tolerance in the character of Anna
Madrigal, the landlady of Barbary Lane around whom his plot is spun.
Armistead Jones Maupin Jnr. went to the naval officers candidate school in
Charleston, South Carolina, after leaving university. To fill in time, he
worked for the local TV station, then managed by the arch-conservative
Senator Jesse Helms. In Charleston, aged 25, he first went to bed with a
man.
After a Mediterranean posting he volunteered for Vietnam. 'In some twisted
way I was trying to prove my manhood and the quickest way I could think of
was to go to war.'
Proving it to whom?
'My father. His attitude was that the world thoughtfully provides a war for
every generation, and Vietnam was my war.' He was appointed naval liaison
officer at an army base. 'I didn't kill anyone. I wasn't in direct combat
but there was fighting all around. It wasn't a gruelling, traumatic
experience. It was mostly living in a small village and being the
communications officer.'
Did it make a man of you? The irony was only half intended.
He laughed. 'No, I'm glad to say. It made a more interesting man of me. I
enjoyed the experience of seeing that part of the world and other Americans
not of my class. I was a good officer. I was decorated: the Navy
Commendation Medal. Nothing heroic, just a pat on the back for a job well
done.'
Afterwards he returned to Vietnam as a volunteer to build houses for war
veterans in the village of Cat Lai. Back in Charleston, Maupin felt stifled.
He headed to San Francisco as a reporter for the Associated Press. He was,
he said, 'a lousy reporter. I was always tinkering with the facts in an
effort to make the story better.'
He lost the job, worked as a letter-writer for an Episcopal minister, sold
silk in a shop on Union Street, and freelanced. Then he persuaded the San
Francisco Chronicle to employ him to write fiction.
'I trimmed the fat off my prose very fast, and learned the techniques of
suspense. I was forced to write 800 words a day; I told myself, it's going
to be on the bottom of someone's birdcage tomorrow so this doesn't have to
be Balzac.'
A life of gay abandon ended when Aids struck San Francisco. In any case,
Maupin was settling down. 'My grandmother said don't you dare get married
until you are 30.'
What age did you get married?
'Far too late. Forty'.
That was nine years ago. The man he settled down with, Terry Anderson, was
HIV-positive and last year suffered his first opportunistic infection, the
sign of full-blown Aids.
I asked if life was black. 'No. Even knowing that Terry has Aids we still
agree that it's the happiest time of our lives because we're very much in
love with each other, and we feel more that way every day.'
He will die, I said. What will that do to you?
'It'll be hard. As much as I empathise and feel for his situation I
sometimes remind myself he'll have me but I won't always have him.' Partly
in anticipation of this impending personal calamity Maupin's next novel will
be much more autobiographical.
I asked if his purpose was to 'normalise' homosexuality
'No, it's broader than that. My work is about finding the core of common
humanity in all of us. And I love to push to the limits. I love to take the
most extreme examples of humankind and show them to be every bit as real as
the reader.'
But is normalisation at the bottom of it?
'I suppose, yes. Call it 'humanisation'. I feel perfectly normal. It's all
about self realisation. It has to do with finding out exactly who you are
and presenting that person to the world as honestly and joyfully as you can.
And I think I am a marvellous example of how well that can pay off for you.'
So the message is 'Come out in Charleston', is it?
'Coming out in Charleston is the message. I didn't do it in Charleston. I
had to move to San Francisco to do it.
'But you can't just stay in San Francisco. Terry and I have to walk down the
street in every city in the world and then we have to be certain about who
we are. No matter where you go, there's always going to be someone asking
about your wife and kiddies, and you're going to have to decide whether or
not to lie about yourself.
'I don't think this just applies to gay people. A lot of straight people
make themselves miserable by keeping secrets that eventually poison them.
Secrets invariably imply a kind of shame about oneself, and that shame can
destroy you.
'You really are only as sick as you are secret - and that applies to
everyone.'

FT  25 SEP 93 / Major found alive in far East: Even if he seems grey in
public, there is plenty of vigour in private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING IS wrong here. John Major is a weak leader who is incapable of
offering the leadership that Britain so badly needs. I know this because I
read the Tory tabloids, whose antipathy to the Prime Minister varies only in
degree. But I have just spent six days following Major on a 17,500 mile trip
to Japan, Malaysia and Monaco. I got back feeling like a piece of used
Sellotape. Major looked like a man without a care in the world. What is
wrong with him? Doesn't he know he is in the middle of a leadership crisis?
It was, admittedly, a successful trip. Major struck up a good relationship
with Morihiro Hosokawa, the new Japanese Prime Minister, and tied up Pounds
1bn of business for British companies in Malaysia. And his prompt support of
president Yeltsin during this week's dramatic events in Moscow showed him in
a far more decisive light than poor dilatory Bill Clinton, who was still
'examining' the situation while Major was 'acting'.
But none of that really matters much, does it? Major's problem is that much
of the tabloid press, the institution which did so much to help him win the
1992 election, has decided that he has to go. It is not clear why. He is a
bit grey; someone has to carry the can for the recession; he is not Margaret
Thatcher.
In itself, the media campaign is not enough to dislodge the prime minister.
But it guarantees almost unlimited publicity to the right-wing backbenchers
whose vitriol poured every day into journalists' notebooks.
During the first four days of Major's overseas trip, the campaign was
unrelenting. Comments made in London were relayed to his accompanying party
of political journalists, who then demanded a response. Parts of the
exchanges were seen by millions on Monday when most television news
bulletins showed a clip of the Prime Minister's press conference in Tokyo.
The impression given is that the Prime Minister is being hounded by tabloid
journalists. He is not. Access to him is too infrequent and too closely
controlled by aides for that. This is why Major is so closely questioned on
the rare occasions when he does appear. But the conventions of parliamentary
language have not entirely broken down. The questions may be awkward or
embarrassing (sometimes to both parties), but they are always courteous.
Even Gordon Greig, political editor of the rabidly anti-Major Daily Mail,
has done nothing more than politely seek the prime minister's views.
Major does not seem to mind much. Some of his party were very angry about
the way the leadership issue dominated media coverage of his trip. Gus
O'Donnell, the Prime Minister's normally equable press secretary, went so
far as to call John Sergeant, a BBC reporter, a 'jerk' for raising it in
Tokyo. Major kept his temper, and even made a few jokes to his Japanese
hosts about the 'irrepressible' British press. Later, he appeared for a chat
in the journalists' quarters in the back of the Prime Ministerial plane. It
was not, colleagues tell me, a patch on his courting of the press in the
first year after he replaced Margaret Thatcher. Then, they sometimes had to
ask him to leave so they could eat. But what of that? I would not spend much
time with them either, if it was me they were writing off every day.
Nevertheless, a prime minister in this position faces an interesting
question which Major seems uncerain how to answer. Should he 'hit out' at
the rebels, or pretend they do not exist?
He moved into the attack early in his visit to Tokyo, when he warned the
rebels publicly to stop the 'stupid internecine squabbling'.
Privately, his strategy has been to belittle the rebels, casting doubt on
their judgment. Perhaps because he was frustrated by his inability to get
this message across through his officials, Major delivered it in person to a
group of journalists at a barbecue in the British embassy garden in Tokyo.
His remarks were supposed to be off the record, but they were attributed to
him by one newspaper, and hinted at by others - a breach of convention which
would have been inconceivable if the prime minister were not perceived to be
in deep trouble.
Later, it emerged that one of the journalists travelling with the prime
minister is in possession of a tape recording of a private conversation in
which Major refers to his critics as 'barmy.' The recording was made
accidentally; like the barbecue comments, it would probably have remained
private but for the smell of blood in the air.
This bending of the rules is more serious for Major than it may seem.
Unattributable conversations with journalists are one of the principal means
by which ministers communicate their views. If the prime minister can no
longer make his views plain without being identified as the source - though
his critics often remain anonymous - he will have lost a powerful weapon.
No wonder that he is angry and frustrated. Even if he seems grey in public,
there is plenty of vigour in his language in private. For example he said of
one of his most voluble critics: 'Every time I hear his name I hear the
flapping of white coats.'
If the tabloids are right, there ought to have been a palpable atmosphere of
crisis surrounding the trip. There wasn't. Major knows he has to exert his
authority, but he seems to think that all that is required is a bit of plain
speaking and a more engaging style.
Who is to say he is wrong. The tabloids are not all powerful. Most of his
critics are an unimpressive bunch. But the grey image will die hard. Touring
a car plant in Malaysia, Major looked at green cars, red cars, white cars
and blue cars. When it was time to pose for photographs, he sat in a grey
one.

NIGEL SHORT is trailing by a dismal 2-6 margin, and he has overlooked yet
another win in his growing catalogue of missed opportunities. The British
challenger's long-standing guru and chief coach has returned home to the US;
yet this has been a good week for Short, the breakaway Professional Chess
Association and The Times world championship at London's Savoy Theatre.
The games have been full of interest, sacrifices and complex tactics, as
both Gary Kasparov and Short pushed hard for victories with the favourable
white pieces. Audience numbers have held up well.
Meanwhile at the rival Fide world championship in Amsterdam, where Anatoly
Karpov leads Jan Timman 6 1/2 -4 1/2 , the players were so upset at the news
that Oman has backed away from its commitment to provide a Pounds 900,000
prize fund for the second half of the match, that they agreed an 11-move
draw.
The Oman bid always sounded odd. The official version was that it was
sparked by satellite photographs which showed eighth century chess sets and
boards, the earliest known, in the desert at the junction of two camel
routes. Later Timman heard that, besides himself and Karpov, only the royal
family would be allowed into the playing hall.
The match is due to transfer from the Netherlands next week, and the Fide
president, Florencio Campomanes, is reported to be trying to patch up
contingency plans for the series to switch to Hungary. Amsterdam city
council have made a late donation of Pounds 65,000.
The biter is certainly bit. When the original Fide bidding favoured
Manchester, Campomanes said that other UK offers were invalidated by lack of
bank guarantees, and that Fide had found by experience that non-guaranteed
bids were unreliable. Kasparov later commented that The Times's Pounds 1.7m
prize fund would demonstrate which was the real world championship, so when
Fide claimed a Pounds 1.8m purse it was a moment for Campo to savour.
But the evaporation of promised Dutch and Omani money is a huge
embarrassment to Fide. And Fide's own finances often rely on a 25 per cent
contribution from world championship prize funds.
The other talking-point at the Savoy was the abrupt departure of Short's
guru Lubosh Kavalek, who was widely credited with toughening up Short into a
resilient match player. Short's manager, Michael Stean, said that Kavalek
had returned home for family reasons, but Kavalek himself indicated that he
had been dismissed and said 'I had intended to stay for the whole match. I
think I prepared Nigel quite well.'
Kasparov's has three experienced ex-Soviet GMs while Short's remaining team
of analysts comprises the German No 1 Robert Huebner, Jon Speelman, the UK
No 4 who is helping part time between television assignments, and Stean,
whose active career stopped 10 years ago. There are no plans to add to the
group, even though the match organisers were willing to consider flying in
world no 3 Vishy Anand of India, a friend of Short's.
Some observers believe that Kavalek and Speelman wanted to start the match
cautiously, to compensate for Short's lack of title experience; but others
in the camp preferred the gambits and open play which have entertained fans
but conceded points to Kasparov. There is also disappointment among the many
young English GMs and IMs who are keen students of chess theory that Short
did not enlist their help.
For these players, the ideas centre of the match is the grandmasters room at
Simpsons-in-the-Strand, where Michael Adams, Tony Miles, Speelman and others
hold court. On Thursday they predicted almost every move, and Adams found a
subtle win which Short missed.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Classic time in Ontario
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TANITCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stratford Festival began in a tent in 1953 with Alec Guinness and Irene
Worth in All's Well That Ends Well and Richard 111, directed by Tyrone
Guthrie. The plays ran for six weeks. Forty-two years later the Festival is
the largest repertory company in North America producing classics, modern
classics and Canadian writing. It has three theatres and the season runs
from May to November.
The Festival bings Dollars 100m every year into Ontario, yet its subsidy
from Provincial and Federal Government is only 10 per cent. The public, hit
by the recession, is no longer booking ahead and so word of mouth has become
absolutely essential.
The word of mouth for Joe Dowling's irreverent and erotic production of A
Midsummer Night's Dream has been excellent. Deliberately aimed at a young
audience who does not norma11y go to Shakespeare, Keith Thomas's music
embraces rock, reggae, rap, honky-tonk and doo-wop ballad, the latter sung
by raunchy Titania (Lucy Peacock) and her back-up group of fairies.
Design is by Haydn Griffin, the real world painted in Fascist black and red,
the supernatural a riot of colour dominated by a hugely phallic oak tree, up
and down which tattooed Oberon (Colm Feore) and frizzy Puck (Frank Zotter)
clamber. The lovers, on entering the forest, are immediately stripped to
their underwear. What the production loses in poetry it makes up for in
comedy, energy and sex.
Shakespeare's rarely seen King John is a satire on political expediency in
which kings enter into cynical alliances only immediately to abandon them.
Robin Phillips's production, excellently acted and attractively designed by
Ann Curtis, brings the history play into the 20th century. Elegant chairs
line the sides of the thrust stage. The men wear frock-coats, top hats and
uniforms, the women tea-gowns. King John might be Edward VIII; the Bastard
wears a kilt. Queen Eleanor is in dowager-black, Lady Constance in
dove-grey.
The tete-a-tete John (Nicholas Pennell) shares with Hubert (Scott Wentworth)
when he arranges for Prince Arthur's murder is chillingly underplayed and
the stylised battle scenes all have the unmistakable Phillips stamp. This is
the best King John since John Barton rewrote the play for the RSC in 1975.
Stratford regularly gives audiences an opportunity to go to classics they
would not otherwise see in North America. A Greek play is a rarity. The
strength of David Williams's production of Euripides's Bacchae lies in the
acting of the two leading roles and in Alan Barlow's design.
The set is simple: female genitalia half-disguised as gnarled, blood-red
gates. The actors are heavily masked and robed. Ted Dykstra's Pentheus, a
humourless prude unable to sustain his macho image, wears a huge
thick-jawed, thick-set mask. He sounds like a college boy and looks like a
member of an American football team. His humiliating transformation into
drag queen in shocking pink, after Dionysus has persuaded him to spy on his
mother's orgies, is both risible and pathetic. Colm Feore's god, a perfumed
transvestite, has a huge doll-like mask with a sweet-sneering smile worn at
a capricious angle; the body language is riveting. The weakest aspect of the
production is the chorus, whose writhing on the ground in grass skirts is
not enough to suggest mass hysteria and orgasm.
Stratford, very properly, is committed to staging modern Canadian writing.
Sharon Pollock's Fair Liberty's Call attempts to understand present day
English Canada by exploring her past. The setting is New Brunswick in 1785
and deals with a reunion of Loyalists to celebrate the end of the American
Revolution. I did not always follow this flawed but intelligent and powerful
play about coming to terms with the atrocities of civil war, but I admired
Guy Sprung's production and the acting of the whole company enormously.
There are no longer any plays which can automatically guarantee good houses,
but Oscar Wilde is a safer bet than most. The comedy plays to continuous
laughter and Lucy Peacock's Gwendolen Fairfax enunciates her lines so
clearly that I thought she must have been directed by Professor Henry
Higgins.
The Festival needs a musical to balance the books. This year it has two.
There are people who come to see Gilbert and Sullivan and nothing else and
Brian Macdonald's tired revival of The Mikado has done good business. But
Gypsy, which was meant to be a popular money-earner, has been a box office
disappointment.
Though attendances have been up this year, a major priority for next season
will be to get more bums on seats. One route Richard Monette, the new
artistic director, may take is to import stars from abroad - which would not
be popular with Canadian actors; but it will be difficult to find stars
capable of playing classical roles and willing to come for the whole season.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Stern Richard, angry Hamlet - Shakespeare in the
provinces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE in government who thought Shakespeare had crept out of topicality,
The Tragedy of King Richard II (1597) offers this apposite observation: 'The
wavering commons; their love lies in their purses, and whoso empties them by
so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.' More broadly, the play asks
what a political community should do with a leader who presides over divided
followers and exiles dissent in this fine Richard II at the Royal Exchange
Manchester.
The director James Macdonald has focused on clear verse and sumptuous
costumes rather than the grand display, recognising that this theatre in the
round is no place for elaborate tableaux.
The result is a stern interpretation of Shakespeare's sprawling, brawling
pageant. Shakespeare's hindsight looks like the exact science it was when
the Elizabethan picture is imposed on the medieval world. Macdonald's
production keeps the tang of both, not only in the costumes (Kandis Cook)
but in the weight given to the prophecies and predictions the characters
make. The open sets rely on stark lighting and plain furniture, allowing the
action to speak.
The inward naggings of Richard's last scenes have to be earned by the
outward political manoeuvrings in the early part of the play. The production
achieves both: Richard's loss of control in the Mowbray-Bolingbroke debate,
his inequitable sentencing of both, and his fits of kingliness in public
contrast with the steadiness of John of Gaunt and the Duke of York, the
country's two wise men.
Linus Roache as Richard is all measured pauses and level quietness, although
he finds a 'kind of ease' at Pomfret Castle with the edgy lines 'I wasted
time and now doth time waste me.' Roache makes Richard a slight figure
opposite the tousled Bolingbroke (Neil Dudgeon), a model of purpose and
intent.
An intelligent production, as this is, often reworks overlooked or
traditionally seen characters. Ewan Hooper's strong Duke of York and James
Maxwell's febrile John of Gaunt are the voices of conscience. Their firmness
makes Richard and England into archetypes of political confusion, the
country sold off, 'leased out like to a tenement or pelting farm.' Plus ca
change.
The English Touring Theatre Hamlet, now at Oxford on its national tour, is a
surprising, breathless and unpredictable production built on simple and
clean lines. It avoids the theatrical cliches of Hamlet with skull, Hamlet
holding mirror up to nature not by passing them up, but by passing through
them rapidly en route to the conclusion.
The director Stephen Unwin has a lightly-cut text, a white set, a raked
floor and minimal clutter, so minimal that Polonius has to carry his own
curtains - a form of 'arrasment. The production's energies are focussed in
Hamlet (Alan Cumming), Claudius (Pip Donaghy), and Polonius (Trevor Baxter)
who carry the action forward with danger and suspense but keep each scene
plausible.
Cumming makes Hamlet angry with himself and disappointed in the world. He
stalks the stage, his mind fizzing like phosphorus on water, sparking and
smoking. His language is new-minted and his insights fresh. He makes 'To be
or not to be' come across as a man thinking things through rather than an
actor embarrassed to have reached that point in the play.
Baxter and Donaghy play quickfire politicians. They make Eleanor Bron's
Gertrude look flat-footed and unconvincing. She is a fine revue artist and
actor of Chekhov, most at home with intimacy. But Gertrude's character is
established in public, with other actors. She has yet to find the range. She
lacks the necessary rapport both with Claudius and with the audience;
without this rapport, Hamlet's appeals to her sound hollow.
The lighting by Ben Ormerod (who lit Three Hotels at the Tricycle Theatre so
well) lacks contrast, the kinds of shadowy effects in Olivier's murky film
version. The production should be pithier and even pacier by the time it
reaches London in November.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Impressionists by the yard - William Packer examines
the choice of a secretive collector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE early years of this century, Dr Albert C Barnes, of Philadelphia, and
his partner, Hermann Hille, discovered and marketed a new antiseptic,
Argyrol, which made their fortunes.
Barnes began collecting in 1912 through the agency of an old painter friend,
one William Glackens, who had stimulated his interest in contemporary
European art. It was a good time to begin, and while his collection
continued to grow, amounting at his death in 1951 to some 2000 works of all
kinds, it was in those early purchases that its strength lay. It would seem
he bought wholesale, for by 1914 he had 25 Renoirs and a dozen each of
Picasso and Cezanne. By 1924 it was more than 100 Renoirs and 50 Cezannes,
the final count 180 and 69 respectively.
In 1922 Barnes set up his educational foundation at Merion, near
Philadelphia, and the following year put 75 works of his younger moderns,
Soutine, Modigliani, Picasso and the like, on public exhibition. And, as is
so often the way with the latest of modern art, it was not well received.
There is no-one more sensitive than the abused philanthropist, and poor
Barnes took the rebuff very hard. Critical access to the collection was
severely constrained, loans out of the question, and reproduction grudgingly
permitted only in black-and-white.
So it is that the Barnes has been a somewhat secret collection, honoured
more by reputation than direct experience. Now, however, while the old
building is repaired and modernised, Dr Barnes's successors have relented -
just a bit and for just this once. Seventy-two works have been chosen to go
on tour, and to reflect in particular his first enthusiasm for the work of
his near-contemporaries of the Ecole de Paris.
They include some wonderful things and Paris is the perfect place to see
them, in the context of the Musee d'Orsay's own remarkable holdings of
impressionism and the post-impressionism. The obvious opportunity has been
well taken, where possible, to bring in related works from those collections
 -Seurat's three tiny figure studies for his great composition, les
Poseuses, for example, and Cezanne's small study for The Card Players.
Yet for all the richness of its contents, the French critical response to
the show has been decidely cool. Is there something in such criticism after
all, or is it simply the reflex of an injured proprietorial pride? Are these
lovely things simply too many good fish that got away?
A collection, of its very nature, is never critically definitive but only
representative. What it may define, and that intuitively, however, is the
nature of the collector's idiosyncratic interest and judgment. And the more
straitened the means, so often the more acute is the judgment.
In this case the selection may well accurately reflect Barnes's particular
predeliction for Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse, but it hardly makes for a
balanced show and the room of Renoirs, with which it opens, does the quality
of his judgment few favours. Renoir is notoriously the most uneven of the
impressionist masters, and any trawl through his oeuvre is sure to pull in,
as here, much dross with the plums. The trick is to enjoy the plums for
themselves and forget the rest - which holds true for the entire show.
Even with Renoir there are a magnificent early half-length nude, arranging
her hair; the later la toilette, with the girl nude and seated cross-legged
with her maid behind her; and the enchanting large composition of young men
flirting with the girls as they leave the Conservatoire. The group of
Cezannes is very strong indeed, with a remarkable run of still-lifes and
three quite wonderful portraits of the artists's wife that are worth the
trip to Paris on their own.
For the rest, faites vos choix - Matisse still-life, studio interior and
portrait of his wife; an eviscerated rabbit by Soutine; Picasso's harlequins
and young girl, nude with a boy and goat; an exquisite Lautrec portrait; Van
Gogh; the great Seurat. And among the clutch of portraits by Modigliani of
his last and tragic mistress, Jeanne Hebuterne, is perhaps the very best of
his late reclining nudes, a marvel of erotic painterly directness and
sculptural simplicity.

THIS year's new wave of Britten opera recordings amounts to a gramophone
event of considerable magnitude. In the last few months four have been
released; two of these offer works previously unrecorded - that is to say,
works excluded from the great 'Britten conducts Britten' series undertaken
by Decca during the composer's lifetime.
Seventeen years after Britten's death, Gloriana and the Beggar's Opera
arrangement arrive on disc for the first time, and the third recorded Peter
Grimes and second Midusmmer Night's Dream demand shelf-space alongside his
own unforgettable versions. Comparisons can be essayed with the 'second
generation' of Britten opera productions recently nurtured on our and other
stages. New dramatic insights stir listeners' and viewers' responses
freshly; the stature of the operas themselves is thereby confirmed.
Argo's Gloriana is the big deal here. This was the 1953 Coronation opera,
whose gala opening night now secures itself a place on every list of
Legendary Operatic Disasters: the gathering of royals, diplomats and toffs
proved unappreciative, to put it mildly, of the work's serious aspects,
above all its warts-and-all presentation of the aged Elizabeth I. Thereafter
Gloriana was neglected for a decade; in 1966 a celebrated Sadler's Wells
production nobly commenced the business of reclamation. (A Virgin Classics
video preserves its 1984 ENO revival.)
The new recording, brilliantly dramatic, passionately committed, will surely
take the process a good deal nearer completion. Doubts about Britten's
achievement may remain. One may question his overall success in meshing
'public' worlds (ceremonial grand-operatic scenes a la Meyerbeer,
national-opera focal emphases learned from Boris Godunov) and 'private' (the
intense, uncomfortable, deeply characterised relationship of Elizabeth and
Essex). Imaginatively as the pastiche touches are applied, certain
local-colour elements continue to suggest not altogether flattering
parallels with British and Hollywood historical-epic films of the same
period.
But on records, at least in so invigoratingly muscular reading as Welsh
National Opera's under Charles Mackerras, the music displays a compensating
breadth of canvas and distinctness of sound-world that seal up all possible
cracks in the dramatic edifice. Re-discovery of the Gloriana sound-world
brings with it revelation. The brassy fanfares - harmonically teasing,
razzle-dazzle yet worlds away from the externalised swagger of William
Walton's coronation music of the same period - lend extraordinary
psychological resonance to Britten's celebration of Elizabethan royalty past
and (as it was in 1953) present. The subtle, disturbing commentary of wind
and percussion regularly deepens passages of genteel verbiage in William
Plomer's libretto.
Britten's Elizabeth, a superb creation, calls forth a superb response from
Josephine Barstow. He wrote it for Joan Cross, a great singer at the end of
her career; had he done so for this latest incumbent, a soprano in full
possession of a thrillingly secure top register, he would no doubt have
exercised less caution in the placing of high notes. When Barstow takes the
part for the first time in the theatre (as she is shortly to do for Opera
North) the point of those difficult final speech-passages will surely be
made clearer. Everything else in the role - grandeur, dry wit,
flirtatiousness, brutal malice, generosity, tremors of uncertainty,
largeness of vision - is already brilliantly in place.
Around her Argo has arrayed a superb cast, hardly to be faulted, with the
luxury of several big names of British opera (Bryn Terfel, Willard White,
John Mark Ainsley, Janice Watson) in tiny parts. Philip Langridge, less
mellifluous than Rolfe Johnson in the ENO/Virgin video performance, catches
all the energy and attractiveness of Essex, impetuous, immature, delicate by
turns. Alan Opie's immaculately finished cameo of the courtier Cecil demands
special mention. The WNO Chorus covers itself in glory.
In sum I declare this one of the 'must-buy' opera sets of 1993. I would not
place Argo's Beggar's Opera in the same category. With some disappointment I
wrote of the 1948 Britten version - no mere orchestral enlargement but a
thorough-going re-invention - when reviewing in these columns the 1992
Aldeburgh Festival performance forming the basis of this recording. In the
Snape Maltings its artful underpinnings and other echt-Britten felicities
took one a long way from the scabrous vitality of Gay's original conception.
On records, however, many incidental pleasures come to enrich the
impression. With the exception of John Rawnsley's Lockit, the distinguished
Aldeburgh cast still seems to me too mild-mannered - and that includes
Langridge's expertly delivered Macheath.
I can deal with both the EMI Grimes and Virgin Dream more summarily. Both
preserve individual performances of the highest stature - Felicity Lott's
gentle, beautifully sung Ellen in the first, James Bowman's glittering
Oberon and Donald Maxwell's uproarious Bottom in the second. Both give
vivid, theatre-oriented accounts of the operas in question. Neither achieves
the thorough-going impact of its predecessors on disc.
The fact that Rolfe Johnson (Grimes) and Thomas Allen (Balstrode) tried
their roles out first in the studio, not on stage, comes through with
surprising regularity: one expects a good deal more 'personal' shading from
both. In the theatre Haitink can be a Grimes conductor of rare solidity and
long-lined viewpoint, but here his strengths do not quite add up to a cogent
whole.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: A noble bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICOLAI Ghiaurov sang a Wigmore 'Master Concert' on Thursday, thoroughly
satisfying and therefore remarkable. Recitals by opera-stars tend to be
dicky affairs. Sooner or later they get to the operatic arias their fans
expect, which are almost always disappointing with mere piano
accompaniments; for anything that comes before, they may lack experience or
aptitude.
Most often with Italian voices, the first hour or so is filled up by
18th-century songs and perhaps a little Rossini. French artists try on some
Gounod, Massenet or Debussy, perhaps even Hahn or Poulenc; Germans inherit
the richest song-repertoire of all, and are most rigorously drilled in it.
Artists from musical fringe-countries have to live up to grander foreign
challenges.
Without any hint of trimming his style Ghiaurov sang only recital-scale
songs, all in Russian but for the dry Ibert 'Don Quichotte' numbers. His
bass is magnificently black, stylish too, and unlike most opera singers he
knows how to shift gracefully into recital-mode. Though his short programme
might (for all I know) have comprised all the song-repertoire at his
disposal, he delivered all of it superbly.
In his opening Tchaikovsky group he was still warming up, but the whole-body
reverberations of his voice made themselves powerfully felt even before he
reached 'Don Juan's Serenade'. That drew as much upon his wry urbanity as on
the depths of his bass; and his Ibert songs exploited both on a perfectly
judged scale. After the interval he explored four Dargomizhsky
character-studies - penetrating, ironical, brilliantly varied - with the
utmost psychological finesse, and then explored Mussorgsky's Songs and
Dances of Death.
Those had more sonorously tender, open, shuddery, lethal finality than in
any live performance I can remember. By then Ghiaurov was calibrating his
cavernous tone exactly to the scale of the hall, with profound effect. There
were awed 'bravo's' - though his accompanist Pavlina Dokovska was merely
alert and competent, not much more. With a partner who matched him in stern
depth and weight, Ghiaurov would be mightily dismaying in this grim music.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Better music in the barn - Andrew Clark visits
festivals in Montreux and Mezieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK

<TEXT>
MONTREUX and Mezieres both play a part in late-summer cultural life in
western Switzerland. Montreux's classical music festival may be the poor
relation of the jazz festival, but it has been going for much longer.
Mezieres, a tidy farming village with an unheated wooden theatre, is where
the Opera de Lausanne decamps for the first production of each new season.
By road, Montreux and Mezieres are only half-an-hour from each other, but
they are worlds apart in atmosphere and artistic values.
Montreux has just opened a flashy SFr 55m (Pounds 26m) lakeside concert
hall, the 1800-seat Auditorium Stravinsky - designed and built by local
companies, and named after the composer who completed The Rite of Spring at
nearby Clarens. The purpose of the new hall is not just to upgrade the
festival, but to attract more conference trade. Its tall glass facade blends
well into the crowded shoreline of hotels and apartment-blocks. The
interior, however, is a shambles. The front-of-house has been fitted out
cheaply - neon lights, low concrete ceilings, ugly air ducts. Thanks to the
reflecting glass of the foyer, you cannot enjoy the spectacular view of the
lake after dark. There is no parking.
The cavernous octagonal auditorium - coated with the now obligatory bright
wood, reflector panels and lighting gantries - shows how little has been
learned from previous concert hall design. It is far too big and spread-out.
The acoustic has a quirky resonance, magnifying the tiniest thread of sound,
soaking up the loudest orchestral climaxes and turning everything else into
an undifferentiated mush. Judging from the concert I attended - a Strasbourg
Philharmonic Orchestra pot-pourri - the musicians simply could not hear each
other. The snappy chords dotted throughout the Poulenc double piano concerto
(Martha Argerich and Alexander Rabinovich) were never synchronised - through
no fault of the conductor, Theodor Guschlbauer. Wherever I sat, the platform
seemed remote.
A waste of money? Not when you consider how truly awful the old Maison des
Congres was. But Montreux has missed an opportunity, falling for the myth
that a concert hall and conference centre are much the same thing.
Multi-purpose halls mean multiple compromise, and compromise never did
anything for art. Montreux is also discovering that a new hall does not
necessarily transform the content of its festival. The programme continues
to be a haphazard collection of touring orchestras, some of them
second-rate.
It is a relief to move from the superficial glamour of one of Switzerland's
principal resorts to the rustic informality of Mezieres, where interval
catering is along the lines of a village fete. The 85-year old Theatre du
Jorat looks like a big barn. The benches may be hard, but the acoustic is
natural and there is almost tangible contact with the stage. Because of the
primitive technical facilities, producers are forced to simplify their
ideas.
This year's opera was Cos fan tutte, with another of the well-chosen young
casts for which the Opera de Lausanne has become known. At the heart of the
production lay Gilles Cachemaille's Don Alfonso, his stage debut in the
role. In common with his Golaud and Orpheus in previous seasons, he showed
an uncanny gift for balancing musical and dramatic values - spitting out 'In
cor di femmina' with a contempt that belied his vocal control. What an asset
he is - always singing with punch, style and natural command, but never
upstaging his partners.
Despite a fine rendering of his reinstated Act two aria, Richard Croft was a
prosaic Ferrando. Manfred Hemm's Guglielmo was nowhere near as effective as
his Papageno: the voice sounded poorly supported, the top under strain. The
girls were well-contrasted - Martine Mahe's pulsating, trouser-suited
Dorabella next to Amanda Roocroft's pretty-doll Fiordiligi. Both came away
with vocal honours, Miss Roocroft's luscious chest register underpinning a
radiant 'Pieta'. Jeannette Fischer was the spunky Despina.
Helmut Polixa's staging, designed by Carlo Tommasi, made a virtue of the
bare wooden walls of the stage, confining decor to a few stylised backdrops,
a transparent red curtain and a hydraulic platform. The setting demanded,
and received, the clearest animation of recitative, with taut human
responses from the cast. The curtain opened on a balloons-and-beaujolais
student party of the present day. Alfonso was a handsome postgraduate,
Despina the college skivvy. Both knew a thing or two about life and love,
unlike the four gullible victims of the wager. Polixa played up the comedy
and cynicism at every turn, with ne'er a hint of serious emotion. At the end
of the evening, the boys retired to one side, the girls to the other -
chastened but none-too-hurt by their lesson at the school for lovers.
Jesus Lopez-Cobos, conducting the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, chose sensible
speeds, and phrased the recitatives flexibly. The Grange sublime, as the
Theatre du Jorat is known, had once again worked its charms, inspiring all
who work there.
Renee Auphan, director of the Opera de Lausanne since 1984, has been
appointed to succeed Hugues Gall as director of Geneva's Grand Theatre in
1995.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Booker: where characters have survival in common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE BRITS are proud of our Booker Prize. The Prix Goncourt is latterly being
described as the French Booker. But lest we should become too
self-congratulatory, too insular about it, this year's panel, led by Lord
Gowrie, has ranged well beyond these shores in its choice of the six novels
on the short list.
The power to award the prize to any writer in English belonging to a country
in the Commonwealth or the Republic of Ireland has been taken very much to
heart. Every book on the list has a resonance hundreds, if not thousands of
miles, from the sound of Bow Bells.
One of them also has the distinction of being a first novel, Tibor Fischer's
Under the Frog (Polygon). Fischer was born in Stockport in 1959 to Hungarian
parents. It is the Hungarian expression 'under a frog's arse down a
coalmine' (meaning absolute hell) from which his black comedy gets its
title. What is remarkable about it is not so much the heavy masculine humour
 -it reminded me somewhat of the Czech, Schweik - as the extraordinary
authenticity with which it reconstructs the way of life of two randy members
of a travelling basket-ball team in post-war Hungary, their recipes for
survival in the period leading up to the revolution of 1956.
Most of the leading characters in these novels are survivors of one kind or
another. Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (Secker &amp; Warburg) is about a
boy of 10 in an imaginary suburb of Dublin where previous novels by this
writer have been set. The time is 1968; the likeable lad survives the perils
of reaching double figures at a time when his parents are splitting up.
Doyle has a wonderful ear for child-speak. He has reached this point in the
Booker stakes before but in the past has faded a couple of furlongs from
home. Maybe this time in a very funny book he does have the staying-power to
reach the post ahead of the rest.
If so he will be hotly pursued by two contenders from Canada. Michael
Ignatief's Scar Tissue (Chatto) is the most questioning of these books as it
takes us deep into that heart-rending condition, dementia. He shows us a
philosopher son who has to observe his mother slipping further and further
away into the land of non-sequitor and repetitious incomprehension. The
people involved happen to be Canadian, but the situation and the sense of
survival is universal.
Carol Shields is a novelist whose novels only began to appear in the UK
three years ago. She was born and brought up in Chicago but has lived in
Canada since 1957. Her novel The Stone Diaries (Fourth Estate) has, unlike
the rest of the list, a strong domestic flavour, a Mrs Beeton-ish quality as
she recalls the life of her heroine born in 1905. She goes through the
complete cycle of childhood, marriage, widowhood, remarriage, motherhood and
old age. Even if it does not win the Prize this one should sell very well.
The Australian, David Malouf, is the big international name here. His
earlier book The Great World in 1991 took both the Commonwealth Writers'
Prize and the Prix Femina Etranger. With Remembering Babylon (Chatto) his
Booker chance starts rather like Golding's Darkness Visible with the
emergence into respectable society, that of Queensland, of a barely human
creature who 16 years earlier had been brought up by aborigines. His new
life among the white Scottish immigrants and impact on them is described in
fascinating detail.
Caryl Phillips's Crossing the River (Polygon and Penguin) returns to the
theme of slavery which he has dealt with in earlier work. Here it concerns
the fate of two children. His insight into this condition - the subject of
one of last year's winning novels - is equal to that of Toni Morrison.
Lord Gowrie said on Kaleidoscope that he wanted the reader of these six
novels to feel 'passion' coming through them, to 'have an experience
analogous to falling in love'. Passion combines with narrative art in a most
interesting, well-chosen list that steers well clear of the expected names:
it is on October 26 when we shall know which of these writers has become
Pounds 20,000 richer.

FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Stuff and nonsense - Malcolm Rutherford has an
uncomfortable time at the theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING a play which one dislikes intensely, while others around are
manifestly enjoying it, leads to a sense of humility. This has happened
twice in the last two days, so since no theatre critic can wish to deter
people from going to the theatre, I shall stick mainly to description rather
than comment.
The two plays are wildly different. One is The Life of Stuff by Simon Donald
at the Donmar Warehouse. The other is Marvin's Room by Scott McPherson which
has moved to the Comedy Theatre after a successful showing at the Hampstead.
Stuff takes its origins from the big bang theory of the universe. There was
'loads and loads of stuff floating about,' explains one of the characters
towards the end. 'I think it was hydrogen.' Much of seems to have landed
anarchically somewhere around Glasgow.
The play is clearly intended as a cry of pain and possibly protest, though
of the four letter word kind that one had thought had gone out in the
theatre after the deposition of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Here is
a drugs culture dominated by a local mafia. Or at least I think there is:
nothing in Stuff is overt.
A relatively small crime - setting fire to a van in order to claim the
insurance money - turns into a larger one when it emerges that there was a
body inside. It looks like murder. Meanwhile all sorts of other criminal
activities have been going on. Someone has had his toes chopped off: they
are presented as cocktail sausages and consumed with apparent satisfaction.
There is a persistent mimicing of an affluent society. One man spends his
time trying to get into a dinner jacket, but has problems with the tie.
No-one else can fix it either, though someone observes that it is a mark of
civilisation for a man to be allowed to touch another around the neck
without intent to harm. The tie remains untied.
Offstage there is said to be a Volvo with a sawn-off shotgun under the front
seat, also a Mercedes. There is an endless supply of drugs and drink. Frank
Sinatra is repeatedly on the record player, especially 'The Wee Small Hours
of the Morning'. The economic framework is not explained; nor is the social
background. Presumably deliberately, characterisation and motivation are
obscure. At the end, the man assumed killed in the van comes back from the
dead covered in blood and with his clothes still smoking with fire.
Make of it what you will. There can be no objections to the acting nor to
the set and occasionally galactic lighting designed respectively by Neil
Warmington and Rick Fisher. The piece is directed by Mathew Warchus, who is
also responsible for the excellent Much Ado About Nothing still playing at
the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue.
For the first 10 minutes or so, Marvin's Room looks like a pleasant
surprise: a re-run of Doctor in the House transposed to Florida. There is a
wonderfully bumbling doctor called Wally, played by Ian Gelder.
Yet the fun for fun's sake does not last. The play is an American soap
written impeccably to formula. Laughs and sobs come in almost equal
proportions. A woman is dying of cancer, having nursed her sick father for
over 20 years. The estranged family gather round. There are two boys, one
goody, one baddy, even a trip to Disneyworld to bring the family together.
Sentimentality reigns: patches of Carousel without the music.
The performance by Alison Steadman as the dying woman is immaculate and I
much admired Carmel McSharry as her Aunt Ruth. Directed by David Petrarca,
Marvin's Room is a model of its kind made more poignant by the knowledge
that the author died of Aids last year.
If someone could combine the professionalism of Room with the occasional
volcanic energy of Stuff, there might be a very good play.
