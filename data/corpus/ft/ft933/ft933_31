FT  03 AUG 93 / Pay rise of 1.5% imposed at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC yesterday imposed a 1.5 per cent pay rise without waiting for the
result of a union ballot on the issue. The ballot on whether to accept or
reject the pay deal will not be completed until August 11.
Ms Margaret Salmon, director of personnel, says in a letter to staff: 'We
believe there is nothing to be achieved in awaiting the results of the
ballot and it is intended to implement the 1.5 per cent increase on August 1
1993.'
The BBC points out that pay settlements outside the public sector are
falling and that the government has ruled that public-sector settlements
should be restricted to a maximum of 1.5 per cent of the pay bill.
In her letter Ms Salmon argues that when the BBC is trying to persuade the
government to retain the licence fee to fund the corporation 'we must be
seen to be responsive to general public policy and voluntarily to adopt the
same disciplines that have been imposed on other public-sector
organisations'.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main broadcasting union, said the
BBC should have waited until the result of the ballot was known. He expected
the majority of staff would vote to reject the offer.
The ballot does not include industrial action and may be used as a stimulus
for talks on other issues such as job cuts. There are fears of further job
losses next year when new budgets are drawn up.
Meanwhile the BBC says it wants to introduce a single contract for
fixed-term workers. The 15 per cent pay premium paid to short-term workers
will be removed in return for limited pension and redundancy rights.

FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Naylor leaves MAM for a pizza the action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Naylor, who has been running MAM Leisure, the amusement machines
business which parent Chrysalis Group has decided to wind up, is moving to
City Centre Restaurants, the operation that includes Deep Pan Pizza and
Garfunkels. He becomes chief executive from the beginning of October.
'The timing was absolutely appalling for me,' agrees Naylor, stressing that
he was approached by the restaurant group in May and had decided to go well
before Chrysalis's decision to close MAM.
Naylor, 47, steps into the shoes of Phillip Kaye, who is 61, and has decided
to give way to a younger man. Kaye will, however, stay on as an executive
director, something Naylor claims he welcomes. 'He is someone I have long
admired from a distance. He has even more experience in the leisure business
than I do and I think I've got a lot to learn from him.' Naylor's past
experience includes First Leisure, where he was joint managing director
until 1988, Forte and Thorn EMI.
Kaye, who dreamed up Golden Egg and Strikes as well as Garfunkels, Deep Pan
and Chiquitas, will continue to be closely involved with new business
development.
Naylor's spell at MAM had only lasted a year. He came in 'largely in a
company doctor role, to see what could be done. When Chrysalis decided it
did not want to continue underwriting the losses, it was hard to gainsay
that,' he comments.
Before MAM he had set up Whitegate Leisure with an ex-colleague from
Columbia University MBA days, Nick Oppenheim. He parted company with
Oppenheim, with whom he says he now has little contact. 'An unfortunate act
of timing,' is how he describes the decision to set up Whitegate just as the
1980s boom was ending. Kaye on the other hand is not concerned by the
Whitegate experience: 'We did investigate it very carefully and we concluded
that no blame attached to him.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Kleinwort Benson Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeremy Lancaster, 57, chairman and managing director of Wolseley, the
world's biggest plumbers' merchant, has been appointed a non-executive
director of Kleinwort Benson Group. Lord Rockley, who took over as chairman
of Kleinwort in April, says that he had been looking for a successful
industrialist to help fill the gap on his board following the retirement of
Sir David Steel and the late Sir George Turnbull.
Lancaster, who has headed Wolseley since 1976, is well regarded in the City.
Educated at Rugby and Christ Church, Oxford, he did his apprenticeship at
GKN before joining the family company in 1961. In 1976 he took over from his
father, Norman Lancaster; since then the company's sales have risen from
Pounds 72m to Pounds 1.9bn and pre-tax profits have gone up more than 20
fold. Another sign of City approval came earlier this year when Wolseley
joined the FT-SE 100 index.

<TEXT>
Paul Bennett is retiring as chairman of Aquascutum, the upmarket fashion
retailer renowned for supplying outfits to Baroness Thatcher. Bennett is
handing over to James Stokes, who has worked closely with him as joint
managing director for the past two years.
Bennett, 65, joined the chain in 1960 as the company's representative in
Japan. He built up the Far East business from virtually a one-man operation
into one of Aquascutum's most important markets. After the company was
bought for Pounds 74m by Renown, the Japanese clothing company, Bennett was
invited back to the UK to become chairman and joint managing director in
1991.
James Stokes, 58, trained as an accountant and joined Aquascutum in 1962. He
was financial director until 1991, when he was appointed joint managing
director with Bennett, and has also acted as deputy chairman of the company
since 1982.
Bennett says he he has overseen the transition of Aquascutum from a 'closed
enterprise' to a subsidiary of an international group and feels he can now
'gracefully retire'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Patten in shade as spotlight moves to Blatch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLIMBDOWN over the national curriculum has posed more questions about
the political future of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, who is
suffering from a stomach illness.
It has also moved the spotlight on to Baroness Blatch, the education
minister, who took responsibility for reacting to the Dearing review in Mr
Patten's absence.
Mr Patten has had an unenviable job, balancing the government's ideological
commitments against the demands of the teachers whose co-operation is vital.
Labour yesterday demanded his resignation, describing the climbdown as 'a
severe embarrassment'.
But Sir Malcolm Thornton, Conservative chairman of the education select
committee, said he did not think yesterday's developments affected Mr
Patten's career.
Lord Skidelsky, a former government adviser who resigned from the Schools
Examination and Assessment Council in May in protest at the way the Dearing
review was carried out, expressed strong opposition to the decision not to
publish league tables for 14-year-olds, or introduce external marking of
tests, and called for 'better leadership'.
He suggested that the government should have persisted with publishing
externally marked league tables for core subjects. 'Maybe that's not
acceptable to the teachers' unions, but it's something we can defend to the
public,' he said. 'The government has never had a clear idea of what it is
doing and therefore the teachers' unions have got a lot of parental
support.'
Some observers are beginning to see Lady Blatch as a possible successor to
Mr Patten. After being appointed his number two after the 1992 general
election, she was one of a handful of ministers tipped to succeed Mr David
Mellor as heritage secretary last September. Her name again cropped up in
May before Mr John Major's first significant reshuffle resulted in Mr John
Redwood's promotion to the cabinet as Welsh secretary. Most recently, her
name surfaced as a possible successor to Lord Wakeham as leader of the
Lords.
A close confidante of Mr Major, Lady Blatch is a member of the so-called
East Anglian mafia at the heart of government - the small group of senior
party figures who live near the prime minister's Huntingdon constituency and
are on close personal terms with him. Other members are Mr Richard Ryder,
the chief whip, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister.
But her generally traditionalist views on education have done nothing to
offend the right of the party. For example her decision to allow schools to
select up to 10 per cent of pupils on the basis of their ability in
technology was claimed by leftwing educationalists to be a preparation for a
return to selective secondary schools.
She is credited with shepherding a long and complex education bill through
the Lords. According to one government official, she showed 'amazing
stamina' during proceedings that were at times 'tortuous beyond belief' and
demonstrated ability to master a brief 'diligently and quickly'.
She is a former leader of Cambridgeshire County Council, became a peer in
1987 and was appointed a whip in the Lords in 1990, moving to environment
after nine months, then to national heritage. She became a privy counsellor
in the new year honours.
In a government short of stars, perhaps the main obstacle between her and
the cabinet is the traditional sensitivity at Westminster about appointing a
peer to a high-profile post.
She will stay in charge of the education department for at least another
three weeks. Downing Street said Mr Major was delighted that Mr Patten was
'making good progress' in overcoming his illness and was expected to be back
at his desk in the week starting August 23.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Maastricht ratified as Rees-Mogg bows out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday ratified the Maastricht treaty just hours after Lord
Rees-Mogg announced that he was abandoning his legal challenge.
Ratification was completed when Sir Patrick Fairweather, British ambassador
to Italy, deposited the necessary instrument at the Italian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs just after 3pm.
The Foreign Office said the necessary documentation had been sent to Italy
by diplomatic bag over the weekend.
The move, which made Britain the 11th of the 12 European Community states to
ratify the treaty - Germany is the last - marked the end of the road for
Tory Euro-sceptics who had fought tenaciously to kill Maastricht off in an
epic 18-month parliamentary battle.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will be hoping the government can finally
draw a line under what has been an immensely damaging episode for the
Conservative party.
But Euro-sceptics are already threatening a fresh revolt when the government
brings forward legislation implementing an agreement to increase national
governments' contributions to the European Commission in November.
Euro-sceptic leaders were yesterday in defiant mood with Mr Bill Cash, the
MP for Stafford, arguing that Britain should not have ratified a treaty
whose heart was 'torn out' with the 'collapse' of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Mr Michael Spicer, the MP for South Worcestershire, said it was 'a matter of
supreme irony that on the day that the ERM collapses we ratify a treaty
whose objective is to create fixed exchange rates forever, with all the
economic misery that this has been seen to entail'.
Lord Rees-Mogg's lawyers said he had decided not to appeal against Friday's
High Court ruling which rejected his claim that the government was acting
unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without parliamentary approval.
Gouldens, his solicitors, said his decision had also been influenced by the
ERM crisis which had 'removed one of the key pillars to Maastricht'.
It continued: 'In those circumstances, an appeal is not necessary; indeed
there is not much of the union treaty left standing.' Lord Rees-Mogg and his
backer the international financier, Sir James Goldsmith, had agreed to go no
further, Gouldens said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Limit on sex bias claims is unlawful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS face the prospect of higher claims for compensation from victims
of sex discrimination after the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
ruled that Britain's statutory Pounds 11,000 ceiling on tribunal awards was
unlawful.
People who have suffered sex discrimination must be compensated in full for
loss and damage actually suffered even if that means exceeding the ceiling.
The government will now have to legislate to remove the statutory
compensation limit.
The court's decision was made in the second case brought by Miss Helen
Marshall, a retired senior dietician, against her former employers
Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority, which had
dismissed her in 1980 at the age of 62.
In 1986 she won a ruling from the European Court that she could rely on an
EC directive in her action against her employers for discriminatory early
retirement.
The industrial tribunal awarded her Pounds 18,405 in compensation which
included Pounds 7,710 in interest on her financial loss from the date of her
dismissal to the date of the tribunal's decision. In reaching its decision
the tribunal disregarded the Pounds 6,250 limit on compensation.
The health authority paid the capital sum but refused to pay the interest,
and her case was eventually referred back to the European Court.
Lawyers said yesterday the ruling had dramatic implications for UK
employers. Mr David Pannick QC said: 'It is of very great significance for
securing equality in the workplace.
'Employers will now know that there is no statutory limit on the amount of
compensation. They will be making more certain not to discriminate in the
first place, and they will be much more concerned to settle cases rather
than have them go to tribunals.
'Claimants in industrial tribunal awards will receive significantly higher
awards, if they have suffered loss that is above the statutory limit.'
The ruling was welcomed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which
supported Miss Marshall's case. Ms Kamlesh Bahl, commission head, said the
decision would not only strengthen the UK's sex discrimination laws but also
act as 'a further reminder to employers that it will be costly to
discriminate on grounds of sex.'
The commission said that the first to benefit from the ruling would be the
2,000 women who have filed complaints to tribunals after being sacked for
being pregnant under Ministry of Defence rules which were abandoned in 1990.
Mr Norman Lamb, the lawyer co-ordinating their cases, said the claims of
some of the women could now be as high as Pounds 100,000 or more.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Unions claim victory in fight over tests: A look at
concessions over education reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS' unions yesterday claimed to have won their bitter and long-running
dispute with the government over the national curriculum in England and
Wales.
The announcement by Baroness Blatch, the education minister, that Sir Ron
Dearing's recommendations had been accepted was hailed by union leaders.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, described it as a 'spectacular
victory'.
The struggle over the curriculum, laid out in the 1988 Education Reform Act,
culminated this year in boycotts of national tests for 14-year-olds and
seven-year-olds.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, appointed Sir Ron to review the
curriculum in April in an unsuccessful attempt to pacify the unions.
Legal challenges also failed. Wandsworth, the Conservative-controlled London
borough, took the NASUWT to court, claiming that teachers were under a
statutory duty to implement the tests.
But both the High Court and the Court of Appeal ruled that the dispute was
legal because the union was objecting to the workload caused by the tests,
and not the tests themselves.
Following the Wandsworth judgment the other two large teachers' unions, the
Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the National Union of Teachers,
launched boycotts of their own.
Mr Patten announced a partial climbdown in May by slowing down the timetable
for the introduction of further tests. This received a lukewarm reaction
from union leaders and failed to avert a boy-cott.
In June Mr Patten was heckled by delegates at the annual conference of the
National Association of Head Teachers. Heads cannot legally join the boycott
but they made calls for the tests to be abandoned.
They also widened the dispute by campaigning strongly against
school-by-school league tables.
League tables were not part of Sir Ron's remit but Baroness Blatch yesterday
announced concessions on this issue also. Plans to publish league tables of
school performance based on tests taken by seven-year-olds and 14-year-olds
have been abandoned. National figures will be published in aggregate form
and parents will be entitled to know their own children's results, but there
will be no formal league tables.
The government had originally planned to publish tables for both age groups
this year.
League tables based on tests for 11-year-olds have not been ruled out.
However, these tests are still only at a 'pilot' stage and will not be made
compulsory until 1995.
The other changes drastically reduce workload, and strike at the heart of
the apparatus set up since 1988.
The changes include:
The curriculum will be slimmed down with tests restricted to the core
subjects of English, mathematics and science until 1996. Sir Ron made clear
that he expected these slimmed down tests to remain the norm after that
date. Plans for national tests in technology, modern languages, history and
geography would be abandoned.
Prescribed curriculum work to take up a smaller proportion of total lessons
 -85 per cent to 90 per cent of time for children up to the age of seven
(who will concentrate on a prescribed core of reading, writing and
arithmetic), reducing to 75 per cent for 14-year-olds.
The number of 'statements of attainment' used to measure children's progress
will be greatly reduced. At present, according to Sir Ron, children must be
assessed on about 8,000 different tasks during their school career. He said
this was excessive and teachers would now be allowed discretion on which
tasks need to be assessed.
Plans to alter the national curricula for English and technology have been
abandoned until 1995-96 at the earliest to allow teachers some stability
while the new testing arrangements are introduced.
Teachers' assessments will be given equal standing to tests and Sir Ron
recommends that teachers' own assessments should be quoted alongside results
from national tests in school prospectuses.
The streamlining for the curriculum will require changes to the orders
governing the teaching of each individual subject.
Consultation will continue 'until the end of the year' on whether all 10
subjects should be reviewed simultaneously or if this should be carried out
in two stages.
Sir Ron also announced that he is to consult further on three other issues
which were not attacked by the boycott, but could also entail big changes to
the structure of the 1988 act.
The '10-level scale' which the curriculum uses to assess all children, from
the ages of seven to 16, may be abandoned. This attempts to use one scale to
show the levels all children had reached and to chart their progress over
the years. Sir Ron suggested that categorising all children on such a narrow
scale might have been over-ambitious.
Sir Ron will also consult on extra forms of vocational education for pupils
between the ages of 14 and 16.
This proposal was not in his original remit but fits with the proposal to
cut the amount of prescribed academic curriculum time and could lead to
significant policy development from the original 1988 plan.

a Continental style of education concentrating on vocational education from
the age of 14, which was generally welcomed by employers.
In a surprising addition to his report, Sir Ron announced that he will
consult until the end of the year on 'the merits of a modified approach to
the curriculum from 14 to 16 which retains a mandatory core but which
provides a smoother transition to study post-16, through a wide range of
options'. He said: 'In the rest of Europe, 16 is not a particularly
significant stage in schooling, and, post-14, many of our neighbours place
particular value on technical and vocational education.'
In France, Germany and the Netherlands 25 per cent of students post-14 go to
schools specialising in vocational education. The National Institute of
Economic and Social Research said earlier this year the national curriculum
in England and Wales had left less academic children 'disadvantaged and
demotivated'.
Continental employers believed pupils who had spent their time from 14 to 16
working on a narrow academic curriculum plus specialised courses in
systematic disciplines such as woodwork and metalwork were more motivated,
according to the institute.
Sir Ron's move was welcomed by employers, although some were alarmed by the
decision not to make testing of technology compulsory. Mr Ian Toombs, of
West London CBI and the Japanese company NEC, said he regarded the national
curriculum as a useful development but there were more deep-rooted problems
in British education than simply the content of the curriculum. A change of
culture was needed to integrate education, training and the workplace, and
the government ought to offer fiscal incentives for employers to involve
themselves in education.
Mr Brian Lindop, manager of educational affairs at Vauxhall Motors, said the
place of technology in the national curriculum had to be defended.
'If we are to compete in the international marketplace we need to improve
the skills of all of our young people in the technology area,' he said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Inquiry to probe Welsh agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT inquiry is being set up to look at the management practices
of the Welsh Development Agency, which were castigated last month by the
Commons public accounts committee.
A panel of three, headed by Sir John Caines, former permanent secretary at
the Department for Education, will carry out the inquiry. Mr David
Rowe-Beddoe, who took over in July as agency chairman and has set up the
investigation, said yesterday: 'The issues raised by the PAC report are
serious. It is important they are considered in detail and that prompt and
effective remedial action is taken as appropriate.'
The panel will decide whether further disciplinary action is needed. Mr
Rowe-Beddoe said the inquiry would be carried out with 'thoroughness and
speed' and would 'professionally close a troublesome chapter in the agency's
history'.
The committee's investigation came after concerns raised by the National
Audit Office on the agency's 1991-92 accounts. The MPs said management
practices at the government agency, which was then chaired by Dr Gwyn Jones,
had fallen 'well below' what parliament had a right to expect. These
included a redundancy scheme which had not been approved by the Welsh
Office, the appointment of a fraudster as marketing director, and an
'Operation Wizard' to consider privatisation in which consultants were paid
more than Pounds 300,000.
In the wake of that report, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, last week
warned chairmen of non-departmental public bodies to insist 'on the highest
standards of conduct'.
Mr Redwood's speech coincided with a report by the National Audit Office
criticising the Development Board for Rural Wales over the way it had
allocated housing under a set of rules separate to those made public.
Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West and a critic of the agency's
management, said yesterday: 'I am very pleased that David Rowe-Beddoe is not
attempting to brush the criticism under the carpet. I took it for granted
when he was appointed that he would make vigorous efforts to sweep clean and
I will be pleased to supply evidence I have got to the inquiry.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / Prescott calls for BR lease extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, the shadow transport secretary, yesterday called on the
government to extend British Rail's Pounds 150m leasing facility to enable
early orders to be placed for new rolling stock for the West Coast mainline
and Network SouthEast.
In a meeting with Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, Mr Prescott
pressed for a Pounds 300m leasing facility linked to a system of staged
annual payments.
Mr Prescott said arrangements could be devised which would not increase
concern over the public sector borrowing requirement, estimated to total
Pounds 50bn in the present financial year.
Previous Labour attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of proposals for
using the leasing procedure to secure new rolling stock have failed to
convince Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary.
He has said he expects BR to decide before the end of next month on the
tenders submitted for the Pounds 150m leasing deal.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Radio market shift claimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMERCIAL radio industry yesterday said that for the first time it now
accounted for more than 40 per cent of total radio listening.
Mr Douglas McArthur, the managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau,
set up to promote commercial radio, said new figures 'demonstrated why
advertisers are re-assessing their views of radio as an advertising medium'.
The latest official figures produced by Radio Joint Audience Research, for
the three months from March to June, show that BBC radio had a share of 57.2
per cent and the commercial stations had 38.9 per cent.
Mr McArthur, in addition, included the 2.2 per cent share of listening
obtained by Virgin 1215, the new national popular music station which was on
air for only seven of the 13 weeks of the research period.
The Radio Advertising Bureau said it now had a 'stranglehold' on the BBC,
particularly in London where commercial radio was taking a 58 per cent share
of the total radio audience.
The BBC countered by saying that two-thirds of the adult population listened
to a BBC radio station every week, giving an audience of more than 31m.
The survey also showed that more than 27m adults listened to network radio
each week and that the BBC's Radio 5 had increased its audience by half a
million adults since the last full survey.
The BBC estimates that 500,000 under-15s also listen to Radio 5.
The finding will make it more difficult for the BBC to replace Radio 5 with
a 24-hour news service following the row over plans to run the news service
on Radio 4's long wave frequency.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Tesco cut-price label challenges discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO, the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain, yesterday took on the
growing band of food discounters by launching a cut-price own label.
The move came as a survey found that prices at Tesco, on a basket of 40
items, had fallen 7.5 per cent in the past three months.
The launch of the Tesco Value label was seen in the City as a defence
against discount stores offering a limited number of goods at low prices.
But Tesco insisted it did not mark a return to the 'pile it high and sell it
cheap' philosophy for which it was famous in the 1960s and 1970s.
The 70 cut-price products, with distinctive blue, red and white labels, and
including many popular items in the fresh food, grocery and non-food
categories, will replace 'tertiary' brands - cheaper alternatives to
big-name and stores' own brands.
Analysts believe the recession and the growing influence of discounters have
led to shoppers switching from own brands - on which supermarkets make their
biggest gross profit margins because they do not have to bear the same
development and marketing costs as manufacturers - to tertiary brands.
They said Tesco was trying to regain some lost margin by offering cheap
products on an own-brand basis.
Mr Terry Leahy, Tesco's marketing director, said Tesco Value lines would
'enable us to more effectively communicate the value Tesco has always
given'.
Tesco's share price has come under pressure this year because the City fears
its younger customer base makes its profits more vulnerable to erosion by
the discounters than those of competitors J. Sainsbury and Safeway.
There have been rumours of a boardroom split between those who believe Tesco
should continue to compete with the other big two and those favouring a move
to lower prices.
A survey today by Verdict, the retail research group, suggests Tesco is
ensuring it stocks products at prices that can compete with the discounters
and Asda, the stores chain which is being revitalised by a new management
with a renewed emphasis on price.
For a basket of 40 common purchases, selecting the cheapest alternative in
each category, Verdict last month found Tesco (Pounds 33.03) was cheaper
than Sainsbury (Pounds 35.23), Safeway (Pounds 36.28) and Asda (Pounds
33.85).
Tesco was also cheaper than four discount chains - including Asda's new
discount format, Dales.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEAMS in Japan's seven-party coalition are already showing, with the
parties disagreeing over appointments to a new cabinet expected to be
installed formally this week.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the coalition's candidate to become prime minister,
returned from a mountain retreat yesterday to find the parties unable to
decide on senior ministerial posts.
This is partly because they have known only life in opposition and are
daunted by the thought of running the country, according to a senior
official of one of the coalition parties.
The seven groups range from the left-leaning Social Democratic party to
parties comprising former members of the Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Hosokawa's difficulty in putting together a cabinet has stirred public
concerns that the coalition could lurch from indecision to indecision after
taking office.
A new prime minister will be chosen at a parliamentary session on Thursday,
and the seven parties have the numbers to ensure that Mr Hosokawa will form
a cabinet.
SDP officials, already under attack from within the party for joining the
coalition, do not know where to place influential ideologues entitled to a
senior post but who could create policy chaos in a job such as that of
foreign minister.
The party has suggested that Ms Takako Doi, former SDP leader, should become
speaker of the lower house of parliament, but she has declined, suggesting
that she is 'not appropriate' for a position of such heavy responsibility.
Mr Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New party, will be standing against Mr
Yohei Kono, the new LDP leader, in the parliamentary vote on the
premiership. Unless the coalition falls apart in the next few days, the LDP
will be joining the Japan Communist party in opposition.
Mr Hosokawa has asked Mr Ichiro Ozawa, former LDP secretary-general, to join
the cabinet, but the latter said yesterday he did not want a position.
'In theory, the government should last for four years, but we will have to
see,' said Mr Ozawa, who is generally thought to be planning for another
poll within a year.
But Mr Ozawa insists that he is dedicated to overhaul a national electoral
system prone to corruption, though he suggested that the redrawing of
electoral boundaries will be relatively simple. 'The difficult thing will be
change political thinking,' he said.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Consumer fears hit new car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in Japan in July slipped 10.8 per cent from those of a year
earlier, while sales of imported vehicles were down 11.2 per cent,
reflecting the lack of consumer confidence in an economy still apparently in
decline.
July is traditionally a good month for car dealers, as it comes just after
workers have received bonuses and just before annual summer holidays, but
the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said sales had fallen by more than
10 per cent for four consecutive months. Except for March this year, when
they rose 1.7 per cent, sales have been down year-on-year every month since
July 1992.
The period of double-digit drops is the longest since 1974, and also
reflects the curbing of corporate capital spending. Lorry sales fell 9.3 per
cent, while those of buses fell 11.6 per cent.
Jada officials said the recent appreciation of the yen had further bruised
consumer confidence, which has been weakened by a cut in new jobs.
Meanwhile, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by
Japanese banks this year to buy their non-performing property loans,
announced that it had purchased 14 loans with a face value of Y64.2bn
(Pounds 406.3m) for a total of Y26.1bn during July.
The CCPC is paying less for the collateral rights it purchases, suggesting
that property prices are still falling and that banks are bringing in loans
of lower quality. By selling the loan rights to the CCPC, banks are able to
write off their exposure.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Singapore restricts Economist circulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE yesterday imposed restrictions on the circulation of The Economist
magazine, the latest in a series of moves against the media by the island's
notoriously sensitive government.
In a statement, the Ministry of Information and The Arts said the government
was restricting the circulation of The Economist, which is 50 per cent owned
by the Financial Times, to its current level of 7,500 and would reduce it
progressively unless the magazine published a letter relating to a story
about Singapore which appeared in June.
The story concerned the trial of five people accused of breaking secrecy
legislation by publishing a government estimate of second quarter gross
domestic product growth before it was officially released.
Headlined 'Psst - wanna see a statistic?', the article went on to discuss
the travails of politicians who oppose the ruling People's Action Party.
Singapore's declared reason for restricting The Economist was 'for refusing
to print a reply from the government', but the authorities are also incensed
by the magazine's occasional levity.
The Economist did print two of Singapore's letters replying to the article,
but a sentence was omitted from one of them.
Yesterday The Economist said it declined to print a third letter because it
did not want to publish two letters from the same person and the same
organisation in one issue. Last night Mr Bill Emmott, the editor of The
Economist, said he did not rule out publishing the letter in a future issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAI army has blamed Moslem separatists for a series of arson attacks on
Sunday, in which 33 schools in southern Thailand were set on fire.
No-one was injured in the fires, which were lit before dawn, but Thai
newspapers said at least 12 of the schools were destroyed or seriously
damaged.
Gen Kitti Rattanachaya, the regional military commander, accused a hard-line
faction of the Pattani United Liberation Organisation (Pulo) of having set
the fires.
'I was stunned,' Gen Kitti told local journalists. 'I (had) just told the
prime minister that the situation in the region was improving.'
Thai Moslems, concentrated in the south, make up only about 4 per cent of
the country's population. Religious freedom is guaranteed by the
constitution, but Moslems frequently complain about the influence of the
Buddhist majority, especially in education.
Pulo has campaigned sporadically for the secession of Thailand's five
southernmost provinces, and was blamed for a bomb explosion at Hat Yai
railway station last year.
The latest incidents could strain relations between Thailand and Malaysia,
since Thai officials say that Pulo activists receive support from Moslem
fundamentalists in Kelantan on the Malaysian side of the frontier.
Last month, however, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia launched a 'growth
triangle' designed to increase cross-border trade and investment between
Thailand, Sumatra in Indonesia, and Malaysia.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Hard landing in sight for Japan-US air feud: Michiyo
Nakamoto previews aviation rights talks seen as threat by Tokyo carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Susumu Yamaji has been busy for the past year on a personal mission to
save his company and the Japanese airline industry from what he sees as the
adverse effects of a US-Japan aviation accord.
As the chairman of Japan Air Lines, the country's main international
carrier, Mr Yamaji has travelled widely and used his contacts and influence
to deliver his message that the bilateral accord places Japanese carriers at
an unfair disadvantage.
His efforts will be put to the test this week when negotiators from the two
countries meet in Washington for a second round of talks that will seek
resolution of a long-festering dispute.
On the agenda are two thorny items: the number of landing slots Japan gives
to US carriers at the new Kansai International Airport and the use by US
carriers of their 'beyond rights' - the right to fly from the US to Japan
and beyond to a third country.
At stake is a large and lucrative market for international air travel to and
from Japan, in particular to the Asian Pacific region, but possibly
including travel to and from Europe in the future.
The US wants a much larger number of landing slots at Kansai airport than
Japan is prepared to give. It also believes that the beyond rights US
carriers are entitled to under a bilateral aviation accord should not be
restricted.
The aviation accord, which was agreed in 1952, gives each side the right,
among others, to fly over the other's territory and to carry their nationals
to the other country. A supplementary right provides for the carriers of one
country to fly to the other country and from there to a third destination.
It is this one that the Japanese want restricting.
There is already an oversupply of air travel services that is hurting the
profitability of Japanese airlines, Japanese aviation authorities say. As
primary carriers, domestic airlines should have first claim over flights
between Japan and other countries. US carriers flying mostly Japanese
travellers out of Japan are poaching, they say.
Furthermore, by pricing their flights at a lower level than that which
Japanese carriers can afford to offer, US carriers are threatening to put
Japanese airlines out of business.
Based on that view, the Japanese authorities tried to get Northwest Airlines
to limit the number of passengers getting on at Osaka in its New
York-Osaka-Sydney flights to less than 50 per cent of the total.
They then rejected a United Airlines' application to extend its New
York-to-Tokyo flights to Sydney, prompting United to file a complaint with
the US transport department. Threats of sanctions and counter-sanctions were
exchanged across the Pacific.
Both sides have refrained from taking further action that could raise
tensions but the first bilateral meeting last October to tackle the issue
ended inconclusively. For the US industry, which is losing money in its
domestic market, the market centred on Japan is enticing, given that Asia is
one of the few growth markets in world air travel and the US carriers are
more cost-competitive than Japanese ones.
Japan, however, needs to keep its international market closed to third
parties to help restore domestic carriers to health. JAL reported a Y53.8bn
(Pounds 340.5m) pre-tax loss in the year to March while All Nippon Airways
saw profits plunge 34 per cent.
To protect the future viability of its airlines, Japan wants to keep out the
kind of excessive competition that is hurting the profitability of US
carriers in their domestic market.
For that, it needs an aviation accord modelled on the Bermuda 2 agreement
between the US and the UK which restricts capacity and provides for a
balanced sharing of that capacity, Mr Yamaji believes.
Protection for the Japanese airline industry would not benefit Japanese
airline users, however. By providing Japanese airlines with a regulated
market in which competition is kept to a minimum, the Japanese authorities
would be allowing them to charge high prices and make profits without taking
fundamental steps to improve their international competitiveness, according
to Mr Takatoshi Ito, professor of economics at Hitotsubashi University.
'What has ruined the Japanese airline industry is the over-protective
administration of the ministry of transport . . . and the dependence of the
management of airline companies on regulation,' Mr Ito wrote in a recent
magazine article.
For Japan to ask that US-Japan market share in air traffic be
pre-established in a bilateral aviation accord, is as much a
results-oriented policy as the market share targets proposed by the US,
which Japan so firmly rejects, he says.

FT  03 AUG 93 / US steel union to have seats on boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HALF the steel workers in the US will have representatives on company boards
in return for more flexible working practices, if deals at two of the
biggest steel companies are ratified.
Bethlehem Steel, the country's second largest producer after USX, and
National Steel, the fourth biggest, reached initial agreement with the
United Steelworkers of America over the weekend. These new, six-year deals
would be double the length of previous labour agreements in the industry.
The agreements are similar to those already completed between the union and
two other producers, Inland and LTV. These have been ratified.
The new accords would cover some 50,000 of the country's 100,000
steelworkers.
Under both the Bethlehem and National deals, to be ratified within coming
weeks, union members would be able to appoint a representative to the board
and participate in joint committees with managements 'at all levels of their
company, right down to the shop floor,' the union said. These committees,
known as local boards, would participate in all decisions affecting their
area of work, including capital spending and planning.
Pension benefits would also be raised and health care benefits frozen. The
union would be given a lien on some of the companies' assets to assure these
benefits were maintained, the union said.
In return, steelworkers would agree to work more flexibly and be trained in
a wider range of skills to make this possible. Also, they would receive no
pay rise until August 1995 when the average hourly wage of Dollars 13.69
(Pounds 9.13) would be raised by 50 cents. They would also receive up to
Dollars 3,000 each in bonuses, Dollars 1,000 of which to be linked to
company profitability. The wage deal would be subject to renegotiation after
three years.
Bethlehem refused to comment on the deal, before it is put to the workers'
vote, beyond saying: 'It assures an uninterrupted supply of steel to our
customers for six years. There are provisions which allow an increase in
productivity, and which will result in a closer partnership with our staff.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / General Motors chief in rebuff to Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jack Smith, chief executive of General Motors, last night ruled out a
'face-to-face meeting' with Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the Volkswagen
management board, to discuss the bitter row between the two companies.
This has flared up over alleged industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production and purchasing director and formerly
GM's global purchasing director.
In a statement last night GM said Mr Smith and Mr Piech had held only a
'brief' telephone conversation yesterday. 'No face-to-face meetings were
scheduled between the two executives.'
At the same time GM moved to force Mr Piech into a public climbdown over his
implied allegations last week that the US company might have tampered with
evidence and might have planted secret information in VW's computer system.
Mr David Herman, chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, GM's German
subsidiary, called last night for Mr Piech to 'retract in detail the false
public accusations' he made last week, only a day before contacting GM to
seek discussions with Mr Smith.
Mr Herman said he was prepared to 'communicate in writing with Volkswagen
executives', but only on condition that such contact did not bias the public
prosecutor's investigation of the alleged industrial espionage by Mr Lopez
and other former GM employees, and provided Mr Piech issued his retraction.
Mr Herman said that, last week, 'without presenting evidence of any kind',
Mr Piech had 'implied that Opel/GM could have tampered with evidentiary
material in the Lopez case; that Opel/GM were abusing the public
prosecutor's office to the defamation of Volkswagen; and that Opel/GM or
their agents might have gained access to the VW computer system in order to
place secret information there that could implicate Volkswagen.'
Mr Herman said all of the charges were 'absolutely false, and if Mr Piech
believed otherwise his simple remedy would have been to present evidence. .
. to the prosecutor's office'.
The Opel chairman called on Volkswagen to co-operate with the criminal
investigation 'by making all material VW witnesses immediately available for
interview by the prosecutors'.
The extreme language used by Mr Piech last week against General Motors has
caused unease in Bonn. Calls from German government ministers for moderation
appeared to trigger Mr Piech's initiative to make direct contact with Mr
Smith.
Mr Herman expressed astonishment last night that VW had announced the
initiative without prior knowledge or approval by Opel or GM in the US.
He said 'such unilateral action could be interpreted as a mere tactical
manoeuvre'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Democrats declare pact on budget: Leaders in US Congress
confident of deficit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC leaders in the US Congress have agreed a compromise on President
Bill Clinton's proposals to cut the budget deficit, they announced last
night. The deal would cut the budget deficit by Dollars 496bn over the next
five years, Dollars 4bn short of Mr Clinton's target.
The announcement - details are to follow today - came after intensive
bargaining among Democrats over spending cuts and tax incentives.
The Senate and the House of Representatives passed different versions of the
budget in June. The bill, since amended, will now go back to the Senate and
the House for final votes this week before the Congressional summer recess.
Speaker Thomas Foley of the House and Senator George Mitchell, Democratic
majority leader in the Senate, predicted at a news conference last night
that the bill will pass the House on Thursday and the Senate on Friday.
'We have the votes. We will have the votes,' Mr Mitchell said. The version
of the bill which cleared the Senate in June did so only by 50:49,
Vice-President Al Gore's casting vote having been decisive.
'We are confident (of) a majority in the House,' Mr Foley said. 'We're not
going to bring it up to be defeated.'
The Speaker heralded 'the largest deficit reduction package in history, one
that provides Dollars 496bn in deficit reduction.' It includes a petrol tax
of 4.3 cents per gallon and it raises income taxes on the wealthy. Mr
Mitchell said: 'For a married couple with a gross income of less than
Dollars 180,000 a year, there will be no increase in income tax rates.'
The senator indicated that there would be Dollars 254bn in spending cuts to
Dollars 241bn in tax increases.
The White House gave a preliminary blessing to the pact yesterday. Press
secretary Ms Dee Dee Myers said: 'We think it's a good deal, something that
will be able to pass both the House and the Senate.'
The biggest motivation Clinton can offer for supporting the bill is that
there is no alternative, according to Ms Myers.
President Clinton, as a climax to his intensive campaign to win popular
support for the bill, plans to address the nation late tonight.
The outcome of the vote is critical to the Clinton presidency. If the budget
fails to pass, Mr Clinton would face a severe loss of credibility both in
his ability to work with Congress and to manage the US economy.
'The time has come to pass this budget and get on with it,' he said
yesterday. 'The tax burden is fair. Spending cuts will now exceed the tax
increases, and we are going to put it all against the deficit.'
All Republicans in both chambers will vote against the final package. Mr
Clinton's task has been to find compromises between the left and right wings
of his own party.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Reform of E Europe banks 'a priority'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL reform of the banking sector must be a priority for east European
governments and western donors seeking to implement economic change in
former Communist countries, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said yesterday.
Commenting on the EBRD's latest quarterly review, which showed how recession
in the west and last year's drought had contributed to a deteriorating
foreign trade balance in most of the region, Mr Sarcinelli said that the
existing banking structures were ill-equiped to finance the reform process.
Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics had gone furthest in
implementing banking reforms, but most east European banks still lacked
western-style auditing practices, had little understanding of risk control,
and were burdened by huge levels of bad debt, he said.
The EBRD declined to issue figures showing the scale of the problem,
claiming the statistics were too unreliable and politically sensitive. But
bank officials estimate that bad debts represent more than 60 per cent of
the balance sheet in some of the largest east European banks.
Mr John Fleming, chief economist of the EBRD, added that most east European
countries still lacked effective bankruptcy laws so enterprises were
continuing to trade and receive bank funding, although they were technically
insolvent.
'There is clear evidence of a big build-up in many countries of
inter-enterprise arrears,' he added.
The banks now need recapitalisation and the introduction of competition,
ideally through a process of privatisation.
The EBRD plans to increase its stake in east European banks, such as
Poland's recently privatised Wielkopolski Bank Kreditowy in which the EBRD
has become a majority shareholder.
It also plans to increase its provision of credits through local financial
intermediaries, in an effort to spread credit risks and boost local
financial sectors.

THE MURDER of two senior Russian officials has brought home to the Russian
public the increasingly bitter struggle between two ethnic groups in the
north Caucasian region, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Mr Viktor Polyanichko, temporary governor of the areas of Ingushetia and
neighbouring North Ossetia, was murdered when gunmen fired on his car late
on Sunday afternoon. Major General Anatoly Koretsky, commander of the
Russian forces in the area, was also killed.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy Russian prime minister for nationalities, and
General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, immediately flew to the Ossetian
capital of Vladikavkaz for talks with local leaders.
Mr Polyanichko, a former senior communist official in Azerbaijan, had
emergency powers to rule in the region as increasingly violent conflict
followed efforts by Ingush families deported from their homes to resettle in
areas of South Ossetia.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Recession abroad hampers industry

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of US economic activity quickened slightly in July, but recession
overseas continued to take a toll on US exports and the vulnerable
manufacturing sector, according to the purchasing managers' index.
The index, a closely watched barometer of the health of manufacturing, rose
to 49.5 per cent from 48.9 per cent in June. A reading below 50 per cent
suggests manufacturing is generally declining.
However, a separate report from the US Commerce Department yesterday said
construction spending, propelled by a big increase in government spending,
rose by 1.2 per cent in June. That was the largest gain this year, following
an increase of 1.1 per cent in May.
The purchasing managers' index, based on surveys by the National Association
of Purchasing Management, had mixed signals for the economy. Exports are
weakening but so are imports, which dropped for the third time this year.
There was some indication that that fall reflected a lessening of imports
from Japan due to a strong yen.
The new orders component of the index began to climb back in July, rising
sharply to 53.1 per cent. But another component, measuring 'orders backlog',
registered its first net decline this year. The inventories index fell to
46.7 per cent, down from 48.2 per cent in June.
Mr Dan Seto, an economist with Nikko Securities, warned of continued
stagnation in the economy as long as manufacturing business continued to
restructure.
The improvement in construction spending stemmed largely from increased
outlays for highways and other government projects. Spending in June rose to
a seasonally adjusted yearly rate of Dollars 460.1bn (Pounds 308.7bn) - a
gain of Dollars 5.5bn.
But private construction spending, a much more important component in
economic recovery, was up only 0.3 per cent in June compared to May.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Taiwan charts uncertain course over China: Divisions widen
between business seeking closer ties with the mainland and cautious
political groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS are emerging between the Mainland Affairs Council, responsible for
charting Taiwan's policy towards Beijing, and the unofficial group
established to conduct negotiations with China.
'We have our foot on the brake, while the Straits Exchange Foundation has
its on the accelerator,' says Mr William Li, director of the MAC.
His comment reflects broader divisions in the community - between business
which, by and large, wants closer ties forged across the Taiwan Strait and
political groups, such as the opposition Democratic Progressive party, which
counsel against a further slide into China's embrace.
Just a few months after historic talks in Singapore in April between Mr C F
Koo, the millionaire head of the SEF, and his Chinese counterpart, Mr Wang
Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (Arats),
Taiwan appears like a startled rabbit caught in a car's headlights,
uncertain which way to move.
For the moment, Taipei is unlikely to make further gestures in the direction
of Beijing, beyond maintaining the dialogue started in April.
Mr Jason Hu, chief government spokesman, says a Beijing proposal that Taiwan
allow direct trade and travel should be treated with caution. 'These are
some of the final chips in our hands,' he says. 'Why play them now?'
Business, on the other hand, is becoming restless, asking why it should be
subjected to the added cost and inconvenience of channelling its dealings
with the mainland through third parties, namely Hong Kong. The SEF, set up
in February 1991 as the unofficial intermediary between Beijing and Taipei
as neither recognises the other, has become a conduit for these concerns.
Mr Ching Ping Lee, SEF deputy director, notes that since an absolute ban on
visits by Taiwanese to the mainland was lifted in November 1987, trade has
soared. Exports are expected to total USDollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) this year,
and direct utilised investment exceeds USDollars 2bn, with many times that
figure committed to new projects. Mr Ching estimates that about 12,000
Taiwanese companies are represented in China.
He criticises the MAC's 'go-slow policy' as impractical, and says his body
favours more frequent contact with Beijing and at a higher level.
'Our aim is to reduce tensions and build up mutual trust,' says Mr Ching,
who visited the Chinese capital in June for talks following the Wang-Koo
Singapore meeting.
Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui set the tone for the latest phase in an
intriguing relationship when he said in May that it was important to
maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, encourage close interaction across the
divide and build mutual trust. 'To go from mutual trust to mutual
recognition that each government is a legitimate entity would be a major
advance,' he added.
Beijing, for its part, seems anxious to force the pace. Since elections last
year brought the independence-committed Democratic Progressive party within
sight of gaining power in a democratising Taiwan, the Chinese have
accelerated efforts to engage the Taiwanese in discussions about the future.
Opinion polls, which show that more than 20 per cent of Taiwanese favour
independence from the mainland (up from the usual 10-12 per cent), appear to
have concentrated minds in Beijing, where leaders had traditionally
maintained there was plenty of time to bring about reunification. For the
moment, it seems, the political tide in Taiwan is running against Beijing;
although the meshing of economies across the Taiwan Strait provides a
powerful countervailing force.
Officials of the DPP, which gained 51 out of 161 seats in Taiwan's
legislature with 31 per cent of the popular vote in the recent election, are
adamant reunification is out of the question. They want a plebiscite to
allow Taiwanese to pronounce on their future.
Mr Chiou Jen, the DPP's deputy secretary-general, cautions against the
Wang-Koo talks, 'not because China has a bad attitude, but simply because no
consensus exists in Taiwan in support of those talks'.
Mr Chiou is correct when he talks about lack of consensus within the ruling
Kuomintang, which clings to the notion that its remains the legitimate
government of all China. Some KMT members, however, make little secret of
their sympathies for the independence option espoused by the DPP.
The MAC, meanwhile, has been cast in the role of buffer in what could become
an acrimonious and divisive debate. Mr Li insists any step towards a 'united
China' must be gradual. He is candid about the political dangers. 'If we go
too fast the government may lose the next election,' he says.
He believes that Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, is a barrier to
swift progress because of his outdated ideas about reunification. Mr Deng
has talked about a 'one China, two systems' special administrative region
solution for the Taiwan issue, similar to the one proposed for Hong Kong.
Among conditions laid down by Taiwan for progress in the Wang-Koo process
are that Beijing renounces the military option to bring about reunification,
and that it refrains from barring Taipei's entry to international
organisations. Taiwan is presently engaged in a 'noisy reconnaissance,' as
one western official put it, to gain entry to the United Nations.
The MAC and other elements of Taiwan's propaganda machine have taken to
issuing warnings about the dangers to the local economy of becoming too
dependent on the mainland.
A recent MAC publication warned that 'with the rapid increase in Taiwan
enterprises investing across the Taiwan Strait. . . the threat that the
local industrial sector will be hollowed out looms large.' It cited a study
which showed that, in 1986, manufacturing accounted for 39.7 per cent of GDP
while the service sector's share was 46.82 per cent. By the second quarter
of 1992, manufacturing had shrunk to 33.66 per cent against 54 per cent for
services.
The propaganda also falls back on the perceived evils of communism.
'Communist Chinese leaders love to boast that what they practise on the
mainland is socialism with Chinese characteristics,' wrote one commentator
recently. 'We in Taiwan sincerely hope there will be more and more Chinese
characteristics, and less and less socialism on the Chinese mainland.'

<TEXT>
MR WARREN Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday said that the
violence in southern Lebanon last week had illustrated the price of failure
to make progress in the Middle East peace talks. He warned the participants
that 'decision time is rapidly approaching'.
Speaking in Alexandria after a two-hour meeting with President Hosni Mubarak
of Egypt, the secretary of state said the intense Israeli shelling of
southern Lebanon and Hizbollah's raids into northern Israel had served as a
'reminder to all parties that the Arab-Israeli negotiations can quickly
deteriorate if we do not take this moment for peacemaking'.
Mr Christopher's warning appears designed to put pressure on all
participants to the talks - Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the
Palestinians - not to allow the Israeli bombardment to preclude immediate
movement in the deadlocked peace talks.
In Jerusalem, however, both Israeli and Palestinian officials were
pessimistic about chances of a breakthrough in their negotiations during the
secretary of state's visit. Several members of the Palestinian delegation to
the peace talks, including Mr Haider Abdel Shafi and the People's party,
said they would boycott Mr Christopher's visit because the US continued to
back unacceptable Israeli proposals.
Even those Palestinians who plan to meet him today said they did not expect
a breakthrough on the two fundamental obstacles: Palestinian control over
Arab East Jerusalem and territorial jurisdiction over the settlements in the
Israeli-occupied territories during an interim period of self-rule.
For its part, Israel is urging Mr Christopher to concentrate on the Syrian
track of the peace process, which focuses on prospects for an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. Israeli officials yesterday
continued to promote the view that the crisis last week could be turned into
an opportunity to focus on stalled talks over the Golan Heights.
Mr Christopher said yesterday that, as 'partner' in the talks, the US was
'prepared to stay the course'.
The Lebanese government, meanwhile, yesterday decided to send troops from
the Lebanese army into southern Lebanese villages under the control of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Lebanese officials said the move
was designed to 'preserve people's security' in villages along the north of
Israel's self-declared 'security zone' inside Lebanon.
The deployment appears to be a gesture to bolster the 'understanding' which
followed a US-brokered ceasefire in the Israeli bombardment on Saturday and
in which, despite its protestations to the contrary, Hizbollah appears to
have undertaken to stop firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
However, the movement of Lebanese troops will not constitute an attempt to
disarm or contain Hizbollah, officials in Beirut said.
Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, has repeatedly said he cannot
act against what he calls the 'Lebanese resistance' while Israel retains a
presence inside Lebanon's borders.
Israel said that more of the 400 Palestinian deportees stranded in Lebanese
no man's land for eight months would be eligible to return in September,
taking the number of deportees to have returned to around 200, Reuter
reports from Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
TENS OF THOUSANDS of Romanian coal miners (above) began an indefinite strike
yesterday after the government had refused to give in to demands for big pay
rises, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest.
All but a few hundred of the 43,000 miners in the Jiu Valley, which produces
more than 90 per cent of the country's black coal, joined the strike, the
industry ministry said.
The miners, who led anti-reform riots in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are
demanding an average monthly wage equivalent to nearly Dollars 400 (Pounds
268.40), four times the national average, and lower income tax.
Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, prime minister, said the state did not have the funds
to meet the demands. It would be unfair to approve 'over the top' pay
awards, given that miners already earned more than 90 per cent of the
population.
Mr Vacaroiu, who met miners' leaders last week, refused to go to the Jiu
Valley to continue negotiations after unions hadfailed to appear for
scheduled talks in Bucharest.

service in North America for Apple's future on-line information services.
Under the Sprint-BT deal the companies would provide, in the US and Canada,

The International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC), a subsidiary of Agip of
Italy, will invest Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.54bn) in oil and gas development
projects in Egypt over the next four years, the Middle East Economic Survey
(Mees) reported yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
The specialist newsletter quoted Mr Hamdi El-Banbi, Egyptian oil minister,
as saying the new investments would be used for maintaining output levels
from existing fields and developing new finds, especially gas.
Mees said some of the main oil producing fields, operated by Petrobel, a
joint venture between IEOC and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation,
were ageing and needed maintenance work to increase recovery yields.
Mees also reported that the return of Iraq to world oil markets would
probably be delayed because of Baghdad's attempts to link oil talks with UN
weapons negotiations. However, Iraq's resumption of oil exports was not
totally ruled out, it added.

MR Alberto Grotti, former deputy chairman of Italy's state-owned Eni energy
and chemicals group, was arrested in Rome yesterday on the instructions of
Milan magistrates investigating political corruption, writes Haig Simonian
in Milan.
Mr Grotti's arrest, on allegations of illegal political funding, is the
latest in a string of detentions linked to investigations into the former
Enimont chemicals joint venture between Eni and Montedison, the chemicals
arm of the Ferruzzi group.
Last week magistrates warned eight senior politicians and former party
leaders they were under investigation for alleged political corruption
involving Enimont. According to leaked testimony from two former Ferruzzi
executives, the company paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) in kickbacks to
ensure favourable treatment when Enimont was established and when it was
wound up in late 1990.

THE MURDER of two senior Russian officials, one of them a deputy prime
minister, has brought home to the Russian public the increasingly bitter
struggle between two ethnic groups in the north Caucasian region.
Mr Viktor Polyanichko, temporary governor of the areas of Ingushetia and
neighbouring North Ossetia, was murdered when gunmen fired on his car late
on Sunday afternoon. Major General Anatoly Koretsky, commander of the
Russian forces in the area, was also killed.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy Russian prime minister for nationalities, and
General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, immediately flew to the Ossetian
capital of Vladikavkaz for talks with local leaders.
Mr Polyanichko, a former senior communist official in Azerbaijan whose
appointment as special governor of the region had sparked controversy among
democrats in Russia, had emergency powers to rule in the region as
increasingly violent conflict followed efforts by Ingush families deported
from their homes to resettle in areas of South Ossetia.
A state of emergency was declared last week by President Boris Yeltsin,
confirmed by parliament on Saturday. Thousands of refugees from both sides
have fled their homes in the wake of what Mr Ruslan Aushev, president of
Ingushetia, has called 'planned ethnic cleansing' of Ingushes.
Both sides blame the other for the murders. The press centre of the North
Ossetian government claimed the area where Mr Polyanichko was killed was
controlled by Ingush forces.
The Ingush president's press secretary said last night that 'the blood of
these officials are on the hands of those who tried to stop the Ingush
returning to their traditional homes'.

FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking Up The Pieces: Bundesbank gets room for
manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, came away from Brussels
this weekend with parting gifts of inestimable worth for his successor, Mr
Hans Tietmeyer.
The German central bank had been freed for the foreseeable future from its
obligations to spend billions of D-Marks in support of weaker European
exchange rate mechanism currencies, he said in Bonn yesterday.
He might have added that, for a while at least, the bank could get on with
its main job of looking after the D-Mark and German monetary policy without
harassment from other countries for rapid lowering of interest rates. But Mr
Schlesinger is not given to immoderate language.
In keeping with his mild manner, Mr Schlesinger's main gift to Mr Tietmeyer
came modestly packaged: 'Naturally, we have also gained rather more room for
manoeuvre for our own policies,' he said.
In keeping with the bank's tradition for Delphic utterances, this is open to
interpretation. Most importantly, it raises the question of how Mr Tietmeyer
and his central bank colleagues use their room for manoeuvre.
Mr Peter Lang, an economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, believes the relief
could prompt the Bundesbank to proceed even more cautiously than in the
recent past with its snail's-pace downward shift with the short-term
discount lending rate.
Recent indicators - not least an inflation rate more than double the
Bundesbank's favoured 2 per cent, and the inevitable expansionary impact on
money supply of last week's DM60bn (Pounds 23bn) of ERM intervention -
suggest the bank will feel there is no sense of urgency. With the external
pressure off, there will be even less.
In the recovery stage of the last recession, the German central bank slashed
its discount rate by 3.5 percentage points between August 1982 and March the
following year. So far in the current slump, it has taken since last
September to cut the effective 'floor' lending rate by just 1.5 points to
6.75 per cent.
Before last Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting, expectations had been
growing that the process would be speeded up.
Pro-cut observers had noted that the danger of a resurgence of inflation had
been receding fast. The underlying year-on-year rate was below 3 per cent by
the Bundesbank's own reckonings. Annualised money supply growth was tending
to ease back from above 7 per cent to the bank's target range of 4.5 per
cent to 6.5 per cent.
Then came the disappointment of a token drop in the penalty Lombard lending
rate, a new ERM crisis, and renewed criticism of the Bundesbank's lack of
sensitivity to its European partners.
Mr Dietrich Beier, chief economist at Berliner Bank, yesterday defended the
Frankfurt monetarists. If the outside world wanted to blame the Bundesbank
for the breakdown of the EMS, then 'it can also blame Germany for
unification.'
Few, least of all German economists, appreciated the scale of the
difficulties with unification at the time. But it is clear that while the
rest of the industrialised world is struggling with a 'normal' cyclical
recession, the slump in Germany has been compounded by the cost of making
good structural distortions incurred by unification.
The Bundesbank will use some of the time and room it has for manoeuvre to
continue to chip away, at its own pace, at interest rates. But it can also
be counted on to crack the whip over federal, regional and local governments
to keep the spending cuts coming.
Little wonder Mr Schlesinger yesterday declared himself 'extraordinarily
grateful' to Bonn for taking the initiative in calling for last weekend's
most fruitful meeting.

forexturmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS in New York expect the dollar to be a significant beneficiary of
the crisis in European currency markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
Although the dollar should remain weak against the Japanese yen, it is
likely to draw considerable strength from the ERM's troubles, and in
particular from the prospect of lower European interest rates.
Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, says: 'What you'll
see is a sharp decline in rates in all of Europe and, accordingly, the
dollar ought to strengthen.' Merrill Lynch expects the US currency to rise
from its current value against the D-Mark of about DM1.71 to DM1.90 by the
middle of next year.
Mr Straszheim is also one of several Wall Street economists who warm to the
prospect of the ERM's demise.
'The whole development was long overdue - the system was really not
sustainable. I am delighted to see the markets establishing exchange rates,
and not the bureaucrats.'
The dollar is also favoured by the likely future direction of US interest
rates. Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the US
central bank, recently warned financial markets that domestic interest rates
would be raised if inflationary pressures reappear in the economy. A
combination of higher US rates and lower European rates over the next year
will lure even more funds into the dollar.
Part of the dollar's future, however, depends upon the performance of the US
and European economies. Mr Joe Taylor, an analyst with Technical Data in New
York, believes the US economy will not grow especially fast, 'so the upward
move in the dollar will be somewhat muted.'
However, Mr John Lipsky, chief economist with Salomon Brothers in New York,
believes that financial markets will over-estimate the impact of lower
European interest rates on local economies.
'The European recovery will be gradual, and probably disappointing.'

The Bonn economics ministry yesterday announced an unexpected fall in
industrial output in June, following a sharp downward revision of
provisional growth figures for May, writes Christopher Parkes.
Total production last month was 1.5 per cent lower than in May, when
industry recorded 0.7 per cent month-on-month growth, corrected from 1.2 per
cent.
The June figure suggests that there is some way to go before government and
Bundesbank claims that the recession may be drawing to a close can be
substantiated.

FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Stalwart Spain suffers
sense of 'betrayal'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT SOME point during the crisis talks on the future of the European exchange
rate mechanism in Brussels over the weekend, the Spanish representatives
threw six years of hard monetary battle to the wind and asked for the system
to be suspended.
The anger, frustration and desperation of a strongly pro-European government
which has had to swallow three devaluations since last September (one in the
middle of a general election) was being openly spat out over the negotiating
table.
Perhaps the call for a suspension of the system was just a threat but it
was, for Spain, an extreme one. Spain has traditionally been one of the most
enthusiastic supporters of political and economic union.
But more than one Spanish minister has in the past expressed dismay at the
support given to the French franc by the Bundesbank while the peseta has
been left to suffer at the hands of speculators.
By late last week, with the peseta again under attack, the Spanish were
showing clear signs of pique.
'We don't want to leave the system but if we do they might as well stop
calling it European,' snapped an official in the prime minister's office.
But for all the irritation, Spain was not going to walk away from the ERM on
its own. Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, always hard put to change his mind
about changes of policy or personnel, has invested practically all his
political credibility in first taking Spain into the EC in 1986 and then
locking it in there by joining the effort to achieve monetary union.
Circumstances may yet force the issue, but it is hard to imagine Mr Gonzalez
suddenly expounding the virtues of a free floating peseta and monetary
independence should the ERM truly collapse.
But Spain also fears a free float because it distrusts its own capacity for
price and exchange rate discipline.
Madrid has been able to use the discipline imposed by the former tight
fluctuation bands in the ERM to attract billions of dollars of new
investment.
At the end of last year the country had external debts of about Dollars 78bn
and its economic managers see every tumble of the peseta (now trading some
28 per cent lower against the D-mark than it was a year ago) as a new rung
on the repayment treadmill.
'We need capital to develop,' says the boss of one of the country's biggest
companies. 'We have to keep the cost of that capital down as low as
possible.'
Not all the voices reaching Mr Gonzalez say this. While most continue to
press for fiscal virtue next year and for only slow cuts in interest rates,
some cabinet colleagues want growth even at the expense of inflation.
'What the decisions in Brussels (widening the currency fluctuation bands)
mean for Spain is that we have delinked from the anti-inflationary
credibility of the Bundesbank,' says Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief of research
at the merchant bank, Santander Investment.
'The Spanish monetary authority will now have to go and earn that
credibility on its own.'
That is the one side of the argument - that interest rates should fall only
slowly (and certainly not at today's regular Bank of Spain auction of
certificates of deposit) and the 1994 budget, due in late September, should
be restrictive and credible. Public spending cuts would deepen the recession
but could rapidly improve both the current account and public sector
deficits.
Mr Gonzalez has already promised big cuts and, although he is also trying to
sweet-talk the trades unions into signing a long-term wages deal, he has
refused to exclude social services from fiscal surgery in next year's
budget. The intention is good but this year's budget was also supposed to be
tight and spending is currently more than Pta1,000bn (Pounds 4.8bn) over
target.
Then there is the other argument. If interest rates fall sharply, the
dramatic growth in unemployment - currently a record 22.2 per cent - might
be brought to a quick stop. Mr Jose Borrell, the minister of public works,
is said to favour growth over the fight against inflation and is a favourite
of Mr Gonzalez.
Whatever happens Mr Gonzalez will have little trouble imposing his will.
Since winning the general election on June 6, he has cleared his cabinet of
left-wingers and placed his trusted and combative former finance minister,
Mr Carlos Solchaga, in charge of the parliamentary party.
He has also replaced his left-wing chief of staff with the former chief of
the revenue service, Mr Antonio Zabalza.
The consensus is that the cautious voices will prevail and that Mr Gonzalez
will agree to bring down interest rates slowly and not rush for growth. For
now, he is his own man.

high German rates

<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday blamed high German
interest rates for the currency crisis within the European exchange rate
mechanism which has ended the strong link between the French franc and the
D-Mark.
The prime minister said he had favoured a temporary withdrawal of the D-Mark
from the ERM to ease the strains on the currency system but that the French
government had agreed to a widening of the bands within which ERM currencies
can fluctuate to preserve the process of European integration.
Mr Balladur said the French government would remain committed to the
stability of the franc. However the French currency came under strong
pressure on the foreign exchange markets.
Political commentators in Paris said that a sustained decline in the franc
would seriously damage the government's credibility. 'The strong franc has
been at the centre of the government's policies,' said one Paris-based
diplomat. 'The easing of the D-Mark link represents a big risk.'
Mr Balladur said that the French government had favoured a 'holiday' for the
D-Mark to allow Germany to absorb the impact of the costs of unification.
But he expressed satisfaction with the compromise agreed in Brussels because
it prevented a devaluation of the franc and ensured the survival of the ERM.
'The European Monetary System remains in working order with a considerable
loosening, but its founding principles remain in effect,' the prime minister
said.
Mr Balladur admitted that the negotiations in Brussels had been difficult.
Privately, French officials said that disputes with Germany had threatened
to deadlock the negotiations on two occasions. But the French prime minister
said that the Franco-German relationship 'remains the basis for any European
construction that is solid and durable'.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, said that the decision to
widen the margins for ERM currencies was 'the best solution for the crisis
in the ERM'. He added that the franc 'would support itself well' over the
coming days.
Political commentators in Paris said that the weakening of the franc/D-Mark
link could exacerbate divisions in the ruling RPR-UDF coalition.
Such concerns were eased slightly by a vote of support from Mr Jacques
Chirac, head of the prime minister's Gaullist RPR party. 'I fully approve of
the government's stance, notably in the monetary negotiations of the past
few days,' said Mr Chirac, who has previously displayed an equivocal stance
on the strong franc policy.
The Paris stock market reacted enthusiastically to the reform of the ERM.
The CAC-40 index rose by more than 2 per cent to close at 2,129 on hopes
that the easing of the currency link with Germany would allow interest rate
cuts in France.

GERMAN INDUSTRY expects to take one step backward, followed, possibly, by
two steps forward as a result of the weekend shakeout of the European
monetary system.
But yesterday, labouring under the twin burdens of recession and
restructuring, it was more concerned with the first stage of the process
than the longer-term possibilities.
Daimler-Benz, for example, which generates well over 20 per cent of its
sales among its European neighbours, warned of a marked increase in exchange
rate risks for international groups like itself. Any revaluation of the
D-Mark against EMS currencies would tend to depress the group's profit
position, it said.
The VDMA engineering industry association welcomed weekend efforts to save
the system from complete collapse but complained that the loosening of
fluctuation bands had deprived its members of a useful basis for
calculations.
'We need stable exchange rates because we have long development times,' a
spokesman said.
Economists expected an early but modest effective revaluation of the D-Mark
against the French franc, which would damage German exporters'
competitiveness initially. Some 17 per cent of all German sales abroad go to
France.
However, economists suggested, that would eventually be offset by increased
demand as customer countries spurred economic growth by reducing their
domestic interest rates.
At the same time, the reduction in German import prices, implied by a D-Mark
with improved buying power, could encourage the Bundesbank to continue
cutting its rates, and thus bolster internal demand.
Most eyes were on France, where Mr Dietrich Beier, chief economist of the
Berliner Bank expected a devaluation of '5 per cent but not more.' This is
the engineering industry's most important single export market, accounting
last year for sales of DM12bn (Pounds 4.64bn), 10.3 per cent of the sector's
business outside Germany.
The French industry was also highly competitive, and with a greater relative
price advantage, might win market share in Germany, the spokesman added.
Italian manufacturers, too, could benefit from a D-Mark revaluation.
Mr Bodo Bottcher, head of the ZVEI electrical and electronics industry
association, said if his members wanted to hold on to their European market
shares, they could only do it at the cost of reduced profits. The need for
hedging measures to cover currency risks would also increase costs.
The VDA, representing motor vehicle makers, warned of 'considerable injury'
to sales prospects in France, which absorbs 11 per cent of German car
exports.
But the benefits do not flow only one way - out of Germany. Daimler, for
example, which has D-Mark sales in France of more than DM2bn, also buys
DM1.5bn worth of French goods each year.
And not all industry representatives saw the future as black. There was
widespread relief that the structure of the EMS, although greatly loosened,
remained intact with the prospect of a return to closer links in the future.
The BDI federation of German industry said the central idea of creating a
European zone of stable exchange rates had been brought into question.
However, Mr Reinhard Kudis, the federation's senior economist, felt the
gloom had been overdone. 'A revaluation of the D-Mark is unrealistic and is
only the result of temporary speculation,' he said.
The DIHT association of chambers of commerce agreed. 'Further exchange rate
developments within the EMS certainly do not need to be dramatic,' it said
in a statement. 'Negative consequences for German exports as a result of a
further revaluation of the D-Mark are by no means unavoidable.'
Mr Michael Fuchs, representing wholesalers and exporters, said he did not
expect the pressure on the French franc to last long. 'Given the weaknesses
in the German economy at present, we could even see the exchange rate
reversing in favour of the franc in two or three months,' he said.
Bankers, however, were more sceptical. Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the
federal banking association, said the widening of the ERM fluctuation
corridors was a 'second best' solution. Realignments, in accordance with the
rules of the EMS would have been better, but this solution had been avoided
because in many cases it would have meant a devaluation, he said in a radio
interview.
A formal statement from his association noted that the EMS had 'above all,
not collapsed.' But the existence of the EMS could only be guaranteed if all
members persisted with policies aimed at maintaining monetary stability and
consolidating budgets. Only then would plans for European economic and
monetary union have a realistic chance.

FRENCH politicians and industrialists were yesterday grappling with a new
set of risks and rewards as the government's franc fort policy of
maintaining a stable currency looked close to collapse.
The widening of fluctuation bands for the French currency from 2.25 per cent
to 15 per cent leaves the franc more than ever vulnerable to the foreign
exchange markets. But by decoupling the franc from its rigid D-Mark parity,
the move may also provide the scope for the interest rate cuts that are
necessary to revive the economy and sharpen the competitive edge of French
exporters.
The foreign exchange markets yesterday seemed to be pointing towards a franc
faible (weak franc). However, most economists cautioned against a snap
judgment on the fate of the franc.
'Of course we can expect strong pressure in the short term,' said Ms Marie
Owens-Thomson, international economist at Midland Global Markets. 'But once
the market finds its feet the franc should stabilise at between FFr3.50 and
FFr3.55 to the D-Mark.'
The consensus view is that there is little prospect of the franc
depreciating by the full amount permitted by its more flexible fluctuation
band.
Political considerations will encourage the government to limit the fall in
the franc. 'The strong franc has become an important symbol of French
identity,' says one Paris-based diplomat. Mr Edouard Balladur's government
has committed itself to maintaining the stability of the currency and its
parity with the D-Mark.
But the government is also determined to reduce interest rates to stimulate
the economy. 'Ultimately, the French people are much more concerned by the
prospect of unemployment than by the stability of the franc,' said Mr
Dominique Mosi, deputy director of the French Institute for International
Relations. 'There will be a lot of Frenchmen who think a weaker franc may be
bad for our pride but good for our economy.'
Yesterday the government played down the prospects of rapid cuts in interest
rates, emphasising instead the need to keep the currency stable. 'The
absolute priority is the stability of the currency both internally and
externally,' said Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister. But
reduced borrowing rates are clearly on the agenda.
'We want to open the way to interest rate cuts by unblocking the EMS
(European Monetary System) constraint,' said Mr Alain Madelin, minister for
small business, who advocated floating the franc in December last year.
According to Mr Madelin, there was no contradiction between maintaining the
value of the franc and reducing interest rates. He argued that the assaults
on the franc during the ERM crisis were not a result of the fundamentals of
the French economy and that the stimulatory effects of interest rate cuts
would restore confidence in the foreign exchange markets. He believed it
should be possible to reduce intervention rates  - which set the floor for
money market interest rates - from the current level of 6.75 per cent to
about 4 per cent.
Economists are largely in agreement. 'The fundamentals are strong,' said Mr
Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'Inflation
is half the rate it is in Germany and exporters will be given a boost by any
depreciation.'
French companies were almost universally positive about the prospect of
lower interest rates. Although most large companies have placed the bulk of
their debt at fixed interest rates, many have faced steep bills for the
interest payments on their short-term borrowings, such as bank overdrafts,
at floating rates. Small companies tend to have less sophisticated financial
arrangements and have been badly affected by high interest rates.
'There is no question that lower rates will ease the financial pressure on
the corporate sector,' said Mr David Harrington, French market strategist at
James Capel in Paris. 'And they should eventually help to restore confidence
in the domestic economy.'
Meanwhile, any weakening in the franc augurs well for exporters. 'It's good
news for us,' said Mr Claude Taittinger, chairman of Taittinger, the French
champagne house which relies on exports for two thirds of turnover.
Other companies have also suffered. The total value of French exports fell
by 12 per cent to FFr279bn (Pounds 31.8bn) in the first quarter of this
year, according to the Customs Office. The car industry suffered a 20 per
cent fall in foreign sales during that period.
French exporters cannot expect to see an improvement across the board, given
that a number of European currencies are likely to fall with the franc.
However they ought to become more competitive in stronger currency markets
such as Germany, the UK and US.
One of the main arguments in favour of the franc fort policy was that it
created a stable currency for exporters. But most companies yesterday seemed
willing to view the risk of instability as a cheap price to pay for greater
competitiveness in their export markets.
'The only real problem would be if the currency markets became very
unstable,' said Mr Taittinger. 'After all, we want to concentrate on making
champagne, not on gambling on exchange rates. We don't want the franc to
become a yo-yo.'

positive view

INTEREST RATE cuts in Europe could speed up economic recovery in Britain.
But the benefits of stronger European growth need to be weighed against loss
of UK competitiveness in big continental economies such as France, as well
as the uncertainty and instability of effectively floating exchange rates.
With the scope for exchange rate fluctuations so wide, UK industrialists
were yesterday facing the problem they used to face before the European
exchange rate mechanism was established: how to assess prospects for the
newly liberated currencies.
'I would be surprised to find any UK exporter or importer signing a contract
for anything over the next few days,' said Mr Richard Brown, deputy
director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce. 'They just won't know
what it is worth.'
Even in the longer term, currency instability could upset business. Said Mr
Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries: 'It is all
very well talking about lower interest rates boosting growth, but currency
instability does impact on trade. It is what causes protectionist
pressures.'
Volatile exchange rates are unlikely, however, to upset the advances
exporters have made since sterling was devalued. Britain had a 10-month
start over the countries that devalued yesterday and interest rate cuts in
Europe - if or when they come - will make it easier for the UK government to
cap sterling's rise with further rate cuts of its own, allowing the pound to
stay competitive.
'Our exporters have done well in European markets, so stand to do well from
European growth,' said Mr Brown.
The companies that will suffer most are likely to be those that compete
directly with France and are particularly price sensitive, such as chemicals
and pharmaceuticals.
Yet, on balance, most economists believe the boost to UK exports from faster
growth in Europe will outweigh the loss of competitiveness.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry
said: 'If the new ERM arrangements allow France and other European economies
to cut interest rates and boost growth, then that would be good news for
British business. The chancellor should be ready to cut UK rates if rates
fall elsewhere, or if the pound rises sharply.'
A possible negative factor for European growth and for UK exports, is that
the stronger D-Mark might slow Germany's recovery from recession.
'Germany needs a stronger D-Mark like it needs a hole in the head, and so
does Europe,' said Mr Freeman of ICI.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Near term, the
stronger D-Mark is likely to deepen the German recession and reduce
inflation pressures. Thus, hopes for an early recovery in Germany are even
more tenuous than had previously been the case.'
Alternatively, the appreciation of the D-Mark versus other ERM currencies
strengthens the argument that German interest rates will fall further than
expected, paving the way for more aggressive cuts across the rest of Europe.
There was a degree of disappointment that plans for monetary union and a
single currency have suffered a set-back.
Mr Brown said UK industrialists would be disappointed that monetary union
was further away, while Mr Freeman said he feared that the problems of the
ERM would slow completion of the European single market.
The UK's Institute of Directors believes a 'single' currency is off the
agenda for the foreseeable future. However, Mr Peter Morgan,
director-general, said European finance ministers should 'give urgent
consideration to the adoption of a 'common' currency, in parallel with
national currencies to restore stability'.
Such a common currency could be used by businesses to reduce the cost of
cross-border transactions, he said.
Economists were reluctant to quantify what the revamped ERM meant for growth
in the UK. Most agreed, however, that the net effect, while slim, would at
least be positive.

harmony - How ministers agreed to march to common tune

IT WAS Mr Karlheinz von den Driesch, the amiable, grey-bearded spokesman for
the German finance ministry, who first broke the news.
Stepping into the foyer of the Borschette building in the centre of
Brussels, he pushed his way through a wall of television cameras and frantic
reporters, to whisper five words to a familiar German journalist: 'Wide
fluctuation bands for everyone.'
At 1.45am - just 15 minutes before the Tokyo financial markets opened - the
world learned that European Community finance ministers had, after a
fashion, saved the European exchange rate mechanism.
The ministerial meeting was a tense, at times brutal power-struggle
involving almost 60 officials from 12 member states, including central bank
governors and members of the European Commission. It led to a solution
which, in the words of Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, is 'the worst but
one solution'.
Each state had its own 'bottom line'; each had a de facto veto on the
outcome of the crisis talks which began on Saturday afternoon with a
seven-hour session of the secretive EC monetary committee.
That meeting produced only the barest agreement on principles: that the ERM
and its central parity grid had to be preserved. There was no agreement on
how this goal was to be achieved, according to an official.
The main difficulty centred on France's absolute refusal to countenance a
devaluation of the franc, and Germany's absolute insistence that the
Bundesbank could not be expected to offer unlimited intervention - not least
because of the risk of bloating its money supply and triggering a new spiral
of inflation.
In the early afternoon session on Sunday, Franco-German divisions appeared
momentarily to have abated when Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, and
Mr Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, put forward a joint
initiative suggesting the D-Mark leave the ERM.
A European monetary official said Germany's preferred solution was to widen
the margins of fluctuation for all ERM currencies in order to limit
intervention; but the exit of the D-Mark suggested an apparent willingness
to patch up differences with the French. It led to Mr von den Driesch's
confident prediction - 'There is a solution' - followed by a report from
Paris that Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, was due to hold a
news conference at 7pm.
Suddenly the talks stumbled. The Netherlands, which has traditionally
maintained a currency parity with the D-Mark, signalled that it intended to
follow the Germans out of the ERM. It would not endanger the monetary
stability which flowed from the guilder's close link with the D-Mark.
The Dutch protest led to a stampede among the rich northern European
countries, with Luxembourg, Belgium and then Denmark indicating that they,
too, wanted to leave. 'Suddenly we were looking at France sitting all alone
in the ERM with Spain and Portugal,' said one source.
At this point, news came that Mr Balladur had cancelled his press
conference. The talks shifted to a widening of the fluctuation bands, with
Germany calling for France to shift from its narrow 2.25 per cent margin to
6 per cent.
According to a European monetary official, the Germans sweetened their 6 per
cent offer with an implicit cut in short-term interest rates - a promise
which had added credibility since Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, his deputy and successor-designate, were
present in the talks.
However, French officials turned down the offer on the grounds that it would
have amounted to a devaluation which again would have put France in a
'second tier' with Spain and Portugal. France also turned down an offer of a
10 per cent fluctuation band. 'They did not want the margin to be tested,'
said one official present at the talks.
Then the French counter-attacked. In one tense quadrilateral meeting between
Germany, France, and the Netherlands chaired by Belgium in its role as
president of the EC, the Dutch came under 'tremendous' pressure to break
their link with the Germans; but Mr Kok and Mr Wim Duisenberg, Dutch central
bank governor and front-runner to head the putative European central bank,
refused to buckle.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, also weighed in on behalf
of the Germans leaving the ERM and declaring that he was opposed to a
general flotation of currencies. The statement was not cleared with the rest
of the Commission, a senior EC official said.
The British, forced out of the ERM last September along with the Italians,
remained low-key throughout, despite earlier talks of an 'honest-broker'
role being played by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer. He
appears to have accepted advice that it could encourage a backlash from
Europeans frustrated that the British, after all, might have had a point
about 'fault-lines' within the ERM.
Finally, after numerous variations of wider bands involving various member
states, the solution was found: a fluctuation band of 15 per cent for all
currencies barring the D-Mark and guilder.
The aim was two-fold: to disguise a de facto French devaluation as well as
the de facto suspension of the system.
Grim ministerial faces early yesterday revealed the tensions of the previous
12 hours. They also pointed to the lack of unity within the Community,
summed up by the fact that the German-Dutch agreement to maintain parity was
not even included in the official communique.
The ERM had survived, but at a substantial price.

FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking Up The Pieces: Welcome flexibility,
goodbye simplicity - Life in the new system promises to be more complicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL its flaws and inflexibilities, the semi-fixed version of the
exchange rate mechanism, which Europe's leaders effectively abandoned last
weekend, had one great advantage: simplicity.
Europe's new dirty floating regime may, at last, be about to deliver cuts in
interest rates that France and most of its other ERM partners desperately
need.
But, after one day of practice with the new 'flexible ERM', it is already
apparent that life will continue to be economically complicated, as well as
politically difficult, for Europe's finance ministers.
Part of the new challenge of life after the hard ERM is technical: until
last weekend, those European countries with narrow ERM bands had no
effective power to pursue an independent monetary policy.
Now, with the freedom to appreciate and depreciate by as much as 15 per cent
either side of the old parities, national central banks have much more
discretion to cut interest rates below the Bundesbank's. The UK, for
example, has lowered interest rates well below those of the ERM countries
but would still have managed to remain within the system's new and gaping
bands.
This new freedom should bring welcome relief to Europe's troubled economies,
assuming that they take advantage of their bands and cut interest rates.
Indeed, the reason for the exchange pressure on France, Belgium and Denmark,
which effectively destroyed the ERM last Friday, was a belief in the markets
that these economies could not sustain Germany's high rates.
The right-hand chart above shows just how distorted the structure of
European real interest rates had become. Germany, battling with a persistent
public sector inflation problem, needs higher rates than low inflation
countries like France. But measured by inflation-adjusted real interest
rates this monetary squeeze was doubly severe.
The result is that countries in the 'soft core' of the loose ERM - Belgium,
Denmark and France - have real interest rates which are twice as high as
those in Germany.
The economic case for substantial cuts in French, Belgian and Danish
interest rates is therefore compelling. The depressed state of their
economies, low levels of inflation and falling producer prices all suggest
that the inflation risk from depreciation can be ignored for now.
In any case, the British experience of the past few months suggests that,
once the markets become used to the floating rate and convinced that lower
interest rates are delivering economic recovery, the exchange rate is at
least as likely to go up as to fall further.
Yet things may not be that simple. For the deal early on Monday morning did
not solve the economic and political problems that German unification has
bequeathed to Europe. It merely began a new, and maybe equally turbulent,
period of effectively floating, rather than effectively fixed, exchange
rates.
The hard ERM's collapse, and the publicly expressed desire of leading
governments to keep to the timetable of the Maastricht treaty and thus
return to narrow ERM bands by the beginning of next year, make the monetary
choices more complicated.
For if the French government is to avoid the charge that it has broken its
promise not to devalue and recapture the anti-inflationary credibility that
the hard ERM provided, then it must seek a return to narrow ERM bands as
soon as possible. But the further France cuts interest rates, the longer it
will have to wait for the Bundesbank to catch up and the further the
monetary union timetable will be delayed.
That may help explain why France did not cut rates yesterday, even though
the markets were previously selling the franc because French interest rates
were too high.
A second reason for concern is that the ERM's new flexibility might lead to
complaints about 'competitive devaluations' of the sort that France has
accused Britain, in particular, of engaging in over the past nine months.
This worry would be exacerbated if interest rates cuts and exchange rate
depreciation occurred in a relatively unco-ordinated fashion.
Might these worries about competitive devaluations make sense? The charts
above show the Financial Times's measure of price competitiveness in Europe,
based on nominal effective exchange rates which are then weighted by
European trade shares and adjusted for relative producer price inflation
rates.
In fact, the evidence suggests that France has already made substantial
gains in competitiveness over the past six years.
Yesterday's 3 per cent franc depreciation only goes part of the way to
recapturing the losses that France has suffered since sterling and the
Italian lira left the ERM last September. But if the franc fort policy was
about improving French price competitiveness, then it has already been a
success. The further the franc falls, the greater the gains.
The UK, by contrast, has not taken great advantage of floating exchange
rates to recapture its lost competitiveness. Sterling's appreciation of
recent months has not completely removed the gains made since last
September. But Britain's effective exchange rate, adjusted for the the UK's
relatively rapid wage inflation in the late 1980s, has actually appreciated
by 16 per cent since 1987 - a marked loss of competitiveness.
But it is German industry which stands to lose the most from a sizeable fall
in the value of the French franc over the next few months.
The chart shows that the inflation-adjusted D-Mark has already appreciated
by 5 per cent since last September. And the logic of the Bundesbank's high
interest rate policy, the German government's fiscal problems and the
softening of the ERM, all point to a further rise in the currency.
Whether Europe's governments will be able to live with the diff-erential
movements in interest rates and shifts in exchange rate competitiveness that
the new soft ERM implies could prove to be an equally severe test of their
ability to put collective concerns above national interests.
That Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, used a press conference
yesterday to point out that Europe's finance ministers and central bank
governors have agreed 'not to abuse monetary policy to acquire artificial
competitive advantages', is a worrying sign of tensions to come.

currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central banks of Belgium and Denmark took measures to arrest the fall of
their currencies against the D-Mark yesterday, possibly fearing sharp
outflows from their bond and equity markets after the widening of the
exchange rate mechanism's bands.
Most ERM countries appeared concerned yesterday that the new ERM regime
could lead to disorderly devaluations of their currencies, and left interest
rates unchanged.
But the Belgian authorities were concerned to hold their currency close to
its former ERM floor to the D-Mark, intervening in the market at the
BFr21.50 level against the German currency.
Denmark took even more drastic measures, raising one-month interest rates to
25 per cent, after the krone had fallen to DKr4.15 against the D-Mark from
the previous floor of DKr3.9016. Both Belgium and Denmark have reasons to be
more concerned than other countries about the prospect of a general exchange
rate float against the D-Mark.
Belgian equity and bond markets have benefited from international flows of
funds because of the close monetary and exchange rate relationship that the
Belgian franc has had with the D-Mark in recent years.
Now that this has been untied, investors may focus more closely on the
country's fundamental economic problems, including a huge public debt.
Denmark has a fundamentally stronger economic position than have many ERM
countries, with the lowest inflation in Europe and a trade surplus. But some
analysts believe the unravelling of the ERM may lead dealers to bracket
Denmark with Sweden and Finland, both of which have undertaken substantial
devaluations against the D-Mark in recent years.

FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Same rules but easier to
play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDENING the currency bands to 15 per cent for all except the D-Mark and the
guilder makes it much less demanding to be a member of the ERM. But the
basic rules of the system are otherwise the same.
It is a 'parity grid system', meaning each currency can only fluctuate a
certain amount from a fixed 'par value' with regard to every other member
currency. In the revamped mechanism, all the par values are unchanged, but
these rates will be a lot less relevant now that currencies can oscillate so
widely.
Before last weekend, a currency's maximum deviation from its par value was
only plus or minus 2.25 per cent, except for the Spanish peseta and the
Portuguese escudo, which could move 6 per cent either way.
With 15 per cent bands, a currency could be theoretically devalued by 30 per
cent - from its ceiling to its floor - against another member without
falling out of the system.
A look at the new floor and ceiling values for each member currency shows
the impact of the broader bands. The French franc can now fall as low as
FFr3.8948 against the D-Mark, or rise as high as FFr2.8881, before
endangering its position in the ERM grid. Until yesterday morning, the
franc's floor and ceiling against the D-Mark since 1987 had been FFr3.4305
and FFr3.2792, respectively.
According to the ERM's rules, whenever a currency is at its floor against
another member, the central banks of both countries have to intervene to
prevent the currency from falling out of the system.
In practice, the monetary authorities used to prop up a weak currency well
before then. Even so, many economists doubt that the situation will arise
very often while the wider fluctuation bands are in place.

FT  03 AUG 93 / Paris, Bonn say union on track: Governments struggle to
suppress monetary differences after exchange rate reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community governments struggled to suppress their economic and
monetary disagreements yesterday after allowing their currencies to
fluctuate widely in a bid to preserve a semblance of exchange rate
co-operation.
Despite differences over interest rate policy which brought on the currency
crisis, the French and German governments led a number of others in
insisting that the agreement by EC finance ministers early yesterday to
reform the rules of the Community's tattered exchange rate mechanism would
not derail plans for economic and monetary union.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said the next stage of European
monetary union would start on schedule next January despite the decision to
create fluctuation margins of 15 per cent either way for the eight ERM
currencies - with the exception of the D-Mark-Dutch guilder link.
'The temporary widening of bands may appear to be a setback with regard to
the high degree of exchange rate stability we are striving for,' he said at
a joint press conference with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president.
'But on the other hand it increases the credibility of the system. The
Community must remain a zone of monetary stability in the future.'
However, Mr Schlesinger warned that the degree of currency fluctuations
would depend on the actions of EC governments, particularly on interest
rates. 'The policy of participating countries will, in my view, continue to
be geared to keeping the actual swings in exchange rates narrow,' he said.
'The more carefully individual countries use their possible scope for
interest rate cuts, the more careful and more moderate the changes in
exchange rates will be.'
As the French franc and several other currencies came under fresh pressure
within their newly widened ERM bands yesterday, a number of EC governments
and central banks indicated divergent priorities. Tensions remained evident
between France and Germany in particular over interest rate policy, with Mr
Schlesinger again refusing to bow to pressure from Germany's EC partners for
an early cut in German rates and reiterating his scepticism over progress
towards Emu.
Senior officials in Brussels and other capitals conceded that yesterday's
compromise in Brussels had loosened the constraints of the European Monetary
System to a point not far short of allowing all EC currencies to float. 'It
is marginally better than floating,' said one Brussels official.
Adding to the impression of disarray, the founding fathers of the EMS,
former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former West German
chancellor Helmut Schmidt, issued a joint statement saying the agreement was
tantamount to suspending the EMS. 'This solution may offer some practical
advantage only if it remains an adjustment phase of limited duration,' they
said. 'We ask that this suspension be provisional and that normal
functioning of the EMS resume as rapidly as possible.'
In Paris, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, explicitly blamed high
German interest rates for the crisis that ended the strong link between the
French franc and the D-Mark. But he put a brave face on the weekend
compromise, saying it had prevented a devaluation of the franc and ensured
the survival of the ERM. 'The European Monetary System remains in working
order with a considerable loosening, but its founding principles remain in
effect,' Mr Balladur said.
The prime minister said he had favoured a temporary withdrawal of the D-Mark
from the ERM to ease the strains on the currency system, but had agreed to a
widening of the fluctuation bands to preserve the process of European
integration. By contrast Mr Waigel said there had been no suggestion at the
EC meeting that Germany should leave the EMS.
At his Bonn press conference, Mr Waigel gave a strong hint that he expected
further interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank after the results achieved in
Brussels. 'With these decisions, the Bundesbank can continue its policy of
step-by-step interest reductions without pressure from outside,' he said.
However, Mr Schlesinger, who said the Bundesbank had had to cope with
speculative inflows of some DM60bn (Pounds 23.5bn) in July - nearly half of
this last Friday as the franc came under renewed pressure - said he could
not forecast what the bank might do.
Casting doubts on progress towards Emu, he said: 'We have to consider to
what extent convergence exists in the EMS. As far as Germany is concerned,
it doesn't'

FT  03 AUG 93 / Investors look to test limits of franc and krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc and the Danish krone came under strong selling pressure
yesterday, casting doubt about how quickly the relaxation of the European
exchange rate mechanism would allow these countries to reduce interest
rates.
The stretching of both currencies' lower limits in the ERM encouraged
investors to test how far they could push down the value of these currencies
against the D-Mark.
At one stage yesterday, the franc was being sold 3.4 per cent below its
former ERM floor against the D-Mark, while the krone initially fell more
than 6 per cent.
Both currencies later recovered some of the lost ground, but dealers said
this had only occurred because Denmark had raised a key borrowing rate to 25
per cent while France left its official interest rates unchanged.
In further developments arising from the decision early yesterday to make
the ERM more flexible by widening its fluctuation bands, Portugal, Denmark,
and Belgium all indicated their reservations about giving all currencies
except the Dutch guilder a 15 per cent margin of movement around the D-Mark.
This replaced existing bands of 6 per cent or 2.25 per cent.
As the Belgian franc, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo also lost ground
against the D-Mark, the German currency and the Bundesbank emerged as the
main beneficiaries of the agreement hammered out in Brussels to revamp the
ERM to increase confidence in it by international investors.
The accord reduces the obligations on the Bundesbank to buy weak currencies
in costly intervention operations. The central bank has also been spared
having to compromise its record on monetary management by promising
interest-rate reductions.
The introduction of extremely wide currency bands has been interpreted as
essentially allowing the system's currencies to float while preserving the
appearance of a managed exchange-rate system.
Foreign exchange trading was uneven as investors weighed up the implications
of the new-look ERM, devised in nearly 12 hours of crisis talks by European
Community finance ministers after the substantial selling at the end of last
week of the fragile ERM currencies.
The D-Mark appreciated more than 3 pfennigs against the dollar to stand at
DM 1.709 in late New York trading as dealers took the view that Germany was
unlikely to cut interest rates in the near future. The weaker dollar was
also trading early in the US at a post-war low against the yen of Y104.05,
but recovered slightly late in the day.
Sterling, which had risen against many other currencies strongly in recent
weeks, fell 3 pfennigs on the day to close in London at DM2.555. It gained
only slightly in New York, as dealers speculated that the UK could cut base
rates from 6 per cent.
At the start of European trading, the French franc came under strong selling
pressure. It fell as low as FFr3.55 against the D-Mark, well below its old
floor of FFr3.4305, but recovered to close in London at FFr3.505, some 8 1/2
centimes down on the day, with little change in New York or in early Far
East trading.
The Danish krone suffered a more substantial fall, dropping by about 6 per
cent against the German currency at one stage, and forcing the Danish
authorities to raise their one-month interest rates to 25 per cent. The
currency later appreciated to a London close of DKr4.0367.
Dealers sold the currency amid fears that the unravelling of the ERM would
place the krone in the same category as currencies such as the Swedish krona
and Finnish markka, both of which have suffered substantial devaluations in
the last year.
The Belgian franc also came under pressure, dropping well below its former
floor against the D-Mark of BFr21.09 and bottoming out at BFr21.55. Both the
peseta and escudo were also sold, the latter falling below its former ERM
floor against the D-Mark of Es105.04 for the first time.
Expressions of dissatisfaction with the patched-up ERM were led by Mr Miguel
Beleza, governor of Portugal's central bank, who said the escudo's
fluctuation band did not need widening, but accepted this solution as the
least of many evils.
Criticism also came from Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor,
who said: 'Denmark is not a supporter of the new system. We are
disappointed.'

FT  03 AUG 93 / Government backs down on plans for school testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday signalled a full-scale retreat on education policy,
announcing a reversal of its plans for testing, the publication of school
league tables and the content of the national curriculum.
The changes, which follow a report by Sir Ron Dearing - appointed by Mr John
Patten, education secretary, in April to review the curriculum - appear
likely to bring an end to the boycotts by teachers' unions which wrecked
tests for seven-year-olds and 14-year-olds this year.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister who responded to the Dearing report
on behalf of Mr Patten, who is ill, announced that league tables of school
performance based on tests for seven-year-olds and 14-year-olds, planned to
start this year, will be abandoned. Teachers' unions had lobbied heavily for
this change, which was not in Sir Ron's recommendations.
The government plans to publish league tables for tests taken by
11-year-olds, which will not start on a compulsory basis until 1995 at the
earliest.
Other climbdowns included restricting compulsory tests to the three core
subjects of English, mathematics and science - it had been planned to
introduce them across the full range of 10 national curriculum subjects -
and raising teachers' assessments to equal status with the tests.
Sir Ron proposed that the curriculum should be slimmed down so that it only
took up 75 per cent of classroom time for 14-year-olds.
In a surprising step, Sir Ron also announced that he will consult employers
and teachers on introducing new vocational courses for 14-year-olds.
Baroness Blatch denied that the move was a government climbdown. She said:
'The early architects of the system built into the system too much
bureaucracy, too much convolution and that has been substantially addressed
by Sir Ron.'
The three teachers' unions which are boycotting the tests all cautiously
welcomed the news. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers is to ballot
its members in the new term, while the National Association of Schoolmasters
Union of Women Teachers said its boycott would be lifted once the reductions
in workload took effect. Mr Doug McAvoy of the National Union of Teachers
said his union's boycott would continue at least until its national
executive has met to discuss the issue.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the news as 'a
significant blow to the government's original position' and called for Mr
Patten's resignation. She said Pounds 35m had been wasted on attempting to
introduce tests this year.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oji Paper, one of Japan's two biggest paper makers, is divesting production
of certain quality coated papers to meet monopolies requirements ahead of
its planned merger in October with Kanzaki Paper, which ranks seventh in the
industry, writes Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
Oji said it was transferring production facilities and marketing rights for
two types of specialist paper, used for magazine and book covers, to Chuetsu
Pulp and Paper, in which Oji is the biggest shareholder with 7.6 per cent.
A final sale to Chuetsu, the 12th biggest paper maker, would take place
after three or four years.
The shuffling of assets forms part of a consolidation in the industry
brought on by overcapacity, which has triggered a spate of mergers.
In April, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp united to become Nippon Paper
Industries, with which the Oji-Kanzaki combine will vie for top slot.

FT  02 AUG 93 / 'The Big Hustle' goes for gold in the 1996 Olympics: Atlanta
is confident it is equal to the daunting task of staging the games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE extravaganza of the summer Olympics usually takes place in well-known
cities, such as Barcelona, Seoul, Los Angeles, and Moscow, to name the last
four. But in 1996 Atlanta, the ninth largest US city, will host the games
and it sees the event as its ticket to international recognition.
Atlantans intend the games to bring not only world fame, but foreign
investment and a physical transformation of the city. If these seem
ambitious goals, take into account that the best-known characteristic of
this city, sometimes derogatorily called 'The Big Hustle', is
self-promotion.
But after lengthy self-congratulation following its award of the games in
1990, Atlanta now seems awestruck by the scope of what it must accomplish to
mount the 16-day spectacle. Nonetheless, Mr Billy Payne, the irrepressibly
exuberant Atlanta lawyer and native son who heads the private organising
committee called the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (Acog), is
brimming with confidence. Atlanta will stage the games, he says, 'better
than anyone ever has.'
With respect to his committee's budget needs of Dollars 1.5bn, Mr Payne's
confidence seems well founded. The US television rights for the Atlanta
games were sold on July 27 to NBC for a record Dollars 456m. The final bid
by the network came in unexpectedly high given that it recorded a loss of
Dollars 100m on the Barcelona Olympics, for which it had paid Dollars 401m.
But with projections that this will be the largest audience in history for
any Olympics, NBC officials appear confident that they can make a profit.
Although Mr Payne had once predicted he could get Dollars 600m in TV rights,
he said he was pleased with the agreement. Of the Dollars 456m fee, 60 per
cent, or Dollars 274m, will go to Acog, with the remainder to the
International Olympic Committee.
Atlanta, the American South's business capital, is only the second city in
history - after Los Angeles in 1984 - to raise funds for the games entirely
from the private sector. After television rights, the next biggest
contributor to Acog's budget is corporate sponsorships. Unlike Los Angeles,
which sold some 35 at about Dollars 4m each, Acog wants 10-12 sponsors at
Dollars 40m a piece.
Surprisingly, in an economic climate that can hardly be called robust, five
companies have already signed on for the full Dollars 40m, namely
Nationsbank, Home Depot, Sara Lee, IBM, and Anheuser-Busch. John Hancock
Financial Services has also signed on to promote its life insurance, but two
other insurers are expected to fill the insurance category for a total of
more than Dollars 40m, according to Mr Payne.
He says several companies will share the telecommunications category and
also bring in more than the normal sponsor fee. He claims negotiations with
sponsors for cars and quick service restaurants are in the final details.
Chrysler and McDonald's have been past sponsors of the US Olympic Committee,
which has combined efforts with Acog for 1996 and will take 30 per cent of
the sponsor fees.
Yet, while ACOG's financial picture 'looks extraordinarily favourable,'
according to Mr Payne, the bigger picture for Atlanta is not so rosy.
There are worries that Atlanta will not measure up to world standards on
amenities. Although it does not have to build infrastructure, its downtown
has little life for pedestrians and virtually closes after business hours.
Visitors may also shudder at the poverty of the dilapidated neighbourhoods
where the main Olympic venues will be located.
A Dollars 500m facelift is planned that includes walkways and parks. This is
down from an original wish list of Dollars 2.5bn, but beyond a request to
the state for Dollars 200m, and it is unclear where the rest of the money
will come from. The city has pledged not to put itself in debt for the
Olympics.
City improvements are the financial responsibility of local government. But
Acog, which is handling Olympic venues, has been caught up in conflicts
about the impact on the predominantly black neighbourhoods where its venues
will be.
Acog's construction of a Dollars 209m Olympic stadium, which will be the
city's centrepiece for 1996, is, for example, opposed by residents who
contend it will not deliver the promised economic development.
Meanwhile, true to the city's reputation for being pushy, the business
community has latched on to the Olympics as a chance to win new investment.
By the end of this month, the Chamber of Commerce will launch a three-year
worldwide TV advertising campaign on CNN International to promote the city.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Microsoft faces new investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE anti-trust division of the US Justice Department is to review documents
relating to the business practices of Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, following the failure of the Federal Trade
Commission to agree on the case after a three-and-a-half year investigation.
The move represents a setback for Microsoft because it had appeared that the
FTC was hopelessly deadlocked on the issue and that the investigation might
soon end. The company declined to comment, saying that it has not been
officially notified of the review.
The review also moves the issue into the political arena and could test the
Clinton administration's tougher stance on anti-trust enforcement. If the
Justice Department finds evidence of anti-competitive activity, it will have
to decide whether the public interest is served by taking action against one
of the most successful high-technology companies in the US.
The Justice Department will review the thousands of documents amassed by the
FTC. The commission has reached deadlock twice this year on whether to
proceed against the software company, with the latest vote taken last month.
Two commissioners voted in favour and two against issuing a complaint. A
fifth commissioner excused himself from the case, claiming a conflict of
interests.
Microsoft's competitors allege that the company has attempted to raise false
concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly
with operating system programs sold by competitors. There are also
complaints that Microsoft's program-licensing methods are designed to
exclude competitors.
Microsoft, which has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, last week accused
rival Novell, a leading supplier of software for PC networks, of attempting
to stir up trouble for its own benefit. Throughout the FTC investigation
'nothing has come up that causes us the slightest concern,' said Mr Bill
Gates, Microsoft chairman.
'The only issues that seem to be active . . . have been promoted very
heavily by Novell,' he said. 'We're disappointed by the way that Novell is
pursuing this.' Novell's goal, he charged 'is to get us to raise our prices
. . . so that they can compete more effectively.'
Novell, which has actively lobbied for anti-trust action against Microsoft,
said that it had been contacted by the FTC and co-operated with the
investigation.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Monday Interview: Cause of southern discomfort - Umberto
Bossi, leader of Italy's Lombard League, speaks to Robert Graham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Punctuality, wrote Oscar Wilde, is the thief of time.
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's populist Lombard League, seems to have
taken this dictum to heart. In a country where punctuality is usually
honoured in the breach, Mr Bossi is supremely unpunctual.
Does this reflect his belief that he can set his own agenda or does he
become so deeply involved in issues and people that he loses track of time?
It is probably a mix of both. His aides despair of trying to organise his
schedule; but they are fiercely loyal, attracted by his energy and boundless
confidence in his self-appointed mission to change Italy.
As the interview begins - one and a half hours late - he tosses a police
summons contemptuously into the waste paper basket. Hasn't he been warned
that he faces prosecution for insulting the head of state, President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro. 'I don't care,' he says.
Mr Bossi can afford to be cavalier. He is the sole genuinely new leader to
emerge in Italy at a crucial moment of political transition; and, unlike the
discredited political class whose hegemony he is challenging, he owes
favours to nobody. The League, founded in 1984 as a regional autonomy
movement for Lombardy, is virtually his invention.
'First we set out to conquer the north . . . and look where we are now,' he
says in his gravelly voice. 'Then we take over the south, and finally we
march on Rome - like Garibaldi. It will be difficult; but we have begun to
work on the south.'
This may seem wishful thinking. But in the space of three years, the
51-year-old politician from Varese has propelled the League from an obscure
regional grouping to a party that controls 40 per cent of the vote in the
rich northern industrial belt of Italy. The Lombard League itself has
spawned federations in neighbouring Piedmont, the Veneto, Liguria and Emilia
Romagna.
The League now controls the administrations of a string of northern towns,
including Milan, the capital. It has 80 seats in parliament, and Mr Bossi
himself at the April 1992 general election received 239,000 votes - more
than any other deputy.
'We are not separatists but federalists,' he says. In the past six months,
Mr Bossi has toned down his talk of separatism. But when separatist language
does slip into public speeches this is Mr Bossi talking from the heart.
A hard core of League supporters embraces the idea of separatism. But Mr
Bossi knows that the 'honest voters' he needs to swell his ranks want to
hear a more sober message touching on practical concerns of the day.
'The north is against centralised control of the state, against statism,' he
says. 'We strongly support privatisation. Here in the north people work
hard, they produce things; there are thousands of small- and medium-sized
industries. This is one of the most advanced regions of Europe. Our
development cannot be held back by paying taxes to support the south.
'We are not anti-south; but we are against the way the south has been
enslaved by the Christian Democrats and allowed to live off state
hand-outs.'
In other words, national resources have to be better and more fairly used.
At a time of serious recession, the north wants to see more of its tax money
ploughed back into job creation and infrastructure in the region. If not, Mr
Bossi raises the threat of separatism, but less stridently now than a year
ago.
Mr Bossi has learned fast to be a national figure and has tempered his crude
vocabulary and use of Lumbard dialect. Yet his conversation is still
peppered with hyperbole and dogmatic assertion about the inevitable collapse
of a corrupt ancien regime.
'The system is imploding under its own weight. . . .The roof of the building
has been falling in, the walls are crumbling. We have 4.5m people receiving
fake disability pensions. We have allowed the national debt to pile up
without cover. It can't go on.'
In one of his many brushes with the establishment, Mr Bossi encouraged his
supporters not to buy treasury bills. But he now back-tracks, a recognition
of the fact that his vote is made up of small traders and businessmen,
worried savers and pensioners - just the kind of people who put their
savings in low taxed treasury bills.
'I didn't actually tell people not to buy treasury bills. I was saying that
people here do not want to see their savings going towards propping up the
regime's wasteful spending: public borrowing should go towards supporting
productive investment. And if it doesn't do this voters should draw their
own conclusions.'
The same view applies to his controversial threat to institute a campaign of
non-payment of taxes. This touches all the right visceral chords of his
League supporters. 'When Rome is run by a bunch of robbers how can you
expect people in the north to pay taxes?'
Significantly, with Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the Bank of
Italy, now prime minister and a man long seen as guarantor of the small
saver, Mr Bossi is less strident on this issue.
However he has not mellowed his tone or changed his stance in his opposition
to corrupt local administration and national government. 'Only the League
and the magistrates (investigating the corruption scandals of illicit party
financing) have responded to the will for change. Together they are filling
the political vacuum.'
The League has been the main political beneficiary of the magistrates'
investigations that are laying bare the depths of the traditional parties'
corruption. Not surprisingly Mr Bossi opposes any curb on the magistrates'
powers. 'The magistrates cannot be stopped. The revolution must be allowed
to go on until it loses its own momentum.
'Fresh elections are the only means of ending Tagentopoli (the corruption
scandals). We must go to the polls as soon as possible.' The present
legislature, with one in six parliamentarians under investigation, has no
legitimacy, he adds.
Despite having been vociferous in demanding elections this autumn, he is now
less dogmatic. 'The longer we are kept waiting, the more our support grows,'
he says. The sooner elections are held, the less time his opponents will
have to recover their disarray and form new alliances.
Mr Bossi is disdainful of alliances. Most of the time, all the political
parties - of every colour - are ranged against the League. 'We don't mind:
people can see the rest are intent on holding up change.'
Such determination to go it alone is perhaps rooted in his tough origins.
League literature describes him as the son of a 'Catholic worker' father and
a mother of 'small-holder origins'. His origins are similar to many of his
generation: the first to enjoy higher education and benefit from industrial
modernisation in the north.
Mr Bossi failed to complete his medical degree at Pavia university and
League literature draws a discreet veil over his career until entering
politics in 1979. 'Over the next decade I drove more than 1.3m kilometres. I
never stopped.' It is no wonder that two years ago he had mild heart trouble
with doctors ordering him to reduce his heavy smoking.
His success has been based on his own political nose and his homegrown way
of putting across simple ideas to an electorate used to intrigue and corrupt
political masters.
'The League does not believe in ideology as such. We do not say there will
be an earthly paradise (like the marxists) or that people are all good (like
the Catholic parties). We recognise that people want to see a little more
money in their pockets, live in a more modern state: a state that functions
better and where the rule of law is observed.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / Return of the pessimists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We don't hear so much nowadays about the New World Order. After the fall of
the Berlin Wall, you could hardly turn a page without stumbling over some
novel prescription for perfect peace. If it was not The End of History, it
was the model of the Solitary Superpower. And if it was not collective
security in a pan-European confederation, it was the coming-of-age of the UN
and emerging world government.
The utopians have mostly fallen silent now, because their recipes have
curdled. Whatever Francis Fukuyama thought he meant, History continues to
plague us in all of its familiar dimensions; and however glad we may be to
see the back of the Old Order, the new world is characterised by a degree of
disorder which far exceeds the capacity of our existing institutions to
contain it.
At the time, the Gulf war was a heartening exploit of UN solidarity and
American military leadership; with hindsight, it does not look so good. Only
six months ago, the second Start agreement seemed a historic move to put the
genie of nuclear holocaust back in the bottle; today it is re-emerging in
Ukraine, Pakistan, North Korea and even, conceivably, Japan. And then there
is Bosnia; even an agreement in Geneva would only mark a new phase of that
particular nightmare.
Pessimists always expected things to go wrong; and policy analysts always
emphasise the down-side. Otherwise they have nothing to sell. Sooner or
later, one of the pessimistic policy analysts was bound to come along with a
counter-theory, to explain why things will be just as bad as before, but for
different reasons.
Samuel Huntington is professor of the Science of Government at Harvard. And
his theory is that global politics will in future be dominated by the clash
of civilisations. 'The fault lines between civilisations,' he says, 'will be
the battle lines of the future.'* That, is just the kind of sentence you
would expect from a pessimistic policy-analyst.
Mr Huntington identifies seven or eight large civilisations: Western,
Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and
possibly African. And he suggests that the deep-seated differences between
these civilisations may also become battle lines in future. The world is
getting more crowded: so people fall back on kith and kin. Economic
modernisation weakens the nation state, so religion moves in to fill the
gap. But economic modernisation also builds up regional economic
integration. Finally, the power of the West, now at an all-time peak,
provokes the other civilisations to return to their cultural roots.
Central to the Huntington hypothesis is the idea that these civilisations
will be not just distinct but antagonistic. And the future, according to Mr
Huntington, will be defined by relations between the West and the Rest.
These relations will be essentially conflictual, because there cannot be a
world civilisation of universal values transcending cultural differences.
'Western ideas of individualism, liberalism, constitutionalism, human
rights, equality, liberty, the rule of law, democracy, free markets,' he
says, 'often have little resonance in Islamic, Confucian, Japanese, Hindu,
Buddhist or Orthodox cultures.' In particular, there is a deep-seated
antagonism over political and human rights values.
The West is now 'at an extraordinary peak of power', according to Mr
Huntington. As a result, the strategic postures of other civilisations will
be defined by their attitudes to the West; and they have three broad
options. They can choose isolation, like Burma and North Korea; they can try
to join the West, like Mexico; or they can modernise while seeking allies
against the West, like the countries of South East Asia. But the most likely
prospect, according to Huntington, will be conflict between the West and
several Islamic-Confucian states.
To meet this threat, the West needs to promote greater solidarity within its
own civilisation, especially between Europe and North America; to co-opt
related cultures in Eastern Europe and Latin America; and to co-operate with
Russia and Japan. It must also maintain its economic and military power to
protect its interests.
The problem with the Huntington thesis, is that he does not provide
convincing arguments for expecting the age-old antagonisms between
civilisations to get much worse in future. The rise of fundamentalism in
India and the world of Islam, or the growth of regional trading arrangements
around the world, do not seem adequate reasons.
On the other hand, there is one development which could easily cause
antagonism between civilisations to degenerate into conflict, and that would
be a serious shift in power relationships between them. Mr Huntington
asserts the West is at a peak of its power, as if this were a peak on which
it could expect to remain. But it is more likely that Western power is
really at a high water-mark, shortly before the tide starts to ebb.
Fifty years ago, the US totally dominated the world economy. It is now
rivalled by Europe and Japan. In a generation it could be challenged by
China. Europe is a partner in the Western civilisation. Japan professes an
uneasy associate membership of the West. But China will always be another
civilisation. For hundreds of years the West has dominated the world
economy, because it controlled technology and dictated the terms of trade.
In future, technology will be more equally accessible, and others will start
determining terms of trade. It is this which will bring the clash of
civilisations.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Adult European partner wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of the franc is more than a matter of French pride. It is the
essential test of European monetary co-operation, and will determine the
fate of European Monetary Union.
Few European politicians of stature have questioned these propositions in
the currency turmoil of the past nine months. Still fewer have queried the
assumptions behind EMU.
Now, in the moment of supreme crisis, many are predicting the collapse of
the Exchange Rate Mechanism, with dire consequences for European political
and economic integration.
A paper on US-European Community relations by the Carnegie Endowment
Institute for International Peace offers a more balanced picture of the EC's
future. Whatever the disadvantages of distance from daily events, the
authors have produced constructive proposals which are a welcome change from
'all-or-nothing' mentality gripping many European policy-makers.
Mr Robert Zoellick, a former aide to Mr James Baker while he was US
secretary of state, chaired the study. His premise is Americans should not
magnify the EC's problems, but should instead pursue America's 'strategic
interest' in having an outward-looking, internationalist EC as an adult
partner on the world stage.
Mr Zoellick writes: 'The emergence of new economic and political obstacles
should not be misperceived as a European rejection of the fundamental
commitment to overcoming a destructive legacy through closer integration.
European integration will proceed - albeit in fits and starts - although its
exact course is still an open question.'
The study's main proposal is the creation of a 'transatlantic single
market'. That sounds like a cute re-working of European Commission President
Jacques Delors' 1992 project to create a single European market covering the
free movement of goods, services, capital and people. But the group is more
intent on drawing up new rules to defuse trade rivalries and head off the
subsidy wars which currently plague the agricultural, textile and steel
industries.
Other ideas include a protocol on foreign investment, reaffirming 'national
treatment' for European and US firms operating in their respective foreign
markets; closer co-operation on industrial and environmental policies; and
new rules providing for more predictable tax policy.
The implicit message in the paper is that Clinton should take a more
activist approach to the EC's development. No historical parallels are
perfect, but Mr Zoellick's inspiration may well be the Truman
administration's policy of encouraging European integration after World War
II. By any measure, it was a success, leading to a liberal order built
around the Gatt-Bretton Woods trading system.
The cold war's end has raised questions about the future of the old order.
Mr Zoellick wants Clinton to shape the new by strengthening existing
institutions, of which the EC is one of the strongest.
There is, however, a sting in the tail. Mr Zoellick says the US should be
'increasingly discriminate about the content, form and resulting outlook of
the EC'; he suggests the US Treasury be involved in unfolding European
Monetary Union, 'if (the US) wants to avoid unpleasant surprises'.
Some in Brussels will complain this is a demand for a '13th seat' at the EC
table. The US commerce department tried a similar ruse early in the Bush
administration, but were shown the door. Mr Zoellick's sweetener - more
involvement for the EC in international councils such as the Group of Seven
industrialised nations - will not dispel the impression the US wants to slip
a Trojan horse into Europe.
From Brussels's vantage, the most refreshing aspect of the paper is that it
takes European aspirations for closer integration seriously. This should
silence those in Europe who believe the US is part of an Anglo-Saxon plot to
sabotage EMU, a notion which gained currency in the second battle for the
franc last February.
Yet it remains true that many Americans find the European attachment to the
Exchange Rate Mechanism and the convergence criteria on inflation, budget
deficits and government debt baffling. They find it incomprehensible that
Europeans are willing to suffer high unemployment for the questionable prize
of fixed exchange rates.
This was the message behind last week's call by six leading economists at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for France to lead the way in the
abandonment of the ERM. The Six Wise Men argued in the FT that Europe is
repeating the mistake of the 1930s, when countries tried to hang on to the
gold standard at any price.
The response in Brussels is unchanged. Mr Delors has argued that maintaining
franc-D-Mark parity aims to avoid the mistakes of the 1930s, when Europe
fell victim to competitive devaluations.
The last 12 months have shown that the franc-mark parity is less about
economics and more about politics. It may be the men from MIT have
overestimated the Bundesbank's power to set the EC's political course. Final
judgment will rest on the response in Paris and Bonn.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Crisis continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER last Friday's unprecedented turmoil in the European exchange rate
mechanism, dealers were still waiting last night to see whether the
Bundesbank and the Bank of France would realign the currency grid or suspend
the system, writes James Blitz.
At the end of trading on Friday night, three currencies, the French and
Belgian francs and the Danish krone were at, or slightly above, their floors
against the D-Mark in the ERM. Both the French and German central banks had
intervened heavily in support of the French franc, possibly to the tune of
DM50bn.
Yesterday, dealers in London were wondering how they would respond in the
event of various outcomes to the crisis.
In the event that the system is suspended, the French franc could come under
some more selling pressure. But Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist
at UBS, said that the franc could rebound above its notional ERM floor
against the D-Mark because France's fundamental economic position is so
strong.
A strong alternative to suspension was that the bands for the franc and
Danish krone could be widened, perhaps to 6 per cent, allowing the franc to
drop further while maintaining its central parity.
But Mr Ian Harnett, an economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said
this would have to be accompanied by German interest rate cuts which would
then allow France to ease monetary policy. If that did not happen, the
market could try to test the new floor for the French franc and other
currencies in the near future.
Dealers will keep a close watch on the dollar/D-Mark level. The threatened
disintegration of the ERM may depress the D-Mark because the system has been
the cause of so much investment in the German currency.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Economics: Depressed indicators from Germany bring more bad
publicity for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE important German employment and output figures due out this week will be
viewed in a subdued light after the weekend's developments in the ERM.
West German unemployment is forecast to rise by 30,000, a little more than
the previous month's 29,000. The outlook for employment is similarly bleak:
it is expected to fall by a further 38,000, following the June fall of
35,000.
German industrial production and manufacturing output are both expected to
have been flat in June, after rises of 1.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent
respectively over the previous month. Manufacturing orders, predicted to
fall 1 per cent, would have deteriorated even further from the May figure,
which rose 3.8 per cent.
Overall, another dose of depressed figures from the German economy will only
add to the theorising about the future for European exchange rates which has
followed in the wake of the Bundesbank's decision not to cut the discount
rate at last week's council meeting.
It is a busy week for figures in the US. Observers will be especially
watching the July figure for non-farm payrolls after last month's meagre
13,000 rise. Forecasters expect a rebound in July, with an increase of
150,000. But considering the measure's erratic behaviour in recent years
(see graph), nothing should be taken for granted.
Other US data out this week - manufacturing payrolls, hourly earnings and
the newest unemployment rate - will help to provide a more balanced view of
the state of the US labour market. Unusually low employment growth has so
far been a stubborn feature of the American economy's recovery. As a result,
fewer economists now consider manufacturing payroll figures, for example, to
be a reliable guide to the level of overall economic activity.
The following are some of the week's other economic highlights and events.
The figures in brackets are the median of economists forecasts from MMS
International, a financial information company.
Today: US, July NAPM (48.5 per cent); June construction spending (up 0.5 per
cent). Japan, July car sales; first 20 days of the July trade balance; July

rescheduled from June 25. Germany, German Bond consortium meets in Frankfurt
to set the terms of a new Federal Bund issue. US, June leading indicators
(up 0.3 per cent), Johnson Redbook week ended July 31. Australia, Reserve
Bank of Australia monthly board meeting.
Wednesday: US, Fed releases Tan Book for August 17 FOMC meeting; June home
completions; car sales July 21-31 (7.0m units); truck sales for July 21-31.
Canada, July foreign reserves (up C300m).

RESULTS DUE
BOTH Royal Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum report their second quarter
results on Thursday. Shell is expected to show a healthy rise in current
cost net income from Pounds 516m to about Pounds 760m.
Results will have benefited from a weaker pound, stronger natural gas prices
in the US, cost-cutting and solid performances from non-OECD countries. The
biggest question now hangs over the dividend payment, which will not be
announced until September 18.
This time last year BP announced a dividend cut and Pounds 835m of post-tax
exceptional restructuring provisions. For the latest quarter, analysts are
looking for replacement cost net income of Pounds 240m with a dividend of
2.1p.
Abbey National is expected to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 315m
after bad debt provisions of some Pounds 160m when it reports its interim
results today. It is expected to be hit by provisions on French operations,
but show strong mortgage lending in the first half.
Tomorrow National Westminster is expected to show profits in the range of
Pounds 280m-Pounds 350m with a strong performance anticipated from treasury
and capital markets. The bank is likely to cover its interim dividend for
the first time since 1989.
Midland, whose parent bank HSBC Holdings reports on August 31, is expected
to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 200m on Wednesday, while
Barclays on Thursday is expected to show recovery from losses last year to
pre-tax profit of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 170m.
The interims from Reed Elsevier, the international publishing and
information group on Thursday are the first combined results since the
merger of Reed International and the Dutch publishers Elsevier took effect
at the beginning of the year. That and a change of year end appears to have
made City analysts wary of issuing firm forecasts but James Capel is looking
for combined pre-tax profits of Pounds 287m compared with Pounds 247m last
year.
GKN's interim results, to be announced on Wednesday, are expected to reflect
at least partly the very tough times now being experienced in the
Continental motor industry, where vehicle markets have plunged by up to one
third this year. But analysts don't expect too sharp a fall-off from last
year's Pounds 65.1m pre-tax, thanks to a continuing effective onslaught on
costs, still buoyant UK production and increasing market share for key
products like constant velocity joints.
The following day TI, the specialist engineering group, is expected to
report interim profits of a little more than Pounds 60m. The market will be
concentrating on the recently announced Dowty aerospace division's new
venture with Messier-Bugatti of France and Dowty's overall performance in a
difficult market.

FT  02 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries soar on poor GDP data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and a central banker who
places a lot of faith in close analysis of economic statistics and
forecasting, was left with egg on his face last week. To the delight of
Treasury investors, the second-quarter gross domestic product report came in
well below market forecasts.
News of the 1.6 per cent growth in second-quarter GDP sent bond prices
soaring, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue back down to near 6.5
per cent, its all-time low. Analysts had been expecting growth of around 2.2
per cent, while Mr Greenspan, who should know about these things, told
Congress just over a week ago that GDP would advance by nearer 2.5 per cent
in the April-to-June period.
Those comments, plus some heavy-handed remarks about inflation and the
possibility the Fed will have to put up interest rates to stem rising
prices, had been taken to heart by the bond market, which was confronted
with the unwelcome prospect of rising economic growth, rising inflation and
rising interest rates.
After the declines of that week, this latest bond market rally came as a
pleasant surprise, not least for equity markets investors, who several days
ago were fearful interest rates may have bottomed.
A variety of explanations have been offered as to why Wall Street's best
economists, the Fed chairman, and everyone else for that matter, got the GDP
numbers wrong. The most convincing of these concerns inventories.
During the first quarter, when growth was extremely weak, companies piled up
their inventories in the absence of strong consumer demand. When demand
revived in the second quarter (consumer spending rose a healthy 3.8 per cent
between April and June), rather than boost production, manufacturers ran
down their stockpiles of goods. Clearly, analysts missed the inventory
situation, which is why their forecasts were so awry.
If the slowdown of inventory accumulation adequately explains the
surprisingly poor rate of growth in the second quarter, then by the same
theory, the pace of economic activity in the next three to six months should
pick up handily as manufacturers step up production to keep demand
satisfied.
This prospect, however, does not seem to worry Treasury investors, who
concentrated on the headline GDP number. Combined with the even weaker
first-quarter figures, the economy grew at a meagre 1.2 per cent rate in the
first half of 1993, a sharp slowdown from the 4.1 per cent growth rate
achieved in the final six months of 1992.
And, as Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette points out in its latest credit market
circular: 'It is even more disappointing and somewhat worrisome that the
growth rate in the first half of 1993 was a full percentage point lower than
the growth rate of the economy during the first half of 1992.'
The first half of 1992 came not long after the economy had pulled out of
recession, so everyone expected growth to be weak back then. That the latest
growth rates cannot match the performance of a year ago suggests the economy
is in a poorer state than many imagine. All of this is good news for bonds.
The Treasury market is receiving an additional boost from overseas, namely
the turmoil in the currency markets. As the European exchange rate
mechanism, and with it the entire European Monetary System, teetered close
to collapse, international investors fled volatile European currencies for
dollar assets such as government securities.
There was, however, at least one factor against US bond prices last week -
the Bundesbank's decision not to lower the all-important German discount
rate.
If the Bundesbank had cut the discount rate, even more money would have
flowed into Treasuries. As it is, the bond market is doing well enough on
its own, and forecasters are now looking forward to a 30-year yield below
6.5 per cent some time in the near future.

FT  02 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Turmoil brings good times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fabric of European monetary union is in disarray and the ruling
Conservative party has suffered a crushing regional defeat. Meanwhile, the
UK government bond market, which thrives on economic and political
stability, starts the week at a new high.
On Friday, gilt prices at the ultra-long end of the yield curve hit levels
unseen for more than 20 years. Rising prices mean falling yields, which
mirror the market's perception of where inflation is heading. At the end of
the week, 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock maturing 2017 - the longest-dated
and thus most risky issue to hold - was yielding only 7.825 per cent.
However, gains were seen at all points of the curve. The 7.25 per cent issue
maturing in March 1998 rose  13/16 to 102 13/16 , while the 8 per cent stock
due June 2003 jumped by well over a percentage point to 104 23/32 .
The first surprise came in the middle-maturity range, when the Bank of
England auctioned Pounds 3.25bn of eight-year stock. The size of the issue
matched the previous record a month ago, when the Bank targeted overseas
investors and attracted a poor response.
Last Wednesday's auction appeared to be aimed at nobody in particular - the
maturity was too long to interest banks and building societies, but too
short for the pension funds. It was also payable in three tranches which,
for tax reasons, was expected to deter the overseas investor.
But demand was so fierce there was no tail - the difference between the
average accepted bid and the lowest accepted bid. True, it was
attractively-priced, and the market had positioned itself well, but one
economist said the lesson to the Bank of England had to be: 'If you can sell
this maturity at this time you can sell anything.'
Then, on Thursday and Friday, the European exchange rate mechanism stood on
the edge of an abyss as the French franc plummeted through its official ERM
floor of FFr3.4305 against the D-Mark. The Danish krone, Spanish peseta and
Belgian franc were tumbling. Overseas investors, who had been piling into
the gilts market, redoubled their enthusiasm.
Yields on short-dated maturities, which indicate the market's expectation of
interest rate cuts, fell sharply. Investors were convinced that if the ERM
fell it would enable member countries to cut rates in order to relieve the
pressures on their economies and ease growing unemployment. The UK would
then need to cut base rates to maintain its competitive advantage.
Finally, long-dated stock sailed comfortably though the rocks of the
Christchurch by-election, where the Tory party lost a safe seat with a 35
per cent swing against it. Overseas investors, who have been the mainstay of
the recent rally, considered the defeat a parochial mid-term matter.
As far as the international investment community is concerned, there is
still enough evidence that the inflationary pressure which makes long
maturities tremble is a long way away.
By Friday afternoon, the Bank of England was so optimistic that it announced
a Pounds 1.3bn issue of stock ranging right along the yield curve. It
announced Pounds 500m of 7 1/4 per cent five-year stock, Pounds 500m of 8
per cent stock maturing in 2013, and Pounds 300m of 2 1/2 per cent
index-linked stock repayable in 2020.
However, the outcome of yesterday's emergency meeting in Brussels on
Europe's buckled currency ladder is bound to reverberate through the UK bond
market.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Australian Government Bonds: Focus on calm away from ERM
storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAR away from the trials and tribulations of Europe's exchange rate
mechanism, the Australian government bond market has been rallying, helped
by expectations of monetary easing and a new-found status as a safe haven
from Europe's currency storms.
However, with the half-point cut in Australian interest rates on Friday,
many investors may wonder whether there is further to go in the bond market
rally, or whether it is best to take profits and switch their money
elsewhere.
Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said Friday's
reduction in overnight interest rates from 5.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent
was 'in response to evidence of continuing slow growth and low inflation'.
The interest rate cut marks the 15th time the Reserve Bank of Australia has
eased rates since they peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990, and is the
second reduction since the prime minister Mr Paul Keating won the March
general election. The lower cash rate should be passed on by financial
institutions to borrowers in the corporate and household sector.
The government bond market, which had been expecting an easing in interest
rates for some time, rallied on last Friday's news, although profit-taking
held the day's gains in check and the market closed a little higher on the
day.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond reached 6.9 per cent, a
20-year low. The yield on 10-year bonds has fallen during 1993, from a
January 6 high of 9.12 per cent. The currency held up well, with the
Australian dollar firming to a high of USDollars 0.6845 before moving back
to USDollars 0.6835.
That the interest rate cut was widely expected was due mainly to the
economic data released last week. The consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent
in the June quarter, giving an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Economists say
that, given the weak state of the economy, there is little risk of a surge
in inflationary pressures in the next year.
Mr Fraser said inflation remained under control, with the underlying rate at
between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. However, with economic recovery
apparently proceeding at a modest pace, he warned that 'faster growth of
private-sector activity was necessary to generate more jobs and reduce
unemployment', currently more than 10 per cent.
'In the board's judgment, the combination of a sluggish rate of recovery,
relatively high real interest rates, and low inflation warrant a further
modest fall in cash rates,' Mr Fraser said.
However, some economists are recommending that investors take profits at the
long end of the market now, pointing out that last week's interest rate cut
could be the last for some time.
'I don't see a unilateral fall in rates at these levels - long yields should
now consolidate at around 6.75 per cent -7.25 per cent, and if we see US
rates trending up, that would probably influence Australian rates,' warned
one analyst.

foreign investment
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Essi, part of Espirito Santo, one of Portugal's leading private
financial groups, is launching a Dollars 100m capital development fund in
association with Mr George Soros, the international investor, to invest in
Portugal. It will be five times bigger than any other if its kind in
Portugal.
The lead investor will be Soros Capital II, which will commit about Dollars
50m to the fund. 'Over the years Espirito Santo has developed strategic
relations with new partners,' said Mr Michael de Mello, of the fund's
consultant team. 'That is how we have built ourselves up after being
nationalised in 1975.'
Banco Essi will commit Dollars 7m to the fund. Other backers will be
insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional investors.
The closed-end fund will have two closing dates: one on August 4 at around
Dollars 80m, and a second in November at Dollars 100m.
The fund will typically invest in businesses over which it establishes
control or a significant degree of influence. There will be no hostile
investments and the fund will not invest in the financial or real estate
sectors.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Chinese issue highlights hunger for
extra yield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE hunger of US bond buyers for extra yield remains undiminished. That is
the message from the continuing stream of 'firsts' to hit the US bond
markets: recent days have seen the first offering by a Chinese issuer, and
the first 100-year corporate bonds to be sold for 40 years.
With the yield on US Treasuries back near historic lows at the end of last
week, investors seem ready to consider anything that offers a decent yield
premium. Last week's Dollars 250m issue from China International Trust and
Investment Corporation (Citic) spoke volumes about the new spirit of
adventure among US bond investors.
A year ago, the issuer - a government-owned entity which finances joint
ventures in China - would have been lucky to get a hearing in the market.
Last week investors were prepared to give the Baa1/ triple-B rated Citic
10-year money at a yield spread of only one percentage point over
Treasuries, around a quarter of a percentage point lower than had been
anticipated.
The fact that the size of the issue was raised from Dollars 150m to Dollars
250m said a lot about the strength of demand - even though there is little
opportunity for investors to benefit from the sort of spread-narrowing which
made early buyers of Latin American bonds rich.
Investors who felt uncomfortable with the political risk in Chinese bonds
have had the opportunity instead to lend to such comfortably familiar
borrowers as Walt Disney, a rare issuer of straight bonds, and Coca-Cola.
The twist: they won't get their money back for 100 years.
To many corporate treasurers and fixed-income investors, such long-dated
instruments seem difficult to justify. For investors, there is the perceived
risk of lending to companies which simply may not be around in 100 years.
Mickey Mouse and Coca-Cola may seem immortal today, but the Marlboro price
cut this year has shaken investors' confidence in the longevity of
premium-priced brands.
For treasurers, such long-term money raises different issues. Few, if any,
can claim to have assets with such ultra-long lives against which to match
the liability.
Why pay a premium over normal long-dated borrowing, however small that
premium may seem? And how can they justify a move which has implications
which stretch way beyond their company's planning horizon?
Walt Disney, whose characters are deeply engrained in the American psyche,
probably has as much of a case as any for the durability of its assets. Mr
Steve Schoch, assistant treasurer, says the Disney name and cartoon
characters provide the long-term underpinning for the company. 'Those
characters have had 50 or 60 or 70 years' life already, with increasing
popularity around the world. There is no reason to expect that to fade,' he
says.
Disney's Dollars 300m issue carries a yield of 95 basis points over
Treasuries, while Coca-Cola's Dollars 150m deal was launched at an 80 basis
point spread. Such debt looks attractive compared with other components of a
company's long-term capital. The 7.5 per cent coupon on the Disney bonds
(issued at par) is equivalent to an after-tax cost to the company of less
than 5 per cent, says Mr Jim Pelgrift of Morgan Stanley. With expectations
of long-term inflation at between 3 per cent to 4 per cent, that leaves a
negligible real cost of capital.
For investors, the argument for buying such debt is simple: extra yield.
Treasury yields at all maturities are at historic lows, forcing so-called
'total return funds' to look for extra returns elsewhere.
And though the 100-year maturity looks scary, the duration of the ultra-long
dated bonds (that is, their average life, when all future cashflows are
discounted back to present value) is only a little higher than a
conventional 30-year bond.
That is because the yield premium in the early years, in present value
terms, makes up for much of the long-term cashflow. The Disney bonds have a
duration of 13.7 years, while Coca-Cola's are just over 14 years, compared
with just under 13 years for a 30-year bond. This extra duration, and the
yield premium, are a way for investors to gear up their exposure to the long
end of the bond market.
Perhaps surprisingly, given the popularity of the Citic and 100-year issues,
yield spreads on conventional corporate bonds have not been driven lower by
the hunt for higher returns. The spread on a typical 10-year bond issue from
a double-A credit is around 40-50 basis points, much the same as it has been
for some time.
The reason may be the sheer volume of bond issuance in the market this year.
In the first three months, US companies raised a record amount through
straight bond issues, a level which was almost matched in the second
quarter.
The supply of new junk (sub-investment grade) bonds followed a similar
pattern. The yield on the Merrill Lynch junk bond index at the end of last
week was hovering around 400 basis points above Treasuries - back to its
level of the late 1980s, before the crash that sent yield spreads out to
more than 900. There is some Dollars 22bn of new junk bonds in the pipeline,
says one analyst - nearly as much as the total issued so far this year.
The deluge of bonds has helped Wall Street broking houses report record
results this year. Underwriting fee levels have held steady, at around 40
basis points, having fallen to that level from 60 basis points some 18
months ago, says Mr Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
The Wall Street houses may never have it so good again. Commercial banks,
with little in the way of loan growth to look forward to, have been eyeing
the corporate bond market for some time.
The five that had already won dispensation from the Federal Reserve to
underwrite and trade bonds - JP Morgan, Bankers Trust, Citicorp, Chase
Manhattan and Chemical - were joined last week by a sixth, NationsBank.
The ambitious North Carolina-based 'super-regional' made its intentions
clear earlier this year when it hired Mr John Griff, formerly head of
syndicate for Lehman Brothers, to set up and run its bond department.
Its natural customers are not the large corporations which have the easiest
access to the public debt markets. 'We hope to open up to the market to
medium-sized companies,' NationsBank said.
The arrival of the commercial banks makes it likely that, come the next
underwriting boom, Wall Street will not have things all its own way.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Franco-German futures link raises fears of
exclusivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's announcement of the terms of the planned linkage between
Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif did little more than fill
in the details sketched out in the memorandum of understanding signed by the
two futures exchanges last December.
However, the move has broader implications, both for the exchanges
themselves and for the futures industry as a whole.
The announcement silenced persistent rumours that the exchanges had run into
substantial difficulties in fleshing out the terms of their memorandum.
Futures market participants tend to be sceptical about talk of alliances
between exchanges, and not without reason, since most previous attempts have
failed.
The DTB/Matif effort, however, not only seems to have a brighter future than
most, but also has an unusually broad scope. Both exchanges reject the use
of the word 'merger', and insist that each exchange will remain independent.
The agreement 'is an evolutionary process', according to a DTB official.
However, the possibility that both will one day allow each other's members
to have access to all products suggests the creation of a self-contained
unit for trading French and German products, which could pose a serious
competitive threat to other exchanges. But both exchanges say they may admit
other exchanges.
In addition to the first phase of the link - DTB screens will be available
in France for trading selected products and Matif members will be able to
trade DTB products via DTB clearing members by mid-1994  - which was already
broadly known, the details of the second phase have also now been thrashed
out.
The Matif has agreed to pay on an undisclosed sum for the DTB's software,
and two Matif products will be listed on the system and will cease to be
traded on open outcry by the end of 1995. The Matif's key product, the
10-year French government bond contract, will continue to be traded in the
pit, so the change will also prove an important test for screen-trading.
Mr Roger Barton, head of business development at the London International
Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) said the fact that two Matif
products would cease to be traded on the exchange floor could 'present a
business opportunity' for Liffe to trade the products on its floor instead.
It remains to be seen which users would prefer, although many still say they
favour pit-trading.
What is certain is that the Matif/DTB link will do nothing to ease the
tensions which have sprung up in the increasingly competitive derivatives
market. In the past decade, 18 derivatives exchanges have started up in
Europe, winning market share from the once all-powerful US exchanges.
However, many observers believe that, despite the explosion of derivatives
activity, expected to continue for several years as more over-the-counter
business underpins futures trading, a mature market will not be large enough
to support this number of exchanges. In particular, if some sort of European
monetary union ever goes ahead, the current number of 98 different futures
and options contracts traded on Europe's exchanges, excluding options on
individual shares, will shrink dramatically.
The new focus on forging links with other exchanges to ensure survival may
have a knock-on effect on the prospects for Globex, the after-hours futures
trading system developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters. The ardour of Europe's futures exchanges
for joining the system appears to have dimmed since the launch of Globex
just over a year ago. Mr Gary Ginter has resigned his position as managing
director of Globex.
Mr Ginter was responsible for developing a business plan focusing on
marketing CME and CBoT products listed on Globex outside the US. He has left
Globex to take a position as president of the board of directors and
director of strategic planning for Oster Communications, the Iowa-based
derivatives information group.

MR John Ward, chief executive of Qantas Airways, is to resign this month,
ending speculation about his role at the Australian carrier after the
arrival of British Airways as a major shareholder, Reuter reports from
Sydney.
Mr Ward, chief executive since 1989, said he had decided to resign for a
'whole host of reasons', but denied the decision had anything to do with
British Airways. Speculation about Mr Ward's future emerged after it was
revealed he had not backed the idea of a foreign carrier taking a big stake
in Qantas.
His position will be filled in the short term by chairman Mr Gary Pemberton.

Asahi Glass

<TEXT>
ASAHI Glass, the leading Japanese maker of glass products, reported an 11.7
per cent fall, to Y20.05bn (Dollars 190m), in pre-tax profit for the first
half to June. It blamed the result on falling sales of glass and
construction materials along with private construction orders in Japan.
Sales for the period were down 0.7 per cent to Y484.4bn, compared with a
year earlier, with core glass and construction material sales down 2.4 per
cent. Those of electronics equipment were 15 per cent higher.
Asahi Glass is a leading supplier of glass bulbs for televisions, demand for
which has been in decline for the past three years. However, the company is
continuing to expand its own electronics operations, which now account for 5
per cent of sales, including magnetic disks and optical fibres.
'It seems that a business recovery will require more time,' Asahi Glass
said.
For the full year to the end of December, the company is forecasting a 0.8
per cent increase in sales, to Y1,020bn, and a 2.4 per cent rise in pre-tax
profit to Y41bn.

3M, the US manufacturer of adhesives, magnetic tapes and other industrial
and consumer products, turned in second-quarter net income of Dollars 331m,
or Dollars 1.51 a share, writes Karen Zagor.
A year earlier, it earned Dollars 317m, or Dollars 1.45. Sales were
essentially flat at Dollars 3.54bn, up from Dollars 3.52bn.
Mr L. D. DeSimone, chairman, said the company expected higher earnings for
the year as a whole, in spite of a difficult economic environment and
unfavourable currency translations. Like many other companies, 3M is finding
Europe a particularly challenging market.
For the first half, net income was Dollars 661m, or Dollars 3.02, on sales
of Dollars 7.06bn, against earnings of Dollars 623m, or Dollars 2.83, on
sales of Dollars 6.96bn. In the 1992 period, 3M took charges of 2 cents a
share for accounting changes.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: IRI postpones disposal of SME
canned foods unit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's state holding company, will postpone until at least September
the sale of Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica (CBD), the canned foods division of its
foodstuffs group, SME. It claims the bids received are inadequate.
The IRI board approved on Thursday the disposal of its 62 per cent stake in
SME's frozen and baked foods division, Finitalgel, for L437bn (Dollars
273.4m) to Nestle, the world's largest foods group.
Finitalgel's main subsidiary, Italgel, is the second-largest group by sales
of frozen foods and ice cream in the Italian market after Unilever, while
its Gruppo Dolciaro Italiano makes cakes.
Nestle has a big presence in several food sectors in Italy, but none in ice
cream or frozen foods. The purchase would give it a 27 per cent stake in the
ice cream market and 15 per cent in frozen foods.
The failure to find a suitable buyer for CBD represents a setback after a
smooth start for debt-burdened IRI's privatisation programme.
Among those bidding for CBD, which has the best-known brand names in Italy's
canned goods sector, was Unilever.
The IRI board reportedly felt the final offers were from bidders interested
only in parts of the business. There has been strong union pressure to keep
CBD intact to preserve jobs, especially in southern Italy.
IRI is likely to begin talks with the final bidders, as well as those who
had pulled out, such as Parmalat and Eridania Beghin Say.
It hopes to establish which group wants to buy specific parts of CBD and
ensure the benefit of the break-up price is retained.
Nestle had long been a front-runner to buy Finitalgel. Analysts said the
deal would significantly raise the size and profitability of the Swiss
group's ice cream and frozen foods divisions. Nestle said it aimed to
develop some Finitalgel brands in other European countries.
The deal values Finitalgel shares at L1,550 each. On this valuation, the
whole company, with brand names such as Alemagna and Motta, is worth L700bn.
Nestle estimates Finitalgel sales will reach the equivalent of SFr900m
(Dollars 596m) this year.

AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers, turned in
improved results for the second quarter. However, it said earnings remained
unsatisfactory.
For the three months to June 30, it posted net income of Dollars 146.1m, or
Dollars 1.32 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 45.2m, or 41 cents, a
year earlier.
Operating earnings before extraordinary items were Dollars 150.8m, against a
deficit of Dollars 73.1m a year earlier.
Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said results from core businesses were on track
with expectations, but that company results continued to reflect
unfavourable conditions in commercial real estate markets.
The Hartford, Connecticut-based company said its commercial property and
casualty insurance services earned Dollars 35m in the quarter, against an
underlying loss of Dollars 25m last year, before a Dollars 26m
reorganisation charge. Catastrophe losses narrowed to Dollars 8m in the
latest quarter, from Dollars 11m.
Aetna's financial services business recorded net income of Dollars 17m in
the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 22m before reorganisation
charges of Dollars 4m a year earlier.
The personal property-casualty services turned in net income of Dollars 12m,
against Dollars 6m the previous year, before reorganisation charges of
Dollars 30m.
For the first half, net income rose to Dollars 338.7m, or Dollars 3.07,
against earnings of Dollars 73.5m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Excluding
extraordinary items and the impact of adjustments, income from continuing
operations rose to Dollars 290.1m from Dollars 81.3m. Revenues eased to
Dollars 8.62bn from Dollars 8.78bn.

PEOPLES Jewellers, Canada's biggest jewellery chain, has been saved through
a last-minute takeover by its chairman Mr Duff Scott, a Toronto businessman
and former head of the Toronto Stock Exchange. He is backed by the Bank of
Nova Scotia.
A new company headed by Mr Scott is taking over Peoples' assets, including
about 200 stores and involving about 1,500 jobs. The founding Gerstein
family will end all connections with Peoples.
A wing of the Gersteins blocked a financial restructuring of Peoples last
Thursday, forcing the Ontario court to put it into bankruptcy. On Friday,
the bank and Mr Scott reached agreement on a CDollars 70m (USDollars 54.7m)
takeover with court approval.
The bank, owed more than CDollars 100m by the old Peoples, is financing the
purchase by the new company and has extended a new Dollars 30m line of
credit.
About 12 stores have been shut, but the rest will remain in operation. The
defeat of the old restructuring, however, means common shareholders and
unsecured creditors will not get their money back.

THE JAPANESE government is to provide Y19bn (Dollars 180.4m) to help
restructure an Osaka credit co-operative. The move is another sign of
official concern about deteriorating public confidence in some smaller
financial institutions.
Osaka Fumin Credit Co-operative, with an estimated Y55bn in non-performing
loans, is to be absorbed by another credit co-operative in the region, Osaka
Koyo. It is the first co-operative to receive assistance from the Deposit
Insurance Corporation, which insures individual deposits for up to Y10m.
The co-operatives are due to merge in November, and the Y55bn in problem
loans will be transferred to the Osaka Society of Credit Co-operatives,
which will buy them for Y35bn.
Osaka Fumin was heavily-exposed to the property market and to the trading
house-turned-speculator Itoman, which itself has been taken over by the
Sumitomo group.
The use of government funds, which the DIC said was necessary to 'maintain
the soundness of the financial system', follows similar assistance to the
ailing Kamaishi Shinkin Bank. The bank is to be liquidated later this year.
It is understood that about 11 shinkin - small local banks - are receiving
assistance from their central bank, Zenshinren. There has also been a rush
of mergers among credit co-operatives, which are suffering from a lending
hangover and an increase in company bankruptcies.
The smaller financial institutions have faced increased competition from
Japan's larger commercial banks, whose share of consumer credit has risen to
36.9 per cent in 1991 from 14.6 per cent in 1987.
In an attempt to attract customers, some smaller institutions offered higher
interest returns, increasing their costs.
The pressure on small, regional institutions is particularly severe because
of close ties to companies in their local area.
This has tempted some to continue lending to these old clients even if their
business prospects have deteriorated.
With larger banks wary of taking on new branches, the government is having
to bear an increasing amount of the bail-out burden.

<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, suffered a Dollars 135.2m
after-tax loss for the second quarter, after taking a charge of nearly
Dollars 100m linked to its financial restructuring.
However, Mr John Dasburg, president, said the restructuring had resulted in
new agreements with labour unions and financial accords which 'substantially
reduce our operating costs and restructure our debt and other financial
commitments to manageable levels'.
The company now had one of the most competitive cost-structures of all US
airlines, he said.
The results were announced after members of the flight attendants' union had
ratified the agreement, under which Northwest has stayed out of the
bankruptcy courts, clearing the last hurdle to acceptance of the plan.
Northwest returned to profit at the operating level in the second three
months, with Dollars 19.7m, as turnover climbed 7 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn
and operating costs slipped 0.6 per cent.
Other expenses of Dollars 101m led to a loss of Dollars 81.3m before the
restructuring charge and a tax credit of Dollars 45.4m.
The net loss for the period, of Dollars 135.2m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 146m a year ago, when the company had reported a Dollars 77.6m tax
credit.

take toll
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank, is putting aside Pta52.4bn (Dollars
377m) of its 1993 first-half income to provisions, a 218 per cent increase
on its allocation for bad loans in the first six months of last year.
The dramatic increase brought pre-tax profits down to Pta5.7bn, an 82.6 per
cent drop on the 1992 first-half figure of Pta33bn. Banesto did not release
a first-half net profit figure.
The strict savings policy had been outlined by Mr Mario Conde, chairman, to
shareholders in May, when he announced the bank would not be paying its
final 1992 dividend and would transfer all its 1993 first-quarter income to
bad loan provisions.
The move is understood to stem from advice given to Banesto's board by the
US investment bank JP Morgan, which is masterminding a rights issue and an
international share placement designed to improve the Spanish group's weak
capital base.
Banesto claims some 75 per cent of the rights issue has been subscribed with
a week's trading to go. The demand puts the group on course to raise some
Pta52.6bn in what is the first tranche of the three-part capital-raising
plan drawn by JP Morgan.
In the second tranche, Banesto will place 22.2m shares, priced at Pta1,900
each against a current market price of just over Pta2,000. The placement is
with a group of investors including Mr Conde and several US institutions
that have joined JP Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair fund. The third stage of
the capital-raising venture involves a Dollars 400m convertible bond which
could be issued this autumn.
The high first-half provisioning comes despite improved business in the
second quarter of this year. Mr Conde said earlier this month that fee
commissions in April-June realised Pta10.5bn, 11.5 per cent up on the first
quarter of last year. Average monthly borrowing on the interbank market had
been reduced to Pta236.6bn last month from Pta587.9bn in May.
Banesto's provisions now cover 56 per cent of bad debts, against 46 per cent
at the end of 1992, a ratio which is still low when set against standards in
the Spanish banking sector. These come close to 100 per cent coverage of
non-performing loans.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: An investment with the lure of
gold - The flotation of a Kazakhstan mining venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON investors are being asked to provide Pounds 9m, and possibly Pounds
84m, for a gold mining venture in the newly-independent republic of
Kazakhstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union.
Stockbrokers Williams de Broe are to float Bakyrchik Gold on the London
Stock Exchange by placing 7.5m shares at 120p each, which values the new
company at about Pounds 18m.
The promoters suggest that this will be the only substantial 'pure gold'
company to be listed in London and that the flotation will provide 'an early
opportunity to invest in Kazakhstan.'
Bakyrchik Gold (BK Gold) is jointly owned by Minproc, the Australian natural
resources and engineering group, and Chilewich, a private company based in
White Plains, New York, which claims to have 50 years' experience of trading
with the former Soviet Union.
BK Gold last October signed a joint venture agreement with the Kazakhstan
government to develop the Bakyrchik mine, on one of the world's biggest gold
deposits - it has total resources of 28.1m tonnes of ore containing 9.11
grams of gold a tonne - a total of 8m troy ounces. The estimated cash cost
of production is Dollars 120 an ounce, which would put it among the western
world's lowest-cost mines.
Bakyrchik, located in an arid region of the north-eastern steppes of
Kazakhstan, about 1,000km north of the capital, Almaty, was first opened in
1965. More than 6,000 people in the local town of Auezov are supported by
the mine including 1,000 directly employed at a cost equivalent to Dollars
3,000 a year for staff and Dollars 2,000 a year for manual workers.
BK Gold holds 40 per cent of the joint venture and has management control.
It says the infrastructure, shaft and mine development for a large-scale
operation are essentially in place, and the directors estimate it would cost
Dollars 150m in today's money to duplicate this structure. But they suggest
western capital and technical help is needed to bring the mine to its full
potential.
The Bakyrchik mine geology and ore characteristics are complex, and this
could lead to difficult conditions in parts of the mine and problems with
ore treatment. BK Gold has opted to use Minproc's Redox (nitric acid
oxidation process), which has never before been used on a commercial scale,
to treat some of the ore.
The joint venturers intend to further develop the mine in two stages, which
they insist will each be viable in its own right. The first, to be funded by
the Pounds 8.2m net proceeds of the London placing, will involve a heap
leach and a sulphide plant being built, each to process 100,000 tonnes of
ore a year, to produce a total of between 35,000 and 40,000 ounces of gold.
Development at this stage will also include a gold refinery.
Gold, refined to be deliverable to the London bullion market, will be sold
to Kazakhstan's central bank for US dollars. The government wants to
establish a Kazakhstan currency and to increase national annual gold output
from the present estimated 12 tonnes to support it. If the bank fails to
pay, the mine can export gold.
BK Gold says the second stage of mine development would go ahead only when
the directors were satisfied 'as to the adequacy of the operational
procedures, mining methods and metallurgical processes, the availability of
funding and the status of the political situation'.
If the go-ahead is given, probably not before the autumn of 1994, BK Gold
would raise another Pounds 75m to increase output at the mine to 1m tonnes
of ore and 230,000 ounces of gold a year.
The company will be entitled to 75 per cent of net operating income until
all the funds invested have been repaid, falling then to 40 per cent. The
joint venture will pay no tax on the first five years of profits and then
half the applicable rate (currently 25 per cent) for the following five
years.
BK Gold's chief executive is Mr Kevin Foo, a metallurgical engineer who
heads Minproc's office in Colorado, US. The operations director is Mr Bill
Hussey, a mining engineer and formerly general manager of the Ashanti gold
mine in Ghana. He has already moved to Kazakhstan.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Spring Ram receives approach
from Masco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the troubled bathrooms and kitchens group, will today announce a
bid approach from Masco Corporation, one of the largest building products
groups in the US.
The US company is one of half a dozen to have shown an interest in Spring
Ram since it issued the first of three profits warnings eight months ago and
its shareholder value began to plunge.
Talks between the two companies have not been followed up by any concrete
offer and Spring Ram is not expecting one until after interim figures are
released in late September.
Masco's interest has received added weight because of its choice of adviser.
The Michigan-based group has picked Mr George Magan of the small merchant
bank Hambro Magan and it was Mr Magan who has been advising British
Aerospace over its recent merger talks with GEC.
Spring Ram's chief executive, Mr Bill Rooney, has resisted intense pressure
from institutional shareholders, led by Prudential Corporation, to resign,
as the company's share price has fallen from 181p over a year ago to 54p by
the close on Friday. This has taken the market capitalisation down from
Pounds 672m to Pounds 200m.
At last week's annual meeting, the company split the executive role and
appointed Mr Roger Regan, a building industry veteran who had been
approached by the rebel shareholders, as executive chairman. It retained Mr
Rooney as chief executive.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Medway Ports poised to float
early next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDWAY PORTS, the subject of a Pounds 37m management and employee buy-out
last year, is preparing for a stock market flotation - probably at the
beginning of next year.
Despite flat turnover because of recession, the Sheerness-based company has
markedly increased profitability since the trust port was privatised.
For the 10 months to December, Medway made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m on
turnover of Pounds 25.2m. In the first six months of this year, pre-tax
profits have jumped to Pounds 4.5m.
Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive, attributes this to 'a traumatic process
of coming into a new world. We had to change our cost base from fixed to
variable.'
This involved sharply reducing the number of the company's workforce who are
employed on a permanent basis from about 600 at the time of the buy-out to
the current level of 270.
Catering and security were quickly contracted out, but Mr Vincent said the
company still employed just as many people on some days - the difference was
that men were hired from local contractors as and when needed.
He said: 'We have moved from two-shift to three-shift working, giving
round-the-clock coverage. We also have complete flexibility - an employee
can be driving a fork-lift truck one day and painting a buoy out in the
harbour the next.'
Sheerness avoided containers and has instead concentrated on three
distinctive markets - cars, fruit and forest products - where it can offer
quality service. The company expects to receive full BS5750 accreditation by
September.
Mr Vincent said traffic levels were flat and rates had been squeezed, but
nonetheless the company had made excellent progress.
It has appointed Charterhouse Bank to advise on a flotation, but does not
rule out the possibility that it might be bought by a larger group.
Mr Vincent said: 'If it was a safe pair of hands, we'd have to look at it
very seriously. I see Medway as part of bigger group in the long-term,
whether we build it up ourselves by acquisition or find a partner.'
The buy-out was completed in March last year and financed by Dollars 20m of
loans, Pounds 15m of preference shares and Pounds 2m of equity. Two-thirds
of the workforce subscribed for shares. Mr Vincent said all existing workers
are being granted options, so that they all have a stake in the flotation.

refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, has won approval for
its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing plan from the High Court in London.
The plan has already been ratified in Heron's two other jurisdictions - the
Netherlands and Netherlands Antilles - and has been approved by a
substantial majority of creditors.
However, before the refinancing can go ahead, Heron faces an appeal this
week against ratification in Netherlands Antilles from creditors claiming
unpaid debts of Dollars 42m.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Amber Day denies split over
board appointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENTIRE board of Amber Day, the UK discount retailer, supports the search
for a chief executive from outside the company, Mr Stacey Ellis, chairman,
said yesterday.
The board has decided that Mr David Thompson, finance director and a board
member himself, is not likely to be a suitable candidate for the post
despite support for him within the company.
Mr Ellis was denying weekend press reports that a split among the board
members had emerged over Mr Ellis's support for one of the candidates
currently under consideration.
The company yesterday confirmed that Mr Paul Taylor, formerly a senior
executive at House of Fraser and now at US-based clothing retailer, Leslie
Fay, is one of the candidates, although reports that Mr Ellis favours him
above any others are untrue. It added that Mr Taylor was only one of two or
three external candidates and no decision had yet been made.
The company said that Mr Ellis would not try to force a candidate on the
board which other members were unhappy about. The board members are said to
have been concerned that Mr Taylor's expertise is in the upper end of the
clothing market and that he has insufficient experience in discounted
merchandise.

FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: BAT shows interest in Seita
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the Anglo-American tobacco and insurance group, would
consider taking a majority stake in the tobacco operations of Seita, the
French state-owned tobacco monopoly, following its privatisation.
'If the tobacco business was to become free standing and we could acquire a
majority stake - which it is not at all clear we could - then we might be
interested,' BAT said.
BAT would not be interested in acquiring the non-tobacco interests of Seita
and would be interested only in acquiring a controlling stake. Also, it is
not clear what form the privatisation of Seita will take. If it took the
form of a public flotation, BAT would be unlikely to be able to acquire a
sufficient stake at a reasonable price, the company said.
BAT was responding to suggestions in a press interview with its chairman,
Sir Patrick Sheehy, that the company would be interested in returning to the
UK tobacco market. 'France is one of the largest tobacco markets in Europe.
It is of rather greater interest to us than Britain,' he said.
BAT has tried unsuccessfully to penetrate the French market, which is
dominated by Seita. Seita is estimated to control 80 per cent of all French
tobacco distribution, and it has been difficult for foreign companies to
gain a toehold in that market. BAT has only a small operation, BAT France,
which has a negligible market share.
Recently, BAT agreed to swap some of its brands with rival American Brands,
and in the process acquired that company's Lucky Strike and Pall Mall
businesses there.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Deutsche Bank buys units from Treuhand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern
German industry, has sold a portfolio of businesses to Deutsche Bank, which
will manage, restructure and ultimately attempt to sell them.
The sale represents a novel approach by the Treuhand, which has now sold
more than 12,000 of the 14,000 enterprises under its control, though with
some difficulty owing to Germany's economic downturn and the poor condition
of some of the businesses.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has taken control of 13 enterprises,
mostly in the construction and electrical sectors, through Deutsche
Industrie Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary which specialises in eastern
German investments.
DIH has agreed to guarantee 1,100 jobs and to invest more than DM80m (Pounds
31.10m) in restructuring the enterprises in its portfolio. The sum paid to
the Treuhand is undisclosed.
The construction enterprises include Leipziger Beton Union, Naunhofer
Kieswerke and Chemnitzer Bauhoff.
The arrangement will allow the Treuhand to concentrate on privatising the
most difficult of eastern Germany's remaining enterprises, including the
brown coal fields, utilities, and the chemical sector.
Several scandals, involving abuse of funds, have dogged the Treuhand over
the past two months. This led to the establishing of a new division charged
with monitoring all contracts signed with the Treuhand since it was set up
in 1990.
DIH, set up in November 1991 as part of Deutsche Bank's strategy of
strengthening its position in the five new eastern states, has so far
acquired stakes in enterprises totalling DM46m, and has committed DM74.2m of
investments as well as guaranteeing 2,300 jobs in these companies.
Deutsche Bank itself has invested DM3.5bn in 349 branches in eastern
Germany.
Deutsche officials say they expect returns on their investments to take
several years, largely because eastern Germany has lost its markets in
eastern Europe, the modernisation of the infrastructure is a lengthy
process, and growing unemployment is reducing consumer spending.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: Trade rivalries calmed by Pacific
message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's meeting of Asian and western foreign ministers in Singapore gave
an unexpected boost to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum,
the four-year-old trade group revitalised by President Bill Clinton as part
of his vision of a 'new Pacific community'.
By backing Apec, the ministers, whose talks were overshadowed by concerns
about regional security, at least revived hopes that the world will be
spared a round of inter-continental trade wars.
Most Asian members endorsed Mr Clinton's plan for an informal Apec summit in
Seattle in November, while south-east Asian countries reached an uneasy
compromise on the future of Apec's main rival, the proposed East Asia
Economic Caucus (EAEC).
The EAEC, an idea advocated by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, would exclude the so-called 'white' countries - the US, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand - and has been dismissed privately by its
opponents as racist. Dr Mahathir, on the other hand, believes that the US
will seek to dominate Apec for its own selfish ends and that Asians must
therefore stick together. He is the only Asian leader to have flatly turned
down Mr Clinton's invitation.
Under the compromise, the EAEC will become a caucus within Apec, but will
also be able to act independently, a catch-all solution which left Mr Warren
Christopher, the US Secretary of State, and many other delegates saying they
were 'puzzled'.
The apparent rise of Apec, meanwhile, has been greeted with something
approaching enthusiasm. Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Singapore prime minister, said
he hoped it would be a 'roaring success'.
The significance of Apec - as distinct from other trade blocs - is that it
spans two continents, Asia and America, which might otherwise regard
themselves as trade rivals rather than partners.
Its 15 members are the US, Japan, the 'three Chinas' (China, Taiwan and Hong
Kong), the six countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations or
Asean (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand), Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Korea.
At the Singapore meetings, an annual event hosted by Asean and attended by
its main trading partners, the usual waggonloads of statistics were wheeled
out to convince any remaining disbelievers that Asia, Apec and Asean were
important.
Some of the figures were hardly surprising: Apec may account for about half
the world's gross national product, but then it does cover more than half
the globe and includes the US, Japan and China. The statistics emphasised
the well-known growth of Asia-Pacific economies. Mr Christopher, for
example, noted that last year's US trans-Pacific trade of Dollars 325bn was
three times the country's trade with Latin America and 50 per cent more than
with western Europe.
A corollary of this is that Asia is getting richer. It is already evident,
as Dr Mahathir realises, that many future disputes within Apec will concern
the western view that increased wealth means increased responsibility: on
the environment and human rights as well as tariffs and trade.
When, for instance, is a country like Thailand, which has based its
export-led economic boom on cheap labour, judged rich enough to spend money
on industrial safety? This issue is periodically raised by American labour
unions and was taken up by the Thai press in May when about 200 workers,
mostly women, were killed in a fire at a toy factory near Bangkok.
Mr Christopher declared that Asian countries had reached a level of
technological development which enabled them to produce chemicals,
sophisticated electronics and other items useful for chemical and biological
weapons, and should therefore be prepared to sign agreements controlling the
trade in such products.
An angry Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister and European Community
president, wanted to know why Asian countries, which were so critical of
Europe's performance in the former Yugoslavia, had not joined the Europeans
in giving humanitarian aid. Other EC officials resented having to pay for
aid to Cambodia, while the wealthy - and much nearer - Singaporeans held
back. 'They are not poor people,' said one delegate.
Another issue facing Apec is how it should relate to the other, often
overlapping, trade groups whose acronyms proliferate by the year - Nafta
(the North American Free Trade Agreement), Afta (the Asean Free Trade Area
which is supposed to come into being over 15 years) and the SEM (the single
European market) to name but three.
Australia wants Apec to be an 'integrated regional market' and the US
favours the establishment of some sort of trade and investment 'framework',
but Asian countries are generally more cautious.
As EC Commissioner Mr Manuel Marin of Spain pointed out, politicians pay lip
service to global free trade but have a tendency to huddle together with
their neighbours. 'Everybody criticises the blocs,' he said, 'but everyone
is trying to make friends in their natural regional group.'
Apec's task, made easier by the EAEC setback, is to overcome that tendency
and strengthen the trade bridge between America and Asia.
The question often raised about such trade groups is whether they undermine
the latest round of negotiations on the greatest trade acronym of all - the
Gatt, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - which are coming to a head
at the end of this year.
Asians and westerners alike argued that the Gatt should have priority and
that regional groups could make useful steps towards free trade as long as
they were 'Gatt-consistent'. Nobody contested Mr Christopher's declared aim
of 'open regionalism'.
'What we all have to watch against . . . is that we do not abuse the
strength that we develop by our numbers for protectionist reasons,' said Mr
Hans van den Broek, another EC Commissioner. 'We would be impinging
fundamentally on the letter and spirit of Gatt.' Nobody, not even Dr
Mahathir, disagreed with that.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Computer seller sets up UK 'superstores'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIALIST Computer Holdings, one of the UK's largest independent computer
sales companies, is about to launch a nationwide chain of computer
superstores.
The privately-owned Birmingham-based group, with an annual turnover of more
than Pounds 100m, plans to invest about Pounds 40m during the next two years
on the venture, which it believes will transform the PC market.
Three superstores, trading under the name 'Byte - The Computer Superstore',
will be opened later this year in Newcastle, Birmingham and the City of
London. SCH plans to have up to 14 stores open by the summer of 1994.
Their main competition will be from Dixons, which earlier this year bought
four 'PC World' superstores from Vision Technology Group for Pounds 8.5m.
Computer superstores are common in the US, but the concept has yet to catch
on in the UK.
SCH is gearing its stores particularly to small and medium-sized businesses,
which it believes are ill-served by current dealer arrangements.
Mr Peter Rigby, SCH's chairman and principal shareholder, said: 'Barely 5
per cent of computer sales are currently through retail outlets; we believe
it can reach 30 per cent fairly quickly, expanding the market significantly
in the process.'
SCH expects about 70 per cent of sales to come from small and medium-sized
businesses, with a 'small but growing' private consumer market.
The superstores, to be funded from retained profits, will mostly sell
leading hardware and software brands such as IBM, Toshiba, Compaq, Apple,
Microsoft, Lotus and Borland. They will also offer finance, training and
maintenance packages.
Romtec, the market research company, expects that 27 per cent of PCs will be
sold by a retailer by 1995, creating a retail PC market almost as large as
the entire UK PC market in 1990. 'Retail will be the fastest growing PC
distribution channel in the UK over the next three years,' Romtec said in a
recent report, which predicted that superstores could account for more than
40 per cent of sales by 1995.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Three-year peak for flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOTATIONS have hit their highest quarterly levels for three years as
venture capitalists and private companies seek to take advantage of the
current vogue for equities among investors.
A report published today by brokers KPMG Peat Marwick shows that 43
companies came to the stock market between April and June against 16 last
year, 20 in 1991 and 25 in 1990.
So far this year 59 companies have been listed, including two on the
unlisted securities market, raising total funds of Pounds 1.1bn. This is
more than the Pounds 899m raised in the whole of 1990, excluding
introductions and adjusting for government privatisations and the Abbey
National flotation.
Mr Neil Austin, KPMG's head of new issues, said the enthusiasm for new
issues was likely to last until the autumn when worries over possible budget
measures would begin to materialise.
The sharp rise this year had been fuelled by a number of factors, from the
generally buoyant stock market to the opportunistic approach of venture and
development capitalists. 'With the renewed confidence in the economy and
current level of the market, those that have been waiting in the wings are
putting their plans into action,' Mr Austin said. 'They see a window of
opportunity and are not certain how long it will last.'
Most companies coming to the market were small with market values of less
than Pounds 30m. Mr Austin warned that, particularly in the light of the
demise of the USM, this should make investors cautious.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Leather under strain in a bitter tug-of-war: The fight for
control of Gucci
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Gucci, the Italian luxury goods group, is like two shoppers
fighting over an expensive bag at a Knightsbridge sale. Although outwardly
genteel, they soon cast good manners aside as determination to prevent the
other getting the prize overtakes any interest in the article itself.
That is the tug-of-war now taking place between Mr Maurizio Gucci, grandson
of the man who founded the company in 1922, and Investcorp, the
Bahrain-based merchant bank, with which he shares control.
In the middle is the famous brand, best known for its hand-crafted bags,
shoes and leatherware. As the battle enters its second week and writs and
counter-actions start to fly, it looks increasingly as if Gucci itself, like
the squabbled-over sale item, will come out worse for wear.
The company is no stranger to controversy. In the mid-1980s, Mr Gucci fought
a bitter battle with some of his cousins, sons of the founder's three heirs,
to streamline control.
'At the time, Gucci was a loosely run empire, in which ownership of many
operations was fragmented between family fiefdoms, although my father owned
50 per cent stakes in everything,' he said in an interview with the FT last
week. In October 1990, the campaign was finally concluded when Maurizio
Gucci won a high court injunction in London against his cousin Paolo,
preventing him from using the Gucci name commercially.
The latest battle looks more serious. First, the stakes are much higher.
Investcorp, which has started legal action in New York to force Mr Gucci out
of office, paid an estimated Dollars 170m to build up its 50 per cent
holding - at the height of the luxury goods market.
Gucci has turned out to be a poor investment. Although classic products such
as its famous loafers continue to sell well, group turnover dropped from a
peak of L299bn (Pounds 125m) in the year to January 31 1991 to L225bn in
each of the last two years. This year, sales are expected to recover
marginally to L256bn. Net losses deteriorated to L38bn in 1991-92. Last year
the deficit was cut, but still totalled L25bn.
The picture is clouded by trading difficulties in the US, Gucci's biggest
market outside Italy. Earnings at Gucci America have plunged because of
recession and the shift away from ostentatious consumption. Losses rose to
L29bn last year and no turnround is expected this year.
The second reason for acrimony is that Gucci, like some of the special skins
from which its shoes and bags are made, is one of a increasingly rare breed
of independent luxury goods marques. Unlike others, such as Dunhill or Louis
Vuitton, it is not part of a big conglomerate. Although no longer entirely
in the hands of a single founding family, as in the case of its rivals Prada
and Ferragamo, ownership of the Gucci name is a prize worth fighting for.
Mr Beppe Modenese, an Italian fashion guru, says he has never known a crisis
as severe as that now facing famous manufacturers. Some smaller names may
even go under. But provided the marques cut costs and reorganise, they
should weather the storm.
Such strong action could be impossible given Gucci's present ownership
structure, which splits power evenly between Mr Gucci and Investcorp. Mr
Gucci says the gap between them is unbridgeable because of different views
of what Gucci represents.
He presents himself as a businessman, dedicated to upholding the company's
traditional values, versus the cold-blooded financiers, who would sell their
stake tomorrow for a turn. 'Just look what they did with Tiffany,' the US
luxury goods brand bought and subsequently floated by the merchant bank.
Mr Gucci claims his ability to initiate a streamlining plan for the group is
proof of his managerial skills. He says the reversal of the financial slide
indicates his strategy of trimming the product lines, concentrating on
higher margin items and reducing the number of outlets to restore the
brand's lustre. 'The number of items and stores has fallen, but Gucci has
regained the up-market image that was in danger of being lost.' He warns
that a lengthy battle with Investcorp could return Gucci to the destructive
state of the late 1980s, when, blocked by family wranglings, it failed to
note warning signals in the market.
Mr Gucci's critics, who include not just Investcorp but Italian and Swiss
bankers concerned about the group's financial position, see things
differently.
Investcorp says Mr Gucci is highly mercurial and has little business sense.
They argue that he has failed to act on the business plan hammered out four
years ago when Investcorp first became his partner. For example, they say,
Mr Gucci has consistently failed 'to present a budget which makes any sense
or which could be passed by the board'.
While he might make an ideal titular chairman or marketing chief, he is not
the right man to run the company, especially in a deep recession.
The bank's most serious accusation is that he contravened the complex
shareholding agreements between them. Typically, given Gucci's litigious
history, the issue of the shareholding pact is highly complex and arcane.
Broadly speaking, the pact gives either side the right of first refusal to
its partner's shares.
Earlier this year, Mr Gucci faced unspecified financial problems, which
required him to obtain a loan, thought to be of SFr25m (Pounds 11m). A
technical dispute over whether Mr Gucci pledged some or all of his shares in
return for the money, since repaid, is at the heart of Investcorp's legal
action. It claims it had the right to buy the shares from Mr Gucci before
they were given as collateral.
Mr Gucci denies the shares were ever pledged to the bank. 'I made use of all
my resources' as collateral, he says. 'But control of the shares was never
given up, even for a second.'
Mr Gucci has now offered to resolve the dispute by either buying out
Investcorp's stake, or selling it his own holding. 'Let's put our offers in
two sealed envelopes. Whoever makes the higher offer wins.'
However, the proposal is disingenuous. Within seconds of the proposal, he
added: 'But they can't expect me to pay the sort of price they want, and
they can't imagine I'd be prepared to give all this up for the much smaller
amount of money they think they can get it for.'
In the meantime, decision-making at the group is paralysed as the battle
shifts from the boardroom to the courts.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Christopher heads for Mideast to strengthen ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, prepared to set out for
the Middle East yesterday as Israeli tanks and troops crossed back into
northern Israel and thousands of Lebanese refugees began the trek back to
villages bombed for a week.
Mr Christopher, who is due in Egypt today before travelling to Syria, Jordan
and Israel, will be trying to strengthen the fragile ceasefire in southern
Lebanon, reached over the weekend, and seeking to revive the stalled peace
negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.
US officials were in no doubt about the difficulties faced by Mr Christopher
and the extent to which his task had been complicated by the week-long
Israeli attacks on Lebanon which killed more than 130 civilians, wounded at
least 500 and drove an estimated 250,000 people from their homes.
The ceasefire, which came into effect on Saturday after a series of
telephone calls by Mr Christopher to the region's leaders, held yesterday
apart from one minor skirmish. But as civilians began returning to the
south, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah
guerrilla group, pledged that the fighting would continue as long as Israel
continued its occupation.
While appearing to rule out further rocket attacks on Israel itself, if
Israel did not resume its bombardment, the Hizbollah leader indicated that
further military action in the south of Lebanon was likely. 'There was no
comprehensive ceasefire agreement with the Israelis,' he said. 'All options
remain open because there was no agreement.'
Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, said yesterday that the only
way to remove the threat of Hizbollah was for Israel to commit itself to a
full withdrawal from the south of his country. Once Israel did that then
there would be no need for a resistance force, he said.
But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was reported to have told a
cabinet meeting yesterday that the so-called 'security zone' in southern
Lebanon had to be strengthened. He also claimed that Israel's week-long
military action had created 'a more propitious background for the renewal of
the peace talks'.
His view is not shared by Arab foreign ministers who on Saturday concluded a
two-day meeting in Damascus at which they expressed their solidarity with
Lebanon and promised Dollars 500m (Pounds 336m) to help repair war damage.

FT  02 AUG 93 / UK fears of redundancy rise despite drop in unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of British workers fear they could lose their jobs over the
next 12 months, the latest in a monthly series of MORI surveys published in
the Financial Times today suggests.
Fear of redundancy appears to have increased sharply over the past few
weeks, despite five successive monthly falls in unemployment and government
claims that economic recovery is under way.
In May, 43 per cent of those questioned by MORI said they were either 'very
concerned' or 'fairly concerned' about the possibility of being made
redundant or becoming unemployed over the next 12 months. By July this had
risen to 51 per cent.
Those most anxious are males (55 per cent), full-time workers (53 per cent)
and those living in the south (53 per cent). By social group, skilled manual
workers feel the least secure, with 58 per cent worried about their future.
Evidence of the public's deepening gloom about jobs is in sharp contrast to
official pronouncement about a recovery.
According to government figures published in mid-July, the number of people
without jobs and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally-adjusted 7,600 in
June to 2.91m.
The unemployment figure was the lowest for eight months and coincided with
the news that job vacancies notified to Jobcentres had climbed to their
highest level for 2 1/2 years.
The figures also showed overtime in May at its highest for nearly 12 months.
The MORI survey, which has been tracking concern about unemployment since
April, was commissioned by Industrial Relations Services, the independent
pay and conditions research group.
Mr David Martin, the group's editorial director, said: 'Business confidence
is the key to Britain's sustained economic recovery. The latest IRS/MORI
index shows that there is a significant and growing proportion of the
workforce that does not have confidence in the future.'
MORI interviewed 855 people aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work,
in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain
on July 22-26. Data were weighted to match the profile of the population.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Moslem leader threatens to quit Bosnia talks: Izetbegovic
calls on Serbs to halt Sarajevo attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday threatened to pull out of
peace talks in Geneva unless Serb troops halted their attacks near Sarajevo,
the capital, and at Brcko in the north-east of the republic.
Mr Izetbegovic said he had warned international mediators Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg that he would abandon the talks if the Serbs continued
to tighten their stranglehold on Bosnian cities.
His threat came as Serb forces were reported by the Belgrade-based Tanjug
news agency to have seized control of Bjelasnica, a mountain overlooking the
south-west of Saravejo.
Serb forces now control all but part of one hill surrounding Sarajevo, which
has been under siege for 16 months. Bosnian Serbs, however, denied that
their forces were on the offensive.
The warning from Mr Izetbegovic came after a day of negotiations in Geneva
during which representatives of Bosnia's Moslems, Serbs and Croats met under
United Nations auspices to try to hammer out agreement over the borders for
a new 'union' of three ethnic republics.
Under a news blackout, the peace mediators were understood to have tried to
put pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to hand over
land to Bosnia's Moslems, who control just 10 per cent of the republic's
territory.
Mr Karadzic at the weekend offered to cede 15 per cent of the 72 per cent of
the republic controlled by Serb forces, but there appeared to be no tangible
concessions in the talks.
The international mediators have set a target of 30 per cent of the land for
Moslems, a figure they see as a minimum for the functioning of a viable
state.
Mr Izetbegovic at the weekend endorsed ethnic partition. 'Compared to what
was planned for us, I hope that we fared rather well because we survived,'
he told Sarajevo radio.
However, in an effort to prevent the republic's carve-up, three members of
the Bosnian presidency joined opposition deputies in protest against what
they saw as the west's abandonment of Bosnia.
They painted a dark picture of betrayal and an uncertain future under
'fascist' ethnic mini-states.
As the talks continued, snipers shot dead three people and wounded another
five as they tried to flee Sarajevo by crossing the UN-controlled airport,
said UN officials.
In a sign that a settlement would fuel the 'map-war' between Moslems and
Croats, Bosnian radio reported intense fighting in central and northern
Bosnia as mainly Moslem forces tried to secure more territory.
The US said yesterday it was prepared to act alone militarily to stem
violence in Bosnia.
A State Department spokesman, speaking in Ireland while accompanying Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, who was en route to the Middle East,
said however that Nato soundings indicated support for US air strikes. These
would be possible 'within days'.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Reuters has dignified the idea of handing excess capital back to
shareholders, it is worth casting about for other possible candidates.
Strong cash inflows, low debt or net cash and limited growth opportunities
within a stable business are the main criteria needed. One group which
clearly fits the bill is the regional electricity companies. By the time the
important distribution review is completed next summer most will have
minimal borrowing. They will also have dividend cover around 3 times, and
annual cash flow per share averaging 112p. Already they are trading at a
premium to net assets of about 50 per cent.
Such basic utility businesses should have much higher gearing and lower
dividend cover. The electricity companies justify the excess equity on the
grounds of diversification and regulatory risk. Yet the companies have not
been over-endowed with credible diversification ideas. And even the most
draconian tightening of the price cap next year would only make them cash
neutral.
Besides, the regulator may take a dim view if the companies operate with too
much equity and thus an unnecessarily high cost of capital. Far from waiting
until after next year's review has established a medium-term regulatory
framework, they may be wise to address the issue as part of that process.
They could propose that they take on debt to finance a share buy-back for
the benefit of shareholders, while customers might get a one-off lowering of
electricity prices. Those boards which try to skate around the issue of
excess capital for fear that they may get harsher treatment from Professor
Littlechild are only deluding themselves.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Building materials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility of interest rate cuts across Europe is providing a further
leg-up for the UK building material sector, which first shinned up the
drainpipe when sterling devalued last September. Many building material
companies have a big exposure to Germany and France. The hope is that a turn
in the economic tide will boost their earnings from the region. But the
picture is not as simple as it seems. The German construction market has
been decoupled from the rest of the economy. The housing market, in
particular, has remained resilient as the stream of immigrants continues and
east Germans repair their leaky roofs. The likes of RMC and Redland, are
already benefiting. It is not clear that falling interest rates would make
much difference.
By contrast, the French construction market appears to have slipped off the
scaffolding. Housing starts are at their lowest level for 30 years while the
rest of the construction market remains depressed. However, the government
is attempting to resuscitate activity. Much of the proceeds of the Balladur
bond will be sunk into construction. The complicating factor is that last
night's decision on currencies may also redraw the competitive map of
Europe. UK companies would then lose some of their competitive edge:
Pilkington, for example, would face greater pressure from St Gobain. With
building materials companies already commanding fat premium ratings there is
little headroom for more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the destiny of the franc this week, the Paris bourse seems
convinced it will be a case of reculer pour mieux sauter. With the CAC-40
touching new highs, investors are already anticipating that interest rates
will be cut by one means or another, sparking recovery. The underlying
fundamentals of the French economy appear strong. Over the past decade,
French industry has established a fine record of productivity improvements
with manufacturing labour costs now set at about 60 per cent of those in
Germany. Inflation remains below 2 per cent. France's balance of trade is
strong.
Yet, as in the UK, the Paris market may have a long wait before the revival
of corporate earnings meets stock market expectations. The franc fort policy
has inflicted severe damage on parts of the French economy as shown by the
remorseless rise in unemployment to 11.6 per cent. French GNP may decline by
as much as 1 per cent this year with corporate earnings slipping by 10 per
cent. French industry has lost swathes of market share to competitors in
'soft' currency countries. Domestic demand has been depressed by rising
unemployment and high real interest rates. The fragility of the French
banking system, largely reflecting the precarious state of the Paris
property market, will prove a further restraint.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: ERM bowled by a wide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last night's decision to allow ERM currencies except the D-Mark and the
guilder to fluctuate by 15 per cent on either side of their central rates
amounts to a virtual admission that the system is dead and Europe is back at
least temporarily to a free-float. But a more constructive attempt to repair
the ERM was evidently rendered impossible by Germany's continuing refusal to
cut its interest rates. France must now have some leeway to go its own way,
especially since its currency would be clearly undervalued if it were to
fall by the full amount of its new ultra-wide band.
Hitherto even weak currencies whose prospects of survival in the system were
doubtful have been allowed to fluctuate by only 6 per cent on either side of
a central rate. By keeping a band of sorts in place, Europe has at least
some protection against the most pernicious policies of competitive
devaluation. Doubtless the exchange markets' initial reaction today will be
to sell the franc, but France's fundamentals in the form of low inflation
and a strong trade performance must eventually provide some underpinning for
the franc. This could keep international money flowing into French bonds as
short-term interest rates fall.
Paradoxically the great loser might ultimately be the D-Mark. The ERM of
which it has been the anchor is now barely recognisable. Investors have been
deprived of motivation to hold funds in a currency that by objective
standards should be weak. As they relate this to the bigger picture, foreign
exchange markets might conclude that the long-awaited recovery of the dollar
can begin in earnest. That together with a weak bond market may make it even
harder for the Bundesbank to accelerate its rate cuts. All of this makes the
recent rally in the Frankfurt stock market look decidedly overdone.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Personal View: Need to legislate now on privacy law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY ROBERTSON QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The least attractive attribute of British newspaper editors is their
penchant for propagandising against a fundamental human right. They have
been at it again in the past few days, denouncing and distorting the modest
proposals by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, to give UK citizens the kind
of protection against invasions of their privacy as is enjoyed by other
Europeans, and by Americans and Canadians.
In fact, the real objection to Lord Mackay's 'consultation paper' is that it
calls for 'consultation' rather than action. It is a further delaying device
by a government that does not have the guts to cause discomfort to the
newspapers which promoted its election.
The Lord Chancellor proposes no more than a new cause for action in the
county courts (for damages up to a mere Pounds 10,000) to compensate
individual victims who have suffered 'substantial distress' as a result of
harassment or molestation, or revelation of intimate personal details about
health or family relationships. The victim must prove invasive conduct of a
kind which would cause anguish to someone of ordinary robustness; this may
be defeated by proof that the conduct aimed to serve the public interest.
These are moderate recommendations, although objections of principle can be
made to their legal fine print. It is wrong to place upon defendants the
burden of proving such 'defences' as consent, lawful authority, and public
interest. It should be for the plaintiff to show these considerations cannot
justify the invasion of privacy - to show, for instance, that the public
interest is not involved.
The only real danger to media freedom is the consultation paper's suggestion
that pre-publication injunctions should be available on the 'balance of
convenience' basis appropriate for other torts. This approach is both
unprincipled and pettifogging: press stories should only be suppressed where
there is no basis even for arguing that they could serve the public
interest.
The worst feature of the consultation paper lies in its refusal to
countenance any extension of legal aid. At present, legal aid is denied only
for libel actions, originally on the ground that the poor should not be
encouraged to bring their 'over-the-fence' squabbles to court. The paper
gives a wholly inaccurate justification for this unjust discrimination and
concludes that the poor should be as powerless to protect their privacy as
they are to protect their reputation because 'resources are very limited'.
So they are, but if this tort is to have any deterrent effect on the
buggers, eavesdroppers, data-defilers and dirty tricksters, it is absurd to
confine the remedy to the rich.
A belated recognition by the civil law of a right to privacy might be
thought to be the minimum step necessary to fulfil the promise of Article 8
of the European Convention on Human Rights. It will not be much used (most
victims of privacy invasions do not wish to relive their experience in open
court) but the occasional courageous plaintiff will set important precedents
which will make data collectors, private detectives, and gutter journalists
mind how they go.
The role of the newspaper industry in opposing and delaying a civil right to
privacy is both contemptible and counter-productive. It has involved an
expensive public relations exercise - originally by the Press Council and
now by the Press Complaints Commission, which falsely claims to protect
privacy by 'voluntary self regulation'.
The real danger to press freedom is that editors are behaving like the boy
who cried 'wolf'. The Lord Chancellor's proposed remedy is, with some
amendments, no danger to investigative journalism - unlike the draconian
criminal privacy laws devised by Sir David Calcutt, or the statutory quangos
recently threatened by parliamentary committees and private members' bills.
Acceptance of a civil remedy for invasion of privacy would end the clamour
for these oppressive alternatives, and free editors from their obligations
to trumpet, dishonestly, the virtues of the PCC.
They could instead point out that it is time for this government to stop
'consulting' and to start legislating - not only to provide citizens with
some legal protection to their privacy but to fulfil its alleged commitment
to openness by a Freedom of Information Act and by reforms to the laws of
libel and breach of confidence. The case for greater freedom of important
speech becomes more compelling once it is conceded that some personal
matters are important only to the private individuals they concern.
The writer is the author of 'Freedom, the Individual and the Law', the new
edition of which will be published by Penguin Books next month

When Bill Hussey, well-known boss of Ghana's Ashanti gold mine, was picked
to be operations director of the newly-formed Bakyrchik Gold, he was
surprised to learn that his new workplace might be hotter than his last.
After all, the arid North eastern steppes of Kazakhstan, where Hussey is
being sent to develop a 9m oz gold mine, is considerably closer to the
Arctic circle than Ghana. But Hussey's latest challenge also happens to be
just 250km west of the former Soviet Union's nuclear test sites. However, it
was a false alarm. According to Hussey's geiger counter, detectable
radiation levels at his new mine are less than the World Health Organisation
standards.

After the hamburgers come the doughnuts. Following the advances of
McDonald's and Burger King in Poland, Warsaw cake-maker Blikle is on the way
to franchising its indigenously famous brand name nationwide.
The expansion launched by company chief Andrzej Blikle, seconded by former
Barclays de Zoete Wedd executive Piotr Pininski, crowns the company's 125
years of making and selling cakes in the centre of the capital. When the
original shop was destroyed in the 1944 Warsaw uprising, the operation was
moved next door and stayed open throughout communist rule.
Five more shops are already in the offing. But the company boss - whose son,
Lukasz, is also in the business - says that while following the hamburger
outfits' commercial strategy, he's not going to endanger Blikle's quality
reputation by also following them too far down market. Whether that amounts
to trying to have his cake and eat it, only time will tell.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, another financier worth watching is Martin Wygod, who last week
pulled off the Dollars 6bn sale of his nine-year-old company, Medco, to US
drugs giant Merck. Wygod has done a good job building Medco into a market
leader and deserves the near Dollars 100m he will collect on his shares in
Medco. But should he also get a special finders fee?
Back in 1984, it seems, his fellow directors agreed that Wygod would get 2
per cent of the consideration if the company were ever sold (they later cut
this to 1 per cent.) Such fees are standard among private companies in the
US, but less common in public ones. Wygod's nice little earner has already
caught the attention of the United Shareholders Association pressure group,
and it would be surprising if it did not attract a law suit from a
disgruntled shareholder focussing on possible conflicts of interest. The
fact that Wygod has agreed to reinvest the fee in Merck shares is not good
enough.

How Jim Slater, the former financial shooting star of the 1970s, must envy
George Soros, speculator extraordinaire. There was once a time when it
seemed as if the financial world hung on Slater's every word in much the
same way as the current markets hunger for a word from George about what he
thinks is the next thing to go up or down.
Take last week. On July 26 Soros declared in Le Figaro, the French daily
newspaper, that he did not plan to speculate against the franc. Four days
later, he issued a press release saying that he had changed his mind. Why
does Soros talk so much? Perhaps he is genuinely concerned about the global
financial system, or feels he has to justify his actions so that he cannot
be accused by unsophisticated politicians, at some future stage, of
manipulating the markets.
Whatever the reason, Soros could learn something from Slater, another active
investor whose record has been subjected to even greater scrutiny. Slater's
weekly share tipping column in The Independent newspaper always carries a
note that the financier has agreed not to deal in a share within six weeks
before and after any mention in his column.
Soros's reputation for straight talking would be enhanced if he observed the
same sort of rule.

If Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, was more polite than usual when
conferring with his opposite numbers in Brussels yesterday, it may have had
something to do with an unfortunate diplomatic incident at Berlin's Tegel
airport earlier in the week.
Heading home to Bonn after a punishing day visiting the tax offices of
eastern Germany, Waigel was upset to find that his 31-year-old Fokker
propeller plane would not start.
Rather than repair to the bar, he decided to make the most of his enforced
layover by briefing the attendant press corps on the troubles of the ERM and
other matters of mutual interest in the comfort of Luthansa's Senator class
lounge at Tegel.
However, even Germany's finance minister has to obey the rules and, when
Waigel could not produce his Senator card, the formidable lady guarding the
entrance to the VIP lounge would not allow him and his entourage to pass.
Lufthansa, Germany's flag carrier, is not in the best of financial shape at
the moment, and may come to regret this apparent act of rudeness. However,
if it fuels Waigel's enthusiasm for privatising the airline and stripping it
of its near monopoly position above the German skies, then some good will
have come out of the incident.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Leading Article: High costs of going green
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmental politics are entering a new phase. After two decades of
frenzied environmental rule-making, attention is switching to questions of
compliance and enforcement - and to the costs of cleaning up. Governments,
pressure groups and industrialists need to take more account of that change
if environmental policy is to move forwards.
The raft of environmental laws and treaties which has been passed at both
national and international levels has focused particularly on industrial
pollution. The European Commission alone has issued about 200 'green'
directives. This regulatory flurry has gone some way to answer the early
campaigns of environmental groups.
Politicians have begun, rightly, to call for more uniform enforcement of
these rules, recognising that countries can secure trading advantages - or
suffer - from discrepancies in the way that environmental rules are applied.
Last year's move to set up an EC network of pollution inspectors was a step
in the right direction.
But better policing is far from the whole answer. A more measured approach
to costs is also required. A dramatic example is the US's Superfund
programme to clean up contaminated land. The US General Accounting Office
has suggested that the costs to the government's Environmental Protection
Agency and the private sector could be Dollars 300bn in 1990 money over the
next 30 years, and that the defence and energy departments could face
further liabilities of Dollars 200bn. Complying with these regulations would
undermine large parts of the banking and insurance sector. No wonder such
compliance looks increasingly unlikely to happen.
New rules
Uncertainty about whether past regulation will be enforced can also stall
important new rules. In the UK, a decision on whether to remove more of the
traces of lead in drinking water, following new, tougher World Health
Organisation guidelines, is becoming embroiled in the debate about whether
EC pesticides standards are too high.
Governments should not try to conceal the fact that some past regulation is
unworkable and that priorities must be established between competing claims.
In some cases they will be right, too, to re-examine the scientific and
economic basis for the rules. The EC water directives, among the oldest of
European green rules, are a case in point.
For their part, environmental pressure groups deserve much of the credit for
the tightening of controls on pollution. But unless they recognise the
change of mood, they risk being left out of the next phase of the debate.
For example, they have not had much of a role in shaping European water
standards because of their unwillingness to concede that some of the quality
levels they are demanding go beyond what is necessary to protect public
health.
On the sidelines
Similarly, they have been almost entirely excluded from the debate over
Britain's coal industry, and may put themselves on the sidelines of this
autumn's UK government review of nuclear power. Coal-burning power stations
are among the main causes of carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global
warming, whereas nuclear power emits none. However, the main lobby groups'
entrenched opposition to nuclear power has led them to put more weight than
is yet credible on the potential of energy efficiency schemes and wind and
wave power as alternatives to coal.
But if the environmental groups are to play a bigger role in the debate
about compliance and to have a chance of telling the public whether
companies are meeting pollution regulations, they need more information. Too
many details of industrial emissions are kept hidden on the grounds of
commercial confidentiality. Making companies publish data on the amount of
waste discharged to sewers would be a start; so would releasing more reports
from the many government committees studying the health effects of
pollution. Ultimately a civilised policy towards the environment will depend
on all parties concerned being fully informed and seeking agreement both on
what is desirable and what is affordable.
This is the second of a series of editorials on environmental issues. The
first was published on July 21.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Apple looks to Newton's law: The computer maker is pinning
its hopes for improved earnings on its new product line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer today launches the Newton MessagePad, the first product of
its much ballyhooed efforts to create a multi-billion-dollar market for
'personal digital assistants' combining computer, communications and
consumer electronics technologies.
The pocket-sized MessagePad can store, send and sort hand-written messages
and notes and keep track of appointments. It is almost an electronic
secretary. Scrawl 'Call Mary' on the electronic tablet and it will
automatically place the call. 'Lunch with Bob, Friday' becomes an entry in
your diary at your regular lunch time.
Yet, while John Sculley, Apple chairman, is telling customers that Newton
will play a central role in the 'digital age', Michael Spindler, who
recently replaced Sculley as chief executive, must deal with the less
appealing issue of Apple's declining profits.
Newton may boost Apple's reputation as top innovator in the computer
industry, but it is unlikely to make a big contribution to its earnings.
Polishing up Apple's image could prove easier than repairing the company's
tarnished earnings record.
Last month, Apple reported the worst quarterly results in its 17-year
history: net losses of Dollars 188m, after a Dollars 321m pre-tax charge for
2,500 job cuts; operating profits down from Dollars 212m to just Dollars 17m
(including interest and other income) on soaring costs; revenues up 7 per
cent to Dollars 1.86bn, but short of Wall Street's expectations of about
Dollars 2bn.
Apple's financial slide has raised serious doubts about whether the company
can continue to invest heavily in research and development, the foundation
of its success. Sculley's technology vision seems out of synch with harsh
economic realities.
As Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, put it bluntly last week when revealing plans
for drastic cuts at Big Blue: 'If you are going to have a technology vision,
the first frame had better be making money.'
Ironically, Apple, the archetypical high-tech start-up company hatched in a
Silicon Valley garage by two young technology enthusiasts, now faces
problems similar to those of IBM, the established industry giant, albeit on
a much smaller scale. Both companies have relied for too long on proprietary
technology - IBM with its mainframe computers and Apple with its Macintosh
personal computers (PCs) - letting competitors overtake them.
Throughout the 1980s, Apple charged premium prices - and maintained high
profit margins - because its Macintosh technology gave it an advantage over
PC rivals.
That advantage has been virtually wiped out in three years by Microsoft's
Windows, a program giving Macintosh-like ease-of-use features on all other
PCs. With some 30m copies of Windows in use, it has become the standard
operating system for PCs, the preference of corporate buyers and the
platform favoured by developers of PC applications programs.
Forced to compete head to head with other PC makers, Apple launched a bold
but risky bid, in late 1990, to increase its share of the PC market by
lowering prices. For a time, the strategy seemed to pay off. Apple's share
of the world market rose from about 8 per cent in 1990 to 12 per cent by the
end of last year. But there it has stayed, despite continuing price cuts.
Apple may have stretched the Macintosh market to its limit. 'The Apple
Macintosh appeals to a certain type of customer,' says Amy Wohl, an industry
consultant and long-time Apple watcher. 'Dropping prices does not expand the
scope of Apple's market very much.'
Wohl says Apple missed its chance in the mid-1980s to establish its unique
Macintosh software as an industry standard. If Apple had licensed its
software to other computer makers, before Windows took off, the company
might be the market leader today, she suggests.
Instead, the technology that Apple once called its 'crown jewels' now weighs
heavily. Macintosh is not compatible with other PCs, so Apple has been
limited to a narrow market segment while competitors have met the broader
demand for standards-based PCs.
There have also been tactical errors. Apple began the financial year
starting last September with a huge backlog of orders for the latest
versions of its Macintosh PCs, but was unable to fulfil demand throughout
the first half of the fiscal year. While competitors were lowering their
prices, Apple held back until recently, not wanting to undercut the price of
products which customers were waiting for.
When Apple was finally able to increase production to meet back orders, the
company found many buyers had purchased competitors' PCs at lower prices.
Another factor affecting Macintosh sales is uncertainty surrounding future
products. Next year, Apple plans to launch a range of computers based on
PowerPC, a more powerful microprocessor technology developed in partnership
with IBM and Motorola, the second-largest US microchip maker. Although Apple
has assured software developers that their products will run on PowerPC
computers, potential Apple customers fear that, when they buy a Macintosh,
it may be the last in the line.
Sculley is taking much of the blame for Apple's predicament. Critics charge
he spent too much time exploring new technology and not enough on Apple's
core PC business. However, Spindler, in his previous role as chief operating
officer, was the steward of Apple's PC business long before his promotion to
chief executive in mid-June.
Handing off the chief executive post to Spindler was 'a non-event', Sculley
said, because it merely made official a division of powers that had been in
place, with Sculley immersing himself in creating opportunities for Apple
and Spindler running daily operations.
The question now is whether Spindler 'is the problem, or part of the
solution', says David Coursey, editor of PC Letter, an industry newsletter.
But Spindler's appointment has won praise from financial analysts. An Apple
veteran who began as marketing manager for European operations 13 years ago,
Spindler is the kind of 'hard-nosed operations guy' Apple needs at its helm,
they say. Colleagues call him a 'superb manager'.
Certainly, Spindler has lost no time getting to grips with Apple's financial
problems. Less than three weeks after his promotion to chief executive, he
announced a restructuring of the company. 'We must significantly - and
permanently - lower our cost of doing business,' he told employees last
month. In the past two weeks, Apple has laid off 2,100 workers and announced
a further 400 job cuts, reducing the company's workforce by almost 16 per
cent to 12,500.
Spindler also announced moves to consolidate Apple's eight divisions into
five business units, giving each more responsibility for profitability. The
changes will eliminate duplicate functions, Apple says.
The effect of the cuts on Apple's prized R&amp;D teams has yet to be felt, but
industry observers predict that some of the company's long-term projects
will fall victim to budget constraints.
Much may depend upon the success of the Newton MessagePad. If it is a
winner, Spindler may be more inclined to continue investments in 'personal
digital assistants'. However, observers predict modest sales of perhaps
Dollars 50m over the next 12 months - not enough to have much impact on
Apple's earnings fall.
Though the company has narrowed its target market primarily to business
people who spend a lot of time out of the office, Newton MessagePad could
mark a turning point. Like the first Macintosh PC, introduced nine years
ago, it could be the first of many products that will influence
technological innovation for years.
However, Sculley's brainchild is far from perfect: it lacks effective
'wireless communications', as originally planned, and critics charge that
its 3in-by-4in screen is too small to take more than a few words. At Dollars
700-Dollars 1,300 it is also expensive - and might end up as no more than an
executive toy.
Nonetheless Newton represents Sculley's ambition once again to storm the
technological high ground. 'For Apple to remain an exciting company, we have
to move beyond the personal computer,' Sculley said recently. 'Otherwise, we
will still be around in a few years, but nobody will care.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Management by machismo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The message from IBM and a number of other big concerns could not be more
clear. Jobs in almost any type of western company, at any level, are no
longer secure in today's brutally competitive global marketplace. But what
is less well understood is the need for companies to replace naked
insecurity among their workforce with a redefined set of relationships to
motivate those employees whom they wish to retain. The nature of those
relationships, explicit and especially implicit, will dictate each company's
productivity, flexibility, creativity and competitiveness.
The pressures to cut, cut and cut again have become irresistible in certain
industries and companies - especially those, like IBM, which have taken far
too long to adjust their corporate strategies to the new realities of their
particular marketplaces. Even strategically healthy western companies, such
as US General Electric, have delayered, 'downsized' and refocused their
activities, redefined their core 'competences' and businesses, and sold or
subcontracted the rest. Many companies are now moving onto some form of
'business process re-engineering', which in plenty of cases will reduce jobs
further.
In the Anglo-Saxon economies, unlike Japan, a further source of pressure
comes from enthusiastic shareholders, who cheer each successive cut as a
sign that the company is getting itself in shape.
Employee morale
Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM's new chairman, is undoubtedly right to be wielding his
hatchet. But this is not a sustainable way to run a company over time.
Academic research has shown consistently that, while fear may motivate in
the short term, prolonged uncertainty creates a fall in employee morale and
productivity which is hard to halt, let alone reverse. Many of the best
employees leave, while the rest are inclined to put their heads down and
cease to give their all.
Companies which take this approach are practising the antithesis of the
adage that 'our employees are our greatest asset'. Their behaviour contrasts
starkly with the continued striving of large Japanese companies, even in
their current straitened circumstances, to hang on to the employees in which
they have invested so much. Many are doing so by 'insourcing', pulling work
back in from their suppliers.
For an organisation to remove the insecurity of its employees and
re-motivate them, while retaining the flexibility to adjust its size as
necessary, it must first of all involve them more in decision-making. If
people feel at least in partial control of their affairs, they are better
able to accept that change has become a way of life.
Just as necessary is a re-definition of the type or types of relationship,
formal and implicit, which the organisation wishes to have with the people
who work for it - not all of whom will remain as internal employees.
Sideways careers
There are plenty of models to choose from. One of the best-known is
Professor Charles Handy's 'shamrock', with its three leaves: 'core
professionals', 'the contractual fringe' and 'part-time or temporary
workers'.
Three characteristics, in particular, are common to all the models. First,
the need for many people to develop 'sideways' careers and a 'portfolio'
approach, instead of expecting to climb steadily within a single company and
remain with it throughout their working life. Second, the consequential need
for each employer to provide everyone with the time, opportunity and
resources for continuous professional development, so that their skills
remain up-to-date and tradeable. Third, the need for all kinds of flexible
working arrangements to be encouraged within each category.
None of this is mere theory. Silicon Valley companies have been applying
various elements of it for some time, as have some architectural practices
since recession forced them to slash their permanent staffs. One of the most
striking examples is the external 'managed contracts' under which Manpower,
the employment services company, provides staff for various companies,
including IBM.
Not all organisations will wish to be 'mixed' or flexible. But they all need
their employees' commitment, and must take steps to re-engage it.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Breakthrough for a broken land / Assessing the peace plan
for Bosnia-Hercegovina drawn up at the weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations at the weekend signalled a breakthrough in the search for
peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina when Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic
grudgingly endorsed a broad framework for a settlement.
The plan, unveiled by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, claims to
preserve Bosnia's sovereignty as a union of three constituent republics. In
reality, this plan amounts to Bosnia's partition along ethnic lines.
Serbian and Croat leaders welcomed the constitutional agreement as the means
to end the 16-month war which has killed tens of thousands of people and
driven 2m from their homes. The agreement if it sticks - and even last night
Mr Izetbegovic was threatening to pull out - sanctions a Serbian victory.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, his main backer, have won their war. They have succeeded in
destroying Bosnia and replacing it with a loose confederation of ethnic
states.
The war was about territory. First the Serbs, then the Croats and finally
the Moslems tried to grab as much land as possible.
Mr Izetbegovic finally succumbed to international and domestic pressure,
abandoning his insistence on preserving a united, federal state. At the
weekend he told Radio Sarajevo that the 'younger generations will be left to
realise the dream of Bosnia'.
Serb forces currently claim to control 72 per cent of Bosnia and the Croats
about 19 per cent. They expanded their territory at the expense of the
Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group, which comprised 44 per cent of the
pre-war 4.35m population.
Mr Karadzic calls the war 'inevitable' because Serbs could not live under
Moslem rule after 500 years under the Ottoman empire. He claims the war was
the combustion of centuries of suppressed ethnic hatreds.
But the jumble of mosques, Orthodox and Catholic churches - many of which
are now in ruins - reflected the centuries of co-existence. 'If everyone
really hated each other so much, why were (there) so many mosques left to
destroy?' asks Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister.
General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has masterminded the Serbs'
path of destruction - burned villages, looted houses, and bombed-out
factories. The Bosnian Serbs have tried to erase any vestige of Moslem
heritage in Bosnia. Hundreds of mosques and graves have been systematically
destroyed.
When the war began in earnest, Serb fighters, then backed openly by the
Yugoslav People's Army, expelled hundreds of thousands of Moslems from
eastern Bosnia. But their campaign passed nearly unnoticed as international
outrage focused on the Serbian encirclement of Sarajevo. Few Moslems remain
in eastern Bosnia, where they once comprised a majority. They are confined
mostly to isolated government strongholds: Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa.
These towns, three out of six 'safe areas' proclaimed by the United Nations,
are at the mercy of their Serb besiegers.
The war was waged mainly in towns where Moslems, according to the 1991
census, comprised the majority.
Mr Milosevic and his proxies have nearly succeeded in achieving the ethnic
division of Bosnia. This was unthinkable when the war began in April, 1992.
Moslems, Serbs and Croats lived together in apartment blocks. In Sarajevo,
the cosmopolitan capital, one-third of all marriages crossed ethnic lines.
But the international community, under the stewardship of the peace envoys,
has now sanctioned the creation of ethnic states by force. Even Mr
Izetbegovic at the weekend publicly admitted he was now defending 'the
Moslem nation'.
Pushed into a corner, Mr Izetbegovic had little choice. The mediators first
re-invented Bosnia's multi-ethnic 'presi dency' (the collective leadership
elected in 1990), and then exploited already existing divisions within it.
The 10-member body now remains split over the agreement. The three Serb
representatives oppose any division of Bosnia, fearing the new Moslem state
will have no place for ethnic minorities.
Many fear that the future that awaits each mini-state of the new Bosnian
union is one of ethnic dictatorship and violent racism - the opposite of the
harmony promised by the peace envoys. The west, which so pompously adopted
the principle of a multi-ethnic Bosnia at last August's London conference,
has now unceremoniously abandoned it. The document adopted in London pledged
to end the violence and reverse 'ethnic cleansing', reaffirming Bosnia as a
sovereign independent state.
Bosnian politicians, except for the three Croat members of the presidency,
have criticised the new agreement.
'Europe is abandoning the struggle to stop the rise of fascism, be it from
any ethnic group,' said Mr Selim Beslagic, the mayor of Tuzla, who is
struggling to preserve his democratically elected multi-ethnic leadership.
'It rewards the aggressors and punishes the victims,' he adds.
Lord Owen has been opposed to the republic's partition, saying it is not an
ideal solution. While he has promised to fight on behalf of the Moslems to
secure a viable state for them, he has so far failed to come up with the
goods.
Mr Milosevic hailed the agreement because it 'totally affirms Srpska
republika', the self-styled Serb state. Mr Izetbegovic stressed that the
agreement was 'preliminary', explaining that the fate of Geneva talks hinged
on negotiations over the maps.
The biggest challenge remains. In their relief at breaking the impasse, Serb
and Croat leaders appeared to forget that all three sides in January also
endorsed the constitutional principles of the Vance-Owen plan.
If Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to salvage any pretence of negotiating
a fair and stable settlement to the war, then they will have to ensure that
the Moslems are granted, as promised, at least 30 per cent of Bosnian
territory in future negotiations over the details of a peace settlement.
They must also ensure that the Moslems have guaranteed access through
hostile territory to vital ports on the northern River Sava and the
Adriatic.
In the current phase of negotiations, which produced this weekend's plan,
there have been some ludicrous offers, among them Mr Karadzic's suggestion
to build a tunnel out of Sarajevo, besieged and heavily bombarded since the
beginning of the war, for the 380,000 inhabitants to travel to other parts
of their 'state'.
The co-chairmen reportedly are upset that Mr Karadzic has so far refused to
withdraw heavy artillery, and break the siege of Sarajevo.
The Serbs have not offered to make any concessions. If the Moslems, are to
have any chance of preserving a Bosnian state, then they must have control
over the corridor leading to strategic ports and not be at the mercy of
their Serb and Croat adversaries. The plan does not give control over the
external borders of the entire new Bosnian union to the weak central
government. It also leaves open the number of currencies to be circulated.
The plan calls for demilitarisation of the Union, but it does not specify
how this will be achieved.
'There are huge armies in Serbia and Croatia that are directly involved in
the conflict,' says Mr Nijaz Durakovic, an opposition deputy who is part of
the Bosnian delegation.
The recognition of the collapse of a multi-ethnic Bosnia means the passage
to ethnically-based states. Anti-nationalist Serb leaders are now asking
where will they live. Partners of mixed marriages are wondering where they
will go.
Mr Milosevic is in a hurry to reach a settlement, with the firm conviction
that it will undermine the logic of the sanctions regime. Mr Karadzic has
time on his hands. The remarkable lack of panic about the US plans to launch
air- strikes reflects the Bosnian Serbs' belief that they have won the war.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Letter: Dynamic economies pinning futures on 'old-fashioned'
coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD G TALLBOYS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As chief executive of the international industry association for one of
the world's great growth industries, with coal producer members from 14
countries, I am repeatedly surprised at hearing British ministers and others
referring to coal as being regarded worldwide as an old-fashioned fuel.
Where do they get their information? Who do they listen to? World production
of hard coal has grown from less than 2,800m tonnes in 1980 to more than
3,500m tonnes in 1992. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
forecast is for world hard coal demand to rise to 4,300m tonnes by the year
2010. Some forecasts predict that by then coal will once again take
precedence over oil as the largest single source of commercially traded
energy.
Many developing countries see coal as the most readily available and
plentiful fuel for the generation of the increased electricity that
accompanies the earliest stages of an improved standard of living.
It is perhaps even more significant that the world's most dynamic economies
around the Pacific Rim all plan to increase the use of coal.
Official plans for Japan, Korea, and Taiwan all forecast a continuing growth
in the use of coal for power generation. The latest forecast by Japan's
Electric Power Development Company sees coal's share of Japan's energy mix
doubling over the next decade as 26 new coal-fired power stations come on
stream. Steam coal demand for electricity generation in Japan is seen as
rising from 31m tonnes in 1992 to around 74m tonnes annually by the year
2002. Few countries are more environmentally conscious than Japan.
Huge investments continue to be made in coal-fired power stations using the
technologies already available to ensure that coal can be burnt more
efficiently and in an environmentally acceptable way.
Across the world economies with a good track record in backing winners are
backing coal.
It would appear that almost every country with prospects for significant
economic growth sees coal as a prime fuel to generate the electricity
without which no country can provide the improving standard of living that
their people expect.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Letter: Extent of Uruguay Round boost to trade is
underestimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BLACKHURST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's recent article, 'Trade and macroeconomics' (July 12),
contained, as usual, a number of insights and arguments with which I am in
complete agreement.
Two points, however, warrant clarification. The article refers to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade estimate of 'a Dollars 200bn (Pounds
133bn) per annum increase in world trade from a successful conclusion of the
whole Uruguay Round'.
In fact, the figure comes from a study by Ian Goldin and Dominique van der
Mensbrugghe released last year by the OECD Development Centre. Their figure
of Dollars 195bn was quickly rounded to Dollars 200bn. Moreover, the figure
is an estimate of the income gain (more goods and services produced from the
same amount of resources) from a successful Uruguay Round, rather than an
estimated increase in world trade.
It is also arguably an underestimate. It takes into account only the
increase in market access for merchandise trade expected to result from the
Uruguay Round and not increased market access for services. Furthermore, it
is widely accepted that the strengthening of the GATT rules and their
extension into new areas will also give an important boost to world trade
and income by increasing the predictability and stability of international
trade rel-ations.
Some readers may be puzzled by the cryptic nature of the sentence which,
after noting that freer trade reallocates jobs more efficiently inside each
country, adds 'but (it) does not directly destroy or create new jobs'.
Technically, it is true that freer trade leads to 'fewer jobs than
otherwise' in inefficient industries and 'more jobs than otherwise' in
export-oriented industries.
But it is also true that under a broad set of plausible circumstances, there
will be an absolute increase in the number of export-related jobs. That is,
freer trade will lead to a net gain in employment in the export sector as
compared to the pre-liberalisation period. Moreover, these jobs are likely
to be higher-paying ones.
In the US, the typical manufacturing job in an export-oriented industry pays
17 per cent more than the economy-wide average, and there is no reason to
assume that the situation is very different in western Europe. Freer trade
creates new and better-paying jobs.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Europe will still need a monetary system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No currency system lasts forever. The one that lasted longest was based on
an intrinsically valuable commodity, gold, and arose from evolution rather
than conscious government planning.
But each attempt at a paper replacement has eventually come to grief.
Whenever exchange rates are fixed or semi-fixed, longing eyes are turned,
from many different points of the political compass, on the supposed
benefits of floating rates. Whenever rates are floating it is not long
before demands are made for 'stability', and schemes are hatched for the
regional or worldwide pegging of rates.
A good case can be made in principle for saying that either extreme of
purely floating rates or completely fixed rates, such as the gold standard
or the now somewhat visionary EMU, would be better than the limping
compromises with which the world has struggled. But until there is
sufficient international government we shall have to continue limping along
with mixed systems. National authorities will never be prepared for long to
treat the exchange rate with indiff erence, like the price of tomatoes. Nor,
on the other hand, will they give absolute priority to maintaining a parity
over all other objectives at all times  - whatever they say.
The postwar Bretton Woods system, in which exchange rates were tied to the
dollar, served the world fairly well. So long as US inflation remained low,
all that other countries had to do was to maintain their dollar parities as
long as possible, while they imagined they were carrying out Keynesian
demand management policies. Whether Bretton Woods could have remained
without the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war we shall never know.
But it usually takes a shock of this kind to shatter a system of pegged
exchange rates. In the case of the ERM, the shock has been the costs of
German unification and the German government's unwillingness or inability to
finance these costs through normal budgetary means. As a result an interest
rate policy which suited German needs has been prohibitively tight for other
countries concerned to fight recession.
It may have been too high for Germany too. In coming months German interest
rates are likely to drop to levels which, had they been reached a little
earlier, would have avoided the crisis of the ERM. One lesson is that, if a
currency system is to work, the anchor country must concern itself with the
stable growth of nominal spending in the whole area, which is something the
Bundesbank has resolutely refused to do.
Another lesson is that an independent but accountable central bank needs to
have clear and unified leadership. An assembly of provincial notables, each
of whom had one vote, might have suited Germany during its reconstruction
period of the 1950s when the dollar was the only international currency that
counted. It is hopeless for a leading world financial power, which is also
at the heart of the European Community. A better model is the New Zealand
Reserve Bank whose governor, Don Brash, is personally responsible for
success or failure.
In a famous essay in favour of floating rates (in Essays in Positive
Economics, published in 1953), Milton Friedman argued that insisting on
fixed exchange rates, and making domestic costs adjust, was like refusing to
shift the clock for summer time and exhorting people to get up earlier
instead. But this analogy tells against some of the more far-fetched claims
for floating rates. For a frequent resort to exchange rate changes can be
compared to shifting the clock by changing amounts every day in the illusory
hope of saving people the need to make the slighteest adjustments in their
habits. If depreciation becomes not a very rare resort, but a way of life,
employers and trade unionists become used to it and project further
depreciation and inflation into their expectations. The great gain that the
ERM produced for France was that it broke through the cumulative cycle of
depreciation and inflation.
A European currency system will have to be rebuilt for two reasons. One is
that a single market is incompatible with volatile and unpredictable
exchange rates. There may be other and even more severe obstacles, such as
different national rules and practices. But currency instability cannot be
brushed aside by reference to futures and forward contracts.
Secondly, monetary policy cannot be indifferent to the exchange rate. For it
is the main link between a country's price level and that of the rest of the
world. The severe recessions in Scandinavia have shown that abandoning the
exchange rate peg does not thereby enable a country to 'go for growth'. The
different British experience is due both to the fact that the recession
began much earlier and the use made of the period of ERM membership and
tight money before that to foster a competitive and non-inflationary
atmosphere.
Much now hangs on the European Monetary Institute which is due to start next
January as successor to the Basle committee of EC central bankers, and which
will attempt to co-ordinate monetary policy among EC members. It has been
accepted by all members, including even the UK, which has insisted on the
opt-out from full monetary union. A consistent monetary policy for the whole
Community, aimed at a non-inflationary growth of spending, is both desirable
for its own sake and as a precondition of exchange rate stability.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Letter: Lesser and greater evils of Israeli bombardment of
southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr C W R LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Lesson for Israel', is entirely correct. Israel's
current military activities serve to heighten the radicalisation of the
populations it so mistreats. The emptying of villages, the sacrifice of
large numbers of innocent lives and the creation of yet more hundreds of
thousands of refugees - at which Israel leads the world by far - will not
enable it to achieve its professed aim of destroying Hizbollah, though it
will no doubt end in the occupation of a further slice of Lebanon.
In the light of previous practice, it must be the presumption that no US-led
coalition is going to treat Israel as it did Iraq, imposing sanctions and,
if necessary, driving it from territory taken by force. Could it not,
however, find it in its conscience to give at least a token indication of
its unspoken disapproval of indiscriminate retaliation by, for example,
suspending the cultural relations which link countries claiming to be
civilised?

<BYLINE>
   From Mr ZALLI JAFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Lesson for Israel' (July 29), calls for an
explanation. Lebanon should be responsible for curbing the Hizbollah. Alas,
Lebanon, being a 'subsidiary' of Syria, allows it a free hand. Your leader
speculates that Israel's activities will compromise the peace talks. Syria,
the most important negotiator with Israel, is actively supporting the
Hizbollah. To talk peace on the one hand and to terrorise the north of
Israel on the other hand is simply unacceptable. And if Lebanon cannot curb
the terrorists and Syria does not want to, Israel is left with no
alternative but to 'do the job' itself.
Comparing the situation to Bosnia is an unjust statement. Moslems in Bosnia
had no choice but to flee, just because they were Moslem. (And yes, they
fled, inter alia, to Israel, not to England.) The Lebanese have a choice.
The Hizbollah, like any other entity, cannot survive within a hostile
population. Terrorism against Israel flourishes because Hizbollah is
supported by the Shia inhabitants of south Lebanon. Let the government of
Lebanon clean its back yard. Let the inhabitants of south Lebanon express
their hostility to the terrorist group. Israel will welcome these
inhabitants back.
No Israeli is pleased with these mass evacuations. It is unfortunately the
lesser of two evils, which alternative can be solved by Syria and Lebanon.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Monteverdi at Salzburg - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Salzburg Festival started out, in the early decades of the century, as a
place of theatrical experiment. In the postwar era of Herbert von Karajan it
developed into the epitome of the Luxus-Festival. Here the top names of the
operatic and concert-giving world assembled for top fees in money-no-object
performances at top ticket prices. Increasingly the 'straight' theatre found
itself consigned to the margins; by the time of Karajan's death, in 1989,
the whole formula had become horribly decadent.
Now Salzburg is back on the road of experiment. This is the third year of
Gerard Mortier's artistic directorship, and everywhere his horizon-widening
approach is apparent. Trends and themes deemed unworthy of notice not long
ago are energetically examined; significant composers and performers
accorded non-person status by the previous administration are warmly
embraced.
This year's modern-music compilations (Nono, Ligeti, Kurtag) offer a prime
example. Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the pioneering Austrian period-practice
conductor, offers another - uninvited in Karajan's day, since 1991 a
mainstay of programming. Monteverdi offers yet another - Orfeo and
L'incoronazione di Poppea staged with period-instrument accompaniment. Under
Peter Stein, Salzburg theatrical tradition is excitingly refreshed;
Coriolanus under Deborah Warner (European debut) is already a big
talking-point. (I shall return to the new Coriolanus in a subsequent
report.)
Not everyone is happy. The old guard continues to rumble against Mortier's
combative management style. The record companies, for whom Salzburg was once
a licensed showcase, are unhappy. At a first-week press conference the
Vienna Philharmonic wondered aloud whether it was still loved and wanted
here - Mortier's announcement that next year's Beethoven symphony cycle
would go to Harnoncourt and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe can hardly have
been irrelevant to such musings. New patterns of audience attraction are
incompletely formed; in these recessionary times, ticket sales are down.
And artistically not everything this year has come quite right - even
someone wholly in sympathy with Mortier's vision has to admit as much. The
two Monteverdi productions make the point: Orfeo in the courtyard of the
Residenz, Poppea in the vast spaces of the Grosses Festspielhaus. Both
succeed as splashy, attention-grabbing events; both find different ways of
(to my mind) cruelly diluting the profound seriousness, the very modernity
of the works in question.
Orfeo is a Re-interpretation In Capital Letters by producer-designer Herbert
Wernicke (a figure of note in continental opera houses so far unknown in
Britain). In a daring visual conceit, a gigantic mock-up of the Residenz
courtyard facade itself serves as set, slashed and kinked by a great scarlet
gash.
The opera's dramatic personae are - here we go again] - in modern-day
evening dress, evidently engaged upon a wedding party for Orpheus and
Eurydice at which things get out of hand. Events, some of them dispersed to
vertigo-inducing heights, are re-thought in what one can only assume is
Wernicke's dialectical confrontation of the original libretto.
The trouble is that his 'new' Orfeo plot proves obscure (at one point
Eurydice dies then recovers, at another Orpheus stabs himself), lacking in
its own strict logic, drenched in modern cliche; since moments of
illumination were scarce, one ended up feeling that the cord of artistic
tension connecting Monteverdi's time and our own had here been frayed beyond
repair. Rene Jacobs's slack, slow-tempo conducting of the Concerto Vocale
was no help. Nor was the mediocre singing, though Laurence Dale (a
baritonally rich, sensitive tenor Orpheus), Susan Graham (La Musica), the
veteran Jules Bastin (Charon) and Monica Bacelli (an Italian Messenger,
mirabile dictu, with blessedly idiomatic enunciation) provided exceptions to
the latter rule.
Poppea - surtitled in English and German (a Salzburg first), with
Harnoncourt using a huge Concentus Musicus for his fancy Monteverdi edition
 -was a bloated burlesque. In Jurgen Flimm's production much jokey
time-travelling (eg guards with portable TVs) clogged the severely logical
thought-lines of this terrifyingly austere, intimate music-drama. No doubt,
given the absurd choice of venue, some such enlargement was inevitable. This
one was unforgivably coarse in spirit and even coarser in general singing
style, with verismo phrasing that only underlined the preponderance of poor
Italian diction.
Recitar cantando, indeed] Harnoncourt's reputation as a Monteverdi guru must
surely have taken a knock. On the other hand, the reputations of the few
really accomplished singers on hand - Sylvia McNair a deliciously cool,
subtle Poppaea, Philip Langridge an authoritative tenor Nero, Kurt Moll
amazingly refined and stylish as Seneca, Andrea Rost a youthfully pure
Drusilla - will only be enhanced, and deservedly so.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: BT connects with the grass roots - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BT increased its profits in the first quarter of the year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which is excellent news for the arts. Like many responsible companies BT
allocates a percentage of its profits, half a per cent in practice, to good
causes, which include the arts.
Last year BT profits were down so the goodies-bag shrunk from Pounds 15m to
Pounds 14m, although Rodger Broad, who looks after the arts at BT, was able
to negotiate an increase in his budget from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.8m. This
is by far the largest sum devoted by a UK company to arts sponsorship, and
the probability of higher BT profits means it should grow again in 1994.
Broad must have the heaviest arts post bag in the land - more than 700
letters a day, most of which would like a cheque by return. The in-tray has
grown by 40 per cent in the last eighteen months, reflecting the financial
crisis hitting arts organisations.
Unfortunately most of BT's budget is tied up in long-term contracts, such as
the National Touring Art Exhibition, organised by the South Bank to bring
art to the regions, which mops up Pounds 1m over three years; Northern
Ballet Theatre; and the biennial drama festival which finds fifty leading
amateur theatrical companies simultaneously presenting a BT commissioned
play, which this October is Peter Whelan's up-date of A Midsummer Night's
Dream.
But nothing lasts for ever and BT's five-year sponsorship of the New
Contemporaries Tour, at Pounds 65,000 a year, is up for re-appraisal.
This results in big media coverage (most of it unfavourable about the art on
display) but small audiences, in contrast to the National Touring
Exhibitions which are attracting steadily larger audiences but less
publicity.
There are exceptions: last month's display of Picasso prints at Leyhill Open
Prison proved such a happy example of a sponsored media happening that it is
to be repeated in another prison.
BT avoids big splashy events in favour of grass roots arts involvement
although it cares greatly about media coverage and value for money.
It is now pumping Pounds 200,000 into amateur music under the umbrella of
the National Federation of Music Societies, and its latest project is Voices
for Hospices.
On one evening in October 1994 thousands of singers throughout the country,
in hundreds of separate locations, will sing Messiah, and hospices could
benefit by up to Pounds 1m from box office revenues.
BT is putting up Pounds 80,000 towards administration and publicity.
                            *       *      *
Computers and art are enjoying a creative love affair and IBM is doing its
bit to bless the union. It asked print students at the Royal College of Art
to come up with their impressions of the IBM AS/400 computer.
For its Pounds 15,000 in prizes IBM took the copyright on more than thirty
art works which will decorate IBM offices and be reproduced as gifts to key
customers,as well as ideas that can be used to pep up advertising copy.
It also allowed one computer to get a full artist's paint job, and is
considering dressing up computers, not the most decorative of machines, with
colour and design.
                            *       *      *
Being sponsored by a terminal is rather like being discovered in a handbag
but Contact Theatre in Manchester and Tara Arts are happy to receive a
Pounds 35,000 package from Manchester Airport T2, the T2 standing for
Terminal Two.
The airport is proving a loyal supporter of local arts and is not afraid to
back the experimental.
Most of the money goes towards a production of Troilus and Cressida which
will open in September and then tour the world. Contact's audience is young
people and Tara is the UK's leading Asian theatre company, attacking its
first Shakespeare.
                            *       *      *
Whitbread's love affair with the Edinburgh Fringe intensifies. It is putting
in more than Pounds 100,000 this year, with most going behind the Stella
Artois brand, which keeps things humming in the Assembly Rooms.
In addition, Stella is sponsoring a Comedy Festival which embraces the three
main Fringe venues, the Assembly Rooms, the Pleasance, and the Gilded
Balloon.
Whitbread's Boddington brand will again be backing the Dream Tent in the
Meadows, and the Supper Room is given over to Murphy's.
One unusual feature of the deal is that if the artists booked to star at the
three venues, and Whitbreads, fail to get the television coverage
anticipated some of the sponsorship money will be withheld.
Meanwhile the Edinburgh Festival proper has again achieved its sponsorship
target and - again - it is a record sum, Pounds 805,000, and an important
contribution to this year's budget of Pounds 4.3m.
Scottish Power has shot ahead as the leading supporter with Pounds 68,000.
The search is on for a broader base of backers rather than a reliance on
Scottish financial institutions and other locals.
Jaguar made its first big contribution by hosting a party at which potential
1994 sponsors were met for the first time and entertained.
                            *       *      *
Barclays Bank is to sponsor, with Pounds 50,000, the spring 1994 tour of
English Touring Opera (formerly Opera 80), which is taking La Boheme and
L'Elisir D'Amore to fifteen venues in England.
The money will go towards expanding the chorus. Barclays has a tradition of
sponsoring a touring arts company which gives it opportunities for local
corporate hospitality. It previously supported London City Ballet.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Prince - Wembley Stadium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh dear: Prince has shrunk - in imagination, in impact, in showmanship. The
attraction of the world's greatest one-man disco was that, although knee
high to Wayne Sleep, he thought big. At a Prince show you could relax in the
presence of gilt beds that hovered above the audience, space pods to ferry
in the star, cartwheeling dancers and plenty of them, mighty voiced backing
singers, giant screens, and lashings of innuendo. It was the night club of
your dreams.
On this tour Prince is thinking small, a terrible mistake at Wembley Stadium
which is only kind to megalomaniacs. Even his opening number is a joke
against the audience. Some fireworks explode fitfully, and a harness
descends to the stage bearing a figure shielded in a gold mask singing 'My
name is Prince'. On reaching landfall there is a quick strip and instead of
the man himself there is a convulsive girl dancer. Prince actually walks on
to the stage.
It doesn't take long to realise that Prince had to keep moving because his
songs are very sedentary. Even the hits from the past - and the act
contained most things from 'Purple rain' to 'Sign 'o' the times' - would
scarcely make 'Your Hundred Best Tunes', and the recent stuff is doubtful
re-treads. So its all down to the sizzle.
The lone dancer does her best, ululating through a dozen costume changes,
but the band seemed in bolshie mood, often trying to drown out the boss
rather than to back up his piercing voice. It was almost inevitable that the
stage was so arranged that sitting in one of the more privileged seats I
never actually saw the musicians live, only conveyed through the side
screens.
Of course there were moments to draw in the breath - a thousand streamers
raining on the crowds; a light show to dazzle the most jaded eyes, turning
the stage to oven red or incandescent white; plenty of Roman candles - but
this seemed a melancholic Prince.
You actually felt he could have meant it at the finale when, as part of an
interminably boring 'joke' about what he calls himself these days (he
prefers to be known as a symbol) he cries out 'What's my name: take my name,
I don't want it.' Were we witnessing one of the most public breakdowns in
entertainment history? Its a pity this moment of self doubt should be mixed
up in a tedious routine in which the audience has to shout out the word, and
the word is 'come'. It was time to go.

<TEXT>
Television is often condemned for its triviality, so we can hardly complain
when Channel 4 begins a week of programmes under the general title 'Bloody
Bosnia'. However, after watching the first few items it is hard to believe
that this will attract a very large or dedicated audience. When sticking to
factual content, as in The Essential Guide (9.00) the material tends to look
like schools programmes jazzed up with graphics borrowed from the yoof
department; and when they branch out into entertainment, as in Artists For
Bosnia (11.00) with Ute Lemper singing songs from World War 2, you wonder
what it has to do with Bosnia.
World In Action uses photographs taken by the late Dan Eldon to tell the
story of the war in Somalia. The programme asks whether it was really US
policy in Somalia and the conduct of UN troops that led to his death (8.30
ITV).
Frank Stubbs Promotes is the best comic drama of its sort since 'Minder'.
This week the inept Stubbs is promoting a young female drama student (9.00
ITV).

FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Building on the imagination - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I'm worried about Sir Peter Holmes. He was until recently the chairman of
Shell Transport and Trading plc, and every working morning he climbed 52
flights of stairs to reach his office on the 26th floor of the Shell Tower
on London's South Bank. He says in one of the programmes in the BBC 2 series
Architecture of the Imagination (9.30pm every Friday for five weeks) that
'it is a form of pain, but I do it to keep fit.'
I can hardly bear to think of the limbo Sir Peter must be in now he has
retired; how does he try out his muscles every morning without the challenge
of those Shell stairs? How he must miss that private satisfaction of
greeting his visitors at the lift door knowing that he has himself scaled
the flights on foot. I suppose we had all thought of the skyscrapers of New
York as giant 'ego statements' but not many company chairman take the climb
to the top quite so literally.
The interesting thing about this new architectural series for BBC 2 by the
independent producers Third Eye Productions, is that it deals with
architecture without dwelling on buildings. Architecture of the Imagination
explores built elements of our surroundings from the psychological,
mythological and poetic points of view. There are five programmes, each one
focused upon one element - the door, the stairway, the window, the bridge
and the tower.
To extend the ideas examined in the programmes each evening a classic film
will be shown that features one of the five themes. These films will
undoubtedly add a great deal to the series as they have clearly been so
carefully selected. Last Friday, for example, the first programme, 'The
Door' was well supported by Fritz Lang's 'Secret Beyond the Door'. The whole
series is anchored by the presence in each programme of the American writer,
cultural historian and psychologist James Hillman, who provides a constantly
illuminating commentary.
There is a risk in this sort of programme that the psychological approach to
the everyday can look both obvious and contrived. James Hillman's approach
is questioning rather than dogmatic and his manner is agreeably gentle. The
viewer is allowed to let his own imagination roam - and this is unusual in
television. Mark Kidel is clearly a very sensitive and visually literate
producer and director. He seemed to me to have an excellent rapport with
artists - and I have to say I found the artists' responses by far the most
rewarding aspect of the programmes. It was noteworthy too how few architects
there are in the programmes: can this be some comment upon the quality of
their imagination?
Critics have the privilege of seeing all five programmes on video in advance
and I can confidently say that, although the first programme last Friday on
'The Door' was good , the series gets better and better as it goes on. The
pairing of feature films and programmes that is particularly effective is
that of 'The Tower' and King Vidor's remarkable film based on Ayn Rand's
book The Fountainhead. This is the film that inspires men to become
architects; it stars Gary Cooper as the architect/hero and I am sure much
architectural arrogance can be blamed on the powerful imagery of this film.
All architects will be glued to BBC 2 that night.
Last Friday's programme on the door introduced us to our guide, Mr Hillman,
and with him an artist, a freemason and a Russian Orthodox priest. The ideas
we have of emotional security and practical safety were considered as well
as the role the door plays as a welcoming and an excluding agent. The film
clips showed many a panting heroine slamming her door against the ravages of
the world. The artist Ben Johnson has a calmer approach although he is
obsessive about doors and indeed asks visitors to his studio to remove their
shoes before they cross the threshold into his own world. He paints doorways
and vistas endlessly and is as concerned with their physical reality as with
their symbolism.
Father Benedict Ramsden almost took us into the inner sanctum of the Russian
Orthodox Church behind the iconostasis which is the screen that separates
the congregation and the area reserved for the priests. This was one of the
most beautiful parts of the programme where the camera and the architecture
were creatively used to inspire us with a sense of mystery. The discussion
that James Hillman has with us and with himself in this first part of the
series does raise important questions about private and public space. His
conclusions about the open plan office and the way it conflicts with our
need for personal territory is significant. Perhaps architects do need the
services of psycholanalysts to help them avoid the errors they have
certainly made in defining space as an abstract thing, not a worldly and
everyday reality.
Try not to miss the programme on 'The Staircase' this Friday for the
marvellous insights it gives into the work of the artist Deanna Petherbridge
 -a glimpse of her dream world is highly illuminating. It is the mixture of
art, psychology and architecture that makes this a rewarding series. It
should be compulsory viewing for architects but more particularly for anyone
engaged in architectural education. For anyone engaged with students of
architecture every Friday in August must be spent in front of the TV: at
last a holistic approach to a subject that has been isolated by architects
for far too long.

building
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 4m contract, awarded to JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION for repairs to the
M18 in South Yorkshire, is to feature Britain's first trials of a new type
of reinforced concrete carriageway - 'whisper concrete'.
The project involves the reconstruction of two miles of both carriageways
near Thorne, from Junction 5, the M180 interchange to Junction 6 the A614
interchange.
The scheme is to include the construction of new concrete carriageways with
differing surface treatments.
One of these - exposed aggregate finish, sometimes knows as 'whisper
concrete' - originated in Europe and will be tested in Britain for the first
time. This finish is intended to give a quieter journey for motorists.
The performance of the road will be regularly tested by the Department of
Transport and the Transport Research laboratory.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGGS &amp; HILL SOUTHERN is to undertake the refurbishment of the Whitgift
Shopping Centre (pictured above) in Croydon, Surrey, under a Pounds 17.5m
design and build contract. The Whitgift Centre is believed to be the largest
town centre retail complex in the south east, with 140 retailers.
In addition to general refurbishment, the project will involve the
construction of 24 new retail units, a restaurant, extension of the
basement, roofing over the pedestrian malls and complete upgrading of the
mall finishes. All the malls will have new low maintenance granite flooring.
A completely new lighting system has been designed to enhance the ambience
of the malls which will be surmounted by fully glazed roofs, 65ft above
ground level, and specially designed to incorporate smoke extractor fans and
other safety features.
Entry points to the centre will be upgraded and improved. The Allders
Department Store will have a remodelled frontage, and an adjacent 20,000 sq
ft WH Smith store is proposed.
The upgrading programme will transform the 1960s open air shopping areas
into a fully up-to-date enclosed retail facility and create an enhanced
environment both for retailers and shoppers. Work has started on site and
completion is anticipated for mid-1995.

FT  02 AUG 93 / People: Erith turns non-executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Erith, who in his heyday was the star stockmarket analyst of the
building industry, has decided to bow out of broking and take on the
non-executive chairmanship of Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, a Pounds
4bn private client fund manager.
Erith, who turns 55 this year, has worked for the same firm, albeit under
different owners, for 27 years and feels that the time is right to make the
transformation from being a busy executive to a professional non-executive.
Most of his City career has been spent at Savory Milln which was absorbed by
Swiss Bank Corporation in 1990. In order to take up his new job he will
retire as chairman of the equities group of Swiss Bank Corporation but will
remain a consultant.
His move to Capel-Cure Myers, which has been without a chairman for some
time, appears to have resulted from a chance encounter between a Swiss Bank
Corp executive and a member of Canadian Insurance Group, CCM's majority
shareholder, at a dinner in Toronto. The Canadians were looking for a
chairman and Erith's name was mentioned. John Henderson, CCM's chief
executive, said that he had not known Erith before the appointment was made.
With 22 offices and 460 staff, CCM has remained profitable under various
owners and has built a reputation specialising in private clients, unit
trusts pensions and insurance funds. A few years ago when a former Canadian
parent ran into problems there was speculation that CCM might be sold.
Canadian Insurance Group, which is now the majority shareholder, has

FT  02 AUG 93 / People: Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Jonas, who stepped down as president of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors last month, is to lend his property expertise to
Railtrack, the new organisation which will soon be responsible for Britain's
10,000-mile railway network.
Jonas, 51-year-old senior partner of Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors, is
one of the first outsiders to be appointed to the board of Railtrack which
is being set up under the chairmanship of ex-BP boss Bob Horton. The new
organisation, which will take control of British Rail's track and signalling
network, does not come into being until the rail privatisation bill gets
royal assent next April. Jonas has therefore been appointed a part-time
non-executive member of the British Rail board and the intention is that he
will transfer to the Railtrack board on April 1.
Jonas began his career with Jones Lang Wootton and became a partner of
Drivers Jonas in 1967. Twenty years later he took over as senior partner. A
member of the Port of London Authority and the British Rail Property Board,
Jonas has been a property adviser to organisations ranging from the British
Airports Authority to the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Duchy of Cornwall.
Meanwhile, former Rowntree chairman Kenneth Dixon, 63, has been reappointed
as a part-time BR board member for two years.

FT  02 AUG 93 / People: Barclays refocuses on Far East
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the recent losses suffered by investment banks trading in Japanese
equities, Barclays has reinforced its commitment to the Far East - and the
links between operations of its BZW investment banking arm in London and
Tokyo - with a series of appointments in Britain and Japan.
The most senior move is the appointment of Ben Grigsby, the group's country
manager for Japan, to the new post of deputy chief executive for the BZW
markets division responsible for sales and distribution of BZW services. He
is being rewarded for managing Japan through a difficult trading climate.
Grigsby will be joined in London by Saburo Shinoda, the president of
Barclays Trust and Banking in Japan, who will become a director of BZW and
lead a team trying to improve BZW's services to Japanese corporate and
institutional customers. The moves will take place from September 1.
In Japan, Callum McCarthy will become group country manager in addition to
his role as chief executive of Japan Barclays Bank. Peter Fenichel, managing
director in BZW's debt capital markets unit in London, will move to Japan as
president of BZW Securities there, and still run global private placements.
The interlinking of operations between London and Tokyo might surprise
competitors such as National Westminster, which has withdrawn from Japanese
equities after suffering losses. But McCarthy says BZW has a big enough
spread of securities businesses to balance equities losses last year.
McCarthy says BZW - which has overall responsibility for Barclays operations
in Japan - 'looked carefully' at its operations there before reinforcing the
links. It thinks the combination of strong trade flows and a high personal
savings ratio will provide plenty of business opportunities.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Management: Acting the guru - John Cleese talks to Lucy
Kellaway about his unlikely role of management trainer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Cleese is not your regular management guru. Gurus take themselves
seriously, are pompous, present common sense as science and drop big names
in business.
By contrast, Cleese thinks the tricks of management are pretty obvious. He
spends no time talking to businessmen, claiming he does not know any. He is
as much the ordinary bloke as his towering fame will allow. He sits in his
seriously rich Notting Hill house looking casual in a grey track suit, and
is so adamant he knows nothing that his minder has to intervene.
'No, John,' she says, 'you are so perceptive. You look at a series of
problems that are presented by a company, and your strength is saying I
don't believe that is their problem, it is something deeper.'
Her name is Tina Tietjen. Since she and a partner paid Pounds 50m in a
management buy-out for his video training company, Video Arts, she has had a
particular interest in selling Cleese's management skills.
In this she has been supremely successful: Cleese, the British comedy actor
who shot to fame with the Monty Python television series, has become the
world's most popular management trainer. Millions of managers have watched
him play the part of buffoon manager in training videos. In the US,
thousands have flocked to hear him lecture on management, and many more
thousands have paid Pounds 250 for a 30-minute video of the occasion. Even
veteran guru Peter Drucker is not that big.
Managers who have bought the videos are now buying the book. Co-written with
his analyst Robyn Skynner, Life and How to Survive It coins the phrase
'healthy company', and argues that healthy companies resemble healthy
families, only bigger.
Management is an odd interest for a comic. How did it all begin? Cleese, as
is now his way, immediately reaches for the psycho-analytical rather than
the hysterical answer. It was because he was the only child of elderly
parents and, therefore, was drawn towards teams, he begins.
But surely it is a long way from being a lonely child to making training
videos about how to make meetings more productive?
'Meetings with the Python team were a low-grade nightmare,' he says. 'So
when someone asked me in 1976 to write a film about how to run an efficient
meeting, I found it fascinating. And then once you've done one area you get
interested in another and then there's an area in between.'
Cleese lives by two of his central tenets: never to pretend he knows
something when he does not, and to admit to making mistakes. This makes him
frustratingly hard to pin down. 'People sometimes ask me what's going on in
British industry and I say I don't know. There's no point pretending I do.'
Tietjen starts to look anxious again and points out that John is a natural
teacher.
Cleese reluctantly admits that after giving his speech about the value of
making mistakes he gets mobbed by managers saying: 'I wish you could tell my
boss that.' The speech makes a distinction between 'the copper-bottomed
mistakes like wearing a black bra under a white blouse' and those which are
a fair try but just happen to be wrong.
Does he think that people who have watched the videos have taken note?
'People who are quite reasonably healthy will learn things and will change,'
he says, and as if to prove the point he cites a personal example. 'When I
was first in showbiz I was frequently 10 minutes late for things. I realised
that I was not leaving enough time to get there.' So he changed; simple as
that.
When Cleese admits to knowing anything, he puts it down to intuition. It is
this that allows him to sort out a good team from a bad one. 'The first
thing you notice is that you feel something isn't quite right. Then you do a
bit of digging around to try to figure it out. If you use your intuition -
which men in our society don't really use or trust very much - you can
fairly easily see if people are communicating with each other in an open
way, or if they both have hidden agendas.'
He cites two recent films he has been involved in. One has been easy because
everyone knew who was meant to be doing what. The other has been a dog's
breakfast. 'You realise the thing is out of control, and everyone is making
it up as they go along. I believe that if you can get egos out of the way,
be straight with people, listen to what they say, it is amazing what can be
achieved.'
However this smooth-running, plain-dealing is not the norm. 'Most people try
to create mythologies about themselves. They pretend they know when they
don't know, get stuck in all these little acts.' Worst, he says, was Robert
Maxwell, 'the most complete clown in Britain'. Cleese takes a dim view of
most big businessmen: 'The sad thing about our culture is that it expects
this sort of egotism from people at the top of companies. Their behaviour is
very like five-year-olds. It is only the powerful people who can get away
with it, and because they are so visible, they are seen as heros.'
It is not just the big bosses who are inadequate. Many people are not in
good enough psychological nick to be ready for the healthy company he and
Skynner describe. 'A lot of people are not going to like it,' he says. 'If
you want to go into a healthy company you better be fairly healthy yourself.
If you come from a very distrustful, manipulating family and go into an
organisation where people are open with each other it would drive you mad.'
The difference between a healthy and unhealthy company, he and his shrink
have figured out, is confidence. 'Not the bloated, sticking chest out
strutting around confidence,' he says, his words creating a rare glimpse of
the old manic Cleese. The confidence is the quiet confidence of a batsman.
And how should companies acquire it?
Not for the first time, he says: 'I don't know.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / Management: A cross-cultural minefield - The surprises that
ensued when British managers set out to teach the Russians western skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 9am nearly half the training course had retired with a hangover. Two more
had vanished, apparently conducting a romance. And though the rest seemed
eager to learn about management skills, several more were stuck in Moscow,
awaiting their correct papers.
By the traditions of Russian industry, this may have been nothing new. But
for the British organisers of the seminar it was a vivid reminder that
teaching western management skills to a Russian audience is, at best, an
unpredictable task.
Few doubt that the Russians will need a heavy investment in training to help
their economy undergo transformation. But the type of business training that
is appropriate - and how it can be imparted in an effective manner - is an
issue that remains a potential cross-cultural minefield.
This particular exchange, arranged between Moscow Business School and Henley
Management College, and sponsored by Digital, set out to address a key
question: in a culture which has had no experience of western-style
management or personnel skills, how do you create responsible and decisive
managers?
Or, to use the management training terms, how do you set about 'empowering'
ex-bureaucrats?
To tackle the theme, the 10 Russians, some from business, others from the
Moscow Business School, were allowed to window-shop on a range of western
management theories - British Petroleum told them about personnel strategy,
Dun and Bradstreet spoke about human resource management, while Digital
representatives lectured on issues ranging from the EC to employee
empowerment.
In an atmosphere of polite bemusement, the Russians were handed a series of
'machine sense tools' - not unlike multi-coloured designer toys - and told
to analyse them in a session on confidence building and decision making.
'It has long been argued that if you give people the freedom and tell them
they have it, they will be empowered,' said Helen Kelly, an American
psychologist, who devised the exercise as a means of teaching employees and
troubled teenagers self confidence and innovation.
'It's very exciting to see what can happen with this,' echoed Derek Thomson,
a management consultant with Kodak, who explained that his company had
already used the exercise on the factory floor in the US, with some 'very
encouraging' results. 'The best thing is that it can be used in any
language.'
The Russians, who seemed as intrigued by the glue sticks and complimentary
Kodak cameras as the toys themselves, obediently set to work.
By the end of the morning, they had produced a range of paper machines, on
which some chose to express their creativity by doodling designs.
'The thing about this is that you can learn to do things you thought you
couldn't,' explained Kelly, through an interpreter, who had gainfully
succeeded in translating 'empowerment' but had rather more problems
translating the word 'fun'.
And what did the Russians think they had learnt?
'It's all been very unusual, but I am not sure that I can use it in my work
with customs regulations,' admited Natalia Koulikova, who worked in
international trade at the Moscow Business School.
Marina Mdivani, a professor in human resource management, was rather more
hopeful.
Russian managers desperately need, she said, to learn the principles of
conflict, control and personnel management. And, indeed, she found the
'empowerment' message both fascinating and apt.
'But the problem is that we don't have very much money for all these
exercises now,' she said. 'Most managers are more concerned with profits
than playing with paper games.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / Hunt holds line against VAT rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day signalled its determination not to backtrack on
plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel but vowed to be more
receptive to criticism of its policies.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said he would not favour any 'jiggling
around' with proposals to levy VAT on fuel at 8 per cent from next April and
the full 17.5 per cent from 1995. But he acknowledged that the plans had
been a factor in last week's crushing defeat of the Conservatives in the
Christchurch by-election.
Speaking on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Hunt said the Tories
had bounced back from by-election setbacks before because they had been
prepared subsequently to listen to what people said.
'We listen or we die,' he warned. 'My view after Christchurch and indeed
after Newbury is one really of deja vu rather than desperation. We have been
through this before.'
Admitting that the government was failing to explain itself effectively to
voters, Mr Hunt said: 'We do need to explain things in language that people
can understand and we have to redouble our efforts to do just that.'
His remarks came as Tory critics of the proposals for VAT on fuel expressed
increasing confidence that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would announce
a U-turn in his first Budget, which is in November.
Mr William Powell, the Conservative MP for Corby, said it was clear there
would have to be some reform. 'Everybody knows there is going to be a
retreat.' He added that the government was holding its existing line only
because it had no choice until it decided what its new line was going to be.
Mr Powell - who was one of two Tories to rebel over the government's plans
when MPs voted on them in May - said he expected Mr Clarke to use the Budget
to make clear that the rate at which VAT would be levied on fuel would be
restricted to 8 per cent or less.
This announcement would be tempered by a significant broadening of the range
of goods on which the tax was imposed. Mr Powell added: 'It is quite obvious
VAT will be put on newspapers and magazines.'
Meanwhile, a fresh indication of how much ground the government has lost
came with the publication of a poll putting the Tories in third place behind
the Liberal Democrats.
The poll - conducted by MORI and published in yesterday's Sunday Times  -
puts the latest state of the parties at Labour 41 per cent, Liberal
Democrats 28 per cent and Conservatives 27 per cent.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Unions look beyond Labour for support with campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS ARE increasingly turning to cross-party political lobbying instead of
depending on the eventual return of a Labour government, judging by the
preliminary agenda for this year's Trades Union Congress to be held in
Brighton next month.
Although the campaign by several large TUC unions to retain their influence
in the Labour party is bound to dominate the congress, few motions even
mention the party.
A motion from the CPSA Civil Service union specifically asks that a campaign
to defend public services should 'seek the support of all parties
represented in parliament'. In another motion the CPSA calls for joint
action with the Confederation of British Industry.
The largest number of motions, 11 in all, protest against the government's
latest labour legislation. There is particular concern about some elements
of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993, including a late
amendment that has the effect of giving employers the right to deny pay
increases to staff who refuse to sign personal contracts.
Mr John Monks, who will take over as TUC general secretary at the end of the
congress when Mr Norman Willis retires, is expected to back this new
campaigning tone. Mr Monks has already made clear that he wishes to
influence all the main political parties and that he does not want 'too many
eggs in one basket'.
He will also, in a keynote speech, set out what sort of TUC he wishes to
lead. Mr Monks takes over at a difficult time for the TUC, with membership
lower than at any time since 1945.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, yesterday stressed the need to loosen ties with Labour. He noted that
the US anti-union legislation of the Reagan-Bush Republican administrations
is being reversed in spite of the lack of formal links between unions and
the Democrats. The percentage of union members paying their dues by direct
debit has nearly doubled from 4.8 per cent to 8 per cent since 1991, the
Labour Research Department, the independent labour movement organisation,
says. However the 'check-off' of dues by employers still remains the most
popular method with 82 per cent paying this way.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Curriculum cuts urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL PROPOSALS to slim down the national curriculum for schools in
England and Wales and to concentrate on basic skills will be presented to
the government today by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the Schools
Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
The interim report of Sir Ron's review of school curriculum and testing will
agree with critics who have accused the national curriculum of being too
prescriptive.
His report will recommend reducing the curriculum to occupy less than 75 per
cent of the school day and concentrating on fewer subjects in the compulsory
tests carried out at the ages of seven, 11, 14 and 16.
Sir Ron will also recommend investigation of new ways of presenting the
results of the tests. The use of the results for compiling school league
tables has aroused intense opposition among teachers.
Among the options are the use of 'value-added' measures of school
performance to recognise the achievement of schools that get good results in
difficult circumstances.
The interim report will be received by Baroness Blatch, the education
minister, on behalf of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, who has been
suffering from a viral infection.
Lady Blatch is expected to announce whether the government will proceed with
publishing the results of this year's tests for seven-year-olds and
14-year-olds.
As most schools have boycotted the tests, the data submitted to the
Department for Education is likely to be too patchy to be of value in
compiling league tables.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Northern Rock tops league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN ROCK, the 11th largest building society, has taken first place in
the yearly analysis of the performance of the largest 20 societies carried
out by Mr John Wriglesworth, the analyst at UBS Global Research regarded as
the industry's leading observer.
The performance table, which has attracted some criticism but is closely
watched by building society executives, ranks societies according to 12
performance ratios including measures of profitability, capital strength,
management expenses, market share and interest margin.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, has slipped to second
place based on 1992 financial performance. Yorkshire, the 12th largest, has
risen to third from fourth in a year when societies were under pressure from
high levels of mortgage bad debt.
Societies whose ranking was badly affected by high mortgage arrears in the
troubled southern housing market included Bristol &amp; West, the 10th biggest
by asset size, which slipped seven places to 16th, and Chelsea, the 18th
largest society, which fell three places to 19th position.
Mr Wriglesworth said a notable feature of last year was the wide variation
in societies' financial performance. Although many were affected by bad
debt, a quarter of the top 20 managed to raise profits by more than 15 per
cent and no society's pre-tax profits fell by more than 50 per cent.
He said he did not believe that any of the top 20 societies would need to be
'rescued' by merger with a larger society 'in the foreseeable future'.
Abbey National, the second largest mortgage lender after Halifax Building
Society, would have ranked ninth behind Derbyshire Building Society in the
UBS performance table if it had still been a society. It became a bank in
1989 and reports its interim results today.
A separate analysis of bad debt and mortgage arrears in the report finds
that Chelsea has the worst proportion of arrears in three of four
categories. Its mortgage provision charge as a proportion of mortgage value
was 2.52, compared with only 0.10 for Derbyshire, which had the best book.

FT  02 AUG 93 / City considers permanent security cordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Corporation of London, the City's local authority, is expected to
publish a set of proposals tomorrow designed to reduce the risk of further
bomb attacks by the IRA.
The most controversial measure being considered is the creation of a
permanent security cordon around the City. This would involve maintaining
the road blocks and checkpoints that it installed temporarily last month.
The corporation believes that the predominant acceptance by the public of
the temporary cordon strengthens the case for making it permanent.
The corporation will also propose a range of surveillance measures to
improve security within the City.
These include an increased number of security cameras, neighbourhood watch
schemes and greater co-ordination of companies' security staff and camera
systems.
The corporation also proposes removing all litter bins and rubbish bags from
the streets. It has already taken away 1,000 litter bins following the
Bishopsgate bomb in April.
Other measures include the introduction of a pager alarm system to alert
people to bomb warnings. This would be offered to City workers at a cost of
about Pounds 150 a year each. In the Bishopsgate bomb, some workers were
unable to hear police loud hailers telling them to evacuate buildings.
City businesses and other interested parties will be consulted in the next
few weeks. The consultation document will be widely distributed and the
corporation will also hold a series of public meetings.
The proposals have been drawn up in consultation with a steering committee
on security set up in early June, composed of the City police, the Bank of
England and various securities houses. The corporation has also held
meetings with representatives of more than 400 City businesses.
The measures come in the wake of the recent City bomb attacks. The latest
estimates of the cost of the Bishopsgate bomb is about Pounds 500m, while
the cost of the St Mary Axe bomb a year earlier was about Pounds 350m,
according to the Association of British Insurers.
The Bishopsgate attack increased the pressure on the Corporation of London
to take visible anti-terrorist measures.
The new proposals are designed to restrict the extent of potential bomb
damage - the corporation acknowledges that it cannot prevent hand-carried
devices being brought into the security area.
It has put aside for the time being suggestions that the City should be made
a pedestrian zone because this would involve a lengthy public inquiry.
However Mr Michael Cassidy, who heads the corporation's policy and resources
committee, said that if existing measures worked well there was 'a very real
justification to move forward to pedestrianisation'.
The corporation has written to Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, asking
him to consider giving the police powers to search vehicles. At present the
police can do so only with the owner's permission.
The Home Office has agreed to bear half of the cost of an extra 57 police to
improve security in the City.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Managers sceptical on training targets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT-BACKED tar-gets for improving workers' skills are unlikely to be
achieved, a study published today by the Industrial Society shows.
A survey of 620 personnel and training managers found that a large majority
were sceptical of seven of the eight principal targets.
The targets, launched by the Confederation of British Industry and other
organisations in 1991, were intended to increase the number of staff
receiving training and vocational qualifications by the end of the decade.
But there was only one target - training for all employees to be the norm by
1996 - over which managers who were optimistic of success outnumbered those
who were pessimistic.
Ms Rhiannon Chapman, society director, said: 'There is a clear warning to
ministers and others that without more support and publicity this initiative
is going to fail - leaving Britain even further behind our competitors on
skills.'
The level of basic pay rises across the economy has continued on a downward
trend, according to provisional figures published today by Industrial
Relations Services, the independent pay research company.
It said that in the three months to June, settlements fell to 2 per cent
compared with 2.3 per cent in the three months to May.

FT  02 AUG 93 / ICI in 10,000-job project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the largest commercial developments in Britain is being planned by
Imperial Chemical Industries on 1,500 acres at Severnside near Bristol. ICI
believes that eventually there could be employment for more than 10,000
people.
ICI describes the land, next to its Severnside works, as a 'major strategic
holding'. Mr Andrew Sturt, group property manager, said: 'We have a
fantastic opportunity and will provide competition for every major site in
the region.'
The company will not act as the sole developer but is in informal
discussions about partnerships which might take the form of joint ventures
or a consortium. Mr Sturt said: 'We will invest money to enhance the
landholding but there is no prospect of ICI entering into development as a
risk-taker. We are concentrating on our core businesses.'
A manufacturing plant, a distribution park and a research park are among
ICI's proposals for what is expected to be at least a decade of development.
Most of the land is let to tenant farmers but there is a long-standing
planning consent for the whole site.
The University of Bristol has agreed to be part of the research park to
develop closer links with industry. It said: 'Precisely what would be in our
building would be decided by the nature of the companies there - it would be
market-led.'
The land, which ICI has owned for more than 30 years, straddles the M49
approach motorway being built to the second Severn crossing, due to open
early in 1996. Planning permission is already being sought for an
interchange with the M49. The site is also close to the M4, the M5 and the
Avonmouth docks.
Mr Robert Durie, of King Sturge, the property adviser to the scheme, said:
'It is a very exciting opportunity. It is of a very significant size and we
are not going to race at it but plan it carefully.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / Major's shotgun marriage threatens Anglo-Irish pact / A look
at how the government may have bolstered its majority but at the cost of a
crisis in cross-border relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COLLAPSE of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and a crisis in cross-border
relations could be the price to be paid for Mr John Major's courtship of the
Ulster Unionist party at Westminster to bolster his government's majority.
The crushing defeat of the Tories at the Christchurch by-election on
Thursday, leaving them with a majority of just 17, and continuing threats of
rebellion on the Tory backbenches have given Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP
leader, the opportunity he has long been looking for. He now hopes to drive
a wedge between London and Dublin and to reverse what Unionists perceive to
be the growing influence of the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland's
affairs.
In return for the support of his nine MPs, Mr Molyneaux said last week that
he had reached an 'understanding' with Mr Major. The government has
repeatedly denied that a deal was struck.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said 'there has not been any
last-minute deal signed up in legal terms'. Talks had being going on for
months 'resulting from government frustration with the Northern Ireland
round-table talks process and the intransigence of the Irish government and
the (nationalist) SDLP'. He added: 'The government has for some time been
indicating a willingness, if all else fails, to consider changes in the way
Northern Ireland is to be governed.'
Some of the changes envisaged by the UUP include the establishment of a
Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster, the broadening of local
government powers in the province and 'greater attention being paid to
persons with experience in security issues'.
Asked whether these changes would signify the abandonment of the Anglo-Irish
Agreement Mr Maginnis said: 'I certainly hope so.' Mr Molyneaux said last
week he expects the agreement 'to wither away'.
This has set alarm bells jangling in Dublin. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister, said last week he would be 'very concerned' by any
unilateral moves made by the British government on Northern Ireland.
One of his aides said: 'If a clear warning is made to London that any
unilateral move would be viewed as undermining the Anglo-Irish Agreement,
but they go ahead and do it anyway, then one can only conclude that this
would lead to a major crisis in Anglo-Irish relations'.
The fact that Mr Reynolds has stepped into the fray, not leaving it solely
to Mr Dick Spring, his foreign minister, is indicative of the seriousness
with which the issue is being dealt with in Dublin.
In Belfast the SDLP, led by Mr John Hume, said: 'This is an integrationist
move, making Northern Ireland similar to Scotland or Wales and ignores the
fact that we have a divided community here, where a large part of the
population consider themselves Irish.'
Hitherto, the British government has professed neutrality in the Anglo-Irish
talks process. A key phrase used by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, and first coined by Mr Peter Brooke, his predecessor, was that
Britain had 'no strategic interest' in Northern Ireland - a phrase which
alarmed Unionists but encouraged nationalists to believe that Downing Street
was genuinely exploring a neutral approach.
Mr Hume has been involved in bilateral talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader
of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The talks have angered
Unionists but Mr Hume says they are aimed at bringing the political violence
to an end.
Unionists accuse Mr Hume, Sinn Fein and Dublin of trying to set up a
'pan-nationalist front'. Although there has been discomfiture in Dublin at
Mr Hume's move, the official government reaction is that 'Mr Hume is an
experienced politician and knows what he is doing'.
According to those close to the Hume-Adams talks, one of Mr Hume's main
arguments has been that the British government's professed neutrality in the
round-table talks and its statement of 'no strategic interest' in the
province, provide the basis for a negotiated end to the political violence.
Significantly, Sinn Fein has substantially moderated its tone over recent
months, and although it still argues that Britain must go one step further
and make a commitment to militarily and politically disengage from Northern
Ireland, it sets no deadline for this as it has in the past and has been
making increasingly conciliatory statements directed towards the Unionists.
Mr Hume's key argument now looks very shaky however, and with it his hopes
of ending the IRA bombing campaign and eventually bringing Sinn Fein into
the peace process.
In private, the republic's officials now talk about playing the US card  -
asking the Clinton administration to appoint a 'peace envoy' to Northern
Ireland. British objections have until now restrained Dublin from pushing
this option.
A further option might be for the republic to ease its 22-year broadcasting
ban on Sinn Fein. This would increase pressure for a review of the similar
ban in the UK.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Update of trademark law back on agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MUCH-DELAYED overhaul of the law on trademarks, intended to simplify and
modernise the system for registering and protecting them, is set to be
brought forward in government legislation this autumn.
The proposals are based on the white paper published in September 1990.
Until now, parliamentary time has not been found for a bill because
ministers have not regarded the policy as a political priority.
It will be the third piece of legislation for next session sponsored by the
Department of Trade and Industry, even though the government's business
managers have sought to curb the number of bills. The DTI's other bills are
the flagship measure on deregulation and the legislation to privatise
British Coal.
The trademark bill has been bounced out of the legislative programme before,
but unless emergency legislation is required on a subject as yet unforeseen,
officials are confident that this time it will make it to the statute book.
It is a sign of the influence wielded by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, that his third priority for legislation should be
included when other measures of a similarly worthwhile but undramatic nature
have been ruled out by the business managers because of lack of time.
Pressing ahead with the move is also intended to strengthen the UK's hand in
its lobbying for London to be the site of the European Community trademark
office. In spite of discussion among EC member states, the office is among
the institutions still awaiting a location, and no agreement is expected for
some time.
The main elements of the bill are expected to be: a more flexible definition
of the kinds of signs that may be treated as trademarks; a presumption that
a mark ought to be registered unless there is some specific objection;
simplified procedures for registering marks with the Trade Marks Registry;
and improved protection for existing trademarks.
The new law will also contain a provision allowing the UK to ratify the
protocol to the Madrid Agreement, an international system for the protection
of trademarks, making it easier for UK trademark owners to obtain protection
in other countries.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Newspaper price war spreads to The Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMES yesterday threatened to extend a newspaper price-cutting war to
the broadsheet end of the market by dropping its price by 15p to 30p from
today in one English county.
The experiment, restricted to the part of Kent outside the M25 London
orbital road, is designed to test the conventional wisdom that price is not
a significant factor in the sales of broadsheet newspapers. The price of the
Saturday edition will also fall, from 50p to 35p.
Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, yesterday said that if the
experiment is successful 'we will either continue it or we will extend it'.
The limited Times price cut is likely to be reviewed in September. It comes
three weeks after The Sun - which, like The Times, is owned by News
International - cut its price nationally by 5p to 20p. The Sun move, which
will be reviewed at the end of the summer, has been a modest success with
sales rising about 7 per cent.
In a very different broadsheet market, Mr Stothard says he has a hunch that
'price may be more important than people conventionally think it is'.
Mr Stothard, who emphasised that he was planning his experiment before The
Sun's price cut, said: 'I think it is important to look occasionally at what
is going on in the market and ask fundamental questions. This is one of
those questions.'
The move comes at a time of circulation decline for all the general
broadsheets. In January The Daily Telegraph sold 1.035m a day, The Guardian
424,028, The Times 370,877 and The Independent 353,198.
By June all had fallen, with The Daily Telegraph on 1.012m although it was
pursuing an aggressive price policy at 48p, The Guardian at 406,627; The
Times 362,428 and The Independent 338,828. The Independent, The Times and
The Guardian all cost 45p.
Mr Stothard, who says his readers write to complain about the price of the
paper, hopes that readers in Kent who do not buy the paper every day will be
encouraged to move to six days a week by the price cut.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent, whose paper could be
most seriously affected by any national cut in The Times's price, declined
to comment last night other than to say: 'We will have to think about it.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / Strategy on jobs 'beats EC rivals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government is 'winning the argument' with its European partners about
how to combat unemployment by reducing employment regulation and increasing
labour flexibility, according to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary.
He was speaking yesterday as the Treasury and his own department released
separate submissions to European Commission reviews of competition and
employment.
The Treasury submission says that improving skills and productivity is not,
as often argued, in conflict with reducing the high cost and strict
regulation of labour. 'On the contrary, if the costs of employment are too
high, profits are reduced and investment in both capital goods and human
skills is held back,' the report states.
'For many unemployed people the chance to return to work is more important
than the nature of the work or its terms and conditions. Temporary or
part-time jobs can be a route back into work, enabling people to move into
more traditional full-time jobs later if they wish,' it continues.
It says that EC labour costs rose by 4 per cent per year during the 1980s
compared with 0 to 1 per cent in the US and Japan. Also, public social
security and healthcare as a proportion of GDP is nearly twice as high in
the EC compared with Japan and more than 60 per cent higher than in the US.
The Treasury strongly rejects the idea that there should be a provision in
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to control the imports of goods
from economies with low labour costs. It recommends instead that the EC
should do more to remove the barriers to enterprise and monitor more
carefully the effects on jobs and competition of all new regulations.
The employment department submission to the Social Affairs Directorate
General's green paper review of employment legislation, due in the autumn,
said that co-operation between member states was usually preferable to
legislation.
Where legislation is necessary it should only be drawn up after much wider
consultation than is customary and should just set a general framework
allowing individual countries to fill in details.

pensions.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Blow for Lloyd's as finance chief quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON, the troubled insurance market, has suffered a fresh blow
with the surprise resignation of Mr David Bruce, its finance director, after
only four months.
News of his departure after only four months in the job emerged yesterday.
Last night Lloyd's offered no explanation but said that Mr Stephen Hall, a
former partner with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, had been appointed
to the vacancy.
Mr Bruce, who is in his mid-40s, was formerly group finance director at
Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank. Before that he was director of finance
and administration at the Stock Exchange.
He was appointed to the post at Lloyd's in March in succession to Mr John
Gaynor. He is one of a new breed of more commercially minded executives
introduced to the Corporation of Lloyd's, which administers and regulates
the Lloyd's market, by Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive, and Mr David
Rowland, the chairman.
Mr Bruce's initial reponsibilities included supervising the attraction of
corporate investors to the market, although within the past six weeks
Lloyd's has appointed another outsider, Mr Ewen Gilmour, to manage this
process under Mr Bruce.
Mr Hall, 60, retired early from Ernst &amp; Young, where he took a close
interest in eastern European privatisations.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Banks trail French on costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH BANKS are the second most efficient in western Europe after the
French in terms of their ratio of costs to income, an analysis of human
resources in banking says. This is because the cost of employing staff
outside Britain is on average 2 1/2 times higher.
The study by the financial services analysis company Lafferty Group finds
that ratio of cost to income per employee in 1990 was 25.3 per cent in
Britain against 22.2 per cent in France. The highest ratio was 41.7 per cent
in Switzer-land and 40.1 per cent in Italy.
The figures are based on data from 400 of the 500 largest banks in 25
European countries. They provide a benchmark for the year when most European
banks were about to embark on cost-reduction programmes to improve staff
efficiency after widespread expansion in the late 1980s.
However, they also disclose wide differentials in the ratios of income,
assets and profits to employees in different countries. Many banks have had
trouble controlling overseas operations and several British banks are this
week expected to report high bad debts on French subsidiaries.
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society achieved one of the lowest
ratio of costs to income per employee in Europe at 14 per cent, being beaten
only by Ippa Bank in Belgium with 11 per cent. The National Bank of Greece
had the highest reported ratio at 70 per cent.
German banks were the most efficient in terms of the size of balance sheets
compared with number of employees. The average German bank held Ecu10.3m
(Pounds 7.77m) in loans per employee, compared with Ecu6.24m in Switzerland
and Ecu2.84m in Britain.
British banks and building societies had the highest proportion of part-time
employees, with Newcastle Building Society having 36.8 per cent part-time
workers compared with an average of 10 per cent among European bank
employees. All but 2 per cent of UK part-timers were women.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Cross-party unity on unemployment urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Hunt, employment secretary, has called for a national consensus
between the main political parties on a strategy for tackling long-term
unemployment.
Mr Hunt, a standard-bearer of the left in the Tory party, said at the
weekend: 'It has now become such an intractable problem that we must find a
way of involving people from across the whole political spectrum. If you can
get a general agreement, it allows you to move away from stale arguments
about resources.'
About a third of the 2.9m unemployed have been out of work for more than a
year, and the proportion is likely to rise even if unemployment as a whole
continues to fall.
Mr Hunt said he had received indications from many people 'across the
political and industrial spectrum' that they would be ready to work with the
government. He would not name individuals, but he has a close rapport with
both Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who is chairman of the Commons' social
security committee, and Mr John Monks, general secretary-elect of the Trades
Union Congress.
Mr Hunt has just returned from a short tour of the US, where he was
promoting inward investment in the UK and looking at workfare schemes, which
require the unemployed to work for their benefit.
He said he had 'reservations' about the element of compulsion in such
schemes and pointed out that the US has a very different, and generally less
generous, benefit system. But he also noted that it was the Democrats, and
not the Republicans, who were now considering introducing a national
workfare scheme. 'I think President Clinton's friends in the Labour party
should take note of that,' he said.
Mr Hunt also reached agreement on funding a joint study of how the US
economy has produced so many new jobs over the past few years. 'Europe has a
lot to learn from the US experience, but it seems that there is no clear
idea in the US as to why they have been so successful,' he said.
The Labour Party does not share Mr Hunt's enthusiasm for the highly
deregulated US labour market, where more than two-thirds of all employees
can be fired at will. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman,
yesterday said that low employment protection and low wages in Britain had
not solved the unemployment problem.

FT  02 AUG 93 / NatWest fined Pounds 10,000 over BES advertisement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank has been fined Pounds 10,000 and ordered to pay
Pounds 3,208 costs by Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management
industry, in connection with misleading advertising for a business expansion
scheme it was promoting.
NatWest was fined by Imro's disciplinary committee on June 29 for an
advertisement which appeared in several national newspapers on March 6 1993,
the public register of disciplinary actions by the self-regulating
organisations shows.
The breach for which the fine was levied is unusual because most BES scheme
promoters consult regulators before issuing advertise-ments.
The advertisement, urging the purchase of shares in the Homeshare (UK)
companies offered under the BES, violated Imro rules which prohibit the use
of specific illustrations or projections of potential returns.
The advertisement, which carried the headline 'How NatWest turns Pounds
6,000 into Pounds 10,800 in five years' promised '11.48 per cent tax-free
for five years'. It told readers that after six months, the implied savings
for higher-rate taxpayers, together with other elements of the investment,
could lead to an annualised return of nearly 30 per cent.
Separately, Imro has fined Waverly Investment Management Pounds 10,000 and
ordered it to pay an additional Pounds 15,000. Waverly bought shares in
companies for which it was engaged in corporate finance activities with the
proceeds of a unit trust it managed.
The corporate finance activities involved the placing of shares which
ultimately were sold to the Australasian Gold Fund Unit Trust managed by
Waverly. Moreover, Waverly failed to inform the trustee of its dual role,
but was in any event not authorised to conduct corporate finance business.
It also failed to meet minimum capital requirements on seven separate
occasions.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Theories behind feel-bad factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS offer varying theories to explain the growing despondence about
unemployment disclosed today in the MORI poll for the Financial Times.
Industrial, international and labour market analysts were asked to explain
why more than half of the 855 people surveyed in July were anxious about
losing their jobs over the next 12 months even though the official
unemployment figure was on a downward trend.
Mr John Philpott, a director of the Employment Policy Institute, an
independent think tank, said: 'People see colleagues losing their jobs and
feel the threat's still there.'
He also pointed out that the 'little period of semi-euphoria' that greeted
last month's good indicators had been replaced with gloom in the media about
the recovery faltering. He said that surveys gauged confidence; and that
confidence was affected by the 'gloss' placed on economic news by the press.
At the heart of people's fears was the fact that their circumstances had not
perceptibly changed since the government declared the recession officially
at an end, he said. Real wages had not gone up.
Mr Angus Armstrong, international economist at investment bank Morgan
Grenfell, said that the gloom and uncertainty was partly caused by the
political 'fiasco' in Britain and concern about the ERM. After the general
election in April last year people expected a sharp turnaround in the UK
economy, and had been disappointed.
The latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry, meanwhile, had
confirmed that after a couple of encouraging early summer months the 'steam
had gone out of demand and activity'.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Midlands councils appeal for EC funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities in the west Midlands are appealing for European Community
regional funding to help regenerate the economy.
The authorities hope both the UK government and the EC will adopt their
strategy in their definition of regional spending policy over the next five
years.
In their document the authorities say EC funding 'has been a mainstay of
urban regeneration policy in the West Midlands'.
But they acknowledge that previous EC funding - more than Pounds 300m since
1988 - failed to make 'any real inroads into combating . . . inner-city
poverty' or to counteract recession. Spending was also often poorly
integrated with local development priorities.
The focus of new spending should be on arresting the decline of
manufacturing, improving communications, helping small and medium-sized
businesses, developing tourism and enhancing research and development
capacity.
The government's new map of areas eligible for regional assistance raise
Birmingham from intermediate to development status, widening the scope of
funding for which companies can apply.

RISING OUTPUT from British industry produced an increase in manufacturing
employment in July for the first time in two years, the latest monthly
survey of purchasing managers shows.
And a Confederation of British Industry quarterly survey today says smaller
manufacturing companies are planning to spend more on plant and machinery in
the next year - the first planned increase in investment for more than four
years.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its overall purchasing
managers' index fell slightly to 53.0 per cent from 53.7 per cent last
month.
But the index, based on a weighted average of movements of several
components, including new orders, output and employment, was still above the
50 per cent level that indicates expansion in the manufacturing economy for
the sixth consecutive month.
The institute, which represents purchasing managers with overall spending
power of Pounds 750bn a year, said its employment index rose above the 50
per cent level to 51.3 per cent in July, indicating expansion. They reported
that the increase was a reaction to rising levels of production.
The output and order components of the index fell slightly in July, although
they remained above 50 per cent, and have indicated rises in manufacturing
activity and new orders for several months.
The output index fell to 56.9 per cent last month from 58.8 per cent in
June, while the new-orders index dropped to 52 per cent from 53.7 per cent.
A breakdown of the new-orders index by industry shows expansion in all
sectors other than chemicals, rubber and plastics processing. There was a
big increase in order levels for office machinery, electrical and instrument
engineering, with a rise in the index from 50 per cent to 60.0 per cent.
The CBI's survey, of 853 manufacturers each employing fewer than 200 people,
adds to recent evidence that small manufacturing companies may be emerging
from the recession faster than larger businesses.
The survey found a small companies planning to increase investment in plant
and machinery in the next year. Although the positive balance was small at 5
percentage points, it was the first positive result since April 1989. It
also shows that employment in small manufacturing companies held steady and
is expected to rise slightly over the next four months.
The survey contrasts with last week's CBI quarterly industrial trends
report, which found investment intentions for all manufacturing industry
still weak and noted further sharp cuts in employment by larger companies.
Today's survey provides hope for hard-pressed suppliers of plant and
machinery such as machine tools. Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI's
Smaller Firms Council, said an increase in plant and machinery investment
was critical for sustaining recovery.
General business confidence and optimism over exports continues but is more
muted than in April. A positive balance of 9 percentage points of smaller
companies are more optimistic than four months ago compared with a positive
balance of 33 points in the last survey.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Insurer launches NHS trust scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW medical insurance plan that provides treatment in National Health
Service trust hospitals rather than the private sector is to be launched
today.
Norwich Union Healthcare estimates that insurance under its Trust Care
scheme will be 25 per cent to 30 per cent cheaper than its full-cover
policies. Trust Care offers many of the regular benefits of health insurance
policies but excludes the use of private hospitals. Patients will instead
receive treatment in private wings of NHS trusts.
The development is likely to alarm the private hospital sector, which is
already concerned that since the 1991 NHS reforms some trust managers have
started encouraging consultants to carry out private practice on NHS
premises rather than in independent hospitals.
Norwich Union's marketing material for the new plan describes it as an
affordable medical insurance policy that has been developed 'in conjunction
with NHS hospitals'.
Mr David Cavers, managing director of Norwich Union Healthcare, said the
scheme would bring 'high-quality medical cover within the reach of
individuals and families who may not have previously considered it', while
generating income for the NHS.
Norwich Union has compiled a list of 'preferred' trust hospitals that have
agreed to provide treatment - normally with single room accommodation - and
settle bills direct with the insurer.
The list contains many of the NHS's best-known hospitals including Guy's-St
Thomas', University College-Middlesex, St Mary's, Royal Brompton, King's
College, Charing Cross, the Royal London and the Great Ormond Street
Hospital for Sick Children in London; Papworth in Cambridge; Leeds General
Infirmary; and the Queen Elizabeth, Birmingham.
Private wings and pay beds have always been a feature of the NHS and since
the introduction of market-based reforms hospital managers have been trying
to increase income by revamping these facilities. But low bed occupancy is a
feature shared by some NHS private wings and independent hospitals. Norwich
Union estimates that bed occupancy in NHS private facilities nationally
averages about 30 per cent.
Mr Ian Robertson, business manager of the Lindo private wing at St Mary's,
Paddington, said that involvement in Trust Care would help to ensure that
the hospital's private facilities were used efficiently while not affecting
the provision of public beds. The scheme would be 'providing care and
comfort comparable with the private sector while channelling funds back into
the hospital'.
The new scheme from Norwich Union, one of the most forceful recent entrants
to the health insurance market, would cost Pounds 19.64 per month for a
27-year-old in Oxford, Pounds 30.65 for a 29-year-old in inner London and
Pounds 64.92 for a typical family.
An NOP Omnibus survey for Norwich Union showed that eight out of 10 people
believed the NHS should be able to generate income from its private
facilities.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Pay slides at small firms of architects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE heads of small architecture practices are suffering more in the building
industry recession than their colleagues in larger firms, earnings figures
today from the Royal Institute of British Architects show, Andrew Baxter
writes.
Earnings of sole principals - the heads of small practices - fell 16 per
cent in the year ended April 1 to a median level of Pounds 15,072. It is the
third consecutive year that sole principals' income has fallen and the
cumulative fall in earnings has been 37 per cent since 1990.
Principals in partnership, working for larger firms, saw median earnings
fall 9 per cent to Pounds 25,489 in 1992-93. Overall, the average earnings
of full-time architects on April 1 was Pounds 23,175 - a 1 per cent rise on
last year's figure but still lower than the 1991 average.
Private-sector in-house architects and those in local government fared
better, with rises in income of 3 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Barrage jolts PM's dream for Lebanon: The battle to rebuild
the nation goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, yesterday itemised the
physical damage to his country wrought by nearly seven days of heavy Israeli
bombardment: 128 people killed, of whom eight he says were Hizbollah
fighters, 470 injured, 300,000 refugees, 10,000 houses in the south
destroyed and 20,000 houses or apartments damaged.
The human cost of the barrage is self-evident. The economic costs are only
now being tallied. The Health Ministry reckons it will cost at least Dollars
25m for immediate humanitarian relief. Mr al-Hariri, who made his
multi-billion dollar fortune in the construction industry, says it will cost
around Dollars 900m to rebuild the broken villages.
This alone, even given the Dollars 500m pledged by Arab League states over
the weekend to be split between reconstruction and strengthening the
Lebanese army, will further burden a country that had just begun to heave
itself towards reconstruction, after a 17-year civil war which ruined
swathes of Beirut, countless villages and itself left perhaps half a million
homeless.
But the greatest immediate cost to Lebanon may be the damage Israel's
bombardment has inflicted on confidence - the most vital ingredient in the
prime minister's eight month old effort to put the country back on its feet.
'Definitely this has jolted confidence in Lebanon,' says Mr Tewfik Mishlawi,
a local journalist, 'and has undermined considerably Hariri's hopes and
ambitions - it's a great blow to him.'
The dream of restoring Beirut, and indeed Lebanon, as a magnet for Middle
Eastern banking and trade, has rested squarely on the hope that other
Lebanese will follow Mr al-Hariri's own fierce belief in his country, which
the businessman-turned-politician is undertaking to back with millions of
his own dollars, and bring themselves and their wealth back home.
This dream, enshrined in Mr al-Hariri's showpiece Dollars 13bn, ten-year,
Horizon 2000 redevelopment project, required faith enough. For a country
with GDP of only Dollars 3.5bn and a budget deficit for the first five
months of this year of Dollars 360m, raising the sums for Horizon 2000
always looked ambitious. There has been some success: international donors
have already pledged Dollars 1.35bn towards specific projects and, as a sign
that diaspora Lebanese have begun to repatriate their wealth, private
deposits in local banks have risen 13 per cent in the past five months.
But even before Israel's bombardment, some Lebanese investors and
contractors were starting to grumble about the pace of progress. 'It's
really a lot slower than I expected,' says Mr Jo Mehtar, one Lebanese
engineer who returns from 15 years' exile in the US to set up a construction
company to exploit the rebuilding programme. 'I've achieved 20 per cent of
what I thought I would.'
Mr al-Hariri, however, remains undaunted. 'Yes, the rebuilding programme has
been delayed,' he said in an interview. 'By exactly one week.' And he seeks
to deflect the suggestion that the seven-day bombardment might have
shattered confidence, by arguing that Lebanon's political resilience in the
face of it demonstrated a new national unity. 'If this had happened two
years ago,' he says, 'the country would have fallen apart. Now we have a
government where all the Lebanese are behind it.'
Indeed, the manner in which the country united in opposition to the raids,
and in its efforts to deal with the humanitarian crisis, surprised and
impressed even local commentators. Christian and Moslem-owned news media
stood firmly behind the government throughout the crisis, while Christian
activists raised money for the Moslem refugees. 'There is a great sense of
unity,' says Mr Mishlawi, 'in contrast to the 1982 Israeli invasion.'
This unity, however, is a modest, albeit necessary, starting point for
Lebanon's mammoth remaining task. And the past eight days have spotlighted
more starkly than ever the extent to which success in rebuilding the country
will depend ultimately on the broader success of Middle East peace talks.
Hizbollah's attacks into Israel, the pretext for Israel's resulting
collective punishment of the south, occurred outside the control of
Lebanon's government. It also took days of talks in Damascus, under US
pressure, between Iran and Syria, Hizbollah's sponsors, to win an
'understanding' that there would be no further rocket attacks into Israel.
'All we have seen in the last few days is a proxy war between Israel and
Syria,' says one political analyst, 'fighting to the last Lebanese.'
Mr al-Hariri acknowledges that his dream for Lebanon depends finally on
reaching a durable Middle East peace. But he refuses to believe that in its
absence investors will fight shy of the country. 'There are people also who
take risks,' he says. 'And I have a lot of friends - don't forget my
background.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / 'Security zone' withdrawal seen as way to peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IF Israel's aim was to destroy Hizbollah with its seven-day bombardment,
then it failed, according to Mr Rafik al-Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister.
He said the only way to end any threat from the pro-Iranian group was for
Israel to commit itself to withdraw from its self-declared 'security zone'
in south Lebanon.
After such a commitment, and even before actual withdrawal, Lebanon and
Israel could set up a joint security committee for the south and address the
question of security in north Israel, Mr al-Hariri said.
In an interview with the FT, he said: 'The Israelis give us two options,'
adding: 'Either we disarm Hizbollah and risk entering into a civil war
because Israel is still occupying the country, or Israel destroys our
country. But there is a third option - that they commit to withdraw from
south Lebanon, then there will be no need for resistance against them.'
Mr al-Hariri's remarks follow government statements that it could not act
against Hizbollah while the group had the legitimising 'political cover' of
Israel's presence in the 15km 'security zone' in south Lebanon. Neither,
officials said, could the government publicly oppose any acts of resistance
against Israeli targets within that zone.
The government is aware it must do nothing to risk reigniting the sectarian
fighting that consumed the country in its 17-year civil war. But officials
understand the threat Hizbollah poses both to the Middle East peace process
and, potentially also, to the newly united Lebanese government itself.
The government believes, however, that a strengthened Lebanese army could
contain any threat of attacks against northern Israel, but only if the
Israelis commit themselves to withdraw.
Under the ceasefire 'understanding' that silenced Israeli guns on Saturday,
Hizbollah has apparently undertaken to cease Katyusha rocket attacks into
Israeli territory - the pretext for Israel's bombardment. Hizbollah will
also be restrained by the knowledge that further attacks would bring a
powerful Israeli reprisal which could, in turn, draw considerable hostility
against them from the thousands of refugees now streaming back to their
battered villages.
Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, has clearly been decisive in
obtaining the ceasefire 'understanding', under what appears to have been
considerable US pressure.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Israel's hopes rise after ceasefire deal: Agreement to end
bombardment may help revive Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S government was quick yesterday to claim success for its seven-day
bombardment of southern Lebanon aimed at curbing rocket attacks by Arab
guerrillas against the country's northern towns.
However, as Israel continued withdrawing tanks and troops from its
self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon after a US-arranged ceasefire
at the weekend, Israeli politicians and military officials were left
wondering how solid any gains will be in the long term.
Despite severe international condemnation and the threats posed to the
already stalled Middle East peace process by Israel's devastating onslaught
against Lebanese civilians, optimistic Israeli politicians and analysts
believe they can turn the crisis into an opportunity.
Much depends on the details of the secret deal arranged by Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, and the reaction of Arab states to
Israel's latest military action during Mr Christopher's current visit to the
region.
For its part, Israel believes the unwritten agreement involving Syria,
Lebanon and Israel can pave the way to a more permanent and durable solution
in the Middle East.
What is known about the deal is that Israel has ceased its offensive in
return for vague assurances that Syria will rein in the pro-Iranian
Hizbollah guerrillas and Lebanon will increasingly restrict the Islamic
militia - demonstrated yesterday as the Lebanese army mounted increased
checkpoints on roads into the south, stopping cars carrying armed Hizbollah.
But the agreement does not provide for the disarming of Hizbollah or an end
to their attacks against Israeli troops and their proxies in the security
zone and so leaves the underlying security issues unresolved.
In the short term Israel claims it has stopped Katyusha rocket attacks from
Hizbollah and has committed the governments of Lebanon and Syria to restrict
Hizbollah's ability to launch further attacks.
For their part, Lebanon and Syria have halted a military onslaught that
threatened to destabilise Lebanon and derail the considerable gains made by
the nine-month-old Lebanese government towards a restoration of law and
order, security and economic rehabilitation.
It is also immediately clear that the hand of President Hafez al-Assad of
Syria has been strengthened. Last week US President Bill Clinton praised
'Syrian restraint' during the Israeli operation and even Israeli leaders
have softened to the man who has been their enemy for more than a quarter of
a century.
Gen Ehud Barak, chief of staff, said: 'President Assad is a tough and bitter
rival but we can't ignore the fact that he is a very serious, responsible
and highly reliable leader.'
The new-found Israeli praise for Mr Assad has fuelled speculation that the
ceasefire agreement could have deeper aims than merely stopping the latest
conflict and be the start of a broader agreement capable of reviving the
moribund Middle East peace process. Certainly this is Israel's hope.
'This is a deal which is the first of its kind between the triangle of
Israel, Syria and Lebanon,' said Mr Evyatar Manor, foreign ministry
spokesman. 'If it holds, it can create an atmosphere of wheeling and dealing
between the three sides which could break the deadlock in the talks.'
But the deeper details of the deal remain obscure. Israeli commentators
believe Mr Assad has extracted a price for his 'restraint' which involves,
as a minimum, a US promise to consider favourably removing Syria from the
blacklist of countries which support terrorism - opening the way to US
finance and investment.
After 20 months of talks the peace process remains deadlocked and each side
accuses the other of stalling. Israel says Mr Christopher will focus his
visit on how to unblock this deadlock and use the unwritten ceasefire
agreement as a springboard to speed up Syria-Lebanon-Israel talks.
Israel hopes that Mr Christopher will have emerged with enhanced status by
chalking up his first success as a peace broker in the Middle East and that
he will step up US involvement in the peace process, make bolder initiatives
and bring all sides closer to an agreement.
Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said the ceasefire agreement deal
should be conducive to peace because Mr Christopher had opened new channels
of communication between leaders in the region.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAI law forbidding prostitution is probably the least-enforced act in
the world. But even in Bangkok it is unusual for 30 government members of
parliament to be caught on the same night consorting with women of doubtful
virtue - especially during an official campaign against the sex trade.
In the last two days the Thai press has reported with relish on an
end-of-term 'bachelor' party held for MPs from the New Aspiration party in
Bangkok's Emerald Hotel last Wednesday; the host was Mr Boonchu Trithong, a
deputy finance minister and deputy NAP leader.
The revelations have been denied by some of the embarrassed MPs - who
described the girls variously as 'artists', 'singers' and 'actresses' - but
they have hardly stunned the nation.
Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the NAP leader who was not at the party,
described the women as singers rather than prostitutes, but did not dispel
the notion that it was normal for MPs to cavort with prostitutes. 'Had they
been prostitutes, the party would have been held secretly,' he said.
The publicity is particularly embarrassing for the five-party coalition
government because it has campaigned against prostitution, although the
emphasis has been on protecting children used in the trade.
Earlier this month, the government banned the latest edition of Longman's
Dictionary of English Language and Culture because it described Bangkok as
being known for both its Buddhist temples and its prostitutes. The only
comfort for the government is that opposition MPs are unlikely to have
spotless records.
Thai women's organisations have pointed out that it is useless for the
government to try to improve the country's tarnished image if government
officials are themselves involved in prostitution.

A CEASEFIRE signed a week ago to end Liberia's civil war came into effect
successfully at midnight on Saturday, a West African military force officer
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Monrovia.
'All sides seem to be observing the ceasefire. I think everybody is fed up
with the fighting,' said Mr John Addah, deputy field commander of Ecomog,
the joint west African military force.
Mr Addah said some fighters of Mr Charles Taylor's rebel National Patriotic
Front for Liberia (NPFL) had tried to surrender at Ecomog lines in the
Buchanan area, south-east of Monrovia.
'We told them to go back to their positions until we set the process of
disarmament in motion. We want them to be able to benefit from the
rehabilitation programme,' he said.
In a speech to the nation interim President Amos Sawyer said: 'The guns of
war in the Liberian crisis are silent for ever.' The NPFL's radio station
urged fighters to return to their homes and rebuild their lives.
More than 150,000 people have been killed in three and a half years of
warfare, according to the United Nations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON of the US and China Light and Power, the Hong Kong utility company,
have been accused of withholding crucial information from a Hong Kong
government investigation into an explosion at their jointly-owned Castle
Peak power station. The allegations were made in a USDollars 125m (Pounds
83.8m) legal action filed in Texas.
They are alleged to have removed 'vital evidence from the scene of the
explosion', and to have held back a detailed internal report which had
suggested 'inadequate and improper maintenance and training' at the plant.
The explosion of two hydrogen cylinders at the plant last August killed two
workers. A coroner's verdict of accidental death was given, but the latest
allegations could lead to a reopening of the inquest.
Mr John Leigh, CLP's company secretary, said yesterday in an official
statement that the allegations were 'without merit'. However, he said the
Castle Peak Power Company (Capco), which is 60 per cent owned by Exxon and
40 per cent by CLP, intended to consult the attorney-general.
The lawsuit has been filed in Alice, Texas, by Mr Michael Ford, a Hong
Kong-based barrister who represented Capco at the coroner's inquest.
Mr Ford is suing Capco and five Exxon group companies, claiming damage to
his reputation, loss of income and emotional distress after he was dismissed
during the inquest. If successful, this could trigger further legal action
by the widows of the two men who died in the accident.
Mr Ford alleges he was instructed to hold back relevant material from the

TWO former South Korean defence ministers have been indicted for allegedly
accepting bribes in connection with military contracts.
The indictments followed a recent investigation by the government's Board of
Audit and Inspection (BAI) into military procurement, which was conducted as
part of the new civilian government's anti-corruption campaign.
Mr Lee Jong-koo and Mr Lee Sang-hoon, both former military generals, served
as defence ministers in the previous government of President Roh Tae-woo.
General Han Chu-sok, a former air force chief of staff, was also indicted on
bribery charges.
Six executives were fined Won1m (Pounds 823) each for giving bribes to the
officials. They include Mr Chung Mong-koo, the chairman of Hyundai Precision
&amp; Industry and a son of the founder of the Hyundai group, Korea's largest
conglomerate.
Mr Chung is alleged to have bribed officials for contracts associated with
the Korean K-1 tank, which is produced by his company.
Other businessmen fined included the vice-chairman of Korean Air and an
adviser to Samsung Aerospace Industries.
The BAI probe was linked to efforts by President Kim Young-sam to curb the
power of the military, which formerly ruled the country.
Nineteen senior officers were recently purged for their role in the 1979
coup. Several former military chiefs also face charges of accepting bribes
in return for granting promotions.
It is widely believed, however, that military corruption was more widespread
than that unearthed by the BAI. But its investigation was limited in scope
because President Kim did not want to alienate the military further.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Leopard skin king must walk a tightrope: Heavy is Londoner's
crown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEOPARD skin had definitely seen better days. Now, splayed under the
throne of the future king of Buganda, the tired carcass was stubbornly
refusing to bare its fangs.
As the crown prince approached, hoisted on the shoulders of his subjects,
the court attendants abandoned their struggle with the leopard's jaws and
rushed to prostrate themselves before Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, formerly of
Shoreditch, London, who on Saturday was crowned the 36th Kabaka (king) of
Buganda.
For a one-time double-glazing salesman who lived most of his life in
Britain, Ronnie was bearing up well to the rituals of his ancient African
kingdom. After visiting his father's mummified umbilical cord, and leading
his army into battle before dawn, the Kabaka was bathed in the seclusion of
a hut of papyrus reeds.
Then, propelled by thousands of delirious subjects, Ronnie was carried up
the slopes of Buddo hill to a spot marked by the gnarled roots of a sacred
tree, where his ancestors had been crowned for the past 600 years.
As Queen Elizabeth II could have warned him, the duties of a monarch can be
onerous. So, too, were the offerings now hoisted upon the Kabaka under the
sweltering morning sun. Over his white tunic went four togas made of bark
cloth. A cow hide on his back would ensure food for his people. A leopard
skin on his chest would give him valour. Two spears and a shield for those
troublesome little wars and a calabash of water to quench his thirst.
The royal paraphernalia was topped by a sequined crown, which appeared to
double as a fly-whisk. At 9.55am, Ronnie rose to beat a sonorous royal drum.
The crowd went wild. His reign had begun.
The 4m Baganda, Uganda's largest tribe, are celebrating the restoration of
their monarchy after a 27-year ban as the event of the century.
Ronnie's father, Muteesa II, who was also independent Uganda's first
president, was forced into exile in 1966 by Milton Obote, the ambitious
prime minister who became Uganda's uncrowned dictator. Muteesa II, known as
King Freddie to his friends, died in alcoholic penury in Britain three years
later.
'Since then,' says Wasswa Birigwa, a coffee trader who is the royal chief of
protocol, 'we have been like children lost in a forest.'
But he explains: 'We Baganda are rediscovering our traditions. The
Kabakaship is our cultural reservoir.'
President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, agreed to
restore the Kabaka and Uganda's three other tribal kingdoms after long
negotiations which carefully circumscribed the role of kings to cultural and
ceremonial functions.
But many in the royal entourage are already suffering from delusions of
grandeur. Birigwa, the protocol chief, sees the establishment of a permanent
royal court and an executive office staffed by 'managers, financiers and
lawyers' that would execute the king's policies.
The Kabaka, he points out, will soon come into hundreds of acres of royal
land and buildings that were confiscated under Obote's rule.
The Kabaka's income, he says, could be used to spearhead national self-help
and development as well as the standard royal favourites: charities, widows
and orphans.
King Ronnie, however, will be walking a political tightrope. There are many
nostalgic Baganda who would like to use the Kabaka as a rallying figure for
a secessionist movement. Diplomatically, the king says he has no wish to
interfere in politics.
President Museveni was the guest of honour amid the hundreds of invited
dignitaries, African princes, scarlet-robed bishops and minor British
nobility that made up Saturday's colourful medieval pageant.
He watched the proceedings in silence. Some believe Museveni consented to
the restoration of the Kabakaship to placate the Baganda, many of whom
fought alongside his guerrillas in the bush war that ousted Obote. A
contented Baganda, the sceptics argue, are less likely to clamour for
multi-party democracy.
But the jubilation on Saturday was genuine. As princesses ululated and
shimmied to the beat of royal drums, and a cheering crowd carried Mutebi II
away, one clan elder remembered the silent president.
'Museveni,' he hailed at the top of his voice, 'without you we would never
have had our kingdom back. May you rule 100 years.' It was the first time
the president smiled.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Babangida set to delay handover: Transition to democracy
likely to be postponed again in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NIGERIA's President Ibrahim Babangida looks set to remain in office beyond
the promised August 27 handover to civilian rule.
At a weekend meeting in Abuja, the federal capital, with officials of the
country's two political parties it was decided that plans to re-run
presidential elections by that date were not feasible, and a new interim
government would be established.
Although no official announcement has been made, the decision seems likely
to prolong the transition to democracy for the fourth time in three years.
It will also extend a period of strained international relations and means
further delay in efforts to reschedule the country's external debt of
Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22.1bn) and resolve its balance of payments crisis.
Western governments have already imposed visa restrictions and reduced
military links with the Nigerian government in response to the annulment of
June's presidential poll.
At the Abuja meeting the two army-created political parties agreed to take
part in an interim government which will replace the Transitional Council, a
group of civilians appointed by the president to assist in the handover to
democratic rule due on August 27. They will form a joint committee with some
of Gen Babangida's senior military personnel, including the intelligence
chief Brigadier-General Halilu Akilu, Lt-Gen Aliyu Mohammed, the head of
national security, and Brig John Shagaya, an influential field commander in
the north.
'We should. . . see the interim government as a consensus arrangement for
concluding the transitional agenda of this administration, which was
disrupted by the imperative need to nullify the June 12 presidential
elections,' Gen Babangida said.
Details of the new government, including its tenure, will be worked out by
Vice-President Augustus Aikhomu, officials of the two parties and Mr Ernest
Shonekan, who heads a transitional council installed in January and
responsible for day-to-day administration.
Significantly, Gen Babangida did not reaffirm his previous commitment to
step down on August 27. 'We are still in an endless transition to civil
rule,' commented House of Representatives member Tokumbo Afikuyomi: 'It's
like Jesus Christ's second coming. Promised for so long but no-one except
the Lord knows when it will happen.'
The president's decision could lead to a split in the Social Democratic
party (SDP) between those who are co-opted in the coalition and the
supporters of Mr Moshood Abiola, the successful candidate in the June
elections.
Mr Abiola has so far rejected the interim government and claimed that only
he has any mandate to rule in Nigeria. He enjoys strong popular support in
Lagos and most of southern Nigeria.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Lock-out threat dropped at Hyundai shipyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFRONTATION at South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries, the world's
largest shipyard, was averted at the weekend as the company dropped its
threat to lock out 18,000 striking workers.
Labour-management negotiations will resume on Friday after workers take
their annual one-week summer holiday.
The government had hoped to end the two-month long industrial dispute at
Hyundai, South Korea's biggest conglomerate, by the end of July.
The Hyundai strikes have been blamed for helping to plunge the current
account into a Dollars 591m (Pounds 396.6m) deficit in June after it posted
a Dollars 293m surplus in May.
This was chiefly due to reduced motor vehicle exports resulting from a
strike at Hyundai Motor. That dispute ended on July 23.
HHI is the largest of four Hyundai subsidiaries still on strike. The union
is seeking a pay increase above the 4.7 per cent rise offered by management
and demanding the reinstatement of fired union leaders.
The strike at HHI has cost the group Dollars 125m in lost sales.
Workers at Hyundai Wood Industries are locked out, while a similar threat
faces Hyundai Construction Equipment. The union at Hyundai Electrical
Engineering rejected a proposed pay accord on Saturday.

GENERAL MOTORS of the US has signed a letter of intent with Taiwan's
Economics Ministry to help develop the island's car industry, Reuter reports
from Taipei.
The pact calls for GM and Taiwanese partners jointly to promote overseas
markets and upgrade the capability of local car component manufacturers.
The pact is the fifth such agreement on a strategic alliance signed by
Taipei, Mr Yang Shih Chien, Taiwan's vice-economics minister, said at a news
conference at the weekend.
Taiwan's car market has been growing because of the booming economy, with
domestic car and truck production totalling 420,000 in 1992 compared with
390,000 in 1991.
General Motors has a five-year agreement with Taiwan's Chinese Automobile Co
(CAC), announced earlier, under which CAC assembles Opel-Astra sedans on
behalf of GM for Taiwan's domestic market.
Production started last month and monthly output is between 800 and 1,000
cars. This will jump to 2,000 in early 1994, CAC said. CAC has invested
USDollars 45m (Pounds 30.2m) in the project, he added.
General Motors has also invested more than Dollars 7.5m in local vehicle
parts factories making some components for the Opel-Astras, CAC said.

POLICE moved against a strike by India's 1.8m truckers yesterday, arresting
10 leaders at the start of a protest against transport taxes, Reuter reports
from New Delhi.
The Press Trust of India reported that police in the eastern state of Orissa
arrested the leaders at their homes, while others went underground to evade
arrest.
Orissa authorities have declared illegal the indefinite strike, which
started at midnight on Saturday.
Under special powers, India's state governments can force drivers to carry
essential supplies. Refusal could mean six months imprisonment and a fine.
Rajasthan and Gujarat are two other states which have banned the strike. No
arrests have been reported there.
The truckers have vowed to immobilise all freight until New Delhi agrees to
abolish road and inter-state taxes.
The arrests, ahead of another round of discussions planned between truckers
and government officials, were likely to harden the strikers' stand.
The strike has been organised by the All India Motor Transport Congress.

FT  02 AUG 93 / E Europe 'should focus more on bilateral trade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergent economies of central and eastern Europe (CEEC) and the European
Free Trade Association countries should make less of their 'EC-mania', and
focus more instead on their increasingly important bilateral relationship, a
leading trade economist argues in a paper published last week.*
This relationship is likely to account for a quarter of their trade growth
in the decade ahead,the economist says.
Mr Richard Baldwin, professor of economics at the Institut Universitaire des
Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva, acknowledges that the sheer size
and proximity of the European Community means it is likely to remain the
main magnet for trade growth in the decade ahead for the Efta and eastern
European countries. But he predicts that double-digit import growth in the
eastern European economies could soon mean they account for 20 per cent of
Efta's exports to the enlarged Europe - and vice versa.
For the CEEC, the sum of exports to Efta countries and trade within the CEEC
area is forecast eventually to account for about half of all their trade. He
notes that the 100m people living in the CEEC area already have a combined
GDP almost as large as the GDP of Efta's 32m population.
As a result, he calls for an eastern enlargement of Efta as being in the
interests of both Efta and CEEC exporters - and preferable to early EC
entry, where he notes 'the economic and political marginalisation implicit
in the bilateral trade deals signed with western Europe'.
He also warns that the explosive growth of the CEEC for western Europe's
exporters cannot continue indefinitely without more openings for their
exports. This is endorsed by the Amex bank in its latest review, which notes
that a 25 per cent jump in CEEC exports to the EC (from Dollars 3bn to
Dollars 4bn a year) 'would have little impact on the EC, accounting for just
0.2 per cent of EC imports'.
Mr Baldwin predicts that Efta exports to the CEEC have the potential to grow
at more than 10 per cent a year 'for decades'. Assuming the CEEC can reach
an average GDP per capita equivalent to 70 per cent of the EC average by the
year 2020, he says their economies will grow at least twice as fast as those
of the EC.
For Efta countries, export growth to the region will be four times faster
than export growth to the EC: 'While the base on which this growth is taking
place is fairly small compared to exports to western Europe, the rates are
so much higher that the CEEC markets are estimated to be an important source
of Efta export growth.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / How Lopez agonised over rival tugs on his heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLOT of the all-action espionage drama involving two of the world's top
automotive groups seemed in danger at the weekend of dissolving into a
tear-jerker.
According to a meticulous diary of events kept by Mr Jens Neumann,
Volkswagen's personnel director, on March 13 he phoned Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, who, four days earlier, had signed a contract to join VW from
General Motors.
Mr Lopez was not at home, he was told. But then he came to the phone to
explain that four GM directors had just left. They had begged him to stay
because otherwise General Motors would go bust and 400,000 families would
lose their jobs. 'He said he was prepared to stay; he asked Mr Piech to
forgive him; he was a broken man,' according to extracts from Mr Neumann's
diary.
His notes were presented in evidence last week to Darmstadt prosecutors
investigating GM's suspicions of industrial spying against Mr Lopez, and
released by VW at the weekend. While the parts of his evidence published
threw no light on the burning issue of whether Mr Lopez and his associates
systematically plundered the US group's secrets before joining VW, they
illuminated the bizarre tug-of-war which preceded the spying charges.
Mr Neumann's notes contain the only points of detail so far to emerge on
which evidence from the two sides does not clash substantially.
On the evidence of the extracts, Mr Jack Smith, GM president, was fighting
to keep Mr Lopez even as the US group announced that he was to leave. At
11.30am on March 12, Mr Lopez called Mr Neumann to say Mr Smith had turned
on the emotional pressure, allegedly saying he would be sacked if he let the
Basque engineer go to Germany.
According to raw notes taken on Saturday March 13 by Mr Lopez's former PR
aide, Ms Toni Simonetti, and read out in a Hamburg court recently, Mr Lopez
was visited in Detroit on the evening of Friday, March 12, by Mr Smith, Mr
Richard Wagoner, finance director, and Mr Harry Pearce, GM's legal brain.
They 'spoke to me like a father and two brothers. . . we made a mistake not
to understand your vision. . . we want to learn from our mistakes. . . that
broke my heart,' Mr Lopez said, according to Ms Simonetti's notes. They
continued: 'A different GM first ever the big company can have soul warm and
can love for each other ..'
Mr Lopez has repeatedly denied dictating these words, intended for a speech
due to be delivered on Monday, March 15, to explain to GM employees why he
had, after all, decided to stay in the US.
Back in Mr Neumann's diary, an entry timed at 11.00am on the day Ms
Simonetti allegedly took down the outline speech, Mr Lopez was on the phone
to Germany again. He had told Mr Smith there was no way back, he could not
leave VW in the lurch. 'The word of a Basque cannot be broken'.
After another call at 4.30pm the same day, when Mr Lopez had apparently
broken, changed his mind again and asked for the VW chairman's forgiveness,
there were two more calls in which Mr Lopez was offered and accepted a
compromise from Mr Piech. He could stay at GM, and join VW in a year.
On Sunday March 14, the vacillating Basque called Mr Neumann. He would try
to set GM to rights within a year and then reconsider his position. He had
not slept for four nights, he said. He was back on the line the next day.
The US group wanted to lock him into a five-year contract as president of GM
North America, but his 'heart and mind belonged to Germany, and he had a
clear vision for Europe,' according to Mr Neumann.
Within minutes, Mr Piech was on the phone to his 'very unhappy'
director-to-be. 'This strengthened his resolve to fly to Germany today. He
needs him now,' the notes said. Half an hour later Mr Lopez and his family
were on the way to the airport.
Mr Neumann's published extracts ended: 'March 16, 1993, 10am: I collect Mr
Lopez from Braunschweig airport and bring him to the supervisory board
meeting which has already started.'
In Detroit, on the advice of Mr Pearce, the office of the Basque had been
searched in vain for secret documents. The fruitless hunt was under way for
more papers, pictures and files, alleged to have been assembled by his
closest colleagues. The spying drama was about to begin.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Nafta foes campaign on a shoestring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the 'Perotistas'
supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The site of the signing ceremony in
Sacramento sent a warning to the city's congressman, Mr Bob Matsui, one of
the leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives.
In Washington state, Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner
given for Mr Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy US Trade Representative. These featured
the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes
a reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US.
Anti-Nafta crusaders drove caravans through Tennessee, California and Texas
to mobilise opposition. Equipped as information centres, the vans cruised
from town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation
in Mexico.
With just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds
134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mount
a massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.
Nafta's US proponents - mostly the business community - are spending
millions, bypassing the voters, to convince Congress to pass Nafta.
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week showed 31 per cent of all
Americans in favour of the pact, a slight increase from previous surveys,
while 29 per cent are opposed. However, 63 per cent believe Nafta will cost
US jobs.
Although the Clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a 'Nafta
czar' to shepherd the pact through Congress, it has yet to announce it has
found anyone to take on the task. By contrast, the opposition has an
'anti-Nafta czar' in place and making speeches around the country.
He is Mr Jim Jontz, a former Indiana congressman. Nafta foes have pooled
their meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field
legislative directors. Forty-one states have been organised, and every two
weeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies.
Nafta foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman
to back away from support of the deal. One California gubernatorial hopeful,
Ms Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalked
by demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.
According to Mr Craig Merrilees, director of California's Fair Trade
Campaign, Ms Brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest
of the state's Democratic establishment.
With the expected conclusion this week of the talks over side agreements on
labour and environment, both sides are preparing to crank up their lobbying
efforts.
The opposition is not awaiting an announcement of the details, said Ms Lori
Wallach, one of the opposition's leaders. The side pacts will be 'silly,'
she said, 'It's the same old Bush Nafta with the supplementals used to
create a fig-leaf.'

Israel's Supreme Court, after clearing Mr John Demjanjuk last week of being
Nazi death camp guard 'Ivan the Terrible', blocked his deportation to
Ukraine yesterday while considering if he can stand trial for other war
crimes, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
A five-judge court acquitted Mr Demjanjuk.
Yesterday a separate three-judge panel, acting on a complaint by two
Israelis, gave government prosecutors seven days to show why Mr Demjanjuk
should not be investigated anew based on allegations that he was a guard at
other Nazi camps.
'The discussion will resume in 10 days. In seven days the attorney-general
will submit his arguments, and he won't be deported until then,' presiding
judge Mr Shlomo Levin said.
A former car worker, Mr Demjanjuk was stripped of his US citizenship in 1981
for concealing his wartime activities when he entered America and moved to
Cleveland, Ohio, after the second world war.
He was extradited to Israel in 1986 and still hopes to regain his US
citizenship over objections by the Justice Department.

<TEXT>
One of Venezuela's two leading candidates for the presidency warned at the
weekend that the country was moving close to another military uprising,
Joseph Mann reports from Caracas.
The statement, made by Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, candidate for the Christian
Democrat Copei party, came after two weeks of rising tensions in Venezuela
caused by a rash of bombings in the capital, press reports of a stillborn
military rebellion and new rumours of military discontent.
The most recent bombing took place on Saturday when an explosion damaged the
headquarters of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest association of industry,
commerce and finance. Incidents up to now have involved relatively small
explosive devices.
The authorities have not identified the terrorists, but government officials
say that unidentified 'extremists' are attempting to create political
instability and block national elections scheduled for next December.
Venezuela, which has endured more than two years of political and social
turmoil, including two coups attempts in 1992, has enjoyed a period of
relative calm since Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez took over as president on June
5.

AT LEAST 30 people were killed in a South African township clash,
overshadowing efforts to woo black and white conservatives back to democracy
talks, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Residents and police said fighting began when hostel dwellers, most of them
members of the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom party, attacked nearby homes.
Street battles raged on for most of Saturday night, resulting in the death
of at least 30. A family of four, including a five-month-old baby, perished.
Tembisa residents, most of them supporters of the African National Congress,
said the attack was unprovoked.
The violence flared as the ANC and the government were making last-ditch
efforts to get Inkatha, the KwaZulu homeland and the pro-apartheid
Conservative party back to democracy talks.
The three groups, which seek virtual autonomy in a post-apartheid South
Africa, walked out of the talks three weeks ago, accusing the ANC and the
government of trying to push the country into an election before agreement
was reached on the future form of the state and violence had been curbed.
More than 530 have died since negotiators confirmed the April 27, 1994
election date.

   THE DEATH of King Baudouin has plunged Belgium into mourning
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and produced surprise over the choice of his successor.
The 62-year-old king, a devout Catholic who briefly abdicated in 1990 rather
than sign Belgium's law legalising abortion, died from a heart attack on
Saturday while on holiday in Spain with his Spanish-born wife, Queen
Fabiola.
After a cabinet meeting to discuss funeral and succession arrangements, Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, yesterday flew to Spain to
accompany the king's body back to Brussels.
Last night, the government announced that the king's 59-year-old brother
Prince Albert of Liege would succeed to the throne and become the sixth king
of the Belgians. Until the last minute the succession was open. Prince
Albert is next in line for the throne but had been widely expected to
renounce his right in favour of his 33-year-old son, Prince Philippe.
Philippe had been groomed as the heir apparent, but he is shy and unmarried.
Talk that the throne might pass to his married sister, Astrid, was prompted
by the 1991 change to the Belgian constitution allowing a woman to become
monarch.
Belgium's proportional voting system and linguistic divide between
French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemish give its monarchs more
than just a figurehead role. Belgian elections seldom throw up a clear
winner, and it falls to the monarch to decide which party leader should try
to form a coalition government. This must be linguistically as well as
politically balanced.
King Baudouin played this role in an exemplary fashion. With the growing
tendency of his countrymen to identify themselves as primarily Walloons or
Flemish, or indeed Bruxellois, the bilingual monarch often came to be seen
as the only real Belgian left holding the country together. He was concerned
at the outset about reforms which in recent years have devolved much
political and economic power to the country's two regions - Flanders and
Wallonia - and to its capital of Brussels.
However, the king praised in his National Day address on July 21 this year
'the democratic and peaceful way' in which Belgium had become a federal
state.
He went on to argue forcefully for 'a federal Europe', and his championing
of European integration was yesterday praised by Mr Jacques Delors, the
European Commission president.
But the tall, stooping, bespectacled Baudouin was often dubbed the 'sad
king' in a reign that got off to a shaky start. The standing of his father,
Leopold III, never recovered from his controversial decision to stay with
his people in May 1940 and surrender to the Germans, against the advice of
his government which escaped to London. Faced with strikes and riots in
Belgium, Leopold abdicated in 1951 in favour of his 21-year-old son.
Nine years later, Baudouin married Fabiola, a Spanish aristocrat, avoiding
as his ancestors had done Belgium's linguistic jealousies by wedding a
foreigner. But Fabiola suffered three miscarriages and they never had
children.
In 1990, he said he could not in conscience sign a bill legalising abortion.
To his critics, mainly on the left, who argued that the king had a duty to
sign any bill which the parliament had passed, he wrote in an anguished
letter to the parliament: 'Does freedom of conscience apply to everyone
except the king?'
In the event, the Belgian government allowed him to step down for a day so
that the abortion bill could pass into law without his approv al.
At the time, it was said the king's abdication-for-a-day would weaken
permanently the monarchy's position. But most Belgians even those who did
not share his views on abortion, seemed to appreciate the king more after
his moral gesture.

THE anti-trust division of the US Justice Department is to review documents
relating to the business practices of Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, following the failure of the Federal Trade
Commission to agree on the case after a three-and-a-half year investigation.
The move represents a setback for Microsoft because it had appeared that the
FTC was hopelessly deadlocked on the issue and that the investigation might
soon end. The company declined to comment.
The review also moves the issue into the political arena and could test the
Clinton administration's tougher stance on anti-trust enforcement. If the
Justice Department finds evidence of anti-competitive activity, it will have
to decide whether the public interest is served by taking action against one
of the most successful high technology companies in the US.
The Justice Department will review the thousands of documents amassed by the
FTC.
Microsoft's competitors allege that the company has attempted to raise false
concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly
with operating system programs sold by competitors.
Microsoft has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE investigation of General Motors' spying allegations made against senior
Volkswagen employees will enter a decisive stage this week with the expected
return to Germany of key witnesses.
Public prosecutors will be able to step up their questioning and are
expected soon to call Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former global
purchasing director, and three associates who GM says systematically
plundered industrial secrets from the US group and its European subsidiaries
before defecting to VW in March.
The four former GM employees and most of their VW colleagues have been away
during the traditional works holiday period.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the German concern's chairman, will also press his
initiative for background talks with Mr Jack Smith, president of GM, without
prejudice to the legal case, VW said.
Mr Piech, who made contact last week in what was seen as a damage limitation
exercise, will telephone Mr Smith again today or tomorrow, VW said.
The VW chairman's public attack on GM last week, hinting at a conspiracy to
pervert the course of justice, was widely criticised as ill judged. It
sparked appeals for 'moderate language' from government ministers concerned
at the damage being done to Germany's reputation.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, federal economics minister, offered to act as a mediator
between the two sides after Mr Piech's accusations of mud-slinging and his
declaration that the case was a war in which the US concern wanted to
destroy his company.
Meanwhile, Mr Lopez denied in a statement further claims in the weekly
magazine Der Spiegel that 'secret' documents from a meeting in Germany on
March 10, the day after he signed a contract to work with immediate effect
for VW, were shipped at his request to his home in Uribe, northern Spain.
This conflicts in part with allegations last week from Adam Opel, the US
group's German subsidiary, that local staff, unaware of his new job,
fulfilled his requests for 'internal' Opel data which were presented at the
meeting to be sent to Spain.
According to Der Spiegel, Mr Lopez had earlier asked for nine cartons to be
sent to the Uribe address. The boxes, weighing 150kg, were reportedly sent
on February 22.
In his statement at the weekend, issued on his behalf through VW, Mr Lopez
said he had asked 'at an earlier' point for books, magazines and personal
documents from his Opel office to be sent to Uribe.
According to evidence presented to prosecutors last week but released by VW
at the weekend, a VW director claimed Mr Lopez was subjected to emotional
pressure from Mr Smith to try to keep him at the US group in March.
Mr Smith allegedly pleaded with him to stay, warning that GM would go
bankrupt if he left, and that Mr Smith would be sacked.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Politicians usurp the technocrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a sense of history unfolding in Brussels yesterday afternoon as
finance ministers trooped into offices near the empty shell of the
Berlaymont, former headquarters of the European Commission.
The presence of the politicians - who were noticeably absent nine months ago
when sterling and the lira crashed out of the exchange rate mechanism -
showed that this time everyone grasped an essential truth. The latest crisis
was too important to leave to the technocrats alone.
At stake was the future of European monetary co-operation based on a
Franco-German axis, and the more elusive goal of European monetary union.
On Saturday, after more than six hours of deliberations, the technocrats of
the EC monetary committee had been unable to reach agreement on a plan to
save the ERM.
The impasse underlined unresolved tensions between France and Germany over
the Bundesbank's refusal to lower short-term interest rates.
Germany called for both the monetary committee and ministers' meetings in
the hope that a decisive action plan could be endorsed at the highest level
among the 12 member states, before financial markets reopened today.
The EC monetary committee - comprised of senior central and Treasury
officials - discussed several options for defusing the ERM crisis. But
according to informed sources, officials could only agree to the principle
that the European monetary system and its exchange rate grid had to be
preserved.
European monetary officials said France's determination to resist a
devaluation of the franc had increased pressure on the Bundesbank to lower
short-term rates after its largely technical move on Thursday.
The broader French strategy seemed aimed at forcing Bonn to make a choice:
either to break publicly with its traditional ally in Paris, or to twist
arms at the central bank to lower the key discount rate.
Germany's decision to call the emergency meetings reflected these
conflicting political pressures. But it also pointed to Bundesbank worries
that unlimited intervention on behalf of the French franc risked an
inflationary bloating of Germany's money supply, as during last September's
ERM crisis which led to the forced exit of sterling and the lira.
The EC monetary committee discussed all available options for easing the
crisis. All contained significant drawbacks and are believed to include:
A suspension of the ERM for a limited period. The attraction of an 'extended
vacation' for the EMS currencies from the ERM grid was that it would prevent
France losing face; it would introduce much-needed flexibility into the
system; and it could be defended as the best chance of restoring economic
growth in the EC through lower interest rates.
But allowing currencies to float would jeopardise the single market and
would amount to a grievous blow to the Maastricht treaty's goal of European
monetary union by the end of the century.
The forced exit of several currencies from the ERM, including the franc.
This might make practical sense, as it would almost certainly allow France
and Spain to lower interest rates. But it would encourage talk of a
'two-tier' ERM, undermining France's 10-year policy of maintaining parity
with the D-Mark.
A deal involving a devaluation of the franc in return for a cut in the
German discount rate. This would be a significant climbdown for the
Bundesbank, but analysts recalled that a similar political trade-off last
September involving a cut in German rates in return for a devaluation of the
lira failed to prevent the Black Wednesday crisis.
A widening of the fluctuation bands within the ERM beyond their current
level of 2.25 per cent (excluding the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo).
This would avoid an official devaluation of the franc but would amount to a
de facto depreciation, which was counter to the franc fort policy. It might
also be dismissed as a ruse to buy time.
As ministers and officials laboured yesterday to come up with a convincing
deal it was clear the outcome would have profound political and economic
repercussions for the European Community.
If the Bundesbank agreed to a discount rate cut, this would amount to a
humiliating public U-turn. How such a retreat would play before the German
public - and the German constitutional court which is currently reviewing
the Maastricht treaty - was another matter.
On the other hand, a French devaluation and/or a suspension of the ERM would
be viewed as a devastating blow to European monetary co-operation.

MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, was seeking
yesterday to play the honest broker between the warring factions in
continental Europe as finance ministers met, writes Peter Marsh in Brussels.
There were suggestions in the Belgian capital that he would use the UK
experience to offer a constructive way out of the exchange rate mechanism
impasse, perhaps by suggesting that other countries follow Britain's lead
and allow currencies to float outside the system, so allowing lower interest
rates. There have been signs of an upturn in the UK economy since Britain
left the mechanism last September.
However, the chancellor was thought to be keen not to alienate Germany and
France. He said the UK would be 'helpful' and wanted 'a sensible solution'
that would assist European recovery.
Mr Clarke faces domestic pressure to lower base rates, held at 6 per cent
since January.

his departure that he intended to make a 'friendly and constructive'

Britain withdrew from the ERM last September and has since called for
rectification of 'fault lines' in the system. It was in a position, Mr
Clarke said, to say to its other European partners: 'We did tell you so.'
Mr Clarke, accompanied by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
said: 'We are, in a way, observers making sure that no fallout occurs which
damages Britain or brings unnecessary uncertainty and instability.'
He hoped arrangements could be made which would maintain recovery prospects
for other European economies and which would avoid the turbulence and

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Flexibility is key to ERM restyling - Looser
system evolves for linking Europe's currencies

<TEXT>
THE European exchange rate mechanism lives to fight another day - but only
just.
This morning's agreement by European Community finance ministers in Brussels
 -reached only minutes before the markets opened in Tokyo - provides a
revamped, new-look ERM which is completely different from the system's
architecture when it was sketched out in 1979.
The accord, hammered out after nearly 12 hours of negotiations, provides for
a minimalist form of currency linkage involving fluctuation bands of 15 per
cent - much bigger than the 2.25 per cent bands which until today applied
for most of the system's eight currencies.
The ministers' preferred solution to patching up the mechanism was forced on
them after unprecedented selling of weak ERM currencies at the end of last
week which brought the mechanism close to collapse. The talks exposed deep
divisions among the EC member states about the kind of framework for
currency co-operation which they wanted.
It featured strong determination by Germany in particular to see constructed
a more flexible ERM which would reduce the heavy intervention operations
which the Bundesbank has been forced into during the past year as part of
the effort of propping up weak ERM currencies.
While Britain appeared to play a constructive role in using its own
experiences of being ousted from the ERM last year as providing useful
lessons for the system's future operation, the meeting exposed Spain as the
one EC nation firmly in the camp of suspending the system's rules at least
temporarily to allow currencies to float and so permit lower interest rates.
What emerges from today's agreement is a much looser system for keeping
currencies close to each other. It will be seen by some hardline ERM
supporters as a dilution of the idea of forcing different countries'
economies to converge by enforcing only restricted movement by their
respective currencies around a central rate.
On these grounds, some will doubt whether the overall goals of the ERM have
been retained.
However, the revamp answers the strong conjecture that because of the
inflationary implications of German unification the role of the D-Mark as
the ERM anchor had been seriously weakened. By permitting a much greater
degree of currency movement, the new operating rules should provide extra
flexibility that could deter further reduction in investor confidence.
A further plus, in the eyes of the designers of the new-look ERM, is that in
theory it should be able to provide for lower interest rates by several of
the countries in the system. And by retaining the existing central parities
against then D-Mark of all the seven other currencies in the mechanism, it
ensures that no country will have to admit to having agreed to a politically
humiliating devaluation.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, told reporters that Germany had
produced the first proposals for resolving the ERM crisis. These focused on
two areas: widening the fluctuation bands and suspending the obligations to
intervene on behalf of weaker member currencies.
Underlying the German move was a desire to preserve the European monetary
system and the ERM parity grid. This was the minimum area of agreement
reached during Saturday's discussions of the EC's monetary committee.
Mr Waigel said there had been 'many, many rounds of talks' between member
states, often chaired by Belgium which holds rotating presidency of the
European Community. The proposal to suspend the ERM's operating rules was
strongly resisted by the European Commission.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Ministers back current parities - Communique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EC finance ministers and central bank governors issued the following
statement after their meeting in Brussels:
'THE ministers and central bank governors of the member states of the EC
have decided to widen temporarily the obligatory marginal intervention
thresholds of the participants in the ERM to plus or minus 15 per cent
around the bilateral central rates.
This measure of limited duration is in response to speculative movements
which are exceptional in amount as well as in nature.
Indeed, having regard to the fundamental economic situation of the member
states participating in the system, the current parity grid is fully
justified. The ministers and governors therefore reaffirm support for the
current parities and are confident that the market rates will soon approach
these parities once again.
The monetary authorities of the member states will continue to direct their
monetary policy towards the aim of price stability.
All the member states reaffirm their determination to put the treaty on
European union into operation as soon as its ratification is complete,
including the evaluation procedure which according to article 109E must take
place before January 1 1994, the start of stage two. Moreover, they reaffirm
their support for the procedures and criteria laid down in the treaty with
respect to the attainment of a sufficient degree of convergence in order to
allow the realisation of economic and monetary union.
The new compulsory intervention rates will be communicated by the monetary
authorities in time for the opening of foreign exchange markets on August
2.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: D-Mark remains the investors' choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE franc fort policy has become the victim of its own success. The European
exchange rate mechanism was supposed to be the route to low inflation. But
the irony of last week's turmoil was that the currencies the markets were
selling - the French franc, the Danish krone and the Belgian franc - were
under pressure because their inflation rates are currently too low. If any
country deserves to be punished for veering off the low inflation road, it
is Germany and not France. So why should French virtue be so badly rewarded?
The reason is that the D-Mark remains, at least for now, the ERM's anchor
currency. And being the anchor of a system of semi-fixed exchange rates,
such as the ERM, means setting the interest rate floor. The ERM's current
problem is that this floor, while appropriate for inflation-troubled
Germany, means dangerously and unsustainably high real interest rates for
the low inflation countries.
But hold on: theory suggests that the anchor ought to be the country which,
on average, has the lowest inflation rate. Because inflation is expected to
erode the anchor currency's value less than the other currencies, investors
will accept a lower return for holding it.
The first chart shows why the D-Mark was the clear anchor for the system
during the first decade of the ERM's existence. During the years 1978-87
German inflation was by far the lowest of the member countries at an average
of 3.2 per cent a year. Consumer prices in France rose more than twice as
fast over the period, with an average annual inflation of 8.8 per cent.
Three years after German reunification, however, this argument no longer
seems to apply. In June 1993 German inflation stood at 4.2 per cent: the
highest of all the countries in the ERM's northern 'core'. If low inflation
is the prime qualification for the anchor currency then, by rights, Denmark
and Ireland should now share the honour.
Yet the Danish and Irish finance ministers have made no such claims, while
the French finance minister, who suggested the franc could be the new ERM
anchor, has been punished by the markets for what now seems a piece of grand
hubris. Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minster, this weekend reaffirmed
the D-Mark's continuing and vital role as the ERM anchor.
How can Mr Waigel still make this claim? The explanation is that a country's
long-term inflation prospects are what matter to investors when they are
evaluating a currency's relative risk and return. The right-hand chart
measures the markets' long-term predictions for inflation in all of the ERM
countries as implied by the yield on long-term government bonds. It is easy
to see why Germany was judged by far the best low inflation bet during the
first decade of the ERM. But, despite Germany's current problems, the
Bundesbank's reputation for delivering low inflation remains intact. Only
the Netherlands has a marginally lower long-term bond yield than Germany:
6.4 per cent compared with 6.6 per cent.
So, for all Germany's current difficulties, investors do not think that
future German inflation will remain higher than in other ERM countries.
Whether the D-Mark will remain the anchor currency will depend on whether
the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy succeeds in bringing German
inflation under control. If, that is, there is still an ERM for it to
anchor.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, warned last night that
a collapse of the European monetary system would be a serious blow to the
single market, agencies report from Paris.
He was speaking while finance ministers and central bank officials of the
twelve EC countries were still meeting in Brussels in a marathon session to
try to salvage the European exchange rate mechanism after the latest turmoil
in the currency markets. His remarks came before ministers announced their
decision on wider bands of fluctuation for most ERM currencies.
The single market, launched at the end of 1992, 'could not survive if there
were constant exchange rate fluctuations or competitive devaluations,' Mr
Delors said in an interview with the FR3 television channel.
'Without stable exchange rates inside the Community, we would lose all the
benefits of a big single market,' he said from his holiday home in central
France.
The single market is the EC's ambitious programme, largely in place, to
remove barriers to the movement of goods, currency and people within the 12
member states.
Mr Delors said he personally favoured floating the D-Mark. He saw this as
the best solution to the latest crisis in the EMS since the problems stemmed
from a unique situation in Germany created by unification.
'Given that there is a country which is undergoing difficulties because it
has to finance German unification, and given that it has an inflation rate a
little higher than the others but with a currency respected worldwide, it
could take a break from the system for a few weeks or months,' he said.
Mr Delors added that a few years ago the exit of the D-Mark from the
European monetary system would have destroyed it.
But he said: 'Today there are five other strong currencies in the system and
as a result the system is completely different from that of a few years ago.
'It is true that the D-Mark is the world's second reserve currency, but the
other (EMS) currencies are stable and strong and they are able to co-operate
among themselves.'
Mr Delors said he had discussed the currency crisis by telephone with
several heads of state but gave no details of these discussions.
Mr Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of Italy's central bank, predicted at the
weekend that the European monetary system would survive its worst battering
since it was founded in March 1979 to bring stability to exchange rates.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Media fusillade puts alliance to test -
France is ignoring its domestic difficulties, preferring instead to blame
the markets

<TEXT>
PARIS is a mistress which Bonn can no longer afford to keep, the Die Welt am
Sonntag newspaper suggested yesterday. The relationship endangered the
stability of the German currency, it claimed.
In a signed editorial under the headline 'Ritual', the conservative
Hamburg-based Sunday newspaper warned Chancellor Helmut Kohl to resist any
appeals from France for renewed solidarity or an acceleration towards a
mini-monetary union centred on the franc and D-Mark.
'Acceptance of such or similar wishes from Paris by the chancellor would
attack the Bundesbank from the rear,' it said. The German central bank well
knew that a second currency union within five years would mean the end of
the D-Mark's stability.
In France, however, the press pointed the finger of blame for the latest ERM
crisis at Germany - particularly the Bundesbank - and at 'Anglo-Saxon'
speculators. The targets reflect a fraying of relations with France's
closest ally and a belief that France differs from the UK and the US in its
economic principles.
The quality French newspapers were careful to draw the distinction between
the German political and monetary authorities, acknowledging it was the
decision by the Bundesbank not to cut its principal interest rate last week
which brought about the ERM's most serious crisis.
'The members of the Bundesbank council are acting like provincial managers,'
said Le Figaro. 'The EMS is built around the D-Mark, those who guard the key
currency also have international responsibilities.'
In the popular press, the distinction between Bonn and the Bundesbank is
blurred and the criticism becomes sharper. 'By putting the interests of
'greater Germany' first, the Bonn government has isolated itself,' says Le
Quotidien, the right-wing daily. 'It has already lost its friends and
tomorrow the consequences of this Prussian obstinacy may seriously
jeopardise its own prosperity.'
Die Welt am Sonntag, meanwhile, said the grounds for Mr Jacques Delors'
recent proclamation that the French franc could soon replace the D-Mark as
the lead currency in the European monetary system could only be found by
using psychiatric methodology.
The editorial's author, Mr Harald Hotze, an old Brussels hand, referred to
the 'trauma' in the early 1980s when Mr Delors, now president of the
European Community and then French finance minister, sought three franc
devaluations within 16 months.
In Italy, a front-page editorial in Corriere della Sera said Germany had in
effect given up its European leadership role when the Bundesbank put
national interests before those of the EC and refused to cut its discount
rate.
'The leadership of a system implies that a country is willing and able to
take account of the interests of member states and subordinate its national
interests to these.'
In contrast, many German editorials underlined the enduring popular
obsession in the country with monetary stability - a condition in which the
Bundesbank consistently enjoys more popular credibility than the government
or European union.
The Sunday edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung went beyond the
central bank's normally muted statements: a glance at German inflation and
money supply figures would show further interest rate cuts were 'forbidden'.
The French press believes UK and US attitudes towards currencies are also a
factor behind the ERM's troubles. 'The war between the international
speculators and the central banks is a shock between two cultures,' said Le
Monde in an editorial.
'One is inspired by liberal Anglo-Saxon ideologies, the other by a more
continental, dirigiste, ideal.'
In the Anglo-Saxon view, says Le Monde, currencies are simply commodities.
For the French, however, who subscribe to the 'continental' ideal, a
currency is a measure of value within a nation and is not like other goods.
Currencies must, in this view, be assured a certain stability.
For Le Monde and other French newspapers this differing perception helps
explain why international currency traders, dubbed 'Anglo-Saxon
speculators', have attacked the European exchange rate mechanism.
Hostile to a fixed currency system, the speculators have bet that the French
economy cannot sustain the high level of interest rates which would be
needed to fend off their assault.
For Le Figaro, the motives of the speculators are deeper. 'The currency
traders are in favour of universal free trade. They are hostile to a
European protectionism concerning Gatt of which they suspect France of being
a conspirator.'
The attack was taken up later by Mr Roland Dumas, the former French foreign
minister, who said in a radio interview: 'You have to look at who profits
from the crime.
'I think there is, on the part of the Anglo-Saxons in particular, a
determination to see European construction stopped.'
Asked if he meant the British or US governments, he said: 'You know
financial forces are a mixture. Governments, private forces, banks and
interests are intertwined. In general, the construction of Europe and the
reinforcement of the European Community offends some countries in the
world.'
Mr Dumas, a close adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, said the new
French government had been hasty and imprudent in its monetary policy.
'Bringing interest rates down rapidly means making our currency more
fragile,' he said. The new government cut interest rates ten times in as
many weeks after taking office.

<TEXT>
IF THERE is one Frenchman who might stand to gain politically from a change
in the franc fort policy it is Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly
president who has made no secret of his desire to see France unhook its
currency from the D-Mark and reflate its economy with lower interest rates.
If such a change is forced on France in the near future it could make Mr
Seguin a contender for the presidency in 1995, according to Mr Dominique
Mosi, deputy director of France's Institute for International Relations.
'Seguin has put his entire weight behind France devaluing the franc and
following a British-style economic policy,' he says.
The leading Gaullist opponent of the Maastricht treaty in last September's
referendum campaign, Mr Seguin got his present job, in which he presides
over parliament but does not lead its conservative majority, because the
Balladur government wanted to park him in a largely honorary post. But
outside parliament Mr Seguin has refused to let his views be sidelined.
He has hammered away at the need for government to worry less about its
budget deficit and more about unemployment, while attacking Gatt and calling
for more trade protection. He has recently soft-pedalled his views on
European monetary matters, but these have not changed markedly since his
call last December for France to 'cut the franc's link with the D-Mark - and
quick'.
When Gaullist ministers called last week for 'unity behind the franc,' their
clear target was Mr Seguin. But it is significant that Mr Jacques Chirac,
the Gaullists' leader and still the party's most likely presidential
contender, has been laconic in his comments on the franc, aware that
monetary events may be moving in Mr Seguin's favour.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Bank may fuel inflation's flames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to leave its discount rate unchanged last week was
justified on the grounds that domestic inflation needed to be kept under
control. But by refusing to ease monetary policy, the German central bank
may have created a new inflationary problem for itself.
The unprecedented levels of intervention by the bank to prop up the franc -
which slipped to its floor in the exchange rate mechanism after the decision
 -mean that the German authorities now face a sharp jump in the money
supply, which could lead to higher inflation in the long term.
An estimated DM50bn (Pounds 19.4bn) was spent by the bank on Friday alone,
money that was not previously in circulation. The expectation that the extra
D-Marks in the economy will further expand Germany's already fast-growing
money supply is more acute now than it was last autumn.
The estimated DM65bn of intervention over two days during this crisis
compares with DM90bn used over two months at the end of last summer. As a
result German M3 growth will creep upwards, as it did then, although the
Bundesbank will try to 'sterilise' the impact of extra liquidity.
Sterilisation occurs when monetary authorities offset extra domestic
liquidity created through foreign exchange operations by withdrawing
liquidity from the system, usually by issuing government debt. According to
Mr Thomas Mayer of Goldman Sachs, no lasting impact on the domestic economy
results from intervention, provided it is sterilised at some stage.
The Bundesbank sterilised the impact of its intervention on the foreign
exchanges in August and September, although M3 growth was boosted for
several months.
So far the bank has been slow to mop up the excess liquidity, worried that
to do so too promptly would send the wrong signal to foreign exchange
markets. According to Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland
Global Markets, swift sterilisation may have been interpreted by foreign
exchange dealers as a sign that the Bundesbank was anticipating further
intervention.
Ms Cottrell believes the Bundesbank will act to tighten liquidity some time
in the near future. In the meantime, the domestic German economy is so
depressed that while the Bundesbank can wave goodbye to its M3 targets, it
does not have to worry about the inflationary pressures of the vast amounts
of D-Marks flooding the system.

FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Swimming against economic tide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the turmoil and confusion of the past few days, one fact emerges ever
starker: politics and diplomacy can no more resist the logic of
international economic forces than King Canute could turn back an incoming
tide, writes Edward Balls.
But the willingness of Europe's leaders to blame 'speculators' for the
crisis suggests the politicians themselves have yet to take this fact on
board.
Yesterday's comments from Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, were
typical. 'The government and the central bank is in total agreement that we,
under no circumstances, will let those who speculate against the crown win,'
he said in a newspaper interview. 'My opinion is that we can resist the
speculators indefinitely.'
The EC's central bank governors are also inclined to blame the markets. 'In
an environment of full freedom of capital movements,' they wrote in April,
'massive speculative exchange rate pressures may arise even in a situation
when central parities are backed up by sound and stable domestic economic
conditions.'
But Europe's problem is not excessive speculation. The international
investors are selling the French franc, the Belgian franc and the Danish
krone precisely because these countries lack 'sound and stable domestic
economic conditions'.
France's difficulties are obvious from the charts. Germany sets the interest
rate floor in the ERM. But, troubled by rising consumer price inflation, the
Bundesbank is keeping its rates high. Because France's inflation rate is
half that of Germany, it means painfully high real interest rates. The
result is falling output, rising unemployment and popular discontent.
The judgment of the markets seems now to be that the political need to
prevent the collapse of the ERM will prove weaker than the economic
imperative for lower interest rates. In which case, only a solution to the
crisis which delivers a fall in French interest rates is likely to satisfy.

FT  02 AUG 93 / G7 set for showdown over Russian economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven industri-alised countries and leading international
financial institutions believe Russian reforms may not survive the present
period of political uncertainty and are preparing for a showdown with the
Russian government after the summer holiday season.
One diplomat in Moscow said yesterday: 'The reformers in the cabinet
presently look weak and isolated, unable to move.' Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a
deputy prime minister and a close aide to President Boris Yeltsin, said the
basic institutions of authority were paralysed. 'Rust is eating out the body
of the state.'
A top G7 official said: 'We always recognised that Russian policy would go
in fits and starts - and this is certainly a fit. But with proper policy
from now on, this would not prevent the success of Russian reform and
further western support.'
At stake is the G7 aid of Dollars 44bn (Pounds 29.5bn), announced at the
US-Russian summit in Vancouver in April and approved at the G7 Tokyo summit
in July. Included in that figure is the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of a
Dollars 3bn International Monetary Fund loan and accelerated loans from the
World Bank worth up to Dollars 2bn in the next year. They are due to be
decided in September or soon after.
President Yeltsin, who returned early from a holiday a week ago, has made no
public appearance or speech since then. Nor has he reacted to the urgent
call by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister and the leading economic
reformer in the cabinet, for the annulment of the Central Bank's decision to
withdraw from circulation all pre-1993 cash roubles and for the sacking of
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman.
The bank's action caused chaos last week in Russia and in most members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States still in the rouble zone.
Western fears about the course of Russian reforms have been fuelled by the
precariousness of the budget and the power struggle between Mr Yeltsin and
parliament. Officials from the G7 governments and the World Bank and IMF
believe the budget proposed by Mr Fyodorov, which envisages a deficit of
some Rbs11,000 bn to Rbs12,000bn, may fall victim to pressure from within
the cabinet for extra spending, especially industry aid.
One senior G7 official said: 'I think both Fyodorov and Yeltsin have been
the losers over this last week. By the time it comes to September and
decisions have to be made, I think we could be looking at some very bad
figures in the budget.' Another said: 'If this were a country like India or
Brazil, we would already have said to the government that we could not carry
on with our programmes in the face of an incoherent reform process. I don't
think there are many inhibitions left about doing this in Russia if things
do not improve.'

FT  02 AUG 93 / EC mounts ERM rescue bid: Fluctuation of 15% for currencies
as ministers seek to resolve crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers reached an historic agreement early
today to revamp radically the operating rules of the embattled exchange rate
mechanism in a bid to salvage it.
After more than 11 hours of emergency talks in Brussels, the finance
ministers and central bank governors from the 12 member states agreed to
widen the fluctuation bands for the eight currencies in the ERM to 15 per
cent.
This represents a last-ditch bid to make the ERM more flexible and allow
broader leeway for movement of currencies to make the system less
susceptible to speculative attack.
The new 15 per cent bands will come into place from the start of trading in
Europe today. They replace the 2.25 per cent margins now applying for all
currencies in the system apart from the Spanish peseta and Portuguese
escudo, which up until this morning had 6 per cent fluctuation bands.
But this makes the ERM a 'minimalist' system which may be seen as
ineffective in keeping currencies tied together.
French economy minister Edmond Alphandery said that franc stability, both
domestically and on foreign exchange markets, would remain the overriding
priority of French monetary policy. 'Let there be no mistake. The direction
of monetary policy remains unchanged,' he said.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said that widening the fluctuation
bands - and so reducing the need for German and Dutch intervention - was
just a temporary measure to relieve tensions inside the ERM.
The aim was to return to narrow bands by January 1 next year, when the
second stage of European economic and monetary union is due to begin under
the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, expressed satisfaction with the
widening of the bands, saying it would increase risks for speculators and
would hopefully mean a relaxation in tensions. He made clear that the
Bundesbank had not made an explicit commitment to lower interest rates as
part of this morning's agreement.
Mr Schlesinger said that Germany had fulfilled more than its duties in
supporting the weaker currencies. But the Bundesbank had recently spent more
than DM60bn (Pounds 23bn) buying weaker currencies in voluntary and
obligatory intervention.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, said after the meeting the solution
was 'flexible and realistic'. He reaffirmed that Britain would be unlikely
for some time to want to return to the ERM.
In a communique, the finance ministers said all member states reaffirmed
their determinatiom to put the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union
into operation as soon as possible.
The weekend talks came after hectic selling of weak currencies in the ERM at
the end of last week. Especially badly hit by the selling were the Belgian
and French francs and the Danish krone, leaving only the D-Mark, the Irish
punt and the Dutch guilder unscathed.
The currency crisis was triggered by the Bundesbank's refusal to lower its
key discount rate on Thursday.
The new 15 per cent bands will be based around the existing central rates of
currencies in the ERM against each other and against the anchor currency,
the D-Mark.
Crucially, the Netherlands and Germany will retain their existing
relationship allowing for only a 2.25 per cent fluctuation margin between
the D-Mark and the Dutch guilder. This reinforces the impression of a
multi-tier currency grid, according to officials.
Mr Waigel said that one country - known to be Spain - had called for
suspension of the operating rules of the ERM but this suggestion had met
with strong opposition from the European Commission, on the grounds that it
could be misunderstood by financial markets.
Mr Henning Christophersen, vice-president of the European Commission, said
the deal was a temporary response 'to exceptional circumstances created by
market speculation'.
He stressed the need for close co-operation between governments and central
banks to avoid unnecessary fluctuations.
Under the deal intervention rules will apply as under the normal system
except that they will occur only at the top and lower end of the fluctuation
rate of 15 per cent.
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said: 'The deal was the best
that could be achieved.' But he added that it was not wholly satisfactory,
apparently referring to suggestions that wider fluctuation bands would
reduce the effectiveness of the ERM in keeping currencies together.
Mr Clarke said the changes in the ERM rules would leave member states free
to pursue their own policies. The changes 'keep the system intact but make
it a much more flexible arrangement'. Although sterling fell with the new
wide bands there was no question of an early sterling re-entry to the ERM.
Britain pulled sterling from the mechanism last autumn, saying it would not
rejoin until ''fault lines'' in the system had been fixed.
In their communique, the EC ministers and central bankers reaffirmed their
support for procedures laid down in the Maastricht treaty for achieving
economic convergence in the Community. They said the new wider bands of the
EC's currency grid were a temporary response to exceptional speculative
movements.
'The ministers and governors therefore reaffirm support for the current
parities and are confident that the market rates will soon approach these
parities once again.'
Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, said Spain was the only country strongly
in favour of a general float of the currencies in the ERM.
'Spain alone argued vigorously for a general float,' he said after the
meeting. He said that no country asked for a general realignment.
Asked what he thought of the decision to widen fluctuation bands to 15 per
cent. Mr Kok said: 'This was the worst but one option.'
He believed a smaller widening of the bands with variations between
different countries, or the D-Mark and guilder temporarily leaving the
system would have been preferable.
'This is an almost floating system with the exception of Germany and the
Netherlands,' Mr Kok said.
'A collapse would have been a disaster. This is not a disaster but it is a
black day.'
Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's former chancellor, said the decision to loosen
ties between currencies in the ERM had killed all plans for a single EC
currency.
'It's clear monetary union is now dead and the monetary part of the
Maastricht treaty has been made redundant,' he said.
The French franc's crisis was the same as the pound's last year.
'Like the UK, France does not have high inflation and no amount of political
commitment was sufficient to cope with German monetary conditions when they
became wholly inappropriate for the rest of Europe,' Mr Lamont said,
referring to interest rates.
In Paris, a spokesman for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister,
said he would be making no statement on the talks until today.
Officials had said earlier that he could make a statement after the talks in
Brussels ended.

FT  02 AUG 93 / Move amounts to suspension of system say dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDENING of the bands in the exchange rate mechanism in effect amounts
to a free float of European Community currencies, foreign exchange dealers
in London believe.
Early today some predicted further selling of the French franc, which
weakened sharply in Far Eastern markets immediately after the decision in
Brussels.
Several analysts said that the move by Community finance ministers,
announced in the early hours of this morning, was extraordinary because it
allowed EC currencies to fluctuate against the D-Mark by such a large
amount.
However, some dealers suggested that the decision could bring a resolution
of the key issue in the currency crisis, which is that France must be able
to cut its interest rates to boost the economy.
There was no announcement by the French authorities after the meeting, but
some analysts expected France to ease monetary policy this week, possibly
today.
'It would have been useful if Germany had cut rates,' said Mr Julian
Simmonds head of foreign exchange at Citibank in London. 'But given the 15
per cent bands, countries have now got the room to cut their rates and allow
their currencies to get weaker.'
Other market participants were more critical of the move. Mr Jeremy Hawkins,
chief economic adviser at Bank of America, said that it would have been far
better to announce the suspension of the ERM. 'It makes a mockery of the
system,' he said. 'It effectively means that you have a 30 per cent trading
range for the French franc against the D-Mark, and that is clearly absurd.'
He did not rule out the possibility that the French franc would come under
more selling pressure in European trading today.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at Union Bank of Switzerland in
London, said that the weekend-long meeting showed that Germany was unwilling
to save the ERM.
'This is obviously a clear message from the Germans that they are not
prepared to do anything for the system,' he said.
The news came amid growing tension in currency markets, with several London
dealing rooms well staffed with dealers trading the French franc.
In an unusual out-of-hours trading session in London and New York late last
night, dealers pushed the French franc well below its previous floor in the
exchange rate mechanism before the announcement from Brussels, in the belief
that Europe's monetary system was in mortal danger. The Spanish peseta was
also bought below its floor.
After the announcement from Brussels came through, the D-Mark appreciated
against most currencies, pushing the French franc down to about FFr3.4762 in
early Far Eastern trading, some 4 1/2 centimes below its former ERM floor.
The D-Mark also appreciated strongly against the dollar, as dealers in the
Far East sold weaker European currencies in the belief that there was room
for them to depreciate.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell back to around DM1.7355, having been close to the
DM1.75 level at one stage. Sterling fell back to DM2.575 from a previous
London close of DM2.585.

FT  02 AUG 93 / London dealers in vigil as Far East markets open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers in London were preparing last night for an unusual
out-of-hours trading session as they waited for European Community finance
ministers to decide on the future of the exchange rate mechanism.
London currency dealers were poised to make prices in Asian trading time.
Such trading is usually limited to the night of a UK general election or a
US presidential poll.
The meeting in Brussels is expected to have a powerful effect on today's
trading in currencies, bonds and equities.
The overwhelming view in the London market was that the selling of the
French franc would only stop this week if France announced substantial cuts
in interest rates.
'People have been selling the franc because they believe that France's
interest rates are too high,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency
strategist at Union Bank of Switzerland in London. 'The selling will only
stop if France reduces them to 4 per cent by the end of the year.' The
French intervention rate stood yesterday at 6.75 per cent.
A broad cut in rates, including the German discount rate, would trigger a
rally on European bond markets, not only in France, but also in Belgium and
Italy, which would benefit from the reduction in borrowing costs to fund
their deficits.
Some dealers believed that the continuing crisis in the ERM could be staved
off for a few weeks if there was a realignment, or a widening of the French
franc's fluctuation band against the D-Mark. But few believed that this
would be a long-term solution, even if it was accompanied by modest cuts in
German and French interest rates.
Some dealers thought a suspension of the system was the most likely outcome,
allowing Europe to cut short-term interest rates, and letting Europe's
currencies float for the first time in 14 years.
But dealers were uncertain whether the market would buy or sell a freely
floating franc. dealers believed the franc would depreciate against the
D-Mark in the short term as France cuts interest rates. But others thought
the franc could appreciate above the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark
because of France's strong trade and current account position.
Mr Eric Fishwick, an analyst at IBJ International in London, said that the
end of the ERM could trigger the start of a long-term move out of the D-Mark
into other European currencies and the dollar. 'Take the system away, and
you are left looking at Germany's fundamental economic weakness,' he said.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Business jet users accuse BAA of unfair practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOBBY group backed by some of Britain's largest companies has lodged a
complaint with the European Commission against BAA, alleging
anti-competitive practices.
It accuses BAA, which operates London's largest airports, of unfairly
excluding some business jets so that more commercial aircraft on scheduled
flights can use the overcrowded runways.
Some companies using business aircraft have contacted the office of Mr
Richard Needham, the trade minister, to argue that business aircraft should
continue to have free access to Heathrow.
The export manager of one large manafacturing company said: 'This is a
serious issue. It could be the beginning of a trend to exclude small
aircraft from major airports.'
BAA acknowledged that it wants to give more landing slots to bigger aircraft
and had cancelled some of the peak-time slots reserved for business
aircraft. It said that a small aircraft's slot is twice as long as a normal
slot because it has to wait until the turbulence caused by a preceding large
aircraft has settled down.
Private aircraft account for 4 per cent of the traffic at Heathrow.
The lobby group intends to take BAA to the European Court in Luxembourg.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Group aims to cut level of skin cancer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has had its worst late-July weather for more than a decade,
according to official figures.
They will be welcomed by the National Radiological Protection Board, an
independent body, which yesterday launched a campaign to discourage
sunbathing.
The board is to publish weekly reports on solar ultra-violet radiation, the
part of the sun's rays that cause tanning and burning.
From next year the service will give daily forecasts so that the
sun-sensitive can take evasive action. The board recommends wearing
sunglasses, a broad-brimmed hat and 'clothing with a tight weave'.
Swimmers should use a sun block with a high sun protection factor. A
protection factor of 15 allows the wearer to stay in the sun 15 times longer
without burning than without any protection.
Without protection, it takes just 23 minutes on a clear summer's day for
sensitive skin to burn in the UK, the board said.
In the Caribbean it takes little more than half that. Sunburn increases the
risk of skin cancer, and Britons' carelessness could be behind a rising
incidence of the disease. Women are more at risk because they sunbathe more
than men, said the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Pale skin and slow tanning
show a greater sensitivity, but more important is a family history of skin
cancer.
The government's Health of the Nation white paper last year said the
increasing trend of skin cancers should be halted by 2005. The Department of
Health has backed the board's initiative.
Government figures show incidences of skin cancer in England increased by a
quarter between 1980 and 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are
available.
Sufferers of the most common skin cancer need an operation to remove the
diseased area. Half of those who develop the more rare malignant melanoma
die from it. There were 1,091 recorded deaths from malignant melanoma in
1991 compared with 815 in 1981.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Private View: Still watching with mother - Lady Elspeth
Howe, chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, talks about sex and
violence on television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIOLENCE is a problem. How much it is a problem of the real world and how
much a problem of exaggerated media attention our rulers find difficult to
decide.
But the British public is said to be worried by violence on television. Five
years ago Margaret Thatcher's government created a quango called the
Broadcasting Standards Council to prove it was doing something about it -
'it' being the depiction of violence not only in the sense of mutilation,
injury or rape but also gladiatorial sex and swearing.
The appointment of William Rees-Mogg, former editor of The Times (now the
Don Quixote of Maastricht), as its first chairman was greeted with the sort
of derision that accompanied Lord Longford's inspection of strip clubs 20
years ago. The council was seen as the consummation of the Nanny State.
Last month the poisoned chalice of its chairmanship passed to Elspeth Howe,
the 61-year-old wife of the former Tory chancellor and foreign secretary
whose resignation speech was the proximate cause of Mrs Thatcher's downfall.
Lady Howe may have a nannyish air. But in right-wing Conservative demonology
she is portrayed as something far uglier. According to Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, the rent-a-quote MP, her haircut is the giveaway. She is, he once
said, the 'typical intellectual', the type who would have espoused Communism
in the the 1930s, the Lady Macbeth who handed the knife to her irresolute
thane of a husband, Geoffrey.
Not quite. Elspeth Howe may have enjoyed playing billiards and sitting up
with the gentlemen over port and cigars at the foreign secretary's country
house but she is not the self-confident, ambitious schemer her detractors
suppose.
Nor is she an intellectual. She was a secretary who became a dutiful Tory
wife and sat on women's committees, became a juvenile court magistrate and
sat on many more committees. At the age of 53 she took a degree in social
administration at the London School of Economics. She is an energetic,
amateur member of that club known as the Great and Good: she is not very
fluent when she talks, but is sincere, approachable, feminine, occasionally
even coquettish.
No, Lady Howe's real crime is that she is a feminist. She was deputy
chairman of that socialist cabal known as the Equal Opportunities Commission
and her reputations has followed her into the new job.
It is not, one might think, the function of a Broadcasting Standards Council
to push the cause of women. Or is it? Having answered, rather imprecisely,
some questions about the link between television and street violence, Lady
Howe went on to say that women as viewers and listeners were badly served
because there were too few women in top broadcasting jobs.
Even if that were true, I asked, was it any business of the council's?
'We come back to what's shown on television' she replied. 'If there is too
much violence - I'm not saying every woman programme maker would say 'we've
had enough of violence' - I think it is relevant that if we have more women
coming up we will have much more of a balance.'
Men like to show violence and women by and large do not?
'You put that into my mouth. It isn't what I'm saying. All my life I've
tried to get women and men working together on every level. The women's
groups would feel comfortable if there were more of their own sex.'
You think women should be promoted because they are women?
'Never] No, no, of course I don't. You know that. I don't think women should
be promoted other than on their ability. I have never been in favour of what
in America is called positive discrimination - but positive action, to see
they get to the right places where they can be promoted. That includes
giving a lot of attention to flexibility of working arrangements and to the
attitudes of both men and women. I'm not saying that's going to solve all
the problems of what people want to see on television.'
The council is revising its code of practice which broadcasters are required
by law to reflect in their own guidelines. Among the additions is a
paragraph on 'political correctness'. The Council, it says, 'respects the
underlying arguments' and suggests broadcasters should avoid words which may
confirm a stereotype, unless that leads to clumsy circumlocution.
I asked Lady Howe if this would make the council a hostage to various PC
lobbies.
'There are certain words we or our children may have used, like 'spastic',
as a not very complimentary comment. Now it's not acceptable because those
who are spastic find it deeply offensive. For broadcasters to be aware of
that I would have thought is common sense, common courtesy. On any view of
it, 'political correctness' changes over time.'
Surely, I said, it's the job of people who make programmes to be aware of
these things. Do they need you to tell them?
'Ah, well I would hope that self-regulation, self-discipline is the major
part of all this. That's absolutely as it should be.'
So you are a finger-wagging body?
'No, I don't think we are.'
You are admonitory?
'We are advisory.'
Mocked though it may have been, the council's code is a well-written
document with which sensible people would find it hard to disagree. The
trouble seems to be not so much what the council says, but what it is.
Powerless to help the customer or frighten the producer, it is reduced to
the status of political lightning-conductor.
The council has little bite beyond requiring its findings to be published
and, occasionally, broadcast. It adjudicates on complaints from the public
under three headings: violence, sex and taste-and-decency. (There is a
separate Broadcasting Complaints Commission to deal with matters such as
invasion of privacy. The two bodies may be merged.)
The number of complaints about violence received by the council more than
trebled last year, to 230. Yet this was less than the figure for complaints
about sex (273) and far less than that for taste and decency (587). The
figures bely the perception that violence on television is a big public
preoccupation.
Statistics are not the council's only ammunition. Its members travel round
the country talking to various groups, and research is commissioned on
topics such as the portrayal of women, of ethnic minorities and of the
mentally ill, violence on the news, or children's viewing habits.
Lady Howe claimed the council had become a credible body. 'I want to stress
 -because I do believe it - that if it was maybe regarded with suspicion
both by broadcasters and some politicians without doubt it has established
itself, certainly with a number of broadcasters, and they do take its
findings seriously.
'I think it is interesting that in quite a number of cases where we have
made findings the programme makers have acknowledged they have gone too far.
That may be a justification for having a body outside to nudge.' Her job,
she said, was to persuade.
Lady Howe is careful. Her replies were qualified to the point of blandness.
Perhaps it is because she is new to the job.
Do children watch too much television?
'I don't think it's a question of watching too much or too little. It's what
they watch.'
Do you see television as a cultural scourge?
'No, no. Quite the opposite. I am a tremendous enthusiast. The wildlife
programmes . . . I know everyone says this is boring, but if those had been
around when I was young I would have been interested . . . I think it can
have a wonderful influence, broaden minds . . . things people have never
seen before, wonderful drama, 'Yes, Minister', news, documentaries . . .'
Were standards falling as a result of Thatcher's Broadcasting Act?
'There is a concern about competitiveness and so on. No doubt all of that is
an influence. But within whatever context, it is very, very important that
one regards it as a wonderful opportunity. But it can be dangerous too.'
Do you enjoy watching sex on television? Do you find it boring?
'Up to a point. Yes I do, after a while, find it boring if it goes on and on
and on. It depends if it is relevant.'
Context, she said, was what mattered. And who will disagree with her? Lady
Howe may not be the sharpest exponent of her mission but she probably
expresses the sentiments of many people. She represents the values of an
older generation - which is not to say they are outdated - not the easy
moral certitudes of the New Right.
There is, she said, a convention of parliamentary politesse. 'I don't really
see why on radio or television, before a certain hour, we should have bad
language. Language should be appropriate to who you are with.' She might
have added that there are still places in Britain where it is considered
gross rudeness for men to swear in the company of women.
Perhaps the majority of us feel threatened and frightened by television's
relentless reflection of the ugly side of our humanity. But are broadcasters
merely holding a mirror up to Nature? Or are they cynically resorting to
shock tactics to win the widening war for ratings?
If the former, there is not much more that Elspeth Howe and her councillors
can do but grieve. If the latter, they may bark a little - politely, of
course.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Summer Rites: A Midsummer Night's tempest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A commonplace of anthropology that symbolic activity, among primitive
peoples, is practised as a means of realising deeply-nursed desires. There
are no isobar charts in the jungle, but the savage believes that if he can
perform a really contagious mime of rain falling from the skies, rain will
fall.
The civilised British likewise cherish the rain. It makes their grass green
and their marrows plump. But when they call up the rain god, it is a much
more oblique process. Rather than dance mimetic damp dances, or make loud
gargling noises beneath a full moon, they seek to seduce the elements by
challenging them.
So they print invitations for Pimms and picnics and barbecues in mercurial
June. They lug hampers to Glyndebourne. They commission the colossi of opera
to bellow to thousands in Hyde Park. And, most impudently, most
efficaciously of all, they stage Shakespeare alfresco.
The bard, arguably, begged for it. To title a play A Midsummer Night's Dream
invites every rain dancer in the land to try his luck. Not just in Regent's
Park, but in little natural amphitheatres from Dover to Dunsinane. Wherever
leafy backdrops make scenery redundant, there Puck and Oberon will plot
their elvish mischief, their mischief being: to have us all drenched before
the evening is out.
But we, the audience, are made of sterner stuff. No matter that we are
required to perch on the sort of slatted seat designed to corrugate all
human posteriors. We are well-prepared for drama's pastoral mode. Against
the icy fangs of a mid-July night, we have brought our tartan rugs, our
woollies and our nips of whisky.
Someone will kindly light a pipe or cigar, to keep the gnats at bay. And the
first downpour only steels our resolve to see it all through. What we like
to call the Dunkirk spirit flows generously. Huddled under nature's
inadequate awnings, we buck each other up.
'Only a sprinkle,' we say cheerfully. 'Won't last long.' And some insightful
person will inevitably voice the true anthropological purpose of all this:
'Just what the lawn needed]'
The drama resumes. The rain has not dispersed us, but brought us into a
closer, more comradely union. Those with fold-away plastic macs are a
natural elite; those without improvise quite extraordinary prophylactics
from Sainsbury's carrier bags. But we are equally determined to beguile the
moist night with the advertised programme of entertainment. Our money's
worth will be had, if it leads to pneumonia.
We may have suspected that Bottom's asinine mask was made from old cornflake
packets; now we know that it is. Wall wears his costume like a sandwich
board; being absorbent, and easily streaked, this Wall has been thoroughly
punished by the lord of rain. The lion roars soggily, and there is unwonted
laughter when the King of Athens takes a tumble on the sodden boards.
But one has to feel sorry for Titania's entourage - a dozen shivering
six-year olds, drummed up from the local ballet school. Given no more than a
few scraps of chiffon to cover their goose-pimpled flesh, they can only
survive this initiation by scampering round like frenzied sprites. It must
be very character-building for them.
These fresh-air Thespians are exemplary. To strut a part in doublet and hose
is demanding enough. To strut a part in soaked doublet and hose is pure
heroism. As mortals and fairies unite to take the applause, mingled with
thunder-claps, beneath the dripping greenwood tree, it is worth remembering
the justification of these heroics.
This is not the triumph of hope over experience. It fulfills a social
function: it keeps the reservoirs full.
So far as I know, Shakespeare never actually demanded of his players that
they performed out of doors. But he must have had an inkling. The rain it
raineth every day, he sings. And a hey, ho, hey nonny no, we bravely reply.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A few blunt words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty
language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised
some people. It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime
minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in
which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to
communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may
undergo correction.
What piffle. Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the
wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority
of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427
majority for the Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, the voters of
Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury.
In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty
when chatting in private than when speaking in public. In public, they have
to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible
mattness. But in private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words
become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is a spectacle.
To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know
that. In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I
wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching.
To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler. No one could have
eavesdropped. Their responses were true to form. But I have left out the
swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the
gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged . . . Four-letter
expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts)
pages.' I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive
any dispensation is a puzzle.
First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard,
Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and
Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week? They were
describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate
arrangements. They did not pull their punches. I bet you went chalk-white.
'So why not walk the plank, John? You are the most unpopular prime minister
since the start of the fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly
or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone
the cock-ups.'
'Are you sure?' the prime minister replied. 'I mean . . . how did it come
about, Michael . . . like, Christchurch, y'know - load of . . . let me put
it to you - the economy, of course . . . I mean, wimpy guy like me. But I'm
not giving in like that, like . . .'
On and on it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed
with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which
he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever
gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation.
I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John. Many people will have
agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that
the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency
and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the
elimination of opposition'. But some of your critics still accuse you, John,
of laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say to that?'
'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense
a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a
clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a
keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle. Likewise with political and constitutional
reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll
laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]'
After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch. But I couldn't
raise the energy.

FT  31 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: Continent applauds Major's great
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SORRY about this, but I have to report that the last stages of the
parliamentary progress of the bill designed to secure British adhesion to a
Treaty on European Union aroused so much interest on the continent that I
feel the need to return to it.
Last Saturday, some seemed to miss the point. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung's
headline ran: 'Major's victory in lower house: Approval for ratifying the
Maastricht Treaty.' That made me feel a bit like a citizen of Stalingrad
crawling from the rubble some 50 winters ago, picking up a copy of Pravda
and reading the headline: 'Red Army wins battle for city.' True enough, but
. . . .
Coincidentally, inside, a propos nothing, was an interview with the paper's
London economic correspondent from 1926 to 1974, Hans Egli, who still lives
in London. It was decked out with a picture of Spitfires of the kind that
anti-Maastricht campaigners made so much use of in their campaign to
maintain the full independence of those wonderful institutions that have
brought Britain to the enviable position it enjoys today.
The denouement of the Maastricht drama in parliament attracted more coverage
of a British story than anything since the last election, more even than the
equally unappetising events that have struck the House of Windsor.
But the arguments that were deployed in the course of the various debates
that led to John Major's threat to call an election occasioned no interest
whatsoever. The 'Eurosceptics', especially Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit,
appeared frequently but their opinions did not.
Of the papers I saw only the humble Mannheimer-Morgen referred to the
British debate over the Social Chapter, or whatever it is now called. The
paper dismissed the arguments curtly: 'An EC-internal market without a
social charter would be a market economy without a social safety net.'
The trouble is that the views of the British, particularly of those opposed
to the treaty, are not handled seriously. British hostility to most aspects
of the Community is viewed elsewhere in the EC as axiomatic - the Brits
always say 'No.'
One French commentator noted that in both Britain and France there was a
respectable patriotic reflex vis-a-vis Maastricht. But in the case of the
British there was, 'for this concrete and pragmatic people, a sort of
genetic inability to imagine the abstract, the intangible, to associate with
a project that originated elsewhere, one that was unprecedented, without
reference to history . . .'
The prevalence of this attitude is damaging, for it is impossible for
scepticism about many elements of the Maastricht Treaty to be taken
seriously so long as that scepticism is couched in terms that reflect
British attitudes.
There is a widespread view in Denmark that the 'Yes' majority in the second
referendum there was assured by the 'Eurosceptical' British politicians who
were imported to help the 'No' campaign.
So the anti-Maastricht campaign in Britain, most notably in last Saturday's
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, was portrayed as the creature of those whose
political careers had come to an end. The Tory rebels will not worry about
that because they care little for European opinion and had no interest in
winning a wider public to a position of non-nationalistic scepticism about
what is termed the European process.
Mainstream French anti-Maastricht campaigners, who performed so well in the
face of a huge government-backed referendum campaign last year, made no such
mistake. They inserted advertisements in the newspapers of other countries
stating that their position on the treaty did not reflect any hostility
towards their friends and neighbours. They also had the ability to make
themselves understood in other languages.
But British Eurosceptics appear as rancorous repositories of an embittered
nationalism.
One reason is what happens when one translates their statements into other
languages. The familiar '1,000-years-of-history' rhetoric sounds mad or
menacing in Spanish or German, and is therefore disqualified from serious
consideration.
The other problem is the easy British assumption that the British possess a
higher kind of patriotism, that the sense of nationhood of other lands is
somehow diminished or of a lesser nature.
Yet all over Europe there are people who eschew a policy of nationalist
rejection yet feel uncomfortable in face of the perceived implications of
the treaty, especially in the light of this week's events. The British
possess the most vocal group prepared to articulate their concerns; it is
the manner in which those concerns are articulated that discredits the case.

IN SEPTEMBER the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra changes its name to the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales. The ingredients of the title may be the same,
but the subtle shift in emphasis underlines the orchestra's enhanced status
and the fact that the BBC is not its only source of finance.
At the moment the future for several of the BBC orchestras looks uncertain.
(Pessimists say that the bottom line is to save the BBC Symphony Orchestra,
the flagship, which could be dire news for the rest of the fleet.) But the
BBC Welsh SO has manoeuvred itself into a strong position: active local
support, funding from the Welsh Arts Council and SC4, a territory over which
it reigns supreme, a hall of its own at St. David's in Cardiff.
More important - it plays as if it has confidence in itself. The orchestra's
visit to the Proms at London's Albert Hall for two concerts this week could
hardly have been a better advertisement for the high standards to which it
now aspires. Although it has only been at full permanent strength of 90
musicians since 1987, there is an unanimity about the way they play that
suggests a well-knit ensemble, keenly rehearsed by their Principal
Conductor, Tadaaki Otaka.
The performances were not self-regardingly glamorous, or virtuoso displays.
What they had was discipline. This amounted to more than just being tidy, as
Strauss's Don Juan, a characterful opening to Tuesday's concert, announced
from the outset. Grieg's Piano Concerto, with Martin Roscoe the very able
soloist, was much the same - not grand, not bombastic, but every note came
across as though the work had been thought about afresh.
Otaka's views on the music of William Walton were clearly going to be both
fresh and worthwhile. (Has there ever been a Japanese conductor of the First
Symphony before?) Any amount of detail was fastidiously put in place. Ravel,
rather than Stravinsky, seemed to be an inspiration for the music, so
exquisite was the blending of timbres in the slow movement; but the finale
did ultimately rise to an resounding conclusion.
The second concert comprised just one work: Mahler's Sixth Symphony. If
there is one criticism of Otaka, it is that he expresses himself in neat
clauses and sentences rather than paragraphs, which robbed both the Walton
and the Mahler of some of their long-term intensity. But for precision of
playing, clarity of focus, the Mahler was another performance which hit the
bull's eye.
It is difficult to recognise in these two programmes the orchestra as it
used to perform 10 or 15 years ago. The BBC Welsh SO has started undertaking
international tours (Germany and the US planned for 1994) and is well on the
way to becoming an impressive cultural ambassador.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: A Stone's view of success - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 50th birthday of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger might seem trivial to
frivolous people but he is, rightly or wrongly, among the most famous of
living men. Unexpectedly, the BBC celebrated the date on Radio 2, where song
comes usually from different sources. It was a good feature they gave us,
produced by Peter Aston, part biography, part sociology, not too much music.
Clearly, Jagger's success has come from his own effort, not from outside
coaching (unless you include his manager, Andrew Loog Oldham). His family he
rates as bourgeois; he was bright enough at school to pass into the London
School of Economics ('really boring'). He had no moral convictions as a
young man: 'I've got my own morals.' In 1967, he got three months for a drug
offence, a sentence that William Rees-Mogg, then editing The Times,
condemned.
He sang because that was what people were doing; his style is due to his
love of 'the theatre of it.' With success, he is socially ambitious, with
aims like MCC membership. His accent has gone up or down, probably with no
personal design. Mary Whitehouse says she 'got on well with him.' Philip
Stone, compiler of the programme, says he speaks good French, is cautious
with money, friendly with children, weeps easily under stress. 'A
knighthood, OK? Don't want a life peerage.' I wish him another 50 years but
won't be buying his records.
The World Service is doing a four-part series on The Slavs - sadly, not
about the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia but about the historic and cultural
elements of the Slav people. There are more of these than we generally
think; they stretch from the Baltic to the Pacific, from the Arctic to the
Mediterranean.
Last week's programme was history; presenter Wanda Petrusewicz went back to
the 6th century when the Slavs were peaceful farmers, comprising one-third
of the European population. In the West were Roman Catholics, in the East,
Moslems, but most adhered to old polytheistic beliefs.
Subsequent events increased the proportion of Christians, now generally
divided between the Catholics and the Orthodox church. As we know, there are
also Moslems in Bosnia - in Bulgaria, too - although religion, as such, is
not involved in the Bosnian disasters.
Yesterday's programme dealt with religion in more detail, with a specific
cheer for the visit of the Slav Pope to Poland. Next Friday's programme is
more relevant to our time, recalling the PanSlav movements of last century
and Tito's aims in that direction, and considering the Slav nations' mutual
relationships today after the decline in Europe of the Russian influence:
proud of being Slavs, inclined toward nationalism. The programme can be
heard on the World Service at 0730, repeated at 1215 and 1930.
Radio 3 is giving more and more time to non-musical material, and this week
has repeated some of last year's programmes about the US. On four days, we
had Irish novelist Tim O'Grady's look at young Americans; alas, I could hear
only one of them, a delightful half-hour about Nancy Lemann on Tuesday. She
is a Southern writer living in New York, and she stimulated great
conversation about 'the old verities' that include baseball. Also on Tuesday
was a repeat of Piers Plowright's A Bus Named Desire, an unusual view of New
Orleans of which I wrote enthusiastically when it was last broadcast, and
which I enjoyed as much this time.
Alexander, Radio 4's Classic Serial, is as exciting as ever. The boy
Alexander (Simon Crane) makes an unauthorised trip to Olympus, tames the
restive Bucephalos, then grows up enough (now played by Michael Maloney) to
be appointed regent during Philip's absence, and to be advised by him to go
after women and get himself a son. Splendid stuff.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: Chamber music in the north - Kuhmo Festival / . . .
the far north, that is. A new hall in the Arctic Circle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALMOST in the Arctic, a very small Finnish town
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with many visitors from distant places - is now hearing the last of its 24th
Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival. There the cellist Seppo Kimanen founded it in
1970; his keen instinct for programming and for tempting the right artists
to come has ensured that this super-abundant festival has gone from strength
to strength. For lovers of chamber music, to visit the Kuhmo festival is to
court instant addiction.
This year's festival, however, has been marked by a glorious transformation.
Until now, concerts have always been held in the gymnasium of the local
school, in Kuhmo Church and in other less gracious places. Kuhmo town is
after all barely more than a glorified crossroads, amid unspoiled Northern
lakes. The new municipal library was its first seriously modern building;
the Arts Centre, newer still - finished just days before the current
festival began - is a specifically Finnish triumph, a modest marvel of
practical design.
Canny finagling by Kimanen must have been crucial. Though every Finnish town
with a population of at least 20,000 is entitled to a nationally funded
music-school (yes]), Kuhmo town has only 13,000-plus. Its case surely rested
upon the ever-growing festival, a vision of what an Arts Centre might bring
to the town and region, and a plan of intensive music-teaching for the wider
Kuhmo area. A part of the centre will be the quarters of the new
music-school; and if the main concert hall seats fewer than 700 people
(albeit in roomy comfort), it boasts a stage large enough to accommodate a
full orchestra, or any big local show.
It is beautiful. The external silhouette - music-school, auditorium with
sloping roof, the backstage extension - is unshowily elegant, not grandiose.
Inside, the foyer is coolly airy and lofty (clean lines, dovetailed stone
and wood), with a luminous view of the Lammasjarvi lake, pines and silvery
willows beyond its great glass wall. The Lentua concert hall, however, is
all of blond Kainuu pinewood - the stage, the house, the seats - and it
glows, in moulded curves and walls of vertical strips.
The ceiling is ornamented with what look like up-ended, dozen-legged stools
(a deliberately homely touch), and with starry clusters of tiny lights hung
in the pattern of the Great Bear. The acoustic is warm, lively, intimate and
lucid, flatter=strings and voices: nothing is ever so good as wood.
Altogether, this must be one of the friendliest and most successful concert
halls in Europe. There is a smaller Pajakka hall too, and a dance studio.
(Architect, Matti Heikkinen; acoustician Alpo Halme.)
It remains to be seen whether the town can really make sufficient use of it,
outside the two-week Music Festival. I fancy, though, that in two or three
years Kuhmo will wonder how it ever managed without it. This a slight
humidity problem still: from time to time a concert would be punctuated by a
dry, woody crack] - but we were assured that nothing will fall down.
That was particularly noticeable in the new Icelandic music (expounded by
native devotees), for much of it kept falling into long, mortified silences:
one had always supposed that life in Iceland would be like that. The newer
the music, the more 'intuitive' and formally exiguous it seemed, with an air
of introspective melancholy. I was most taken with the revolving patterns
and folk-dance rhythms of Karolina Eiriksdottir's mixed-quartet Renku.
Among rediscoveries, the Petersen Quartet from Berlin brought a delectably
witty Five Movements by Erwin Schulhoff, a Czech Jew who died in a
concentration camp. A string quartet by the Swedish composer Laura Valborg
Aulin (1860-1928) was gracefully appealing; but an A minor piano quintet -
same instruments as Schubert's 'Trout' - by the Parisian Louise Farrenc
(1804-75) made a great impression. Well-crafted and finely sonorous, with a
hyper-active piano part, it belongs to a very substantial oeuvre: I hope
that someone may even now be copying out the parts for one of her three
unpublished symphonies. Musical feminists have a composer worth championing
here.
Last year the festival added an 'International Forum of Young Violinists' to
its menu, and the 20-year-old Armenian Nikolai Madoyan reappeared now to
display a truly sensational technique (he and Maxim Vengerov had the same
teacher). This year it was the turn of young pianists. I missed a
much-praised recital by 15-year-old Albert Kim, but heard two astonishing
12-year-olds.
From Kazakhstan came Dasha Rabotkina to play a recital including Schumann's
Faschingsschwank and several of her own compositions with unwinking
musicianship and aplomb. As for little Jonathan Gilad from Marseilles, his
calm maturity in Mozart and Schubert was uncanny, and the breadth and power
of his Brahms - the 'Handel' Variations &amp; Fugue, no less - scarcely
credible. There must be a prodigious career in the offing.

THE 1992-93 art market year, which officially ends today, will not linger in
the memory. It saw the main auction houses report a slight rise in sales,
but any return to the heights of 1989-90 will be slow and tortuous.
Sotheby's has the greater cause for satisfaction. Its old competitor
Christie's seemed to be driving remorselessly toward Sotheby's traditional,
that is 19th century, saleroom dominance, but New-York based Sotheby's,
building on the slightly renewed business confidence in the US, was able to
re-assert itself over its London rival.
It achieved sales of Pounds 773m (Dollars 1.2bn), a rise of 20 per cent in
sterling terms (but only 4 per cent in the more relevant dollars) as against
the Pounds 683m (Dollars 1.06bn) turnover at Christie's (a gain of 16 per
cent in sterling and 1 per cent in dollars). So the gap between the two has
widened again.
This is a small consolation when set against both auction houses' sales in
the rogue record year of 1989-90 when Sotheby's registered a turnover of
Pounds 1.96bn and Christie's Pounds 1.46bn. At both sales are less than half
those of that annus mirabilis when, for sometimes financially dubious
reasons, buyers, the Japanese in particular, displayed an insatiable lust
for works by Van Gogh, Renoir, and other Impressionists, leading to the
highest price ever paid for a picture of Dollars 82.5m, for a Van Gogh.
But the steady-as-she-goes improvement in sales this season, the first
upward movement for three years, was not without incident. For Christie's
things could have been oh, so much better, if the highest bid in London
during the season, the Pounds 7.7m. from the Zurich dealer Edgar Mannheimer
for an early 19th century calculator, had proved real.
For a happy week or so Christie's believed it had pulled off a coup, for the
calculator had only been estimated to sell for Pounds 15,000 or so. But then
the money was not forthcoming and Christie's had to decide whether it was
the victim of a hoax or whether Mannheimer had completely misread the mind
of a prospective collector. The real victim is the vendor who went on
holiday to celebrate his unexpected windfall and is now being placated by
Christie's.
The most encouraging feature of the season was the return of large bidders
for high- priced Impressionist and post-Impressionist pictures. The summer
sales in London and New York did well. Buyers are still selective and
dealers lack the cash and the confidence to acquire stock, but top-quality
paintings are selling again. Sotheby's was amazed when it sold a Cezanne for
a record Dollars 28.6m and a Matisse for Dollars 14.3min its May sale in New
York. Such deals should bring out other masterpieces which owners have been
reluctant to risk on the market.
London could not match that but Christie's achieved the highest price in the
UK this season when it sold a typical Renoir portrait of a pretty girl for
Pounds 5.72m. The picture had sold in the feverish market of 1987 for Pounds
2.9m. Its surprise early re-sale at a much higher figure suggested that the
Japanese were returning.
The second highest price of the year in the UK was paid at the Bond Street
dealers, Noortman, when a continental collector gave around Pounds 5.5m for
a De Hooch scene of a courtyard in Delft. Noortman had bought the painting
at Christie's in December for Pounds 4.4m, slightly below its estimate.
Christie's was relieved to sell it for the child in the painting had an
unattractive face. Another cleaning improved her appearance - and the work's
value.
In spite of expectations Old Master paintings did not become the rival, and
successor, to the Impressionists. They cannot shake off problems of
condition, attribution, and obscurity. Fortunately, the Getty Museum of
Malibu still has its mighty cheque book and bought the other main Old
Masters on offer, a Goya bullfighting scene for Pounds 4.95m, a Michelangelo
drawing for Pounds 4.2m and a Caspar Friedrich romantic landscape for Pounds
2.3m.
In the main the finest and rarest objects sold while the mundane were passed
over. By persuading vendors to reduce their reserves Sotheby's and
Christie's marginally improved their sold percentages at auction to 80 per
cent of lots on offer. There were disappointments. Christie's expected to
set a record price for a miniature when it offered a double portrait of
Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein, but this was sunk by doubts about the
Holbein link.
Jewels remain a firm market and top quality English furniture and silver
were solid. Victorian art enjoyed a revival.
The art market is marching in line with the US and UK economies; two steps
forward then one step back. Didi Brooks, chief executive of Sotheby's
America says: 'The trend is getting better at a fairly gentle pace'. David
Tyler, financial director for Christie's, sees 'a slow consolidation'.
As confidence returns so will better properties. Sotheby's can look forward
to another multi-million pound clear out from the castles of the Princes of
Thurn and Taxis. Christie's is handling the sales of the art of the late
Rudolf Nureyev.
The other UK salerooms carry on the struggle. Phillips, with its
concentration on the middle market, has been hit by the reluctance of people
to move house and sell the contents. Its turnover fell slightly from Pounds
85.3m to Pounds 79.6m, but Bonhams bucked the trend and raised sales 27 per
cent to a record Pounds 27.9m.

TALL STORIES ARE TRUE: THE COLLECTED STORIES OF EDGAR WIDEMAN
Picador Pounds 8.99, 432 pages
THE CRAFT OF storytelling has always held a primal importance for
African-Americans. Deprived of access to conventional means of historical
narrative as well as to much of the media, blacks in America have
nonetheless managed to forge a vibrant and varied fictive tradition which
has kept their culture alive.
It is this heritage that informs the work of John Edgar Wideman and provides
an explanation for the seemingly paradoxical title of his collected stories.
In Wideman's world, all stories are indeed true, if truth means they can
help remedy the lies and distortions which mainstream white society has
often employed to keep blacks in their place. Throughout this book's 34
stories, Wideman's characters, usually inhabitants of the Pittsburgh
community of Homewood, tell one another tales, tall or otherwise, in an
attempt to understand their often bleak lives.
This preoccupation with the craft of storytelling is the glue of the first
two volumes, All Stories Are True (1992) and Fever (1989). In the title
story, a man retells a tale told him by his convict brother about a leaf
that flew out of a prison as it was cheered on by the inmates. It is a
stirring image of freedom and escape, given added poignancy by the man's
admission that his jailbird sibling will never explain that the leaf was
blown back in again. The story's truth lies not in its factual accuracy but
rather in the way it expresses a desire for freedom.
In 'Signs', a black college professor complains of anonymous racial abuse,
only to confess eventually that the whole affair was her fabrication.
Wideman, though, leaves plenty of doubt as to the veracity of this
confession, making us wonder if perhaps the teacher did it just to end the
abuse. Once again, factual truth is bypassed to lead us to deeper
understanding of the psychology of racism.
When people are unable to tell one another these liberating stories, life
becomes more difficult, even unbearable. In 'Doc's Story', an abandoned
black husband rues his decision not to share the more imaginative aspects of
his culture with his white ex-wife, particularly the story of the blind man
who could play street basketball with the best of them. 'Fever', meanwhile,
is a brilliant exercise in positive revisionism, telling the story of a
black man who helped a white doctor during Philadelphia's yellow plague of
1793, during which white historians have inaccurately claimed local blacks
behaved in a cowardly fashion. Here, better than anywhere else, one sees the
real Wideman at work, his almost oracular voice able to keep his people's
myths and heroes alive.
On occasion, Wideman lets his extra-literary bent get the best of him,
creating stories in which the artifice subsumes the tale told, such as the
jazzy 'Everybody Knew Bubba Riff', a Joycian stream of consciousness that
defeated this reader's weary eyes. And it is hard to see what place the
post-Modernist hijinks of 'Surfiction' have in the same volume as the
devastating 'Newborn Thrown in Trash and Dies'.
The high point of this book is the third volume of stories it incorporates,
Damballah (1981), a masterpiece of black American fiction. For reasons known
only to themselves, Wideman and his editors decided to place it last rather
than up front where it belongs. Damballah's 12 stories provide the fictional
history of a Homewood clan, from slave days until the present. Far better
than Roots, it depicts the pressures brought to bear on the African-American
family and the strategies for survival it has been forced to undertake to
stay together.
The book is peppered with heartbreakingly beautiful moments, such as when
John French, the family's strong man, finds a dead baby in the garbage.
Afraid of reporting it to the white authorities, he decides to bury it,
working during a snow storm to dig a deep enough grave. When he realises he
has no way of interring it other than dropping it six feet, he first shovels
in a bedding of fresh snow to cushion the fall.
Later in the family's history, an old woman examines a woven silk portrait
of her granddaughter her son had made while he was in Vietnam. Everyone in
the family hates it because it makes the little girl look Oriental, though
the grandmother is able to imagine the old Vietnamese man who sewed it,
seeing in his handiwork his own granddaughter, dead perhaps from napalm. It
is with moments like these that Wideman shows himself to be a writer who
rarely sounds a false note, a writer who, at his best, can make any story
sound true.

THE GRANDMOTHER'S TALE

Heinemann Pounds 9.99, 134 pages
FASCINATED
by Miles Gibson
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 245 pages
CAMPION'S GHOST
by Garry O'Connor
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 246 pages
THANK GOODNESS for the Empire. Britain's predilection for the poles of a
more and more derivative frivolity and a less and less rational gloom is
undermining the art of the novel. Where would we be without the deeper
imported shades of the Caribbean, the subcontinent and other outer marches?
Take Miles Gibson's new book Fascinated, a gorgeously written romp through a
London underworld of bruisers, mugs and molls. Frank Fisher, a nobody of a
marketing man for the Fancy Wholesale Fruits Corporation, is yanked by a
fluke into the dangerous orbit of mega-rich gangster Conrad Staggers. To win
the heart of the beautiful Valentine, he must learn to kill. In the process
he 'comes to understand the need to give death a moving target'. Gibson's
writing is rich and randy, the plot as slick as it is predictable. But the
characters are celluloid, the scenes a cartoon pastiche mixing Raymond
Chandler with Arnold Schwarzenegger. A good read for sure, but Fascinated is
little more than a clever kid's screenplay.
As for gloom, Garry O'Connor paints a very unfunny portrait of John Donne in
his imaginary memoir of the metaphysical poet, Campion's Ghost. The facts
are that Donne was raised as a Catholic, gained fame as a voluptuary, and
ended his career as a pillar of the Church of England. O'Connor, perhaps
informed by his long association with the theatre, has the poet thumping
across the stage as a maudlin penitent, haunted by the Tudors' brutal
persecution of Catholicism, tormented by guilt. His is a regret which we are
told was shared by Queen Elizabeth, whom we meet in one unlikely scene
seeking absolution from a dashing Jesuit priest who is meant to serve as a
sort of alter ego to the sorry Donne.
There is a great deal of gallivanting about, miraculous rescues and the
like, but the swashes in Campion's Ghost do not quite buckle. Donne the poet
never really comes alive. We hear nothing, for example, of his foreign
travels. And why is every Protestant brutish and cynical, every Catholic
brave, sexy and wise?
The problem is that O'Connor has chosen a cumbersome vehicle to prove his
conviction - expressed in a peculiar note at the book's end - that England
lost its soul by suppressing the One True Faith. We are expected, one
supposes, to applaud the subtext of hostility to such modern horrors as
divorce, the ordination of women priests and so on.
After the thinness of Gibson and the sullen zeal of O'Connor, an old pro
like RK Narayan comes as a relief. At a sprightly 86, the doyen of Indian
letters remains true to form. The Grandmother's Tale, three short novellas,
has all the naive passion and gently mocking humour of his best work. The
stories are simple: a child bride stalks her absconded husband, a
bureaucrat's greed brings disaster, a poor housewife achieves literary fame
by way of her oblivious husband's skill in the kitchen.
To the dismay of his more critical countrymen, Narayan makes no pretense to
modernity. His pre-Independence India is a lost world, rooted in Hindu fable
and populated with Bertie Woosterish innocents. But the characters have
depth; their motivations ring true. Narayan may have little to say about
fundamentalist rage, but what he can do is conjure the quality of light.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: Raw talent from a multi-ethnic world - A collection of
ceramic sculptures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE FRANKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S evolving multi-cultural society is not always the subject of
admiration, but one of its positive elements is shown in the current show at
the Barbican in London. Various potters of different ethnic origin have
added stunning ingredients from their own backgrounds and cultures to a
ceramic exhibition of 30 contemporary British artists, which takes its title
from anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss's 1964 book The Raw and the Cooked.
The show tries to prove that Art is Art is Art. Here we go again: that old
chestnut, art v. craft. In our visual culture, hierarchical differences are
firmly established - in art schools and in government departments doling out
money - enhancing wrong-headed perceptions of art status.
The need to clear meaningless classification is now overdue. Thank you,
Bernard Leach, for pushing the ceramic movement forward; thank you, Hans
Coper, for veering off so magnificently into more sculptural forms. Now let
us get on with the clay-moulders in Britain and stop slinking behind the
rest of the world, decrying any clay work other than a teapot. If a person
works with his/her hands - holding a paint brush, a chisel or a clay tool -
and produces something of quality and originality, he or she is an artist.
This is the third exhibition organised by The Museum of Modern Art in
Oxford, surveying British visual culture. MOMA's brief to the curators,
Alison Britton and Marina Margetts, ruled out any overtly functional work,
looking rather for diverse clay sculpture beyond utility: clay is here being
looked at as an art material. Britton (an esteemed potter) and Margetts
(former editor of Crafts Magazine and writer) have sought out those doing
interesting, innovative work today. The selection process naturally fashions
themes, but the curators discarded this approach, not wanting to be
restrictive.
Preoccupations clearly emerge. Non-western cultures - Chinese, Malaysian,
Nigerian and Indian backgrounds - lean on a different civilisation from
ours. Lawson Oyekan's huge, hand-built pots evoke memories of African
landscapes, the clay wrapping around itself as it might enclose a family
group. Consider how differently Ewen Henderson's structures approach
landscape and memory with his irregular lava-like mixtures reminiscent of
the moon's surface.
Pamela Leung, brought up in Hong Kong, has built a ceramic tiled wall
mixing, as in a Chinese tale, reality and myth: a man's body with a bull's
head rests on a table above a pot and a stringed instrument. Trupti Patel
has stacked a tall pentagonal pillar with open niches, combining witticisms
like feet and umbrellas with glimpses of thought-provoking figures. It is
particularly interesting juxtaposed with sculptor Antony Gormley's
'Twenty-Four Hours', a dramatic march of 24 plodding figures in a single
diagonal line, graduating from 2.3cm to 9m.
Like Gormley, other British artists are also concerned with identity.
Jacqueline Poncelet's large, undulating forms lean against the wall, their
patterned, earth-coloured tattoos making them strangely approachable. 'The
objects', she writes in the catalogue, are 'simultaneously ugly and
beautiful according to our belief in the normal.' Tracey Heyes uses the
Grecian-draped dress as a metaphor for repression; Grayson Perry makes
confessional vases.
Artists, perhaps with the exception of the untutored, 'outsider' artists,
are grounded in tradition. This education is obvious in all the works,
regardless of their sculptural forms.
Exhibition designer John Pawson must have been nervous about breakage and/or
theft. To install these three-dimensional pieces along an extended shelf
against the wall is frustrating (a mirror might have helped), though
somewhat mitigated by the fact that no glass separates the pot from the
viewer. This is a show in which the interesting range and technical facility
of the artists should awaken a sense of pride in an open-minded British
audience.
The Raw and the Cooked. Barbican Lower Gallery, London, until September 5,
then to Oxford and Swansea.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: In the world of Walter Matthau - Nigel Andrews enjoys
a masterclass with Hollywood's most distinguished sourpuss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MY FATHER was an itinerant menial worker,' recalls Walter Matthau. 'He was
an electrician, carpenter, photographer. My mother always used to say . . .
Rene, what happened to those nice b-o-w-l-s?]?'
His mother said what? Rene the waiter looks startled; Matthau, in
mid-reminiscence, scowls at his salad plate; Leonard the agent, seated
opposite, gives me a crisis-smoothing smile. It is 1.40 pm in a dining-room
at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club and Hollywood's most distinguished sourpuss
is giving us a masterclass. For the next five minutes the rococo Matthau
vowels and sing-song Matthau adenoids are deployed in caustically comparing
bowls to plates.
Forty years and as many films - including perennials such as The Odd Couple,
The Front Page and A New Leaf - have turned this man into the best-known
comic misanthrope since WC Fields. No star has more ingratiated himself by
being uningratiating. Look up 'grouchy' in a dictionary and you will find
Matthau's face there. Rubber-duck features with excess-baggage jowls; narrow
eyes sunk under half-mast lids; thick black hair slapped on top - 'real',
Matthau insists - like a mortarboard on a crusty teacher.
This week he returns in Dennis, a rampaging-kid comedy scripted by John
'Home Alone' Hughes. Though the film's American title was Dennis The Menace,
it has nothing to with the shock-haired delinquent known to Beano readers.
'I didn't even know you had a Dennis the Menace in Britain,' Matthau
proclaims. 'Our film is based on a comic strip by Hank Ketchum, who lives up
in Carmel. Dennis is a six-year-old terror and I play his neighbour Mr
Wilson, who's described as 'cur-mudgeonly' and 'can-tankerous'' - Matthau
chews over every syllable - 'but like all curmudgeons, with a heart of
gold.'
Pause for Rene to set down new salad bowl. 'I wanted to play it another way.
I wanted to play a guy who really hated kids.'
Matthau's off-camera duties on Dennis included teaching co-star Lady Olivier
how to speak Chicago-style. 'Every time Joan got British I'd say, Not
'worried', dear, 'werried'. My own accent is fair-to-middling New York. But
I can do Chicago. 'A ket-ehhstrophe is something that shouldn't hehhpen . .
.''
A master mimic, Matthau can also do Deep South, Far West and broad Cockney,
though he is modest about the accent he used in his last major film,
Polanski's ill-starred Pirates. 'I wanted to do Irish but Roman said there
are no Irish pirates. I tried Cockney at the audition and the British guy
acting with me said, 'Very, very good. Australian?'' As for Pirates itself,
Matthau still winces at the film that probably toppled him from the
box-office heights where he had lived happily for 20 years. 'Humour is not
Polanski's forte,' he darkly states. 'The film was jumbled, confused, it
was' - pause for word-search - 'ob-fus-cated.'
As delivered by Matthau, this one-line vocal snapshot is more memorable than
the whole movie. Pouncing on words and teasing them into constituent growls
 -they seem to come with a whole commentary of baroque mockery - is one of
the secrets of his wit as an actor. He started his screen career playing
mangy, rangy villains in movies like Fail Safe and Charade. Then Billy
Wilder, after almost giving him the lead role in The Seven Year Itch, put
his elastic features and gnarled vocal emphases into Meet Whiplash Willie
(1965). That began the double-act of Matthau and Jack Lemmon - sardonic
vinegar and plaintive oil - and the equally flavoursome relationship with
Wilder.
'Billy saw me as the quintessential con man. You know, 'Watch out, this guy
will sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.' Lemmon was the gullible innocent - which
of course he is in real life]
'People don't believe you can do comedy until you do it. For years they took
one look at me and said, 'You're the villain.' An actor when he starts out
is judged by his face. You, for instance' - I brace myself - 'would be cast
as the villain. You're not glamorous enough to be the leading man. He' -
Leonard braces himself - 'would be the 'best friend.' When Ronald Reagan was
running for Governor of California, Jack Warner said 'Governor? Ronald
Reagan? No. Best friend.' A governor has to have wit, intelligence,
aggressiveness. Warner couldn't see any of that in Reagan.'
But who could have seen Matthau's destiny in his unpromising origins? He was
born to a Jewish immigrant family on Manhattan's East Side. For his start in
show business he sold drinks in New York's English-language Yiddish Theatre.
'Soft drinks and three-flavour ice bricks. Then they put me on stage and
gave me a couple of lines. I played an old lady in a crowd scene and my
lines were 'Mazel-tov] Mazel-tov]''
After that it was more high-profile theatre on Broadway, alternating with
historic days in live TV. 'I must have done over 100 television shows and it
was the best acting experience you could ever have. Made you think on your
feet. First thing you learn is, if you're sitting around doing Chekhov and
the cat walks in, you must pay attention to the cat. You cannot continue
with the dialogue of Chekhov without including the cat. So on live
television we'd automatically go into ad-lib gear. There's the famous story:
suddenly the phone rings on stage and there's not supposed to be a phone
call. And it's persistent. And eventually the guy walks over, picks up the
phone, says 'Hello?' Then he looks at the other actor and says 'It's for
you.']'
Accident-management became a Matthau speciality. In a Broadway production of
Anne Of The Thousand Days he remembers bustling on stage as an unannounced
understudy, behind the back of Rex Harrison delivering a high-flown
soliloquy at stage front. 'I was playing the old bishop and I came on and
said' - deep-voiced British accent - ''I have known you from a child, King
Henry, I was present when you took your first three steps.' At which point
he turned his back to the audience and in a very loud Rex Harrison voice let
out 'Oh shit]' So for the next ten minutes all I could hear was the audience
whispering 'Did he say shit? Did King Henry say shit?''
Matthau finally escaped into movies. But for his first ten years in
celluloid he was only ever cast as the foreign-looking heavy. 'They saw me
as a tall Jewish Ukrainian, talking about horses and smoking cigars. I was
never cast as the lead. A woman stopped me once on the boardwalk on Coney
Island and here were her exact words. 'Hand-some? I've seen better. But
you're something, I don't know what]'
'Later, when they determined I was a box-office draw, they started to give
me leading roles in which I was connected to the female romantically.'
Connected to the female romantically. No other actor in Hollywood talks like
that. Matthau plays with polysyllables as if they were precious coinage; and
even simple words become valued currency for him in the right context. He
once had a debate about a small conjunction with Neil Simon, who wrote
several comedy roles especially for Matthau, including Oscar in The Odd
Couple. 'In one of his plays I said to Neil, Can I say 'I got hit by a puck
instead of with a puck. And he said, the line is 'with'; but he let me try
it. And 'by a puck' got a bigger laugh. It makes the puck an animate
object.'
Why - since Matthau clearly knows his mind when it comes to how comedy
should read and play - hasn't he followed the current Hollywood trend and
turned from actor to director? See Eastwood, Redford, Beatty and company . .
.
'Actors seem to think there are more important things than acting. That
includes not just directing but mouthing off about politics and causes.
Maybe they're right. But if you plan to keep acting as well, you'd better
decide how much you want to jeopardise your credibility. As an actor, you
have to leave yourself open for different roles. If you're a flaming
reactionary or liberal, you bring hostile elements into your corner. The
less you say about yourself, the better off you are. Otherwise people say:
Oh I know him, he's that Jewish fellow from New York who was impoverished as
a young man - why's he trying to play an Episcopalian priest?'
Matthau himself is still haunted by the career advice he once gave a fellow
thespian from England. 'I once did two films with Glenda Jackson. One night
we were dining with some aristocrat friend of hers in London and she was
talking the hind legs off us about social justice and class and poverty, and
afterwards I said 'You know, Glenda, you really should go into politics.''
Matthau takes a rueful chew on his salad. 'I understand she took my advice.'

STRANGE GODS
by John Cornwell
Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 262 pages
THE GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS
by Nicholas Salaman
HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 465 pages
THE ALLURE of sin and guilt for the fiction maker often goes with the notion
that spiritual redemption follows expiation. Thus, the theme invites
situational cliches - as, for example, in John Cornwell's Strange Gods, in
which an ordained Jesuit priest - a high-flying whizzkid in the fund-raising
branch of the organisation - has an affair with a young woman, which he
enjoys not least because of its forbidden nature; crisis follows as love
collides with the inflexible demands of vocation.
From this familiar setting, however, the story, and the moral direction,
develop in quite unexpected ways. Having got Jill pregnant, Nicholas Mullen
decides to decamp on a mission in Peru rather than give up his vocation and
do the right thing by Jill. Before that, over an expensive meal, he tries to
touch a wealthy benefactor for a tidy sum for Jill and her unborn baby. He
gets his come-uppance along with a lecture on hypocrisy.
So, obsessed with sex, filled with guilt and self-loathing, and
disillusioned with the world, Mullen arrives in Peru to work with Father
Christian O'Rourke in the fever-infested rain forests. The zealous O'Rourke
is a charismatic character with a reputation of Loyola and Mother Teresa
rolled into one. That too turns out to be an illusion. But from the strange
contest between Christianity as wielded by O'Rourke, and the native religion
of the local Amerindians, Mullen's own moral development begins. Having lost
against the gods of the Mekroti tribe, O'Rourke's mission is brought to a
grisly end by the political god of the Shining Path terrorists. The story is
often gripping and well-told.
Nicholas Salaman explores sin, guilt and the vision of Hell in The Garden of
Earthly Delights, based on the life of the 16th century Dutch painter
Hieronymus Bosch and his apprentice, Julius. The Master is commissioned by
an esoteric order headed by an enigmatic Jew to paint the eponymous Garden
but dies before finishing the painting. The task of completing Hell is left
to Julius, who has suffered the torments of lust and doubt and has been
rushed into a loveless marriage to a coarse Millenialist who turns out to be
his half-sister.
The couple move to a town in Germany, where Hell and all its concomitants
are played out in reality to an apocalyptic denouement. There is a lot to be
said for a well-researched historical novel with an exciting setting and on
this count Salaman scores highly - the main backdrop is the millennial
fervour of the Anabaptist cult, and he has used Norman Cohn's classic The
Pursuit of the Millennium to good effect.

THE TRUTH ABOUT RUDOLF HESS
by James Douglas-Hamilton
Mainstream Pounds 14.99, 256 pages
CONSPIRACY theories never die, nor even fade away. One can only try to
expose them. This book should be read because it puts to rest some of the
myths that have gathered about the story of Rudolf Hess's extraordinary
flight to Britain on May 10 1941.
An expanded re-issue of a book first published in 1971, this account by the
Duke of Hamilton's son makes use of fresh documentary material, some from
Hamilton papers but also from Foreign Office records, including MI5 files,
opened for public scrutiny in 1992. It is handsomely illustrated with many
unusual, and previously unpublished photographs from British and German
collections.
A well-researched introduction by Roy Conyers Nesbit, a wartime navigator,
and Douglas-Hamilton's expanded text demolish the myth that the man who flew
to Scotland and was later imprisoned in Spandau was not Hess but an
imposter. Nesbit's reconstruction of the RAF's tracking record for Hess's
flight calls into question the account given by John Costello in Ten Days
That Saved The West (1991) and undermines the argument that the Duke of
Hamilton knew of Hess's project and made efforts to assure his safe passage.
It was a combination of Hess's daring and skill, the RAF's technological
deficiencies, and luck which helped the deputy Fuehrer evade his pursuers
until a fuel shortage forced him to bale out south of Glasgow.
Douglas-Hamilton disposes of the charges that the Duke knew Hess and that
the flight was arranged by the Secret Service as a peace plot in the name of
Hamilton but without his knowledge.
Hamilton had never met Hess previously although both attended the 1936
Olympic Games. The connection was through Albrecht Haushofer, son of the
geo-politician Karl Haushofer, whose theories so appealed to Hitler. The
elder Haushofer, teacher and friend of the young Hess, became partly
dependent on the protection of his old student because he had a half-Jewish
wife.
Albrecht was a conservative nationalist German with deep misgivings about
the Nazis. Albrecht became Hess's pre-war personal assistant and
Ribbentrop's diplomatic agent, with a particular interest in Anglo-German
relations. Opposed to the war, and passionately concerned to preserve peace
between Germany and Britain, Albrecht, in a letter in July 1939 to the
future Duke of Hamilton, whom he knew well, warned of the imminence of war
and pleaded for a British peace plan.
By 1940, still serving Hess, Haushofer was in contact with conservative
resistance circles. He provided the link between Hamilton and Hess in May
1940 when Hess, anxious to restore his position with Hitler, sought to open
communications with the London government. German documentation, not used
here, supports the author's contention that the Fuehrer knew about these
peace efforts. They were but one of many attempts in the summer of 1940 to
secure the agreement with Britain that Hitler wanted.
Albrecht, on Hess's urging, wrote to Hamilton, now in the RAF, in September
1940 suggesting a meeting in Portugal. The letter was intercepted and for
reasons still unknown not acted upon until five months later. It was
forwarded to Hamilton, who was asked by the Air Ministry to arrange a
rendezvous for intelligence purposes. The matter was still under discussion
when Hess, frustrated by the failure of Albrecht's initiative and knowing of
the forthcoming Russian invasion, took off for Hamilton's home in Scotland.
Hitler was taken by surprise. Hamilton was totally in the dark. It was not
until Hess's flight that London realised that Albrecht was the eminence
grise in the affair, though he knew nothing of Hess's plan. False
information on the BBC, subsequently corrected, directly linked Hamilton and
Hess. Churchill's decision to provide no details beyond the announcement of
Hess's arrival and detention opened a Pandora's box of speculation that is
still not closed.
The British government mishandled the affair, missing a propaganda
opportunity in Germany and raising alarm in Moscow. Misleading intelligence
reports from Kim Philby and Colonel Moravetz, head of Czech military
intelligence, convinced Stalin that Hess had been encouraged to come to
Britain to conclude a peace settlement and to secure support for the attack
on Russia. These suspicions, never abandoned, were reflected in a British
Communist Party pamphlet calling Hamilton a friend of Hess. The British
government reluctantly allowed Hamilton to sue for libel. A public
retraction followed but ministers sweated out the possibility that Hess
might be a witness.
Douglas-Hamilton has successfully dealt with some - though not all - of the
questions still surrounding this bizarre episode. His account leaves out
some of the background information needed to understand the connection. For
the most part, too, the author has only used the new Foreign Office files to
amplify the story he has already told. It is unfortunate that he did not
expand the later sections for, as his tantalising summary of the contents
suggest, they apparently provide far more information than is given here. A
brief epilogue covers Hess's trial at Nuremberg, his imprisonment and
suicide in 1987.
As in the original version, the last chapter deals with the fate of
Albrecht, who was arrested after the July 20 plot peace and shot on the
night of April 22-23 1945 as Russian troops closed on Berlin. One is
grateful for a sensible account of the flight, but this will not be the last
book on Hess.

APPLE FIRE, THE HALESWORTH MIDDLE SCHOOL ANTHOLOGY
edited by Jill Pirrie
Bloodaxe Books Pounds 7.95, 128 pages
GENERALLY speaking, it has not been a good year for children's poetry. The
only memorable collection of the spring was Philip Gross's The All-Nite Cafe
(Faber, Pounds 3.99). At his best, Gross is an inventive and imaginatively
far-reaching poet, but the book's format and general presentation were so
mean and unappealing that few children are likely to have seen it. More's
the pity.
Matters have taken a turn for the better, however, with the publication of
three new anthologies. Two are good: The Orchard Book of Poems for older
children, chosen by Adrian Mitchell (Pounds 14.99); and First Poems
(Orchard, Pounds 8.99), compiled by Julia Eccleshare, who has for many years
been responsible for editing that excellent annual publication, Children's
Books of the Year.
Best of all, though, is Apple Fire, a selection from the many poems written
by children between 11 and 13 at Halesworth middle school, on the Suffolk
coast, under the tutelage of their English teacher, Jill Pirrie. Over the
past decade, 54 of Pirrie's pupils have won individual awards in the annual
WH Smith young writers' competitions, and the general quality of the poetry
in this book is quite astonishing.
It reveals an acute sensitivity to the hidden resources of language, an ear
for its music and a sense, above all else, that these children have
discovered something akin to what the Bronte sisters discovered at Haworth
parsonage in the 1820s. In the words of Ursula Le Guin, they have 'learned
the landscape of their own being and how to describe it.'
Learning poetry by rote in UK schools is, effectively, dead - and few would
wish anything else. But where do we go from here in teaching poetry? There
are, of course, creative writing classes. But none can succeed without a
teacher who both understands the value of poetry and can share that
understanding with children.
Pirrie has both these qualities, as is evident from her excellent
introduction to this book: a wise, trenchant and entirely unsentimental
defence of the value of poetry in a child's life.
Every child is an oddity; and every child can be encouraged to put words and
images to the sights, sounds and feelings particular to himself. The task
demands wakefulness and an attention to detail - which children possess
naturally in abundance. By discussion and example, the impetus to write can
be released and the capacity to think, look and listen in words be nurtured.
The positive consequences, when achieved, are three-fold: the universalising
of particular experiences; the reconciliation of inner and outer worlds;
and, most exciting of all, new perspectives on the ordinary.
The child, guided properly and encouraged, is enabled to come into the
inheritance of a living, shared language, quickened and refined by its
literature. The promotion of literacy is a much larger and wider thing than
helping a child to be a master of the language of cliches; and teaching
poetry, with the close attention that it demands to the meanings of
individual words, together with its economies of form and structure, is an
ideal way of introducing children to the value of language itself.
It all sounds heady and inspirational stuff, but the fact is that the
results are there to be sampled in this excellent book. These children have
been quickened into a radiant perceptiveness by their sympathetic teacher;
and Pirrie must have felt from time to time what that other teacher, DH
Lawrence, described once at the end of a poem entitled 'The Best of School':
I feel them cling and cleave to me
As vines going eagerly up; they twine
My life with other leaves, my time
Is hidden in theirs, their thrills are mine.
But who taught the teacher? The most important presence in this book is that
of Ted Hughes, Britain's finest living poet for children. Pirrie often uses
his farmyard fable, What is the Truth?, to set the creative process in
motion.
Many of the children's own poems are written in a forceful, driving,
Hughesian vers libre, and have that hot, sharp stink of fox about them,
irrespective of whether they are dealing with animals, dead or alive, or the
natural world in all its beautiful fragility.
An earlier book by Hughes, Poetry in the Making, contains a useful piece of
advice for teachers that Jill Pirrie quotes in her introduction: 'Their
words should be not 'How to Write' but 'How to say what you really mean' -
which is part of the search for self-knowledge and perhaps, in one form or
another, grace.'
These are important matters - too important to be left to the teachers
alone.

PUBLISHING NOW
edited by Peter Owen
Peter Owen Pounds 12.95, 175 pages
PUBLISHING, like other industries, is starting to pick itself up from the
floor after the battering it received during the recession. Anyone who wants
an up-date on what has been happening there during the past two traumatic
years could not do better than to consult Publishing Now edited by Peter
Owen, one of the canniest, most durable and adventurous of the few remaining
independent publishers.
Owen has assembled a team of contributors whose professional skills cover
many different aspects of this complex business. Here are people from the
new conglomerates alongside representatives of the old-style
gentleman-publishers; and here are articles by those concerned with literary
fiction, mass paperback fiction, illustrated books, academic books,
children's books, feminist books, gay books.
In all these areas, the period has been one of far-reaching change, and
perhaps the most significant has been the original paperback - a book which
has its first, and possibly only, edition in paperback. Owen's is one such,
and the fact that I am reviewing it gives it parity of esteem with the new
hardbacks on this page. That is something which publishers, particularly
those of serious fiction, have been fighting to achieve for years.
Original paperbacks are not a new phenomenon, not even for literary fiction;
imprints like Serpent's Tail in London and Polygon in Edinburgh having been
publishing them for a long time. But, at the end of 1991 and the beginning
of 1992, several companies with a long and distinguished tradition of
literary fiction publishing, like Secker &amp; Warburg, Chatto &amp; Windus and
Hamish Hamilton, began to publish original paperback fiction.
In an article called 'The Death of the Hardback?' Dan Franklin, the head of
Secker and Warburg, recalls the strategy of compiling a paperback fiction
list with a distinct series identity, selling at Pounds 7.99 in a format
midway between that of the average hardback and the mass-market paperback.
Before the plunge was taken, the support of the booksellers - particularly
Waterstones and Dillons - was canvassed and a positive response given. But
there was still a fear that the books would be consigned to oblivion by the
literary editors of newspapers and magazines.
'Without reviews, (Franklin writes) the books would die. However, our fears
were unfounded. Generally, each book has had at least as much review
coverage as it would have received in hardback.'
In the old days, a small hard-cover sale of around 1,000 copies was enough
to establish a novel; if review coverage was favourable, there was the
expectation of a mass-market paperback edition 12 months later. But this
minimum hardback sale can now be achieved only rarely. Ian Chapman, in his
article on 'Paperback Publishing,' explains: 'The view is that anywhere
between a 4,000 and 10,000 copy sale at a midway price of Pounds 8.99, let
us say, is better than a sale of under 1,000 copies at Pounds 15.'
Clearly, it is too early to ring the death-knell of the fiction hardback -
let alone the non-fiction hardback in such areas as literary biography - but
we are likely in the future to see more and more novels appearing first time
round as 'C-format' (ie, posh-looking) paperbacks.
A further phenomenon, that of marketing the book on a diskette that the
customer inserts into a portable computer and reads from the screen, is not
dealt with here. Yet, American publishers like Random House are already
exploring this in association with AppleMac computers. Jurassic Park, The
Portrait of Dorian Gray and The Annotated Alice are among titles on offer in
this form.
It might sound ridiculous but there are certain advantages in having a book
on disc. A paperback, however up-market, tends to foreclose on a reader
unless he or she exerts pressure to keep it open. The first two titles above
would clearly be enhanced by the computer's graphics and, in the third, the
footnotes are almost as great a delight as the text (and are embedded much
more neatly in it on screen).
For couples in bed, where one partner wishes to switch out the light and go
to sleep and the other to continue reading, the noiseless computer screen
that casts almost no light beyond itself is the perfect solution.
Advances in electronic printing have brought about many fundamental changes
 -a technological revolution which is continuing. Some of the implications
are dealt with by Robert Adkinson, of Thames &amp; Hudson, who underlines the
internationalism of the modern printing process.
The co-edition - a book funded jointly and published simultaneously in
several different countries - remains of paramount importance for most art
books. Colour reproduction, already at a high standard, is likely to improve
further through 'non-impact printing, with ink jets operating to pre-set
co-ordinates controlled by computer.'
The inroads made into the industry by computers are apparent throughout many
of the articles. There are creatures like EPOS which monitor the sales of
stock in the chain-store bookshops; JANET, which gives librarians rapid
access to information; and CARL, a document delivery service in Denver,
Colorado, with which Blackwell's has formed an alliance.
Electronics do not do it all, though. Publishing still depends on human
input from people like editors (Dan Franklin), publicists (Jacqueline
Graham), agents (Giles Gordon), booksellers (Tim Waterstone), and last - but
by no means least - authors (Peter Vansittart). These people all contribute
lively articles to this stimulating book.

THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL
by David Schoenbaum
Oxford Pounds 30, 418 pages
AMERICANS, in one of their periodic moods of navel-gazing, have lost
interest in abroad. With the end of the cold war, the US has lost a role and
feels encumbered with an empire.
The mood of inattention has America's clients worried. Israel, which since
1967 has slipped (against its better judgment) into an unhealthy degree of
diplomatic, economic and technological dependence on the US, suddenly feels
a disturbingly cool breeze from Washington. Once, the Israelis used to worry
about US diplomatic hostility; now, they notice something even more menacing
 -lack of interest.
David Schoenbaum's is by no means the first history of the American-Israeli
relationship, and yet another requires some special, saving grace. He has
read scores of memoirs, interviewed participants, and dug out diplomatic
documents. He does not, however, use Hebrew sources - a strange deficiency
in a book on such a topic published by a respectable university press. As a
result, many central issues are skirted or ignored.
Then, too, the book mentions only fleetingly one of the main engines of
American support for Israel, the Israeli lobbying organisation in Washingon.
Called the America-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), it rivals the
National Rifle Association with its skill in mobilising support in Congress
and the bureaucracy.
Why should America continue to support Israel? Until a few years ago, the
Israelis could present themselves, plausibly, as formidable regional allies.
Now, though, the spectre of the evil empire has been laid and the US is no
longer in the market for local exorcists. The Gulf war - in which the
Israelis were told, humiliatingly, to put up and shut up, provided a vivid
illustration of the transformation of their position in official Washington
eyes.
Digging deeper into their arsenal of used-up arguments, Israeli spokesmen
boast of the 'shared values' of the two countries. But the whole world now
loves democracy, chicken McNuggets and apple pie, and it is by no means
obvious to the American taxpayer that Israel has a premium over other
supplicants at the table.
Then, of course, there is the real reason for US involvement: the American
Jewish community. The British Foreign Office has long regarded it as
perverse and unnatural that US foreign policy should pay attention to the
views of this large and influential internal constituency.
Ernest Bevin, Labour's foreign secretary after the second world war,
ascribed his personal failure at the end of the Palestine mandate to the
unwarranted interference of the American Jews in a matter he regarded, with
an almost perverse unrealism, as none of their business.
Like it or not, though, the bond between the Diaspora and Israel was and is
a political fact, one that Bevin and many since discounted at their peril.
From time to time over the years, the US State Department, like the Foreign
Office, has read American interests differently and sought to steer policy
away from support for Israel. But, since 1967, such deviations have always
been rectified by the elected elements of US government.
American bureaucrats, like their British colleagues, used to regard such
presidential or congressional busy-bodying as unconscionable interference in
the diplomatic process, but they have by now learnt to live with it. So long
as 6m American citizens continue, unfashionably, to maintain interest in a
foreign cause, and so long as they are influential in political life, the US
commitment to Israel is likely to remain unbreakable.
The pathways that lead from this ethnic solidarity to a strange alliance
(that is not formalised in any treaty) require further exploration - and
never more so than now as the present Arab-Israeli peace talks enter their
most critical phase.
Unfortunately, this book adds little by way of new information or new ideas
to what has been said and written on the subject already. It more or less
grinds to a halt around 1987, so that the reader looking for fresh insights
into the present 'peace process' will be left unsatisfied.
On many key issues, Schoenbaum refrains from disclosing his own views. Was
Israel a 'strategic asset' to the US during the cold war, as was often
claimed, or was it a millstone round America's neck? Could the US be a
friend to Israel and, at the same time, an honest broker in negotiations
with the Arabs?
Schoenbaum raises a lot of questions like these and throws a mass of
semi-digested data at the reader from various angles but he declines, coyly,
to provide intelligible answers. Indeed, his only conclusion appears to be
that the American-Israeli relationship is 'more special than most.' This is
not news.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: The Mughals in miniature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This brilliant illustration of the Mughal ruler Humayun giving audience in
his tent comes from J. M. Rogers's attractively written Mughal Miniatures
(British Museum Press; Pounds 9.95; 128 pages.) It is one of a new series of
short highly illustrated guides to Islamic art by experts in their fields;
Persian painting, metalwork and, soon to appear, tiles.
The art of Mughal India in the 16th and 17th centuries is a terrific
subject, and Professor Rogers's book is broader in scope than one might
think, thanks to his emphasis on the personalities of the emperors, Akbar,
Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Awrangzib. Their voracious appetite for art yielded
little to Habsburg or Medici contemporaries. Emperor Akbar's library of
24,000 volumes is estimated to have cost three times the sum he spent on
building the city of Fatehpur Sikri.
The strangeness of Mughal art, with its bizarre Dureresque Crucifixions, is
explicable when we read about Akbar's and Jahangir's real love of European
art. They even ordered copies of famous Roman images of the Madonna to be
displayed in public places.
Small wonder that the Jesuits misinterpreted them as thirsting for baptism,
whereas Akbar was set on a quite other goal, the imposition of his Universal
Religion.
Whether you are planning a visit to northern India or simply interested in a
fascinating chapter in the interchange of cultures, this is a book worth
having.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Motoring: Vauxhall Astra 2.0i convertible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN I HAD an Audi 80 cabriolet on test in June, the weather was so awful
that the hood never got opened, writes Stuart Marshall. Early July was
better, though, and the power-operated top of the Vauxhall Astra 2.0i
convertible (above) was open more often than shut.
This lively car rode well, shook only slightly when a wheel hit a pothole
and remained perfectly habitable, hood up, at a business driver's motorway
cruising speeds. Closed, it drove as quietly as a saloon and stayed dry even
during a near-tropical thunderstorm. It is a proper four-seater, although
the hood mechanism takes up so much boot space that four people could, at
best, take a weekend bag apiece.
Since an open car creates much more aerodynamic drag than a saloon, I
thought 27 miles per gallon pretty good because most of my driving was
either at speed on the motorway or in stop-start town traffic. The price is
Pounds 15,800, which includes a power-operated top, windows and outside
mirrors.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Gardening: Shady plants come into the open - Robin Lane Fox
concludes that the sun is less of an enemy than many growers have feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS it is this wonderfully cool summer, but I am learning to question
one of the great divides in gardening. We all ask: does a plant need sun or
shade? Catalogues mark the great divide with little symbols; dictionaries
are keen to tell you the answers. As a result, I have been scared of whole
groups of plants because they are supposed to prefer a shady existence. As a
non-shady character, I cannot give them that. I now find out that we are
freer than we have believed, behind barriers of our own making.
Some of these barriers may have formed round my misunderstandings. I am sure
I was once taught that auriculas needed shading when, in fact, these
wonderfully ringed and marked forms of primula are very much happier in full
sun. Perhaps I muddled the instructions. But I did not muddle them for the
yellow-flowered forms of clematis which are coming into their best.
Popular wisdom tells us to plant them in semi-shade, preferably facing east:
I still have it on their labels. I also have the plants. One of them, a
plain Orientalis, is doing its semi-shaded best, striving for more sunlight,
invading the eaves and showing, on the last count, three flowers facing
boldly to the east.
My other plant is the vastly better Bill Mackenzie form, which was noticed
several years ago by Valerie Finnis in the gardens of that great Surrey
plantsman. Facing due south, Bill Mackenzie also has scaled the drain pipes:
in full sun, he is smothered in flowers every year and shows not the
slightest sign of scorch.
Other re-thinks are more dramatic. In the next few weeks, one of the charms
of gardens in the west of England and Ireland are the dieramas and their
curving wands of deep pink or white flowers. Their popular name is Venus
Fishing Rod, and they arch over on to the soil like offshoots from some
heavenly cast. The flowers are like small gladioli, borne profusely on long
stems above leaves like rushes at the edge of a pond. Admittedly, the leaves
turn brown and linger on among the greenery; but the plants are enchanting,
fit for a goddess who would angle, no doubt, in the nude.
Everyone says a Venus Fishing Rod likes damp soil, and most people suggest
semi-shade because of the imagery of water and so forth. Wistfully, I have
avoided them in my dry, stony garden - but I have just seen a magnificent
clump standing in full sunlight on just as stony a soil in the middle of
Broadway, in the Cotswolds. Its owner confirms that there is nothing wet or
shaded about the position. Without any umbrella, Venus is fishing happily
and flowering madly in her beautiful white form.
Why, after all, do plants need shade? In Britain, very few need it to
protect leaves from too-fierce sun. What they actually want is water, and I
find that occasional cans of it will bring down all manner of barriers.
If you feed your garden properly in summer you will, in any case, be
watering these plants with Phostrogen from the hose or can, applied to the
roots and leaves. On dry days, feed them in the evening; and by wetting them
at that time, you will fortify them for exposure to all but the fiercest
sunlight the following day.
Beside paving stones, the old dogma about shade is often mistaken, too, and
for similar reasons. Leaves can remain in sun if roots can run coolly under
a stone parasol. I find that sun on these terms is entirely acceptable to
many epimediums or to schizostylis, with their lovely pink and white
flowers.
Even their expert growers told me that this experiment was stupid.
Nonetheless, they have flowered and spread for three years in my garden
without any light shade to protect them. They want cool roots rather than
sheltered leaves.
In most areas, shade is a mixed blessing, anyway. To the purists, it means
leaf mould, the damply-scented floor of a tall wood, or lightly-filtered
light along the banks of a passing stream. Collectors in the wild are likely
to put the indiscriminate label of shade-lover on plants which they find in
these natural conditions. Most of us cannot match them. For us, shade means
scrappy soil beneath a neighbour's sycamore or the backside of an unfavoured
urban plot. Why should anything prefer these conditions to decent soil,
within range of a hosepipe, in fresh, open sunlight?
On either side of any divide, there are always firm exceptions. My point is
that the frontier itself is arbitrary. Many good plants will flourish better
in the open with water than in the half-light among another tree's roots. In
both our kingdoms, human and vegetable, the most frequent reason for
'preferring a shady place' is identical: drink.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Motoring: The fear that won't go away - Stuart Marshall
explains how women motorists can cut the risks of being attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATISTICALLY, the chance of a woman motorist being attacked in her car is
said to be minute. But the fear is real. Incidents may be few but the
results can be devastating.
There is no complete answer, of course. But all women can take sensible
precautions to reduce the risk of either breaking down or being mugged in
their own car. Some are so simple they should be second nature, as routine
as fastening your seat belt before moving away.
Always drive with the doors locked. Then, a thief cannot open one when you
stop in traffic and steal your handbag - which should not be visible from
outside, anyway. Worse still, he might get in and hijack the car. Because
alarms and engine immobilisers are making them more difficult to steal,
hijacking is becoming popular with thieves in the US. Inevitably, it is only
a matter of time before it happens in Britain.
Never park, even for a minute or two outside a shop, without locking the
car. One in five of the almost 1.5m cars broken-into, stolen or driven away
each year have been left open, some with the keys still in the ignition.
Making life easy for a thief is irresponsible. Insurance companies now take
a hard line on claims for losses from unlocked homes. Cars are no different.
Next, breakdowns. Some, such as running out of petrol, are really
inexcusable. Yet, on a typical day, the Automobile Association alone answers
100 calls from members who have done so. Never ignore a low fuel warning; go
to the next garage. And remember that sensible drivers fill up long before
the light comes on.
Check the tyres now and again. Roadside wheel changes are usually avoidable.
If one tyre looks a bit soft, just putting in more air is asking for trouble
because sudden deflations nearly always start with a slow loss of pressure
caused by a nail. The leak can only get worse as time goes on and could
eventually leave you stranded on a motorway when an under-inflated,
overheated tyre blows out.
I suppose I am old-fashioned but I believe that, legal obligations apart,
motorists are morally bound to keep their cars in safe mechanical condition.
Regular servicing is essential.
Too many people do nothing to their cars except put in petrol and call out
the rescue service when they break down.
Just as there is active and passive car safety - not getting into dangerous
situations and surviving a crash, in that order - there is active and
passive car security. Active security is using your head to avoid trouble;
passive security is mostly about car alarms and engine immobilisers.
Increasingly, alarm systems are being fitted as standard by car
manufacturers but according to Ross Group, a maker and installer, many women
are confused. What, they ask, is the difference between an alarm and an
immobiliser?
Answer: an alarm sets off a siren and flashes lights if a thief tries to get
into a locked car. An immobiliser is an electronic cut-out to prevent the
engine from being started. The best and most expensive systems have both.
Other questions include:
Can I protect myself when returning to my car at night? Fit a remotely
controlled alarm like Gemini 5000 with a distress button. (Cost Pounds 199
to Pounds 349). You can set off siren and flashing lights from a distance if
you suspect someone is lurking near your car.
Is there any way of telling if someone has tried to break into my car so I
can be extra-careful and perhaps park it somewhere else in future? Yes. An
alarm with a status indicator will even show which protective circuit has
been tampered with.
Can I leave my children and dogs in the car for a moment after setting the
alarm without them accidentally making it go off? Some alarms have remote
sensor disconnection (RSD). For a short period, it will go off only if
someone tries to force the doors.
How can I go about fitting an alarm? It depends how much security you want.
Do-it-yourself installations start from around Pounds 60, or a specialist
will fit one at his workshop or your home. Call Homefit on freephone
0800-378 400 for details. If you plan to have an alarm fitted, consult your
insurance company. Many offer discounts on both premiums and the cost of
installation.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Property: The beauty that makes Wales so hard to resist -
Gerald Cadogan finds cottages the best bet in a country closer to England
than France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW roads make it easier than ever to reach Wales
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from middle England, especially. With a short drive, you are in a foreign
country where names are hard to pronounce and people talk and sing a
language incomprehensible to outsiders.
Far closer to England than France, Wales is just as stimulating a change,
although there is one hitch. If you are English, there is a chance that a
tiny minority of Welshmen - who do not like English people buying second
homes there - may burn your holiday cottage. Still, it happens less than it
did a few years ago.
How do you avoid such a fate? As one Welshman told me: 'Do not pay over the
odds for your house so that you are contributing to a property market that
many local people cannot afford. And do not arrive with a car load of
groceries from an English supermarket. Use the local shops.'
Occasional arson apart, the country is glorious. North Wales is like a
miniature Scotland without the midges and Anglesey flat like Ireland, with
low stone walls around white-painted cottages. There is a noble parade of
castles, ranging from the mighty creations that Edward I built at Conwy and
Caernarfon to subdue the country to oddities like the Normanesque granite
pile of Penrhyn, erected last century on the profits of a neighbouring slate
quarry.
On the the A55 north Wales highway, it takes barely 40 minutes to reach
Anglesey from Liverpool and Manchester, and the A483 connects with it to
give a fast link for drivers from Oswestry, Shrewsbury and points in England
via the A5 and M54. West of Shrewsbury, the Welshpool bypass is about to
open, while south Wales waits for the second bridge over the Severn to end
delays at the present bridge on the M4.
Cottages are the best bet in Wales. Houses of manor, rectory or large
farmhouse size are few and tend to be 19th century, while stately homes are
still scarcer. This is because, until the industrial revolution, Wales never
had the wealth that England enjoyed. Thus, grand houses were not built.
For potential buyers, where better to start than the former chapel and
chapel house at Dernol, between Llangurig and Rhayader in the Wye valley of
mid-Wales. On offer from Morris Marshall &amp; Poole for Pounds 44,000, it could
not be more Welsh. The stone chapel with slate roof has outline planning
permission for conversion with the adjoining cottage as a single house. But
use as licensed premises is forbidden.
From the same agent for Pounds 110,000 is a 1907 Arts and Crafts-style house
in the middle of Llangurig Penybont. The price includes a coach house (if
that is not sold separately for Pounds 25,000).
On the opposite (west) side of the Cambrian Mountains, Hafod Mansion Gardens
in Pontrhydygroes 14 miles from Aberystwyth, has specimen trees and two
acres of walled gardens. Price: Pounds 138,000, from Shearer and Morris. And
in Cemmaes, the Machynlleth office of the firm offers the Georgian
Aberhiriaeth Hall with five bedrooms for Pounds 220,000.
South from Aberystwyth in the Cothi valley, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has a
farmhouse and two cottages at Edwinsford as three lots with fishing (two
rods per property) on the river. The Cothi is especially good for sea trout.
Prices are Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 250,000.
In west Wales, Cliff House at Laugharne was re-built in 1986 after a fire.
It has views across the Taf estuary and Carmarthen Bay to Pembrey Sands and
Worms Head on the Gower peninsula while below, on the water's edge, is the
Boathouse of poet Dylan Thomas. Agent Terry Thomas is selling it for Pounds
250,000. On the nearby Towy estuary, the same agent offers the Edwardian
brick Pilroath at Llangain for Pounds 205,000; it also has views of
Carmarthen Bay.
Inland, near Abergavenny, Elstons has Pantybeiliau, an 1840 late-Georgian
stucco house with eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, walled garden, paddocks,
and views over the Usk valley towards the Black Mountains. Near the Roman
site of Caerleon and five miles from Usk is Llwyn Celyn (also Elstons),
another stuccoed property with nine bedrooms but just three bathrooms. Both
houses cost around Pounds 500,000, depending on how much land is included.
If you want to fish on the Usk, Mardy Cottage at Llanwenarth Citra, near
Abergavenny, is not a cottage but a house with half a mile of single-bank
angling. Halifax is the agent and the price around Pounds 185,000.
Llanarithon, at Howey near Llandrindod Wells, is a brick and stone farmhouse
on the Welsh borders. It is detached from its farmland and has only eight
acres (for Pounds 225,000, from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or Russell Baldwin &amp;
Bright). But up to 175 more acres, and modern agricultural buildings, are
available if you want to farm.
In north Wales, Hillway is a 1930s' seaside house with nine acres
overlooking the Dwyryd estuary at Morfa Bychan, near Porthmadog . Gardens
flourish in this sun trap and the price (from Jackson-Stops) is an
attractive Pounds 185,000.
If you want high ground and a studio barn, the same firm offers Creua, at
nearby Llanfrothen, for Pounds 175,000. A 7.25-inch railway, built by the
present owner, runs round the garden and is also available - but the
locomotives are not.
Further inland is Hafod Tan-y-Graig, in Snowdonia national park. This
substantial Victorian gabled house in seven acres of woods and garden is
offered by Jackson-Stops for Pounds 245,000. Here, you can fish for trout in
the river Edno, go for walks, climb mountains - and see what a beautiful
country Wales is.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Travel: Speed to Calais and miss France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEEPING OFF the motorways pays immense dividends in France. My preference at
Tours, for example, is always to take the road for Le Mans, for a drive to
the Channel that is both shorter than the motorway route to Calais and
infinitely more entrancing.
Mind you, at Le Mans itself you can miss the old town altogether by taking
the ring road. Le Mans cathedral is breathtaking: half Romanesque, half
Gothic.
A countryside of polled willows, poplars, meadowlands and watermills
separates Le Mans from Alencon, the birthplace of St Theresa of Lisieux, who
died of tuberculosis in 1897 aged only 24.
Something to relish is the cathedral at Ses, 19km further north. The road
curves around the city and climbs up to this glorious building with its
twin, crocketed west spires, its flying buttresses and gargoyles, one of
which vulgarly vomits the rainwater. The buttresses, added in the 19th
century, are the sole addition to the building since 1330.
Well worth visiting is the Haras du Pin, a few kilometres due north of Ses.
Here is France's national stud, founded by Louis XIV's chief minister,
Colbert, in 1665.
Argentan, 12km east, is where the battle of Normandy ended on August 19
1944. Here, too, Henry II learned that Thomas Becket had excommunicated him.
The English connection grows increasingly stronger as you approach the
coast. At Falaise in 1027 William the Conqueror was born William the
Bastard. His father was Duke Robert III of Normandy, known as Robert the
Devil, his mother a tanner's daughter named Arlette.
In the white-walled, half-ruined castle the guide will show you the window
through which the duke first spied Arlette washing her clothes in the river,
though the same guide usually adds that the window was only constructed six
centuries later.
Caen is not a port, and to reach the ships you need to drive a little
further towards Ouistreham. Ouistreham has a fortified 12th century church.
It also has a casino and a marina, as well as excellent restaurants.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Travel: Where the quiet inlets lap the green hills - Peter
Marsh finds a cure for his worries beside the Kingsbridge estuary in south
Devon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is governed by charmless incompetents; you are seriously worried by
the Pounds 50bn budget deficit; Ted Dexter is more annoying each day.
A cure for all these concerns is to sit outside the Old Stable Kiosk in
south Devon and gaze at one of the most tranquil scenes in England. You get
to the Old Stable by taking a five-minute ferry ride across the mouth of the
Kingsbridge estuary from the pretty town of Salcombe. A short walk from the
landing stage is a small shed-like building next to a grassy hillock
overlooking the water.
Inside this ancient structure, converted into a cafe, are two elderly women
with pinafores who will smilingly serve you a cup of coffee or an ice cream.
Additionally, to take home for supper later, you can help yourself to
locally grown potatoes and tomatoes, leaving the money in a jar.
From your wooden bench on the hillock, you take in the small, white houses
of Salcombe climbing up the hill on the other side of the water. There is
the great expanse of the estuary itself, its various inlets pushing back
like the protrusions of a star fish into the green background of gently
rolling hills.
Ahead of you is a mass of sailing boats, gently cutting to and fro across
the inlet, and over to your right the famous Salcombe lifeboat, its proud
yellow and blue hull at rest above the bobbing waves.
Further away, towards the open sea of the English Channel to your left, the
undulations of the land on the other side of the estuary are somewhat
craggier, with perhaps the faintest hint of mist blowing in.
Below where you are sitting is a small beach. It is difficult to tell from
here, but its sand has just the right clingy consistency to make quite grand
castles, or even miniature cathedrals. Small figures race about.
It is a blissful spot. I must have sat there 20 times and each time leaving
is more difficult. The main point of going to the South Hams area of Devon
is to visit places like this. The area is exceptionally beautiful. Perhaps
because it is some way from the main tourist towns and has few big hotels,
it has not been spoilt by visitors.
It is apparent from the restrictive nature of local planning rules that the
planning officers of South Hams District Council want to keep things this
way. I have never met them, but assume they are tough-minded individuals who
would sooner die than allow the merest hint of mass tourism to sully their
region.
The best way to appreciate South Hams is to rent a cottage or house for a
short spell. The tourist office at Kingsbridge, the main town of the region,
keeps a useful list. It is from Kingsbridge, too, that you can take boat
trips on the estuary that dominates the area. Contact the River Maid ferry
company for details.
Many of the special places in the area offer a similar combination of
rolling hills, sky and water to that found at the Old Stable. A few miles to
the north-west of Salcombe is the coastal village of Thurlestone, which
boasts one of the most scenic golf courses in England.
You do not have to be a member of Thurlestone golf club to follow the
cliff-top path snaking round the course overlooking the sea. If you can, go
there on a rough, grey day when the waves are battering the rocks and the
sea looks like frothed milk.
Slightly to the north of Thurlestone, connected by a sandbar to the small
village of Bigbury-on-Sea and isolated at high tide, is a grass-covered hunk
of rock known as Burgh Island. It is a haven for sea birds; there are
virtually no buildings apart from a highly-regarded hotel.
Burgh Island exerts a powerful and memorable fascination. Studied at length
at different times of the day through binoculars, the island's contours and
colours seem to change depending on the position of the sun, the volume of
cloud and the spray of the sea. Watching these slow changes over a period of
hours is little short of dramatic.
There is one other place worth mentioning: from the village of Aveton
Gifford walk along the tidal road that takes you next to the lonely,
glorious River Avon in the direction of the sea. Watch out for bird life and
also the incoming tide. A cap of mine blew off in this spot some years ago.
It is probably still there, rotting in the mud and the reeds. I cannot think
of a better resting place.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Scullery skulduggery - The odd case of the
photocopied recipes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE desk in the busy office of one of London's top chefs sits a pile of
correspondence between the restaurant's solicitors and a Citizen's Advice
Bureau and an envelope containing a week's wages and a P45 awaiting the
return of a young chef.
The restaurant's head chef, who has a quite distinctive style, would be only
too happy to hand these over personally if he could receive in exchange what
he believes is rightly his: the copies of the recipes made without
permission during this particular young chef's four-week apprenticeship.
In many other trades and industries this story could easily appear under the
headings 'industrial espionage' or 'theft of intellectual property' but in
the catering business such phrases cannot be used. Recipes set restaurants
apart and fill tables but it would take supreme arrogance to lay claim to
'an original recipe'. Just by changing small amounts of the basic
ingredients anyone can formulate another 'original recipe'. Often what holds
back young chefs is the lack of a repertoire of proven dishes. One answer
could be to copy them.
So how can you protect your own recipes? Unless, as chef, you are going to
make everything yourself, you have to share your recipes with your staff
and, to maintain their consistency, put them down on paper or on floppy
discs (word processors have been almost as big a boon for the busy head chef
as the food processor for his commis chefs).
As head chef you must accept that you only achieved your exalted position by
working first under a number of other chefs who were prepared to pass their
knowledge on. On the way up you can take advantage of the catering
industry's high turnover of personnel. But once you reach the top this
becomes less of an advantage and more of a hazard.
Chefs around the world try to protect themselves in two ways. The first is
the trust that they show their staff and which they hope is reciprocated. In
a busy kitchen - which may be densely populated from 8am to midnight seven
days a week - it is hard to conceal anything. The names of your suppliers,
your recipes and even your projected gross margins are open secrets.
Equally, it is hard for a spy to find a quiet corner to scribble down the
kitchen's secret formulae.
But if you do manage this once you are unlikely to repeat the success.
Although an impressive curriculum vitae helps secure promotion, it is not as
important as a good reference. In their evaluation of their staff, chefs are
frighteningly honest and always willing to air their opinions.
In this particular case, the head chef checked the applicant's references
with her former employers and put her to work on a four-week trial period on
the basis that, if a permanent position became available, she would stay for
a minimum of a year. There were, initially, the usual difficulties, mainly
to do with the speed of her work and one or two complaints from fellow chefs
that she was spending too much time copying recipes rather than working from
the master recipe file. When she was confronted, the apprentice said she had
just copied basic pastry recipes rather than anything more significant.
The restaurant later deduced that the young chef had managed to copy
approximately 150 of the restaurant's recipes by duping the rest of the
kitchen into thinking she had the head chef's permission. She did this in
the early evening when the proprietor went home between the lunch and dinner
shifts. When the head chef, impressed by the applicant's obvious passion for
bread and pastry, offered her a full time job he was therefore most
surprised to be rebuffed. The apprentice would no longer commit herself for
a year, as she had originally promised she would, and walked out.
The head chef was naturally hurt and saddened by his misplaced trust and
mistaken professional judgment. When, shortly afterwards, he met fellow
chefs including Albert Roux, Rowley Leigh, Simon Hopkinson and Alastair
Little around the lunch table one suggested recourse to lawyers, which has
yielded the return of some recipes, but the others could offer nothing more
concrete.
Even the best kitchens, it seems, have failed to create a recipe that will
replace trust in one's fellow man.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Sport: Formula One sees trouble in the mirror - The grand
prix elite are desperate to win back fans and sponsors and head off a threat
from north America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST weekend, at the German motor racing grand prix at Hockenheim, the elite
teams of Formula One finally accepted that they had been overtaken by market
forces.
At the end of a six-hour meeting during which, in a rare spirit of
compromise, 'every team gave up something', according to
championship-leading team principal Frank Williams, they agreed to abandon,
from the start of next season, much of the technology which has long been
claimed as a large part of the sport's raison d'etre.
Fisa, motor sport's world governing body, still has to ratify the deal. But
Max Mosley, Fisa's president, believes the result of the leading teams'
sacrifice will be cheaper, closer and more enthralling racing.
In the Fisa scenario, more teams will be able to afford to compete
effectively and drivers will once more be in total control of their cars,
rather than sharing them with electronic systems. The leading teams had
little choice. To have rejected the deal would have been to plunge grand
prix racing deep into crisis at a time when the globalisation of television
is allowing potential rivals for sponsors' dollars to emerge.
The most notable rival is north America's IndyCar championship in which last
year's grand prix champion, Nigel Mansell of Britain, now competes. Even
Frank Williams acknowledges that F1 needs to offer spectators more.
Critics argue that the sport offers poor value for spectators. The racing,
they say, is often processional, admission prices are excessive and there is
an unacceptably elitist attitude towards the paying public.
'Admission and a grandstand seat at Silverstone this year cost at least
Pounds 117,' says one observer closely involved with IndyCar. 'At Laguna
Seca (an IndyCar circuit) you simply can't spend more than Dollars 75
(Pounds 50.30).
'For that you get to see, and maybe speak to, the drivers and watch the
crews working on their cars. At Silverstone I almost felt guilty being
inside the paddock watching all these guys, who'd paid all that money, with
their noses pressed to the mesh fence and hoping for maybe a glimpse of one
of their heroes.'
One small sign that grand prix racing is already responding to such
criticism was the grudging parade of drivers reinstated after many years at
Silverstone. But the sport still has a long way to go.
The attendance at Silverstone was 60,000 - half last year's crowd.
Admittedly, Mansell was absent, recession in the UK had taken another year's
toll and attendances at other grands prix have not been as hard hit.
Nevertheless, the spectacle at Silverstone was enough to furrow brows at a
time when sponsors are more determined to gain value for money.
Mosley says that the cost savings of the technology ban should be
substantial. He estimates that some changes introduced at the start of this
year, such as fewer permitted tyres and reduced practice times, will have
saved each team between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m by the end of the season.
He calculates that the new rules will save teams between Pounds 2m and
Pounds 10m a year. The combined changes should thus lead to cost savings of
25-50 per cent. The benefits will be greatest for the smaller teams.
'At the moment, that team can go to a potential sponsor and almost certainly
will be asked if it's got 'active' suspension. It's obliged to say No
because it can't afford it, and the potential sponsor won't back it because
it hasn't got it. That kind of problem will disappear with the new rules,'
says Mosley.
Almost certainly, the technology ban will have little or no effect on the
outcome of future grands prix: Williams, McLaren and their ilk are still
likely to be winners because they will continue to work more effectively and
efficiently with the technology and resources available.
At best, the gap between the first and last cars will close. But Frank
Williams says Fisa may have miscalculated on technology costs. 'In reality
we haven't spent a great deal of money on our technology; it's been mainly
brain power.'
And he warns that there is a potential downside. A lot of companies who
currently sponsor grand prix racing, such as computer and electronics groups
Bull (Williams) and Hewlett Packard (Benetton) are heavily technology-based.
'Clearly they are not pleased and will have taken note', says Williams.
Should companies like these reduce their involvement, grand prix racing is
likely to become more dependent for its funding on companies with no direct
involvement in motor sport or the motor industry.
Furthermore, sponsors may seek to impose on teams cost-containment of their
own. Warning signals are already flying. Philip Morris, whose Marlboro
livery is synonymous with that of McLaren, is one of motor sport's most
consistent supporters.
In the last few weeks Walter Thoma, president of Philip Morris Europe, has
made thinly-veiled criticisms of those leading teams, by implication McLaren
included, who have sought to preserve the status quo.
'It is important that we understand the need for cost containment in Formula
One. There are one or two self-interested groups within the sport that pay
no attention to the world recession.'
He also maintains that there must be containment not just of the teams'
costs and their technology, but of the whole infrastructure. 'Why must there
always be three-day events? Can some not be run on a Saturday and a Sunday?
Why not run shorter races? How much shorter should they be? Is the show
pricing itself ahead of inflation? . . . when we look at the future, we must
consider the totality and not just isolated issues.'
On the surface, when compared with IndyCar, grand prix racing certainly
appears self-indulgent. As David Peevers, publisher of IndyCar 93 magazine,
points out: 'The very top IndyCar teams are on budgets of maybe Dollars 15m
a year, perhaps one-fifth of a top grand prix team's. And you can buy it all
off the shelf, from people like (UK-based) Lola for chassis and Cosworth or
Ilmor for engines. You're talking about maybe Dollars 500,000 for the car,
Dollars 50,000 for an engine - and basically that's it, you can be out
racing. It should be about two drivers pitting their skills against each
other, not sitting there on the grid worrying about which of the computer
programmers programmed their traction control that morning'.
Peevers' belief that IndyCar racing is more exciting than grand prix appears
to be shared by television. ITV claims that UK audiences of 3.5m watch its
Indy offering each week. That begs the question of how big the 'Mansell
factor' is, and whether interest in IndyCar racing outside north America
will disappear when Mansell retires or returns to F1.
A litmus test of whether Indy really is a potentially serious rival may come
in October. The IndyCar 'circus' will use this weekend's championship round
in Michigan to finalise an announcement, likely to be made next week, that
they intend to stage a non-championship race, Mansell included, at Brands
Hatch on October 10.
There are some difficulties: under arrangements within Fisa, Indy cars can
race only on ovals if they venture outside north America. Brands Hatch is
not an oval, but few expect Fisa to stand in the race's way; the exercise is
too fascinating for all concerned with motor sport. Will it be a sell-out?
Will it, in the end, be as nerve-wracking 'in the flesh' as its proponents
claim it is on television?
As the architect of the grand prix technology ban, Mosley says he does not
see IndyCar as a threat. Sponsors' budgets have been trimmed back this year
and face further cuts in 1994. The prospect of sharing the cake with an
emergent international rival should be worrying. But Williams says there is
little 'cross-pollination' in terms of sponsorship and that IndyCar will
remain too parochial to impinge on grand prix's financial patch.
In any case, he says, there are 'vast numbers of substantial potential
sponsors of F1' which grand prix has not yet learned how to tap. In spite of
grand prix's slick public image, he says, its marketing skills still lag far
behind its engineering capabilities.
In Mosley's view, F1 has been saved from itself by banning, before they
arrived, such innovations as computer-controlled four-wheel steering. But
once the recession is over, Mosley himself wants the technology chase to
continue.
He wants to rearrange the technical regulations so that research goes into
areas such as fuel efficiency. He wants to see intensified work on
aerodynamics, particularly in the area between the bottom of the chassis and
the ground.
He wants to see technological development of fuels and fuel efficiency. Down
this route, he argues, lies not just better racing but a contribution to the
world's energy problems, and the continuing support of its motor industry.

SOPHISTICATED Australians do exist. Two wines to seduce classicists
intrigued, but still puzzled, by all the ballyhoo about antipodean vintages
are subtle, smooth South Australian reds which will not jolt any lover of
fine claret. Henschke's Abbott's Prayer 1990 (Pounds 11.64 from Lay &amp;
Wheeler of Colchester) is a gorgeous blend of Merlot and Cabernet that is
quite ready to drink but utterly convincing for the end of the century, too.
Greg Trott, of the Wirra Wirra winery, produces another top-quality,
ecclesiastically-named Cabernet blend in the prize-winning form of The
Angelus 1991 (Pounds 7.99 from Oddbins). Decant and admire.

Whatever happened to rioja? We all loved it in the 1970s when it was cheap;
but now that emergent Spaniards have pushed the price up, rioja has
languished somewhat outside its native land. The Rioja Gran Reserva Club
(managed by Adnams of Southwold on 0502-724 222) is an attempt to expose
some of the finest mature rioja to British palates. There is no membership
fee but orders must be for a minimum of a case (although two mixed cases are
available). Most refined and 'modern' of the selection on offer until August
31 is Campillo 1982 at Pounds 172 a case - but do we want modernity of our
rioja? Rather more traditional in both flavour and structure is the fragrant
Carlos Serres 1985 at Pounds 141. Bargain hunters might consider the wide
range of 'oaked' (although not necessarily barrel-aged) cheap Spanish reds.
Victoria Wine's Casa Barco at Pounds 2.65 could do the trick for rioja
nostalgics.
* * *
Bravely ignoring vintage port prices in the saleroom, the shippers have
launched the 1991s - and jolly nice they are, too. Of big shippers, only
Taylor has declined to 'declare,' a decision presumably not unrelated to the
fact that 1992 was the company's tercentenary year. Other promising examples
at a recent London tasting included a well-priced Smith Woodhouse, a
distinctive Niepoort, an exciting Quinta do Noval, a suave Graham, a compact
Dow and a lovely, dense Warre. Merchants making special offers include
Adnams of Southwold (a six-bottle box of Dow or Warre is Pounds 80) and
Berry Bros of London SW1.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Cookery: Hearty fare to bring home the harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LANES are alive with the sound of machinery as combine harvesters chomp
their way through the fields, devouring the grain rapaciously all day and
half the night. Clank, march and munch in a blaze of headlights.
Although the manner of harvesting has changed greatly down the years,
harvest foods remain much the same. Lunch in the fields, now as then,
usually includes bread, cheese and some sort of pickle or relish. There are
meat pies for the fortunate and fruit cake for all, washed down with
home-made lemonade or ginger beer.
At the end of the day, as likely as not, there will be a good, honest stew
with plenty of meat and rich gravy. It is comforting and sustaining for the
workers and a sensible choice for the cook because it is easy to prepare,
can be left to bubble gently unattended, and will keep without spoiling if
timetables overrun.
Rabbit is the classic choice of meat, not least because this is the season
when they are best to eat and the farmer is keen to take his revenge. After
idle months devoted to growing fat and sleek on his corn, the safe world of
the crop is felled and rabbits are forced to flee the scene of their crimes.
It seems only just that they should run into the sights of waiting guns
before being popped into the pot.
HARVEST STEW (serves 4-6)
This is an old favourite given an aromatic new twist with lemon and fennel.
Marinating makes sense, irrespective of the age of the rabbits.
Not-so-youthful creatures will need tenderising and juveniles will benefit
from added flavourings.
Ingredients: 2 rabbits grown plump on harvest corn, cut into neat portions
(save the heads, rib cages, belly flaps and other trimmings for stock); 3
fennel bulbs weighing 6-8oz each, trimmed and cut into 6-8 wedges each (save
the feathery fronds for garnish and add the other trimmings to the
stockpot); 2 lemons (one separated into juice and zest, the flesh of the
other chopped into tiny pieces); 1pt stock made from the rabbit and fennel
trimmings; 5 tablespoons olive oil; generous  1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds,
bruised; 2 garlic cloves, chopped very finely; a tablespoon or so of flour;
1 x 50 gram tin anchovy fillets, drained and cut into snippets; about 3
tablespoons chopped parsley, preferably flat-leafed.
Method: Make the stock and marinate the rabbit in three tablespoons each
lemon juice and olive oil mixed with the bruised fennel seeds,
finely-chopped garlic and plenty of coarsely-ground black pepper. Leave in a
cold larder for 24 hours, turning the meat occasionally.
To cook, drain the rabbit joints well, reserving the marinade. Dust with
flour and colour in batches in the remaining two tablespoons olive oil in a
shallow, heavy-based stewpan or flameproof casserole. Remove and reserve the
meat. Then, saute the fennel briefly until streaked with gold. Set the
fennel aside.
Pour on the stock, which should be hot, and stir to scrape up the
flavoursome sediment from the pan base. When the liquid is bubbling well,
return the rabbit to the pot, add the marinade and the finely-chopped lemon.
Bring to a bare simmer. Cover tightly and cook over the lowest possible
flame for at least 1 1/2 hours. If the harvesters' supper has to be delayed
for whatever reason, the stew can be left to cook for up to 2 1/2 hours
without spoiling - although a fire-retardant mat could be advisable to
protect against sticking and burning.
Fifteen minutes before the end, check seasoning and add the prepared wedges
of fennel to the stew. Push them down between the pieces of meat, immersing
them in the gravy to heat them through speedily.
Finally, chop and mix the feathery fennel fronds with the parsley, the
finely-grated zest of one lemon and the snipped anchovies. Scatter the
mixture over the surface of the stew for added savour just before bringing
the dish to table.
Plain boiled potatoes or noodles go well with this. Alternatively, omit the
anchovies from the garnish and partner the stew with a crusty loaf of
home-baked bread and a pot of anchovy butter.
ANCHOVY BUTTER
Serve this, as described, with harvest stew or spread it on toast to eat
alone or to slip under poached eggs or grilled tomatoes. Small pats of
anchovy butter are also excellent for topping grilled steaks, for enriching
fish soups, and for anointing grilled fennel.
Ingredients: 4oz butter, at room temperature; 1 x 50 gram tin of anchovy
fillets.
Method: Dice the butter and put it into a soup plate. Add the anchovies, cut
into snippets, and mash them into the butter with a fork, gradually working
in half the oil from the anchovy tin.
Pack the butter into a pot, smooth the top, cover, and chill until shortly
before serving.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The appeal of a narrow view of life: A look at the revival
of Britain's canals and their colourful history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEREK AND Elizabeth Bradley walked the tow-path of the River Trent with
purpose. Ahead of them stretched nearly half-a-mile of boats, the biggest
inland waterways show ever held in Britain; but the Bradleys only had eyes
for canal narrow boats.
'I love the peace and sense of history on the canals, and the wild flowers
going past so slowly at eye-level,' says Elizabeth. 'My husband is coming up
to retirement, so we're here to look for a boat.'
So were many other people. According to Stephen Goldsbrough, chairman of the
Canal Boat Builders Association, the market is growing at a pace to make the
recession-hit marine industry envious. Eight years ago the association had
40 members. Constructing narrow boats was a folk art almost on a par with
coracle-building. Now there are 400 members, launching over 1,000 new narrow
boats each year.
Notions of 'camping-out' quickly vanish once aboard a modern vessel.
'Anything you have at home you can put in a narrow boat,' says Goldsbrough.
'We've just done one with a complete onboard office equipped with computer
and fax. Another client plans to spend a year touring the canal system
painting in watercolours, so one end of his boat is a studio with big
skylights.'
Exactly 200 years ago Britain's fledgling canal system was enjoying a
similar boom, although disapproving commentators of the time called it a
'mania.' In 1793 there were 62 canals in various stages of construction,
one-third of all those ever built.
As canal enthusiast Anthony Burton chronicles in his new book, Canal Mania
(Arum Press, Pounds 19.95) speculators drove prices up in a dizzy spiral.
Newspapers reported that Pounds 140 shares in the Birmingham Navigation
company were soon selling for over Pounds 1,000.
In 1792 prospective investors in the Grand Junction Canal were invited to
gather at an inn in Stony Stratford. The excited crowd was so large that the
meeting had to be moved to the parish church. A total subscription of Pounds
250,000 was needed but these eager 'parishioners' subscribed over Pounds 1m.
A fortnight later a similar meeting to fund the Leicestershire &amp; Northampton
Union overflowed even the town's church, and the meeting was adjourned to a
nearby field. London-based investors employed agents who criss-crossed the
country on horseback to give them a flying start on each new canal scheme.
Parliament, remembering the South Sea Bubble, anxiously debated canal fever.
Members wondered whether the English countryside would not soon be more
water than land. A motion was tabled proposing that canal construction be
stopped at harvest time, since so many farm workers were being lured off the
land to work as navvies.
The launch-pad of this feverish activity was the traditional grand tour of
Europe by a young English aristocrat, the Duke of Bridgwater. For him the
highlight of his tour was a visit to the Grand Canal of Languedoc (now known
as the Canal du Midi), completed in 1681.
Voltaire had described the canal as 'le monument le plus glorieux par son
utilite, par son grandeur, et par ses difficultes.' It was 150 miles long
and contained all the features later found in the British system: aqueducts,
locks and a tunnel. To a mine owner such as Bridgwater, the applications for
moving his coal to market were obvious.
In 1760 Parliament gave approval for a canal to link the ducal collieries in
Worsley with the factories of Manchester, half-a-dozen miles away. A young
self-taught engineer, James Brindley, was engaged for its construction,
which in turn nearly bankrupted the duke before it became a
revenue-producing project.
The rest is history. Within 50 years Britain was a spider's web of linked -
or parallel, and competing - canals. They flourished briefly as a commercial
freight system. But competition from the railways limited demand and
motorised road transport killed it.
As recently as the 1950s and early 1960s, canals were being filled in and
abandoned. Since then numerous groups, aided by the British Waterways Board
and enlightened local authorities, have reversed the decay; Britain's 'lost'
waterways are being revived.
Plans are in hand to restore nearly all the remaining 100 miles of disused
canals owned by British Waterways. It will complete a network stretching
from Taunton in the south- west to Lancaster in the north.
Landscapes, wildlife and industrial archaeology make the canal system a
phenomenon almost better-viewed as a linear national park. 'Slightly more
than 50 per cent of the UK population lives near a canal,' says Bridget
Atherton of British Waterways. 'They're not just for the enthusiast with a
boat. Canals are so accessible. You don't need a large sum of money to walk
along the towpath and enjoy it.'
Stephen Goldsbrough, who took orders for six narrowboats at an average of
Pounds 40,000 apiece during the Inland Boat Show, says that with around
23,000 boats on over 2,000 miles of waterway, there is still plenty of
potential for growth, in the sense of physical space. Whether the intensity
of access at particular spots may need regulating is another question.
'We're all of a sudden opening up a 200-year-old system to numbers of people
that it can't really cope with,' he says. 'Tow paths, for example, built to
cope with a dozen horses a day, are being worn away in some places. One
looks at the Lake District spending money to dissuade mountain bikers from
going there and it does cause you to wonder.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Fashion: Fading appeal of bright colours - A look at the
growth of a subtler, kinder aesthetic of fabric dyes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SITTING AT Henley a few weeks back I listened to two septuagenarian oarsmen
discussing, with a gravitas that verged on the comic, the comparative pinks
of their Leander club socks. 'Marvellous shade', one acknowledged, pointing
at the other's flamingo-hued ankle, and continued, 'the trouble is, mine are
new and still look rather garish even though I laid them out on the lawn in
the sun and rain for the last two weeks.' His companion gravely nodded in
sympathy.
The issue, of course, was fading. No self-respecting Leander man wants to be
seen in a brand new pink blazer, tie or socks, for long-standing membership
of the sport's inner sanctum speaks volumes. But the faded socks, while
losing none of their piquancy, did look a good deal better.
The incident reminded me of a tip I read in Lady Diana Cooper's memoirs, The
Rainbow Comes and Goes. Whenever she redecorated one of her homes she would
lay the new upholstery and curtains out on the lawns leaving the elements to
undermine the manufactured brightness. Even the most zinging Bloomsbury
colours were toned down, ridding the aniline dyes of their harshness.
Synthetic aniline dyes were invented in 1841 by the chemist C. J. Frizsche.
By the 1860s they were being mass-produced for dress and interior decoration
and reds and purples, historically the most expensive colours to produce,
became widely available. The Victorians latched on to their brightness with
glee because it had once been a sign of wealth and it became highly
fashionable among the nouveaux riche merchants to have mind-bogglingly
bright homes and clothes.
William Morris, the artist, led the inevitable reaction. He experimented
with natural dyes, particularly favouring indigo and madder because they
faded beautifully, reminding him of the Medieval tapestries that he so
admired.
Sadly, apart from a few sidetracks by craftsmen and aesthetes, garishly
bright dyes have dominated this century's palette, culminating in the
shocking pink, vibrant tangerine and other day-glo colours that fought for
our attention and our purses in the late 1950s. In recent years dye
manufacturers have actually prided themselves in creating colours that will
not fade and celebrities such as Jeff Banks advertise the advantages of
detergents that do not fade clothes in the wash.
Thankfully a new colour aesthetic is emerging of a subtler and kinder sort.
Some seek it in the faded charm of vintage clothes or Grunge, others prefer
the subtle and rich (rather than bright) colours and textures of designers
such as Issey Miyake and Romeo Gigli who are interested in the dye processes
of India and the Far East where natural dyes are still widely used.
It is rich, rather than bright, colours that fade the most beautifully and
it is a faded richness that tends to flatter northern European complexions
more than Matisse brights or those mushy 'pastels' served up in chain
stores. And many would argue that muted rather than poster-paint brights
look more refined. But sadly the mass market manufacturers are reduced to
pumping out these flat, hard colours that defy fading as natural dyes are so
expensive.
At a cottage industry level natural dyes are less harmful to the environment
but they are impractical on a commercial scale because, according to the
colour chemist Brian Burdett at Shirley Technology (part of the British
Textile Technology Group), 'the planet cannot grow sufficient natural dyes
to meet our needs and the application of natural dyes needs chemical
additives that are more harmful than synthetic dyes.'
Instead, his team is working on a cross between natural and synthetic dyes,
using micro fungi which produce pigments. The idea was born when one of them
noticed the colourful fungi that developed on the foam of home-brew beer
when it went wrong. Its appealing colour would dye the plastic container and
was difficult to remove.
Research revealed that mildews and other micro fungi can produce amazing
colours. The project has succeeded in creating colour pigments in cool
conditions, which require neither heat nor chemical additives. With the
application of environmentally-sound chemistry they will soon produce a
commercially viable dye. I hope it fades with charm.
Meanwhile Eric Bremner at Laura Ashley has also tuned into this
colour-tempering aesthetic. He will be introducing a mechanised fading
system in the company's printing works in Wales to recreate that oldy-worldy
look that so many admire in old fabrics.
This shift in aesthetics can do no harm to the environmental movement which
is trying to encourage us to get over our newness neurosis. Perhaps we will
all concur with the rarified sensibilities of Lady Diana Cooper and my
Leander friends - allowing the colour of our clothes to age gracefully.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Fashion: The bronze age sun worshippers take cover - What's
new under the sun? Avril Groom visits Cap Ferrat where the mahogany-tanned
beach bunnies are going the way of the dinosaur and the golden girls are
changing style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTOLLING the virtues of a plain black swimsuit to the women around the pool
at the Hotel Bel-Air in Cap Ferrat is likely to produce plain black looks.
They take glamour in the sun seriously here and they know that, in the
brilliant, bleaching light of the French Riviera, it is bright, or at least
a bold monochrome, that looks right.
Minimalist is not a term recognised in the discreetly indulgent atmosphere
of this cliff-top spot at the tip of one of the Cote d'Azur's wealthiest
peninsulas. And these practised sun goddesses have a point. In their
exuberant swimsuits, fringed pareos, fat Alice bands and jewellery, many of
them look marvellous. As John Betjeman believed, good taste can be ghastly.
On holiday, when fun and glamour are priorities, it can make you invisible.
The one way to ensure that a swimsuit oversteps the line that divides
flamboyance from vulgarity is to wear it with a mahogany suntan. Below the
Bel-Air's pool, in full sun on a windless terrace, the last of the topless
beach bunnies anoint themselves with coconut oil and fry, storing up a
future of health horrors and skin wrinkled like the dinosaurs which, in
fashion terms, they have already become.
Catching the breeze round the pool above are the wiser golden girls who take
refuge under the forest of white parasols that sprout beside each beach
lounger as the sun reaches its full height.
The loose shirts and sarongs that high-glamour swim ranges such as Gottex,
Gideon Oberson and La Perla have long provided as part of their co-ordinated
beach style are worn not just for propriety during lunch but as a matter of
course in the heat of the day.
As many British stores seem to think that autumn arrives at the same time as
the holiday season, finding such co-ordinates can be tricky if you wait, as
many do, until just before your holiday.
Harrods' swimwear department is there all year and has a full range of
Gottex swimsuits and beach separates. Both Fenwick and Harvey Nichols have
recently-arrived stock which has not formed part of their sale. Debenhams'
reasonably-priced (from about Pounds 20) high summer range will last
throughout August, Slix has just introduced its summer range and Issey
Miyake's Splash collection of non-crease holiday pieces is also a new
arrival.
These collections reinforce the pursuit of glamour with nostalgic,
1950s-inspired style - draping, ruching, underwiring, lower leglines and
even skirt effects all play their part.
Fitness-conscious women on holiday take swimming as seriously as sunbathing
and even ruched chiffon is now water-worthy.
The most starrily-clad Bel-Air resident can safely entrust herself to Pierre
Gruneberg, the swimming instructor whose way of teaching the water-shy by
calmly and firmly making them put their heads under water and control their
breathing has made him more famous than his glittering pupils. Women, he
says, hate getting their hair wet but these days they have no excuses:
floral bathing cap and turban are hot fashion items.
Jewellery is also part of the glamour canon and gold is flattering to a
golden skin. Jewellery, like the tan, is toned down this year, to a
substantial but discreet chain or bracelet of the real thing to wear by pool
or beach and a matt gilt costume-jewellery bangle to jangle at lunch. Mappin
and Webb's Spirit of Gold British-designed collection is an interesting
source of well-priced pieces.
A paler shade of bronze may be fashionable but skin needs as much attention
to keep it supple as in the days of darker tans. Apart from suncreams of a
suitable protection factor, generous after-sun moisturising is essential,
preferably an almost perfume-free one such as Decleor's Fraicheur Apres
Soleil. This will blend successfully with the moisturising after-bath
lotions that complement your favourite fragrance, with lighter eau de parfum
most suitable for warm weather. Just launched is the bath range to go with
last summer's successful scent - gardenia, hyacinth and fruit-based-Gio by
Armani.
Hair needs sun protection, too. Colourist Jo Hansford, who has just opened a
London shop, says all hair dries and fades in the sun, with tinted hair
affected most. She suggests a hat. Sun protection screens and conditioners
such as Schwarzkopf's Bonacure range help.
'Bleached hair is already damaged because the pigment has been stripped,'
she says. 'You don't want to exacerbate that effect. We sometimes have to
re-tint highlighted hair that has had too much sun.'
There are other traps which, if taken to extremes, could be disastrous.
'Lemon juice to help the sun lighten hair can turn dark hair orange,' she
says. 'And too much chlorine turns it green.'

YOU may think it is a skirt but anybody who has been to east Africa knows
better. A Kikoi is a bright cotton wrap that east African men wear around
their middles with panache and dignity writes Lucia van der Post. Practical,
tough and eminently washable, it is made from a long piece of cloth, 1 metre
wide. It is secured by folding in the ends, drawing them around the waist
and rolling the top down. It can be worn for sleeping, slopping round the
house, beach-combing. It is a perfect holiday garment - and you do not have
to go to Kenya to get one. Simon Friend imports and sells them in a variety
of colourways at Pounds 22.50. Coming in soon at Davies, 10 Great Newport

FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: The quick routes to browner, shapelier legs
 -A look at ways to reduce the shock when you take off your tights and walk
to the beach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S summertime. You are heading for the beach and your legs do not look
much like Julia Roberts'. What, if anything, can you do? Quite a lot,
actually.
You have probably left it a bit late for a serious programme of toning and
exercising but almost every beauty salon, health club and posh department
store has developed a range of treatments which at the least leave the skin
softer, smoother and better-textured and just may do a little bit more.
Harrods has remodelled, upgraded and altogether made much posher, its Hair
and Beauty Salon. More importantly, it includes a much wider range of
treatments. You could go in for something as simple as a pedicure and some
chiropody or, if you wanted instant toning, you could try special treatments
such as Ionithermie, Aromazone, Lymphatic massage or hydro-therapy.
This summer has seen a boom in the number of creams, gels and lotions all
purporting to turn lumpy, dimpled skin into blemish-free silk. I have tried
two - Dior's Svelte Body Refining Gel (Pounds 25) and Shiseido's Body
Contouring Complex (also Pounds 25) - and though neither made any
significant difference to my shape, the massaging the lotions require and
the oils and extracts in them, undoubtedly leave the skin much softer. They
are also remarkably unoily so that you do not risk spoiling tights, sheets
or clothes. Anybody thinking of spending Pounds 25 on such alluring
prospects should understand that no miracles are likely.
Probably just as effective at a fraction of the price would be using a body
brush (The Body Shop sells them for Pounds 5.50) to brush the skin on your
legs for at least five minutes a day.
One of our design team, Frances Trowsdale, tried out a few more. 'Decleor
has a night and a day treatment,' she says. 'I massaged the night one,
Decleor's Firming Body Oil (Pounds 18.30 for 50ml), into my legs after a
bath with a gentle body brush using circular movements as instructed. It is
a thick pungent oil and should be used at night but never before putting on
fine clothes. To my amazement the results were instant - soft silky legs.
'In the morning I used the Decleor Sliming Body Cream (Pounds 27.75 for
150g). This non-sticky non-greasy cream left the skin feeling firmer and the
circulation much improved - I feel all that massaging helps.'
All legs, of course, look better brown but now we know just how dangerous
sitting in the sun is the obvious answer is: acquire a tan before you go on
holiday. From a bottle.
Jill James tried some. 'The pick of the self-tanning lotions for my (very)
pale skin,' she says, 'was Estee Lauder's self-action tanning spray. It was
so natural - I tried the medium bronze colouring - that colleagues failed to
spot that I had a tan at all. A respray made them take notice. This was
because my arms acquired two shades of colour because of my inexperience in
applying it. But, where I had managed to get an even cover, it really did
look natural.
'The only snags with the spray are that it is difficult to apply evenly and
you are advised to leave one hour before you put your clothes back on. This
proved tricky on a busy Saturday morning in our house - milkman calling to
be paid, paperboy delivering the wrong magazine, son's friends wanting to
know if he can go swimming.
'For the face, I liked Helena Rubinstein's Golden Beauty self-tanning
lotion. Easier to apply than a spray, this cream gave an even, natural tan
and I might be tempted to use it as an all-over cover this summer. But a
word of warning - all the tanning lotions left my clothes stained and bra
washing was a real chore.'
In the city, even the best, brownest, longest legs look better covered. The
Sock Shop has splendidly light, flesh-coloured sheers called Cosmetics For
legs at Pounds 4.99 a pair.

FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Could amber be the choice for you?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU prefer your jewellery chunky, bold and ethnic amber may well be the
choice for you. Back in May I reported that amber was the stone of the
summer with Cobra &amp; Bellamy kicking the amber season off with a spectacular
selection of rich, raw and brutal pieces culled from the ancient fossilised
forests around the Baltic Sea.
Since then the choices have proliferated and you can buy amber jewellery in
many moods and at many prices. You can buy a small selection by mail order
from Muftec Consultancy, 27 Coval Road, London SW14 7RW. There are amber
rings (Pounds 28) and a good selection of ear-rings (ranging from Pounds 35
to Pounds 65) as well as bracelets (Pounds 85), brooches (Pounds 45 to
Pounds 65) and an amber and fancy silver collar (Pounds 95). All the pieces
uses silver for the setting and all are made from amber found on the Baltic
coast of Poland or Lithuania, each piece is hand-cut and hand-made. Write to
Muftec for a brochure.
Next and most branches of John Lewis are selling well-priced pieces from the
Goldmajor collection of amber jewellery - ear-rings start at Pounds 16.45
and for around Pounds 30 there is plenty of choice. At the top end of the
range the mosaic necklaces are quite spectacular.
At Manguette, 20a Kensington Church Walk, London W8, a small but charming
jewellery shop, there will be an exhibition of contemporary amber jewellery,
September 15-29, with contemporary designers such as John Bowman, Gatto
Bianco, Ashley Wheeler and Eileen Coyne. Prices range from Pounds 50 to
Pounds 2,500.
If you want something to wear with your summer wardrobe you do not have to
wait until September - Manguette always has a marvellous selection of amber
pieces. Available now is the stunning necklace, above, designed by Eileen
Coyne, made from Baltic amber, and selling for Pounds 795.

FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Real gems are too brash for the '90s - The
elegant and affordable costume jewellery that matches the new fashion for
flowing lines and softer fabrics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT the flashy, go-getting 1980s are nothing more than a nostalgic
memory and the lean 1990s are well under way, proper jewellery - such as
diamonds, sapphires, gold and platinum - is out of vogue.
While the power suits and shoulder pads required bold, glitzy jewellery to
match, today's softer fabrics and more flowing lines cry out for subtler,
less obvious pieces.
Ever-on-the-ball Fior, which has long had a reputation for making
finely-crafted costume jewellery, today has immaculate versions of all the
latest decorative looks at extraordinarily reasonable prices.
A glance in the window of either of Fior's shops probably would make most of
us pass by quickly, convinced that these glittering pieces were way beyond
our means. But study them more closely and you will find that almost all of
them are immaculate pieces of costume jewellery which look every bit as well
made as the real thing and sell at very accessible prices.
Fior employs the techniques the master jewellers use to make their haut
jouallerie. All the settings are hand-drilled, all the pieces hand-finished.
There are cantilevered bracelets, enamelled brooches, 'lost settings' (a
traditional setting for fine stones to make sure the claw is not seen, which
was used to make the flower earrings photographed above left) and fine
beading.
All the care and skill is there; only the intrinsic materials are different.
Whereas haut jouallerie is made from gold and platinum, from silver and fine
gem stones, the Fior versions use cubic zirconia, faux gems, rhodium and
gold plating.
All this, of course, has a remarkable effect on the price. Whereas a pair of
classic two-carat diamond stud earrings probably would sell for around
Pounds 900 if real, the Fior version of two-carat cubic zirconia is just
Pounds 60.
And when it comes to something as exacting as the diamante set of necklet,
brooch and earrings photographed above right, the price difference is even
more dramatic. The original 1930s set on which it was based probably would
sell today for somewhere between Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000, while the
version here sells for Pounds 506 (although the pieces can all be bought
separately: the necklet is Pounds 215, the brooch, Pounds 250, and the clip
earrings Pounds 41).
The lost-setting flower earrings beloved of Van Cleef and Arpels, hand-set
in silver gilt (and photographed above, left) are Pounds 400; centres can be
'rubies', 'sapphires', 'emeralds' or 'amethyst.' Pictured with the earrings
is a Romanesque bracelet in matt 18-carat gold plate for Pounds 65, a gold
and cabochon necklet for Pounds 155, and Roman coin earrings at Pounds 44
the pair.
Anyone familiar with what is a la mode in the swish Bond Street jewellery
stores will recognise the looks at once. There are the 'gold' and cabochon
rings and bracelets, the Romanesque pieces, the coin earrings, the flower
earrings, the Daliesque watches, and the sharper Paloma Picasso-style
pieces.
Besides selling ready-made versions of all the latest looks, Fior has
established a niche in making perfect copies of pieces that are too valuable
to wear. Many a celebrity lodges her real jewellery in the bank and goes out
on the town in Fior's handiwork.
Elizabeth Taylor commissioned Fior to make a replica of her famous emerald
and diamond brooch, while one of Britain's better-heeled dukes, after
discovering that it would cost him Pounds 10,000 to insure some of his
wife's jewellery for their holiday trip to Australia, decided to have a
precise copy made. It cost him Pounds 5,000 but he had saved another Pounds
5,000 and, as he put it: 'My wife has a ring she can go on wearing forever.'
The Fior shops are at 27 Brompton Road, London SW3, and 31 New Bond Street,
London W1.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Gunsmith over a barrel - A family
company which has lost its market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIBOR Takats has a lethal workshop. It is a repository of ballistic
hardware: the kind of place Serbian militiamen dream about. There are guns
galore: bolt actions, pump actions, double barrels, pistols, stocks, grips
and firing mechanisms by the boxful.
Sitting amid the stockpile and wearing his spectacles and crumpled cardigan,
Takats - a Hungarian war veteran - looks more like Gepetto, the benevolent
wood carver in Pinocchio, than a firearms manufacturer. Unlike Gepetto,
Takats' story is no fairy tale. As a teenager in Nazi-occupied Budapest, his
apprenticeship at Skaba and Plokl, the city's leading gunsmith, was
interrupted in 1944 when he was drafted to fight the advancing Russians.
The craftsman says he only survived because he was hospitalised with shell
shock. Captured and interned in 1945, he decided to flee Hungary after being
forced to 'loot furniture for the glorious Red Army'.
He escaped, only to be arrested in Austria by the British Army which was
screening refugees in the search for war criminals.
The detention camp near Klagenfurt proved to be Takats' gateway to business
in Britain; he was recruited at the camp as a volunteer worker for the
labour-starved UK.
Since arriving in 1948, Takats has built up one of the country's most
specialised gun shops. It relies on expertise gained in the back streets of
Budapest and in the more refined atmosphere of Holland and Holland, the
London gunsmith, where, in the 1950s, he repaired shotguns with pedigree
names such as Cogswell and Harrison, Henry Atkin and Thomas Bland.
Today, however, such weapons are not attracting buyers. Takats' own business
 -set up with a Pounds 9,000 loan more than 30 years ago to refurbish .303
rifles for the armies of newly-independent Commonwealth states - has lost
its firepower.
Looking round his workshop in Ware, Hertfordshire, the war veteran points
out a dusty print of a 19th Century hunting scene. It depicts a poacher
caught in a trap and is captioned 'A painful discovery'. The words are a
fitting verdict on many gunsmiths struggling to overcome the long recession.
Takats dates the beginning of his downturn to August 20 1987. There were no
interest rate rises or currency crises that Thursday; it was the afternoon
Michael Ryan killed 14 people and wounded 15 others with a Kalashnikov
automatic rifle and a pistol.
The government quickly tightened firearms law, introducing new restrictions
on sales and ownership. More importantly, perhaps, Britain's worst
mass-shooting undermined demand for sporting weapons. For many people,
shooting for fun had become socially questionable.
'The Hungerford massacre had a dramatic effect on demand,' says Takats. 'Our
turnover had been growing every year until the late 1980s. At one time we
sold 30 to 40 (shotguns) a month; it's now three to four a month.'
Since the peak, the company's income has fallen by almost 50 per cent, from
more than Pounds 130,000 to around Pounds 70,000.
Borrowings, meanwhile, have risen. In a calculated gamble, Takats, together
with his wife and co-director Connie and son Graham - who handles financial
matters - decided to diversify into fishing equipment and country clothing
in a bid to stem the losses on gun sales.
They arranged a Pounds 36,000 secured loan to finance the move, but it has
so far failed to generate substantial new business.
The recession has persuaded cash-strapped members of the hunting and fishing
fraternity to abandon brand labels in favour of cheaper alternatives. Hopes
that customers would buy Barbour rather than M &amp; S have been frustrated.
Rows of unsold waxed coats, bush hats by Woodrow and deer stalkers from
Christy's testify to the malaise.
'There's been a change in social trends and fewer people are taking up
shooting as a sport. The prospects are not good,' says Takats. The future of
gunsmiths across Britain would be further jeopardised by any changes in gun
control laws, he adds.
'Thirty years ago, you could sell a shotgun to a 12-year-old. It wasn't
classified as a firearm until the killing of Ginger Marks in the late
1960s.'
Marks, named by police as a gangland villain, was murdered with a shotgun -
prompting clauses in the 1968 Firearms Act forcing shotgun- owners to
license their weapons. 'Any further regulations would not help the business
at all,' says Takats.
This is not a plea from a businessmen seeking leniency from his lenders.
Fortunately, says Takats, National Westminster Bank, which loaned him money
at 9 per cent, has not yet turned hostile.
Nevertheless, its patience has been stretched by the company's inability to
repay any of the capital on its loan. Current turnover means it has the
funds only to cover interest charges.
'The bank wants to see some change by the end of the year. We'd better have
a good Christmas.'
Anxious to placate his bank, Takats has reduced his stock 'to a bare
minimum' and even refurbished old and rusted air rifles stored for years in
the shop cellar.
The discarded barrels lying on the workshop floor do not compare well with
the engraved and intricately designed shotguns lining the walls.
'My skill is that I can make components from solid metal with just my
hand-tools and my brain. That could die out. I will carry on for my son but
if things get worse we might have to sell up. It's not a success story, is
it?'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: An MP who won't answer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE writing repeatedly to my member of parliament about the
unprofessional manner in which the Inland Revenue has dealt with my tax
affairs, he either fails to reply or gets his secretaries to reply (clearly,
they have not bothered to read my correspondence).
I have asked for the matter to be referred to the ombudsman but, again, my
MP failed to reply. Can you provide me with the address of the income
tax/Inland Revenue ombudsman?
Second, is there an independent body to which one can write with a complaint
about an MP's attitude. It seems ridiculous that an MP can simply fail to do
his job for his constituents.
The address of the Revenue Adjudicator, Elizabeth Filkin, is 3rd Floor, 28
Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4SP. The phone number is 071-930 2292.
As a first step, ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR120 (You and
the Inland Revenue) if you have not yet seen a copy.
MP are free agents - indeed, they are even free to decide not to go near the
House of Commons between election and the next dissolution, and to ignore
all correspondence. Those who voted for them must accept the consequences of
their choice, as must all their other constituents. In defence of your MP,
we should point out that the volume of correspondence received by most of
them would overwhelm many business people.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax is more than income
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT FIVE years ago, my mother-in-law sold her house and moved into a
residential home. She was advised to invest the proceeds from the sale in a
National Savings income bond.
The interest from this is paid monthly without deduction of income tax and
is her main source of income.
In assessing her liability, the Inland Revenue has advised that untaxed
interest is assessed on a current year basis for the first and second year
of the income received. The third year can be taxed either on a current year
basis or a previous year, whichever is beneficial to my mother-in-law.
After that, the interest is taxed on a previous year basis until the
penultimate year. Then, it is taxed on the current year basis or the
previous year basis ,whichever is more favourable to the Revenue. In the
final year, it is assessed on a current year basis.
If my mother-in-law was to sell her income bond this year, the amount
assessable for tax would be significantly greater than the income actually
received.
Has the Revenue interpreted the tax legislation correctly? If so, what
should my mother-in-law do to minimise her liability?
Yes, what the tax office told your mother-in-law is an accurate paraphrase
of the relevant parts of sections 64, 66 and 67 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Although we have mentioned these capricious rules in our columns from time
to time over the years (because the 1988 Act merely re-enacted long-standing
legislation on this point), they do still unfortunately come as a shock to
some of our readers.
As you say that your mother-in-law 'was advised' to buy a National Savings
income bond, perhaps she has grounds for a formal complaint against her
adviser for not warning her that she would be taxed on more interest than
she would actually get if interest rates fell over the life of the bond.
If she read the National Savings Department's advertisements and/or
descriptive leaflet before deciding to act on the adviser's recommendation,
she might wish to submit a formal complaint to the department or to the
Advertising Standards Authority if she considers that the potential tax
charge on non-existent interest was not made sufficiently clear by the
department's literature.
She might also wish to complain to the Board of Inland Revenue about its
decision not to produce an explanatory leaflet on the odd rules for the
taxation of untaxed interest.
Finally, she might wish to send copies of her letters of complaint to her MP
although, unfortunately, the House will shortly be rising for its
exceedingly long recess.
The address of the Board of Inland Revenue is Somerset House, Strand, London
WC2R 1LB. The House of Commons' post code is SW1A 0AA.

   MY DAUGHTER'S husband has started to behave badly
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with the aim, I suspect, of gaining a financial settlement if it came to a
separation or divorce.
I am particularly concerned about two assets: (a) a house I gave my daughter
(value Pounds 60,000 after the wedding, value Pounds 90,000 now), and (b) a
personal equity plan of Pounds 50,000 in my daughter's name, which I funded.
The marriage was eight years ago and there is one female child aged two. The
husband has virtually no assets. Is there any advice you can offer to
mitigate this situation? We live in Scotland.
The house which you bought and gave to your daughter will not be taken into
account in assessing her husband's share of the matrimonial property, owing
to the fact that it was given to her.
The personal equity plan is slightly more problematical. It might be more
difficult to prove that you funded it. If, however, you are able to prove
that you did, then it would also fall out of the definition of 'matrimonial
property.' Accordingly, it would not be shared by the husband on divorce.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: 'Shell' stocks look ripe for
reincarnation - The potential for revival by moribund companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICOLAS PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWTH in business confidence in recent months has prompted talk about
reviving 'shell' stocks - moribund companies ripe for reincarnation under
new management. While this type of stock market activity has been dormant
for several years, it is not difficult to see why using such companies
should again become popular.
There are, after all, a considerable number of potential candidates which
have only just weathered the economic blizzard. There is also a new
generation of managers which, having served its apprenticeship in an
established conglomerate, is now ready to create one of its own.
Knowing there is potential shell activity around is tantalising to the
private investor because of the chance of making some very quick and large
capital gains. But where does the average private investor find 'shells'
before the all-important emergence of new management to transform that
dormant quote? How can the private investor shorten the time between making
a decision to buy shares and then seeing some take-over activity?
There is no certain method of picking either the right company or the right
time. But there are several steps a private shareholder can take in an
effort to reduce the odds from 'rank outsider' to 'short favourite' and see
more rapid results.
First, look at the capitalisations of the various companies quoted on the
stock market. Any entrepreneur seeking a suitable vehicle with which to
realise a stock market ambition will generally be seeking a company with a
low capitalisation, since it will not only be more affordable but its share
price will move disproportionately once other people realise what is
happening.
Therefore, rule number one is to consider only those companies with a
capitalisation below Pounds 6m. Before their transformation, such companies
as Bel Air Cosmetics, Polly Peck, Mellins, Excalibur Jewellery and DSC all
had values well within that limit.
Armed with the Financial Times, or the Stock Exchange Official List, and
ignoring USM companies, pick out only those companies which satisfy that
capitalisation limit. It will probably leave you with a list of some
250-300.
A further narrowing of the field is achieved if only those companies which
are making poor profits (or even losses) are chosen - strange advice from
which most sane individuals will tell you to steer well away. But there is
method in this madness. Companies which are well managed and producing
increasing profits each year are better able to resist take-overs and, in
any case, will not be capitalised at under Pounds 6m for long.
It takes time and effort to glean information on small companies' past
performance. The FT, Investor's Chronicle and the Business Library are the
best sources, and a few hours devoted to this task will be rewarding. But,
in a post-recessionary period, you will still be left with a formidable
number of companies from which to choose.
Watch price movements over a period, plotting these at least once a week on
some graph paper. A rising price, often over a period of several weeks, is
inconsistent with a company which has hit hard times. Someone always knows
more than you do; and while insider trading rules have limited severely the
use which can be made of 'price sensitive' information, an examination of
share prices and subsequent corporate activity suggests this legislation has
succeeded only partially.
When a company is on the receiving end of take-over activity, it is involved
in talks with its advisors (such as accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers
and bankers). People notice such things. But how does a would-be investor
know if two and two is being added to make five? An observer could, very
easily, draw a wrong conclusion - and that could mean a very expensive
mistake. Many years ago, William Pickles plc trebled in price and everything
looked set fair for a very profitable run - only for the shares to be
suspended and the company to enter receivership.
So far, we have achieved nothing other than risk money and have the dubious
pleasure of watching the share price gyrate until the company announces what
is happening. We need now to try to introduce some degree of certainty into
the selection.
By looking again at the financial press, company reports or information in
the Business Library, you will be able to find out who owns large stakes in
companies. If you seek out those where, in particular, the board of
directors has a holding (say, up to 30 per cent), you can be reasonably sure
that it might at least have the wit to know when it is beaten and seek to
sell its shares before the company goes bust. That directorial shareholding
could, therefore, become the all-important stake a budding entrepreneur
requires.
So, there you have it - a simple system. Below Pounds 6m capitalisation,
making losses/small profits, rising share price, and a boardroom
shareholding to help underpin your stake. What could be easier? Your way to
riches is assured - or is it?
First, you will have to contend with your stockbroker's stunned silence when
you ring to place your buy order. He will suggest so many other more
rational ways in which to invest your money. He could also be right. I can
remember buying my second tranche of shares in Excalibur Jewellery when the
price had risen from 11p to 13.75p. They subsequently went to Pounds 1.40.
Alas, his caution was all too prophetic when it came to Ramar Textiles.
If, however, you have decided to try the 'shell' game with a portion of your
funds, do not be dissuaded. Later, though, when you have established your
credibility as a shrewd punter, you could have to be careful to spread your
buying instructions over several brokers so that they do not start following
you, forcing you to pay more on subsequent purchases. How often have you had
a call from your broker suggesting you buy something because 'one of our
other canny clients has just bought very heavily.'
Second, you will have to be prepared to buy in relatively small lot sizes.
Gone are the days when you could pick up sizeable chunks of small companies
without being made to pay excessive premiums over the share price. But there
is often time, and your patience will be rewarded by being able to buy at
reasonable levels.
Third, you will worry that, if the price has started moving up, it might be
too late to jump aboard. An examination of many 'shell' operations reveals
that, almost always, the initial rise in share price is followed by either a
plateau or even a drop - presumably, as other investors get cold feet and
decide to pull out.
I referred, at the start, to the reincarnation of shell activity, which
pre-supposes there are dormant periods. How do you recognise when such a
period is about to descend on your efforts at making a fortune.
A wise old US investor suggested, many years ago, that 'when the bellboy in
the lift starts giving you share tips, you know that the market is riding
for a fall.' Nowadays, there are not many bellboys around so, for its modern
equivalent, beware the time when your bank manager gives you tips to buy
speculative stocks. They always seem to have yesterday's news.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Successes outweigh the errors - Unit
trusts / Morgan Grenfell European Fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European stock markets have offered fairly slim pickings since the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Many a fund was launched in the general
euphoria, only to suffer as German interest rates were kept high to meet the
costs of re-unification.
Morgan Grenfell's European fund has performed consistently well through the
turmoil. Not only is the fund top of the sector over the five years to July
1, with growth of 141.8 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested), but
it is in the top quartile (best 25 per cent) of funds in the sector over
every period published by Micropal (one month, six months, one and three
years).
The fund has been managed by John Armitage since its launch in 1988, when
Morgan Grenfell moved into retail unit trusts. Figures show the fund beat
the Morgan Stanley European (ex-UK) index comfortably in 1988 and 1989 and
did so again in 1990 (although both the offer price and the index fell
sharply that year). It had a poor 1991, underperforming the index
substantially, but picked up again in 1992 and is well ahead this year.
'I only like to invest in things with substantial upside. I reckon that
30-40 per cent of what a fund manager does is a mistake,' says Armitage.
'The successes have to go up a lot to allow for the mistakes.'
His biggest success was the Swiss watchmaker SMH, but the holding is still a
source of regret. Although the share price has increased fourfold since he
bought a stake, he sold part of his holding after the shares rose just 35
per cent, and did not get the full benefit of his original decision.
Armitage says he tries to be as eclectic as possible and, accordingly, does
not buy stocks that rise and fall automatically in line with the market. He
cites his purchase of shares in Norgeskreditt, the Norwegian mortgage
lender, at Nkr100 on the ground that the asset value was around Nkr220 and
the dividend yield was 5.5 per cent. Almost immediately, a Norwegian
financial crisis developed and the shares slumped to Nkr62. Given that
Norgeskreditt was a substantial holding in the fund, this worried Armitage;
but the shares have doubled over the past eight months and are 33 per cent
ahead of what he paid.
'In the European bear market of 1990-92, most investors wanted liquidity and
were willing to pay a premium for shares in large companies,' says Armitage.
He believes there is more value to be found among small and medium sized
company shares.
His focus is on stock-picking rather than asset allocation, although he
tries to fit stocks within an overall strategic framework. At the moment, he
is not overly bullish about continental equities, particularly in the 'hard
core' markets of mainland Europe.
'Markets are at levels which discount a return to profitability,' he says.
But he believes industrial earnings will remain weak as volumes and prices
come under pressure.
On the positive side, Armitage says: 'There is a crashing need for interest
rates to fall.' If this occurs, equities should benefit as funds flow out of
cash and bonds.
The fund's top 10 holdings are: SIP/STET (Italian telecommunications group),
Astra (Swedish pharmaceuticals company), Securitas (Swedish security
company), Parmalat (Italian dairy products group), Colruyt (Belgian food
retailer), Bank Julius Baer (Swiss bank), Christian Dior (French fashion
house), Ava (German food retailer), Scor (French re-insurance company) and
Fila Holdings (Italian sportswear group).
In terms of geographical spread, the Morgan Grenfell fund is underweight
(relative to the Morgan Stanley index) in France, Germany and the
Netherlands and overweight in Italy, Sweden and Norway.
The fund's current asset allocation (percentages in brackets) is France
(17.8), Germany (15.7), Italy (15.1), Sweden (14.5), Switzerland (9.2),
Norway (6.8), Spain (6.7), Netherlands (2.2), cash (1.6) and others (10.4).
At nearly Pounds 130m, the fund is one of the dozen largest in the European
sector. Only five other funds (Eagle Star European, Fidelity European
Income, Henderson European Income, Lazard European Growth and Providence
Capitol European) can match its achievement of top quartile performance over
six months, one, three and five years.
Charges
The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual 1.25 per cent. The
bid-offer spread is around 6.6 per cent at present. The minimum investment
is Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 25 a month via the regular savings plan.
The trust is Pepable at no extra charge; however, it pays no income and is
suitable only for those looking for capital growth.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: More help for small shareholders -
Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AROUND 1.66m people applied for shares in BT3. But how many of them also
will buy shares in non-privatisation issues? Probably considerably less than
two-thirds.
Although it has been estimated that British adults owning shares have
increased from 9 per cent in 1979 to about 25 per cent, more than 70 per
cent of them have an interest in only one or two companies.
According to figures from Proshare - of which more in a moment - private
shareholders in 1957 held 65.8 per cent of UK quoted shares directly, while
pension funds and insurance companies accounted for 12.2 per cent.
By 1989, and despite a spate of privatisations, the number of UK quoted
shares owned directly by private investors had slumped to 21.3 per cent,
while pension funds and insurance companies owned 48.8 per cent.
What explains this dramatic change? I believe it can be attributed largely
to two things: the considerable tax advantages given to pension and life
assurance companies compared with private investors owning shares directly;
and the belief by many people that, apart from privatisation issues, owning
shares is rather risky and best left to 'experts.'
Another reason why many private investors view direct investment with some
caution is because they have read about corporate scandals, such as
executives awarding themselves huge salaries for modest successes and being
given excessive payments to leave companies which they have brought almost
to their knees. What influence can an ordinary private shareholder have over
the general governance of a company?
City institutions have a number of powerful committees which make
representations to the government and can use the threat of their massive
voting power to work behind the scenes to encourage changes in various
badly-managed companies. But where are the equivalent committees to
represent private shareholders?
Many people also are unsure about how to buy shares. It is easy with
privatisation issues: just clip a coupon in a newspaper. But acquiring
shares in other companies can seem a daunting experience. Where can they
turn for impartial help and guidance?
Fortunately, there are now two organisations which seek to improve the lot
of the private investor: Proshare, and the UK Shareholders Association
(UKSA).
Proshare was formed last year and encompasses the old Wider Share Ownership
Council and the Stock Exchange Investors' Club. It offers a number of
attractive benefits in return for the Pounds 30 annual subscription.
I have been a member since the start and, besides an informative and
well-written monthly bulletin, I have received a number of other useful
publications. Especially helpful was Proshare's Guide to Information Sources
for the Private Investor. This ranked newspapers, magazines, newsletters,
radio and television programmes, and a variety of other information sources
according to their value for money, ease of use, simple language and
up-to-date information. It also gave brief summaries of the content and
nature of each information source, along with details of cost and how and
where it could be obtained.
Proshare organises events for members, too. These have included visits to
such companies as Granada, Eurotunnel, Pilkington and British Airways, plus
visits to the stock exchange and seminars on a variety of investment topics,
including options. Proshare members also get details of a variety of special
offers on products likely to be of interest to private investors.
Financial support for Proshare has been provided by the stock exchange, the
Department of Trade and Industry, a number of major companies and the Gatsby
charitable trust. But while it aims to 'stimulate fiscal initiatives that
will give the private investor equal taxation treatment with the
institutional investor' and will engage in 'promotional initiatives to
encourage more user-friendly and lower cost share distribution services,'
Proshare does not offer openly to aid shareholders in their relations with
particular companies. This task is done ably by the recently-formed UKSA.
The association is independent and gets all its income from subscriptions:
Pounds 20 a year for full members and Pounds 12.50 for associates.
Its main aim is to 'stand up for private shareholders' as well as to
'provide a forum for private shareholders to voice their concerns' and
'promote improved standards of corporate governance.' Already, UKSA has
submitted a number of recommendations to various industry and government
committees.
There are thriving shareholder organisations in Germany, Holland, Sweden and
the US, and UKSA aims to learn from them. I have joined recently and can
look forward to three newsletters a year, although the association hopes
eventually to produce between six and 12. UKSA also organises special
events, which have included meeting John McFarlane, chairman of the task
force established recently by the Auditing Practices Board to look into 'the
future development of auditing.'
I very much welcome the advent of these organisations. Perhaps it will not
be too long before the government heeds their advice and reverses the
seemingly inexorable decline of direct investment in shares by private
investors.
Further details of UKSA can be obtained from its chairman, Donald Butcher,
12 Burgh Heath Road, Epsom, Surrey KT17 4LJ. Details of Proshare are
obtainable from its offices at Library Chambers, 13-14 Basinghall Street,
London EC2V 5BQ.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Leaseholders get the go-ahead - Now,
they are free to enfranchise - but the problems are just starting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FLAT owners with dwindling and unmortgageable leases can look forward to
better times come November when a new law will entitle them to extend their
leases at market rates. But leaseholders of flats in badly-managed blocks,
whose situation was also supposed to be eased by the new law, may find it is
not the answer to their problems.
After a difficult passage through the Commons and the Lords, the Leasehold
Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act received royal assent this month.
It is due to come into force on November 1.
It is immensely complicated but gives flat leaseholders two basic rights: to
extend their leases or, if the block of flats and a proportion of its
residents meet certain criteria, to enfranchise - club together and buy the
freehold. This gives them the power to manage their own block and extend
their own leases as they see fit.
Some of the main conditions for enfranchisement are:
At least two-thirds of the flats must be let on long leases (more than 21
years at the time leases were granted).
At least 90 per cent of the floor space of a block must be residential.
At least half the flats where owners wish to enfranchise must have been the
principal residence of their leaseholder for the previous 12 months, or for
at least three of the previous 10 years.
The ground rent (not maintenance charge) must be low, which is defined as
less than two-thirds of the rateable value, or, if the lease was granted
after April 1 1990, not more than Pounds 1,000.
Two-thirds of qualifying leaseholders must agree to enfranchise.
If a block is converted, or has fewer than four flats, the landlord must not
be resident.
Some of the conditions sound unobjectionable, but they will stop large
numbers of leaseholders from enfranchising. The condition that a maximum of
10 per cent of a block's floor space can be non-residential will rule out
most of the 20th century suburban blocks built over rows of shops.
An unknown number of flats will fail the low rent test, particularly as some
landlords have set the ground rent deliberately at a pound or two over
two-thirds of the rateable value.
The residency test might stymie the hopes of leaseholders in many central
London blocks where a large proportion of the flats is owned by companies or
the properties have been bought as a pied-a-terre by foreigners or people
living in the country. Flats on the south coast and other popular holiday
resorts may have similar problems if more than a few in a block are used as
holiday homes.
Some blocks with severe management problems - excessive maintenance charges
and negligent landlords - may find that they are ineligible for
enfranchisement because the nature of the block or the people living in it
makes it subject to one of the exclusions. Individual residents would still
be able to extend their leases in this situation, but they would not gain
any rights over managing the block.
Even if a block and its residents pass the eligibility test, they must then
decide if it is actually worth their while to enfranchise or extend their
leases.
Owners of leases on high-value houses (also eligible for enfranchisement
under the new law) stand to gain the most. Surveyors estimate that owners of
some leasehold houses in central London could make Pounds 250,000 from
enfranchising their properties.
Holders of flat leases with only 20 or 30 years left have little to lose and
much to gain from extending them; their properties would then become
saleable and mortgageable. But anyone with a lease of 80 or 90 years on a
flat in a well-managed block could find that the amount of time and money
absorbed by the enfranchisement process would outweigh any gains. One
problem is that the costs involved in enfranchisement can only be guessed at
until the first test cases have gone through.
The amount leaseholders will have to pay for the freehold is based on a
calculation of the market value of the freehold of the block, plus the
'marriage value' - how much more the leasehold and freehold are worth
together than as separate items.
The law states that leaseholders must pay the landlord at least 50 per cent
of the marriage value. Many landlords are expected to hold out for more than
50 per cent, possibly as much as 75 per cent.
Many leaseholders will need to get a loan to buy their share of the
freehold. Arranging lots of small loans for residents of a large block could
be complicated and time-consuming, but the Council of Mortgage Lenders is
considering lending directly to companies formed by residents to buy the
freehold, which could simplify the process.
The other unknown cost factor is fees for professional advice. Leaseholders
are liable not only for their own legal costs and surveyors' fees but also
those of their landlord. The law states that these must be 'reasonable,' but
it will not be possible to define that until the ground has been tested.
Also, if a freeholder is unwilling to sell, it will be possible for him to
prolong the process - forcing the case first to a local leasehold valuation
tribunal, followed by the Lands Tribunal and then conceivably to the High
Court, pushing up fees all round.
If you and your fellow-leaseholders decide to go ahead, the first thing to
do is serve a discovery notice on your immediate landlord (who might not be
the freeholder) asking for the name and address of the freeholder and
details of other interests in the property.
The next step is to create a company to act as the purchaser, and to serve a
tenants' purchase notice on the landlord and the freeholder, giving details
such as the proposed price.
The freeholder will respond with a counter-notice saying whether he agrees
with the terms offered. If not, a process of negotiation follows.
If agreement cannot be reached within two months of the landlord's
counter-notice, the matter can be taken to a leasehold valuation tribunal.
The act has just been published and copies are available from Her Majesty's
Stationary Office. The Department of the Environment has an leaflet on the
subject. For a copy, telephone 071-276 3398. The department is planning to
publish a more detailed guide later this year.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Holdings cut again - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARD ON the heels of last week's significant sales in Logica, the same two
directors have been cutting their holdings further. Each has disposed of a
further 25,000 shares, bringing the total amount sold, over that extended
weekend, to 200,000.
Dealing by directors in Etam, the women's wear retailer, has been fairly
modest in recent years - some small purchases in 1990 at around 70p and some
fairly small sales last year at around 250p mark. But the sale by Jacob
Flatau, a non-executive director, of 400,000 shares is on an altogether
different scale. Shares in Etam have been on a strong upward trend since
late 1990 but, recently, it has been losing momentum. Earnings are forecast
to rise by approximately 40 per cent in the year to end-January 1994 and by
a further 15 per cent the following year. That sort of growth should ensure
the shares avoid any dramatic setback such as the ones seen in 1990, but the
upside potential already seems discounted at the ground level.
Court Cavendish was floated on the market on July 13 1993 and, despite the
issue being over-subscribed, ended the first day dealing at a discount to
the issued price of 225p. That discount has since fallen further and five
directors have bought a total of 16,300 shares at 187p. So far this year, a
number of nursing home companies have come to the market or raised capital.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THURSDAY both Royal Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum report their second
quarter results. Shell is expected to show a healthy rise in current cost
net income from Pounds 516m to about Pounds 760m. Results will have
benefited from a weaker pound, stronger natural gas prices in the US,
cost-cutting and solid performances from non-OECD countries. The biggest
question now hangs over the dividend payment, which will not be announced
until September 18.
This time last year BP announced a dividend cut and Pounds 835m of post tax
exceptional restructuring provisions. For the latest quarter analysts are
looking for replacement cost net income of Pounds 240m with a dividend of
2.1p.
Abbey National is expected to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 315m
after bad debt provisions of some Pounds 160m when it reports its interim
results on Monday. It is expected to be hit by provisions on French
operations, but show strong mortgage lending in the first half.
On Tuesday National Westminster is expected to show profits in the range of
Pounds 280m to Pounds 350m with a strong performance anticipated from
treasury and capital markets. The bank is likely to cover its interim
dividend for the first time since 1989.
Midland, whose parent bank HSBC Holdings reports on August 31, is expected
to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 200m on Wednesday, while
Barclays is expected to show recovery from losses last year to pre-tax
profit of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 170m.
The interims from Reed Elsevier, the international publishing and
information group on Thursday are the first combined results since the
merger of Reed International and the Dutch publishers Elsevier took effect
at the beginning of the year. That and a change of year end has made
analysts wary of forecasts but James Capel is looking for combined pre-tax
profits of Pounds 287m compared with Pounds 247m last year.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Another blow for endowments? - Norma
Cohen examines the implications of insurance tax changes proposed by the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is re-examining some of the ways long-term insurance contracts are
taxed - with some vexing implications for policyholders. The catalyst for
the review is the European Commission which, in its voluminous Third
Directive on Life Insurance, tries to set a level playing field in the way
policies are taxed throughout the community.
The Treasury has held discussions with the Association of British Insurers,
the trade body, about possible tax changes - a move that has unnerved
members of the industry, particularly those which sell long-term endowment
policies. It is preparing to air some proposals this October and make final
judgements by the year-end.
The EC directive seeks to scrap the so-called 'qualifying' policy which
exempts higher-rate taxpayers from having to pay tax on the difference
between premium payments and final maturity value. Only policies longer than
10 years fall into this category, and only those in which the sum assured is
at least 75 per cent of premiums paid. Thus, it is long-term endowments, a
product already losing favour with the public, which would be most affected
by the tax change. 'Life is getting more difficult for that sort of product,
anyway,' says Mike Wadsworth, a partner at consulting actuary R. Watson and
Co.
The change would add to the difficulties in selling such products, however,
because it would create greater uncertainty in predicting the final cash
proceeds to policyholders upon maturity. Guessing the individual's tax
status some 25 years into the future is almost impossible, and policyholders
who wished to use such policies to pay off mortgages would face even more
uncertainty about how much they would have to pay every month in order to
meet their final liability.
More broadly, though, the matter under discussion at the Treasury is whether
to scrap the present system under which life insurance investment returns
are taxed as they are earned but the final proceeds of any policy are not.
In most of Europe, life insurers earn investment returns gross of tax,
meaning they can actually show higher returns each year in some instances.
'I'd get better value from a French policy because, in France, I'd get
tax-free roll-up,' said Nigel Silby, a partner at Watson specialising in
insurance taxation. 'In some of these European countries, they actually tax
them quite lightly at maturity. In France, there is almost no tax if you
hold your policy for 15 years.'
Of course, as Silby notes, investment returns on long-term UK policies tend
to greatly outperform those of their European counterparts because of the
emphasis on higher-yielding equities. Continentals prefer bonds, in short.
But a shift could encourage British companies to set up European offshoots
which then sell their products back into Britain. J. Rothschild Assurance
has taken such a step already with its new, Dublin-based operation.
Watson points out that should the Treasury decide to require higher-rate
taxpayers to pay tax on final maturity values, it probably would offer
simultaneously a tax credit for duties incurred on investment gains over the
life of the policy. Failure to do so would amount to double taxation of
investment returns.
The Treasury has a dilemma, though. If it wants to move into line with other
European states and abandon year-by-year taxation of investment returns in
favour of taxation upon final maturity, it will have to face up to a further
loss in revenue. And with a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement
for the present year, that option is unpalatable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURENTIAN Financial has launched a critical illness policy called the
Lifestyle Security plan. The policy uses definitions for the main critical
illnesses - heart attack, cancer, stroke, kidney failure, major organ
transplant and coronary bypass surgery - drawn up recently by independent
financial advisers as a basis for industry standards. It will also include
benign brain tumours, paralysis, terminal illness, motor neurone disease and
multiple sclerosis.
Laurentian's definition of total permanent disability is based on inability
to perform 'activities of daily living' such as eating and dressing unaided,
rather than the inability to work, which is the basis for most companies'
definitions. This could mean that the cover is not as comprehensive in
certain circumstances, and makes it more difficult to compare with other
policies.
The policy can be taken out by anyone between 18 and 70, and premiums start
at Pounds 12.50 a month.

<TEXT>
JOHN GOVETT Unit Management has formed a Greater China fund by
reconstructing its Pacific Income fund. The new unit trust aims to achieve
capital growth through investing in companies with exposure to the rapidly
growing Chinese economy, principally through Hong Kong, Taiwan and South
Korea.
Managers will be looking for companies which have 10 per cent or more of
their sales, profits or assets located in China. In the case of South Korea,
which has only recently re-established diplomatic relations with China, they
will also pick companies with strong prospects of moving into the Chinese
market.
Initially, the fund is not planning to buy any of the mainland Chinese 'B'
stocks available to foreign investors. Instead, the heaviest initial
weightings are likely to be in South Korea, with about 40 per cent of the
fund, Hong Kong, with 25 per cent, and Taiwan, with 15 per cent.
Eventually, a proportion of the fund might be invested in the 'B' shares,
with other investments elsewhere in Asia and the Pacific rim in companies
with substantial interests in China.
The initial charge on the fund is 5.75 per cent, and the annual is 1.5 per
cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 a month.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Scottish Equitable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Equitable is launching a product which combines investments in its
cash and worldwide tactical unit trusts. The idea is that 30 per cent of the
sum is invested in the cash trust; monthly withdrawals are then made to
generate income which (since it represents return of capital) is tax-free.
The remaining 70 per cent is invested in the world-wide tactical unit trust,
with the aim of producing enough growth to more than recoup the income
withdrawals. Worldwide Tactical Trust was 15th (out of 115) funds in the
international equity growth sector over the five years to July 1, with a
return of 83.8 per cent.
There is no guarantee that the original capital will be returned. The income
taken can be up to 6 per cent of the total invested but, of course, the
higher the income level, the greater the risk to capital. The product has a
five-year term but there are no penalties for early withdrawals.
Charges on the investment are 5.25 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual on
the worldwide tactical trust; 0 per cent initial and 0.5 per cent annual on
the cash trust. The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Easier to complain - A new watchdog
for the financial services industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNHAPPY life insurance and pensions policyholders should have an easier time
pressing their complaints under procedures to be adopted by a new
self-regulatory body proposed for the financial services industry.
So far, the Personal Investments Authority exists only in name. But one of
the chief reasons for its birth has been the absence of coherent methods to
handle grievances.
For those seeking more than just an apology or modest redress, the present
system works poorly. Lord Ackner, in his just-published report on it, noted
that each of the three self-regulatory bodies for the industry - Fimbra,
Lautro and Imro - has different rules for handling complaints and varying
abilities to award compensation.
The future of the PIA is still unknown. But if it is established, the
ambiguities in the present mechanism should disappear.
First, all companies will be required to resolve a customer's complaint  -
albeit not necessarily to his satisfaction - within six weeks. Those who
remain unsatisfied will be able to approach an independent conciliation
service, unconnected with the PIA, to have it resolved.
Ackner rejected specifically the suggestion that the PIA itself act as
conciliator. If it did, it would risk being viewed as a captive of the
industry. This is a suggestion which the new body wishes assiduously to
avoid.
The conciliator is intended to be a professional organisation, with skilled
individuals experienced in handling complaints and resolving them. But
before a complaint even lands there, the PIA will review the paperwork.
It is possible that the PIA will urge a company against which a complaint
has been laid to take a different approach. Or it might ask a complainant to
visit the PIA to discuss some detail which might have been misunderstood or
even overlooked entirely.
Once a case comes before the concilator, the judgment will consider not only
the contractual wording of the policy and the legal obligations on the
seller but also what is 'best practice.'
This means that a company which did not violate any rules technically, but
which broke the spirit of the rules in selling or maintaining a policy,
could be required to make reparations to a customer.
This issue was a sore point for some in the industry who had opposed it on
the ground that they were, effectively, providing investors with a free
service as an alternative to having to resort to the courts.
Why, they argued, should they pay for a service which offered the
possibility of a solution better than what might have been achieved in the
courts?
Ackner rejected such arguments, more or less on the ground that the industry
held the upper hand because of access to greater resources and expertise.
The new system is intended to redress that imbalance.
The conciliator will have the power to award restitution of up to Pounds
50,000, but those clients who are dissatisfied with any ruling will still
have leave to bring their case to the courts.
Investors should breathe a sigh of relief that some of the suggestions put
forward by parts of the industry have been rejected. Most potentially
damaging of these was the Life Insurance Association's proposal that any
complainant whose case did not stand up to scrutiny would be required to
bear the costs of bringing the complaint.
A rule like that would, in effect, have killed off all but complaints of the
most blatant instances of contract-breaching - hardly a reassuring
environment for investors.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Repossessions are falling but remain
high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT ITS MOST extreme, negative equity can lead to repossession. Previously,
an option for those falling far behind with their mortgage payments was to
sell the house, pay off the loan and rent. But the downturn in the housing
market has, for the time being, blocked off this option.
The main factor contributing to repossession has been losing a job because
of the recession. Relationship breakdowns and financial mismanagement are
the other reasons cited by the Council of Mortgage Lenders for home-owners
stopping payments and, in the most serious cases, being repossessed.
The number of houses taken back by lenders is dropping but remains high. The
CML said the figure for the first half of the year was 31,780, an 11 per
cent fall on the same period last year when the figure was 35,750. Total
repossessions last year were 68,540, down from the 1991 peak of 75,540.
Lenders have been following a policy of 'forbearance' by counselling those
who fall into arrears and, in the main, refraining from taking possession
unless payments dry up completely. Adrian Coles, director-general of the
CML, said the situation had been helped also by the reduction in interest
rates and the government's decision to pay income support for mortgage
interest directly to lenders.
Mike Smith, of the Northern Rock, said that repossession had been voluntary
in 50 per of his society's cases, with home-owners simply returning their
keys. The industry average was 35 per cent, said Coles.
The number of households with arrears of 12 months or more increased,
however, from 147,040 in the second half of 1992 to 158,000 in the first
half of this year. Altogether, just under 350,000 households have arrears of
six months or more.
Fears that 'forbearance' might cease once the housing market picks up, with
lenders repossessing properties to sell in a rising market, are denied
vehemently. 'There is a long, hard slog ahead in managing long-term
arrears,' said Coles. 'If people have a chance of recovering the situation,
lenders won't take possession.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: When your house is worth less than the
mortgage . . . - A look at the problem of negative equity and suggests some
ways to relieve the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEELING positive when you have negative equity is difficult although, for
most people, the thought that their mortgage might exceed the value of their
home turns into a problem only when they need to move.
Negative equity is largely a regional problem affecting areas where house
price inflation was at its highest in the mid to late 1980s. 'Nearly all the
problem is south of the Midlands,' says David Gilchrist, general manager of
corporate development at the Halifax building society, the largest lender.
The problem is also confined, for the most part, to first-time buyers.
According to the Woolwich building society, Britain's fourth-largest lender,
9 per cent of all British home-owners have negative equity and 70 per cent
of those live in the south of England. But 75 per cent are first-timers.
The Woolwich found that the number of home-owners with negative equity had
dropped from 1.8m in the year's first quarter to 1.45m in the second. This
was due to a 3.2 per cent rise in house prices (recorded by the Halifax)
between the first and second quarter. The Woolwich estimates the average
amount of negative equity per household to have dropped from Pounds 7,200 in
the first quarter to Pounds 6,600 in the second.
Sitting tight and waiting for house prices to rise is the easiest way out of
negative equity. But what of those who bought a one-bedroom or studio flat
and now have a family? Or others who have to move because of their job?
The costs of moving are substantial. Not only is there the negative equity
debt - the other outgoings include estate agents' fees, surveys, stamp duty
(on properties worth over Pounds 60,000), a deposit on the new home and, for
loans of more than 75 per cent of the property's value, a mortgage indemnity
premium. (This is a one-off insurance premium which protects the lender, not
you, against a mortgage default.)
The options for coping with these problems are limited but, broadly, they
are: beg, borrow or save.
Talking to your lender
Begging for help is perhaps an exaggerated way of describing the first step,
which is to talk to your bank or building society about the matter. Lenders
have adopted a policy of 'forbearance' to reduce the level of repossessions
(see below) and have extended this - although on a limited basis - to those
with negative equity.
You are most likely to get co-operation if your move also benefits the
lender. If you live in London but have a job offer in Birmingham, it is in
the interests of the lender to help you move to ensure that you will be able
to keep up payments. But lenders usually will help their negative equity
customers only if they have a strong payments record.
A few lenders have packaged schemes but most work on a case-by-case basis.
Although the Halifax has eschewed packages because it says each person's
circumstances differ, it is running a pilot study on such a plan although
warning that it cannot be promoted as a solution to negative equity
problems.
Transferring the negative equity
The Halifax prefers to deal with negative equity by letting the person move
and then transferring the shortfall on the old loan to the new property by
granting a mortgage of more than 100 per cent on the new one. The maximum it
will loan is 125 per cent of the value of the latter.
If your existing mortgage was Pounds 100,000 and the cost of the new
property also was Pounds 100,000, you would be able to buy it if your
negative equity was not more than Pounds 25,000. But your new total debt of
Pounds 125,000 must not exceed three times the level of your income. The
mortgage indemnity premium in this example would be Pounds 1,750.
The Halifax will not give additional help (although the mortgage indemnity
premium could be deducted from the loan) and expects people to have built up
savings for moving expenses.
The Royal Bank of Scotland follows a similar policy by granting loans up to
125 per cent on a new house, to a maximum Pounds 200,000. The new mortgage,
however, is granted at half a percentage point over the bank's standard
variable rate, now 7.99 per cent. Instead of a mortgage indemnity premium,
the RBS will charge an arrangement fee of 1 per cent of the loan, to a
maximum of Pounds 1,000.
Under the Woolwich's Mobility Mortgage, an effective trade-down would be
necessary because the price of the new property would have to match (or be
less than) the sale price of the existing home. The negative equity would be
added to the new loan, bringing the home-owner up to the same level of
borrowing as before.
Top-up loans
The Leeds and Nationwide societies will grant 100 per cent mortgages on the
new property with a top-up loan where necessary. The maximum limit on the
top-up loan is Pounds 25,000 at Nationwide, charged at 15 per cent APR if
the loan is unsecured and 12 per cent APR if it is secured on another
property. Under the Leeds' scheme, the total debt cannot exceed 125 per cent
of the purchase price of the new property, and the 25 per cent loan would be
charged at the society's standard variable rate.
Substituting equity
The Leeds, Woolwich, Nationwide and Yorkshire societies will allow borrowers
to use their parents' home (or that of anyone else willing to sign the
documents) as security for a larger loan. The details of the schemes differ
but the cheapest way is for two mortgages to be taken out, one on your new
home and one on that of your parents. You could avoid paying the mortgage
indemnity premium by borrowing up to 75 per cent of the value of new home,
with the parental mortgage making up the shortfall.
100 per cent mortgage
Those with enough savings to pay off their negative equity, and who can
afford moving expenses but not the deposit on a new home, can consider a 100
per cent mortgage. This market was virtually dead until recently, but some
lenders have ventured in again. Take care to get a quotation for the full
final cost of the mortgage (including arrangement and other fees) before
taking it out.
The Abbey National will consider 100 per cent mortgages for its own
customers while mortgage-broker John Charcol and the Household Mortgage
Corporation will consider applicants meeting their criteria as long as they
are second-time buyers. The Royal Bank of Scotland will also grant 100 per
cent mortgages, but only to first-time buyers.
The 100 per cent loan can be taken out in various forms at John Charcol. You
can get the full 100 per cent or, to avoid the indemnity premium, a 75 per
cent mortgage with a loan covering the other 25 per cent (although the
interest on this proportion would be at a higher variable rate of 10.5 per
cent). Fixed rates are available for the mortgage portion.
The HMC also offers fixed and variable rates (its standard variable rate is
7.69 per cent). Indemnity premiums are on the high side; for a loan of
Pounds 100,000, the charge would be Pounds 2,500. This can be added to the
mortgage if that is up to 95 per cent of the value of the home, but will be
subtracted otherwise.

THE Matrix Stock Market business expansion scheme, sponsored by Matrix
Securities and aimed at providing student accommodation for Nottingham
University, has a minimum exit price after five years of 75p for every 100p
invested with a variable amount linked to the FT-SE 100 index. The scheme
has an automatic lock-in at 60 per cent growth in the Footsie and again at
90 per cent.
Accumulus King's is an arranged exit cash-backed scheme offering 120p after
five years per every 100p invested, equating to a 13.9 per cent annual
return for a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.4 per cent for a lower rate
taxpayer. The BES, sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital, will buy property from
King's College, Cambridge to be let as assured tenancies.
Queen Mary and Westfield College Residences, sponsored by Downing Corporate
Finance, has an arranged exit price of 127p per every 100p invested but has
cash backing for only 25 per cent of the buyback obligation, according to
BESt Investment. The minimum investment for all the schemes is Pounds 2,000.

Witan Investment Company, the investment trust managed by Henderson Touche
Remnant, found an ingenious way of reducing the 'in-house' bias of its
investment policy this week. It raised a Pounds 56.25m bond, convertible
into the shares of three other Henderson trusts (Electric and General,
Greenfriar and Lowland). It also sold an 8.2 per cent stake in Henderson
itself. Previously in-house investments formed more than Pounds 100m of
Witan's Pounds 880m portfolio. According to Micropal, the trust was 12th

1 and 11th out of 19 over 10 years.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: That's the way the money goes - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S ONLY money. Half the governments of Europe spent the week hurling vast
sums at their collapsing currencies. Merck, the US drug giant, spent Dollars
6bn buying a company which puts prescriptions in the mail. Reuters decided
to hand Pounds 350m back to its shareholders, on the grounds that if it kept
the cash it might do something silly with it. All in all, one sees Reuters'
point.
Undeniably, cash is not what it was. Not in the UK, at any rate. Bill Smith,
head of research at BZW, observes that the return you get on cash these days
is the lowest for a generation. It is also lower than the return on gilts,
equities or property. This helps to explain why unit trust sales in this
year's second quarter were the second highest on record.
Professional investors tend to get slightly twitchy at this point, rather as
they do when taxi-drivers start buying gold. If the private punter reckons
that the market can only go up, it is usually time to sell. It scarcely
helps that the highest quarter on record for unit trust sales was the third
quarter of 1987, just before the worst market crash in two decades. But this
time, the private punter surely has a point. Though the savings ratio is a
little below its peak of six months ago, people are still squirrelling money
away; and with equities still yielding almost 4 per cent, there is simply no
incentive to leave it in the bank.
The other thing helping the market this week was, of course, the spectacle
across the Channel of what looked increasingly like the ERM's death-throes.
At the time of writing, the French authorities were still grappling
desperately with the speculators and affirming their commitment to the
system. But then they would, wouldn't they. As one market cynic put it
yesterday, to make sense of what is happening you need only take what the UK
government was saying last autumn and translate it into French.
From the UK market's point of view, the beauty of it all is that the
collapse of the ERM would help UK corporate profits whatever the UK
government did in response. The immediate result would be a fall in
Continental interest rates, Germany presumably excepted. That would
stimulate the Continental economies, thereby improving the prospects for UK
exporters. This is something of a live topic: according to the CBI this
week, exports to the Continent are proving so sticky that the whole UK
recovery is at risk. Of course, if Clarke followed the CBI's other piece of
advice and cut UK rates, so much the better. From the market's point of
view, there is only one possible way the government could get it wrong: if
an ERM collapse sent sterling through the roof and Clarke still refused to
cut rates, in spite of the damage to exports. But he wouldn't be so silly.
Would he?
Let us assume that the market is right, and that UK rates are due for
another fall. That makes even more sense of Reuters' decision this week to
give Pounds 350m back to shareholders. In fact, the money is to be used in
buying back Reuters' own shares, rather than simply handed out as a one-off
dividend payment. But as Reuters explained, that was simply a means of
giving shareholders with a high tax rate the option of leaving their money
where it is.
Implicitly, though, Reuters is saying that with interest rates where they
are, spare cash is better returned to the owners than left to burn a hole in
managers' pockets. Besides, the likely return through investing that cash in
the business is likely to be lower in the stingy 1990s than it was in the
free-wheeling 1980s. Other companies are in the same dilemma: in particular,
drug groups like Glaxo and Wellcome, which have steep cash mountains and and
a steadily worsening commercial outlook.
As it happened, their response to that outlook was also on display this
week. Glaxo and Wellcome formed a grand triple alliance with the US drugs
and consumer group Warner-Lambert, whereby they hand over to Warner-Lambert
the job of selling any of their drugs which are converted from prescription
medicines to consumer products. This is specifically in response to the
efforts of Hillary Clinton and her counterparts around the globe to control
their drug bills. When Glaxo's Zantac, the world's biggest-selling drug, is
prescribed for ulcers, it is mostly paid for by governments. Come the day
that it is sold as a patent medicine for indigestion and hangovers, it will
be paid for by the sufferers themselves.
But the troubles of the drug industry are perhaps too grievous a topic to
dwell on, as is the plight of those who bought Glaxo shares at the top of
the market. Better to turn to a bit of light relief, from the somewhat
surprising source of corporate Germany. This is the setting for quite the
most diverting boardroom shocker to have surfaced in years: Volkswagen
versus General Motors, or The Case of the Exiting Basque. This hinges, for
those who missed earlier episodes, on the behaviour of the exotically named
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, an ex-GM top man who has seriously annoyed
Detroit by defecting to Volkswagen and - GM says - taking secret documents
with him.
The row over this has been bad-tempered from the outset. For connoisseurs of
the Higher Childishness, however, this week's exchanges had classic status.
Volkswagen's boss, Ferdinand Piech, said GM had planted its secrets on VW as
a means of getting at Lopez. The whole thing, he implied, was a dirty
American plot to do down German industry. Opel, GM's German subsidiary,
rejoined that Piech was not one to talk. As an Austrian, he does not even
have a German passport. So there.
Almost unnoticed in the hubbub, GM announced on Thursday that it had swung
from loss into profit in the second quarter, and its shares went up. But
that, as the obsessed combatants would doubtless say, was only money as
well.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: Optimists read between the lines - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS THIS week got their clearest look yet at the state of the economy
and corporate earnings, and seemed to like what they saw - which was
surprising, because some of the numbers, at least superficially, were not
encouraging.
The economic news consisted of the second quarter gross domestic product
report, while the earnings results were released by a variety of large
industrial companies, including International Business Machines, Ford,
General Motors, RJR Nabisco, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Du Pont,
Allied Signal and Walt Disney.
The raft of data, of course, was entirely historical, covering a period
between April and June. Generally, share prices are driven by expectations,
so in some respects this week's figures were not especially helpful. Yet, a
close eye is always kept on earnings and economic releases because they tell
investors whether their past predictions (predictions that are priced into
stocks) have been accurate.
Judging by their reactions this week - when the Dow set a new high and the
important indices held steady or posted gains over the five days - investors
believed that the data broadly met their expectations. That can certainly be
said for the quarterly reporting season, which has passed so far with few
surprises.
The same, however, cannot be said for recent economic news, particularly
Thursday's gross domestic product report. The government estimates that GDP
grew by 1.6 per cent in the latest quarter. It was an improvement on the
first quarter growth rate of 0.7 per cent, but it remained disappointingly
short of forecasts.
The weak growth surprised everyone, including those who really should know
what is going on, such as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Last
week, he confidently told Congress that the economy would grow by about 2.5
per cent in the second quarter. Wall Street economists were looking for a
slightly slower rate of growth - around 2.2 per cent.
It was the second quarter in succession in which growth was well below
forecasts. Yet over the last six months stocks have not paid the price of
these unfulfilled expectations. Just the opposite, equities have kept edging
higher. In normal times, bad news should force investors to drive prices
lower until they reflected the new reality of market fundamentals.
There are various explanations for this seemingly irrational behaviour.
First, investors and most of the professionals on Wall Street are incurable
optimists. If they were not, they would not be in the market - pessimists do
not buy stocks, they buy bonds.
Second, the economy may be struggling, but corporate earnings are improving,
thanks to the measures taken by companies at the tail end of the last
recession to cut costs, boost efficiency and improve profitability. Although
some companies are coming to this process rather late - IBM's managers
announced plans for thousands more redundancies and more plant closures this
week - most have the bulk of the restructuring out of the way, and many are
now reaping the rewards of their actions.
Third, even if the fundamentals are not great, there is enough money flowing
into equities to keep prices afloat even in all but the most difficult of
times. So long as interest rates remain low - and the current sluggish state
of the economy should ensure they remain low for a while yet - investors
will keep switching their funds out of low-yielding short-term assets into
stocks.
Finally, economic figures such as the GDP data are rarely what they seem at
first glance. Take this latest release, for example. The disappointingly
weak headline number masked some positive news, such as 3.8 per cent
increase in consumer spending and the low implicit price deflator (a key
inflation barometer). Even more encouraging was the role of inventories in
the data.
The discrepancy between strong consumer spending and weak output was
explained by inventories. They had grown so much in the first quarter, that
during the second quarter manufacturers were able to keep up with the
increase in consumer demand by running down their stockpiles of goods,
rather than stepping up production. If inventories are excluded from the GDP
numbers, growth in the second quarter would have been a handy 3.7 per cent.
It is this kind of thinking that is keeping stocks at their current high
levels. If the underlying improvement in the economy is eventually reflected
in the headline figures (and, crucially, the jobs numbers), and if companies
can sustain the upward momentum in earnings, then the stock markets have a
chance of not just breaking new ground, but building on it in the second
half of this year.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: A somewhat sickly sector - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST way to make the chief executive of a drugs company laugh is to tell
him his industry is immune from recession. Only 18 months ago he would have
politely agreed.
Recessionary clouds have gathered over the drugs sector quickly. Analysts'
attention has been concentrated on the US, the world's largest single
market. American healthcare cost Dollars 768bn last year  - equivalent to 14
per cent of GNP. The Clinton administration can no longer afford its portion
of the bill. It is preparing reforms and the profitable pharmaceuticals
industry is sitting in the cross-hair of its sights. The trigger is expected
to pulled in September when the programme is announced.
At the same time, the US customer-base for medicines is changing rapidly.
Large bulk-buyers of health are taking an ever-greater share of the market -
up from 22 per cent of the non-hospital drugs market in 1987 to 35 per cent
last year. Worse still, they are negotiating ever-greater discounts - up
from 10 per cent in 1987 to 25 per cent in 1992, according to analysts at
Lehman Brothers.
The US drugs market, long-used to double-digit growth, expanded at only 3
per cent during the first five months. The reaction of the financial markets
has been brutal. Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company, has
dropped 40 per cent since January 1992. Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group,
has fallen by a similar amount.
But while eyes have been watching the clouds on the western side of the
Atlantic, they may have missed the storms brewing in Europe. Some US drugs
analysts have viewed Europe as a side-show. But Europe is a bigger market
than America. IMS International, the market research group, estimates drugs
sales in European pharmacies during the first five months this year were
Dollars 19bn, compared with Dollars 18bn in the US.
Europe, too, is being swept by healthcare reform. The reforms, though less
dramatic, are nevertheless insidiously undermining results of both US and
European groups.
The reforms have hit hardest in Germany, the world's third biggest
single-country market after the US and Japan last year. IMS International
estimates that during the first six months of 1992 the market was growing at
about 10 per cent (Eastern Germany at 16 per cent and Western Germany at 9
per cent). During the first five months this year, it has collapsed 11 per
cent.
Zeneca, ICI's former bioscience subsidiary, estimates its German sales for
the first six months were down 18 per cent, while SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American healthcare group, believes its sales were down 9 per cent.
Meanwhile, Italian reforms are also having an impact. IMS estimates the
market grew 10 per cent during the first six months last year. This year,
during the first five months, it fell 1.8 per cent.
As a result, the European market, expanding at 10 per cent during the six
months to June in 1992, registered growth of only 0.9 per cent during the
first five months this year.
Worse is to come. Jan Leschly, SmithKline Beecham's head of pharmaceuticals
and group chief executive designate, said: 'I'm not optimistic about Germany
and Italy for the full year. And there's no doubt that in France, the UK and
Spain we will see cost-containment measures introduced in the near future.'
Given the poor outlook in the US and Europe, it may be too early to call the
turn for drugs sector. Some companies are riding out the storm. Those armed
with new, innovative products capable of generating volume growth, are
prospering.
Take Roche of Switzerland, whose shares have risen from SFr3,001 in
September 1990 to a peak of SFr8,650 this month. Astra, the Swedish company,
has also held on well in spite of being hit by the German reforms. Its
shares have risen from a low of SKr26 in 1989 to SKr142 this week.
The lesson is that although pharmaceuticals stocks used to be difficult to
differentiate, they must now be picked with care. That may bring a smile
back to the faces of some - but not all - pharmaceutical company chief
executives.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: The seductive view from the top - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE investors have an unfortunate tendency to buy shares at the top of
the market. So news that unit trust sales are close to levels last attained
during the third quarter of 1987 (just before the Crash) makes the cynical
observer rather uneasy.
A survey from Save &amp; Prosper illustrates the problem. S &amp; P found that in
June 1991, when the FT-SE 100 index was around 2,500, only 28 per cent of
private investors surveyed thought that it was a good time to invest in
stocks and shares. In June 1992, with Footsie at 2,700, the figure was 25
per cent. The same survey conducted this year, when the index was around
2,850, found that 54 per cent of investors believed it was a good time to
buy stocks and shares.
You could argue that investors in June 1992 were fairly shrewd, in that the
market fell sharply over the summer reaching its nadir, of around 2,280,
just before sterling's devaluation. On the other hand, I wonder whether
private investors would have felt confident about the prospects for shares
on Black Wednesday, since when the market has rallied substantially.
Of course, it is inevitable that when share prices are low, investors will
be depressed - their depression is what makes prices low in the first place.
And the flood of demand which occurs when private investors enter the share
market in numbers helps indices to reach new peaks - look at the US, where
interest rates of 3 per cent or so have caused individuals to swap deposits
for shares.
Nevertheless, the shrewd investor will try to avoid the herd mentality. Just
as, when UK interest rates were 15 per cent, it was tempting, but wrong, to
hold all your money in cash and forget equities, it would now be foolish to
have all your money in shares at a time, when the market, in terms of
price-earnings ratios and dividend yields, looks expensive in historical
terms. A balance of cash, gilts and shares is the answer.
*****
Foreign &amp; Colonial's latest investment trust is an unusual animal. For a
start, it is the first split capital trust launched by F &amp; C, which has
traditionally been associated with the 'keep it simple' school of trust
management. Secondly, although the trust is investing in utilities, it is
concentrating on a particularly recondite part of the sector - the former
statutory water companies.
These groups are not the same as the privatised water companies such as
Severn Trent. The 'statutory companies' are responsible purely for water
supply, not for sewage; many date back to the 19th century, and they were so
named because, until recently, their profits and dividends were set by
statute.
For many years they were a neglected corner of the stock market until the
French water companies started to buy stakes in the late 1980s. Share prices
shot ahead, and did so again when statutory controls were lifted - according
to F &amp; C, the dividend of the Chester company, set at 3p for many years, is
now 225p per share.
One particular private investor, the Australian-based Duncan Saville, was
clever enough to profit from all this and became one of the largest holders
of water supply stocks. He approached F &amp; C with the idea of swapping his
holdings into investment trust shares - and the idea for the trust was born.
Its name will be the Special Utilities Investment Trust, or SUIT for short.
Depending on how much the trust raises, between 44 and 80 per cent of the
portfolio will be in water supply stocks. The remainder will be in other
utilities such as electricity, gas or telecommunications.
F &amp; C argues that the water supply companies are attractive investments.
They supply water to nearly a quarter of the population, have lower capital
expenditure plans, high cash generation and a good relationship with the
regulator.
The income shares will be entitled to all the fund's income and the first
60p of assets, when the trust is wound up in 10 years' time. They will be
offered at 60p each and will have an initial dividend yield of 7.75 per
cent. If dividends grow at 5 per cent per year, the expected gross
redemption yield will be 9.4 per cent.
The capital shares, sold at 40p each, will get no income but will get all
the assets of the trust after the income shares have been repaid. If the
assets grow at 5 per cent per year, the expected gross redemption yield will
be 8.5 per cent. However, it is worth noting that if the trust's assets do
not grow at all, investors will lose money. Saville will be taking capital
shares for his holding.
There will also be package units (at 100p) which can be converted into one
income and one capital share at any time. The initial yield will be 4.7 per
cent, and the minimum investment for package investors is Pounds 500. All
the various shares are Pepable.
Potential investors should realise this is a highly specialised trust, the
investments of which will be concentrated in a politically sensitive and
(perverse though it sounds) illiquid sector. It is certainly not a fund for
the first time investor, who would get a much better spread from F &amp; C's
flagship investment trust. But larger investors might find the income shares
attractive as part of a wider income-seeking portfolio.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The Long View: Not so well-endowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY ON earth would you sign a savings contract at the same time you are
borrowing money? It sounds like a contradiction in terms; yet, about 70 per
cent of British homebuyers do this when they take out a mortgage. In most
cases, they combine the loan with an endowment policy, a long-term savings
contract provided by life companies.
These endowment mortgages have been threatened several times already in the
past 10 years, for instance by the withdrawal of tax relief on life premiums
in 1984 and, more recently, by cuts in bonuses on endowment contracts. Now,
they face their biggest and perhaps toughest challenge: the Treasury has
decreed that banks and building societies must make a 'hard' disclosure to
customers of the cash commissions they earn on these plans.
Once, endowment mortgages made very good sense for those able to pay a
little bit more each month. Maturing 25-year with-profits plans have proved
extremely profitable, earning about 12.5 per cent a year compared with
average inflation of 9 per cent. But the attraction has been eroded
seriously. The endowment mortgage today reflects mainly a marketing, rather
than an investment, opportunity: when Mr Prospect ventures into a mortgage
office, he is uniquely open to sales patter based on the premise that an
endowment mortgage is 'normal' and he should have one, too.
What is the theory behind the endowment mortgage? It is all a matter of a
comparison with a repayment mortgage, which is designed to repay the loan
through level monthly instalments. At the beginning, the instalments consist
almost entirely of interest, with only small amounts repaid; by the end of
the term, the reverse is true.
Under this structure, the monthly amounts channelled into repaying the
principal are, effectively, earning interest at the mortgage rate. But
suppose, instead, that they were invested separately at a higher rate; you
would be better off than before. And if the margin were good enough, you
could accumulate enough over, say, 25 years to repay the original loan in
one lump at maturity, perhaps leaving a surplus.
In the 1960s, these sums worked out extremely well. The mortgage rate was
held artificially low by building societycartel arrangements (at about 7 per
cent) and there was unlimited income tax relief on interest, with a standard
rate of 30 per cent and higher rates of anything up to 75 per cent. On the
savings side, life premiums received a subsidy of half the standard rate of
income tax. The money could be invested prudently in gilts or company loan
stocks earning 2 or 3 percentage points over the typical mortgage rate.
By the 1970s, inflation was posing a threat to real returns on the savings
side although this was more than offset by the negative real cost of
mortgage interest (which in 1975 was about minus 20 per cent). There was a
gap of up to 8 percentage points between the long gilt yield and the
net-of-tax mortgage rate. Endowment mortgage plans began to accumulate big
profits.
Then came Thatcherism, and deregulation. In the 1980s, the mortgage rate
shot up and gilt yields fell. The impact of the Pounds 25,000 loan limit for
mortgage interest tax relief, imposed in 1974 and increased to only Pounds
30,000 in 1983, began to become more serious as house prices surged upwards
(today's average new mortgage is nearly Pounds 50,000). Life companies
shifted their investment strategy and turned to equities to provide the high
returns essential to pay the required bonuses. Riskier assumptions were
made. Endowment mortgages thereby ceased to represent a sensible
exploitation of a reasonably predictable interest differential and, instead,
became a stock market speculation.
For several years, the gamble paid off. But a warning of how it could all go
wrong came with the notorious home income schemes, which were back-to-front
endowment mortgages sold in the 1980s. Pensioners would take out loans
secured on their houses and put part of the proceeds into investment bonds,
which would repay the interest and debt out of stock dividends and capital
gains. But loan rates soared and the stock market crashed in 1987. Thousands
of pensioners now dread eviction.
The consequences for endowment mortgagees will not be quite so dire: the
worst likely to happen is that they will be asked to raise the monthly
payments into their endowments. The increases might be substantial in
relation to the endowment premiums alone but, compared with the total
outgoings including interest, they should only be modest. All the same, it
is highly unsatisfactory that buyers have paid large commissions for being
put into contracts which may prove of doubtful value.
Meanwhile, the arithmetic of endowment mortgages continues to get worse.
From next April, the maximum monthly tax relief on mortgage interest will
shrivel to about Pounds 40 a borrower (relief at 20 per cent on a Pounds
30,000 loan). The gap between the mortgage rate and the long gilt yield is
just about nil, and stock market returns have become more uncertain.
Another way of looking at the whole question is to take account of the role
of inflation in eroding mortgage debt. If you took out a 25-year, Pounds
20,000 loan in 1968 - a very large sum in those days - it will now seem very
small at maturity because it is the equivalent of only Pounds 2,340 in 1968
money. It has been easy to accumulate that modest real sum in a parallel
savings plan. But if future inflation is only 2 or 3 per cent, instead of 9
per cent, your savings will have to work much harder.
Hard commission disclosure will provide a good opportunity for banks and
building societies to look again at the viability of endowment mortgages.
But it would be more encouraging if the interests of the customers, rather
than regulatory embarrassment, were to trigger the re-think.
Another blow for endowments? - Page IV

FT  31 JUL 93 / A journey along Europe's fault line: Edward Mortimer
travelled through the linguistic borderlands between Romance and Teutonic
and found the scars of history everywhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA first came to me 10 years ago, on the way back from a holiday in
Italy. We found ourselves driving through a series of countries or regions -
Switzerland, Alsace, Luxembourg, Belgium - where Romance languages (mainly
French) overlap with Teutonic ones (German and Dutch). It occurred to me
that this was the great historic and cultural divide in western Europe.
On one side of us were lands where the Roman empire had put down such deep
roots that, 1,500 years after its disappearance, people still spoke
languages derived from Latin. On the other were the linguistic descendants
of those 'barbarian' tribes which were never fully Romanised, but stuck to
their Germanic speech.
I remembered my old headmaster, Robert Birley, telling us about the Treaty
of Verdun in 843AD, when Charlemagne's empire was divided between his three
grandsons. Charles the Bald got the west, which became France; Louis 'the
German' got the lands east of the Rhine; and the eldest, Lothair, got a
long, thin middle kingdom stretching from Friesland to the border of
Calabria. 'And you know,' Birley would say, swinging his spectacles with
excitement, 'the whole of subsequent European history can be seen as a
struggle between the heirs of Charles and Louis to control the kingdom of
Lothair.'
The kingdom of Lothair: the great battleground of western Europe, but also
its richest, most productive region - today's 'golden banana.' The clash of
cultures, I thought, had been both destructive and creative on a dazzling
scale. The land was soaked in blood, but from it sprang cathedrals, cloth
halls, colleges, chateaux.
There is, after all, something stimulating about cultural hybridity -
perhaps something quintessentially European. Certainly this is the region
where 'Europe' has aroused the greatest enthusiasm: it offers peaceful
exchange instead of violent conflict, and makes dilemmas about national
identity less agonising, because less absolute.
I formed a plan to explore the region a little more systematically: to
attempt a journey along the fault line, observing in greater detail both its
historical residue (buildings, statues, inscriptions) and the way it is
experienced by those who live on it today. This summer a sabbatical leave
from the FT gave me the chance to do it.
Leaving England on May 28, I started at Dunkirk (an old Flemish port, now
the northernmost city in France) and for the next five weeks worked my way
south and east along the language border, travelling a short distance each
day, usually by bus or train, sometimes on foot, staying in pensions or
cheap hotels, or quite often - unashamed of my grey hair - in youth hostels.
(There is in fact no age limit, other than one's own tolerance for dormitory
life).
My proudest moment came when I strode into an Alsatian village, weighed down
by my rucksack, and made friends with a resident who turned out to be the
German writer and comedian, Philipp Sontag. I asked if there was a path
through the forest to the next village, and he consulted his neighbour,
introducing me with the words 'hier ist ein englischer Wanderer.'
I did not quite fulfil my ambition of carrying on 'until I meet my first
Slav.' Time ran out on me in South Tyrol/Alto Adige, the predominantly
German-speaking province of northern Italy. But I did reach Innichen/San
Candido, founded as a Benedictine monastery in the 8th century 'to
Christianise the Slavs.' Evidently they were there then, even if later they
were pushed east.
From the summit of Mount Helm (Monte Elmo), I had a fine view of the river
Drava flowing down through Austria towards Slovenia, Croatia and the Danube;
and also of the Italian-Austrian frontier, running eastward along the top of
the Carnic Alps. From there on, it coincides with the language border.
As the crow flies, the distance from Dunkirk to Innichen is 540 miles. The
language border, anything but crow-like, is probably double that. Yet in
remarkably few places between those two points does it coincide with a
national frontier. Perhaps the only stretch where it incontrovertibly does
so is between the Matterhorn and the Corno Gries, where the high Alps form a
natural barrier between Italy and a purely German-speaking part of
Switzerland. To the west French is spoken on both sides of the frontier, and
to the east Italian.
The other obvious exception was the short stretch right at the beginning of
my route, between Dunkirk and Lille. Here France marches directly with
Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. But even that statement has
at once to be qualified, because the land on the French side of the frontier
is also Flanders. True, you do not hear the Flemish dialect spoken there
much these days, but almost any middle-aged native will tell you that his
parents spoke it, even if he himself no longer does.
In other words, when the frontier was drawn people spoke the same language
on both sides, but over time the French language has imposed itself on the
French side. Three hundred miles further on, in Alsace, I observed the same
process at work, but at an earlier stage. There you cannot help hearing
German spoken - or rather the Alsatian dialect, 'related to German,' as some
Alsatians will tell you.
But the people speaking it are almost invariably over 50. Their children
understand it, and may reply in kind if spoken to in it, but feel more
natural speaking French among themselves. Which means, of course, that the
grandchildren are usually not learning it at all.
Thus the French state, with its firm insistence on a single national
language and culture, is gradually pushing the language border north and
east. In another generation it should fully coincide with the state
frontier. If the process has further to go in Alsace than in French Flanders
it is because for nearly half a century, between 1870 and 1918, Alsace and
northern Lorraine were incorporated into Germany, and their inhabitants
firmly taught to think of themselves as German.
That experience was briefly but much more brutally repeated in 1940-44.
Ironically enough, this second dose of Germanisation, under Nazi rule, may
have sealed the fate of Alsace's German cultural identity. The Alsatians
emerged from it doubly traumatised. In many ways being part of the Third
Reich was worse than being merely occupied: Alsatians were liable, for
instance, to conscription into the Reichswehr, sometimes even into SS units.
But once liberated and reunited with France they found themselves tainted
with guilt by association, when not accused of direct complicity in Nazi
crimes. Nothing could have been more politically incorrect, in post-war
France, than to declare oneself German. Hence the insistence that the
Alsatian dialect is not actually German, only related to it. And hence the
indignation which drove the father of a friend of mine - a retired village
baker - to protest formally to his MP when a well-known French actress
opined recently, on television, that the Alsatians were 'really German.'
The contrast with South Tyrol is striking. There too a historically
German-speaking region finds itself, as a result of the first world war,
within the borders of a non-German nation state. There too the spoken
language is a dialect, if anything less easily understood than Alsatian by a
visitor from Germany.
But no one in South Tyrol tries to tell you it is a separate language
'related to German.' On the contrary, the majority unhesitatingly identify
themselves as German-speakers and exercise their right to have their
children educated in that language. They have to learn Italian as their
first foreign language, but this is reciprocated by the Italian-speaking
minority, who are obliged to learn German.
Every street and place name is written up in both languages, and it is
actually the German-speakers who are now contesting this, on the grounds
that many of the Italian names are 'artificial,' invented under Mussolini.
The administration is bilingual, with fixed quotas of jobs at various levels
for the different language communities. The province enjoys broad autonomy,
and the German-speaking Sudtiroler Volkspartei is permanently in power.
There is even an open, if not too serious, nostalgia cult for the days of
Austrian rule: in a bookshop in Meran (Merano) I was able to buy a 1993
Franz Joseph calendar, inscribed 'Dem guten alten Kaiser zur Erinnerung.'
(In rememberance of the good old Kaiser.)
Why are such things possible in Italy, but not in France? Because Italy was
on the losing side in the second world war, and because the German identity
of South Tyrol is associated with Austria rather than with Germany. Whereas
in Alsace the moral burden of association with fascism fell entirely on
Germany, obliging the local population to suppress their German identity and
proclaim their Frenchness, in South Tyrol it fell, if anything, more heavily
on Italy.
The Italian elite were anxious to dissociate themselves from Mussolini's
policies, including his attempt to Italianise the South Tyrol by forced
assimilation and colonisation. The local Germans, on the other hand, were
largely spared any association with Hitler. It was only in 1943, after Italy
switched sides, that Hitler annexed South Tyrol.
Before that, in 1939, he had agreed with Mussolini that each South Tyrol
family should be given the choice (die Option) between emigration and
complete Italianisation: an episode still remembered with great bitterness.
After the war Austria, as an independent 'liberated' state, was able to
negotiate an agreement under which Italy allowed those who had emigrated to
return, and promised regional autonomy. Although this agreement was not
fully implemented until 1972 (after a period of low-level terrorism in the
1960s) it put the problem in a legal and psychological context different
from that of Alsace.
One noticeable thing about my route was that it lay not only well inside the
limes of the Roman empire, which ran along the Rhine and the Danube, but
also outside the Staatsgrenze of present-day Germany. In fact I did make two
day-trips into the federal republic, but they were rather in the nature of
pilgrimages: to Aachen, where Charlemagne is buried, and to Trier, which was
the capital of Roman Gaul. Both are today, and have been for many centuries,
purely German cities. The fact that the linguistic frontier is located south
and west of them testifies to the thorough Germanisation, in the Dark Ages,
of what had been Roman frontier provinces.
That today's political frontier passes so close to them testifies to the
politico-military success of France, and failure of Germany, in modern
history. The French state expanded north and east into German-speaking
territory during the 16th and 17th centuries, when Germany was divided and
weakened by the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War. The creation of a
strong German state in the late 19th century came too late to reverse this
process, although its attempt to do so was defeated only with terrible
bloodshed, in three successive Franco-German wars.
But while the French state absorbed significant numbers of German-speakers,
it never incorporated all the French-speakers in Europe, except for a brief
period after the French revolution. Such an aim would have meant little to
Henri II, who occupied Metz in 1552, or even to Louis XIV, who gave France
more or less its present frontiers. To them land might be of strategic or
economic interest, but the language spoken by its inhabitants among
themselves was of little consequence. Educated people could be relied on to
communicate in a language of high culture - Latin, or later French -
whatever their mother tongue might be.
In the Thomaskirche in Strasbourg is a magnificent sculpture by Pigalle: the
mausoleum of the Marechal de Saxe. It shows France in tears, trying to hold
back the marshal from his tomb. Her banners fly victoriously aloft, while
her foes - lion of Holland, leopard of England, eagle of Austria - are
hurled downwards in defeat. Saxe was the main French general in the war of
the Austrian succession, in the 1740s.
Oddly enough in Brussels, in the Musee Communal, there is a print
celebrating France's defeat and Austria's victory in that same war. It shows
Charles de Lorraine, the Austrian governor, entering the city, and declares
that
'Ce pais desole sous le joug de la France,
jouit d'un doux repos apres sa delivrance.'
(This country laid waste under the yoke of France enjoys a sweet repose
after its deliverance.)
For both sides to claim victory is not unusual. What interested me was the
linguistic cross-over: Saxe, a German princeling, devoted his life to
winning land and glory for the king of France, while the Belgian poetaster
found it equally natural to denounce the 'yoke of France' in French
couplets.
Fifty years later things had changed. The French 'nation' sprang into
existence, got rid of its king, and set off on a crusade to liberate the
rest of Europe. But while more distant and indubitably foreign countries
were turned, first into sister republics, then into satellite kingdoms,
France itself also expanded, especially into areas where French was spoken.
Brussels found itself in the 'departement de la Dyle,' Namur in the
'departement de Sambre-et-Meuse'; the Swiss Jura became the 'departement du
Mont-Terrible,' and Luxembourg, rather charmingly, the 'departement des
Forets.'
But France had to retreat after Napoleon's defeat. In the half-century that
followed, the three buffer states of Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland
emerged in their modern form. In all three both French and German are
spoken, alongside other languages, but the form of coexistence is different
in each case.
Luxembourg is the odd one out, the smallest and perhaps also the happiest.
It has its own national language, which is related to German and which
everybody speaks. But nearly everybody speaks French and German as well.
French tends to be used for official purposes, German for more informal
ones. There seems to be no sense of compulsion about it, and no one takes
offence at being addressed in one language rather than another.
Things are different, alas, in Belgium, which has just changed from a
unitary state into a federation based on regions and linguistic communities.
Flanders is Dutch-speaking, Wallonia French-speaking, and you know at once
which you are in because notices and road-signs are strictly unilingual.
Thus Liege, for example, is in Wallonia, but signposts to it in Flanders
call it only by its Dutch name, Luik.
Brussels, the federal capital, is for the time being still bilingual. The
small German-speaking community, in eastern Wallonia, does not have a region
as such but does have its own schools and cultural institutions. In its area
the signposts are bilingual (French and German), but the French names of
German-speaking towns and villages have usually been scratched out.
Otherwise the German-speakers seem happy with their lot, and have no desire
to join Germany. 'We are the only real Belgians,' one of them told me. 'If
Belgium breaks up, we'll probably ask to join Luxembourg.'
Certainly Belgium as such seems to inspire little affection in either of the
other communities. The French-speaking Walloons now feel that it is run by
the Flemish majority, while the Dutch-speaking Flemings still resent the way
they were ignored and patronised by the French in the past.
In Brussels I saw a Flemish film, Daens, which explains this attitude very
effectively. It is about a Flemish priest who stood up for exploited textile
workers at the end of the last century, and founded the Social Christian
Party which dominates Flemish politics. In the film all the educated and
upper- class people speak French to each other, from King Leopold II to the
Flemish employers and bishops, while the workers speak only Dutch. A
parliamentary commission is sent to look into working conditions in the town
of Aalst, where the film is set, but fails to discover the flagrant abuse of
child labour because its members cannot understand what the workers are
saying, and rely on the wicked foreman as interpreter.
Things are not that bad in Switzerland, but some French-speaking Swiss
intellectuals have almost as big a chip on their shoulder. Their feelings
were aroused especially by last year's referendum on the European Economic
Area, in which the French-speaking areas all voted overwhelmingly Yes but
the national result was still No. In fact, the German-speaking majority was
itself deeply divided on the issue, with urban voters generally in favour,
but many French-speakers began to feel they were prisoners in a kind of
folksy Teutonic museum.
At least, that was the rhetoric. Behind it lay a host of local issues, with
education, as always, being the most sensitive but signposts and
street-names sometimes the most symbolic. French-speakers believe (though
official statistics say the opposite) that German is gaining ground at the
expense of French, and many of them have latched on to what is awkwardly
known as 'the principle of territoriality' in an attempt to stop it.
This means that the local majority has the right to determine the language
that can be used in courts, schools and official notices. Such is already
the practice in many parts of Switzerland, and there is now a proposal to
have it enshrined in the constitution.
That looks uncomfortably like a 'Belgification' of Switzerland. Not
surprisingly, some Swiss legislators are having second thoughts. Fulvio
Caccia, an MP from the Italian-speaking Ticino, worries about the loss of
individual freedom implied in the territoriality principle, and fears that
it 'contains within it the germs of linguistic cleansing.'
The echo of 'ethnic cleansing' in former Yugoslavia is, of course,
deliberate. By that standard Switzerland and even Belgium have done well,
since they have largely avoided violence in working out their differences.
Whatever happens to Maastricht and the EEA, it would be unduly alarmist to
predict new wars anywhere along the Roman-German frontier. But the lack of
real communication across language barriers, even within cross-cultural
entities like Switzerland, remains striking.
At Salgetsch, where French gives way to German as you go up the Rhone
valley, I had two conversations with two waitresses in bars less than a mile
apart. One spoke French, the other German. Neither knew the other's
language, nor saw any need to. 'Either they speak French, or we make do with
gestures,' said the French one. 'Oh yes,' said her German counterpart
cheerfully, 'we understand each other all right, mit Hand und mit Fuss.' And
she mimed, with clenched fist and outstretched foot, the exact nature of the
relationship.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Bosnian Moslem leader agrees to partition plan for republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday achieved a breakthrough in their efforts
to bring about a political settlement in Bosnia, when Moslem president Alija
Izetbegovic reluctantly agreed to its division into a union of three
republics.
At the same time military commanders of Bosnia's three warring factions
agreed steps to implement an immediate ceasefire in the 16-month war, which
has killed tens of thousands and created 2m refugees.
But Mr Izetbegovic said his agreement was 'preliminary' and conditional on
Bosnian parliament approval. Drawing up precise maps of the proposed Serb,
Croat and Moslem-dominated republics over the weekend would be 'the most
difficult part of the job', he added.
His grudging agreement came on the fourth day of negotiations in Geneva
between the Bosnian factions, plus the presidents of Serbia and Croatia.
Mr Izetbegovic has long clung to the aim of a federal republic with a strong
central government rather than an ethnic carve-up of Bosnia. But with the
Moslems battered militarily and bunched into besieged enclaves, he appears
to have caved in to domestic and international pressure for a settlement
more in line with Serbo-Croat demands for separate ethnic mini-states.
Describing the negotiations as 'very hard', Mr Izetbegovic said it was
eventually agreed Bosnia would remain one state with its international
borders intact rather than an alliance of completely separate states.
The UN said the agreement was not substantially different from the proposal
submitted by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international
mediators. It was reached 'after intensive discussion on a number of drafts,
with amendments agreed by all three parties', a UN official said.
A weak central government would be given control over foreign affairs and
international trade.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic welcomed the agreement. 'It completely
affirms Srpska Republika,' he said in reference to the self-styled Serbian
state, which has militarily extended its sway over 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Mr Mirko Pejanovic, a member of the Bosnian leadership, said the map
negotiations would be 'difficult'. Asked if the deal meant ethnic division,
Mr Pejanovic said: 'It is a heavy price. But it is one we have to pay if
there is to be peace.'
In Sarajevo, the rival military commanders agreed on details of how to
implement the ceasefire at an eight-hour meeting. They agreed to meet daily,
along with UN officials, from tomorrow to ensure the ceasefire held.
The ceasefire was ordered by Bosnia's political leaders on Thursday. Dozens
of previous ceasefire agreements have collapsed but Gen Jean Cot, UN supreme
commander in former Yugoslavia, said there were grounds for more hope this
time.
Earlier, a Spanish soldier was killed and 17 wounded when shells pounded a
UN barracks in Jablanica, south-west of Sarajevo.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Generators may face early MMC referral over pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, is to
decide this year on whether to refer the UK's two main generators to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission after calling yesterday for significant
reform in the power trading market.
His deliberations on the monopolies referral will cast doubt on ministers'
plans to raise Pounds 5.5bn from privatisation sales in 1994-95. The
government would probably be forced to postpone plans to sell the state's 40
per cent stakes in PowerGen and National Power, worth Pounds 3bn, next year
if the companies were referred.
Prof Littlechild's move to bring forward a monopolies decision, previously
expected in 1995, follows a two-month inquiry into price rises in the
electricity wholesale pool where all power in England and Wales is traded.
He said the generators' ability to raise prices, a primary cause of the pool
increases, was a matter of widespread concern.
Prof Littlechild criticised the pool's pricing mechanism. He said it should
be simplified and more attention should be paid to customers' needs. The
pool needed to think 'less about central planning and more in terms of what
the market needs to work effectively'. He also urged changes in
responsibilities between the pool and the National Grid, and backed
proposals that would allow large customers to bypass the pool and buy
directly from generators.
This year's pool selling prices, up 20 per cent on last year, have hit hard
the more than 1,000 large industrial customers such as Imperial Chemical
Industries which buy directly from the pool.
Domestic and commercial users have escaped unscathed because they are
covered by long-term 'hedging' contracts between electricity companies. Prof
Littlechild warned that their prices would be affected in future as new
contracts would take account of pool price changes.
ICI yesterday criticised the regulator for 'taking no firm action' to
correct problems he had identified or compensating those companies that had
paid for the price deficiencies. 'His conclusions are limited to
exhortations to others to consider action, coupled with veiled threats of a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,' the company said.
In his report, Prof Littlechild said the size of the increase was more
attributable to National Power than PowerGen.
National Power said yesterday it was not easy to defend a rising price
during a recession but said its prices were not excessive. It said pool
customers had been enjoying artificially low prices for some time. Most of
those now suffering had previously enjoyed subsidies.
PowerGen said pool prices were not too high when judged against its need to
provide a return on capital and sustain long-term investment.
Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, said an internal review of
operations was already making progress in areas flagged by the regulator
including simplifying trading arrangements.

Students of conspiracy theory and watchers of smoke-filled rooms will be
busy deconstructing Professor Stephen Littlechild's threats to the
electricity generators this weekend. The testy tone of the regulator's
comments suggests he is losing patience with the generators which, despite
four investigations, have continued to push prices up in the 'spot'
electricity pool. If Offer's investigation concludes that the generators'
margins are too high, an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission would naturally follow.
But it may be that the generators would like to provoke Offer into a
decision on a possible MMC referral while the government still holds 40 per
cent stakes in both companies. The shares were due to be sold next spring to
help fund the PSBR. Any MMC referral would delay that and might damage the
value of the holdings. Pressure from the Treasury to avoid a referral would
thus be intense, as the generators are doubtless aware.
Whatever the politics, the two most likely grounds for referral to the MMC
are charges of profiteering or market power. Evidence for excess profits
will have to wait for the results of Offer's investigation, though the
upward drift in prices is disturbing. On market power there is a clear case
for referral. While the generators' overall market share is falling, they
are losing out to nuclear power and shortly to new gas-fired plant, both of
which operate as 'base-load' electricity. The marginal segment of the
market, which determines the price, remains firmly in the hands of the
companies. Whether that will be enough to call the government's hand in such
a high-rolling game of political poker remains to be seen.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the most depressing aspect of Lloyds interim figures is the results
of its retail bank. The limits to growth show clearly in profits before
provisions down 4 per cent despite a 5 per cent fall in costs. Lloyds blames
weak loan demand and the lower income earned on its interest-free
liabilities as a result of lower base rates. But its high return targets
make life particularly hard in such difficult markets. They may have caused
the bank to forgo some lending opportunities, for example in the mortgage
market where other banks have been taking business from the building
societies.
Nor do accounting changes under new European Community rules help. While
Pounds 120m of last year's first half group operating income disappears in
the restatement, the cost income ratio rises to 65.5 per cent and the tier
one capital ratio is suddenly a mere 6 per cent. In short, Lloyds starts to
look much more like an ordinary bank and one with a strategic problem to
boot.
Certainly the stock market seems less impressed by Mr Brian Pitman's magic
touch as chief executive. The shares fell over 4 per cent yesterday even
though LLoyds reported a net return on shareholders' equity of 21.3 per
cent. If Mr Pitman really believes future growth opportunities will be
limited by a non-inflationary environment, he should be rushing to pay
surplus cash back. Ambivalence on this score suggests he is still tempted by
the acquisition route to growth. A weak share price will not make that
approach any easier.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ERM's travails doubtless provoke smug satisfaction within UK government
circles. Yet while ministers are struggling desperately with the urge to
yell 'I told you so', they might also have an eye to sterling's
appreciation. As the CBI warned this week, a rising currency will damp down
export prospects - particularly if the ERM finally disintegrates and some
currencies fall sharply.
The equity market, however, has been buoyed by the notion that UK interest
rates are on the way down regardless. Should Germany change tack and cut
rates to save the ERM, Britain would follow to slow sterling's rise. If
France leaves the system and cuts rates substantially, so would the UK.
Lower rates might tempt more cash out of deposits and into equities, yet the
demanding rating of the market will make upward progress difficult.
Besides, any fall in rates would only offset an effective monetary
tightening from the exchange rate. Overall, the pace of economic growth
might not be much affected, though its composition would be tilted away from
exports towards domestic consumption. If the shift became pronounced,
enthusiasm for overseas earners and export manufacturers would wane, while
dowdy domestic sectors like stores might once again find a place in the sun.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: A faulty mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ERM is clinging to life, but there can only be limited hope of
remission. There have long been only two ways of laying European currency
tensions to rest. Either Germany changes its mind on interest rates, which
seems ever more remote given the weakness of its bond market and of the
D-mark against the dollar and the yen, or France leaves the system so that
it can cut interest rates sharply enough to revive its recession-bound
economy. Perhaps the political capital at stake is too great for European
governments to grasp this nettle. Perhaps they are simply too stunned by the
extent of the crisis that has enveloped the system.
Technical adjustments like a unilateral upward revaluation of the D-Mark or
a widening of bands within the system could never be anything other than a
temporary solution. As long as the interest rate problem is not addressed
the markets will quickly resume their attack. As this thought sinks in,
those involved must turn their attention to who receives the blame. It would
be some consolation for France if the ERM failed because Germany's fears for
its own money supply forced it to withdraw intervention support for the
franc.
Indeed the Bundesbank looks to have lost in terms of credibility. Its
failure to appreciate the international consequences of Thursday's refusal
to cut its discount rate appears naive. Conflicting statements by Bundesbank
council members yesterday over the conduct of day-to-day money market
operations underline the disarray at the top. Independent central banks are
fine as long as they are perceived to be in control. Markets have grounds to
worry when they are not.

FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Heavy profit-taking by
blue-chips lowers Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
HEAVY profit-taking in blue-chip stocks meant US equity markets ended most
lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.95 at 3,539.47.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.11 at 448.13,
while the Amex composite finished 0.41 firmer at 437.00, and the Nasdaq
composite down 2.52 at 704.70. Trading volume on the NYSE was 250m shares.
The markets ended a difficult week on a downbeat note. On Thursday stocks
had posted gains in spite of disappointing news on second quarter economic
growth, primarily because the weak gross GDP led to a sharp drop in bond
yields, which is always good news for equity investors.
Yesterday, however, the markets were unable to sustain their upward momentum
as profit-taking swept the blue-chip sector. Prices opened weaker, but it
was not until bond prices turned notably lower at mid-morning that the
selling in the stock markets gathered pace. The reversal in bond prices,
which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond back up to 6.6 per
cent, was only temporary, and by late afternoon the 30-year yield was back
nearer 6.5 per cent. Among individual stocks, Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing tumbled Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 105 after the big industrial
group announced a modest increase in second quarter earnings to Dollars
331m. The stock declined in spite of a warning from the company earlier this
year about their profits outlook.
The big insurance group Aetna also fell on earnings news, the stock slipping
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 . Walt Disney remained troubled by its
recently disappointing profits report, falling another Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 37 1/2 in volume of 2.5m shares.
Profit-taking took its toll on a variety of leading Dow stocks, including
Allied Signal, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 70 1/8 , Eastman Kodak, down
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 53 3/4 , Coca-Cola, down Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 43
1/4 , and Caterpillar, lower Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 76 7/8 .
Improved earnings continued to help car stocks, with General Motors climbing
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 .
AL Laboratories slumped Dollars 9 to Dollars 14 5/8 in busy trading after
the company warned that it would struggle to equal to match last year's
operating earnings result. On the Nasdaq market, the big story was
Microsoft, which tumbled Dollars 5 to Dollars 74 in volume of 9m shares as
investors reacted negatively to Thursday's late warning from the company
about future revenue growth and software prices, which will be kept low by
competitive pressures. Several leading Wall Street brokerage houses cut
their earnings forecasts after the warning.

the gold index as bullion prices soared.
The TSE composite index gained 9.68 to close at 3,967.23.

FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris at 3-year high in
fevered activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a general consensus that intense shuttle diplomacy, between Paris
and Frankfurt, would take place over the weekend with an announcement on the
future of the ERM coming either on Sunday or Monday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said a
statement had to be made quickly as to how the monetary authorities
intended, if indeed that was their policy, to defend the current parities.
Noting that the outlook for French equities remained uncertain, he said that
he favoured Spain since the Bundesbank was more likely to continue defending
the franc than the peseta.
PARIS closed at its highest level since June 1990 as the opinion took hold
that the ERM was on the verge of break-up. The CAC-40 index closed up 49.88
or 2.45 per cent at 2,085.88 with turnover at an all-time high of FFr11.5bn,
compared with Thursday's FFr4.8bn. The CAC-40 has risen 4.5 per cent over
the week.
With unemployment data yesterday showing, as expected, another rise,
devaluation of the franc followed by cuts in interest rates, will provide
the economic impetus that is sorely needed, market commentators said.
With nearly all stocks showing strong advances, Peugeot featured a 5.5 per
cent gain to FFr683.
MADRID closed off its highs after profit-takers moved in on sharp gains seen
early in the day. The general index finished up 1.78 at 269.96 after a day's
high of 274.03, and 3.5 per cent higher over the week. Trading volume surged
to the second highest level of the year at Pta75bn, compared with an average
of Pta10bn-PTa15bn over the last three weeks.
Mr Hugh Bailey, of Schroders in London, said profit-taking emerged in the
last two hours of trading as currency speculators appeared to ease their
heavy pressure on the French franc, which in turn took some of the pressure
off the peseta.
Gains were focused on the banking sector where Banesto rose Pta125 to
Pta2,170, in spite of announcing an 82 per cent fall in first half profits.
LISBON moved steadily ahead on renewed strong demand for blue chips and the
BTA index added 27.7 to 2,257.6, up 4.2 per cent over the week.
FRANKFURT managed to regain the 1,800 level by the close, having slipped to
an intraday low of 1,799. The DAX index finally closed down 30.47 at
1,803.23, a week's fall of 1.5 per cent. Turnover was DM8bn.
Among the biggest fallers were export-sensitive stocks, while banks also
eased. Deutsche Bank, which has attracted positive recommendations this week
on its interim results, lost DM3 to DM737.
Volkswagen lost DM7.80 to DM348.20; after the close Mr Ferdinand Piech, the
chairman, said that he had offered to meet the head of General Motors.
BRUSSELS rose almost 2 per cent on hopes for a realignment, with
dollar-sensitive and industrial stocks making the largest gains. The Bel-20
index rose 26.35 to 1,326, up 1.5 per cent on the week.
ZURICH was steady, an interested observer of the turmoil elsewhere, and the
SMI index rose 0.3 to 2,400.9 for a 2.1 per cent rise on the week.
'We are staying on the sidelines at present, but if Germany cuts its rates,
then Switzerland would follow suit,' said Mr Mirko Sangiorgio, of Bank
Julius Baer in Zurich. 'The Swiss franc is strong so we have plenty of room
to react.'
Nestle added SFr4 to SFr1,049 in heavy trading in response to its purchase
of Italgel, the frozen foods company, from Sme of Italy.
VIENNA slid in tandem with Frankfurt, and ATX index ended down 21.22 at
948.59, up 1.3 per cent on the week after gains earlier in the week.
AMSTERDAM saw some wild price fluctuations during a session which was
dominated by short-covering in the morning session. The CBS Tendency index
rose 0.7 to 122.0, a gain of 3.4 per cent over the week.
COPENHAGEN retreated a little on late profit-taking but turnover was high at
DKr1bn as the KFX index added 0.57 to 91.87. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index
gained 8.90 to 1,203.00 with Ericsson B shares up SKr9 at SKr373, while
OSLO's all share index was up 1.5 per cent at a new year's high, closing at
531.42. In HELSINKI the HEX index rose 12.3 to 1,287.4.
MILAN made progress in the wake of a firmer lira and a rally in government
bonds as the ERM turmoil improved the prospects of lower interest rates. The
Comit index advanced 2.19 to 563.3, a rise on the week of 2.4 per cent.
Mr Nicholas Potter, of Credito Italiano International in London, commented
that while Italy would not take the lead in a round of interest rate cuts
throughout Europe, it would certainly follow and that would be good for the
corporate sector.
Sme shed L399 or 6.5 per cent per cent to L5,751 with the sale of Italgel
realising less than the forecast price.
ISTANBUL rose 1.2 per cent, the composite index ending up 120.97 at
10,077.60, a week's gain of 3.2 per cent. After the close the central bank
governor announced his resignation, due to long-standing policy differences
with Ms Tansu Ciller, the prime minister.

FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Shipping shares crest the wave of
expectations - A return to favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shipping shares are so often out of fashion with investors that their
advance seems all the more spectacular when they return to favour. Rarely
can the trend have been as apparent as in the last few months, when the
share prices of many European shipping groups have soared from the deeply
depressed levels of last year.
The change owes more to the strengthening dollar and expectations of a
strong recovery in freight rates and ship values than to clear evidence that
such a revival is already underway. Freight rates have recovered modestly
this year, more in the dry bulk sector than in the tanker sector, but are
still well below the peaks of 1990 and 1991. At the same time high operating
costs and financing charges continue to squeeze corporate earnings. Many
shipping companies are expected to publish disappointing results again this
year.
Mr Lau Svensen, analyst at Copenhagen-based Fibroco, comments: 'The recovery
is underway but profits this year will not be much better than last. It is
expectations which are driving share prices higher.'
This view is shared by Mr Mark McVicar, analyst with London-based NatWest
Securities, who says investors are looking beyond 1993 results to 1994 and
beyond.
The Nordic region, which boasts Europe's highest concentration of quoted
shipping groups, shows the effect of the recent recovery clearly. The Oslo
Shipping Index this week reached 587, up 80 per cent since the start of the
year, and more than double last summer's 250 level. The Stockholm shipping
index is now 55 per cent up on the start of the year. At these levels
shipping shares no longer trade at a substantial discount to net asset
value; some are even trading at a premium.
The shipping rally has been fuelled by generally improved stock market
conditions thanks to falling interest rates. There has also been a
preference for some of the quality stocks - companies with blue chip status
and relatively modern fleets.
In Denmark, for example, shares in AP Moller's DS 1912 have risen more than
40 per cent in 1993 from DKr79,000 to DKr111,500, compared to an 18.5 per
cent rise for the Danish market as a whole. Bergesen, the leading Norwegian
bulk shipping group, has seen its shares climb from NKr91.50 to NKr152.50.
However, not all sectors of the market have been able to match the rally put
in by the bulk shipping groups. Companies exposed to the product tanker or
refrigerated cargo markets have not fared nearly as well, because freight
rates in these segments are depressed.
The picture for the major liner shipping companies, such as Dutch group
Nedlloyd and Germany's Hapag-Lloyd, is also much less bright because of
continuing overcapacity on many major routes and worries about the state of
the German and Japanese economies. Hapag-Lloyd, for example, warned last
month that it expected its core liner shipping operations to make a
substantial loss this year, with cargo volumes forecast 8 per cent.
Many analysts believe shipping stocks have further to rise. Many company
share prices are still well below the levels of two years ago, and the Oslo
shipping index has still much ground to make up before it gets back to its
1000 peak in early 1990.
Tanker market fundamentals look better than they have done for some time
with low oil prices, high Opec production and a rising level of US oil
imports. On the supply side too, a slowdown in new building contracting and
an anticipated increase in the scrapping of elderly tanker tonnage suggest
freight rates should rise substantially in the mid-1990s, provided the world
economy does not slow down. With increased environmental and quality
concerns, it may be the operators of modern tanker tonnage who benefit most.
But there is reason for caution too; there have been too many false dawns in
the shipping markets in the last few years, with those expecting major
scrapping activity frequently frustrated by owners' vessel life extension
programmes. Evidence that rates are rising strongly is bound to make owners
reluctant to commit ships to the scrapyard.
While most commentators do not expect a major downward correction, they
believe further gains will require evidence of rising freight rates and ship
values soon. 'A further appreciation in shipping shares must either be based
on an actual rise in ship values or a presumption in the stock market that
this will happen in the not-too-distant future,' says Harald Moraeus
Hanssen, managing director of Oslo-based Fearnley Fonds. If such evidence is
not forthcoming by the end of the year, the market could slip into reverse.

FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases but
Australia surges ahead
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY gains which followed arbitrage buying were eroded when investment
trusts and financial institutions took profits and share prices closed lower
after trading within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 76.71 to 20,380.14, after a high of 20,545.75 and a
low of 20,361.34, for a week's rise of 4 per cent. Foreign and individual
investors were seen buying.
Volume totaled 350m shares against 365m. Declines led advances by 526 to
460, with 185 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks closed down 0.14 at 1,659.91. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index
fell 0.94 to 1,257.07.
Share prices failed to react to the election of Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet
secretary, as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, which is likely to
be the new opposition party. Speculation that the new coalition government,
which will be formed next week, will implement income tax cuts in an effort
to gain support buoyed some housing and consumption related stocks.
Continued worries over construction companies' involvement in the spate of
bribery scandals depressed the sector. Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of
Kajima, resigned as chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
although he denied any links between the scandals and Kajima. Kajima fell
Y25 to Y790, Hazama lost Y9 to Y465 and Shimizu retreated Y26 to Y830.
Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day, jumped Y10 to Y28 on reports
that Namco, a video game maker, was considering extending financial aid to
the bankrupt movie maker. Namco fell Y70 to Y3,660.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 77.79 at 22,464.15 in volume of 12m
shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim saw further records set.
AUSTRALIA soared to post-1987 crash highs after the Reserve Bank eased
monetary policy and gold bullion rose beyond USDollars 400 an ounce.
The All Ordinaries index closed 15.5 higher at 1,844.0, for a week's rise of
2.1 per cent. Turnover was ADollars 876.2m with rises outpacing falls by
four to one. In the media sector News Corp eased 1 cent to ADollars 8.48,
while Nine Network gained 10 cents to ADollars 3.60. Fairfax added 1 cent to
ADollars 2.32.
NEW ZEALAND broke through the 1,800 level for the first time since March
1990, assisted by another sharp rise in Telecom, which closed at a record
high, up 14 cents at NZDollars 3.68, following Thursday's good first quarter
results. The NZSE-40 index finished 33.73 higher at 1,816.04 in turnover of
NZDollars 4.05m.
HONG KONG moved firmly ahead as investors bought blue chips, particularly in
the utilities sector, and the Hang Seng index ended 89.03 or 1.3 per cent
higher at 6,988.96, for a weekly rise of 3.5 per cent. Turnover dipped to
HKDollars 2.78bn compared with Thursday's HKDollars 3.06bn.
MANILA rebounded on strong buying of blue chips and mining issues. The
composite index gained 12.68 to a record high of 1,751.21, up 2.5 per cent
on the week. Turnover was strong at 675m pesos.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to close moderately lower in thin trade after
the central bank cut its secured loan rate by 50 basis points after
Thursday's close.
The weighted index, which had risen some 20 points in early trade, soon fell
back, ending 28.42 down at 3,994.20, off 0.8 per cent on the week.
Turnover was TDollars 12.7bn against Thursday's TDollars 13.6bn.
Many brokers said that the rate cut was positive, confirming the central
bank's commitment to a monetary easing that began in April; but investors
were disappointed that the central bank did not do more.
JAKARTA saw activity rebound with heavy trading in several liquid stocks
which took the official index 2.67 higher to 356.72.
BOMBAY moved sharply higher in spite of end-of-session profit-taking by
speculators and the BSE index rose 99.4 to 2,332.14.

FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Generators firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A preliminary inquiry into electricity industry pricing was greeted calmly
by market watchers who thought that Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
industry regulator, had left open sufficient options for the generators to
respond positively. The relaxed tone in the market enabled National Power to
climb 6 to 367p with PowerGen putting on 7 to 394p.
Several regional electricity companies moved ahead on the wave that has
carried them for several days - their high yields. East Midlands went up 8
to 496p; Northern added 7 to 549p and Seeboard improved 6 to 555p.
There was more positive comment on the possible sale of Augustus Barnett,
owned by Bass, to Allied Lyons' Victoria Wines. Analysts said the final
outcome was likely to involve Bass's being able to continue to supply its
products through the enlarged chain. A price tag of around Pounds 45m has
been put on the proposed deal by analysts. Bass put on 5 to 487p, Allied 4
to 574p.
In telecoms, Investors again shunned BT ordinary shares, which ended the day
a penny down at 414 1/2 p.
Profit-taking left Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) 3 1/2 off at 811p. The stock had
surged on Thursday on the back of a positive message to analysts from Hong
Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a majority stake.
After a dramatic week in the pharmaceutical sector, which saw global tie-ups
in the OTC markets, a Dollars 6bn takeover in the US and the first results
from Zeneca, most stocks stopped to pause for breath. Glaxo weakened as the
market fretted over an important court case due to start soon. The shares
lost 8 1/2 to 547 1/2 p. SmithKline Beecham declined 16 to 445p, Wellcome 8
to 687p and Zeneca 11 1/2 to 634 1/2 p.
Food retail stocks continued their recent rally, with Argyll Group leading
the way. The shares closed 10 ahead at 319p. Elsewhere, Iceland gained 7 to
216p, Morrison 5 to 142p and J Sainsbury 9 to 475p. However, sector
specialists cautioned that the rally was likely to be shortlived as the
problems behind the recent raft of downgrades - such as overcapacity and low
inflation - remained.
Hotel group Forte again hung back in a mostly dull leisure sector as talk of
another large seller was heard. Earlier this week, one institution disposed
of nearly 14m shares giving the stock's highest ever daily turnover of 29m.
Yesterday saw a more moderate 1.4m shares change hands as the stock slipped
a penny to 216p.
Reports of weak European trading at Rank Xerox were said to have impacted on
Rank Organisation, off 8 at 728p.
Stanley Leisure responded to some determined buying by Schroders, the shares
finishing 9 up at 243p.
Nerves ahead of NatWest's interims - due next Tuesday - cut the share price
by 6 to 495p. Barclays slipped back 5 to 482p in a sector generally thought
to have hit the top of its range.
Building stocks with exposure to Germany continued to benefit from the
turmoil in the ERM and hopes of lower interest rates. Redland added 11 to
515p and RMC moved up 8 to 805p. Wolseley put on 8 to 623p in the wake of
NatWest Securities highlighting the stock as a long-term quality investment.
Doubts over relaxation of television takeover regulations took their toll on
television stocks. The market moved on comments by the heritage secretary
and LWT (Hdgs) pfd fell back 8 to 475p; Anglia eased 4 to 334p and Carlton
Communications lost 12 to 1973p.
Stocks with exposure to the French market made gains on hopes of an interest
rate cut. Among these, Arjo Wiggins climbed 9 to 205p, CarnardMetalbox 50 to
2500p and Kingfisher 17 to 634p.

FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds hit by sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER announcing interim results, Lloyds Bank was left largely friendless,
and the share price was driven down 25 to 557p in the highest turnover for
several months at 9.3m.
Some analysts were puzzled at the market's reaction to the figures, which
they considered dull rather than too disappointing for a sector which is
generally going through a tough period. At first the results were cautiously
received; then a fuller slide took shape in later trading as profit-takers
moved in.
While many specialists believe the stock to be fully-valued at its present
level, few were willing to take too negative a tack. Mr Richard Coleman at
James Capel, retaining his hold stance, said: 'It is still very tough in UK
banking as a whole - it is over-supplied. But Lloyds still has the highest
yield in the sector.' One analyst said he was considering changing the
recommendation on Lloyds from a switch/sell to a hold, while another added:
'I don't know what people were expecting. These figures were in line with
forecasts.'
Analysts meet the bank on Monday and will hold off any reviews of their
gradings until then.

FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities boil over as account closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that the turmoil in ERM currencies will swiftly lead to interest
rate cuts throughout the EC continued to drive UK shares ahead yesterday
before the equity market boiled over at mid-session as the end of the
trading account brought out the profit-takers.
Although the FT-SE Index was only 8.9 points up at 2,926.5 at the close,
after showing a gain of 21.9 earlier, there was no relaxation of the nervous
tensions of the previous session. It was a day of rumours, counter-rumours
and denials, mostly from currency traders, and London equity dealers went
home asking themselves whether the French franc - 'or the ERM' - would
survive the weekend.
In the gilt-edged market, long dates added about  1/2 a point, with the
shorts up about  5/32 . The Bank of England announced the issue of a further
Pounds 1.3bn of existing bonds.
After opening quietly, shares moved strongly ahead on widespread demand from
home and abroad, stimulated by rumours, soon denied, that the Bundesbank was
holding a 'special meeting to cut German rates'.
The drive forward again came from stock index futures where the September
contract reached a 20-point premium to trade above the existing peak of the
underling cash market. However, the Footsie topped out yesterday at 2,939.5,
still 17.8 below the closing peak of March 8. The second half of the session
saw both futures and share prices come back smartly.
Last night, the Footsie showed a gain of around 3.3 per cent over the
two-week equity account, accounted for entirely by this week's advance of
98.8 points as currency developments were translated into expectations of
interest rate cuts. The excitement also fuelled gains in the FT-SE Mid 250
Index, up 33.5 to a new peak of 3,306.5 yesterday. The Mid 250 has risen by
103.6 points this week, making a gain of 2.8 per cent over the trading
account.
Seaq volume, swollen by profit-taking, jumped to 763.4m shares from 692m on
Thursday when retail or customer worth rose to Pounds 1.7bn.
Some dealers sounded warning bells when the market turned off so quickly
yesterday. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett commented that the interest
rate cut apparently already factored into the market was 'essential' if the
Footsie was to reach his 3,000 target for this year.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets had another exciting trading session yesterday as
traders reacted to the continuing developments in the ERM currency centres,
writes Terry Byland.
A premium of around 20 points on the September contract on the FT-SE Index
for most of the day offered ample opportunities for arbitraging. These were
readily seized but traders then found that stock in the underlying blue
chips had become very hard to find. At best, September touched 2,963.
By the close, the premium on the September contract had boiled down to
around 17 points against cash. On Monday, fair value will fall to 4 or 5 and
any repetition of yesterday's demand and stock shortage will mean a powerful
squeeze on share prices.
Business in Traded Options increased to 40,488 contracts from 36,070 on
Thursday, with the Footsie option trading 12,265. British Steel (3,874)
headed the list of individual stock options. This was followed by Hillsdown
on 2,307 and Land Securities on 2,100.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Massive ERM intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism appeared to be on the brink of collapse
yesterday after massive intervention from 6 ERM central banks failed to keep
the French franc above its floor in the monetary system, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's currency intervention by the Bundesbank appeared to be in the
order of DM60bn, one of the largest operations conducted by a central bank
in a single day of trading. One Bundesbank council member, Mr Johann Wilhelm
Gaddum, may also have helped to support the franc by saying that German call
money could fall through its discount rate.
But at the end of what was probably the most hectic session of ERM trading
ever, three currencies - the French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone -
were on their ERM floors. After ERM trading closed, central banks did not
support these currencies and the French franc traded below its ERM floor,
coming as low as FFr3.4330 to the D-Mark.
There were strong indications last night that a meeting of the EC Monetary
Committee was being convened, but these could not be confirmed.
At the start of European trading yesterday, the French franc was hovering
above the FFr3.4180 level which the Bank of France had pledged to defend at
the end of last week.
But, at about 0900 GMT yesterday, the French authorities appear to have
allowed the franc to fall to its ERM floor of FFr3.4305. One dealer
suggested that the announcement by Mr George Soros, the hedge fund player,
may have coincided with a wave of speculation by more short term players.
But, by allowing the franc to fall to its floor in the system, France's
tactic may have been to put the onus on the Bundesbank to support the franc,
which it is obliged to do under ERM rules.
'The French have been very clever,' said one analyst. 'They are effectively
saying to the Bundesbank that the only way the system can be saved is by
German intervention or a cut in German interest rates.' However, with the
dollar closing last night at DM1.7405, up nearly a pfennig on the day, the
prospects for a cut were minimal.
There were strong suggestions last night that ERM members could contemplate
a widening of the bands for the core currencies this weekend, broadening the
current permitted fluctuation of 2.25 per cent to perhaps 6 per cent.
But Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, said this
would not be credible in the long term. 'The move would not allow France to
cut interest rates, which is the key to this crisis,' he said.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Flying futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European markets yesterday made up for the complete lack of certainty about
the present by confidently betting on future interest rate cuts, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
In France, the September Pibor contract rose a full 96 basis points, closing
in Europe at 93.72, while in Germany, September Euro-marks gained 13 points
to finish in Frankfurt at around 93.47. Less dramatically, perhaps, trading
in sterling futures also caught the mood, with September sterling up 8 basis
points at 94.42 as the week ended.
Pibor contract's giddy rise was driven by the belief that, come what may,
interest rates would be lower in France by the autumn. With the French franc
still within the ERM at the end of trading, the expectation of lower rates
could clearly not be reflected in lower french money market rates, which
remained high throughout the day.
'This kind of very sharply inverted curve right down the money market curve
is just what you would expect,' said one London-based analyst. 'Forward
rates have to be much lower because we know rates will fall. But we're still
in the dark about the ERM.'
French and German futures were further helped during the afternoon by a
Bundesbank council member's assertion that the German repo rate could fall
below the official discount rate.
In Frankfurt, cash rates were softened by the effect of mass central bank
interventions. These have produced vast quantities of liquidity which the
German authorities made no effort to remove yesterday in any issue of
treasury bills.
Trading in sterling futures appeared to be following events in Europe,
although at least one London analyst considered the market to be making a
mistake.
'If the ERM breaks down,' he said, 'that should mean lower rates in Europe,
which will provide a stimulus to economic activity. To the extent that it
was lack of demand that worried the CBI earlier this week, I do not see why
lower European rates should signal a UK base rate cut before October.'
On balance, the UK markets still seem to favour a cut in official interest
rates between the September and December contracts, as is indicated by the
spread between the two futures contracts. At the end of Friday the gap stood
at around 34 basis points, compared to 25 points on Wednesday.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyre maker which owns Firestone of the US,
yesterday dashed hopes of growth this year, slashing Y9bn (Dollars 85m) from
its forecast for worldwide net profits and saying it expected sales to fall
Y100bn short of original expectations.
It blamed the setback, which would bring a 1.4 per cent dip in earnings
compared with last year to Y28bn, on a poor showing by its domestic
operations. 'Overseas subsidiaries and affiliated companies are still
expected to achieve initially forecast financial performance levels,'
Bridgestone added.
Global sales, at a projected Y1,650bn, would be 5.5 per cent below the 1992
level.
At the Japanese parent company alone, figures released yesterday for the
first six months showed pre-tax profits halved to Y13.76bn from Y28.91bn, on
sales down 11.3 per cent to Y304.2bn.
The weak Japanese economy brought a drop both in the sales of new cars for
which it supplies tyres, and in replacement tyres particularly for
commercial vehicles as road freight slackened.
Exports from Japan were maintained in unit terms but revenues decreased with
the appreciation of the yen.
Non-tyre operations, which represent more than a quarter of the parent's
business, were similarly affected - stronger sales of bathroom fittings and
office materials were not enough to offset weak demand for chemicals, car
seat materials, water tanks and bedding.
The interim dividend is being held at Y6 a share, drawn from net earnings
per share of Y8.11 compared with Y19.83.

FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: India gets a taste of the great
world cola battle - Shira Sidhva finds Pepsi and Coke muscling in for their
share of the country's fledgling softs drinks market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRA SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIANS have done without the real thing for 15 years. Most have done
without any soft drinks at all, with average consumption now at three
bottles per person per year compared with 700 in the US.
However, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and local manufacturers are entering battle for
domination of an already intensely competitive Rs7.5bn (Dollars 240m) market
which, some believe, will expand fourfold in the next five years.
The government, which is seeking foreign investment as part of its economic
reform programme, decided recently to allow Coca-Cola to re-enter India,
after having expelled it in 1978 in a drive to reduce the role of
multinationals in the Indian economy.
Coca-Cola has decided not to go it alone, despite having government approval
to set up a 100 per cent-owned venture. The Atlanta-based company will tie
up with Parle Exports, which dominates the Indian soft drinks market with a
60 per cent share.
Pepsi-Cola International, Coke's arch rival around the world, has built up
an impressive 30 per cent share of the soft drinks market since its entry
two years ago, albeit without using the Pepsi name and operating under
several other government-imposed limits.
Last week, it stepped up its campaign by announcing it would buy out Voltas
Limited, its primary equity partner, to double its stake to 92 per cent in
Pepsi Foods Limited, its food and beverage joint venture.
Pepsi's buy-out will mean greater control of its manufacturing operations in
the key markets of Bombay and Gujarat, currently franchised to Voltas, a
trading, agrobusiness and engineering company owned by the Tata group.
Pepsi executives blame Voltas for Pepsi's inability to make a dent in the
Bombay region, which accounts for nearly 15 per cent of the overall market.
In Bombay, Pepsi and Voltas were taking on Mr Ramesh Chauhan, India's cola
king, who heads Parle. He has managed to make Thums Up a generic name for
cola in India. Thums Up, which accounts for 40 per cent of Parle's soft
drink sales, used lifestyle advertising similar to Coke's 'Can't Beat the
Feeling' 1980s campaigns. The company spent Rs70m on its advertising blitz
last year.
A Parle executive describes the battle with Pepsi as a 'no-holds-barred,
on-the-streets fight - purely a marketing game'.
However, a marketing manager at Pepsi retorts with: 'We were fighting with
our hands tied.' Government restrictions on Pepsi forced the company to use
an indigenous brand name ('Lehar', meaning 'wave') and subjected soft drinks
sales to a ceiling of 25 per cent of the company's annual turnover.
The company says: 'We will now apply to the government to be treated on par
with Coke, and the Pepsi brand name will be introduced soon.'
Coca-Cola and Parle will form two joint ventures, one for bottling soft
drinks (Parle owns two bottling plants in Bombay and Delhi and has 60
franchised bottling plants across India), and the other for marketing the
brands of both companies.
Parle will receive compensation from Coke for putting into the joint venture
its successful brands Thums Up cola; Limca, a cloudy lemon drink; Gold Spot,
orange; Citra, clear lemon; and Maaza, a mango fruit drink.
Pepsi believes Parle's tie-up with Coke will mean that Coke and Parle's
brands will jostle for the Indian cola market to the benefit of Pepsi. 'We
have dealt with Coke in 152 countries, so we know precisely what we are in
for now,' says a Pepsi executive.
Pepsi plans to invest Rs9bn in India, mostly in the soft drinks business.
Sales of its cola have grown 33 per cent in 1992, and are up an additional
24 per cent through the first half of this year. The company believes market
share will increase once Pepsi is allowed to use its global brand name.
Mr Chauhan, however, has a well-entrenched marketing and distribution
network, which he had stubbornly refused to share with a foreign company,
even a month ago. 'Lots of people ask us what we will do to counter Coca
Cola,' he had said. 'We are the market leaders and it is for the new
entrants to work out a strategy to counter us.'

CHRISTOFLE, the French silversmith, yesterday was rescued by its banks when
they agreed to a FFr100m (Dollars 17.2m) financial restructuring package.
The deal should enable the Bouilhet family to retain control of the company.
The Bouilhets, who have run Christofle for six generations, have been
fighting to retain control in the face of a takeover bid by Societe du
Louvre, one of its minority shareholders and a subsidiary of the Taittinger
champagne house.
Christofle reported a net loss of FFr39.5m last year on sales of FFr623m.

jeweller revamp

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARVIN Gerstein, a former chairman of Peoples Jewellers, has blocked the
group's financial restructuring and challenged the court-appointed senior
management to find a better survival plan.
Peoples, Canada's biggest jewellery chain with 220 stores and 1,800
employees, went into bankruptcy protection last December after writing off
its 47 per cent interest in Zale, the troubled US jewellery retailer.
Peoples, together with the Swarovski group of Switzerland, had bought Zale
for USDollars 650m in a 1986 leveraged buy-out. Later, Zale and Peoples were
severely hit by the North American recession.
The restructuring of Peoples, under Ontario court supervision, would have
shrunk Mr Marvin Gerstein's 33 per cent equity stake and the 53 per cent
held by Mr Irving Gerstein, the former president and Mr Marvin Gerstein's
nephew, to 1.5 per cent. Over CDollars 200m (USDollars 156.2m) of debt would
have been converted to equity.
Mr Marvin Gerstein voted against the plan at a shareholders' meeting in
Toronto on Thursday, so that it failed to win a required two-thirds
majority.
A court-appointed receiver, Peat Marwick Thorne, will now decide Peoples'
future unless a last-minute buyer appears.

FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: Microsoft estimates batter
shares
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, dropped
sharply yesterday as analysts cut their estimates for fiscal 1994 earnings.
Microsoft was trading at Dollars 73 1/4 , down Dollars 5 3/4 from Thursday's
close, at midday.
The fall followed a meeting with analysts at the company's Redmond,
Washington, headquarters where Microsoft warned of slower growth in
revenues.
'We are planning for growth, but we do not expect to maintain the 36 per
cent revenue growth rate we achieved in fiscal 1993,' said Mr Mike Brown,
treasurer. First-quarter revenues may be lower than the Dollars 1bn recorded
for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, he added.
Microsoft, which is under investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission
for alleged anti-trust violations, stressed the competitive pressures it
faced in several segments of the software market.
However, the company also boasted it had overtaken competitors in the
markets for spreadsheets and word processors used with the Windows operating
system.
Over the past five years, Microsoft's revenues have grown at an average
annual rate of 46 per cent. However, Microsoft executives highlighted
several market trends that may dampen the company's growth rate this year.
Mr Steve Ballmer, executive vice-president, said much of the growth of
Microsoft's sales had been driven by a transition by PC users to Windows,
from MS-DOS, an older PC operating system program. With 30m copies of
Windows already in use, and sales running at 1.5m copies per month, the
transition period would be completed soon, he said.
Mr Ballmer suggested Microsoft's future growth rate would more closely
reflect growth in the PC market, which analysts said may be in the range of
about 20 per cent per year. He said the company expected more than half of
1994 revenues to come from products introduced during the year, warning that
earnings were becoming increasingly linked to new product cycles.
Pricing pressures, particularly in Europe, could also slow revenue growth,
Mr Ballmer warned. He said Microsoft's competitors were 'being increasingly
aggressive in pricing'. Although PC software companies seldom drop the list
prices for products, the effective selling price is often reduced by
so-called 'competitive upgrades', discounts offered to users of a rival
products.
The price pressure is 'most extreme' in Europe, he said. Lotus Development
in particular was offering products at 'close-to-cost' prices. Microsoft was
'not willing to lose market share. That will guide our pricing actions,' Mr
Ballmer said .
PC manufacturers are increasingly bundling Microsoft Windows and other
software programs with their products, Mr Ballmer noted. This could also
have a dampening effect on revenue growth, although such sales are more
profitable for the software company, he said.
The US Justice Department is to review documents from the US Federal Trade
Commission's anti-trust investigation of Microsoft, according to a report in
the Chicago Tribune. The review signals the department may take up the case,
following two deadlocked votes by the FTC on whether to file a complaint
against Microsoft.

FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: BHF-Bank jumps 23% despite rise
in bad loan provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHF-BANK yesterday reported a jump in earnings for the first half of this
year, but also increased its bad lending provisions to take account of the
poor state of the economy.
The Frankfurt-based merchant bank's group operating profits were 23 per cent
higher during the six months, at DM148m (Dollars 86.8m). This was after
setting aside DM67m against bad loans, up from DM58m in the same period of
1992.
Partial operating profits, which exclude earnings from the bank's trading on
its own account, were up 25 per cent to DM167m.
Like Commerzbank, which this week reported a 16 per cent increase in group
operating profits to DM392m, BHF-Bank said it was feeling the effect of
Germany's weaker economic performance.
Both banks, however, expect continued profits growth this year. Commerzbank
reduced its loan-risk provisions by 20 per cent to DM831m. It said most of
this related to domestic lending, with the recession having a serious effect
on German industry.
Total lending by Commerzbank remained at around the end-1992 level due to
lower credit demand from companies and the bank's selective approach to
lending.
The latest round of German bank results are the first to include details of
their financial precautions against bad and doubtful debts.
Deutsche Bank has already reported a 13 per cent rise in operating profits,
to DM2.6bn, the comparison being with a half of the full 1992 result.
The decision by German banks to release more details of their bad-loan
provisions anticipates a new EC directive requiring greater disclosure for
the full 1993 accounting year.
In Deutsche Bank's case, risk provisions in the first half were up from
DM955m to DM1.38bn.
One of the driving forces behind Commerzbank's profits rise was a sharp rise
in commission income, up by 23 per cent to DM869m. The increase reflected a
steep rise in securities commissions, the bank said.

non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has set up a committee of non-executive
directors with responsibility for corporate governance issues, such as the
appointment and powers of directors, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The move was seen as a further attempt by Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, to
ease shareholder concerns over the composition of the struggling computer
group's board. Mr Gerstner indicated at the time of his appointment in April
that the make-up of the board would be reviewed to ensure it was 'relevant,
appropriate and evolving'.
The committee is chaired by Mr James Burke, a former chairman of Johnson &amp;
Johnson and head of the committee of non-executive directors which picked Mr
Gerstner to head IBM earlier this year.
Mr Burke, an IBM director since 1980, is joined in the committee by other
long-standing IBM directors, including Mr John Opal, a former chairman. Mr
Charles Knight, chairman of Emerson Electric, who was appointed a director
last Tuesday, is the only member of the five-man committee not involved with
the pre-Gerstner regime at IBM.
The board will be responsible for nominating directors for appointment and
'all other issues of corporate governance', IBM said.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is buying the telecommunication cables
business of the Dutch group Philips. The move considerably strengthens the
Finnish group's position in the German market.
The purchase, which is effective on August 1, is being made through Nokia's
57 per cent-owned Dutch cable group NKF on undisclosed terms.
The main operations to change hands are an optical fibre cable factory in
Cologne and a copper cable manufacturing plant in Nuremburg, which together
have some 850 employees and annual net sales of DM300m (Dollars 176.5m). The
transaction does not include Philips' copper cable plant in Cologne, which
the Dutch group has decided to close down.
Nokia has only a small share of the German telecommunication cables market,
through its Monette subsidiary, but the purchase from Philips will give it a
market position of more than 20 per cent.

FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sapporo Breweries lifts payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAPPORO Breweries, Japan's third biggest brewer, is boosting its dividend
for 1993, a year in which it has been increasing its share of a flat market
for beer and will benefit from special gains.
First-half parent company results released yesterday showed sales 3.9 per
cent higher at Y256.3bn (Dollars 2.42bn) and pre-tax profits ahead 5.1 per
cent to Y4.93bn. A 43.6 per cent jump in net earnings to Y2.98bn was
achieved because of a Y2.1bn credit from the liquidation of a can-making
subsidiary.
On a per-share basis net earnings were Y8.91 against Y6.21, from which an
interim dividend of Y3.50 is being paid, up from Y2.50 a share. The annual
payout will rise accordingly to Y7 from Y5, a level which will meet a pledge
made by Sapporo as part of a bond issue last year that it would distribute
at least 35 per cent of earnings.
Full-year profits are forecast to be unchanged at Y10.7bn before tax and 44
per cent higher at Y5.3bn net. Revenues are projected to grow 5.1 per cent
to Y580bn.
In the six months to June its beer division increased interim revenues 3.7
per cent - volume sales were 3 per cent higher although the domestic market
as a whole shrank 1.1 per cent. The overall performance was also assisted by
22.3 per cent growth at its soft drinks side.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Commodities (Week In the Markets): Gold breaks through
Dollars 400 barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK this week inadvertently succeeded where international
speculators had repeatedly failed - by pushing the gold price through the
psychologically-important Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce barrier.
In response to the foreign exchange turmoil caused by the crisis into which
the German central bank's refusal to cut its discount rate had precipitated
the European Community's exchange rate mechanism, the price of the yellow
metal - a traditional haven for money in times of currency uncertainty -
leapt Dollars 11.65 to a post-Gulf War high of Dollars 405.75 an ounce on
London bullion market yesterday.
Yesterday's rise built on earlier gains reflecting concern about last
weekend's violence in South Africa, the biggest gold producer, and the
publication of a series of strong US economic indicators. But these factors
had never threatened to lift the market out of its Dollars 388- to Dollars
395-an-ounce range, let alone to encourage a fresh assault on the Dollars
400 mark.
Attempts to clear that hurdle two and a half weeks ago faltered in the face
of stiff overhead resistance and the dispirited bulls allowed the price to
settle back into its restricted range. But they had not abandoned all hope
and this week's ERM crisis provided just the excuse they had been looking
for to renew their efforts.
The silver and platinum markets joined in the fun, the former ending 37
cents up on the week at Dollars 5.37 1/2 an ounce and the later Dollars 9.45
up at Dollars 413.60 an ounce.
At the London Metal Exchange, meanwhile the exchange authorities stepped in
to stop the fun some copper market operators are suspected of having in
recent weeks.
After expressing concern two weeks ago about technical supply tightness that
was developing for the September-early October period, Mr David King, the
chief executive, reacted this Thursday to continuing signs of market
manipulation with a stern warning that the exchange 'will not hesitate to
take such steps as are deemed necessary in the light of any changing
situation'.
The authorities concern was caused by a growing premium being charged for
September delivery over the three months position, which had reached Dollars
17 a tonne. Such a situation - known in the trade as a 'backwardation'
because it is a reversal of the normal situation where forward positions
command premiums over nearbys - is usually associated with supply tightness,
an explanation that hardly applies at the moment, with LME warehouse stocks
close to a 15-year high.
The guilty parties seemed yesterday to be paying little heed to Mr King's
warning; the September-October premium had narrowed by only Dollars 1 a
tonne by the close. And in defiance of the clearly bearish fundamentals the
three months position edged up another Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1,967.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 56.75 on the week, while cash metal was up Dollars 10.50
on the day and Dollars 61 on the week at Dollars 1,971.50 a tonne.
The nickel market's fundamentals are still more bearish - LME stocks have
reached a record 101,568 tonnes - and there has been no attempt to defy
them. This week saw a technical rally from the six-year lows reached on
Monday, but that ran out steam yesterday, when the three months price fell
back by Dollars 87.50 to Dollars 4,940 a tonne, up Dollars 30 on balance.
The tin market had few friends as the recent gentle downtrend in stocks was
reversed and demand remained slack. The three months LME price closed
yesterday at Dollars 4,887.50 a tonne, down Dollars 57.50 on the week and a
fresh 20-year low.
The mood of the coffee market was altogether more cheerful. Although the
Brazilian frost scare that pushed the London Commodity Exchange's September
robustas position above Dollars 1,000 earlier this month had all but faded
from traders memories, increasing faith in producers' determination to make
their export retention scheme effective kept the market on the uptrend. The
September futures price touched a seven-month high of Dollars 1,044 a tonne
yesterday, before closing at Dollars 1,037 a tonne, up Dollars 44 on the
week.
As Latin American producers met in Rio de Janeiro this week to thrash out
details of the cartel through which they plan to operate their agreed 20 per
cent retention of scheduled exports, coffee traders continued to withdraw
from the scepticism with which they had initially greeted the scheme.
'The retention scheme is now almost a fact of life,' one trader told the
Reuter news agency. 'The only thing now is how long it's going to last and
what will be the effect.'
Having accepted that the Latin Americans mean what they say the coffee
market is looking with growing interest towards their meeting next month in
Kampala, Uganda, aimed at agreeing a co-ordinated retention plan. Mr Arega
Worku, scecretary-general of the Inter-African Coffee Organisation, said
yesterday that ministers from African producing countries, Brazil, Colombia,
Indonesia and Central America would meet on August 16 and 17. He said the
scheme should be in place the start of the 1993-4 coffee marketing season on
October 1.
The coffee retention plan has been well-timed, according to the latest
coffee report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. 'Producer stocks are
low and exportable production is around or below annual international
demand, which we estimate at some 74m bags.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM Midshires building society, the 13th largest in the UK, has
acquired the bulk of the UK residential mortgage portfolio of Canada's Royal
Trust Bank.
The purchase price of Pounds 160m is close to the level at which the
mortgages are carried on the books of Gentra, RT Bank's Toronto-based
parent. Most of the mortgages cover properties in southern England.
Gentra, formerly known as Royal Trustco, is selling its operations to Royal
Bank of Canada. The proceeds from the UK sale are required to make up a
shortfall in the value of loans sold to Royal Bank.
Gentra said it was negotiating the sale of the rest of its UK residential
mortgages and another deal was expected to be finalised next month.
The assets sold to Birmingham Midshires make up about 40 per cent of RT
Bank's real estate exposure. The bank is also trying to sell parts of its UK
commercial and retail property loans.
RT Bank, which has had a presence in London for more than 60 years, is
unlikely to survive for long as a separate entity. Royal Bank is taking over
its treasury operations and liabilities, while Gentra is shrinking its asset
base.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, disclosed a 71
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 75.3m in the
six months to June 30 after provisions for bad and doubtful debts eased.
Provisions fell to Pounds 75.3m (Pounds 98.5m) as the society did not have
to repeat provisions made last year to cover commercial lending and
inherited loans from its merger with the former Portsmouth Building Society.
The society's assets rose by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 16.5bn (Pounds 15.3bn)
as mortgage lending rose 4.6 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn helped by fixed rate
products. However, the society predicted that lending for the year would be
down on 1992.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said it was 'a solid performance in a
sombre market'. The society discloses half-year results because it has
issued permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs).

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing deal secured for FNFC as losses
fall

FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group which earlier
this year found itself in breach of banking covenants, has narrowly avoided
collapse by clinching a refinancing deal for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to
107 international banks.
Had the refinancing not been agreed, the group could have been forced to
call in administrators. This is the second time in 20 years that FNFC has
come close to collapse. It was rescued by the Bank of England after the
banking crisis in the mid-1970s.
The deal was finally signed late Thursday night, after the company gave
written assurances to a US bank that all creditors would receive equal
treatment. Agreement opened the way for FNFC to resume dividend payments
after two years and report its interim results, showing a reduction in
pre-tax losses from a restated Pounds 39.6m to Pounds 3.35m for the six
months to April 30.
FNFC has won a five-year breathing space for repayment of its Pounds 1.1bn
debt. The banks are not providing any new funds. In return, FNFC has agreed
to wind down the lossmaking First National Commercial Bank, which provides
term lending to property orientated businesses. It has also agreed to
tighter covenants on gearing ratios.
Mr Tim Ingrams, finance director, said the deal put the company on a firm
financial basis. Borrowing costs were expected to be 0.8 per cent higher.
The group's difficulties stem from the breach of one covenant in 1988 which
was discovered this year. This related to a ban on loan guarantees between
subsidiaries and the parent. Cross default agreements meant all creditors
could call for immediate repayment of debts when it was discovered that this
ban had been breached. Although FNFC had not defaulted on its repayment
obligations, discovery of the breach following two years of heavy losses is
thought to have made creditors nervous.
FNFC's debt can be split into three parts - loans to First National Bank of
Pounds 788m, loans to FNCB of Pounds 236m, and loans to the parent of about
Pounds 90m.
The group intends to repay the banks largely through securitising the assets
of its main operating subsidiary, FNB. This, in effect, means packaging
parts of the loan portfolio and putting them into an off balance sheet
vehicle. This then raises cash by issuing notes to investors.
Part of the refinancing agreement calls for 90 per cent of First National
Bank's future business to be 'securitiseable'.
FNCB's debt will be repayable as its loan book is run down. Loans to the
parent will be repaid with cash from January's Pounds 45m rights issue and
property sales. Costs of negotiating the refinancing are expected to be
about Pounds 5m.
In its results, prepared in accordance with FRS 3, the group declared a
dividend of 0.5p. Mr Ingram said that restrictions on pay-outs by
subsidiaries to the quoted parent meant there would be no great increase in
dividends from FNFC for a few years. Losses per share fell to 2.5p (21.7p).
FNFC's core consumer credit business showed a Pounds 10.4m profit (Pounds
12.8m losses). Commercial lending, earmarked for closure, incurred heavier
losses of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.5m).

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: SEET reduces losses and borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEET, the textiles company, cut losses from Pounds 370,138 to Pounds 60,840
in the year to April 30 and Mr Jock Mackenzie, the chairman, reported that
the company's financial position had also strengthened materially in the
period.
This improvement had arisen from the settlement of the Homemaker action in
June last year, the sale of Kenneth Mackenzie in November and the settlement
of a professional negligence claim in April this year.
As a result of the sale of Kenneth Mackenzie Holdings for Pounds 1.25m last
October and the receipt of money from the US following litigation there,
group net borrowings at the year end were reduced from almost Pounds 2m to
under Pounds 300,000, and since then there had been a further improvement.
Mr Mackenzie said all operations were now trading profitably.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 7.14m). Losses were struck
after exceptional credits of Pounds 333,031 (Pounds 50,592) and net interest
payments of Pounds 148,853 (Pounds 218,660). Losses per share came to 1.8p
(9.07p).

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals in merger talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPA MINERALS, a small UK mining finance house, is having negotiations
about a three-sided merger with Burmine and Austmin Gold, two Australian
companies with which it is already closely involved.
In addition Mount Edon, another Australian concern, had made an approach
which might lead to an offer.
Europa's two independent directors, Mr Campbell Douglas and Mr Peter
Ronayne, are backing the merger with Burmine and Austmin. An independent
review of asset values is to be made before formal terms are announced, but
they are likely to involve shareholders receiving one Burmine share for
every two Europa.
With Burmine's shares at ADollars 1.90 (85p) each this indicates a value of
about 42p for each Europa ordinary and Pounds 10.3m for the company.
The Europa price slipped 2p to 35p immediately after the news. It has been
as low as 3p in the past year and in June 1992 only 16 per cent of a rights
issue of shares at 5p was taken up.
Trading is expected to begin again today in Australia in both Burmine and
Austmin shares which were suspended after a previous announcement that the
three-way restructuring was a possibility,
Mount Edon, a small Australian mining company backed by Swiss money, said it
had bought another 10 per cent of Europa, taking its interest to 18 per cent
and that it might make a share or cash offer, or a combination of the two,
for the rest.
Mount Edon is understood to have paid a maximum of 33p each and to have
indicated it might bid 34p.
Europa's principal investments are oil and gas royalties and 41.8 per cent
of Burmine, a gold producer in Western Australia.
Austmin, an exploration company, owns 19.8 per cent of Europa. Burmine would
also offer one share for every 11 Austmin, but this would exclude Austmin's
18.1 per cent stake in Consolidated Exploration.
Europa's independent directors argued that the merger would enable the
complex shareholdings to be simplified. They also considered that the
group's combined strength could be more easily recognised by the market and
provide a foundation for future growth.
Under the proposals Europa and Austmin would own 20 per cent and 7 per cent
respectively of Burmine. These cross holdings would be placed to raise
additional cash for the enlarged group which would have a market price of
about ADollars 62m.
