FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: John Lusty losses grow to Pounds 2.25m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN LUSTY Group, the USM-quoted food manufacturer formerly known as Dumas
Group, reported pre-tax losses up from Pounds 970,000 to Pounds 2.25m for
the year to January 31.
Turnover for the year rose slightly, from Pounds 8.62m to Pounds 8.68m. Of
this, continuing operations were responsible for Pounds 7.94m (Pounds 7.7m).
Losses per share were 19.38p (15.34p).
Mr David Hamp-Adams, who took over as chairman after the company's
restructuring and name change in February this year, said discussions were
under way regarding the sale of Bender and Cassel, which no longer fitted
with the group's core activities.
The restructuring of the group had already begun to pay off, he said, and
despite poor trading conditions, its future now looked more secure than it
had for some time.

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Anglia Secure Homes cuts deficit to Pounds
2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIA Secure Homes, the builder and manager of retirement homes, achieved a
reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds 2.3m in the six
months to end-March.
Turnover improved to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 6.57m) including a Pounds 2.2m
(Pounds 2.1m) contribution from Haven Services, 51 per cent owned by Anglia.
The pre-tax result was after a fall from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 508,000 in
exceptional costs and reduced interest payments of Pounds 748,000 (Pounds
1.31m).
Losses per share fell to 7.2p (15.4p) and there is no dividend. Anglia last
paid a dividend in respect of the year to September 1989. Its share price
reached a peak of 458p in March that year, before a collapse in demand for
housing. The shares closed unchanged at 6p yesterday.
However, Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, said that prices 'do appear to have
reached their floor'. Average prices on the 61 units sold in the six months
were Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 60,000).
He said that five projects to develop and operate nursing homes were
underway with Haven Healthcare Holdings, in which Anglia had a 28 per cent
stake. The group was in discussions with its principal bankers to separate
its property assets and associated debts from the Haven operations, on which
the group had pinned its future hopes, he added.

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds ahead 35% to Pounds 498m - Outcome
boosted by release of Pounds 154m problem country debt provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK yesterday disappointed the market with half-year results which
showed pressure on retail banking income from slack domestic loan demand.
This was despite a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 498m,
against Pounds 369m.
The pre-tax figure was in line with expectations, but was helped by a higher
than expected release of problem country debt provisions of Pounds 154m.
This made its problem country debt unit the most profitable of the bank's
operating sectors.
Lloyds nonetheless covered its dividend 3.5 times after raising it 12 per
cent to 6.6p (5.9p), and Mr Brian Pitman, the bank's chief executive, said
it was considering ways to redistribute excess capital as earnings grow.
Mr Pitman said Reuters' recently announced scheme to spend Pounds 350m
buying back 5.8 per cent of its own equity was 'very intriguing' although he
had not yet studied it closely. This was one possibility for handing back
excess cash.
Since Lloyds' failed bid to buy Midland last year, there has been
speculation over how it will spend capital. Mr Pitman said it would have to
choose when its ratio of equity to total assets rises from the current 4.4
per cent to 6 per cent.
The bank was affected by falls in base rates, which reduced earnings on UK
interest-free deposits. It lost earnings of Pounds 39.4m on interest-free
funds of Pounds 6.4bn as the net interest margin narrowed to 3.97 per cent
(4.36 per cent).
This squeezed income in UK retail banking, where it made a profit of Pounds
17m (Pounds 3m loss). Operating profits fell by 4 per cent despite a 5 per
cent reduction in costs, and provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to
Pounds 209m (Pounds 241m).
Mr Pitman said this was a 'hopeless' return on equity of about Pounds 1bn,
but the bank believed it could raise returns substantially as provisions
fell by cutting costs at 1 per cent per year while raising income 5 per cent
a year.
Some of Lloyds' ratios were affected by the adoption of an EC directive
which requires grossing up of assets, and a new Statement of Recommended
Accounting Practice. The bank also adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard for
the first time.
These changes lowered the restated tier 1 ratio of core capital to
risk-weighted assets to 6 per cent (6.2 per cent restated from 6.7 per
cent). Including unaudited retained profits, the figure would rise to 6.5
per cent.
The ratio of costs to income fell to 65.5 per cent (67.1 per cent restated
from 63 per cent).
The bank's total operating profit before provisions rose by 10 per cent to
Pounds 632m (Pounds 577m restated). But costs rose by Pounds 25m (2 per
cent) on exchange rate movements despite a 4 per cent reduction in the
number of employees to 62,551.
Assets grew 7 per cent on the end of 1992 to Pounds 74bn. Holdings of debt
securities rose to Pounds 4.7bn (Pounds 3.4bn), and the acquisition of the
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation added Pounds 1bn. Customer loans rose
marginally to Pounds 39.1bn (Pounds 38.8bn).
Mr Pitman said the scope for growing domestic loans was limited by the fact
that inflation has fallen. He said the bank would try to generate added
income by being more imaginative in devising personal savings products.
Provisions fell 34 per cent to Pounds 138m (Pounds 209m), as the bank's
problem country debt unit made a profit of Pounds 176m. Excluding the
problem country debt provision release, the charge of Pounds 292m was 6 per
cent down on the first half of 1992.
Earnings per share rose 43 per cent to 23.5p (16.4p) and net assets per
share rose 13 per cent to 232p (205p).
The shares closed 25p down at 557p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Platforms, the USM-quoted computer hardware and software group, cut
pre-tax losses in the year ended March 31 from Pounds 847,471 to Pounds
405,368.
The latest result was struck after Pounds 98,000 provisions for the costs of
restructuring continuing operations.
The company has reduced its workforce substantially and closed its sales
office in Andover, Hants. Current contracts are such that Standard has a
backlog of over Pounds 400,000 and since most of this work will not be
invoiced until the next financial year, the company is still dependent on
the continued support of its bankers.
Turnover grew to Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 1.61m) while losses per share were
10.1p (21.5p).

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Start-up costs hit Zetters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The start-up costs for a division to supply telephone-interfaced information
technology was the main factor behind a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
1.04m to Pounds 880,000 in the year to March 31 at Zetters Group.
The costs led to increased operating losses of Pounds 155,000 (Pounds
21,000) in the competitions and marketing activities. The profits from pools
fell to Pounds 812,000 (Pounds 844,000) after lower interest received.
Group turnover was Pounds 22m (Pounds 22.9m) of which pools provided Pounds
21.5m (Pounds 22.4m). Earnings per share were 8.9p (10p). An unchanged final
dividend of 4p is proposed for a maintained total of 8p.

SG WARBURG, global co-ordinator of the British Telecom public offer, has
paid Pounds 384m to buy an additional 91.5m shares from the government to

The total number of British Telecom shares sold by the government now comes

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink expands in resins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLSTENHOLME Rink, the printing industry supplier, has bought the varnish
and resins division of Leon Frenkel, a privately-owned company in Kent, for
Pounds 3.93m
An initial payment of Pounds 3.15m will be satisfied by the issue of 350,000
shares at 460p and Pounds 1.54m in cash. The shares have been placed by
Cazenove and Henry Cooke Lumsden, the placing being underwritten by
Cazenove.
The final Pounds 775,000 will be paid after Frenkel has moved its other
businesses, involving the mixing and bottling of cooking and salad oils,
from the building which houses the varnishes division and is expected to be
made within two years. The sale proceeds will be used to finance the move to
a new factory near the existing site.
In the year to the end of October 1992, the resins and varnish division made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 161,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.7m out of group
profits of Pounds 755,000 and turnover of Pounds 24.3m.
The acquisition continues Wolstenholme's policy of making acquisitions
geared to international expansion, which began with its takeover of PCO, the
Netherlands-based speciality chemicals group in 1991.
Varnishes, and the resins are used to manufacture them, make up the liquid
element of printing inks and the purchase completes a vital piece of the
printing products jigsaw for Wolstenholme.
Mr Tony Rink, Wolstenholme's joint chairman, said: 'We are building a
portfolio of products that we can sell to the international print ink
industry.'
Wolstenholme's share price closed unchanged at 475p.

FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BET sells hire side to Hewden Stuart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWDEN STUART, the plant hire company, is buying Hireplant, a general plant
and tool hire business, from BET for Pounds 10.8m in cash.
The deal is being partly financed through a placing, organised by James
Capel, to institutional shareholders of 6m new ordinary shares each at a
price of 119p. The shares closed up 2 1/2 p at 121p yesterday.
Hireplant has some 400 employees, operates 24,000 items of plant and has its
head office near Oxford. It is an amalgamation of the general plant and tool
hire activities of BET, the business services company, which until about two
years ago traded under their own names.
Hewden Stuart will acquire the 29 freehold properties and 10 leasehold
properties through which Hireplant operates. Its depots are spread
throughout the UK, although many are located in the Midlands and south of
England.
Five are in Scotland, under the name of Bob Tait Plant, which has a separate
operation with its own head office.
Current budgets of Hireplant, for the year ended March 311994, estimate
turnover of Pounds 16m and a trading loss of Pounds 500,000.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: Better deal for small investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr M E R ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex suggests ('Sharelink', July 24/25) that 'without further tax
incentives from government, the high ideal of a share-owning democracy will
remain no more than that'.
Perhaps a more effective incentive would be for market makers to reduce
their bid-offer spreads? A Pounds 1,000 purchase typically returns Pounds
725 to Pounds 925 on selling at an unchanged mid-price, with Pounds 20 to
Pounds 200 going to the market maker, depending on the liquidity of the
security, Pounds 50 to the stockbroker and Pounds 5 to the government in
stamp duty.
If everyone received as little as the government, the small investor would
be well served.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: Conservation dependent on right economic focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J HUGH FAULKNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sustainable development is not conservation for its own sake, as you
suggest, ('Clarifying the green agenda' July 21). It is, as the Bruntland
Commission says, 'development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' -
surely a goal we all share.
To achieve it, we must use all our resources - finite or not - more
efficiently, and less wastefully. To encourage this means costing those
resources realistically - including environmental costs - paying those costs
and including them in both national and corporate accounts. Economic reforms
are therefore the key to more efficient use of resources.
As you say, 'it is a time for priorities'. But you overlook a main priority:
the urgency for governments to step up their efforts to internalise
environmental costs - specifically through applying economic instruments on
a wider scale, and at a faster pace. They undertook to do this at Rio.
Internalising environmental costs will benefit:
a) business, by encouraging firms to become 'eco-efficient' - adding value
to products, while using raw materials and energy more efficiently, and
minimising pollution. This in turn will create competitive advantage,
improve corporate returns and reduce risk.
b) government, as a more cost-effective, flexible and successful alternative
to command-and-control
c) environment - including addressing many of the issues you question as
really important.
Indeed, because few other, if any, single public policy actions would
achieve so many benefits, this should be an item marked 'high priority for
action' on everyone's agenda - government, business and environmentalists.

Sir, the MIT professors and Nobel laureates, in their early burial of the
European Monetary System, reminded me of Mark Twain's quote, 'The
announcement of my death is premature'. Although I am not an enthusiast of
the ERM, I was astonished to see no mention of a large realignment as a
possible solution to the current ERM crisis.
Since I co-share the authors' (presumed) preference for living in a world of
fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, I cannot see what their advocacy of a
'new EMS' can bring as new to lay down the stepping stones of a future
international monetary system.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: ERM: Arguments favour giving priority to monetary
policy and a large realignment (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The economic case argued by the 'MIT Six' (Personal View, July 29) for
the burial of the exchange rate mechanism is as welcome as it is
irrefutable.
The Six, however, were late in changing their views. One of them, Rudiger
Dornbusch, is on record at a G7C meeting only 14 months ago in claiming that
there was nothing wrong with the ERM that a lira devaluation would not cure.
The Six indeed have to explain away their erstwhile support of the ERM. They
thereby assert that the ERM in its early years was a good system in inducing
reductions in inflation but somehow it became rigid and perverse.
As you know, together with a very few others, I have argued that there is no
evidence that the ERM countries reduced inflation any faster than the
outsiders, that the ERM was and is inherently perverse and unstable, and
that the political-market forces would induce the same sort of rigidity that
we saw in Bretton Woods.
All these dynamics, masked until 1990 by exchange controls, became quite
clear over the last three years. Black Wednesday was merely one culmination;
there are others to come.
But what concerns me in the MIT Six article is the stress they appear to put
on targeting unemployment - 'putting unemployment at the top of the list (of
priorities)'. So we may well risk falling out of the ERM frying pan into a
Keynesian inferno.
Targeting unemployment, as we know from the post-second world war years,
gave us eventually even higher levels of unemployment and rampant inflation.
Surely the first priority should be stable monetary policy, not
unemployment. At the very least a stable monetary policy should save us from
the exacerbations of inflation and recession that we have experienced,
either outside or inside the ERM, by pegging sterling to the D-Mark.

FT  31 JUL 93 / A blow for compromise and conciliation: Israel's military
attacks in south Lebanon have damaged Middle East peace hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Middle East abhors a diplomatic vacuum like no other part of the world.
If it is not trying to resolve the worst of its problems through
negotiation, then the danger is always there that it will blunder again into
war.
The latest, and objectively the best hope for resolving the Arab-Israel
conflict peacefully sprang out of the war in the Gulf. Some 20 months after
Iraq's forces were driven out of Kuwait, the long-festering crisis of
Israel's relations with its Arab neighbours was brought to the negotiating
table in Madrid. Some 21 months later, with no progress to show, the guns
are again firing, civilians are dying and the pitiable sight of hundreds of
thousands of refugees fills television screens.
Once again, for the third time in 15 years, it is the Lebanese people who
are paying the price for the failures, ambitions and short-term political
manoeuvring of the region's leaders. This week's relentless attack on the
country by Israel, which has already forced at least 250,000 people from
their homes, killed 120 and wounded hundreds more, serves interests far
removed from those which support conciliation and compromise.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, clearly believes that the
military operation is necessary for his government and for his country.
Earlier this month, seven Israeli soldiers were killed by guerrillas in
south Lebanon, in the slice of territory (about 10 per cent of the country)
Israel has occupied since its two earlier ill-fated invasions of 1978 and
1982.
Then, as now, the declared aim is to rid the south of Lebanon of guerrilla
forces capable of challenging the occupation and of firing rockets into the
northern tip of Israel. This time, however, Israel is trying a new tactic.
By deliberately driving out the population of the south and making their
towns and villages uninhabitable, Mr Rabin is hoping to create such a mass
of refugees that the governments of Lebanon and Syria will be forced into
taking action against the guerrillas.
Israel's prime minister has long believed, along with many of his
colleagues, that force can only be answered by force. He was elected a year
ago on the twin pledge of peace and security. He has not delivered peace, so
the need to ensure security has become even more politically imperative. Mr
Rabin may also calculate that the risks to the peace process are secondary
and containable. He well knows, as do his Arab negotiating partners, that
Israel is totally dominant in the region militarily. Since the collapse of
the Soviet Union, those Arab countries most opposed to Israel have lost
their main military supplier and most constant diplomatic supporter. The
risk of a Middle East conflict spilling over into the third world war has
gone.
Israel, meanwhile, has deepened the already close relationship with its most
fervent champion, the US. Washington, in its turn, has declared a policy of
seeking to deny Iran and Iraq, potentially the two most powerful economic
and military powers in the region, the means to develop their influence.
Seen from Jerusalem, it must appear that Israel and the US have the power to
dictate events in the Middle East as never before.
It is a view shared by many Arab governments. Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the
Palestinians went to Madrid and the nine subsequent rounds of negotiations
in Washington because it was the only formula remaining which might, with US
involvement, lead to the return of their land occupied by Israel in the 1967
war, as demanded in two UN resolutions.
They came to the table essentially as supplicants with little to offer,
except the prospect of peace treaties. For governments which until recently
had beaten the drum of Arab nationalism, Palestinian self-determination, and
unending resistance to Israeli ambitions, it was a chastening and
potentially humiliating experience. And the less they achieved, the greater
would be the embarrassment of justifying their actions in front of their own
populations.
By attacking Lebanon in the manner it has, Israel is seeking to strip the
last remnants of their formerly hostile political clothing from them. Syria,
and the Lebanese government on which it has such strong influence, are being
told by the Israelis to put an end to the military activities of Hizbollah,
the Iranian-supported group which proclaims that it is fighting a war of
national liberation in south Lebanon. Without the curbing of Hizbollah, the
civilians of the south will not be allowed to return to their shattered
homes, and Lebanon's attempts at reconstruction will come to nought.
But Hizbollah is more than a guerrilla movement. It also enjoys widespread
support among the Shia community in Lebanon, runs an extensive social
welfare programme and won eight seats in the last parliamentary elections.
Lebanese ministers are well aware that the only way to reduce Hizbollah's
growing influence is by raising the overall economic well-being of Lebanon,
a process which Israel has now put firmly into reverse. The parallels with
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza are obvious. There, too, Israel's
response to the Palestinian uprising has led to greater economic hardship
and an erosion of the popular support for the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, which gave its blessing to the peace process, and a political
boost to the radical Islamic forces, which oppose it.
For those Israelis who prefer the present situation to the alternative
sought by the Arab negotiators, such developments are not unwelcome. It
enables them to argue, especially in front of a US audience, that radical
Islam has now become the most potent threat not just to Israel, but also to
most of the western world.
How fully the US accepts this assessment may be clearer in the next few days
when Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, sets out once more for
the region with his prime objective of promoting peace again overshadowed by
the need to limit the damage of war.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Fading sound of music: Why there may be a requiem for one of
the world's finest piano makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is hardly a musician who does not know about Bech-stein, one of the
world's finest pianos, whose keys were played by Richard Wagner and Franz
Liszt. There is hardly a Berliner who would not demand its rescue as
bankruptcy now hangs over the 140-year-old company.
Bechstein has had an uphill struggle since it was bought by Mr Karl Schulze,
regarded as a master piano maker, from the US-based Baldwin keyboard
manufacturers in 1985. Mr Schulze had only one aim: to restore the
international reputation of this grand concert piano.
Baldwin had acquired the renowned established family business in the 1960s,
and afterwards, the quality of the pianos was compromised, experts say. Its
infrequent presence on the concert platform seemed to confirm this
perception. Before the second world war, Bechstein and Steinway competed
with each other to grace the world's concert halls, Today, about 90 per cent
of them are using Steinway, followed by the Vienna-based Bosendorfer.
'Baldwin is a good American firm. It thought it could sell more pianos by
capitalising on the name. But each piano has to be crafted, individually
made, and cared for,' said Mr Roger Willson, manager of Whelpdale, Maxwell
and Codd, a piano manufacturer, and the sole importer into the UK of
Bechstein.
Soon after acquiring Bechstein, Mr Schulze bought new premises in west
Berlin, not far from Checkpoint Charlie, the main crossing point between
east and west Berlin, and with help of 68 craftsmen, revived traditional
piano-making skills. By the early 1990s, the company was making 350 concert
grands and 600 uprights a year. Mr Schulze, confident about the future,
decided to expand. He bought a small piano factory in Bavaria, as well as
the established Zimmermann piano factory in the eastern German state of
Saxony. Then things started to go wrong.
An explanation is offered by Mr Willson. 'The recession hit him badly,' he
said. 'You see, about 60 per cent of our sales of Bechstein, and Bluthner,
another great German piano manufacturer located in Leipzig, is sold to the
older generation. With the fall in housing prices, especially in Britain,
people held back. These are expensive instruments.' A Bechstein grand costs
between DM80,000 (Pounds 31,128) and DM100,000, and an upright between
DM18,000 and DM30,000.
As a result of the recession, piano sales in the UK fell last year by 15 per
cent, to between 10,000 and 12,000. Worldwide, 680,000 pianos were sold,
270,000 fewer than in 1991. The market faces growing competition from Japan,
and especially South Korea and China, which have exploited the global
downturn by offering low prices and somewhat inferior quality. But, when it
comes to concert grands, the Japanese are up against a bias which favours
European tradition and craftsmanship.
Some German bankers say that Mr Schulze expanded at the wrong time. But
another factor could be that unlike his competitors, Steinway and
Bosendorfer, both of which are owned by US companies, Beckstein has no
private backers. 'He did it alone. It would be a shame to see Bechstein
disappear,' said Mr Michael Glazebrook, director of technical services at
Steinway.
Because of the recession, Bechstein's bankers, Dresdener and Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank in Berlin, have been reluctant to provide loans of about
DM3m to the company, which saw turnover fall by 15 per cent to DM20m last
year. This year it may be even lower, at DM15m. Without financial backing
from the Senate, Berlin's city government or from a consortium of bankers,
Bechstein could be forced into liquidation.
The irony is that Bechstein's bankers have refused their support at a time
when other great piano manufacturers, particularly those in east Germany,
are slowly re-establishing their reputations. These include Bluthner and
Zimmermann, both based in Saxony.
Bluthner was founded in 1853, and was chosen for concert performances by
Felix Mendelssohn, Arthur Rubenstein, and Claudio Arrau, the latter one of
the finest interpreters of Beethoven's sonatas. Ingbert Bluthner, a direct
descendant, managed to bring the business back into the family in 1990 from
communist state control. He began to market the piano again, and opened a
workshop to recondition second-hand instruments.
'It is difficult, but we are surviving, and we are regaining our traditional
niche in the upper end of the market,' said Ms Gitta Grosse, manager of
Bluthner's showrooms in Leipzig. 'You must remember that we had no chance to
compete, or gain access to high-quality parts for our piano under the old
system. This has all changed,' she added.
'The quality of Bluthner is much better now,' said Mr Willson. 'It has that
lovely soft tone.' Zimmermann, which caters for the middle end of the
market, has also regained its reputation as a high-quality family piano. But
its fortunes depend on the fate of Bechstein.
'If Bechstein is allowed to fail, it would be very sad. We are talking about
quality, about a name, about craftsmanship, which Germany is so good at, and
which people still want. The Bechstein is as famous as Berlin's coat of
arms, the bear,' said Mr Willson.
Steinway's Mr Glazebrook added: 'Some would think we would be delighted to
see the end of Bechstein because it would mean less competition. But it's
not like that at all. It's about retaining the continuity of quality and
tradition.'
The Senate, and any prospective rescuer, will next week have to decide the
price it will pay for maintaining, or neglecting, that tradition.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN BOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article on the future of the London orchestras (Arts, July
24/25) Sir Alan Peacock asserted derogatorily that 'many serious composers
of today are not primarily interested in winning over the public'.
But why should they be? Those composers whose works are most likely to stand
the test of time are by definition avant-garde in the sense that their
unique creativity extends musical boundaries beyond the previous experience
of the listening public.
The 20th century is notable (and notorious) for the number of major
compositions that did not win over the public when first performed, but
which have subsequently become standard works in the repertoire.
If the Arts Council lacks both historical perspective and vision and expects
all composers to be user-friendly and market-oriented it will stifle the
imperative originality from which great works spring.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Hatchet honed to a softer point: Robert Horton, former boss
of BP, is changing his abrasive image for the chairmanship of Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one thing worse than being spoken of unkindly, it is not being
spoken of at all. Anyone who doubts it should consider the case of Robert
Horton, the man who will take charge of Britain's 10,000-mile network of
railway tracks next April when rail privatisation starts coming into effect.
Barely a year ago, in one of the most sensational palace coups in recent UK
corporate history, Mr Horton was ousted from his position as chairman and
chief executive of British Petroleum with accusations of abrasiveness and
megalomania ringing in his ears.
Now, as chairman of Railtrack, the government-owned company that will take
over the tracks from British Rail next year, he is preparing to re-enter the
public arena in a job that will not only thrust him more than ever into
prominence, but threatens to turn him into an object of vilif-ication if he
fulfils people's worst fears about what he might do.
Mr Horton, 53, is a government appointee to the chairmanship of Railtrack.
That is bad enough for members of the rail lobby, since they mistrust
ministers' commitment to the railways. But far more disturbing is Mr
Horton's reputation as an axe man ('Horton the Hatchet', as the sobriquet
has it), for it recalls the swingeing cuts to the railway system instigated
by another Conservative government appointee in the 1960s - Dr Richard
(later Baron) Beeching, then-chairman of the British Railways Board.
Mr Horton's reputation for toughness was built up during a 35-year climb to
the top at BP. His record was that of an aggressive cost-cutter, first in
the tanker and chemical divisions and then as head of BP's North American
operations.
Mr Horton's determination and boundless ambition went down well in the US,
where they satisfied notions of what captains of industry should be. But his
American-style management methods were less well received in the UK when Mr
Horton became chairman and chief executive in 1990.
He made it his mission to shake up a corporate culture stultified by
bureaucracy. Head office committees were abolished, layers of management
were swept away, and thousands of jobs went. Responsibility was delegated to
unit managers, who were told that they would 'own' problems and be
'empowered' to deal with them.
Unfortunately the changes coincided with adverse economic conditions which
caused a sharp fall in profits. Worse, Mr Horton generated personal
antagonism with his reputation for arrogance. 'Because I am blessed by my
good brain, I tend to get to the right answer rather quicker and more often
than most people,' he said in a notorious interview with Forbes, the
American business magazine.
In June last year, his fellow directors decided they could no longer work
with him and cast him out. But Mr Horton was not to stay out of the
limelight for long. As chairman of Railtrack, he may have exchanged the
Pounds 787,000 he earned in his last year at BP for a more modest annual
salary of Pounds 120,000; he may have left BP's palatial City headquarters
for a dowdy, down-at-heel office block opposite Russell Square tube station;
but he is back.
He is also at pains to soften the harder edges of his image. Whatever else
he may have been brought into Railtrack to do, he says, it is not to take an
axe to the railway network. 'It is very different from the situation I found
in the oil industry, because BP had diversified into a lot of businesses
that were not core, such as minerals and animal feed,' he says.
'It seemed to me that an oil company ought to stick to being an oil and
petrochemicals company. But railways are quite different: railways are a
core activity in themselves, and I have absolutely no intention of being a
Dr Beeching mark two.'
Rather, he says, his goals are to improve the quality of the existing
infrastructure and to increase capacity by installing better signalling
systems and removing bottlenecks. 'I believe in the efficiency of public
transport, and far from wanting to reduce what is available, I want railways
to become a more popular and more used mode of travel.'
If this sounds slightly suspect coming from someone whose previous business
was making petrol for cars, Mr Horton is ready to acknowledge it. 'Obviously
with my background, I start from the point of view that the car is a great
liberator for people who, 40 years ago, would not have travelled beyond the
town they lived in,' he says.
'But we are faced with a situation in which this cannot continue in an
unfettered way because we live in a little island with a lot of people and a
lot of beautiful countryside, and we don't want to see it turned into a
concrete jungle.'
The implication of that, says Mr Horton, is that motorists will sooner or
later have to start paying more for the use of the roads, so encouraging a
switch to rail for goods and passenger transport.
So is Mr Horton the railwayman's friend? It would seem so. One difficulty he
cannot gloss over, however, is how he will fund the track improvements he
wants at a time when the prospects of getting more money out of the
government are close to zero.
An easy solution would be to raise the money from the train operators by
inflicting high charges for the use of the tracks. But that is not Mr
Horton's plan - nor, presumably, the government's - for it would mean either
large and politically unacceptable fare increases or bigger state subsidies
for the train operators.
Instead, the money will have to come from efficiency gains within
Railtrack's operations. And this, above all, is why Horton the Hatchet has
been drafted into the railways - to take an axe to Railtrack's costs, so
easing fears among would-be train operators that their track charges will be
dictated by a lazy, inefficient monopoly.
Railtrack will be a lean machine, says Mr Horton. Its headquarters will
employ about 150 people, half from BR and half from the private sector. The
company will also take on BR's signalling and train control staff, taking
employee numbers to 10,000-12,000. But everything else - track maintenance,
signalling renewal, engineering work and the rest - will be contracted out,
with BR's existing staff competing with the private sector for the work.
Job losses are potentially large: BR employs 40,000 people on track
maintenance and engineering. But Mr Horton is politician enough to duck the
question of exactly how many will go: 'I am not going to say - that's just
asking for trouble.'
The other big change will be the creation of 10 geographical zones to run
Railtrack's day-to-day operations. Managers will be given a high degree of
devolved power to run their businesses, Mr Horton says. Headquarters will
set quarterly targets and zonal managers will be left to achieve them, with
financial rewards geared to the degree of success.
If this begins to sound like the 'empowerment' which Mr Horton so strongly
advocated in the past, he is not about to disagree. 'I have not fallen in
love with committees since I left BP,' he says. Nor does it sound as though
he is planning any drastic changes in his management style.
If you lead from the front and take difficult decisions, people will say you
are arrogant and abrasive, which I don't think I am,' he says.
'I think my management style is actually highly consultative - I really do
delegate. But I believe in active leadership and not ducking leadership, and
in a complicated business there is limited scope for endless debate.'
Even so, the bruising circumstances of Mr Horton's exit from BP have left
some scars. He speaks bitterly of the events leading up to his departure: 'I
had over 30 very happy and stimulating years in the oil industry. It was
hardly my fault that the deepest recession for 30 years was under way.'
Is this then a new, softer, gentler Bob Horton taking charge of Britain's
railway infrastructure?
'Possibly,' he says. 'Possibly. I am very conscious of the fact that I have
a lot of learning left to do. Mind you, so has everyone. We are at a new
dawn now.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Handbagged by grey power: Can Major rebound after the
humiliation of Christchurch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bloody nose in Newbury. A kick in the teeth in Christchurch. Mr John Major
cannot take much more of it before he crashes to the canvas.
After the loss of Newbury in May, the prime minister sacked his chancellor.
The ghost of Mr Norman Lamont lives on. If there was a single factor which
ensured the government would be humiliated in Christchurch, it was the
decision in his last Budget to impose VAT on domestic fuel.
But the Christchurch result said much more about Mr Major's administration -
and his premiership. The government and its leader have fallen out with
their own people. The footsoldiers of Toryism in southern England are
seething. Unless he wins them back, the prime minister is doomed.
The by-election result was as awful as the government's worst fears. By the
final days of the campaign, ministers had given up any hope of holding what
only a year ago was their 15th safest seat.
In the event, the 16,427 majority secured by Mrs Diana Maddock, the
less-than-inspiring Liberal Democrat candidate, broke all postwar records.
No Conservative government since 1945 has seen a 35 per cent swing against
it. Nor has any previous administration witnessed such a dramatic fall in
its own vote.
The traditional refuge after Tory by-election disasters - blaming the local
activists' dud candidate - is not on offer this week. Mr Rob Hayward, an
experienced former MP, made his mistakes. But those on the ground judged
that, on balance, he won rather than lost votes.
Mr Major's reaction was predictable. Christchurch marked the end of a
wretched year for his government. But it was backward- not forward-looking.
The electors were responding to the economic recession and to the disarray
caused by the Tory civil war over Europe.
He could draw comfort from Labour's dismal performance. Mr John Smith may
claim that his party's lost deposit in Christchurch was the inevitable
result of tactical voting. But the outcome - coupled with a similar
humiliation in Newbury - can hardly enhance Labour's pretension to be a
party which can again win seats across the south of England. Mr Smith,
embroiled in his own, damaging, internal dispute with the trade unions,
cannot rely on the government's mistakes to deliver votes to his party.
The long summer parliamentary recess offers Mr Major a respite. The
Conservative party at Westminster has been denied its opportunity to panic.
The turmoil in European currency markets has raised a question mark over
prospects for the economy, but the odds are that the British upturn will
continue to take hold. Another interest rate cut might sweeten the October
party conference. Maastricht is history.
Wise souls on the Tory backbenches believe time will prove the commentators
wrong: those who follow events at Westminster have made the classic mistake
of projecting into the future the mood of the recent past.
Mr John Biffen, the eloquent elder statesman of the liberal Tory right, left
for his summer break this week predicting the 'black misery' of Christchurch
would be followed by much calmer autumn waters. As economic recovery began
to be felt by the voters, Mr Major would have another chance to get to grips
with his domestic policy agenda.
But drawing lines under past disasters has become quite a habit for this
government - under its forced exit from the exchange rate mechanism, under
coal industry closures, under turmoil in the schools, under Norman Lamont.
The lines rarely seem to last.
For all the brave ministerial speeches yesterday, the cabinet looks tired
and purposeless. Mr Major does not look prime ministerial; the voters judge
him weak. He has still to articulate a convincing political agenda.
Mr Michael Heseltine's energy is sorely missed. Mr John Patten has been
sidelined by a stress-related stomach illness. Others around the cabinet
table are preoccupied with survival, not buzzing with ideas.
Mr Kenneth Clarke is an exception. But Christchurch has narrowed greatly the
options for what must be a tough November Budget. Senior Whitehall officials
predict he will resist the pressure from the Tory backbenches to delay the
introduction of VAT on fuel. It was not his policy but he has defended it
vigorously.
But the voters have delivered a warning that they will not tolerate further
tax or spending changes which fall heavily on the government's supporters.
Grey power has come of age in suburban England.
The chancellor might as well rule out now any further extension of VAT
beyond, perhaps, to newspapers. There will have to be generous compensation
to offset the pain of higher fuel costs. Every proposed saving in welfare
benefits and health service provision will now have to be weighed against
the reaction of the once-loyal battalions of home counties pensioners now
marching under Mr Paddy Ashdown's banner.
The Liberal Democrat leader was wise yesterday not to draw extravagant
conclusions from the party's recent undoubted successes. There was too much
talk in the 1980s of 'breaking the mould'. Mr Ashdown's troops remain
preoccupied with local rather than national politics. The team which Mrs
Maddock will join at Westminster is hardly full of sparkling talent.
Mr Ashdown has yet to establish a coherent national strategy for his party
but he is capitalising - like Mr Ross Perot in the US last year - on the
mood of anti-politics which has swept through the west.
Taken together, Newbury, the county council elections on the same day, and
Christchurch, have seen the Liberal Democrats advance steadily eastwards
from their West Country strongholds. The party is beginning to entrench in
areas which the Conservatives have long taken for granted.
Up to two dozen Tory MPs are now looking anxiously over their shoulders at
the threat to their seats come the general election. They are warning the
prime minister that it will take more than a gentle economic recovery to
erase the bitterness cause by the 'betrayals' of the past year. They are
reminding him that they represent the difference between Conservative and
Labour government. If he does not pay heed, they will join the disenchanted
and dispossessed on the Tory backbenches who have already given up on Mr
Major's leadership.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Pragmatism v dogmatism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTERED AND drowsy, the European exchange rate mechanism looks to be on its
last legs. Miraculous recoveries have been known before. But unless Europe's
finance ministers are able to hatch a plan over this weekend which can
promise to deliver a sizeable cut in French interest rates very soon, the
prospects for fixed exchange rates surviving in Europe, other than among a
small core of Germany's north European partners, look slim. What is needed
is a pragmatic and face-saving escape route for the French government which
can deliver lower rates without requiring the abandonment of its European
ambitions and commitments. It is in Bonn, more than Frankfurt and even
Paris, that the hard thinking must take place.
Germany's political leaders, rudely awakened in their holiday retreats, must
put past errors and disagreements behind them. Yes, Bundesbank council
members can rightly complain that it is the German government's budget
profligacy that has required them to keep interest rates so high. Yes,
German government ministers can mutter that France should not have resisted
a upward realignment of the D-Mark when it still made sense.
Nor are French remonstrations about the Bundesbank's lamentable performance
over the past week likely to help in the search for a route out of the
current crisis. Reasonable people can disagree about whether
recession-troubled Germany really does face a short-term inflationary
threat. But it was perfectly within the Bundesbank council's rights to
resist a cut in its discount rate if it truly believed that such a cut would
run counter to its declared aim of securing medium-term price stability in
Germany.
But the French can complain about the Bundesbank's failure to quell the
widespread rumour before Thursday's council meeting that a discount rate cut
was imminent. Indeed, by cutting the repo rate almost to the discount rate
floor on Wednesday, the bank actively fed those rumours.
Ruled out
Still, the substance, not the style, of the Bundesbank's decision was what
set off yesterday's turmoil on the foreign exchanges. For the Bundesbank has
effectively ruled out a cut in interest rates in the ERM, as currently
constituted for some weeks. This realisation was enough to undermine
confidence in the ability of Belgium, Denmark and, most important, France to
live with the high real interest rates that Germany's fiscal difficulties
are transmitting across Europe. Intervention, on an unprecedented scale in
Europe's monetary history, could not keep the French franc from falling out
of its ERM bands.
The future of Franco-German monetary relations has thus reached a crucial
juncture. The time has now passed when public statements of commitment to
current parities from the French minsters can do much good. Regardless of
the hopes and wishes of the French government, the markets do not now appear
to believe that France can maintain interest rates at their current levels.
The gap between the market rates and prime rates is too large, the banking
system too weak, the French economy too troubled and the erosion of public
support for the franc fort policy, in the face of rising unemployment, too
rapid. Any effort to sweat next week out will probably end in failure.
Economic reality
Nor is a realignment, or modest widening of bands, likely to buy anything
more than a fleeting breathing space. France, Belgium and Denmark are not
burdened by uncompetitive exchange rates, but by much higher interest rates
than their excellent inflation performances require. A realignment cannot
work unless it persuades the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates. But
Germany's inflationary pressures are in the service sector, where the impact
of a higher exchange rate is negligible. In the private sector, where a
stronger D-Mark would bite, deflation is currently the problem.
The only other alternative, short of a rapid and politically improbable move
to monetary union, is temporarily to sever the Franco-German monetary link.
France can no longer afford to ignore the economic reality that Germany's
particular problems demand a tighter monetary policy than France can
sustain.
What is needed is a way to break the link in a manner consistent with the
French government's political pledges: to stay in the ERM and to honour the
spirit of the Maastricht treaty. The solution is for the German government
to propose what now seems economically rational, if politically very
difficult: the temporary departure of the D-Mark from the ERM. The remaining
ERM member countries should then announce an immediate 2 percentage point
cut in interest rates, perhaps accompanied by a move to narrower bands.
France may blanche at such an outcome. But, by choosing pragmatism, both
Paris and Bonn would signal a partial but honourable retreat from their
joint monetary aspirations. Trying to soldier on looks increasingly likely
to deliver an inferior outcome, and in a much more ignominious fashion.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Fixer who may come unstuck - Dan
Rostenkowski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the best of times and the worst of times for Mr Dan Rostenkowski.
The burly Chicago Democrat has been in his element, bullying and cajoling
his congressional colleagues towards a deal on President Bill Clinton's
budget. As chairman of the Ways and Means committee of the House of
Representatives, Mr Rostenkowski is, as always, central to tax negotiations.
But he remains the target of a two-year criminal investigation by federal
prosecutors who have requisitioned a dozen years of his cheques, bills and
campaign documents, and subpoenaed his staff, his friends and his daughters.
Last week, Mr Robert Rota, the former House of Representatives postmaster,
pleaded guilty to three misdemeanour charges, including aiding 'Congressman
A' to embezzle at least Dollars 21,300 between 1985 and 1991 by giving him
cash in exchange for office expense vouchers made out for stamp purchases.
The amounts and dates of the vouchers filed with the court match those
listed in separate House records for Mr Rostenkowski.
Mr Rostenkowski last week reaffirmed that he was 'innocent of any
wrongdoing', and no charges of any kind have been filed against him.
But Mr Rota's plea has made many in Mr Rostenkowski's two home cities of
Washington and Chicago conclude that it is only a matter of time before he
faces indictment, and with it, under Democratic Party rules, removal from
the Ways and Means chairmanship.
His critics have often dismissed him as a typical Chicago machine
politician, and indeed, like his mentor, Mayor Richard Daley, who brought
the system of patronage and political favours to perfection in his rule over
the city from 1955 until his death in 1976, he has always known the
importance of getting his supporters' streets swept and finding jobs for
their nephews.
In his 20s, when trying to make it as a professional baseball player, he
trimmed his name to Rosten, but regained the -kowski when he entered
politics, aged 24, following in his father's footsteps as a member of the
Illinois state legislature.
He still lives in the house where he was born,in a Polish-American community
on Chicago's north-west side, and keeps only a sparse, one-bedroom flat in
Washington. His wife, LaVerne, does not come to Washington.
He still delivers for Chicago, winning the city regular federal money for
roads, transit systems and public housing.
Mr Rostenkowski is also defiantly old school in his way of doing business,
which involves a mastery of the art of compromise, backed up by endless
loyalty and considerable courage. meaning what precise
He is unmatched in his ability to read the mood of the House, to sense the
exact combination of concessions and bullying that will be needed to strike
a deal.
His legislative monument is probably the 1986 tax reform, which lowered
income tax rates in exchange for the elimination of a host of deductions and
loopholes.
The measure never commanded much popular support, but Mr Rostenkowski
manoeuvred it through a reluctant House making concessions only to members
who would promise to back the bill.
It finally put paid to Mr Rostenkowski's earlier reputation for political
laziness ' for being quick to shoot down a bill that he judged would not
pass the House, but slower to do the hard work needed to get tough measures
into law.
As chairman he demands the same from members of his Ways and Means
committee, which has jurisdiction over almost all the revenue legislation
and almost half of the spending that passes through Congress.
He has little patience for the Senate, whose convoluted procedural rules he
finds impede the constructive work of legislation, and none at all for
senators who retire in frustration.
'You don't quit. You fix the machinery,' he says.
He has no time at all for members of Congress who condone public criticism
of their institution, reserving particular scorn for those who seek to curb
their own pay.
'Sure there are perquisites that come with the job. But you know as well as
I do that perks can't make up for the birthdays, ballgames, holidays and
meals that we miss,' he says.
Making no secret of his belief that he is worth a great deal more than his
congressional salary of Dollars 133,600 a year, Mr Rostenkowski lives a
lifestyle that systematically exploits these perks.
Travel, often to golfing events, is paid for by business and lobbying
groups; and meals by Mr Rostenkowski's campaign fund or his political action
committee, which raises money to support other candidates.
Blurred lines between political and social activities are not unusual in
Congress.
But few can match the chairman of Ways and Means in his ability to reap the
rewards of office.
Indeed, Mr Rostenkowski's skill at stretching his perks to the limit is the
reason why many colleagues find it hard to believe that he would have gone
beyond those limits. Why would he embezzle small change from the House post
office when he could legally have pocketed more than Dollars 1m from his
campaign fund if he had retired last year, under a law which left
longserving members of Congress subject to older, looser campaign finance
rules.
The question hangs unspoken over the conference room in which House
negotiators, led by Mr Rostenkowski, argue with their Senate counterparts
over a compromise budget bill and complaining about the 'do-nothing'
Senate's inability to pass anything with even the slightest grain of
controversy.
For all the reformism of the last 20 years, in which clean politics has come
to outweigh good policy with US public opinion, it has often seemed over the
last week of negotiations that Mr Rostenkowski's old school arm-twisting
skills were as much in demand as ever.
The budget agreed by the Democrats yesterday, however, marks a victory for
the 'do-nothing' Senate and a failure for Mr Rostenkowski. It may also sound
the knell for a politician from another era.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Fuel for thought on VAT: A Tory party memo has found its way
to John Willman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor,
I thought you might welcome a memorandum setting out the policy options over
the extension of VAT to domestic fuel and power, widely blamed for our
humiliation in the Christchurch by-election.
I assume that you do not wish to withdraw the extension - popular though
this would be. VAT on domestic fuel at 8 1/2 per cent in 1994 will raise
almost Pounds 1bn; the second-stage increase to 17 1/2 per cent in 1995 will
raise Pounds 2.3bn a year thereafter. Unless you put up other taxes to raise
similar amounts, the markets would see this as a fatal weakening in your
resolve to curb government borrowing. The Treasury gilts people would have a
fit.
I read in the press that you thought about going ahead with the first-stage
rise to 8 1/2 per cent in 1994, but scrapping the second-stage increase. The
same newspapers say that the deficit would be made up by extending VAT to
other zero-rated items such as food and children's clothes. I assume this
bizarre suggestion was designed to frighten backbenchers away from scrapping
VAT on domestic fuel.
If you are going ahead with VAT on domestic fuel, quick action is needed to
substantiate your predecessor's pledge to 'help people on low incomes'.
There is good news and bad news, chancellor.
The good news is that you can help most people on low incomes - though it
will swallow up about a third of the additional rev-enue from the rise in
VAT.
The bad news is that you can't help everybody. Worse, you can only
compensate people for average rises in fuel bills. People with
higher-than-average bills will get less than they need and will still feel
aggrieved. People who get more than they need are unlikely to draw attention
to this.
I understand that Peter Lilley (social security secretary) is anxious to
announce a package at the party conference in October. Here are some points
to think about:
Don't make the mistake Mr Portillo (chief secretary to the Treasury) made of
saying compensation for higher fuel prices can be left to the annual
uprating of social security benefits in line with the retail prices index.
First, uprating is retroactive - so pensioners, the disabled and low-income
families would get a benefits increase only after a year of paying higher
fuel bills. Second, most people know the poorest households spend a
higher-than-average proportion of their income on keeping warm and need more
than average compensation.
Paying an extra 80p a week to people on means-tested benefits from next
April would compensate them for VAT at 8 per cent on the average fuel bill
of the poorest 20 per cent of households, according to our Social Security
Advisory Committee. That means finding about Pounds 360m next year and
Pounds 720m a year from 1995 when the second-stage increase is imposed. This
looks cheap at the price.
We need some way of dealing with the criticism that the fuel price increases
will also hit many pensioners just above the income level for means-tested
benefits. I suggest we put a decent sum - say Pounds 100m  - into a scheme
to provide them with home insulation grants. This would also bolster our
green justification of the VAT increase.
Politically, the cost of this package, more than Pounds 800m when the full
VAT increase is imposed, is a small price to pay. You could always cover the
cost by imposing VAT on newspapers which would raise more than Pounds 1bn
and teach the treacherous tabloids a lesson.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Court rejects Rees-Mogg Maastricht claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD REES-MOGG yesterday lost his High Court attempt to block ratification
of the Maastricht treaty.
In a short and precise judgment the court rejected his claim that the
government was acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without
parliamentary approval.
Lord Justice Lloyd said that the court did not doubt the issues were 'of
great moment' but it was 'an exaggeration to describe it as the most
important constitutional case for 300 years'.
The former editor of The Times was not in court to hear the decision. His
son Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg said that his father had been unable to break a
long-standing engagement in Switzerland.
He said that his father and his financial backers, who include the
international financier Sir James Goldsmith, would consider the judgment in
detail before deciding whether to appeal.
Mr Rees-Mogg denied that by bringing the action his father was merely making
political mischief. 'It's been done as an important constitutional issue.
There's no question of my father doing it merely to cause trouble, none at
all.'
Lord Rees-Mogg was ordered to pay the government's legal costs. Mr Rees-Mogg
said he did not know how expensive the legal challenge had been, but added,
'it's not cheap'.
Giving the court's judgment, Lord Justice Lloyd, sitting with Lord Justice
Mann and Mr Justice Auld, said Lord Rees-Mogg had advanced three arguments.
First, by ratifying the social protocol the government intended to increase
the powers of the European parliament without parliamentary approval as
required by the 1978 European Parliamentary Elections Act.
Second, by ratifying the social protocol the government would be altering
the content of EC law without parliamentary approval.
Finally, by ratifying Title V of the Maastricht treaty, which deals with a
common foreign and security policy, the government would be transferring
part of the royal prerogative to the European Council without statutory
authority.
The judge said that the first argument failed because section 1(2) of the
1993 European Communities (Amendment) Act contained a clear and unambiguous
approval by parliament of the Maastricht treaty as a whole, including all
the protocols.
The protocols were ancillary or incidental to the Maastricht treaty and
ratification of the treaty would automatically involve ratification of the
protocols.
On the second issue, Mr David Pannick QC, for Lord Rees-Mogg, had argued
that by ratifying the social protocol the government would be altering
community law under the Treaty of Rome, which was now the fundamental law of
the UK, and parliament alone could change UK law.
Although the UK had opted out of the social chapter, the government had
agreed to authorise the other 11 member states to effect it through EC
institutions - and that could have an indirect effect on UK domestic law, Mr
Pannick said.
But the judge said that a possible indirect effect on domestic law was 'far
too slender a basis on which to hold that parliament has impliedly excluded
or curtailed the crown's prerogative to alter or add to the Treaty of Rome'.
Lord Justice Lloyd said the third argument was 'the most interesting; but
also the weakest'.
Because Title V was an inter-governmental agreement it was possible for the
court simply to accept that since no question of domestic law was involved
it had no jurisdiction to consider the matter.
But assuming the issue was justiciable, even if Title V was read 'with an
eye most favourable to Mr Pannick's argument, it cannot be regarded as a
transfer of prerogative powers,' he said.
Title V did not entail an abandonment or transfer of prerogative powers; but
an exercise of those powers, he added. It should be read in the same light
as the UN and Nato charters.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Generators could face curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's TWO largest electricity generators could be subjected to price
controls or be asked to sell plant after Professor Stephen Littlechild,
industry regulator, completes a review of their costs and profit margins
later this year.
Prof Littlechild raised these possibilities yesterday as he announced the
results of a preliminary inquiry into why selling prices in the wholesale
electricity pool have risen by 20 per cent this year.
He indicated these could be alternatives to referring National Power and
PowerGen to the Monopolies Commission if he found that they had increased
the prices they charge to the electricity wholesale pool excessively.
They would be preferable to profit controls, he said.
Prof Littlechild said the many electricity customers who had complained
about the pool price rises were right to be concerned.
'In a competitive market, customers' interests would be paramount. This is
not yet the case in the electricity market.'
The generators received average pool revenues which exceeded their avoidable
costs. 'The need to cover avoidable costs does not justify any further price
increases. Nor did it justify an increase as high as the recent one (since
April).
'Customers assert that prices would be lower in a more competitive market.
The generators could counter these assertions by competing more aggressively
on the pool price.' Prof Littlechild said the electricity pool should base
prices on both demand and supply. One suggestion is that demand side bidding
be introduced, whereby consumers could be paid if they agreed to stop taking
electricity when prices rose to a certain level.
The regulator said that the pool should also look closely at rules under
which generators are compensated if plant is constrained off the system by
the National Grid, which operates it. Prof Littlechild is also asking the
pool and the National Grid to consider a 'more appropriate division of
responsibilities' for transmission and administration costs.
Many of the costs were simply passed on to the customer. They could be met
by the grid taking wider responsibility and recovering money through
charges.
Existing arrangements did not provide enough incentive to cut costs, he
said.
Alternatively some of the costs could be dealt with by the pool rather than
the grid.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Court refuses to lift BCCI freeze
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday refused to lift orders for the unlimited worldwide
freezing of assets granted to the liquidators of BCCI in support of their
Dollars 10.5bn (Pounds 7bn) claim against Sheikh Khalid Salem Bin Mahfouz
and Mr Haroon Rashid Khalon, a retired banker.
The orders were originally granted in December and make provision for
payment of legal costs and living expenses of Dollars 10,000 a week each.
Their continuation had been contested by Sheikh Khalid and Mr Khalon.
Mr Justice Rattee also refused an application by Sheikh Khalid to limit the
order against him to Dollars 1.5bn.
He said he did not accept any of the objections put forward on behalf of
Sheikh Khalid or Mr Khalon and continued the injunctions until the
liquidators' claim comes to trial.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Lloyd's loss review attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN MERRETT, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, the insurance
market, yesterday criticised a Lloyd's review into losses by one of his
syndicates, Richard Lapper writes.
The review was started in 1991 when losses from 1983, left open because of
uncertainty about the eventual cost of claims, exceeded Pounds 19.6m.
Syndicate 421, one of a number managed by Merrett Holdings, specialised in
so-called long-tail business in which claims can occur many years after the
policies' inception.
Mr Merrett said in a letter to the 341 Names - individuals whose assets
support the market: 'In our opinion the report produces virtually nothing
that could be thought to be new and relevant information.' The Names face
losses of Pounds 57,000 for each Pounds 10,000 traded.
The review focused on the underwriting of seven run-off contracts, which
generated most of the loss.
Losses on the contracts, which reinsured other syndicates and insurance
companies, initially arose from US asbestosis claims.
The review says that 'the risks assumed resulted in Syndicate 421 having a
substantial exposure to potential adverse developments on old years of
account in respect of much older and larger syndicates, an effective
concentration of risk into a new and small syndicate'.
Mr Merrett said the review should have looked more specifically into the
circumstances surrounding the deterioration of results in 1990, when claims
from environmental pollution accounted for almost 90 per cent of a cash call
for Pounds 5.6m.
The Court of Appeal yesterday ruled that Lloyd's Names unable to pay their
losses can sue their agents for negligence.
Names originally won the case in the High Court in May.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Voting swings and roundabouts hit Tories: David Butler
analyses the result and concludes that while the government has no excuse
for the dramatic loss, time will ease the burdens of defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTCHURCH was not quite the record-breaking result that some have
suggested.
The 31 per cent drop in the Conservative share of the vote far exceeds their
worst performances in the Thatcher-Major era - 24 per cent in Richmond in
1989 and 23 in Ribble Valley in 1991 - but it was topped by the 32 per cent
Tory slump in Rochdale in 1958 and Labour's drop of 38 per cent in
Bermondsey in 1982.
The Conservatives have been quick to find comfort in history. Their worst
by-election disaster in each of their last four parliaments in office were
reversed in the subsequent general election.
But the Conservatives have no excuses. Nothing in the constituency or the
candidate or the campaign was especially adverse, they suffered from the
greatest anti-government swing on record because the government is
unpopular. The public has, at least temporarily, lost confidence in the
Conservatives' ability to govern.
The Liberal Democrats have learned the art of not boasting during a
by-election campaign and even their stupendous triumph is being downplayed.
Victory has too often been followed by disappointment.
But the triumphs of Newbury and Christchurch will enable the party to
recruit money and candidates in a way that will add to their credibility
when they come to try to pick up a few seats in the Euro-elections next
June. Although they are the largest Liberal party in the Community, the
first-past-the-post electoral system has denied them representation at
Strasbourg.
For Labour to find comfort it must look to its nationwide poll standing  -
44 per cent, 17 points ahead of the Tories and 19 points ahead of the
Liberal Democrats.
In Newbury, its vote fell from 6 per cent to 2 per cent. In Christchurch the
fall was proportionately greater from 12 per cent to 6 per cent.
Labour had prudently hinted in advance that its supporters were welcome to
be beastly to the Tories in any way they saw fit - a tacit encouragement to
the tactical voting that has become increasingly prevalent.
But tactical voting does not work symmetrically. Most Labour voters prefer
Liberal Democrats to the Tories.
The Liberal Democrats are more evenly divided. There are few seats where
tactical vot-ing greatly helps Labour.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, cannot countenance a formal
pact with Labour just because it would drive so many of his supporters into
the arms of the Conservatives.
One feature of government by-election disasters is that the record swings
have always been to the centre, not to the main opposition party.
Although the Christchurch swing would oust the Conservatives in every seat,
the movement would surely be much less in seats where Labour was the
challenger.
This year the Liberal Democrats have scored two huge victories in the safest
of Conservative seats.
No one expects places of this sort to fall in a general election. And
there's the rub for Mr Ashdown - it is in the safer Conservative seats that
his party fares best.
Liberal Democrat strength is not in the right places. If all three parties
won equal votes in the next election, Conservatives and Labour would each
get more than twice as many seats as the Liberal Democrats.
Thursday confirms the new law. No government seat can be held in a
by-election. No Tory MP can hope for a peerage or a plum job while this
parliament lasts and no seat could be found for Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong
governor, or any alternative saviour.
Mr John Major's Huntingdon, the safest of all Conservative seats, would have
been lost by 10,000 on the Christchurch swing.
The only vacancies will come from mortality. Actuarial calculations suggest
that six more Conservatives MPs are likely to perish before the next
dissolution. In the previous three parliaments death caused Tory vacancies
at the rate of two a year.
Six by-election losses would reduce the government's majority from 17 to
five - but, with luck, that would not happen until 1996.
Even the most sensational of by-election results creates but a small ripple
in the ocean of time. The impact of Christchurch will be deadened by the
summer recess.
When the politicians and commentators return from their holidays their eyes
will be on the party conferences.
Will the unions behave themselves for Labour? Will the Euro-sceptics behave
themselves for the Conservatives?
The government must hope for no more by-elections, but an economic recovery
may be slow and the lag between economic recovery and political recovery may
be considerable.
Mr Major and his party have a rough road ahead. But one can exaggerate how
much Christchurch adds to their burdens.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Ministers urge Tories to unite on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR MINISTERS yesterday began a concerted effort to unite the Tories
behind a strategy of sticking to their policies, after the Conservatives'
disastrous showing in the Christchurch by-election.
But there were warnings from some Tory backbenchers that the clear message
after the overthrow of what was a Conservative stronghold just 15 months ago
was that the government should change course.
Mr Paddy Ashdown said that his party's emphatic victory showed the Liberal
Democrats 'on a clear upward curve'.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, sought to shrug off the
party's lost deposit in the Dorset constituency. But other Labour MPs
expressed fears about the implications of the result for Labour in the south
of England.
The Tory fightback was led by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who
attacked the 'incoherence' of Liberal Democrat policies over the social
chapter, value added tax on fuel and the role of British forces in Bosnia.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, urged the party not to look
for people or policies to blame for the defeat, since it had already
suffered so much from appearing disunited. 'No one should write us off. We
will come fighting back, stronger than before,' she said.
Conservative MPs seemed inclined, however, to ignore her call not to seek
scapegoats, putting Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, and the imposition
of value added tax on domestic fuel clearly in the firing line.
There were also longer-term warnings about the position of Mr John Major
himself unless the party's fortunes improved.
Mr William Powell, MP for Corby, said that at the very least, ministers
should not go ahead with raising VAT on household fuel bills to 17.5 per
cent in 1995. Other Tories said it was a sign that taxes themselves were so
unpopular with erstwhile Tory voters that there should be cuts in public
spending rather than any tax increases in the November Budget.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, compared the prime minister with a
door-to-door salesman, telling BBC radio that in politics as in business,
'if people don't like what you're offering they will slam the door in your
face'.
Mr Ashdown hailed the Liberal Democrats' success as confirmation of voters'
determination to see better government in Britain, and said it was fresh
proof that in the 'heartlands of the south' only his party could beat the
Tories.
Mrs Beckett's insistence that across the south of England Labour was far
more often the challenger to the Conservatives than the Liberal Democrats,
was somewhat undermined by Mr Bryan Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham and a
former shadow cabinet member, who said the result had 'disturbing lessons'
for the party.
He said the party should recognise that it was still not identifying enough
with voters in the south and that it needed to develop policies they would
find 'meaningful and attractive'.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Local authorities may be given control of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS that could result in local authorities having a free hand in
setting pension benefits for their staff are being put forward for
consultation following an efficiency scrutiny by the Department of the
Environment, published yesterday.
The report suggests possible changes to the local government pension scheme
in England and Wales, some of which would require legislation. Only new
employees would be affected.
The proposals range from complete deregulation of pensions, with employers
specifically empowered to contribute to private pension plans, to building
new flexibilities into the present uniform system.
More than Pounds 33bn is invested in the Local Government Superannuation
Scheme, more than 10 per cent of the UK pension fund industry. There are
more than 2m actual or future beneficiaries - their arrangements are
prescribed by the government by regulation.
The scheme has traditionally been regarded as providing a 'Rolls-Royce'
standard of pension provision, says the report. Many observers believed that
the overall package 'probably remains just above average in relation to
salary for a pension scheme'.
The report says much had changed in recent years in local government - there
were fewer employees and more councils were opting out of national pay
scales.
It adds: 'The local government employment world has thus become more fluid
and diverse. Local authority pensions, however, remain monolithic and firmly
controlled from the centre.'

   CHRISTCHURCH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS DIANA MADDOCK, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, yesterday
rounded off her by-election victory by returning to the issue that has
always led her campaign - the government's proposal to impose value added
tax to heating fuel.
Speaking in an atmosphere of Liberal Democrat jubilation - albeit tempered
by the low-key political style that has marked Mrs Maddock's campaign - she
said the people of Christchurch had 'spoken for Britain'. She pledged that
VAT would be her first political battle on arrival in Westminster.
At her side Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said the by-election had
been a 'shout of rage' about the government's policies, and showed that the
Liberal Democrats were the main opposition to the government in the south of
England.
The Liberal Democrats said they had been taken aback by the size of their
victory. Mr Ashdown warned: 'It does not mean that we have got them (the
voters) for ever. I will not predict general elections from by-elections -
it's a mug's game.'
On the other side of town disappointed and exhausted Conservative party
workers insisted that they would regain the seat at the next election. But
Mr Rob Hayward, the Conservative candidate, conceded that the government
would have to re-examine some areas of policy if it is to prevent further
by-election defeats.
Speaking with the self-possession that has been the hallmark of his
campaign, he said he had lost 'because the voters of the constituency wanted
to register a determined protest'.
Away from the television cameras some local Conservatives suggested that Mr
Hayward's lack of local roots and the fact he is divorced had weakened him
in this highly traditional constituency.
His agent, Mrs Judith Jamieson, denied that Mr Hayward was becoming a
scapegoat, but admitted that the size of the swing had taken many aback.
But in spite of the political tremors that the by-election has sent to
Westminster, the mood on the streets of Christchurch yesterday remained  -
as always - restrained.
A few holidaymakers and shoppers politely applauded Mrs Maddock as she made
a triumphant tour in an open-topped bus, surrounded by a thicket of
television cameras.
But some of Mrs Maddock's constituents warned that she remained on
probation. Pensioner Mrs Lily Warner said: 'I voted for her this time
because I was fed up. But I don't know what I'll do next time. It all
depends on her.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Litigation against accountants rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG accountancy firms face mounting litigation from creditors and
investors seeking to recover losses from insolvent or troubled companies,
Lafferty, the business information group, says.
Lafferty says in a report to be published next week that the 'threat of
litigation has taken on new dimensions' in the US, with accountants held
responsible for much more than 'obvious malpractice'. A sharp fall in share
prices is sometimes enough to trigger a lawsuit against auditors.
In the 1992 financial year spending on litigation of the six leading US
accountancy firms amounted to 12 per cent of US accounting and auditing
revenues, compared with 9 per cent in 1991.
Lafferty says 1992 'will likely go down as the worst year ever for
litigation against accountants'.
Statistics in the report show that worldwide there have been 12 settlements
involving payouts of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) or more. Four of the cases
related to a Dollars 400m settlement by Ernst &amp; Young when it was sued by
three US government bodies for its role in the failure of US savings and
loans institutions. Ten of these cases were in the US but increasingly the
profession is under attack elsewhere in the world.
Three of the five lawsuits which sought to recover losses of more than
Dollars 1bn have been launched outside the US. These include a claim for
Dollars 8bn in damages by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young.
The report says that accountancy firms in at least 50 countries have
experienced one or more claims. Firms in at least 20 further countries may
have claims pending.
Although the level of liability in continental European countries is low,
the trend there is rising faster than in any other part of the world.
Last year, for example, French accountancy firms faced about 150 cases,
twice as many as in 1991.
The report says that if all proposed legislation and regulation in the
European Community is adopted, accountants practising in member states will
be subjected to the harshest rules anywhere that govern claims and
liability.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Court to review warehouse finding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COURT of Appeal yesterday allowed the UK's three biggest supermarket
chains to continue their attempt to block planning permission for a US-style
warehouse club - which would sell goods ranging from baked beans to car
tyres - at Thurrock, Essex.
Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco appealed after the High Court rejected their
application for a judicial review of Thurrock Borough Council's granting of
planning permission to Costco, the US warehouse club operator. The High
Court must now review the planning consent in early autumn.
Costco said it had spent 'several million pounds' on its site next to the
Lakeside shopping centre and the warehouse was less than four months from
completion.
The superstore chains are contesting Thurrock's decision to grant general
use approval for Costco's scheme, rather than classify it for retail use.
Thurrock says it believes Costco's business plan sets it apart from
conventional retailers, and has secured a legally-binding agreement from
Costco that it will not depart from that plan.
Warehouse clubs sell goods at bargain prices to members who pay an annual
fee.
Costco said they do not fit into any existing UK planning category.
But Mr John Littman, partner at planning consultants Rapleys, which is
advising the three superstore chains, said the clubs must be considered as
retailers.
'It is essential that warehouse clubs are subject to the same planning
controls as other major retailers if the planning system is to operate
consistently and effectively in the public interest,' he said.
Since the High Court hearing in June the Department of the Environment has
published a planning policy guidance note which says that warehouse clubs
should be considered retailers for planning purposes. But Thurrock said
yesterday it was 'very happy' with its decision. 'We are quite confident the
High Court will support our original judgment, because it was based on very
sound reasoning,' the council said.
Just how seriously the retailers are taking the matter is demonstrated by
their unprecedented decision to launch joint legal action. They have
appointed a public relations agency to handle the issue.
Mr Paul Moulton, managing director of Costco, said he had 'not been in the
UK long enough to judge whether the big three are typically this altruistic
in their protection of the planning laws. It seems suspicious to me'.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Crime fear of small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL businesses run a greater risk of becoming a target for crime than
individuals or homes, a Home Office study of crime prevention schemes has
shown, Charles Batchelor writes.
The study found that 40 per cent of burglary victims suffered a second
burglary within 12 months, and 48 per cent of 're-burgled' businesses
suffered a third burglary.
Up to two thirds of owners of small businesses were 'worried or very
worried' about becoming victims of crime.
The study recommends a seven-point plan for crime prevention. This includes
closer co-operation between businesses in High Street Watch schemes, and
better collection of data to identify patterns of crime against small
business.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Major sets date to testify at Iraq arms probe: Lord Justice
Scott tells Jimmy Burns which present and former ministers he would like to
give evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is to give evidence in public to the
inquiry into arms exports to Iraq on January 17, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Major released a copy of a letter sent yesterday in reply to one sent to
him on July 14 by Sir Richard Scott, the Appeal Court judge, who is
presiding over the inquiry, inviting him to appear as witness in the week
beginning December 13.
The change of date was agreed to fit in with Mr Major's other December
engagements.
The prime minister is expected to be questioned about the extent to which he
knew about crucial Whitehall decisions relating to arms exports while he was
foreign secretary and later as chancellor.
In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday - his first since he was
chosen to lead the inquiry last December - Sir Richard outlined a list of
present and former ministers he wants to give evidence before Christmas.
They include: Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister; former foreign
office ministers Mr Timothy Renton, Lord Howe, Mr William Waldegrave, Mr
Douglas Hurd, Mr David Mellor and Mr Tristan Garel-Jones; former trade
ministers Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Alan Clark; and Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary.
The judge has not ruled out taking evidence from two former heads of the
Ministry of Defence's defence exports sales organisation - Sir James Blyth,
now chief executive of Boots, and Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of
Vickers. He is yet to take a decision on Sir John Cuckney, who was chairman
of International Military Services, the government-owned defence sales
company, between 1974-85.
Sir Richard has asked for additional documents - believed to include CIA
material - from the Gonzalez Congressional banking committee in the US,
which has been looking at the financing of an alleged covert Iraqi
procurement network in the 1980s.
Sir Richard said the inquiry had taken longer than he had expected and
described it as looking 'into a very murky and inaccurate crystal ball'  -
the world of arms trading and the machinery of Whitehall. He now planned to
have his report completed by the end of March, not by Christmas as
originally thought.
In his letter to Mr Major, Sir Richard said delays in obtaining some
government documents had 'hindered the efficiency of the questioning of
witnesses'.
But he emphasised: 'I have not had any impression of any deliberate attempts
to withhold information, no civil servants or ministers have dragged their
feet about appearing as witnesses.
'As to the answering of questions by witnesses, some witnesses have been
forthcoming and extrovert in the way they answer questions and some have
not. One knows that as a judge from witness-box appearances. At the end of
the day, one has to consider the evidence as a whole and make one's mind up
as to what to make of it.'
Sir Richard will use the inquiry's summer recess to begin writing his
introduction to the report and to sift through additional documents.
He said it was too early to be drawn on the report's conclusions and warned
against exaggerated expectations concerning its potential political
fall-out. 'I do not see myself as holding a gun pointing at the heart of
government.'
Sir Richard said he did not think his terms of reference include proposals
for anti-secrecy laws such as a freedom of information act or rules on
public immunity certificates, which are used by the government to restrict
access to confidential documents.
'I find it quite unlikely that I am going to be recommending any sort of
legislation on (public immunity) . . . because I think it is essentially the
sort of area that ought to be left to be developed flexibly,' he said.
But he indicated that the evidence he had heard pointed to the need for
reform of exports and licensing procedures and a conclusion which could act
as an incentive for ministers and civil servants to govern more openly in
future.
One of the main reasons for the delay in the inquiry's proceedings had been
his discovery that companies may have been been getting round legal
restrictions on arms exports to Iraq by obtaining 'open licences' to export
to other Middle East countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which are
not subject to the stricter licensing regime and can be used as diversionary
routes. He was only now beginning to get the documentation on open licensing
contracts from government departments.
'I do not know how far the implications of this extend, but this is plainly
an area which could quite possibly have been used for a number of exports to
Iraq, without any breach of statutory export regulations.'
Sir Richard rejected the argument that his report should not consider
matters of ethics and public accountability in the government's handling of
its export policy to Iraq.
'I think government should be prepared to share with the public, on whose
behalf they govern, its concerns and aims and the reasons why important
decisions are taken.
'I know, that in many cases that is not practical for reasons of security
and other overriding national interest that may from time to time arise, but
as a general proposition, I do not think that government (policy), on behalf
of the public, that is kept from the public, is to be recommended.'
Sir Richard said he had been 'persuaded' by MI5 and MI6 that it would be
wrong to identify intelligence officers who had appeared as witnesses in
private or reveal the content of their evidence in his report where it
related to their operations. Additional intelligence information made
available to the judge includes that on the Iraqi supergun project.
'I think the personal safety of some of the witnesses would be put at risk
(if they were identified) and that is not a risk I am prepared at any degree
to run. If you are going to have intelligence agencies and secret services,
they had better be kept secret. Otherwise there is no point in having them
at all.'
Even so he said the government had 'certainly shown itself to be
over-secretive in the handling of documents' - a reference to last year's
Matrix Churchill trial in which the government's had tried to keep
classified documents from defence counsel.
'All the documents which have come to us have various differing degrees of
confidentiality or secrecy, according to government criteria. I do not
regard myself bound by any of these criteria. I have said that to government
and I think they accept that position.'
He said he no reason to doubt the government's pledge that the report would
be published as written by him and without any 'cuts' by government
departments. What will not be made available to the public will be an
appendix of evidence gathered from intelligence agents.
Sir Richard rejected criticism of the inquiry's cost - 'a good deal cheaper
than a court case' - and dismissed suggestions that it involved
time-wasting: itably involves the time and co-operation' of Whitehall.
Sir Richard said: 'The reason the inquiry was set up in the first place was
because of a serious degree of public disquiet over what had been happening
in government in connection with arms to Iraq. If the inquiry is going to
serve its proper function, I think it is necessary that the nettle is
grasped and that the maximum part is held in public.'
He added: 'If you are going to have an inquiry, you had better have a
thorough one and put up with the price that has to be paid for that
thoroughness.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / 'The area the judge has been probing is quite absurd'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEHALL INSIDERS are expressing unease about Sir Richard Scott's 'grand
inquisitor' role and the way he is conducting his inquiry.
Officials at the Foreign Office - subjected to particular scrutiny in recent
hearings - say they are 'relaxed' about the inquiry's potential political
impact, and hope some of its recommendations may lead to improvements in the
efficiency of the government machinery.
But they say that in his questioning of witnesses the judge has demonstrated
a lack of administrative experience and appreciation of the complexity of
Whitehall.
One former member of Baroness Thatcher's government said this week: 'The
kind of area the judge has been probing is quite absurd. There are meetings
every week at the Department of Trade and Industry between officials and
companies wanting to sell arms with the Foreign Office waiting in the wings.
The companies win a few, they lose a few. It's nothing.
'I've been involved in keeping things from the press but I regard that as a
public service, as a patriotic duty. If we had to explain ourselves every
time we made a foreign-policy decision there wouldn't be any government.'
Officials say the demands on government departments to produce documentary
evidence are 'vastly expensive' and waste time which could be used on
matters of policy.
Whitehall departments are having to devote one and sometimes two officials
to dealing with the judge's requests on a full-time basis. 'This is not what
we are here for,' said one Whitehall insider.
Another widely shared complaint is that the line of questioning by the judge
and his team does not appear to take into account the political priorities
of the mid 1980s, as opposed to those that prevailed in the aftermath of
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and the ensuing war.
'At the time we were trying to do our best to sell arms,' recalled one
official. 'There were rumours that Kurdish villages were being destroyed by
the Iraqis, but these were dismissed by our embassy in Baghdad at the time.'
One former aide to Lady Thatcher said the former prime minister, who will
give evidence later in the year, was 'unrepentant' about her government's
conduct of arms policy during the 1980s and was preparing a vigorous defence
on com-mercial and pragmatic diplomatic grounds.
'What we were doing was nothing compared to what the French and the Germans
were doing, ' he said, adding that in the tortured world of Middle East
politics, policy was having to be constantly fine-tuned to deal with
changing circumstances.
Other foreign observers remember that in September 1988, Sir Geoffrey (now
Lord) Howe, Lady Thatcher's foreign secretary, said that the evidence of
chemical weapons being used by the Iraqis against Kurdish civilians was
'compelling'
The judge's terms of reference require him to consider not whether the
government was trying to sell arms to Iraq - which it clearly was - but
whether in so doing it was in breach of the law and its own declared
guidelines.

FT  31 JUL 93 / ITC may face court challenge from ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR ITV executives want the powers and responsibilities of the
Independent Television Commission to be tested in court after the row over
the timing of News at Ten.
The ITC and the ITV companies have sharply different legal opinions on the
issue of the main news bulletin.
A judicial review in the High Court is seen as the only way of deciding
which opinion is correct and whether the ITC has the power to insist that
the programme should run at a particular time.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London
Weekend Television, believes the issue is much wider than News at Ten. He
believes that the 1990 Broadcasting Act is ambiguous on the respective
powers and responsibilities of the ITC and the ITV companies. Apart from
timing, he would like a ruling on ITV's obligation to provide a diverse
schedule.
One possibility to be discussed would involve persuading the ITC to
acquiesce in an ITV application for a judicial review to clarify the issue.
Meanwhile opposition is growing to any relaxation of the rules preventing
the nine largest ITV companies taking over each other.
The Glasgow-based Daily Record newspaper has published a letter from Mr Ian
Lang, the Scottish secretary, to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary, in which Mr Lang expresses concern about the implications of such
a relaxation for Scotland.
Regional programme-making obligations might still be enforced but there was
no protection for network programme production in the event of a takeover.
Mr Lang argues for stricter rules so that, at least in Scotland, ITV
companies cannot take over neighbours in order to protect their separate
identities.
Even supporters of the relaxation of takeover rules believe this is now less
likely.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Mail group to spend Pounds 20m on tabloid supplements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Newspapers is launching new tabloid supplements for its three
main titles the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard in
London.
Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said the
initiative, which will cost about Pounds 20m in its first year, would be
partly paid for by cost-cutting and a significant reduction in the group's
television advertising, which totalled more than Pounds 11m last year.
The new supplements, with 48 pages and full colour, represent a departure
for the middle market and are likely to intensify competition when they are
launched in October.
The Daily Mail supplement will accompany the Saturday edition. It will be
aimed at the family and include seven days of television listings.
The new Mail on Sunday section will feature reviews and have longer pieces
of what Mr Hardy called 'reportage', aiming to increase the paper's appeal
to broadsheet readers.
The Evening Standard's supplement will be published on Friday and include
the week's television listings.
Mr Hardy said that five years ago the Daily Mail had an average of 40 pages
with an advertising ratio of 38 per cent. Now the paper has an average of 64
pages with 32 per cent advertising.
He added: 'We have also hardened the advertising rates which is an enormous
achievement during the recession.'
During the same five-year period the Daily Mail's circulation has marginally
increased. In January 1989 it was 1.7366m and in June 1993, the latest
official figures, it was 1.7455m.
Average circulation for the Mail on Sunday between January and March 1989
was 1.977m, and from March to June this year the figure was 1.985m.
Immediate rivals such as the Daily Express and Sunday Express lost
circulation during this period.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Ending of car prefix system urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR INDUSTRY analysts believe up to 410,000 cars will be registered in
August, the fourth-highest volume for a single month in the industry's
history.
But nearly two thirds of car dealers want to discontinue the yearly
registration prefix - L this year - which causes the sales bulge, a survey
by Automotive Management, a motor industry management publication, and Esso,
the oil group, has found.
The prefix system was criticised yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, who
holds the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chair in motor-industry
economics at Cardiff Business School, and is industry adviser to the Commons
trade and industry committee.
Prof Rhys warned that the system conflicted with the 'lean' manufacturing
and distribution practices which the industry needed to remain competitive,
since it required manufacturers and dealers to build up stocks in advance of
August 1, the day the registration prefix changed.
He said: 'The only party now benefiting from the system are Continental
manufacturers, for whom the UK August bulge is a godsend when demand in
their own markets has gone seasonally flat.'
The police favour the prefix system, saying it helps witnesses remember cars
used in crime.
Nearly 700 dealers took part in the survey, which found that 62 per cent
want to abandon the system and 24 per cent favour it.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, which represents most dealers, is
critical of the system. The survey did not consider possible alternatives.
The August 'bulge' - which reached a high point of 500,000 in 1989 - has
sometimes threatened to overwhelm the trade. A government inquiry into the
prefix system towards the end of the 1980s was abandoned when changes could
not be agreed.
The yearly identifier letter should be abandoned, Prof Rhys said, allowing
the market to readjust to seasonal peaks.
He added: 'If August goes as expected, it will mean that 23 per cent of the
year's sales will have been made in one month. Even the Japanese could not
run an inventory-less system with that kind of distortion.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Strength of retail recovery doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in consumer confidence and retail sales may be weaker than
suggested by government statistics, according to a survey carried out by NOP
for Verdict, the retail market research group.
Each month NOP asks 2,000 adults throughout the UK whether they are
seriously considering purchasing nine items - ranging from Pounds 100-worth
of clothes to a house or flat - in the next six months. It adds the
percentage of positive responses in each category together to form a
purchasing intentions index.
Verdict's index for July is 112, unchanged from June. The figures for the
last two months are the lowest this year - after the index reached 125 in
May, 117 in April and 126 in March - and are only slightly above the 110
recorded in July last year.
Verdict said: 'These data are forward-looking, so that one cannot expect the
figures to correlate precisely with current retail sales. But since we began
the series these data have proved to be an excellent barometer of trends,
and we remain convinced that official data are running seriously ahead of
reality.'
Verdict said it remained 'agnostic' about official statistics showing an
inflation-adjusted increase in retail sales of almost 4 per cent
year-on-year.
For this increase to be true, it said, retail multiples would have to be
experiencing growth of about 6 per cent and independent retailers about 3
per cent.
The group said: 'Such levels of growth are not being achieved by the
multiples with whom we are in touch.'
Its own analysis suggests year-on-year growth across all sectors is about 2
per cent.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Judge orders Pounds 1.15m Nadir bail forfeited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIENDS OF Mr Asil Nadir were yesterday ordered to surrender Pounds 1.15m
they promised as bail surety for the fugitive tycoon.
The money was part of a record Pounds 3.5m bail which Mr Nadir skipped in
May when he escaped to northern Cyprus rather than face charges of false
accounting and theft.
Mr Ramadan Guney, the businessman who promised a Pounds 1m bail surety for
Mr Nadir, was yesterday ordered to forfeit Pounds 650,000. Mr Guney appeared
in court after the case had earlier been deferred on the grounds of his
ill-health.
At the Old Bailey Mr Justice Tucker gave Mr Guney six months to pay and
imposed a sentence of two years' imprisonment if he defaulted.
Mr Nadir's ex-wife, Mrs Aysegul Nadir, had promised Pounds 500,000 surety.
Mr Justice Tucker ordered that she pay that sum to the court within 28 days
or go to prison for 18 months.
However, he expressed doubt that she would pay since she was reported to be
in northern Cyprus.
The judge said he was satisfied that Mr Guney had played no part in Mr
Nadir's flight nor aided his escape but he had not taken all reasonable
steps to ensure Mr Nadir appeared for trial.
Mr Guney said he would appeal. 'As far as I can see there is no justice.'
Mr Rick Shearman, Mr Guney's solicitor, said the substance of his client's
case, which the judge heard in private, was that the surety had not been
renewed in June last year when Mr Nadir first appeared in court.
Mr Nadir's bail was comprised of both securities, where the money is
deposited, and sureties, where the money is pledged but not handed over.
A total of Pounds 2m was deposited with Mr Nadir's solicitors as security
for his appearance at court. Ownership of this money is now disputed and is
the subject of a further civil court hearing on August 18.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Banks win tax ruling on BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank, Hambros Bank, and BZW, the securities arm of
Barclays Bank, yesterday won a High Court ruling overturning an Inland
Revenue decision that two Pounds 25m loan-back business expansion schemes
affecting 3,000 investors did not qualify for tax relief.
BES schemes give tax relief to investors at their highest marginal rate if
they hold their investment for five years. In his March Budget Mr Norman
Lamont, then chancellor, abolished loan-back BES schemes, which allowed
investors to withdraw after six months while retaining full BES tax relief
at their top marginal rate.
He ruled that shares in BES companies had to be issued by the midnight
before the Budget if loans were to be made against them.
BZW's Gracechurch companies and National Westminster's Homeshare scheme  -
launched in conjunction with Hambros Bank - had raised their full
subscription of Pounds 25m each after launches in February and the first
week of March respectively. The banks had allotted shares but had not listed
the shareholdings in the companies' register of members by the Budget
deadline.
In May the Inland Revenue decided the shares had not been 'issued' and would
not be eligible for tax relief.
But Mr Justice Rattee ruled yesterday that the word 'issue' had no fixed
meaning and there was 'no reason to think that the legislature intended the
availability of BES tax relief to be dependent on the actual registration of
shareholders or the issue of share certificates'.
The banks' argument is that shares are issued when shareholders have a right
and an obligation to be put on the register of members and that it is not
necessary for a shareholder's name to be typed in for it to be registered.
They had promised to return to investors their original investment should
the legal case fail.
Yesterday the Inland Revenue was considering the implications of the
decision. It has 28 days to file an appeal. It earlier argued that a ruling
in favour of the banks might have wider ramifications.

FT  31 JUL 93 / EC rules 'do not cover pensions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEST case at the Employment Appeal Tribunal has established that pensions
are not covered by the European Community directive that preserves the
rights of employees when businesses change hands or work is contracted out.
The case was over the pension rights of Mr Ernest Warrener, whose company
changed hands in circumstances that were covered by the EC's Acquired Rights
Directive 1977.
The tribunal ruled that the new owner was not required to offer the same
pension provisions to employees which they had enjoyed under their previous
owner.
The judgment was described as 'decisive' by Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of
City solicitors Norton Rose.
She said: 'The tribunal backs the government view that the directive
protects only the accumulated rights of employees up to the time an
undertaking is transferred.'
This will come as a relief to contractors bidding for public-sector
contracts, since pension provisions are often much more generous in the
public sector. Last night Mr John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and
Support Services Association, said the judgment as 'very useful'.
He said: 'It clears the air on one of the major issues hanging over the
government's contracting-out programme.'
However, a second test case completed yesterday at the tribunal confirmed
that the directive can apply to contracting-out of public-sector services.
In a judgment over a refuse collection contract in Eastbourne, East Sussex,
the tribunal said that the pay and conditions of staff whose jobs are
contracted out could be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection
of Employment) regulations 1981, which implemented the directive in UK law.
This appears to confirm advice given by the government's law officers in the
spring that recent cases in the European Court of Justice have widened the
scope of the Tupe regulations to compulsory competitive tendering.
Where the regulations apply, they protect the jobs and conditions of
employment of the workforce when their jobs are transferred to another
employer.
However, the Eastbourne judgment was immediately greeted by Mr Jack Dromey
of the TGWU general union as 'a historic verdict'.
He invited the government to offer compensation to those who had lost their
jobs or pay as a result of contracting out. Otherwise they would face
thousands of claims for compensation for not properly implementing EC
legislation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and France have agreed to join forces in persuading the European
Community to change the Acquired Rights Directive 1977. Implementation of
the directive in the UK through the Tupe regulations has created uncertainty
over its application when public services are contracted out.
The French government is believed to be concerned about the impact of the
directive on its plans to privatise state-owned banks and industries.
At Monday's summit meeting, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr
Francois Mitterrand, the French president, agreed to include the directive
in 24 items of EC legislation they wish to be reviewed.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Business jet users attack BAA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOBBY group backed by some of Britain's largest companies has lodged a
complaint with the European Commission against BAA, alleging
anti-competitive practices.
It accuses BAA, which operates London's largest airports, of unfairly
excluding some business jets so that more commercial aircraft on scheduled
flights can use the overcrowded run-ways.
Some companies using business aircraft have contacted the office of Mr
Richard Needham, the trade minister, to argue that business aircraft should
continue to have free access to Heathrow.
BAA acknowledged that it wants to give more landing slots to bigger aircraft
and had cancelled some of the peak-time slots reserved for business
aircraft.
Private aircraft account for 4 per cent of the traffic at Heathrow.
The lobby group intends to take BAA to the European Court in Luxembourg.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Barclays to amend client data policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS YESTERDAY promised to amend its customer application forms after
banks were told that they had to allow customers to choose whether their
personal account details can be used by subsidiaries to market products.
Barclays, Britain's biggest bank, has required customers applying for new
accounts, credit cards or loans to sign forms saying that they consent to
account information being given to other companies in the Barclays group.
The review committee considering amendments to the voluntary code of banking
practice said that it would alter the code from next March to ensure that
this approach to consent to the internal use of data for marketing products
was barred.
The committee warned in its annual report that if customers were asked to
agree to their names and addresses being passed to other companies in a
banking group they should be 'given a clear option to say no if they wish'.
The committee also criticised banks for their 'undesirable coyness' over
informing customers about their internal complaints procedures, and for
using 'gobbledegook' in contracts setting out conditions of services.
The ruling comes after controversy over the ways in which banks have
interpreted the code's requirement that customers should give 'express
consent' before their account details can be used for purposes such as life
insurance selling.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, and Mr Eric Howe, the
data-protection registrar, have both expressed concern about apparent
efforts by banks, including Barclays and National Westminster, to circumvent
this.
Sir Bryan recently accused some banks of breaking the 'spirit and perhaps
even the letter' of their code. NatWest has assured its life insurance
sellers access to the bank's current account data by making them bank
employees.
Mr Howe said in his annual report this month that the code's benefit was
'clearly negated' if banks refused to allow customers access to services
unless they signed forms giving consent for data disclosure in the group.
The committee said that 'tacit acquiescence' as a result of customer inertia
or 'their understandable failure to read through the fine print to the end
will not be regarded as an acceptable form of consent' when the code is
amended.
The committee, chaired by Sir George Blunden, is reviewing the code after
receiving more than 20 submissions from organisations including consumer
groups.
Barclays said it could not estimate the cost of the change, although it
would have to alter application forms.
It said it was complying with the code as it stood, but would make any
changes necessary to comply with the revised version.
The difference in interpretation among banks has caused some tension. Lloyds
Bank, which asks all customers to sign consent forms, said in its submission
that the definition of express consent should be standardised.

FT  31 JUL 93 / High crime risk for small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL BUSINESSES run a far greater risk of becoming a target for crime than
individuals or homes, a Home Office study of crime prevention schemes has
shown, Charles Batchelor writes.
The study found that 40 per cent of burglary victims suffered a second
burglary within 12 months, and 48 per cent of 're-burgled' businesses
suffered a third burglary.
There was widespread concern among owners of small businesses - up to two
thirds were 'worried or very worried' about becoming victims of crime.
The study, which looked at small businesses in Hartlepool, Lewisham in
south-east London, Nottingham, Salford, Sunderland and Wirral, recommends a
seven-point plan for crime prevention. This includes closer co-operation
between businesses in High Street Watch schemes, more help from large
companies and better collection of data to identify patterns of crime
against small business.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Israeli onslaught ignores Hizbollah truce offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday ignored a truce offer from pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas
and vowed to continue its devastating aerial and artillery bombardment of
villages in southern Lebanon.
The decision not to let up in its offensive came amid continuing US efforts
behind the scenes to arrange a ceasefire after six days of bombing of
southern Lebanon by Israeli warplanes and heavy calibre cannons.
Israel's cabinet, which held a special meeting in Tel Aviv, said it would
continue the onslaught which has driven more than a quarter of a million
Shia Moslem villagers from their homes until Hizbollah stopped rocket
attacks on Israel. At least 126 people have been killed since Sunday and
more than 500 wounded.
Before the cabinet meeting, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of
the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah said they would stop attacks after
Israel carried out a 'complete and permanent halt of aggression against
villages and civilians.'
Beirut interpreted the move as a measure of defensiveness from Hizbollah,
the target of increasing criticism from many among the 300,000 refugees from
the south for having triggered their plight.
With Israel apparently implacable in its insistence that it will not stop
the bombardment without hard guarantees first that Hizbollah attacks will
also be halted, all eyes in Beirut yesterday were fixed firmly on Damascus,
where Syria, Iran and Lebanon held a second day of talks.
The Lebanese government has said it is politically incapable of moving
against Hizbollah, although it is widely felt by diplomats and Lebanese
politicians that the Lebanese army could control the fighters if Syria gave
its political approval.
The anxiousness of Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, to find
some such formula is clearly signalled by the fact that he has now spent
most of the last three days in Damascus, where his talks with Mr Farouk
Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, were unexpectedly joined on Thursday by
Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister - bringing together in
Damascus both of Hizbollah's main sponsors.
Nothing had emerged from these talks by late last night but Lebanese
politicians expected an announcement that Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, would postpone his visit to the region by at least 48
hours as an attempt to increase further the pressure on Syria to agree to
rein in Hizbollah.
Meanwhile, in a special briefing for US reporters Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's
foreign minister, said the government had ruled out both a ground offensive
and an expansion of the area of southern Lebanon it controls.
His remarks followed a large deployment of tanks and motorised infantry into
the buffer zone on Thursday evening.
Further troop reinforcements and between 40 and 50 tanks and other equipment
crossed the border yesterday into the zone after guerrillas had fired rocket
salvoes into Israel.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Job openings and overtime drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB openings fell sharply in Japan last month, while overtime in the
manufacturing industry contracted by a year-on-year 15.7 per cent,
suggesting a continued economic slowing in spite of official suggestions
that the downturn has ended, writes Robert Thomson.
The labour ministry said the ratio of job offers to applicants fell from
0.81 in May to 0.74, although the official jobless figure, slow to reflect
changes in the labour market, was unchanged from a month earlier at 2.5 per
cent.
New job offers fell in all sectors, apart from construction, which has
received most of the benefits of two government spending packages over the
past year. Offers in the manufacturing sector fell 26.3 per cent from a year
earlier and in the service sector by 15.4 per cent.
Meanwhile, the 15.7 per cent fall in manufacturing industry overtime
followed a 14 per cent decrease in May. For all industries, average overtime
contracted 10.8 per cent in June.
The weakness in the job market is an indication of the decline in economic
activity, and a sign that the seven-party coalition expected to form a
government next week will face immediate challenges in economic policy.
Consumer prices in Tokyo this month rose 0.4 per cent from June and were 1.7
per cent higher than a year earlier, due to an increase in vegetable prices
blamed on an unsusually long rainy season, the management and co-ordination
agency said yesterday.
Apart from vegetables, there was a 0.5 per cent increase in housing
expenses, reflecting the higher rents in desirable residential areas.
Clothing and footwear prices fell 2.5 per cent, apparently because of an
increase in cheaper products imported from China.
Construction orders received by leading contractors fell 17.1 per cent in
June, compared with a year earlier, with private sector orders down 24.7 per
cent and those from manufacturers down 50 per cent.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Italy gropes through bribes maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE mother of all bribes paid out in Italy's corruption scandals is now
known to be L135bn (Pounds 56m).
Breaking the wall of silence surrounding this payment to political parties,
individual politicians, businessmen and middlemen has been a central
objective of Milan magistrates since the beginning of the year.
The payments relate to the 'Enimont affair' - the abortive attempt in
1989-90 to reorganise the chemicals industry by merging public sector
interests of Eni, the state oil concern, with private sector assets of
Montedison, the Ferruzzi group's chemicals arm, in a joint venture, Enimont.
Milan magistrates were convinced the murky background to the Enimont affair
would expose the extent to which the government, controlled by Christian
Democrats and Socialists, subverted Italy's business life to their own
illicit ends. If the allegations, leaked by magistrates over the past 24
hours, are proved correct, discrediting of the political establishment will
be complete.
The magistrates appear satisfied they have got what they want. Two key
witnesses in the Enimont affair - Mr Giuseppe Garafano, former Montedison
chief executive, and Mr Carlo Sama, his successor, who is married to a
daughter of the founder of the Ferruzzi emp-ire - have been secretly
released from jail. This emerged yesterday, though they were released to
house arrest on Thursday.
Milan magistrates have adopted a policy of keeping people in jail on
corruption charges until they confess. Mr Garofano was arrested in
Switzerland on July 13 and extradited with unprecedented speed two days
later. Mr Sama was arrested on Friday last week, the day when Mr Raul
Gardini, his brother-in-law and former head of Montedison, committed suicide
 -the fourth in the Enimont affair.
Mr Gardini is alleged to have arranged a first bribe of L15bn, paid to the
Christian Democrats and Socialists in 1989 to ensure Montedison got tax
breaks when it merged its chemical interests with those of Eni to form
Enimont.
The big bribe came when Mr Gardini broke his pact with Eni over joint
control of Enimont. Unknown to Eni, then run by Mr Giuseppe Cagliari, who
also committed suicide last week, Mr Gardini acquired 11 per cent of the
outstanding 20 per cent of Enimont through three associates. Eni found out
and persuaded a Milan court to freeze Enimont's shares. These were then
placed in the custody of Mr Vincenzo Palladino, currently deputy chairman of
Banca Commerciale Italiana.
To extricate himself, Mr Gardini offered to sell Montedison's 40 per cent
stake to Eni. For this Eni paid L2,805bn - now believed to be at least
L600bn above the real value. Eni paid a further L1,360bn for minority
shareholders, including Mr Gardini's associates. In return there was a
political pay-off of L100bn plus Dollars 20m.
This amount is believed to relate to 5 per cent of Montedison's real profits
on the Enimont stake sale to Eni. Montedison was able to pay over the funds
through off-balance-sheet operations, phoney property deals and transactions
between foreign subsidiaries.
Milan magistrates are understood to have warned eight senior politicians
they are under investigation for being involved in this alleged payment. Mr
Arnaldo Forlani, Christian Democrat leader at the time, has already got such
a warning, in which he is alleged to have received L35bn.
Mr Bettino Craxi, then leader of the Socialist party which regarded the oil
and chemicals industry as its fiefdom, is alleged to have got a staggering
L75bn. He, too, denies involvement, but yesterday admitted the party had
received political contributions from both Montedison and the Ferruzzi group
as a whole.
The rest of the funds were allegedly handed to Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a
senior Christian Democrat minister and close ally of the then premier, Mr
Giulio Andreotti; and Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist deputy prime
minister.
To smooth the deal, it is alleged Mr Pallidino, who was supervising the
frozen Enimont shares, was bribed L2.5bn. He was arrested on Thursday, but
his laywer yesterday denied this sum was a bribe and said it was a
professional fee from Montedison. It is further alleged share dealings
during the Enimont affair were smoothed by the help of Mr Bruno Pazzi, head
of Consob, the Milan stock exchange watchdog body. Mr Pazzi, an appointee of
Mr Andreotti, was arrested in connection with Enimont on Wednesday.
Even after Montedison pulled out of Enimont, Ferruzzi-Montedison went on
paying the politicians - allegedly handing out up to L7bn for the April 1992
elections to the five parties that formed the government coalition during
the Enimont affair.
The Republican Party yesterday admitted to receiving L300m to this effect.
Eni is still in arbitration with Montedison over what it claims to be
over-valued chemical plant brought by the latter into the Enimont joint
venture.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Rabin faces his greatest challenge: Israel's PM is being
dragged into Lebanese mire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, is facing his greatest challenge
since taking office a year ago: how to draw Israel's bombardment of southern
Lebanon to a close in a way that maximises his domestic standing, wins back
international support and advances his government's peace agenda while
continuing to guarantee what he sees as the country's security.
Having gone in to Lebanon expecting quicker results, Mr Rabin now faces the
prospect of being sucked into the Lebanese quagmire, as Israel was when it
invaded in 1982, and is scrambling around for ways to get out with tangible
benefits.
The relentless bombardment of Lebanese civilians has alienated international
opinion, including the US, threatened the Middle East peace process and
revealed political strains in his coalition government.
Yet it has also exposed one of the foundations of Mr Rabin's premiership:
his belief that only by acting tough can he force Arab states into
concessions in the peace process and maintain a broad popular base for the
best peace deal.
'Rabin is committed to peace but don't forget he was elected on a narrow
margin because people saw him as a strongman who made no concessions on the
security of Israel,' said Mr Yoel Marcus, an Israeli political commentator.
'He can say to the public: trust me in peace talks because the first thing
on my mind will be a deal which does not harm Israel's existence and its
security.'
Supporters of Mr Rabin's labour-led coalition - the left-wing Meretz party
and the five Arab MPs - continue to criticise the Israeli operation as
'immoral,' largely for its tragic impact on the lives of half a million Shia
villagers in southern Lebanon.
At least half the cabinet, including four Labour ministers, have voiced
their opposition to the operation. But the ability of the cabinet and
parliamentary critics to influence Mr Rabin remains severely circumscribed
by the initial popularity of the action and by the fact that any serious
threat to the coalition could pave the way to a return to power by the
right-wing Likud party.
An opinion poll in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper yesterday showed 93 per
cent of Israelis supported the action when interviewed on Wednesday.
For the moment, Mr Rabin has successfully boosted his image as a tough and
unrepentant warrior for Israel - undermining the claims of Likud as the
party of 'security.'
However, there are political limitations and diplomatic dangers with this
policy. Any commitment of ground troops in Lebanon could place unbearable
strains on the coalition and quickly turn the public, which remains haunted
by the disastrous 1982 war with Lebanon, against the government.
Political analysts say Mr Rabin is still haunted by the memories of the 1967
Middle East war when he was Chief of Staff and continues to see peace with
Syria as the main ambition of his premiership. He views the pro-Iranian
Hizbollah guerrillas, the ostensible target of the offensive, and the
Lebanese government itself, as proxies of Syrian interests in the region.
Analysts say at least part of Mr Rabin's strategy is to show Syria and other
Arab states that Israel under Labour has not gone soft and will negotiate
from a position of strength. Mr Rabin also aims to exert maximum pressure on
Syria to make concessions on a comprehensive regional peace deal.
The deal would involve the phased return of most or all of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Syria in return for full peace, including
trade and diplomatic relations and guaranteed security on both the
Israeli-Syrian and the Israeli-Lebanese borders. Israel would also agree a
phased withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
Senior government officials believe the present crisis could be turned into
an opportunity with the involvement of the US. But this would assume
Damascus, Beirut and Washington would accept a delinking of the Palestinian
and Jordanian talks from those with Syria and Lebanon - a move many believe
is unlikely.
Critics, however, say Mr Rabin's military strategy, which remains
unsuccessful so long as Hizbollah continues to hit Israel with rockets,
depends far too much on a response from the other side. After President Bill
Clinton's praise for 'Syrian restraint' during the conflict they say Israel
will have to pay a price to Syria at the negotiating table for allowing
Damascus to emerge as the key to a regional solution. Furthermore, they
believe that without a durable peace deal, the operation could swell the
ranks of Hizbollah, destabilise Lebanon, and create a worsening security
threat to Israel.
Mr Rabin's offensive against Lebanon was always risky. Unless a there is a
breakthrough soon, it is difficult to see how the prime minister will be
able to extricate himself from the crisis unscathed both at home and abroad.
The longer the conflict continues, the greater the risks to Mr Rabin's
international and domestic standing and to the entire Middle East peace
process.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations last night ordered an immediate inquiry into charges by a
London-based rights group that UN troops in Somalia killed and tortured
civilians and little was done to discipline the offenders, writes Michael
Littlejohns in New York.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, said the allegations by
Africa Rights, part of a prestigious group that includes Helsinki Watch,
were being taken 'very seriously.' The report was transmitted to Admiral
Jonathan Howe, his representative in Mogadishu, who was already discussing
the question with General Cevik Bir, the UN force commander, and other
military officers.
There have been persistent charges of UN excesses from other quarters, and a
publc row with General Bruno Loi, commander of the Italian contingent, led
to a demand by New York that he be sent home. Italy, Germany and Ireland
responded by calling for a thorough re-examination of the UN role in Somalia
but this has yet to be done.
Africa Rights asserted that UN actions had earned the hatred of the very
people the troops were sent to help and that Admiral Howe, an American, was
considered by them to be 'another warlord.'
The report alleged that Pakistani troops machine-gunned demonstrators in
Mogadishu last month and that an 850-strong Belgian contingent in Kismayu
was especially brutal, dragging a Somali through the streets behind a
military vehicle and hitching the body of another to a tank.
In another incident, the Belgians were said to have driven off field workers
with machine gun fire and then to have stolen an entire crop of melons.

TURKEY'S respected Central Bank Governor Rusdu Saracoglu announced his
resignation yesterday after a long policy dispute with Mrs Tansu Ciller, the
new prime minister, John Murray Brown writes from Istanbul.
The departure of Mr Saracoglu, a pivotal figure in the country's economic
progress of the 1980s, will inevitably raise new doubts about Turkey's
commitment to a policy of stable prices.
Mrs Ciller has criticised the governor for his support of high interest
rates to protect the currency at a time when exports are falling and the
trade gap widening.
However, Mrs Ciller's failure to curb the fiscal deficit had forced her to
turn increasingly to the Central Bank, much to the governor's chagrin, for
short-term advances - thus fuelling monetary expansion.
In 1992, the Bank abandoned its monetary targeting and adopting a more
limited strategy to dampen exchange rate volatility, vital if Turkey is to
bring inflation down from around 60 per cent.
Turkish bankers yesterday played down the impact on the markets, although
the timing, coming just before the weekend, suggests the government is keen
to limit the damage.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Clinton budget to face final vote
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's budget will face a final vote in Congress next week
after negotiators from the House of Representatives and the Senate yesterday
wrapped up a compromise bill.
Negotiators settled on an increase of 4.3 cents per American gallon in the
federal petrol tax, slashing the revenue Mr Clinton had planned to raise
from a broader energy tax and in the process disappointing both left wingers
who wanted more money for social programmes and fiscal hawks who wanted a
more serious effort at curbing the budget deficit.
Passage of the budget next week is by no means assured. The House passed its
original version in May by only six votes, while in the Senate
Vice-President Al Gore's casting vote broke a 49-49 tie last month.
'It'll be tight as a tick in the Senate, but I think in the last analysis
we'll push the ball over the goal line in both bodies,' Mr Roger Altman, the
deputy Treasury secretary, said yesterday.
Even if the budget does pass, it will bear only a passing resemblance to the
economic programme originally outlined by Mr Clinton when he took office.
The centrepiece of that programme was a new energy tax levied at 25.7 cents
per million British thermal units on most fuels, with an additional 34.2
cents per million BTUs on oil, to raise Dollars 71.4bn over five years.
House negotiators this week went along with the Senate's decision to drop
this broad energy tax in favour of simply increasing the petrol tax, and on
Thursday night they even gave up their efforts to cajole the Senate into
accepting an increase greater than the 4.3 cents per gallon it passed in
June.
The result is only Dollars 23bn of revenue over five years, making it much
harder to pay for the urban and low income spending programmes that some
House members have made the price of their support.
Congress has also resuscitated many of its favourite pork barrel spending
programmes, such as honey subsidies and rural electrification loans, as well
as preserving tax loopholes such as the tax deductibility of business meals,
while slashing Mr Clinton's proposals to shift spending into new areas he
classified as 'investments'.
In the end, Congress's unwillingness either to raise energy taxes or to cut
spending has even forced the Clinton administration to give way on its
overriding goal of trimming the federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn over
five years from its current projected path.
The compromise budget bill seemed sure to fall short of the Dollars 500bn
target, although Democratic leaders were still scrambling to ensure it beat
the Dollars 482bn cut claimed by the 1990 budget agreement.

self-proclaimed reformer, Mr Yohei Kono, as its president in an attempt to
prove to the public that the scandal-stained party is starting afresh.
In the past, the LDP president has automatically become the prime minister,
but the fate of Mr Kono, 56, will be determined at a parliamentary session
scheduled for next Thursday, for which a coalition of seven opposition
parties has secured enough votes to defeat the LDP.
Unless the coalition crumbles in the next few days, Mr Kono, the chief
cabinet secretary, will find himself the leader of the largest opposition
party in the Japanese parliament, though he expressed pride yesterday that
he was chosen 'in these diffficult times.'
Mr Kono defeated Mr Michio Watanabe, 70, the former foreign minister, in an
intra-party election by 208 votes to 159. The appointment of the ailing Mr
Watanabe would have been a sign that the LDP had learned little from the
events of the past few weeks, highlighted by the loss of its parliamentary
majority in a general election.
The party presidency was vacant after the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
73, who will remain prime minister until the parliamentary vote. There are
two candidates for the prime ministership, Mr Kono and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
the Japan New party leader and the coalition's chosen representative.
A stable coalition can expect at least 245 votes in the parliamentary poll,
while the LDP is certain of only 225 votes and is relying on a rupture in
the coalition to avoid a term in opposition for the first time since 1955.
The LDP and Mr Kono are hoping that factional strife in the Social
Democratic party, the largest opposition party, may prompt some left-wing
members to abstain in protest at the party's joining of hands with
conservative groups.
Ms Takako Doi, the former SDP leader, said yesterday the party was losing
its identity by linking with parties formed by ex-LDP members, but did not
say she would abstain. Ms Doi has good reason to support the coalition, as
she may receive a senior post in the cabinet or be chosen as lower house
speaker if the seven parties form the next governemnt.
A member of Mr Miyazawa's faction, Mr Kono's claims as a reformer are based
on his own defection from the LDP in the mid-1970s at the time of the
Lockheed bribery scandal. He became a member of the New Liberal Club, which
was reunited with the LDP in 1986, although the party had done little to end
the 'money politics' behind most Japanese scandals.
'It is my responsibility to restore public confidence in the LDP and
politics,' Mr Kono said. 'If you look at the coalition and their selection
of a leader, you have to say that the choice of Mr Hosokawa was very
unclear. Why didn't the SDP, the largest of the parties, provide a leader?'

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Fund managers rush to limit their exposure -
Whitehall claims vindication
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
POLITICIANS in Europe have frequently blamed speculators for the crises in
the exchange rate mechanism. But the frantic selling of the franc yesterday
appeared to be by pension funds and companies with international
investments, which do not normally take speculative positions in currency
markets.
Throughout the last few days, fund managers have been particularly concerned
that a devaluation of the French franc could undermine the value of French
bonds and equities they hold. They have therefore hedged the exposure of
these instruments by selling the French franc now, fearing that its exchange
rate will soon depreciate.
Pension fund managers intervene in the currency markets comparatively
rarely. But the sums that they have under management are vast, and much
greater than the reserves held by central banks.
The other group of players who were selling the French franc yesterday were
the New York-based hedge funds - of which the Soros Fund, run by the
entrepreneur, Mr George Soros, is the best known.
These funds are highly speculative players, but for most of this week they
have taken a very low profile. Last weekend, Mr Soros told a French
newspaper that he was not speculating against the franc because of his
support for European monetary union.
Yesterday, he changed his stance, in a statement saying that it was 'futile
to protect the European Monetary System by abstaining from trading in
currencies.' That statement may have brought a new wave of panic to the
market. But, at the end of European trading yesterday, some analysts thought
these hedge funds were playing a comparatively small part in this crisis.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Frankfurt dives for cover from the flak -
Bundesbank battens down hatches

THE Bundesbank took up an increasingly embattled position yesterday, as its
smaller than expected interest rate cut and an ambiguous comment by one of
its directors led to confusion and criticism among economists and currency
dealers.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank director, said the German central
bank would not act to stop money market rates from falling below the
discount rate - unchanged at 6.75 per cent on Thursday - if intervention in
the European Monetary System led to a flood of liquidity.
He said the bank would not offer Treasury Bills to soak up liquidity created
by currency intervention.
Thus call market rates could fall below the discount rate and the securities
repurchase (repo) rate, now at 6.95 per cent.
Mr Gaddum's comments, which appeared to go against the Bundesbank's refusal
to cut official rates further, caused considerable uncertainty in the
markets.
'It seems a rather crazy statement,' said Mr Gwyn Hacche, a senior economist
at James Capel, the UK investment house.
This week the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank cut the Lombard rate by half a
percentage point to 7.75 per cent, disappointing those who had hoped for a
discount rate cut to ease strains on the EMS.
Further indicating the continuing pressures on the Bundesbank, Mr Otmar
Issing, another director, declined to appear on a lunchtime financial
television programme yesterday, having previously confirmed his attendance.
While economists generally felt that the European exchange rate mechanism
could not hold out in its present form much longer, they were unsure whether
anything would happen this weekend.
Mr Hans-Helmut Kotz, economist at Deutsche Girozentrale, called this week's
Lombard rate cut 'a purely symbolic action that will only cause irritation
at best'.
He felt fairly certain that something would occur this weekend, in view of
the burden placed on the French economy by the franc's current parity and
the high interest rate levels needed to support this.
'The Bundesbank could be starting its holiday with a working weekend,' he
added. Mr Adolf Rosenstock, economist in Frankfurt for Industrial Bank of
Japan, said: 'We are probably already experiencing the agony or even the
final hours of the EMS's fixed rate system.'
In Bonn, government officials refused to comment publicly about what impact
the Bundesbank's actions would have on the future of the ERM.
But privately officials said they were increasingly concerned about
relations between Bonn and Paris in the light of the Bundesbank's decision
to give priority to the domestic economy.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Opening the way to base rate cuts -
Competitive gains threatened
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE European exchange rate mechanism on the brink of collapse, analysts
were yesterday relishing the implications for the UK economy.
The release of continental European currencies from the mechanism would
allow governments to cut interest rates and stimulate economic growth. This
would help UK manufacturers struggling to sell exports in exceptionally
sluggish European economies.
The danger for the UK is that the competitive gains of devaluation that have
boosted UK exports since September would be threatened by devalued European
currencies. UK exporters would have to work harder to maintain market share.
But, while a collapse of the ERM could threaten the UK's competitive gains,
it would also open the way for further UK base rate cuts as former ERM
members gave up the battle to hold their currencies at certain values and
eased monetary policy.
The UK government bond market reflected that belief with prices rising
sharply and pushing long-term yields, which mirror the market's perception
of future inflation, down to 7.825 per cent, their lowest level for well
over 20 years. The 10-year gilt futures contract for September shot forward
almost a full percentage point and closed  23/32 higher at 109.23 after some
investors took profits.
The Bank of England took advantage of the continued enthusiasm for gilts by
announcing a Pounds 1.3bn issue of stock. Although gilts thrive on political
stability buyers ignored the potentially disruptive effect of a huge Tory
by-election defeat in Christchurch, southern England.
Economists cautioned that most of the buying was fuelled by foreign
investors attracted by the UK's status as a currency safe haven. They said
that if the existing structure of the ERM crumbled the UK's competitive
advantage might be eroded as ERM members cut rates independently.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: UK harks back to warning of 'fault lines' -
Grim satisfaction in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government last night found it hard to disguise a mood of grim
satisfaction, as its European partners struggled to preserve the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Humiliated by sterling's departure last autumn from the currency grid,
Whitehall officials and their political masters could at last claim
vindication. The system, as Mr John Major declared at the time, had indeed
developed serious fault lines. The prime minister had been right also to
declare European monetary union a distant dream, not a short-term reality.
But the inevitable self-justification disguised a less sanguine assessment
of the prospects for the European - and British - economies if the present
era of managed exchange rates were to end in the ERM's disintegration.
The Whitehall judgment was that decoupling of the French franc and other ERM
currencies from the D-Mark could support Britain's fledgling economic
recovery. Lower interest rates and stronger growth in the rest of the
Community would provide expanding markets for the exports on which the UK
upturn depends.
Senior Conservative Euro-sceptics were quick also to point out the potential
political gains for the UK government.
A dramatic failure of Franco-German monetary co-operation would impose
severe strains on the core alliance which has so often consigned Britain to
the European sidelines. Mr Major's hopes of a more symmetrical relationship
between London, Bonn and Paris would be greatly strengthened. So, too, would
Mr Major's voice in decisions over the next few years on the Community's
future.
But the more cautious British ministers - Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, among them - see
countervailing disadvantages.
Mr Clarke, long an advocate of managed, stable exchange rates, sees no
advantage in competitive devaluations across the EC. The benefits of lower
interest rates might be offset in the short term by the damaging blow
delivered to business confidence by a collapse of the exchange rate grid.
Even though sterling's exit from the ERM led to sharply lower borrowing
costs, the immediate effect was to damage the recovery prospects.
The advantages Britain secured following sterling's devaluation last autumn
have already been eroded by the recent rise in the pound's value. Exporters
are warning that weakening exports threaten the pace of growth.
Nor does the government see any medium-term gain for industry from a return
to the era of free floating. The single market was designed to create a
level, stable playing field for European business. Britain would lose as
much as anyone if that were undermined by unpredictable gyrations in
exchange rates.

GOLD'S PRICE burst through the psychologically important Dollars 400 a troy
ounce level yesterday for the first time since the Gulf war 31 months ago,
writes Kenneth Gooding, mining correspondent.
New York investment funds used the turmoil in European currency markets as a
launching point for another attack on a target they have been attempting to
reach since the April campaign by high-profile financiers Sir James
Goldsmith and Mr George Soros re-ignited interest in the gold market.
Gold jumped by Dollars 9.40 an ounce in London from Thursday's closing price
to reach Dollars 404.50 early yesterday after overnight buying by the US
funds drove it up in the Far East. More New York buying emerged late in the
day to take gold to Dollars 405.75 an ounce, up Dollars 11.65, by the close
of trading in London.
Traders report that physical demand for the metal has virtually dried up
because of the speed of the gold price rise from a seven-year low point of
Dollars 327 an ounce in January.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: The nightmare facing French policy makers -
Pursuing rational economics means political humiliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE problem with the struggle over the future of the European exchange rate
mechanism is that the economics and the politics are out of kilter. From a
purely economic point of view, France is obviously neglecting its real
economic interests by clinging with such fierce determination to the
virtually fixed exchange rate against the D-Mark. But from a political point
of view, the ERM at its existing exchange rates has acquired all the
symbolism of the commitment to closer European integration encapsulated in
the Treaty of Maastricht.
This may not be rational, but it is a fact. If France were not compelled to
follow the perverse constraints of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy,
it would be free to respond to low inflation and rising unemployment by
sharply lowering its interest rates.
But the medium-term political trade-offs would look much more dubious.
First, the reputation of the franc as a hard currency would once again be on
the line; and the abandonment of the franc fort policy would require a
wrenching domestic political reappraisal, since it has been followed with
rare unanimity by both left and right in France for ten years.
More generally, abandonment of existing exchange rate policy would mean that
the credibility of the exchange rate mechanism itself would start to be in
question. Most serious of all, the prospects for economic and monetary
union, already seriously battered by successive waves of speculative attack,
would be further discredited.
When President Francois Mitterrand opted in 1983 for what came to be called
the franc fort policy, he was effectively discarding most of his election
commitments to old-fashioned socialism in France. Instead, he was putting a
higher priority on three other values: France's ability to compete in
international markets in the outside world, France's reputation as a
fiscally responsible country, and France's commitments to the European
Community.
To begin with, the government's new objectives were quite modest: to put an
end to soaring trade and budget deficits, to bring down rising inflation,
and stop the repeated devaluations. But as the new policy started to work,
it became the centrepiece of France's progressive conversion to market
economics, both in the official establishment and among the electorate.
In addition it also became the starting point for all subsequent official
thinking in France about the future development of the European Community.
Without the franc fort conversion in 1983, it is unlikely that France could
have accepted the 1985 programme for a Single European Market; and without
the accumulated success of the franc fort policy, it is inconceivable that
France could have gone along with, let alone proposed, the plan for economic
and monetary union eventually incorporated in the Maastricht treaty.
But the political corollary of the success of the franc fort policy was even
more profound, because it vastly increased the confidence of French
politicians, including President Francois Mitterrand, in their attitudes to
the relationship with Germany. Previous French leaders, starting with
President Charles de Gaulle, had always known that France was economically
much weaker than Germany; but they attempted to dominate Germany
politically, by virtue of the wartime inheritance, France's possession of
nuclear weapons and a seat on the Security Council, and Germany's division
and diminished sovereignty.
But after the franc fort policy began to produce consistent benefits in the
late 1980s, with steadily falling inflation, the French started to think
that they might even be able to compete with Germany on terms of economic
equality as well. This new economic self-confidence goes a long way to
explain the extraordinary partnership between President Mitterrand and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
First, it meant that both of them could believe that their own countries
would benefit from ever-more ambitious plans for the integration of a
federal Europe. Moreover, when the Germans were reunited and recovered their
political sovereignty, it meant that President Mitterrand was able to
overcome his initial reflex of revulsion, and instead press for a further
acceleration of the Community's integration plans. And in the end, he
claimed that monetary union in Europe would make the Community the world's
number one monetary power.
But the converse is that the franc exchange rate has become a virility
symbol of French economic strength. If it were to be blown out of the ERM,
that would be a major humiliation on political grounds of self-respect.
The problem today is that this logical construction, built up from the
foundations of the franc fort, is now turning into a nightmare for French
policy makers. In a logical world, it might make sense to argue for a
temporary suspension of the ERM, until Germany has digested the costs of
unification; it might make sense to re-think the timing and the criteria of
the programme for economic and monetary union.
The difficulty is that the recent perverse effects of the franc fort policy,
notably the aggravation of the recession and the increase in unemployment,
have seriously undermined French popular support for Maastricht, leading
last March to a catastrophic defeat for the Socialist government. It might
be constructive to re-negotiate a more plausible programme for Emu; but by
now there may no longer be enough popular support in France for such an
objective, to enable it to be ratified.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Franc fort on brink of surrender - Markets
unleash fierce assault on French currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Edouard Balladur, France's unflappable prime minister, emerged late
on Thursday night from crisis talks with his economic and monetary officials
to decide how to defend the franc, he said it had been 'just a normal day'.
But even by Mr Balladur's sanguine standards, the events of yesterday were
abnormal. The markets unleashed a fierce assault on the franc, following
Thursday's unexpected decision by Germany's Bundesbank to leave its discount
rate unchanged. The franc fell to its ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the
D-Mark despite concerted intervention by the French and German central
banks.
Economists argued yesterday that the current franc/D-Mark parity was
probably untenable and that the French govern-ment's franc fort policy was
on the brink of defeat.
The government now faces a series of painful decisions. The first is whether
to try to tough it out. The franc fort is the centrepiece of French economic
policy, and the current franc/D-Mark rate is unlikely to be surrendered
without a fight.
Economists argue that this would involve continued heavy intervention by the
Bank of France, if necessary with a rise in French official short term
interest rates above their current 10 per cent level. The French central
bank has an estimated FFr123bn of net reserves to deploy and it would also
expect to receive support from the Bundesbank. One diplomat said yesterday
the French strategy might have been to let the franc fall to its ERM floor
rate so as to force the German authorities to intervene on the franc's
behalf.
A strategy of intervention and high French interest rates was used
successfully to defend the currency in previous attacks in September last
year and January this year. But the current situation is more complex.
France is in recession. INSEE, the state statistics institute, forecasts a
0.7 per cent fall in gross domestic product this year. Meanwhile industry is
pleading for lower interest rates.
Observers argue that these constraints mean that realignment of the French
currency within the ERM is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. 'If the
franc has to devalue, then Mr Balladur's first instinct will be to devalue
within the ERM,' says one Paris-based diplomat. This would allow the ERM to
remain intact, but would require German assent to a revaluation of the
D-Mark.
That solution was left open by a statement yesterday morning from the Bank
of France. The central bank said that it excluded leaving the ERM or
floating the franc. But it said nothing about a possible realignment of ERM
currencies.
If devaluation cannot be avoided, then realignment within the ERM, rather
than departure from the system, would probably be the least damaging outcome
for the Balladur government. The French prime minister has chosen his words
carefully on the subject of the ERM and the franc. 'I am fully committed to
the stability of the franc within the ERM,' he said in a newspaper interview
earlier this month. 'I exclude today or tomorrow any other policy.'
Political analysts in Paris argue that such a policy could be consistent
with a realignment. 'He has never said as baldly as the former prime
minister that he would quit before devaluing,' said one diplomatic source.
However, others claimed that Mr Balladur is seen by the French electorate as
being so strongly committed to the current parity that any change would be
interpreted as defeat.
A devaluation of the franc would find a warmer welcome from many
industrialists. The franc's strength since September has posed serious
problems for French companies by making their exports less competitive in
countries with weaker currencies, notably the UK, Spain and Italy.
The latest external trade figures, published yesterday by the Customs
Office, illustrated the extent of the damage. The value of French exports
fell to FFr91bn (Pounds 10.36bn) in April, a reduction of 19 per cent on the
same month last year. The general economy has been sheltered from the full
effects of lower exports by a sharper reduction in imports (the trade
surplus rose to a record FFr7.65bn in April), but industry has suffered.
'We would gain a lot from a franc faible (a weak franc), because we export
much more than we import,' said Mr Philippe Messager, corporate finance
director of Valeo, the motor components group which derives most of its
sales from overseas markets. The strong franc has also diminished the profit
contribution from the foreign subsidiaries of French companies.
For some companies, however, such as Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, the
franc fort policy has encouraged industry to become more competitive. 'We
don't need a different exchange rate,' Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance
director, commented recently.
But last night, as the fate of the French franc hung in the balance, France
appeared to be in danger of a different exchange rate whether it needs it or
not.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHERE DOES THE ERM GO NOW?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION 1       SWEAT IT OUT: the Bundesbank and the Bank of France could
               defy the sceptics and decide to hold on to existing
               exchange rate parities, come what may. This would mean
               open-ended and costly intervention by Europe's central
               banks, which several ERM members might be unwilliing to
               countenance. Spain and Portugal, for example, might
               decide to withdraw sooner rather than later, joining the
               UK and Italy in floating outside the mechanism.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION 2       REALIGH: members could opt for a wholesale realignment of
               exchange-rate parities, but leave the ground rules
               unchanged. This would involve an upward revaluation of
               the strongest currencies, the D-Mark and the Dutch
               guilder and possibly the Irish punt. The French franc
               would be devalued against these strong currencies, but
               given a higher value against the other weaker ones. In
               the past, France in particular has resisted this.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION 3       RE-VAMP: a 'new an improved' ERM, including not only a
               realignment, but additional safeguards to make the system
               more durable. These could include: letting currencies
               fluctuate more against their central rate; a willingness
               to tolerate smaller, more frequent realignments; measures
               to discourage currency speculation, such as a tax on
               foreign currency transactions or the re-introduction of
               limited capital controls.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTION 4       CALL IT A DAY: Germany, France and the other member
               countries could abandon the ERM, possibly by suspending
               their central banks' obligation to keep currencies
               floating against each other and the dollar and yen. One
               possibility would be for the ERM members, minus Germany,
               to form a semi-fixed exchange rate system. The D-Mark
               could joint later, when German inflationary pressures had
               subsided.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Madrid 'needs anchor of EMS' - Fears in
Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy and finance minister, yesterday called for
weekend inter-governmental talks to stem further currency speculation.
'We cannot start off on Monday in the same way that we finished off on
Friday,' Mr Solbes said. He said the talks should be sponsored by France and
Germany.
Mr Solbes was speaking after a cabinet meeting which had reviewed cuts in
unemployment benefits to reduce Spain's expanding budget deficit. The
discussions took place as Spain began facing up to possible withdrawal of
the peseta from the ERM.
Domestic policy makers, business leaders and economists are uncertain about
what life might be like outside the security of the ERM. There are fears
that Spain, after four years of EMS membership, still requires the
discipline imposed by the system.
'Within the EMS we have an anchor that propels us towards convergence (with
the system's stronger economies) and protects us from the financial
indiscipline that would otherwise exist,' said Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman of
the state energy group, Repsol.
However, some economists argue that Spain has already cut loose from the
disciplinary anchor. The public deficit is running at around at 6 per cent
of GDP, double what it ought to be under convergence targets, and inflation
has stuck at an unacceptably high 4 to 6 per cent.
Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, chairman of the Circulo de Empresarios, a
Madrid-based business think-tank, argued it did not make that much
difference whether Spain remained in the ERM or not. 'Everything would be
fine if we had been disciplined but we haven't. We have the disadvantages of
ERM contraints and not the advantages of fiscal probity.'
The economy desperately needs lower interest rates with GDP set to fall by
perhaps 0.5 per cent in 1993 and first half statistics showing unemployment
at 22.25 per cent.
But Mr Gwynn Hatch, a senior economist at James Capel in London, argued that
the Bank of Spain could only reduce rates cautiously.
'The difference between Spain and the UK last autumn and with France now is
that Spain has not got inflation licked.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: The case for maintaining the D-Mark/franc
parity - A view from France / Personal View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIDIER MAILLARD, Chief Economist, Banque Paribas
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when the French currency is experiencing a new wave of weakness
and the commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism is under
question, it is useful to go back to both economic and political
fundamentals. These fundamentals greatly support the maintenance of the
current parity with the D-Mark.
First, the French commitment to low inflation results from more than just
the unavoidable consequence of a commitment to European construction, and
removing the link with the D-Mark would be widely interpreted as a
renunciation of this low inflation policy. Indeed, the French economy
experienced, in the late seventies and early eighties, the absence of a
trade-off between inflation and unemployment and the need for low inflation
as a pre-condition to sustainable growth and job creation.
Breaking the link with the best-managed currency over the last 40 years
would partly mean giving up once again the fight against inflation, and
would rapidly have economic costs, but also political costs. If inflation is
not a cause for street demonstrations, the French are now used to price
stability, and the prospect of an end to this stability in the context of a
currency devaluation and worst compensation for savings would undoubtedly
hit a large share of the population. Whatever the gravity of the
unemployment problem, few of those people would be convinced that the losses
they would endure were necessary to improve the job picture, and they would
be right in thinking that way.
Of course, French unemployment remains high and will continue to grow,
hitting more than 12 per cent of the workforce at the end of this year. But
core unemployment is mainly due to labour market rigidities, and monetary
easing would be of little help in reducing it. What is needed are structural
measures, which can be implemented and acted on slowly. The government began
tackling the problem by reducing employers' social contributions on less
skilled jobs and limiting the rise in the minimum wage to the minimum
increase. The government's relative prudence so far in this respect, due to
political constraints, may well be regretted.
Second, France is not in a bad competitive position, as the records of its
external balance tend to show, although it is, to some extent, helped by the
contraction in internal demand. Since the last realignment in the ERM in
January 1987, the competitive position vis-a-vis Germany has improved,
especially if unitary wage costs are considered. Global competitiveness was
naturally hit by the devaluations of the pound, the lira and the peseta
(which together amount to roughly 20 to 25 per cent of France's
competitors), but part of these moves were just a correction of
overvaluations of these currencies over the last five years. Moreover, the
impact of such devaluations is more or less offset by the rise of the dollar
and the yen.
Even if a depreciation of the franc would stimulate exports and contain
imports, it is not the key to the present problems facing the French
economy, which are a lack of confidence and excessive precautionary savings.
France's success in curbing inflation over the last ten years has
potentially led the EMS to ('two-anchor') equilibrium, as the D-Mark keeps
the benefit of the long-term credibility of price stability the Bundesbank
has built, even if Germany's latest performance is worse than that of
France. The 'two-anchor' situation means that in the long run depreciations
of one currency against the other are both equally likely and unlikely. As a
result, interest rate premiums should disappear as the expected returns in
assets of both countries should not be affected by foreseeable moves in
exchange rates.
However, such a situation may well prove an unstable equilibrium in the
short term, in the absence of interest rate spreads. This disequilibrium
will periodically put into question both the franc and D-Mark currencies on
an alternate basis, and will be sustained by news of relatively little
actual significance. In addition, this lack of stability is encouraged by
the ease and inexpensive cost of switching from one currency to the other.
Should progress be made on the future merger of currencies, we would be more
comfortable to predict a lasting stability. A renewed prospect for monetary
union, and a more concrete indication of the path to it, would help
stabilise an otherwise weak equilibrium. This would require political
progress. But even in its absence, the case for ending the ERM link is
supported neither by economic nor political reasons.

FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Jobless total sees further rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH unemployment rose by 44,600 in June to a record 3,185,000, the labour
ministry announced yesterday. The increase takes the unemployment rate to
11.6 per cent, compared with 11.5 per cent in May. The figures were largely
in line with expectations.
The gloom over rising joblessness and the currency crisis was partly
tempered by news of a slight improvement in business confidence in the
latest monthly study from INSEE, the state statistics institute.
Although sentiment remains weak, according to INSEE, there are signs that
confidence has reached its nadir. Industrial output has continued to fall,
apart from in consumer goods.
The only other positive sign was the publication of provisional figures by
the Customs Office showing that France's external trade surplus rose to a
record FFr7.65bn in April, from the previous record of FFr7.44bn in March.
However, the chief cause of this healthy surplus was the continuing fall in
imports, reflecting weak domestic demand. The value of imports fell to
FFr83bn in April, a reduction of 3.2 per cent on March and of 19 per cent on
April 1992.
Exports also continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in previous
months.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Major stands firm on plans for fuel VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday ruled out a retreat from the government's plans to
impose value added tax on domestic fuel in the wake of the Conservative
party's humiliating defeat in the Christchurch by-election.
As Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats celebrated their biggest post-war
victory over the Conservatives, senior ministers acknowledged that the
controversial tax had played a large part in the loss of the once-safe
Dorset seat. A Tory majority of 23,015 in last year's general election was
turned into a 16,427-vote Liberal Democrat margin.
Mr Major's comments came as a victory for the government in the High Court
against a challenge to ratification of the Maastricht treaty offered a
glimmer of good news on an otherwise miserable day. Lord Rees-Mogg is
considering whether to appeal but ministers are confident the judgment will
be sustained.
In an attempt to forestall a threatened Tory backbench revolt over tax
policy, Mr Major insisted that he would not be deflected from tough measures
to reduce public borrowing.
He said: 'We need to get the country down to low inflation. We've done that.
We need to get the finances right. We're in the process of doing that. We
need to make sure the country gets back into growth. That's now happening.'
The prime minister then ruled out a U-turn, stressing: 'I am not going to be
deflected from those difficult decisions. I am not going to reconsider the
policy on VAT on fuel.'
His stance did nothing to defuse opposition calls for the tax to be scrapped
or delayed, with some Tory MPs echoing demands that the second stage of
implementation - due in 1995 - should be abandoned.
Senior ministers acknowledged that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would
have to offset the impact of higher fuel costs with generous compensation
for those on low incomes and the elderly.
The by-election defeat has severely limited Mr Clarke's room for manoeuvre
in the November Budget. Some ministers are arguing that any further tax
increases must be restricted to reducing the tax allowances of those on high
incomes.
With the massive defection of Conservative voters in Christchurch rekindling
speculation about a possible challenge to Mr Major's leadership, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, led a concerted attempt to emphasise that
economic revival would soon bring a recovery in the prime minister's
fortunes. Mr Hurd admitted the government needed to do better in the way it
dealt with the difficult questions: 'We have to listen, to decide, to
persuade - and we have to improve our performance on all three.'
Mr Clarke, who reinforced the prime minister's determination not to drop VAT
on fuel, added that the government had to deliver 'competent government'
with an agenda that met the concerns of the electorate.
Mr Ashdown said that by giving the Liberal Democrats such a success the
voters of Christchurch had let out 'a shout of rage' for the people of
Britain about the government's policies.
He echoed the words of Mrs Diana Maddock, the winning candidate, to the
prime minister: 'Change your policies or get ready to change your job.'

FT  31 JUL 93 / Banks fail to stem selling despite Pounds 27bn support
operation: Future of ERM in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE of wills between currency investors and European governments was
unresolved last night after unprecedented intervention by central banks
failed to prevent further heavy selling of weak currencies.
After the Bundesbank and other European central banks spent an estimated
DM50bn to DM70bn (Pounds 19bn-Pounds 27bn) buying the French and Belgian
francs and Danish krone, all three currencies ended European trading on or
close to their floors in the exchange rate mechanism. By comparison, an
estimated Pounds 15bn was spent to support sterling last September 16, the
day it was forced out of the ERM.
International investors including pension funds, big companies and
hedge-fund speculators stepped up their selling of weak ERM currencies,
believing that the strains would soon force either a broad ERM re-alignment
or a suspension of the rules keeping the system in place.
The second consecutive day of hectic currency trading also forced a
weakening in the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo.
It largely obscured an effort by French government officials to persuade the
Bundesbank to make a more substantial cut in interest rates after its
largely technical move on Thursday.
The French authorities are believed to be trying to force the Bonn
government to choose between calling for a politically sensitive devaluation
of the franc, and exerting discreet pressure on the Bundesbank to lower
short-term rates.
'It is a trial of strength,' said one European monetary official.
In Germany, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank council member, appeared
to hold out the possibility of an escape route from the turmoil by saying
the central bank would not stand in the way if money market interest rates
threatened to fall below the central bank's 6.75 per cent discount rate.
That was interpreted as a softening in the Bundesbank's approach. Action by
the central bank on Thursday in keeping its discount rate unchanged while
cutting its less important Lombard rate half a percentage point triggered
the two days of tumult.
The intense discussions yesterday between central bankers and finance
ministry officials in Europe are likely to continue this weekend in a bid to
resolve the crisis.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister who is seeking to keep the
existing franc/D-Mark parity, reacted coolly to the day of high drama,
saying the ERM rules 'were working well'. He added later: 'France will not
allow anything to be imposed upon it.'
However, for much of yesterday's trading, the French and Belgian francs and
the krone were at their floors against the D-Mark, despite huge intervention
from the central banks.
When official ERM trading closed at 4pm in London, after which central banks
are not obliged to intervene, the French franc and krone drifted well below
their permitted levels.
After 4pm, the franc fell as low as FFr3.433 to the D-Mark, about a 1/4 of a
centime below its permitted floor at FFr3.4305. It later recovered to close
in London at FFr3.42, a fall of 0.3 centimes on the day, but eased in New
York to FFr3.429. The krone finished at DKr3.9025 to the D-Mark, weaker than
the permitted level of DKr3.9016.
France's refusal to allow a devaluation of the franc appears part of a wider
strategy aimed at pressing the Bundesbank to cut interest rates, according
to European monetary officials. They said Paris had made clear it had no
intention of calling for a general ERM realignment. Instead, it wished to
put the onus on the German central bank to prop up the franc through
intervention.
Monetary officials observed that Bundesbank interventions on behalf of the
franc risked an inflationary bloating of Germany's money supply, as during
last September's ERM crisis which led to the forced exit of sterling and the
lira.
Other officials said 'all options' for saving the ERM were being discussed
by monetary authorities in the EC.
These included proposals for widening the bands of fluctuation between the
'strong' EC currencies, but these were not on the 'front-burner'.
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance minister, said he favoured some contact
between the ERM nations this weekend. He said: 'France and Germany have to
come up with a solution to the situation since they're the ones who have
things to resolve.'
But Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, said there had been no
call from any EC member state for a meeting of the monetary committee, and
added that Belgium as current EC president would not take the initiative in
calling one.
In the UK, Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, briefed Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, on the crisis.
On the Paris bourse, investors pushed up share prices by 2.5 per cent to
their highest level for three years, in the belief that an imminent untying
of the franc from the D-Mark would allow an interest rate cut to boost
growth prospects.
The turbulence in the ERM led to substantial inflows into the dollar and
gold. The dollar closed in London at DM1.7405, up more than half a pfennig
on the day, its highest level for 23 months and closed in New York at
DM1.742. Its strength may weaken the chances of a cut in German interest
rates, because a weaker D-Mark would have inflationary implications for
Germany. Gold closed at Dollars 406.40 an ounce, a fresh high since the Gulf
War in January 1991.
In London, speculation about easier borrowing conditions across Europe
pushed the FT-SE 100 share index up 8.9 points to 2,926.5 for a 98.8 gain on
the week. UK gilts and French government bonds closed 1 point up.

FT  31 JUL 93 / VW head seeks talks with GM over espionage dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Volkswagen has asked for talks with his counterpart at General
Motors in an attempt to defuse the increasingly bitter row between the two
automotive groups over charges of industrial espionage.
Mr Ferdinand Piech had contacted Mr Jack Smith, proposing a meeting to
'discuss the matter between our concerns without influencing the legal
conflict', VW claimed yesterday.
He had also been in touch with Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics
minister, to discuss his initiative, ministry officials said. Mr Piech's
call to Bonn followed an offer from Mr Rexrodt to act as a mediator.
A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt hoped the two sides would moderate
their language, and allow legal procedures to take their natural course.
Mr Rexrodt warned both sides in a television broadcast on Thursday night to
take care not to damage Germany's reputation, as too many jobs were at risk.
General Motors officials yesterday could not confirm that VW had made
contact with Mr Smith, who is travelling during the group's two-week summer
break.
But they admitted they were surprised by the initiative so soon after Mr
Piech had been reported as saying that he would not let anyone 'pee on our
leg'.
VW spokesmen were also apparently unaware that Mr Piech had spoken to Mr
Rexrodt. They were unable to confirm that the VW chairman would renew
contacts with Mr Smith at the start of next week, as the group said in a
press release yesterday.
In an unexpected outbreak of diplomacy, Mr Piech appeared to be responding
to mounting political pressure to break the spiral of charge and
counter-charge.
He told a press conference earlier this week that he saw little hope of a
peaceful or early end to the row, which is focused on the US group's
allegations that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its former global
purchasing director, and several associates, systematically plundered
industrial secrets from GM and its European subsidiaries before defecting to
VW in March.
Describing the conflict as a 'war', Mr Piech also insinuated that GM, its
German subsidiary Adam Opel or their agents could have conspired to pervert
the course of justice by planting evidence implicating Mr Lopez and his
team.
His suggestion of talks also followed confirmation from the US Justice
Department in Washington that it had opened inquiries into the case on its
own initiative because of interest within the department in industrial
espionage in multinational companies.

MR EDMOND Alphandery, France's economy minister, yesterday said the
government would examine the impact of a change of ownership at Fnac,
France's largest books retailer.
GMF, the mutual insurance group that owns Fnac, has announced plans to sell
a 55 per cent controlling stake to Altus Finance, part of the Credit
Lyonnais banking group, and Generale des Eaux, the utility and media
concern.
However, the prospective purchasers have only agreed to take an option on
the stake and have until October to decide whether to exercise it.
Mr Francois Pinault, head of the Pinault-Printemps retailing group, has also
indicated an interest in Fnac.
Mr Alphandery said the government 'would not shirk from examining the
effect' of a change in Fnac's ownership 'whoever takes over the company'.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: DSM passes payout as profits
plummet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, posted a sharp drop in second-quarter
profits and warned that it expected a 'clearly negative' result in the third
quarter.
The company, which has been hit by the recession in Europe, omitted its
interim dividend but refused to be drawn on whether it would pay a dividend
for the full year.
Net profit in the second quarter dwindled to Fl 4m (Dollars 2.1m) from Fl
110m a year earlier, repeating a pattern set in the first quarter when
profit slumped to Fl 6m from Fl 100m.
It blamed the downturn on lower gross margins for ethylene derivatives,
captrolactum, melamine and fertilisers, as well as on lower sales volumes.
Turnover fell by 14 per cent to Fl 4.2bn.
Recession has hit demand from leading customers such as Germany's carmakers,
which account for nearly 15 per cent of DSM's annual turnover through their
purchases of engineering plastics and elastomers.
Mr Ad Timmermans, a DSM board member, said the weakness of the economy in
Europe and the traditional summer lull meant the company would fall into a
loss for the July-September period.
But Mr Timmermans said the company could make no prediction for the second
half or for the 1993 dividend.
He said the omission of the interim dividend 'provided no indication for the
final dividend,' which would be decided in February, partly on the basis of
the outlook for 1994.
In 1992, DSM cut its dividend by half after suffering a 57 per cent decline
in annual profits.
DSM's shares fell by 8 per cent at the opening in Amsterdam, but recovered
during the day to close at Fl 95.40, up slightly from Wednesday's finish of
Fl 94.50.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday underscored the improving US vehicle market and the
fruits of its profit restoration effort in North America by reporting second
quarter net income of Dollars 889m.
The figure, which worked through at 92 cents a share, compared with a loss
of Dollars 703.2m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, in the same period of last year,
when the company took a Dollars 749m restructuring charge at its GM Hughes
Aircraft subsidiary. Excluding that, 1992 earnings were Dollars 46m.
Sales and revenues were up 3.9 per cent at Dollars 36.7bn. The figures were
in line with market expectations and GM's shares slipped Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 46 7/8 in early morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
GM is in the throes of a huge cost-cutting programme in its key North
American vehicle operations, which last year lost Dollars 4.5bn on the basis
of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).
It said yesterday it was on target to achieve its aim of break-even on an
EBIT basis in North America this year. In the second quarter it made Dollars
675m, against a loss of Dollars 298m a year ago, and for the first half its
earnings totalled Dollars 1.2bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 2.49bn.
However, the second half of the year, which involves many model changes, is
usually tougher financially than the first and GM also faces potentially
difficult negotiations with the United Auto Workers over a new three-year
labour contract.
On a net income basis, its North American operations were still Dollars 95m
in the red in the second quarter, down from Dollars 761m in 1992. Company
officials acknowledged there was still a long way to go to restore North
America to acceptable profitability.
GM's share of the US vehicle market dipped to 34.8 per cent, against 35.5
per cent a year earlier. It said this was due to its strategy of reducing
less profitable sales to hire-car companies.
Its international automobile operations earned Dollars 368m, up from Dollars
284m, helped by a strong sales and financial performance in Latin America.
Its European operations were profitable, despite the severe downturn in many
continental markets, although profits were lower than last year.
Mr Rick Wagoner, chief financial officer, said the European market might be
close to the bottom. But it could bump along there for some time, with
recovery only beginning in late 1994 or 1995.
The group's financial services business, General Motors Acceptance
Corporation, contributed Dollars 285m of income, compared with Dollars 282m,
while GM Hughes Electronics made Dollars 232m, against a loss of Dollars
597m after special charges. The Electronic Data Systems subsidiary made
Dollars 178m, up sharply from Dollars 157m.
For the first half, GM recorded net income of Dollars 1.4bn, against a loss
of Dollars 21.7bn - mostly a non-cash accounting charge.

THE US Senate judiciary committee yesterday unanimously approved the
nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be the second woman to serve on
the Supreme Court and sent it to the Senate for final action next week,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The vote was 18-0 to approve Judge Ginsburg, a 60-year-old federal appeals
judge from the District of Columbia.
The full Senate is expected to confirm her before the start of the
congressional summer recess on August 6 as the nation's 107th Supreme Court
justice and its second woman member. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined the
court in 1981.
Judge Ginsburg was nominated on June 14 by President Bill Clinton to replace
Justice Byron White, who retired at the end of the court's last term.
The high court's next term begins on October 4.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Senate wrangles hit National Service scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's National Service plan has run into trouble in the
Senate with Democrats unable to break the Republican will to prevent a vote
on the measure.
The House of Representatives this week passed Mr Clinton's plan to create a
domestic version of President John Kennedy's Peace Corps, whose participants
would also earn money towards higher education.
In the Senate, however, the plan has fallen victim to the partisan wrangling
that has plagued many of the president's proposals.
The Democrats have a 54-seat majority in the Senate, but need 60 votes to
cut off debate and force a vote on the measure. Five Republicans voted with
the majority, leaving the Democrats one vote short.
The House agreed on Wednesday evening to Mr Clinton's plan to grant Dollars
5,000 a year in educational benefits in return for community service work,
with a handful of Republicans joining the Democratic majority. But it scaled
back the educational stipend to Dollars 4,725.
'National service is a bipartisan concept. . . and it is a shame to have it
treated like a political football,' said Mr Rick Allen, deputy director of
the White House's Office of National Service.
Some Republican senators, led by Ms Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, support the
concept of national service, but believe the president's plan is too
expensive. The White House has been seeking a compromise with her, so far
without success.
The president's plan calls for Dollars 394m for fiscal 1994 with no set
spending amounts for the next four years.
Mr David Durenberger, a Republican senator, and Democratic Senator Edward
Kennedy introduced an alternative plan that scaled the programme back to
three years and set spending at Dollars 300m for the first year and Dollars
500m and Dollars 700m for the next two years. Ms Kassebaum believes spending
should be limited to Dollars 200m in the first year and Dollars 400m and
Dollars 600m for the next two.
If the White House were to win Ms Kassebaum's support she would probably be
followed by enough Republicans to overcome the filibuster.
There are, however, a number of Republicans who seem prepared to block
passage of the bill at any cost. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, for example,
cites the programme as an example of 'tax-and-spend' politics of Democrats
and the president who are not doing enough to fight the deficit.
'It doesn't have to do with Clinton having victories, it has to do with the
number one problem in the country,' said Mr Larry Neal, a spokesman for Mr
Gramm.

PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday set in motion an ambitious plan to

Reuter reports from Paris.
A day after a walkabout in a deprived suburb north of Paris, Mr Balladur
pledged FFr5bn (Dollars 850m) to upgrade living conditions for France's
urban poor. The funding is to be financed by an unexpected windfall from the
government's 'Balladur bond' issued earlier this month.
A further FFr9.6bn will be spent to upgrade housing, build new roads and
provide basic public services, he said.

The IMF has approved a Dollars 98m credit for Belarus under its systemic
transformation facility, a new loan fund designed to help the countries of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to make the leap to a market
economy, writes George Graham in Washington.
The IMF said the money will support an economic programme aiming to cut the
monthly rate of inflation from 30 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the
year and limit the fall in output to 15 per cent this year.
Belarus follows Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Slovakia in drawing on
the STF, which offers less strict conditionality than a traditional IMF
standby credit agreement.

FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB deal hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours revived that BAT Industries may move to buy Hill Samuel. Sector
specialists said the speculation was feasible, considering BAT's interest in
finance via Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star. Hill Samuel is well known as being
open to sale from its parent, TSB.
One analyst said that while there appeared to be nothing visible to explain
the recent bout of rumours, it would also not be a surprising event if BAT
were to make a move.
BAT moved up 13 1/2 to 459p in turnover of 6.2m shares while TSB added 4 1/2
at 205 1/2 p in volume of 5.8m. It was also enjoying some confidence from
recent figures.
The bank sector was generally strong in line with the market hopes on
interest rate cuts. Barclays went ahead 8 to 487p and HSBC appreciated 10 to
649p, while National Westminster advanced 10 to 501p in very strong volume
of 9m.
Water shares enjoyed a bounce as investors were attracted to their high
yields. All the stocks made significant gains on the day, with Anglian,
Severn Trent and Thames Water favoured for buying by Smith New Court and SG
Warburg.
But although the premium yields, especially ahead of interest rate cuts and
with gilts performing well, make the stocks gain strength, an industry
specialist warned against letting confidence run too far in the sector. Ms
Angela Whelan of BZW said the stocks had been due for a rise as they had
recently lagged behind the performance of the regional electricity companies
and their showing was not necessarily a sign of a significant turn.
Anglian moved up 10 to 486p, Southern 22 to 512p, Severn 12 1/2 to 488 1/2
p, Thames 12 to 489p, Welsh 15 to 558p, Wessex 17 to 591p, Northumbrian 10
to 595p and Yorkshire 13 to 499p.
Pharmaceutical group Zeneca, newly demerged from ICI, produced results at
the top end of market expectations and the shares forged ahead 24 to 646p,
its highest ever level. Turnover was a hefty 8.6m.
Zeneca said sales of agrochemicals rose 10 per cent in the first half to
Pounds 825m, but trading profit fell 11 per cent to Pounds 85m, reflecting
tough competition in world markets. Total pharmaceutical sales increased by
22 per cent to Pounds 924m, with trading profit 34 per cent ahead at Pounds
302m. The market was also cheered by a better than expected dividend.
Most brokers upgraded, Smith New Court lifting its profits figure by Pounds
63m to Pounds 650m for the full year. However, the house is cautious about
the long term outlook for Zeneca and prefers SmithKline Beecham and
Wellcome. Both eased a penny to 461p and 695p respectively.
Profit-takers nibbled away at Reuters Holdings, which slipped 7 to 1432p,
losing more of the advance it made early this week on its share buy-back
programme.
Unigate's decision to sell its Arlington Motors division to Lex Service for
Pounds 49.5m was seen as positive for the dairy group and the shares
finished 8 up at 354p. The company said the proceeds would be used to reduce
debt. Lex jumped 18 to 411p.
The German cut in the Lombard rate had direct impact on those stocks with
large interests in Germany and Redland moved ahead 16 to 504p. RMC rose 11
to 797p. Following the same path was Hepworth, 7 higher at 364p. Both
Redland and RMC have enjoyed a steady climb in recent sessions on the back
of hopes over the rate cut.
Happier forecasts for the car industry rubbed off on Laird Group, which
strengthened 14 to 335p in moderate volume of 1.3m shares. The group
benefited from a growth in orders from Volkswagen, and the good results from
Ford Motor and Chrysler in the US.
GKN is inspiring investor interest in anticipation of its results due next
week. The shares rose 8 to 477p.
Similar expectation pushed up Glynwed 11 1/2 to 306 1/2 p. Its results are
also due next week.
Bid mutterings surrounded the unusually large volume of 1.2m in Excalibur,
the jewellery and engineering company, which put on 2 at 15p. One analyst
said fingers were being pointed at Suter, which owns a large stake in
Excalibur.
The recent agreement on the Manchester Ship Canal continued to benefit Peel
Holdings, which advanced 12 in a tight market to 261p.
Hopes of enfranchisement and positive sentiment ahead of forthcoming results
pushed Pifco 'A' limited voting stock up 25 to 493p. An analyst said the
company had signalled it would like to get rid of its two-tier shares
system.

FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W in demand

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Telecoms group Cable and Wireless (C&amp;W) surged as analysts returned positive
from a meeting with Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a majority stake.
Market forecasts were raised for the Hong Kong group after it told the
meeting that planned price reductions in some of its overseas markets were
being postponed to later dates.
Analysts said they now expected earnings growth of around 15 per cent,
against previous market forecasts of some 10 per cent. There were also
reports of some profits upgrades in C&amp;W as a result of the new HK Telecom
estimates.
Late trading was spiced by rumours that US telecoms giant AT&amp;T was planning
a spectacular bid. C&amp;W shares jumped 26 1/2 to 814 1/2 p in turnover of
4.4m.
There was some switching into C&amp;W from BT as investors continued to fret
over the near-term outlook. The shares slipped 2 to 415 1/2 p, as did the
partly paid, to 172p.

FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Off-licence talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation that Allied- Lyons is negotiating with Bass to buy its
off-licence chain helped both sets of shares to move smartly forward, Allied
by 12 to 570p and Bass by 9 to 482p.
The move would allow Allied, which owns the 960-outlet Victoria Wine, to
merge with Bass's Augustus Barnett chain of 583 shops. Together they would
have a turnover of around Pounds 120m, according to analysts.
Discussions between the two companies have been continuing for several
months, with Bass said to have put Augustus Barnett on the market some 18
months ago.
Industry analysts said the asking price had been around Pounds 60m, but many
believe the company would settle for nearer Pounds 45m. Whatever the price,
such a purchase would create a business to rival Whitbread's Thresher chain,
which has more than 1,600 outlets.
Augustus Barnett is thought to break even, while Victoria Wine is said to be
only marginally profitable. Both have been under growing pressure from the
expansion of the take-home trade at supermarkets.

FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Good US buying lifts ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS giant ICI outperformed even yesterday's strong stock market as it
unveiled its first set of results since its demerger. US buying was again in
evidence as it was announced that American investors now speak for nearly 15
per cent of the group's stock, up from 3.5 per cent at the time of the
break-up two months ago. The shares added 16 at 666p in turnover of 8.2m.
The reaction among London analysts was mixed, with the balance of opinion
believing the shares to be fully valued, although still a good longer term
purchase. The solid set of results were boosted by exchange rate moves,
although analysts said they were pleased at the margin growth from
cost-saving measures. The company warned that generic growth would be
hampered by the economic downturn in many of its overseas markets.
Most analysts were moving their profits forecasts up to the Pounds 300m
level following the results. However, James Capel remained a seller, arguing
that the stock was probably around 10 per cent overvalued. Kleinwort Benson
was positive but 'not chasing the stock at these levels', while Smith New
Court said it retained its 'buy' recommendation.

FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index breaks through 2,900
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON equities paused only for a moment yesterday to swallow their
disappointment at the Bundesbank's failure to deliver the expected cut in
its discount rate, and then turned strongly ahead as foreign exchange
markets signalled mounting pressures on the ERM currencies.
The FT-SE 100 Index broke decisively through the 2,900 barrier as traders
scented a possible repetition of sterling's experience last September, with
currency stresses perhaps leading this time to interest rate cuts in leading
countries in the ERM network and then in Britain. Some speculators even
suggested that UK base rates might be lowered today.
The FT-SE 100 jumped by 33.4 points to 2,917.6, its highest closing level
for more than four months and only 1.3 per cent below the all-time closing
peak of 2,957.3 achieved on March 8. The late upturn was even more marked in
the second line stocks and left the FT-SE Mid 250 Index 28.2 higher at a new
peak of 3,273.
The stock market, although firm throughout the session, hung fire for a
while after the announcement that the Bundesbank was cutting the Lombard
rate by half a point but leaving the key discount rate unchanged. The drive
forward came late in the afternoon when sterling, UK government bonds, the
US dollar and Wall Street provided impetus.
Stock index futures opened the way ahead, with the September contract on the
FT-SE 100 racing to a 20-point premium against cash, stimulating heavy
arbitrage business represented by selling of futures and buying of the
underlying blue chip shares.
The lower interest rate scenario brought share gains across a range of
issues. The UK banking sector rebounded strongly from early weakness to
close firmly ahead of the opening of the dividend and reporting season.
Lower rates in the UK would ease the burden of bad debts on the banks, and
yesterday's developments helped to offset warnings from several UK sources
that bank shares are overpriced.
Store and retail issues also improved, but in fairly restrained fashion.
Equity trading volume was good but not sensational, with Seaq volume of
691.8m shares comparing with 690m in the previous session. Non-Footsie
business slipped back to only around 58 per cent of total turn over. On
Wednesday, retail, or customer, business remained high at a worth of Pounds
1.45bn.
In the first half of the session, when equities were temporarily discouraged
by the somewhat muted action from the Bundesbank, the Footsie slipped back
after touching 2,897.4 and it seemed that the 2,900 barrier was still solid.
Pharmaceutical shares looked uncertain, with Wellcome unresponsive to an
apparently bullish report on Aids treatments. Trading results from ICI were
well received.
However, strategic concepts were largely pushed aside when currency turmoil
increased, and analysts were in no doubt that the foreign exchange markets
will call the tune in equities today. Trading screens will be manned early
as dealers assess overnight currency trading.
Mr Nick Knight, the bullish commentator at Nomura, last night reiterated his
forecast of a Footsie at 3,500 by the year-end. Some dealers warned that the
close of the equity account today could spark profit-taking.

FT  30 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets played a leading role in the strong advance in UK
equities in the wake of yesterday's interest rate decisions in Germany,
writes Terry Byland.
In stock index futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 led the
underlying market above the important 2,900 barrier, responding quickly to
evident pressures on the ERM currency network.
After showing a solid but fairly modest lead during the early part of the
session, the September contract jumped to a 20-point premium against the
underlying cash market as traders watched the developments in world foreign
exchange centres. With fair value - the estimated premium allowing for
carrying costs and dividend considerations - now at only 5 points, heavy
arbitrage dealing commenced at yesterday's peak. Both locals and the big
institutional investors were heavy sellers of the future and buyers of the
underlying stocks.
By the close, the premium had steadied to around 11 against cash (five
against fair value.) Turnover, however, was less exciting, with the contract
recording only 6,500 at the official close. The contract closed at 2,926.
Traded options saw 36,070 contracts dealt, against 32,707 on Wednesday. The
Footsie contract traded 8,112, compared with a previous 7,617. Individual
stocks were headed by British Steel (with 7,970) and Hanson (2,505).

FT  30 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying and bond rally
spur Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A BIG bond market rally, prompted by news of weaker than expected economic
growth, and heavy program trading combined to spur US share prices ahead
yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.97 at 3,567.42, less
than a point short of its all-time high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed
3.05 to 450.24, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.65 at 707.24. Trading
volume on the New York SE came to 266.5m shares.
Although the day's main economic news was not encouraging, the sharp fall in
bond yields that followed was good for sentiment. The Commerce Department's
announcement that GDP grew by 1.6 per cent in the second quarter surprised
analysts, who had been expecting growth of more than 2 per cent.
The unexpected weakness in economic growth sparked heavy buying of
government securities, which pushed the yield on the 30-year bond down to
6.58 per cent. The drop in yields delighted equity investors, who have been
worried lately by rising bond yields, and after a hesitant start it led to a
rush of demand for stocks around mid-morning. The upward movement in prices
was exacerbated by a spate of buy programs.
The gains were achieved in spite of the bad economic news (which included a
bigger than forecast 43,000 rise in weekly jobless claims), and the
disappointing overnight news that the German central bank had decided not to
lower its main interest rate.
Motor shares were firmer. General Motors added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 47
3/8 after the company announced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 889.1m, a
big improvement on a year earlier, when following a big restructuring charge
GM posted a loss of Dollars 703.2m. Ford Motor and Chrysler, which reported
stronger profits earlier this week, were markedly higher, up Dollars 1 1/4
at Dollars 53 1/4 and Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 respectively.
Insurance stocks advanced on good earnings news. American International
Group ended Dollars 3 1/4 stronger at Dollars 137 7/8 , Transamerica firmed
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/8 and Lincoln National added Dollars 2 3/8 at
Dollars 40 3/8 .
ITT appreciated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 88 3/4 after the diversified
conglomerate revealed a 152 per cent increase in second-quarter profits to
Dollars 267m.
Drug issues, which rose sharply on Wednesday on news of several major
alliances in the global pharmaceuticals business, fell back. Johnson &amp;
Johnson lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 3/4 , Merck Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
30 1/2 , Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 and Pfizer Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks extended their winning streak to four straight days, boosted
by a surge in gold shares. The TSE 300 index jumped 34.4 to 3,957.5 and
rises led declines by 448 to 269 after volume of 51.8m shares valued at
CDollars 630m.
The golds index advanced 5.4 per cent as the New York spot gold bullion
price climbed USDollars 3.75 an ounce.

FT  30 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris greets Buba news with
2.3% gain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION over the future of the ERM intensified yesterday after the
Bundesbank disappointed, surprised and baffled the markets by leaving the
discount rate unchanged.
Immediate reaction from many European strategists and analysts was not as
confused as the signals emanating from Frankfurt, which was probably due to
a split decision among Bundesbank council members.
Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley said that the Bundesbank had chosen to
focus on domestic economic difficulties rather than the wider European
vista, and that the break-up of the ERM was now likely before October.
Mr Andrew Bell of BZW believed that there was now a 55-60 per cent chance
that the ERM would be suspended in the coming days, with the reason perhaps
being portrayed as the unique difficulties of the German economy.
However, Mr Patrick Shields, a German analyst at NatWest Securities,
believed that while there was intense pressure on the franc it would hold
its course within the ERM, although French interest rates would very likely
have to rise under this scenario. He noted that a franc devaluation would be
damaging to Germany's balance of trade since France was a major export
market.
Some commentators, including Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities,
suggested that while the Bundesbank had officially 'gone on holiday' until
the end of August, there was precedent for a discount rate cut in the
interim if it became even clearer that action had to be taken to prevent the
ERM disintegrating.
PARIS gathered pace after the news from Frankfurt and the CAC-40 index
closed at its highest level since May 1992, rising 46.47 or 2.34 per cent to
2,036.00. Turnover also accelerated to FFr4.8bn from FFr2.8bn.
The market now believes that devaluation is imminent and that interest rates
will be substantially eased in the near future.
Among the day's movers were the interest rate sensitives: Peugeot gained
FFr7 to FFr636, St Gobain, FFr23 to FFr572, Elf Aquitaine FFr10.10 to
FFr426.00 and Bouygues FFr26 to FFr709.
MADRID surged to a year's high as the peseta tumbled on the foreign
exchanges, and the general index rose 4.31 or 1.6 per cent to 268.8.
'Demand picked up after the Bundesbank's announcement as people started
betting on a break-up of the ERM and the buying became quite exaggerated
towards the close,' said Mr David Joel of Madrid brokers, FG.
Buying was broadly based, with the banking and building sectors in
particular demand.
Argentaria rose Pta400 or 8 per cent to Pta5,400 in the wake of its 14.6 per
cent rise in first half pre-tax profits.
LISBON opened firmly on continued demand for blue chip issues. But, said Mr
Paulo Araujo of Schroders, the market did not react well to the Bundesbank's
action and buying slowed sharply. The BTA index finished 17.6 higher at
2,229.9.
FRANKFURT did little ahead of the council meeting and not a great deal in
the post-bourse, the DAX index closing just 0.21 lower at 1,833.70 in
turnover of DM6bn.
Commerzbank, reporting a 16 per cent gain in first half operating profit,
put on 30 pfg to DM316.00. VW remained under pressure, down DM3.70 at
DM356.00.
AMSTERDAM strengthened, the CBS Tendency index climbing 1.7 or 1.4 per cent
to 121.3. DSM which fell 8 per cent after posting a sharp fall in second
quarter profit and forecasting a disappointing third quarter, ended the day
90 cents up at Fl 95.40.
BRUSSELS rebounded late in the session wiping out losses seen im immediate
response to the German news. The Bel-20 index shed 1.66 to 1,300.01.
MILAN opened firm, with the mood helped by indications that the government
plans to press ahead with electoral reform in response to the bombings
earlier in the week. But prices gave up some of their advance and the Comit
index finished up 3.06 at 561.24.
Fiat fell L118 to L6,548 with one large seller said to be active. Telecoms
were firm as progress was seen with the privatisation programme. Sip added
L54 to L2,363 in volume of 15.7m shares while Stet added L83 to L3,896 in
volume of 7.6m shares. ZURICH eased, with profit-taking in blue chips
leaving the SMI index 8.3 lower at 2,400.6.

FT  30 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg faces up to golden
question - The rally in gold shares has been driven by offshore investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of the Liberty Life group, enjoys a reputation in
Johannesburg as an investment guru.
His announcement last week, therefore, that Liberty would raise R1bn
(Dollars 222m) by selling off 20 per cent of its strategic investments has
been cause for some concern. The reasoning is that if 'Donny' is lessening
his equity exposure to the tune of R1bn, then this is an unequivocal bear
signal.
This cautionary note comes against the background of an equity market
deprived of the certainties of the recent past when it could be assumed that
financial and industrial stocks would outperform, while gold did nothing.
The judgment calls are now much more difficult.
Whatever uncertainties the future holds, the past has at least brought a
warm glow to the hearts of gold bulls who, at last, have had cause to
celebrate after years in the wilderness. Driven by the improved dollar and
rand bullion price, the performance of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)
this year has been dominated by the 150 per cent gain in the All Gold index
to its current level of 1,988, from 786 at the start of the year.
On the back of this, the overall index has climbed some 25 per cent to
4,087, while the industrials index has hardly moved, rising only 4.9 per
cent to 4,573, from 4,359 in January.
The gold rally has been music in the ears of brokers, who have profited from
the higher turnover of shares. In June, for example, the value of shares
traded on the JSE was R3.52bn, 77 per cent higher than a year ago. This has
boosted the JSE's dismal liquidity ratio to an annualised level of 6.63 per
cent, compared with 4.42 per cent a year ago. Any investor with exposure to
gold is also sure to have prospered handsomely.
The hard question is where gold goes to from here. The JSE view is broadly
positive, although analysts are cautious not to predict the gold price
rushing ahead to Dollars 500/oz; nor do they believe the recent price
strength is a hoax about to dissolve before their eyes. Mr Rob Lee of the
Board of Executors, a financial services institution, says that given the
sort of dividend increases which can be anticipated, the current level of
gold prices can be justified.
Looking ahead, he is bullish about the prospects for the dollar price of
gold. Given an inevitable deterioration in the value of the rand - the one
fundamental all pundits seem agreed on - he believes gold shares 'will go a
lot higher than they are now'.
Given the near vertical ascent in the bullion price, and share prices, many
anticipate a short-term correction before the market moves further ahead.
Against this it is argued that the recent run in share prices has been
largely driven by US general funds. Local institutions and European
investors have been on the sidelines or selling. These investors, the
reasoning goes, may well use any weakness in share prices as an excuse to
get into the market, thus underpinning equity prices. If this is so, it will
take a sharp drop in the bullion price to crack share prices.
Certainly local institutions appear underweight in gold. Whereas the All
Gold index accounts for 10 per cent of the overall JSE capitalisation,
reports from the 23 general equity unit trusts for the June quarter reveal
that 16 of them have 5 per cent or less gold in their portfolio. These
figures confirm that the buying has been coming from offshore. JSE figures
released two weeks ago show that, following years of being net sellers of
equities, non-residents have bought more than R2bn of shares this year, most
of which will have gone into gold.
As big a headache as the outlook for gold is the high level of the
industrial market, currently on a dividend yield of 2.5 per cent. This level
has only twice been reached before: during the 1969 and 1987 crashes. The
market appears to be discounting some fairly robust profits growth, but this
is not a view supported by economic fundamentals.
Predictions for 1993 GDP growth are in the -0.5 to 0.5 per cent range and
1994 is seen as offering only modest growth prospects. Corporate profits are
thus likely to remain under pressure for some time, though the downward
trend in interest rates will offer some respite.
As for the politics, the market is either taking a very sanguine view of
negotiations, or believes that equities will be the best place to be, should
the situation unravel. In all, a better time to be a broker than a fund
manager.

help Nikkei to advance 3.2%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES finished sharply higher, with the Nikkei average registering an
advance of 627.27, or 3.16 per cent, at 20,456.85, Reuters reports from
Tokyo.
Brokers said sentiment was boosted by hopes of a rate cut and also media
reports on the likely policies of an opposition coalition that hopes to form
the next government.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 37.77, or 2.3 per cent, to
1,660.05. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.51 to 1,261.12.
After the market had closed the opposition party leaders announced that they
had selected Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as candidate for prime minister.
Parliament is due to convene next week in special session to endorse the new
prime minister.
Although the market gathered pace, many investors remained on the sidelines
and trading was mostly driven by dealers, with the recently strong yen
keeping investors cautious.
Many new investment trust stock funds are being launched in the next few
days, improving supply and demand conditions in the market.
Equities opened steady, were firmer in early trade on buying by investment
trusts, and extended gains throughout the day on arbitrage-linked buying.
The Nikkei achieved a day's high of 20,473.75 in late afternoon trade.
Turnover was about 350m shares, compared to 188m on Wednesday. Advancing
issues outscored declines by a ratio of 13-to-one, with 1,004 higher, 77
lower and 79 stocks finishing unchanged.
Nippon Chemiphar moved ahead Y120 to Y1,350 as investors thought its shares
were still undervalued.
Banks were higher on hopes of easier credit. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
appreciated Y110 to Y2,350, Tokyo Bank Y60 to Y1,730 and Sumitomo Bank Y60
to Y2,400.
NTT rose Y25,000 to Y912,000 on hopes that the new coalition government will
introduce plans to boost the NTT share price.
Mitsubishi Heavy strengthened Y18 to Y662 and Kawasaki Heavy put on Y10 at
Y419 on media speculation that they were asked to make trains using magnetic
levitation. Both companies denied the media report.
Electric power shares were firmer on the yen's recent rally. Tokyo Electic
Power ended Y100 ahead at Y3,720.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim presented a mixed picture.
AUSTRALIA closed higher but below the day's best level, helped by mounting
expectations of an interest rate cut in the wake of June trade figures, and
firm gold stocks and blue chips. The All Ordinaries index added 10.1 at
1,828.5.
Interest picked up again in Woolworths, with 7m shares changing hands. The
stock rose a cent to ADollars 2.84.
SINGAPORE was led forward by a technical rebound in Sembawang Shipyard and
light buying in some index stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index rose
12.81 to 1,807.02.
Sembawang added 20 cents at SDollars 11.10, while rumours of a share
placement helped Cerebos to rise 30 cents to SDollars 6.05.
NEW ZEALAND was propelled to another three-year high by further heavy trade
in Telecom, and the NZSE-40 capital index gained 17.34 at 1,782.31.
Telecom was volatile after reporting first-quarter profits of NZDollars
118.2m, a strong outlook for the year and a proposed share buy-back. The
stock finished 8 cents ahead at NZDollars 3.54.
BOMBAY surged ahead in hectic midsession trading, spurred by speculators and
foreign institutional investors after a victory for Prime Minister Narasimha
Rao in a no-confidence vote late the previous day. The BSE index finished 83
stronger at 2,232.67.
KARACHI continued to retreat, with the KSE-100 index losing 29.72 to
1,374.18. It was the second consecutive day of falls after a nine-day period
of rapidly rising prices.
TAIWAN finished mixed amid profit-taking after early speculative gains were
recorded on hopes of easier monetary policy. The weighted index, which rose
more than 30 points at one stage, ended just 2.99 up at 4,022.62. Turnover
shrank to a slow TDollars 13.58bn from Wednesday's TDollars 17.41bn.
Acer, which said estimated after-tax group profits rose to USDollars 16m in
the first half of 1993 from USDollars 2m a year earlier, firmed 10 cents to
TDollars 25.40.
HONG KONG finished narrowly mixed, with the Hang Seng index 3.28 easier at
6,899.93. MANILA paused after its record-breaking run and the composite
index slipped 2.63 to 1,738.34. SEOUL saw a wave of institutional selling
which left the composite index 5.82 lower at 743.21.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Day of turmoil in the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were pushed close
to their floors against the D-Mark yesterday, after the Bundesbank shocked
the foreign exchange markets by leaving its discount rate unchanged, writes
James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its interest rate floor at 6.75 per cent
came as a huge surprise to dealers, who had been led to think that an easing
in German monetary policy yesterday would help France to cut its interest
rates and ease the burden of recession.
The decision immediately led to heavy selling of non-D-Mark currencies and
concerted intervention by six ERM central banks on the most hectic day of
currency trading for nearly a year.
The French franc fell by a centime just after the news. Substantial
intervention by the Bank of France and the Bundesbank held the franc to a
London close of FFr3.417 per D-Mark, but it slipped as low as FFr3.4262
after ERM trading closed at 4pm.
The Danish krone fell below its ERM floor against the Dutch guilder at one
stage. By the close it was at DKr3.3900 to the D-Mark, fractionally above
its ERM floor of DKr3.9016.
The Belgian franc dropped to an historic low against the German currency,
and was 122 basis points below the D-Mark in the ERM grid at the close of
trading - destroying the informal 50 basis-point band that the Belgians had
declared.
Central bank intervention held the peseta and escudo above their ERM floors
but, after official trading in the system had closed, the peseta was quoted
as low as Pta82.4195, against a floor of Pta84.03.
The dollar reaped the benefits of being a safe haven in a crisis, ending at
DM1.7345 from a previous DM1.7200. In New York it closed at DM1.7395.
There were different assessments in the main London dealing rooms about the
level of intervention. One leading analyst said his bank had seen DM10bn of
support for the French franc. He claimed to have seen gigantic intervention
to support the peseta, to little effect. Other estimates were more modest -
but there was general agreement that the intervention in support of the
French franc had nearly matched the overall level of DM20bn seen last
Thursday. The Dutch central bank was said to have described intervention to
support the Danish krone as 'massive'.
There was widespread belief that the ERM would shortly collapse unless there
was a realignment of the system in the next few days. A dealer said the
showdown could come today, after fund managers had decided what action to
take overnight.
But there was lingering concern about whether to sell the French franc. Some
New York based hedge funds remained absent last night. One analyst wondered
whether the Bundesbank had left instructions for an automatic cut in the
discount rate if the franc hits its floor.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Money Markets: European rates havoc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN money markets were dazed yesterday by the Bundesbank's surprise
decision not to lower the German discount rate, writes Stephanie Flanders.
At the eye of the storm, Paris traders tried to gauge the prospects for
French interest rates in the absence of a significant German monetary
easing. French overnight money rates immediately rose to 15 per cent, while
three-month rates finished at around 8.50 per cent, 25 basis points up on
the day.
Trading in French franc futures took the full brunt of the market's
uncertainty. The September Pibor contract plummeted 20 basis points
immediately following the Bundesbank announcement, discounting the sizeable
French interest rate cuts which would follow the franc's ejection from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
September francs recovered somewhat during the afternoon, closing 9 basis
points down in Paris at 92.76. However, in after-hours' trading, the
September Pibor contract shot forward, gaining around 30 basis points in a
further bout of market confusion.
Elsewhere, the Dutch central bank announced a 25 basis points reduction in
three of its interest rates but it, too, left the key special advances money
market rate unchanged at 6.60 per cent.
Belgian money market rates rose in the face of heavy pressure on the Belgian
currency. Three-month money rates climbed to 8.25 per cent in the middle of
the day, up from the previous close of 7.80 per cent.
In London, the news from the ERM initially seemed to dampen hopes of a
pre-autumn cut in UK interest rates. But the market later seemed to decide
that the case for UK rates did not rest and fall on events in Germany.
'Even if the Bundesbank had cut the discount rate,' said one London-based
analyst, 'we would not have had a cut in Britain. Expectations have got
carried away over the past few days, but it is domestic economic and
political factors which determine the UK authorities' policy, and these do
not point to a cut before the end of the summer.'
Supporting the isolationist view of events in UK markets, trading in
sterling futures continued to reflect a belief in lower UK base rates in the
months ahead.
The December sterling contract was most dramatically affected, ending at
around 94.75, up some 17 basis points on the day. September sterling
consolidated the previous day's gain, finishing 3 basis points higher at
94.39.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold outshines silver in Peru
mining rush - Companies are ever more assiduously seeking the yellow metal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD FEVER is gripping Peru. In the face of long-depressed silver prices -
the South American country is the second largest producer after Mexico -
local mining companies are ever more assiduously seeking the yellow metal;
and joining them in the hunt is an increasing number of foreign mining
houses.
According to Mr Carlos Diez Canseco, general manager of Peru's National
Mining Society: 'Gold is what's attracting most of the foreign companies
currently visiting Peru'. Canadian, Australian and Korean interest is
especially keen, he says.
Already well ahead of the field in the gold rush is a consortium formed by
Newmont Mining of Denver, the biggest gold producer in the US and BRGM of
France, together with Peru's own leading silver producer, the Buenaventura
group. Mining is already under way at its Yanacocha gold deposit in the
north-central Andes and processing is due to commence on Sunday. It is
Peru's first large-scale dump-leaching operation and Newmont Exploration's
first venture in the country.
Yanacocha - a disseminated, low-grade deposit - is expected to produce
250,000 troy ounces. of gold a year, which will almost double Peru's output.
Proven reserve levels guarantee at least seven years' output, and Newmont is
exploring further in the surrounding area.
Usually, in leaching operations, the ore needs prior crushing. But in the
Yanacocha deposits no preparation will be necessary. Trials have established
that simple dump-leaching of Yanacocha's porous rock will allow recovery of
some 83 per cent of the ore's gold content in the surprisingly short period
of 30 days. (About 65 per cent recovery in double the period would be
considered normal).
Yanacocha's highly soluble ore averages between 1.5 and three ounces of gold
per tonne. It is planned to use the Merrill Crowe method for gold recovery,
which involves the addition of zinc powder. The end product will be 'dore'
bullion, in a mixture of 60 per cent gold, 40 per cent silver. The
consortium says it has not yet decided where, or even whether, to refine.
Development costs may total Dollars 45m - modest in relation to potential
returns. In Chile, according to one member of the consortium, a similar
project would involve three times the initial outlay. In fact, projected
profitability is such that Buenaventura has obtained a rare development loan
from a group of local Peruvian banks. Germany's state development bank DEG
and the International Finance Corporation are also expected to participate
in the financing.
Investment costs are being kept down by subcontracting all the earth-moving
to a local company in partnership with Zublin of Germany. The entire
operation will employ only about 100 workers. They will live in nearby
Cajamarca, obviating the need for camp facilities.
Newmont is spending heavily on security for the new operation. And that is
not surprising as an earlier joint project with BRGM was halted when
guerrillas invaded the mining area. But Cajamarca looks a better security
bet - the mine is only 45km by a good road from the departmental capital and
guerrilla activity is almost non-existent.
As gold enters a mini-boom phase, the long-lasting depression in silver
prices has forced all Peru's traditional silver producers to diversify.
The Buenaventura group, Peru's leading private producer, has entered into a
series of joint ventures with other mining concerns, of which Yanacocha is
only one.
Buenaventura is still heavily dependent, nevertheless, on silver. 'We're
trying to diversify, but it still accounts for around 70 per cent of our
sales, down from 85 per cent,' says Mr Roque Benavides. The group has a
small percentage in the promising Iscaycruz zinc mine, which is scheduled to
start producing in 1995 - other shareholders are BRGM, Paraibuna do Metais
and Marc Rich - and an even smaller stake in Cyprus Minerals' bid for the
Cerro Verde copper deposit, due for sale in September.
Milpo is another largely family-owned Peruvian mining company which has seen
a dramatic shift in its business in the past decade. 'In the early '80s and
at Dollars 20 an ounce, our output hinged on silver,' says Mr Augusto
Baertl, Milpo's managing director. 'But currently silver accounts for only
some 15 per cent of total sales - zinc is our main product now, lead is
second.'
Milpo, however, like most Peruvian mines, has no alternative but to keep
mining the silver - 'It's an integral part of the ore; you have to exploit
rationally everything you've got,' says Mr Baertl. 'While the silver isn't
profitable by itself, at least it adds value to our zinc concentrates.'
Milpo is involved in several gold exploration ventures, one with
Buenaventura, another with Southern Peru Copper Corporation in the region
near Peru's southern border with Chile.
If Yanacocha is outstanding for the grade of its ore and ease of
exploitation, Peru offers plenty of other gold possibilities. The lure of
alluvial deposits on the high plateau of Ananea, running down to the Madre
de Dios river basin, has already transformed thousands of peasant farmers
into gold panners - and there are prospects for larger-scale operations too.
The areas between Ica and Arequipa in the south and around Pataz in the
north are also interesting. In the Pataz area Peru's two largest traditional
gold mines, Retamas and Poderosa, are doing very nicely.
Mineroperu, the state minerals company is also offering a series of
already-studied gold deposits to private investors. These include the vast
goldfields of San Antonio de Poto, on the high Andean plateau near Puno. But
there are several smaller and more easily accessible projects that could be
attractive to the medium-sized investor.

CURRAGH RESOURCES, operating under bankruptcy protection, hopes to reopen
its two Yukon zinc/lead mines in the first half of 1994 if two big Korean
investors finally put up CDollars 50m (Pounds 26m) in new equity and the
company succeeds in getting a CDollars 34m government loan guarantee.
But Mr Clifford Frame told the annual meeting in Toronto that Curragh also
needed to restructure CDollars 200m of debt and be confident of a zinc price
of about 50 US cents a pound and a lead price of 22 cents a pound,
substantially higher than present levels.
It was Curragh's first annual meeting since an explosion in a company coal
mine in Novia Scotia in May 1992 killed 26 miners. The company faces
manslaughter charges.
Curragh has to raise CDollars 25m itself in new equity to seal the
investment by Korea Zinc and Samsung. It hopes to complete its financial
restructuring in September and emerge from protection.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME issues warning over copper
squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange yesterday reacted to widespread suggestions of
that its 'flagship' copper market, on which most contracts around the world
are based, was being manipulated to boost the price.
It formally warned market users that it was continuing to monitor very
closely the acute technical supply tightness that had developed between
September and early October and 'will not hesitate to take such steps as are
deemed necessary in the light of any changing situation'.
Mr David King, chief executive, strode on to the floor of the exchange to
remind members that LME rules gave the board draconian powers to ensure
there is an orderly market. He said later: 'We wanted to make very clear
what powers we have and that we won't hesitate to use them'.
An earlier warning on July 14 that the LME was monitoring the copper market
had little impact and yesterday's intervention also had no immediate effect.
The backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery) for September
to three months last night remained Dollars 17 a tonne.
Analysts suggested the LME's action was proof that the copper market was
being manipulated because if ordinary market forces were at play the board
would not have been so overtly concerned. One trader pointed out that market
volumes were huge so it was therefore easy to trade and for positions to be
unwound. But those behind the squeeze would probably defy the LME's
authority.
Options activity suggests those behind the squeeze are looking for copper
prices of Dollars 2,000 a tonne in September to October. Last night copper
for delivery in three months was up Dollars 11.25 to Dollars 1,965 in spite
of LME stocks standing at a 15-year peak of 463,000 tonnes.
The situation is highly reminiscent of the technical squeeze in December,
1991. That resulted in the LME board taking the unprecedented step of
limiting the backwardation to Pounds 25 a tonne a day (until recently LME
copper was quoted in sterling).
Unusual activity has kept the copper market in turmoil for much of this
year. The price fell by one quarter in only five weeks, culminating in a 5
1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,705 a tonne in May. Several LME trading houses
suffered huge losses because of that sudden and steep collapse.
Now the price has bounced back and, according to Mr Simon Hunt, chairman of
the Brook Hunt and Associates consultancy group, a 'ferocious battle is
being fought out on the LME between the copper bulls and bears'. He says the
bulls, mainly financial institutions together with one or two big metals
market players, are rumoured to have bought forward more than 600,000 tonnes
of copper.
Mr Hunt warns: 'There is a mixture of knowledgeable selling (the trade) and
ignorant buying (the institutions) which, against the background of
deteriorating fundamentals, is bound to cause copper prices to fall suddenly
and sharply at some time this year'. He says continuing high prices will
delay necessary cuts in copper output and will lead to a cumulative supply
surplus of 1m tonnes by the end of this year and one of 2.9m tonnes by the
end of 1996.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee at fresh high as cartel
talks begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON ROBUSTA coffee prices touched six months highs yesterday as Latin
American producers met to thrash out the details of their planned cartel.
The two-day meeting of representatives from Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala
kicked off yesterday in Rio de Janeiro with talks on the formation of an
Association of Coffee Producing Countries. Today the talks switch to the
plan to keep 20 per cent of eight member countries' exports off the world
market.
The coffee retention plan has been well-timed, according to the latest
coffee report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. 'Producer stocks are
low and exportable production is around or below annual international
demand, which we estimate at some 74m bags.'
Man believes that any increase in producer stocks should be matched by a
fall in consumer stocks of a similar or greater magnitude. The US Department
of Agriculture estimates producer stocks at 35m bags - lower than at any
time in recent history.
The key negative factor that the scheme needs to counter is the high level
of consumer stocks. Man estimates that a fall from 20m bags to between 15m
and 16m bags in consumer stocks would result in a the International Coffee
Organisation indicator price rising to between 70 and 80 cents a lb.
While this would require a fall in 1993-94 world exports to about 69m bags,
producers' earnings would increase by about Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 6.8bn.
The ICO indicator price has averaged only 54 cents a lb in the last 12
months. A move to between 70 and 80 cents would be equivalent to the New
York arabica market reaching 90 cents a lb and the London robusta market
Dollars 1,300 a tonne.
Last night September robusta closed at Dollars 1,013 a tonne after touching
a six-month high of Dollars 1,021 a tonne in early trading. The nearby New
York arabica contract was at 74 cents a lb in late trading.
The International Cocoa Organisation yesterday revised its 1992-93 figure
for the world cocoa deficit upwards by 31,000 tonnes to 133,000 tonnes. This
is in sharp contrast to the downward revision by ED &amp; F. Man earlier this
month to its estimate for 1992-93, from 124,000 tonnes to 96,000 tonnes.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US flood damage prompts sharp
cut in world grain forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOOD DAMAGE to US crops is cited by the International Wheat Council as the
main reason for a sharp cut in its estimate of world coarse grains
production in 1993-94.
In the latest issue of its monthly Grain Market Report the council puts
output in the coming year at 811m tonnes, compared with the 829m tonnes it
forecast in its June report and actual production of 859m tonnes in 1992-93.
And it warns that 'the figure could be subject to further sizeable revision
pending assessment of crop damage caused by flooding in the US mid-west.
However, the report raises the 1993-94 wheat estimate from last month's 560m
tonnes to 562m tonnes, which would be unchanged on last season and exceeded
only by the 1990 record of 592m tonnes. The increase is attributed to the
expectation of a larger Russian harvest.
The report also gives forecasts of world carryover grain stocks, indicating
that while wheat stocks are projected to rise by 5m tonnes to 134m tonnes
during 1993-94, the coarse grains carryover, which rose by 32m tonnes last
season, is likely on present indications to fall back by 25m tonnes to 126m
tonnes.
The IWC cautions, however, that stocks assessments, which are given 'for the
sake of completeness', can be 'liable to misinterpretation'. Officially
published national totals are rarely complete and commonly include only
officially-held stocks, it notes. And for producing areas such as China and
the former Soviet Union stock changes have to be inferred from production
and consumption figures - 'themselves only broad estimates'.
Another problem is that differing year-ends mean that actual availability
never falls as low as the aggregated carryover figure.
The council also notes that the trend towards minimising carryover stocks,
which are costly to store, through production policies like acreage
set-asides is further distorting the position. 'Land set aside or fallowed
in the major exporters can be seen as constituting another form of reserve,'
it says, 'albeit one which cannot be drawn on quite so readily as physical
stocks.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea output forecast to
recover after 1992 setback

INDIAN TEA production is likely to be close to the 1991 level this year
after 1992's heavy decline, according to J. Thomas &amp; Company's annual tea
review.
The world's largest producer suffered a major setback of 37.8m kg last year
to 703.9m kg, but the broking house believes the 1993 crop will reach 740m
kg. In the five months to May the crop totalled 182m kg, up 30m kg compared
with the corresponding period last year.
J. Thomas suggests that tea estates in south India 'may struggle' to reach
the 1991 record of 185m but says production gains in north India, including
Assam, should be 'remarkable'.
The consensus in tea circles is that the world tea production in 1993 is set
to return to the 1991 level of 2,546m kg with improved performances by the
main producers - India, Sri Lanka and Kenya.
The Indian federal government has fixed a tea export target of 210m kg,
worth about Rs12bn (Pounds 260m), for 1993, but J. Thomas says 'it will be a
significant achievement if we can achieve an export figure of around 200m
kg'. The broker's estimate appears to be more realistic as India's tea
exports declined last year by nearly 30m kg to 173m kg because of reduced
purchases by the CIS, which took only 50.3m kg, compared with 104.5m kg in
1991. The report warns that CIS demand has yet to 'settle into a definite
pattern' and that India will do well not to place too much reliance on it.
In view of its present problems the CIS is expected to restrict its buying
to the cheaper categories of tea.
Demand for Indian tea in hard currency areas will be influenced by two
principal factors, J. Thomas says. The continued ability of Indian teas to
remain competitive and 'the extent of swing in the Indian production ratio
in favour of CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea over orthodox tea.'
Gardens in north India have been particularly successful in switching to
production of CTC tea, the type favoured in the UK.
Iran, which last year bought more than 21m kg of Indian tea is expected
remain a good market, especially with the private companies there back in
business.
According to the report, traditional buyers like the UK, Egypt, Poland,
Germany and Japan should absorb larger quantities of Indian tea. Exporters
should also be able to make inroads into the Pakistani market, which imports
more than 100m kg of tea, mainly from Kenya, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Last
year India managed to sell only 1.55m kg to Pakistan.
South Africa is another country that is believed to offer good potential for
Indian tea sales.
Tea prices, which have remained strong so far, will henceforward be
influenced by the 'availability of tea' in the remaining heavy cropping
months up to October, J. Thomas says.

ALUMINIUM prices lost earlier gains yesterday afternoon as lingering concern
over production at the former Soviet Union's Sayansk smelter faded. The
market settled back into its previous restricted range with final London
Metal Exchange business at an unchanged Dollars 1,219 a tonne for three
months delivery. The TIN market seemed to be heading for a test of recent
20-year lows as the three months position closed Dollars 17.50 down at
Dollars 4,917.50 a tonne. NICKEL prices consolidated in the afternoon,
having earlier run into some overhead selling at Dollars 5,050 a tonne for
the three months position. But dealers thought the technical recovery might
yet run further towards the Dollars 5,200-a-tonne level. At the London
bullion market GOLD and SILVER prices ended little changed but the PLATINUM
price firmed another Dollars 2.65 to Dollars 409.25 a troy ounce. Traders
attributed the continued rise in platinum group metal prices to
follow-through from Wednesday's strong performance, during which October
platinum futures in the New York market forged through various resistance
levels ranging from Dollars 411.00 to Dollars 415.00 an ounce.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (12): This vicious circle must be broken -
Education and Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIALLY, Wales in the year 2010 could be one of the most prosperous
regions in Europe, but the greatest single threat to achieving that would be
the marginalisation of Wales within a marginalised UK.
That was the conclusion of a project group of the Institute of Welsh Affairs
in its report Wales 2010: Creating our Future, published in May.
Unless Wales prepared for the transformation in Europe of patterns of
employment, there would be little available other than the type of
low-skilled activity associated with the third world.
'Wales' competitiveness will depend, increasingly, on the quality of the
people who work here,' the report said, stressing that education and
training were crucially important to achieving the Wales 2010 vision.
The report by the institute, which promotes research on policy issues
affecting all aspects of Welsh life, added: 'Wales needs to break out of the
vicious circle: low achievement by too many of its schoolchildren, leading
to low level skills, leading to lower skill jobs being available, leading to
reduced incentive to train. . .' It emphasised that far higher priority
should be given to developing the skills of those already at work.
While the UK workforce in general lacks skills compared with other European
countries, it is a particular problem in Wales because so many of the skills
that do exist - from the coal, iron and steel industries  - are in less
demand or have been made redundant.
Sir Wyn Roberts, minister for Wales, has said there needs to be a big
increase in skills levels to compete with other countries. 'The success we
have had in attracting inward investment, and the performance of both new
and indigenous businesses, has shown the value of having a flexible and
adaptable workforce,' he said.
'It has also underlined the need for us to increase the supply of skills in
order to go on widening the economic base and develop a higher value-added
economy.'
Both male and female economic activity rates in Wales are the lowest in
Britain, but those for women are increasing while those for men are falling.
In 1991, only 81 per cent of the adult Welsh male population was seeking or
in work, while for women the figure had risen to some two-thirds.
In terms of people rather than percentages, it means that since 1979 there
are 140,000 fewer full-time male employees, compared with 5,000 fewer
female. Significantly, there are 54,000 more part-time women workers.
A variety of initiatives is under way to raise the qualifications and skills
of the workforce. One of the most imaginative is that of the Opportunity
Shops being opened by Mid-Glamorgan training and enterprise council to
advise people on educational and training opportunities.
Five have been opened this year, and a sixth is imminent, with a total of
nearly Pounds 1m to be invested in each of their first three years. The
concept, says Mr Allen Williams, the TEC's chief executive, 'is to spread
the message of training as widely as possible to all individuals in
Mid-Glamorgan, with the slogan of bringing learning into the high street and
putting it on the shopping agenda.'
In the first eight weeks, the Bridgend shop alone has handled more than 850
inquiries.
An important factor in raising skills is the role of colleges, and Mr
Williams says the seven colleges with which the Tec has training contracts
have become much more vocationally aware and are developing strong links
with industry.
In another initiative, Welsh Tecs in collaboration with the University of
Wales, Aberystwyth, have launched this year the Wales Information Network, a
database to allow employers to access training information on their own
computer systems.
Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the new chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, has
made it clear that he regards as vital not just the creation of jobs, but of
quality jobs. That requires employers to recognise the value of training and
Mr Williams is not encouraged.
'Employers' attitude to training is downright poor, particularly as we are
going through a recession which puts it at the bottom of their list,' he
says.
'We have considerable difficulty in persuading them that investing in people
is as important as investing in plant.'
That has to change if the Wales 2010 vision of a flourishing Wales, at the
forefront of European regions, is not to prove a mirage.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (13): Essential part of economy - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A Saturday in mid-July, the streets of Tenby in south Pembrokeshire, one
of the Britain's more charming seaside towns, are bustling with people.
The colour-washed regency houses on the clifftops look spruce and, on the
beaches below, the sands are speckled with holidaymakers enjoying the
afternoon sun. Some are even swimming. In the evening, the Mews bistro,
serving 'home-cured sushi-style Teifi salmon,' is packed with customers.
Yet there is no lack of 'vacancy' signs in the guest houses, and the
apparent well-being disguises high local unemployment. Tenby is a small
town, of only 5,000 permanent residents, but, with its neighbour
Saundersfoot, has the largest concentration of hotel and guest house rooms
in Wales after Llandudno on the north coast.
The importance of tourism to Tenby in particular, and Wales in general, is
shown by the fact that, despite the recession, which has restrained the
number of holidaymakers, those employed in the Welsh industry rose from
72,000 in 1989 to over 79,000 in 1991, more than 8 per cent of the total
workforce. But the issue now is: what type of tourism is wanted, given that
the 'bucket and spade' brigade, as at Tenby, is the most easily lured by
foreign sun?
Last year's national garden festival at Ebbw Vale attracted about 1m
visitors from outside Wales, and in the future large numbers may be drawn to
urban destinations such as Cardiff Bay. But for many visitors - the
'heritage and hikes' variety - much of the appeal of Wales will remain its
uncrowded coast and countryside.
Tourism is of especial value to these rural areas, where inward industrial
investment is hard to win. In Pembrokeshire there is the added need to
replace jobs lost by the rundown of military bases. In Haverfordwest, the
old county town, with a population of 12,000, half a dozen shops are closed
in the high street alone. Work opportunities are scarce: the Job Centre's
window has seven vacancies, five for part-time jobs such as cleaners at
Pounds 3 an hour.
With the splendour of the Pembrokeshire national park and its coastal path,
the potential to increase tourism is great. Travellers from England can
reach Haverfordwest in two hours from the Severn bridge, with dual
carriageway and motorway most of the way. They can even come by rail. But
the prime need, as elsewhere in Wales, is to have more visitors throughout
the year, rather than crowding into the peak season, and those who spend
more, which in particular means ones from abroad.
Wales has fared badly in attracting overseas visitors. There were 620,000 in
1991, only 3.7 per cent of the UK total. In contrast, Scotland had 9.5 per
cent, although many would argue that Wales offers as much in terms of
scenery and history. Its distinctive culture and language is epitomised by
the national Eisteddfod at Builth Wells, Powys.
For the first time, the Wales Tourist Board has been allowed this year to
market itself overseas separately from the British Tourist Authority  -
something Scotland has been able to do since 1984. In the US, from where
more visitors to Wales come than from any other country, the WTB has
appointed 1,200 agents. This month, promotional videos have been shown on
British Airways long-haul flights.
'We have to develop an image for Wales and make potential visitors a more
saleable proposition: not just 'Come to Wales - full-stop' but Come to
Wales. . . for a reason, such as 'Come and stay in a national park,' or
'Come and stay in a historic castle town,'' says Mr Paul Loveluck, the WTB's
chief executive.
This is in line with the board's new five-year strategy, launched earlier
this summer. The strategy report wants Wales to attract more independent and
business visitors, people taking second and short-break holidays and,
especially, overseas visitors. It believes that the number of the latter can
increase by 7 per cent a year, a much higher rate than for British visitors.
The report recognises that the non-Welsh can have a poor perception of Wales
as a holiday destination - 'We have a very good image with existing regular
visitors, who are very loyal,' says Mr Loveluck. 'But the image is not good
with people who have not been or who came many years ago. They may have
found that there were not satisfactory facilities, or sometimes the welcome
was indifferent.'
One scheme to counter this is a staff training course called Welcome Host.
'It's frustrating,' says Mr Loveluck, 'that there can be an automatic
assumption that someone on a factory line is more highly skilled and has
more status than a waiter.'
But the status of tourism is changing: 'Four years ago we had no university
department in Wales concerned with tourism,' says Mr Loveluck. 'We now have
three chairs.'
Although Wales has only a handful of top-class hotels, the standard of
cooking and variety of menu have improved. Wales musters 37 pages in the
Good Food Guide, compared with 24 pages 10 years ago.
There are now such finds as Jemima's near Haverfordwest, a tiny restaurant
where one can have elderflower spritzers, home made bread and homegrown
vegetables with local fish such as pollack. In Solva, a village tucked into
a Pembrokeshire coastal cleft, the restaurants have modish names - The Old
Pharmacy and Le Papillon Rouge. Pubs have become friendlier: 'Children
welcome' is a common sign.
Restaurants are one type of business that can apply for project aid from the
WTB, and aid is the catalyst for well-managed tourist development. Between
1987 and 1991, no less than Pounds 25m of European regional development fund
money has been allocated to tourism projects in Dyfed (which includes
Pembrokeshire), Gwynedd and Powys alone.
There are WTB schemes for improving self-catering enterprises (two-thirds of
all bed capacity in Wales), upgrading hotels and guest houses, and for
encouraging farm holidays and activity centres. Since 1988, the board has
channelled Pounds 18.7m in financial assistance to 1,256 projects, which it
calculates stimulated an overall investment of Pounds 143m.
In one project, the Pembrokeshire national park authority, in partnership
with other bodies, has worked on a Pounds 1m scheme to restore Tenby's
historic frontages. A recent initiative has been the West Wales Task Force,
launched last year by the Welsh Office to alleviate the impact on employment
of the rundown of RAF Brawdy and the naval base at Trecwn near Fishguard.
So far, the task force has helped 76 projects since it started, with Pounds
1.42m of grant. Its biggest single grant is Pounds 118,000 towards the
upgrading to 'de luxe' standard of the Atlantic Hotel on Tenby's esplanade.
Last year, a grant by the Countryside Council for Wales helped the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds to buy Ramsey island, off St David's
Head. The RSPB restricts landings to 40 people a day to minimise disturbance
to the cloughs, guillemots, kittiwakes, and the largest colony of Atlantic
grey seals in southern Britain.
There is a moral there for Wales as a whole: tourism is an essential part of
its economy, but it must not be at the expense of the environment which is
its greatest asset.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (11): Boost for women's role in the
workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURVEY of more than 300 companies in Dyfed, Powys, Gwynedd and Clwyd found
that while a third had seen an increase in the proportion of women employed
over the past five years, only one in five had seen an increase in women in
senior management, writes Roland Adburgham.
The survey was carried out for Chwarae Teg/Fair Play, a pioneering
consortium led by the public sector, which is designed to improve women's
position in the workforce.
Researchers interviewed 865 women in the four counties and found that almost
a third felt they had no skills and only 15 per cent had received any advice
on training.
Chwarae Teg, which after a pilot project in south Wales last year was
extended this year to include Dyfed and north and mid Wales, also
interviewed training organisations. It found that lack of childcare often
prevented women who wanted to take up training from doing so.
This month, Chwarae Teg urged the Welsh Office to support an 'under fives'
childcare initiative to provide 5,000 new places to help women return to the
labour market.
The kind of initiative encouraged by Chwarae Teg is that at Dewhirst
Ladieswear which employs nearly 600 people, mostly women, at Cardigan and
Lampeter. Infants come to work with their mothers and are then taken by bus
to a nursery, 'Kidz Children's Services.' They are bused back to the
factories at the end of the working day. The nursery places are heavily
subsidised by Dewhirst.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (9): Red dragon campaign is gathering pace -
Food and Drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE red dragon of Wales, long familiar at Cardiff Arms Park and other
sporting venues, is being seen increasingly in shops and supermarkets as the
campaign to promote Welsh food and drink gathers pace.
There are more than 40 organisations with varying degrees of responsibility
for the development or promotion of Welsh foods and the scale of the
fragmentation was a big factor in the creation of the government-backed
Welsh Food Promotions company two years ago to act as an umbrella
organisation.
'Our chief aim is to put Welsh food on the UK, European and international
map by developing and co-ordinating all food-related activities,' says Mr
Peter Budd, chief executive.
'What we are trying to do is create a Welsh food brand so that when people
see the Red Dragon they equate it with a quality product.'
The company, funded by the Welsh Development Agency, Wales Tourist Board and
the Development Board for Rural Wales has a brief that spans the entire
industry from the farmer and primary producer through processing, marketing,
retailing or catering, to the table.
One of the first actions was to develop a brand image in the form of the
dragon logo. Its use is being increased at displays of Welsh food so that it
can develop into a widely-recognised symbol of quality.
Until recently, Wales had a reputation as something of a culinary desert,
with recognition limited to lamb, leeks and laver bread. There is now a
growing number of international-class restaurants and a lengthy list of
specialist-quality products such as cheeses, mineral waters, confectionery
and even wines.
The challenge remains to get them better used within Wales, particularly at
catering establishments, and better known outside Wales, in the rest of the
UK and internationally. Hence the growing list of promotions and
exhibitions.
Wales, more than other parts of the UK, is typified by the large number of
tiny producers throughout the food sector. Many are too small to market
their products effectively in a retail environment dominated by
supermarkets.
The next big move is likely to be the launch of a retail shop for Welsh food
products in Cardiff. Test-marketing is under way and the shop could be open
later this year.
Although there has been an emphasis on finding new products to promote,
great progress has been made in marketing one of the country's traditional
products, lamb. As Mr Budd says: 'We are very good in Wales at producing
grass and this means we produce the best lamb.'
Seven years ago, exports of Welsh lamb were negligible, whereas now exports
to Europe are worth Pounds 50m a year and it is a rapidly-expanding market.
Welsh Lamb Enterprise, now part of Welsh Food Promotions, reckons demand
from overseas could more than double in five years. Exports this year are
already up by 40 per cent on those of 1992.
More than 600,000 carcasses will be exported to Spain this year and the
success of this campaign will form the basis of assaults on other European
Community countries, including Greece and Germany, both potentially big
markets.
The small, lean Welsh lamb carcasses are particularly popular in
Mediterranean countries and special cuts are also being developed for
France, where sales are held back because of the limited attraction of the
larger local product.
Spanish preference is for loins of lamb, while consumers in Portugal and
Greece demand the shoulder and the French and Italians prefer leg.
A new factory, due to be commissioned next year, will process local lamb
into a range of oven-ready products for the UK retail trade, thus opening up
substantial new markets at home.
Other important niche markets being increasingly exploited because of the
high added-value are spring water, speciality cheeses, organic vegetables
and even Welsh wine and whisky.
There are at least 15 Welsh bottled-water producers jostling in a
competitive but growing market, including Ty Nant in its distinctive blue
bottle, Prysg, Decantae and Brecon Beacons water.
A dedicated handfull of wine-makers across south and east Wales grow grapes
in fickle weather conditions but only one, Llanerch vineyard in the Vale of
Glamorgan, makes its own wine on the premises.
Peter and Diana Andrews, formerly pharmacists, produce more than 10,000
bottles of Cariad wine a year. Half is sold through the farm shop and the
other half to restaurants, hotels and for hospitality and corporate events.
There are a large number of cheese producers, many of whom make small
quantities of high-quality produce such as farmhouse Caerphilly, Pencarreg
and Llanboidy. However, individual marketing has led to limited success
beyond the borders of Wales because of the high cost.
Mr Tony Craske, founder of Abergavenny Fine Foods which makes a number of
specialist cheeses, believes there is a value in promoting Welsh food as a
brand.
'It can raise people's perception of Welsh produce, particularly in the
media, but ultimately we all stand or fall on the quality of our individual
products.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (8): Telecottaging as a way of life - How
rural areas are coping with change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every rural area in Europe has had to come to terms with big changes to the
structure of agriculture and the serious impact this has had on jobs and
income levels. The signs are that rural Wales is beginning to cope better
than most.
There has recently been a slow but steady expansion of population in the
region - which stretches from Snowdonia, in the north, the Brecon Beacons,
in the south, and from the coast of Cardigan Bay to the English border -
following a century of decline in agricultural employment.
In the past decade, population has grown by 7.5 per cent compared with 2.4
per cent for Wales as a whole, although the exodus of young people is still
a big worry.
The attractions of the rural heartland of Wales, which covers 40 per cent of
the principality's land area, include low commercial rents and housing
costs, a high quality of life, a good workforce and financial assistance and
business advice from the Development Board for Rural Wales (DBRW),
established by the government in 1977 to tackle the problems of
depopulation.
The area's big drawback is the widespread perception of remoteness and
isolation, even though this has been alleviated by recent improvements in
road, rail and telecommunications links, plus the assumption that industrial
activity is inappropriate so far from big population centres.
Nonetheless, progress has been impressive. In the 12-month period ending in
March this year, private sector companies announced more than 100 investment
projects worth a total of Pounds 25.7m, supporting 1,300 jobs. These capital
programmes were stimulated by a record level of Pounds 3.6m of financial
assistance from the DBRW.
The level of investment by business looks set to continue in 1993-94. In the
first quarter of the current financial year, approval has been given for
grant assistance of Pounds 1.1m for 24 private sector projects, stimulating
investment of more than Pounds 7.3m and producing 450 jobs.
Mr Glyn Davies, chairman of the DBRW, says: 'We have managed to achieve
record-breaking investment during very lean years.
'We believe even greater prosperity will be created in the years ahead.'
Another indication of the expansion of the economy of rural Wales, with its
widening manufacturing base, is the decision of the board this year to
construct only pre-let and bespoke premises rather than advance factories.
'We need to raise the quality of employment and all our current and planned
construction is for companies which meet these wider objectives. There will
be no speculative building at all,' Mr Davies says.
Projects announced in recent months include an Pounds 8.5m expansion
programme by Control Techniques, a leading producer of electronic drives and
controls, at Newtown, the completion of the new European headquarters of
Fisher Gauge, Canadian-owned specialist engineers, at Welshpool, and the
construction of a high-specification factory for Labtech, a subsidiary of
Aerospace Engineering, at Presteigne.
Mid-Wales companies have developed so successfully that 85 per cent of the
DBRW's financial assistance in the past year has gone to locally-established
businesses - 'a healthy sign for long-term rural prosperity,' says Mr
Davies.
Nevertheless, attracting inward investment remains an important part of the
board's work. In the past year, one in three of all new projects going to
Wales from the rest of the UK has decided to locate in rural Wales.
This trend should be continued through the current development of eight
small, attractively-located business parks, including ones near Snowdonia,
Cardigan, Welshpool and Brecon.
Predictably, because of ease of access and better communications, progress
has been greater in the east of the region than in the far west, and added
emphasis is now being placed on attracting more jobs to Cardiganshire and
Merioneth, where agriculture has been particularly dominant.
Farm diversification projects have received help and advice and the DBRW is
seeking to develop a variety of locally-based activities, either divorced
from agriculture or giving added value to agricultural products.
Many small-scale industrial, high-tech and advisory activities can be placed
in rural areas, providing more varied employment opportunities and helping
to retain a working population across a full range of age and ability.
A potentially-important provider of employment is telecottaging, which
offers training and equipment to enable people to work in or close to their
rural base.
In essence, a telecottage is a workplace and trading centre in a village,
filled with computer and communications equipment that can be used by local
people, businesses and community groups.
As well as providing low-cost training in high-tech equipment, the
telecottage offers electronic office services to small businesses and
teleworkers, including accounting, spread-sheeting, desk-top publishing,
electronic mail, fax and photo-copiers.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Telecottages Wales and an organiser of a
telecottage at Llangedwyn, an old mill complex on the borders of Powys and
Clwyd, believes the potential for local rural employment is considerable,
particularly when proper quality standards are set, so that employers have
confidence in the system.
'The cost of work here must be a twentieth of what it would be in a big
city,' he says.
Mr Davies does not regard telecottaging as a significant factor in boosting
local employment yet, but he believes this will change.
'The benefits of telecottaging are going to come in the longer term by
ensuring that the rural population, particularly the young, have complete
familiarity with new technology,' he says.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (7): High tech has replaced the smoke stacks
 -Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON

<TEXT>
FEW things epitomise the new face of industrial Wales better than the
arrival of Robert Bosch outside Cardiff two years ago to produce a new
generation of alternators for the motor industry.
The Pounds 100m investment was new; the product was new; the end markets
were new. For the German company, motor equipment is the most important part
of its Pounds 5.4bn business and it had decided to locate its most advanced
factory in a country that was once best known for its heavy industries -
coal, steel, engineering, chemicals and metals.
'We chose Wales,' says Dr Kurt Liedtke, managing director of the company's
British arm, 'because the site was close to the M4 motorway, the ports of
Cardiff and Southampton and because we wanted to be close to the new motor
manufacturers such as Nissan, Toyota and Honda which have set up in the UK.
'South Wales has a history of industrial excellence and so Bosch knew its
employees would have the necessary technical skills which could then be
further developed through re-training programmes.'
If Bosch is a leading example of the new industrial Wales it is far from
being the only one. Almost across the road from its plant, British Airways
has built the largest hangar in Europe to service its Boeing 747 Jumbo
fleet. Electronics, motor parts, food processing, pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology abound. High technology has replaced the smoke stack
industries of the past.
In case it be thought that the new Wales is only based in the south, the
little town of Newtown, in mid Wales, is home to Control Techniques, one of
the fastest-growing producers of variable-drive motors. Hamilton Brothers is
building a gas and oil plant at Point of Ayr in Clwyd. Euro/DPC is making
medical diagnostic products at Llanberis in the shadow of Snowdon. And
Toyota has an engine plant at Shotton.
'The process of attracting new industry has resulted in a transformation in
Welsh business and industry over the last 15 years,' says Mr Ian Kelsall,
Welsh director of the Confederation of British Industry.
'An enormous number of new jobs has been created and there has been a very
large expansion in manufacturing industry in the country.'
One newcomer is Ascom, subsidiary of a Swiss concern whose Pounds 1.5bn
annual turnover puts it among the larger producers of telecoms equipment in
Europe.
'We started in Cardiff in 1985,' says Mr Payl Moirano, marketing director,
'with a workforce of 100. It's now up to 300 and we are still recruiting.
The plus factors are a flexible labour force, good labour rates and a
workforce with an ability to learn new skills. Employment costs in Wales are
very competitive against those anywhere else in Europe.'
Mr Keith James, chairman of Eversheds Phillips and Buck in Cardiff, and a
director of the Bank of Wales, says that the 'Welsh economy has been
transformed to one with an above national average proportion of
manufacturing. Manufacturing now accounts for 27.3 per cent of Welsh gross
domestic production whereas the UK figure is only 22.4 per cent.
'Success in attracting big export-oriented names such as Sony and Panasonic
means Wales is increasingly integrated into the European and world economy.'
Today, more than 25,000 people work in electronics, a figure overshadowed by
the 70,000 in the financial-services sector. Financial services, with the
arrival of concerns such as National Provident Institution, N M Rothschild,
Axa and D C Gardner have been one of the cornerstones of the new growth.
Even those older industries which remain have played their part in the
regeneration of Wales.
Coal may no longer be more than a bit player in the economy, with just four
pits employing about 1,000 people where once a quarter of a million worked
underground. But steel, even if its numbers are drastically reduced, still
has a leading role.
The industry now employs some 14,600 where once there were more than 85,000.
But its production lines at Newport and Port Talbot are among the most
efficient and most profitable in Europe, while the coated-steel plant at
Shotton is a market leader.
The tinplate works at Troestre and Ebbw Vale are producing a new can opener,
the Ecotop, a twin-button opener to replace the ring-top, described by Mr
Brian Sims, an executive at Newport, as 'a significant new development in
beverage packaging. Instead of having to pull the ring, you just push two
small buttons.
'The product has been developed by us in conjunction with Hollands's
Hoogovens and Germany's Rasselstein and has been accepted by Sainsbury's. It
illustrates the international nature of our business.'
Two academics at the Cardiff Business School, Mr Stephen Hill and Ms Julie
Keegan, have pointed to a 'Welsh manufacturing renaissance,' showing how the
long-term decline in industry has been reversed in Wales. In a paper, Made
in Wales, written for the CBI, they state that 'Wales started the 1980s with
relatively low levels of manufacturing output and with manufacturing making
a lower-than-average UK contribution to regional GDP.
'By the end of the decade the Welsh manufacturing position had been
transformed. Manufacturing had grown faster than the UK average so that it
now makes a higher-than-UK-average contribution to regional GDP.'
That renaissance has been stimulated to a great extent by the arrival of
inward investment, much of it from overseas but a large amount from
elsewhere in the UK. 'Attracting new investment in Wales, environmental
improvements and helping small and medium-sized companies to grow will
continue to be our key priorities,' says Mr Phil Head, chief executive of
the Welsh Development Agency.
Dr Gwyn Jones, until June chairman of the WDA, adds that in the five years
of his chairmanship 'The agency has more than doubled the rate of inward
investment projects and tripled the associated capital investment. Wales is
now seen as the leading UK region for winning inward investment and we are
much feared by our European competitors.'
The last word on the transformation comes from Mr Kelsall. 'The new industry
and the new arrivals have resulted in a general improvement in standards.
When the Japanese first came to Wales just over 20 years ago they could not
get the the sort of quality supplies they wanted from local manufacturers.
'Their presence has helped to bring about a very considerable rise in
standards among existing producers. That is of immense benefit to the
economy as a whole.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (6): Time-saving benefit for inward
investors - Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWYNEDD, the north-west corner of Wales that is forever Cymru, has a new
benefit to offer inward investors - the time taken to travel from the
Britannia Bridge across the Menai Straits at Anglesey to the county's local
airport.
The airport, which handles 13m passengers a year and runs daily scheduled
services to Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and two to New York, is the
fastest growing in Europe and is at Manchester.
Mr Brian Rees Jones, the Welsh Development Agency's regional manager for
North Wales, this month did the journey twice with an American businessman
to prove it was no fluke to accomplish it in an easy 75 minutes.
This is new. The journey was always hindered by a depressing bottleneck
across the River Conwy on the border with Clwyd where traffic crawled and
queues lengthened each year in the summer.
In 1991, however, a tunnel under the river solved the problem. Apart from
two near-completed sections of only a few hundred yards each, it is now
motorway or dual carriageway all the way from Bangor to London, Liverpool,
Leeds, Manchester or Hull - and the ferries to Europe are less than four
hours away.
'Manchester Airport is now our local airport,' says Mr Eurwyn Lloyd Evans,
director of economic development and planning for Gwynedd County Council.
'We only wish they would realise this in Cardiff.'
He is referring to the Welsh Office, which frequently stresses the
convenience of Cardiff's airport - from where a feeder service flies to
Manchester - in its promotional material for Wales in general. Gwynedd is at
least four hours away from it.
Completion of the A55 road from Chester to Anglesey has cost about Pounds
600m over a couple of decades. Gwynedd has felt an immediate benefit.
In 1991-92, the county attracted 23 projects in terms of inward investment
or expansion. It is already certain to equal the figure this year. The
comparison with previous years is startling: Mr Jones says the annual
average had been stuck at five since the mid-1980s.
The road emphasises what has always been true about North Wales - its
infrastructure runs west to east and its regional economic affinities are
with north-west England. This is where many of the companies Mr Jones is now
courting are based. Others are in the Republic of Ireland and, because of
the airport, the US.
'Our greatest asset is now the A55. Linked to that, we have also got our act
together to exploit it. The A55 has opened up this area and focused all our
minds on what we want to do,' he says.
The WDA, county council and Targed - the training and enterprise council for
the area - are developing a strategy aimed particularly at sectors such as
food and drink, health care, broadcasting and the media.
Mr Huw Vaughan Thomas, the county's chief executive, has forged particularly
close links with Targed, to help ensure that training delivers the sort of
multi-skilling that will provide the right sort of adaptable, flexible
workforce.
He has culture on his side: two-thirds of the 240,000 population are fluent
Welsh speakers who, by tradition, have always valued education. Mr Thomas
says Gwynedd has more than half of Wales's A-level passes in information
technology.
'We need more professional and technological activities to retain more young
people in Gwynedd,' he says. Too many still migrate elsewhere in Britain for
work. He says unemployment rates of about 12 per cent remain his biggest
problem, especially since they rise to 20 per cent in parts of Anglesey and,
in winter, in the Lleyn peninsula.
Recent inward investors such as Thistle Trading, however, are very happy
with what they have already. Thistle employs 70 near Bangor, making
sweat-shirts, tee-shirts and boxer shorts for Marks and Spencer and will
soon be taking on 36 more.
The project is an expansion by Abbey Textiles of Nuneaton. Mr David Reardon,
Abbey's managing director, says availability of labour, plus a Pounds 15,000
training grant from Targed, made him choose Gwynedd rather than Derbyshire,
the Black Country or South Wales.
Mr Maurice Reynolds, an Irishman, who is managing director and co-owner of
McIntosh Reynolds, Anglesey's abbatoir, is particularly pleased with the
infrastructure. His is the only EC-approved slaughterhouse in North Wales.
The A55 now ensures easier journeys in and out.
He has exploited this by selling genuine Welsh lamb - guaranteed so by being
both reared and killed in Wales - to Asda in particular. The company has
invested Pounds 350,000 recently and has Pounds 2.5m set aside for more
improvements. It can process as many as 20,000 sheep a week and 1,500
cattle.
The link to the airport is proving particularly valuable to Austin Taylor
Communications which makes cable installation equipment and telephone
connection components opposite the old Penrhyn slate quarry at Bethesda.
The company, which was one of North Wales's first inward investments in
1947, nearly foundered recently after diversifying into switchboard
equipment and coming unstuck against the giants of the industry. It is now
part of Communications Systems of Minneapolis.
Mr John Hudson, the managing director, uses Manchester's Chicago service
regularly, as do his US colleagues. The company is coming back strongly in
niche markets, employing 130 and exporting 30 per cent of its sales, which
are at Pounds 6m a year and growing.
Meanwhile, infrastructure improvements are begetting others. Stena Sealink
is beefing up its Dublin-Holyhead services with new high-speed ferries that
will cut journey times by 100 minutes to less than two hours, so as to
exploit the A55.
Mr Thomas says tributary roads will soon open up the Lleyn, and he wants
improvements to Holyhead town centre - and its road to the Britannia Bridge
made a dual carriageway - to prevent bottlenecks on Anglesey.
Tourism is also being boosted, with ease of access encouraging more
day-tripping from Ireland as well as north-west England.
Even the by-passed town of Conwy is doing better. People now go there to
visit its impressive castle and quaint quayside, not for a traffic-jammed
ordeal.
The local barometer is a tourist attraction on the quayside which claims to
be the smallest house in Britain - it is 72 inches wide, 100 inches deep and
122 inches high; people queue to go in one at a time and mount the stairs to
view the tiny bedroom.
Ms Margaret Williams, an author and journalist who inherited the house from
her father, says trade was 25 per cent up last year and is performing well
this summer.
Hers is not the only traditional Gwynedd business to be doing well out of
the county's history. Alfred McAlpine's Penrhyn slate quarry recently had a
repeat order it is particularly proud of: it was from Harvard University,
which wanted to match the last slate it ordered from Bethesda 150 years ago.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (3): Waiting for the bonanza - Oil and gas
strike brings fresh hope for Clwyd economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE county of Clwyd in North Wales has struck oil
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or rather a consortium of Hamilton, Lasmo and Monument Oil has struck gas
and oil in Liverpool Bay, a few miles off the Clwyd coast. What Clwyd hopes
for, long term, is a bonanza.
Most believe it cannot come quickly enough, for some aspects of the local
economy are on what Paul Roberts, head of economic development at Clwyd
county council, says is a 'knife-edge.'
Clwyd lost about 10,000 jobs with the closure of much of the Shotton
steelworks more than 10 years ago. It was close to clawing most back through
inward investment and growth, but in 1991 lost 1,200 more at United
Engineering Steels at Brymbo, near Wrexham.
Meanwhile, continuing recession in world aviation markets means dangling
uncertainty for British Aerospace, which employs 800 people on executive
jets and 3,000 on airbus wings in the county.
Inward investment brings jobs, but usually not many at a time. For example,
when Amcor, a packaging company, recently decided to set up a corrugated
cardboard factory in Clwyd, it brought in only a tenth of the jobs lost with
the Brymbo steelworks closure.
What Clwyd needed therefore was something to give it a big leap forward and
attract clusters of new investment. The newly-discovered oil and gas fields
of Liverpool Bay look like providing it.
Indeed, for all the trumpeting of Toyota's decision to locate its engine
plant in Clwyd near the now highly efficient strip-processing remnants of
Shotton steelworks, Hamilton's discovery is widely expected to prove much
more significant.
Toyota will eventually create about 300 jobs - about 100 people have been
taken on already - and although this should lead to more among component
suppliers, many will not be local. Exploitation of Liverpool Bay looks like
offering bigger local prospects.
Gas is to be piped ashore to a terminal at Point of Ayr, on the tip of the
Dee estuary. Oil will be removed directly from the field by ship and in the
early stages at least will bring no direct benefit to Wales. The gas will
involve initial developments costing Pounds 1.2bn.
From the terminal, gas will be piped about 15 miles to Connah's Quay, near
the Queensferry border with England, there to fire a 1,350 MW, Pounds 580m
power station which GEC Alsthom is building for Powergen.
Go-ahead for the entire development came in the spring after more than a
year of delays. First, conservationists on both sides of the Dee estuary
objected to the terminal, which will be near a nature reserve.
A public inquiry cleared the way for David Hunt, then Welsh Secretary, to
approve the terminal in February, but by then the pit closures debate had
seen the electricity generators' 'dash-for-gas' put on hold, so the power
station was stalled.
The first contracts were finally let at the end of May after the project was
eventually cleared by government. Work on the Pounds 60m terminal has
started, with immediate knock-on economic effects.
AOC International has the contract but associated civil engineering works
are being done by David McLean Contractors, which is based in the Clwyd town
of Flint, creating 700 local jobs immediately.
A total of 3,000 construction jobs are expected overall, with the first gas
reaching Wales in 1996. Although the project will leave only 200 permanent
jobs, Mr Roberts expects Clwyd to be in position to exploit what should be
some attractive industrial infrastructure.
'We hope to attract to the region energy-intensive projects which can take
advantage of such abundant supplies of gas and electricity. We think this
might give us the basis for building good, long-term jobs.
'In the past we have played the numbers game. We have tried to retain
employment as jobs drained away through closures by attempting to attract
labour-intensive industries. We are now developing a base that should prove
attractive to companies looking for higher skills, where people will be able
to earn higher wages,' he adds.
This is critical for male jobs in particular. Clwyd's male unemployment rate
is 14.7 per cent - nearly three times worse than that for women, currently
5.3 per cent.
Redressing this imbalance would go some way to counteracting one of Wales's
perpetual problems - a low gross domestic product per head relative to other
parts of Britain. What Clwyd is hoping to get from new high technology
industry is better value added in manufacturing, higher wages, and a more
widely multi-skilled workforce with better local spending power.
The local professional infrastructure to back this up is developing. Mr
Peter Richards, senior partner of Clement Jones &amp; Co, a firm of solicitors
based in Holywell is sure the Liverpool Bay developments will stimulate
growth across the board.
A native of Crickhowell in South Wales, he joined the firm in 1973 after
university and articles in Liverpool. He has since expanded it to 14 offices
 -eight in Clwyd, four in Gwynedd, and two in Cheshire - with more than 100
employed, including 30 fee-earners, including six partners. He claims his is
now the biggest commercial law firm in North Wales.
Clwyd as a county is aiming for 25,000 new jobs by the year 2000, split
equally between services and manufacturing. It also wants at least 500
export-focused companies by then.
Not all of the old world has been swept away, however. There is one working
coalmine left - ironically, at Point of Ayr. It has survived the coal
closure review, although with only half its former complement of 470 men.
Clwyd's leaders fought as hard to save it as they did for the gas terminal
and power station which, many believed, threatened the pit's doom. However,
the two fights were parallel, not inter-dependent, for the colliery's market
is Fiddler's Ferry power station at Widnes on the banks of the Mersey, about
30 miles away. The old and the new look like co-existing for some time.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (2): Private sector role is crucial -
Regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the centre of Merthyr Tydfil stands a large notice. Redevelopment of the
shopping heart of the town is being undertaken, the board states, by
Chesterfield Properties in conjunction with the borough council assisted by
the Welsh Office and an urban grant.
The Merthyr project is only one of more than 30 town-centre schemes being
undertaken across Wales. Nearly all of them are partnerships between the
public and private sectors. Urban regeneration has become one of the most
important parts of the work being undertaken by the Welsh Development
Agency, which is quietly in the background of the Merthyr scheme.
'The essential characteristic of the programme is that it should be seen as
a joint venture' says Mr David Farnsworth, director of the agency's urban
development department. 'We are attempting to bring all sides together for
the benefit of the areas involved.'
A record Pounds 30m is being spent this financial year, Mr Farnsworth says,
in towns ranging from Holyhead in the north to Barry in the south, from
Milford Haven in the west to Caldicot in Gwent and Wrexham in Clwyd in the
east.
Some are large: at Holyhead, capital investment of Pounds 3.31m is being
undertaken while Merthyr has been allocated Pounds 3.2m.
Elsewhere the sums may be relatively small: Pounds 150,000 in Pontarddulais
to develop the town's proximity to the M4 motorway or Pounds 200,000 in
Conwy to make part of the centre a pedestrian precinct, improve the flow of
traffic through the historic town and improve parking for the thousands of
visitors who flock in during the summer.
The urban programme is geared towards investment in those places which have
the potential to become growth sectors of the Welsh economy.
'We bring together public and private finance to create greater value and
enhanced quality of investment,' Mr Farnsworth says.
'The involvement of the private sector is crucial because this is just as
much a partnership as that successfully launched by the agency a couple of
years ago to produce more investment in the property sector.'
Although there have been urban development schemes undertaken in Wales for
some years, a co-ordinated programme did not really get under way until 1990
with the arrival of Mr Farnsworth at the agency's Cardiff headquarters.
In 1990-91 the WDA put just Pounds 4.8m into urban regeneration, which was
supplemented by Pounds 5.8m from the private sector.
This year the agency will pump in Pounds 30m which should attract another
Pounds 60m from the private sector and in 1994-5 the agency's budget is
planned to be Pounds 35m while it expects the private sector to put in
Pounds 120m.
'Between 1990 and 1995 we expect some Pounds 240m of private-sector money to
have been levered in the Welsh economy,' Mr Farnsworth says.
This spending is not just on new shopping centres or traffic-management
schemes.
Landscaping and new infrastructure work is taking place this year in
Llanelli; business development projects are being pursued in the Cynon
Valley; and tourism facilities are being improved in Holyhead.
There is land reclamation at Barry; dockside redevelopment at Caernarfon;
improved car parking at Caerphilly; a new access to a superstore site will
be built at Pontypool where there are plans to make the canal more
attractive to visitors; and an indoor market and the De Valence pavilion
will be redecorated at Tenby.
'Large or small, these are all seen as enhancing the growth potential of
their areas,' says Mr Farnsworth.
The biggest of the joint-venture schemes is taking place at Swansea, Wales's
second city. Swansea has already undertaken a large amount of new
investment, building a barrage across the river Tawe, a marina and maritime
quarter, an enterprise park and a hotel, all with official support from a
variety of quarters.
Over the next five years it expects to invest about Pounds 27m from the
public sector alone on improving the city's accessibility, its traffic
management, clearing sites, attracting hotels, smartening property, and
building houses, offices and factories.
The city believes this will attract Pounds 200m by the year 2003 which could
lead to another 6,700 jobs being created directly and a further 4,500
indirectly.
Plans such as this have led to the European Commission taking a close
interest in the way Wales is managing its urban programme. 'We are
attempting to change traditional approaches,' Mr Farnsworth says.
'The traditional management of towns has been to spend money on a problem
when it arises. But towns are too complicated for such a simple approach.
'We are seeking now to make opportunities the most important factor. Instead
of taking a departmental approach such as any borough director would do, we
are looking at a town's economic needs and finding the most satisfactory
solutions.'
Earlier this year Mr Farnsworth and his team were asked by the European
Commission to discuss their methods. Brussels officials are keen to see how
the Welsh approach to public-sector management can be used elsewhere in the
Community.
It is one way in which the Welsh approach is leading Europe.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (4): A community created from the slag heaps
/ Profile of Victoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ebbw Fawr valley, on the edge of Ebbw Vale in Gwent, was within living
memory a Hades of a steelmaking mill, collieries, slag heaps and railway
tracks, crossing a land contaminated with red furnace dust, writes Roland
Adburgham.
The steelmaking ended in 1978; the collieries closed, and the land was
reclaimed, at a cost of Pounds 20m, for last year's national garden
festival. The festival, the last in a series of five in the UK, attracted 2m
visitors and encouraged those who came from outside Wales to realise that
the old image of the valleys was outdated.
The big question, though, was what should happen after the festival closed
last October. Would the steeply sloped site, with its thousands of planted
trees and shrubs, be allowed to decay into an unkempt wilderness?
Instead, the area was planned to have a full 'after use', with the parkland
retained and a village named Victoria, with business and industrial units
providing local jobs. To achieve this, the Victoria Partnership has been
established - a joint venture between the Welsh Development Agency, Blaenau
Gwent borough council and Gwent county council.
Today, construction equipment is making access roads, and the first of 500
homes have been completed and sold by Redrow. Meanwhile, gardeners look
after the festival's tropical plant house, the lake and 60 acres of
ornamental gardens and woodland.
Mr Robert Croydon, of King Sturge, property consultants to the partnership,
says:
'There were three objectives: to arrest migration from the heads of the
valleys, with people moving away because there were no quality homes,
environment or jobs; to bring back people who had already moved away to the
coastal belt; and to encourage people to come who had no prior connection
with the area.'
Nealon Tannon, a Bristol firm of architects, was chosen to design the
village centre of Victoria Green with small shops and a family pub.
Around it will be a mixture of houses for rent and sale and, nearby,
self-build homes. There may be sheltered accommodation and a nursing home.
'We are trying to get a balance between young and single people and the
elderly,' says Mr Croydon.
Sculptures and four of the festival pavilions have been kept for such uses
as a church and a village hall.
To provide jobs, there are business and technology parks, alongside the
recently built regional headquarters of Welsh Brewers.
The festival at its peak employed 2,000 people, some of them redundant
miners and steelworkers. Long-term, it is hoped there may be about 1,000
jobs created by the shops and business parks.
Victoria is due to be completed by the year 2000, when it should be possible
to judge whether a genuine new community has been created out of the
slagheaps of the past.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (1): Next test - a cultural revolution / A
more fundamental change than an urban facelift will be for Wales to move
from the employee culture, created by large state-owned industries, to an
entrepreneurial culture
</HEADLINE>

THE VIEW is distracting as you cross the Severn Bridge into Wales. Seaward,
in the middle of the estuary, concrete caissons are in place. Soon there
will emerge - like the sword Excalibur in Arthurian legend - the main pylons
for the new Pounds 300m bridge. They will be 137 metres high.
The second Severn crossing, which is being built by Laing-GTM - and
privately financed - is not scheduled to open until 1996, but it is a
striking example of the infrastructure investment benefiting Wales.
In the north, the upgrading of the A55 road link with England will be
completed next year at a cost of Pounds 650m.
Although parliamentary approval of the Cardiff Bay barrage bill has been
delayed, contractors have already been invited to tender for the Pounds 152m
project.
Mr Peter Kelly, regional chairman of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers,
says: 'With a barrage, Cardiff will be propelled into the forefront of
European cities as a property location.'
In spite of such schemes, construction output in the principality slumped by
19 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, compared with the year before. But
overall Wales has found this recession less traumatic than some other
regions. The housing market has seen much smaller falls in prices than in
south-east England.
There have been heavy job losses - nearly 500 at Trawsfynydd power station
in Gwynedd and 370 at a Port Talbot cigar factory were announced only 10
days ago - but the rate of unem- ployment, 10.2 per cent in June, has at
long last fallen below the national average.
An unfortunate consequence is some downgrading of assisted area status under
the new plan announced last week, even though male unemployment remains
above the national rate.
'The recession has hurt and hurt a great deal,' says Mr Ian Kelsall,
director of the Confederation of British Industry in Wales.
'There are many scarred businesses and we have lost a lot of small
businesses. But Wales has survived better than some other regions because
the industrial base has been rebuilt over the last 10 years.'
The latest quarterly surveys by the CBI and Wales Chamber of Commerce and
Industry show that businesses are still cautious and reluctant to make
commitments on capital expenditure until they are sure the recovery is well
established.
However, Wales is seen as being among the first of the UK regions to come
out of recession. Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster
Bank, forecast last month that between 1994 and 1998 Wales would be one of
the fastest-growing regions. Cambridge Econometrics this month forecast that
the principality would have growth of 1.8 per cent this year and 3.6 per
cent next year.
The growth will be from a relatively low base. 'Even though Wales may have
fared better than elsewhere during the recession, it has had to come from a
long way back,' says Mr Graham Hall, lead executive of the Wales chamber.
The GDP per head is lower than anywhere except Northern Ireland and wages
last year averaged Pounds 271 a week, the lowest in Britain.
This is not to minimise the structural change that has taken place. Wales
has been transformed from an economy dependent on coal, iron and steel to
one in which new industries, especially inward investors, have enabled the
manufacturing sector to retain a quarter share of GDP, higher than the UK
average.
There are more than 350 foreign-owned concerns around which 'clusters' of
indigenous businesses can develop and raise their own standards.
'Productivity has improved and unit wage costs are now among the best in the
UK,' says Mr Kelsall.
Among the big investments this year has been British Airways' maintenance
hangar at Cardiff Wales airport, scheduled to be opened by the Prince of
Wales today and which will employ as many as 1,000 by 1994.
The value of regional selective assistance in stimulating investment was
emphasised last April by Mr David Hunt, then Welsh secretary and now
employment secretary.
'It has been a great success in encouraging job-creating projects in Wales,'
he said.
During the previous two years, companies had received more than 390 aid
packages, worth nearly Pounds 150m.
The aid has not helped the Conservatives to gain electoral ground in Wales.
In the 1992 general election, Labour's share of the vote was 49.5 per cent,
giving them 27 seats, compared with the Tories' 28.6 per cent and six seats,
only two more than Plaid Cymru. But Mr Hunt's successor, Mr John Redwood,
defending the redrawn assisted areas map, said it continued to cover the
majority of Wales's working population and almost all of the main business
locations.
Mr Redwood, while valuing inward investment, believes that more needs to be
done to encourage home-grown businesses, innovation, and the substitution of
imports of everything from cheeses to domestic appliances.
He would like to see more companies with their headquarters in Wales and the
strengthening of Cardiff as a financial centre to encourage this.
If it is a time of transition at the Welsh Office - with the arrival of Mr
Redwood and next week of Mr Michael Scholar from the Treasury as permanent
secretary, and at the Welsh Development Agency with a new chairman - so it
is with the local authorities.
Mr Redwood is pressing ahead with plans to replace the two-tier structure
with unitary authorities by April 1995.
Despite political differences over such issues, the public sector and
private sectors show a willingness to work together, often lacking elsewhere
in the UK, to accelerate projects such as urban regeneration.
A more fundamental change than an urban facelift will be for Wales to move
from the employee culture, which was created by large state-owned
industries, to an entrepreneurial culture.
The structure of employment is reshaping, with the numbers of male employees
steadily falling and those of part-time women workers and self-employed
rising. But Wales is still seen as an immature market for the risk and
growth capital needed to develop home-grown businesses.
Mr Nigel Guy, director in Cardiff of 3i, the venture capital group, says:
'The boost of inward investment can put a veneer over business and economic
life in Wales. There are very few second or third generation businesses.'
He calls for a sea-change in the way companies look at themselves. 'We need
a switch in emphasis to make entreprenuerialism more respectable.'
The Institute of Welsh Affairs, in its report: Wales 2010: Creating our
future, says that small and medium-sized enterprises will be crucial in
meeting the ambitious growth targets which it believes are possible.
'To achieve its enterprise culture, Wales needs nothing short of a cultural
revolution.'
Having survived the recession, that may be the next test for Wales.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Traders stunned by Bundesbank failure to
cut discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, PATRICK HARVERSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement yesterday that the German central bank was not prepared to
cut its key discount rate stunned the European government bond markets,
which had factored in a reduction of half a percentage point.
German government bonds surged on the news, judging the move as a boost to
the Bundesbank's credibility in what is increasingly being seen as a battle
of wills between speculators and central banks. Bund futures for September
delivery traded 35 pfennigs higher at 96.26.
French debt prices jumped on the belief that the franc would have to either
realign within the European exchange rate mechanism or decouple and cut
rates independently. As the franc tumbled, the 10-year Notionnel futures
contract rose 30 centimes to 120.48 and hit 120.80 in after-hours dealing.
Spanish government bond futures traded in Barcelona gained half a point to
93.25.
However, Ecu bonds fell sharply, with the Ecu bond futures contract traded
on the French Matif tumbling 32 basis points to 114.48.
Dealers had spent the morning gazing at their screens as they waited for the
Bundesbank to make an announcement. Barely anyone was prepared to trade, and
those that did found it difficult to get a price, particularly in the
usually-liquid bund futures market, which saw only 12,000 contracts traded
by the early afternoon.
Then, at 1.15pm GMT, the Bundesbank announced it was leaving its discount
rate, which sets the floor for bank lending, unchanged at 6.75 per cent. It
also said its next securities repurchase agreement rate would be fixed at
the existing 6.95 per cent, a clear signal that the tight monetary policy
will continue.
The only sop was a half-point cut in the upper-level Lombard rate, to 7.75
per cent.
Mr Wiltse Bailey, an economist with Banque Nationale de Paris, said reports
of the death of the ERM were exaggerated. 'French base rates can be held at
8.4 per cent, so the small- and medium-sized companies who have had the most
problems will not be affected by the rise in overnight rates,' he said.
'There may be some increase in tension and further tests on Belgium and
Denmark, but the ball is in the market's court now. For the Bundesbank,
there was a credibility question over giving in to market pressure following
the latest data on M3 and inflation. It has refused to buckle and it is a
battle of wills now.'
After a meeting which lasted nearly four hours, the German central bank put
out a curt press statement detailing the changes it was making. It said:
'This measure . . . continues the policy of cautiously reducing interest
rates.'
As always, it refused to comment on the way the voting went, and said no
council members were available for comment.
While the meetings are shrouded in secrecy, a few of the 16 council members
have hit out at further rate cuts against the background of higher money
supply growth and inflation.
Most significantly, Mr Johann Gaddum, vice-president designate of the
Bundesbank, said last week that if the M3 money supply figure was outside
the target range of between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent, there was no justification
for a rate cut. His comments were made just before M3 for June came in at
7.1 per cent.
OUTSIDE the increasingly strained ERM, UK government bonds continued to
soar. Gilts shrugged off any supply worries following Wednesday's Pounds
3.25bn auction of eight-year stock and ignored the potential shock wave from
the Christchurch parliamentary by-election.
Gilt futures for September gained more than half a point to test record
highs at 109.
ITALY, also outside the ERM, saw its government bond futures contract shoot
0.80 higher to 105.71.
AUSTRALIAN bonds reached a new high in response to the second-quarter
current account deficit, which came in at the bottom of expectations.
The long end performed most strongly as inflationary pressures remain low.
August 2003 T-bond yields crashed through 7 per cent to 6.90 per cent,
pushing prices up by more than a percentage point.
AN UNEXPECTEDLY weak second-quarter gross domestic product report, and a big
rise in weekly jobless claims, provided a firm boost to US Treasury prices
yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 3/32 at 107
3/16 , yielding 6.568 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 4.118 per cent.
Trading was heavy.
The eagerly-awaited GDP numbers delighted bond traders and investors. The
1.6 per cent rise in GDP was well below market forecasts, which had been
looking for growth of 2.2 per cent. Sentiment was also buoyed by the news
that the implicit price deflator, a closely-followed measure of inflation,
rose only 2.6 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 3.3 per cent in
the first three months of the year.
Prices, especially at the long end, rose sharply after the data was
released. This was because market participants believed the unexpectedly
weak second-quarter growth would definitely rule out any chance of an
interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. Only last week, Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had predicted second-quarter GDP growth of at
least 2 per cent, and had warned that rates might have to go up if inflation
picked up too strongly.
Treasuries were also aided by a larger-than-expected 43,000 rise in weekly
jobless claims, and by a report in the Washington Post that the Fed had not
eliminated the possibility of a cut in interest rates.
GREECE is raising the rate on its one-year dollar-linked drachma bond to
4.25 per cent from 4.10 per cent, Reuter reports. The rate on the three-year
dollar-linked drachma bond will rise to 5.80 per cent.

THE New Zealand Futures &amp; Options Exchange, acquired by Sydney Futures

Australian market, AP-DJ reports from Wellington.
Plans will now proceed to allow trading on New Zealand futures contracts in
Australia. The link is expected to increase liquidity in local futures
trading. A survey of Sydney exchange members shows that between 15 and 20 of

Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of the Sydney exchange, said extra liquidity
from Australia and further afield would help the New Zealand financial
market use futures and options on futures to manage risk.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: ISMA calls for reduced period
of settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Securities Market Association has described a reduction in
the Euromarket settlement period, to trade date plus two to three working
days from trade date plus seven calendar days, as 'both necessary and
justified', Reuter reports.
ISMA said it prefered the trade date plus two days settlement option. ISMA's
full board and market practices committee has been discussing the matter
since its annual meeting in May, when members voiced strong support for such
a move.
Cedel and Euroclear, the two clearing houses, say they foresee no technical
problems with the proposed shortening of the settlement period.
ISMA said a shorter settlement period would reduce overall systemic risk,
bring the Euromarket more into line with the cycle for domestic debt
instruments traded internationally, and help members to meet capital
adequacy requirements.
The date set for the changeover is January 1995.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Investors seek sterling safe haven from
ERM storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING-denominated new issues provided the main focus in the international
bond market yesterday, with investors scrambling for sterling assets against
a backdrop of continued turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut only its Lombard rate by half a point,
while leaving the discount rate unchanged, sparked further turbulence in the
foreign exchange markets. Sterling, which remains outside the ERM, attracted
interest from investors because of its perceived 'safe haven' status at such
times.
SBG, or Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft (Deutschland), the wholly-owned
German subsidiary of UBS, launched an unusual structured deal with a total
price tag of Pounds 259.25m.
SBG is issuing a series of 27 different zero coupon notes, with maturities
staggered at six-monthly intervals from September 30 1993 to the final
series (No 27) maturing on March 31 2006. The first 26 note issues are for
Pounds 6.125m with a final, 27th, note of Pounds 100m.
UBS, lead manager, said it chose this structure in response to strong
investor demand for sterling-denominated zero coupon instruments. 'There's
good demand for sterling assets from continental investors because of the
currency play, and zero coupon bonds provide them with a leveraged play,' it
said. The bonds also held tax advantages for certain investors.
The zero coupon bonds are backed by semi-annual coupon payments from SBG's
holding of a Pounds 100m issue of BT bonds, which have a 12.25 per cent
coupon and mature in 2006.
'This is basically a way of creating zero coupon bonds off the back of a
normal coupon bond as the cash-flow from the BT bond interest payments
received by SBG will be used to pay off the zero coupon bond,' said a senior
official at UBS. UBS originally bought Pounds 229m of BT debt, selling part
and retaining Pounds 100m to do a structured transaction.
The other sterling deal of the day was a Pounds 56.25m convertible issue by
Witan, the largest investment trust managed by Henderson Touche Remnant. The
bonds can be converted into a basket of shares in three separate investment
trusts managed by Henderson, and in which Witan has shareholdings.
Baring Brothers, book-runner for the deal, said the convertible bond route
provided a tax-efficient way for Witan to sell its shares in the three
investment trusts.
The bonds were launched at par and were quoted at between 100 (bid) and
100.5 (offered) by late afternoon. Baring Brothers said the bonds were
bought mainly by private client fund managers, as well as institutional fund
managers in the UK and Europe.
Meanwhile, Skopbank, the central bank for Finland's savings bank group,
launched a Dollars 100m floating-rate note with the coupon set at six-month
Libor plus 50 basis points, giving investors an overall yield of Libor plus
61 basis points.

ITALY'S financially troubled state holding company IRI has agreed to sell
its 62 per cent stake in its frozen foods and sweets manufacturer Italgel to
the Swiss food group Nestle for L1,550 a share, or a total of L437bn
(Dollars 272m), AP-DJ reports from Rome.
The Italgel sale is IRI's first large privatisation since the government
said last year it would embark on a major asset sales programme.
But IRI's decision was only half a success as it failed to conclude the
simultaneously planned sale of its canned food unit Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica.
IRI rejected all bids received for Cirio as 'incomplete, conditional and
insufficient' and said it would now seek a buyer through private
negotiations.
It had arranged an international competitive auction for the two food
companies, previously owned by its food and retail holding company Societa
Meridionale Finanziaria (SME).

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: ITT registers 152% jump in net
income
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in ITT rose yesterday after the diversified US conglomerate reported
a 152 per cent jump in second-quarter net income to Dollars 267m following
improved performances from all but one of its eight main business lines.
Group sales rose slightly to Dollars 5.5bn.
The news lifted ITT's shares on the New York Stock Exchange to Dollars 89
1/4 , a new 52-week high, before closing Dollars 1 3/8 up at Dollars 88 3/4
. Investors appeared untroubled by a warning from Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's
chairman, that some of the group's markets would 'soften' in the second half
of this year.
ITT's latest results were affected by special items, including a Dollars 13m
restructuring charge, a Dollars 50m provision to cover the losses on early
retired debt, a Dollars 63m gain on the sale of its unsecured consumer loan
business, and Dollars 25m of capital gains in the group's insurance
portfolios.
Among ITT's businesses, its financial and business services group put in an
especially strong performance. Operating results at the insurance unit, ITT
Hartford, improved dramatically, with earnings jumping from Dollars 41m a
year ago to Dollars 187m this year. This followed a drop in catastrophe
losses, favourable underwriting results, higher capital gains and the
absence of losses relating to its Cameron and Colby business.
Better results from its commercial lending business lifted ITT Financial's
earnings 15 per cent to Dollars 75m. The only unit in the financial and
business services group to report a decline in income was ITT Communications
and Information Services, where foreign exchange losses led to a small drop
in earnings to Dollars 66m.
In the manufactured products division, earnings at ITT Automotive jumped
Dollars 20m to Dollars 54m as material and overhead costs fell. ITT Defense
and Electronics also reported sharply higher income at Dollars 18m, as did
ITT Fluid Technology. Both units benefited from improved cost control.
ITT Rayonier, the forest products operation, reported doubled income to
Dollars 50m.

<TEXT>
BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, incurred a second-quarter
loss of CDollars 520m (USDollars 406m), equal to CDollars 1.77 per common
share, after absorbing its share of a USDollars 940m writedown by 52 per
cent-owned Northern Telecom.
The loss was in line with analysts' estimates, following last week's news
from Nortel that its second-quarter loss equalled USDollars 4.13 a share,
including the writedown.
BCE recorded a 1992 second-quarter profit of CDollars 246m, or 72 cents. Its
consolidated revenues in the latest quarter were CDollars 4.92bn, against
CDollars 4.98bn, mostly from Bell Canada.
BCE's first-half loss was CDollars 299m, or CDollars 1.13 a share, against a
profit of CDollars 544m, or CDollars 1.60 last year.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merck seeks a new drugs formula
 -Richard Waters examines implications of the Medco takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are two ways of looking at the proposed takeover of Medco Containment
Services, the US's biggest drugs distributor, by Merck, the country's (and
the world's) largest manufacturer of pharmaceuticals.
It could be a straight grab for market share by Merck in the face of
fast-falling margins on prescription drug sales. Or it could be the
beginning of a process of vertical integration in the healthcare field,
leading to a more efficient delivery of drugs to users, bringing down
overall healthcare costs and improving the effectiveness of treatments.
There is no doubt which of these interpretation Mr Roy Vagelos, Merck's
chairman, was putting on his company's Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco,
announced on Tuesday.
A revolution in drug provision is about to reshape the industry in the US
and elsewhere, he said. The beneficiaries will be the users of drugs and the
governments, corporations and others who are increasingly the ones who foot
the bill.
Hospital admissions which result from misuse of drugs, duplicate treatments
and the prescribing of excessive dosages together waste around Dollars 15bn
a year, Mr Vagelos said.
By creating a closer link between the patients, doctors, hospitals,
pharmaceuticals companies and the people who pay for drugs, the Merck/Medco
link would make the provision of drugs more efficient. Medco's contribution:
a database on customers and drugs usage which is unrivalled and which would
take Merck years to duplicate, said Mr Vagelos.
Merck's vaunted claims for the takeover were directed in part at Washington,
which could yet decide that the takeover violates anti-trust law.
They also reflect an attempt to reassure two other powerful groups: Merck's
competitors, whose willingness to supply drugs to Medco at discounted rates
have accounted in part for that company's success, and Medco's customers,
who rely on the distributor to find them the most suitable and cheapest
products in the market, whoever the manufacturer.
The market for anti-ulcer drugs could provide a litmus test for the future.
A Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn market in the US, it is dominated by Glaxo's
Zantac, which accounts for Dollars 1.5bn of the sales. SmithKline Beecham
has its own contender, Tagamet, which sells Dollars 500m a year, while Eli
Lilly has Axid, whose sales reach Dollars 150 to Dollars 200m.
Merck's own drug in this category, Pepcid, has sales of Dollars 400m. Will
Pepcid now become the standard anti-ulcer drug recommended by Medco? And
will Glaxo and others take pre-emptive action by reducing the discounts they
give Medco on their products?
Both sides expect Medco's buying of Merck products to rise from its current
Dollars 250m a year (or 9 per cent of Medco's total purchases.) Any
increase, though, will result not from a desire to push Merck drugs, but
from the fact the link-up would lead to Merck drugs becoming better
designed, or better priced, to suit Medco customers, said Mr Martin Wygod,
the distributor's chairman.
The stock market's interpretation of Tuesday's announcement was rather more
down to earth than the vision outlined by Mr Vagelos.
By paying Dollars 6bn, Merck was diluting its earnings per share by 6 to 7
per cent, analysts said. The market was less clear about the benefits of
integration, and a share price fall of Dollars 1 3/8 on Tuesday was followed
by another Dollars  1/4 yesterday, to Dollars 30 1/2 at the close.
The prices of all the big US pharmaceutical groups also lost ground on the
news, which seemed to threaten an extra twist to the price war which has hit
pharmaceutical company shares in recent months.
Pressure on drugs prices - caused not by the proposed health care reforms of
the Clinton administration, but by a push by big drugs buyers to cut their
bills - has driven pharmaceutical companies' shares down in recent months.
Discounts of up to 25 per cent are becoming familiar. According to Mr Viren
Mehta, an analyst at New York-based Mehta and Isaly, some Dollars 4bn of
Merck's sales come from six big products. Each competes with similar drugs
from other companies (in the jargon of the industry, they are 'me-too'
drugs') and so is vulnerable to severe discounting. A 25 per cent cut in
these sales would wipe Dollars 1bn off Merck's turnover.
Meanwhile, the shares of other drugs distributors rose on the news, buoyed
by a belief other big manufacturers would feel impelled to protect their
distribution channels.
The trouble is, Medco stood head and shoulders above its competition: it is
estimated to account for half the market in mail-order sales, and to account
for as much as 10 per cent or more of all bulk-buying of drugs.
Both competitors and customers were digesting the news yesterday. Big
customers like General Electric said it was too early to say whether they
would need to reconsider their links with Medco.
Competitors, meanwhile, complained privately of the arrangement - though any
retaliatory action would damage their own businesses, cutting them off from
one the US's biggest distributor.

PLACER DOME, one of Canada's two top gold producers, has reported lower
second-quarter earnings because of a decline in gold production and lower
realised prices.
The June quarter's sales dipped 10 per cent to USDollars 234m, reflecting an
8 per cent fall in gold sales volume and lower realised prices for gold,
copper and molybdenum.
Net profit, including investment income, amounted to USDollars 21m, or 8
cents a share, down from Dollars 24m, or 10 cents, a year earlier.
Gold output totalled 453,000 oz, against 505,000 oz, and the average cash
cost of production was up slightly to Dollars 191 per ounce.
First-half profit was USDollars 32m, or 13 cents a share, against Dollars
35m, or 15 cents, after special gains of Dollars 13m, against Dollars 7m.
Sales revenues were Dollars 447m, against Dollars 507m.
Gold output was 903,000 oz, a fall of 6 per cent, while cash cost of
production was slightly lower.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: McCaw narrows deficit to Dollars
22.1m in second period
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MCCAW Cellular Commun-ications, the largest cellular telecoms company in the
US, yesterday announced a narrowing in second-quarter losses to Dollars
22.1m, as net revenues from cellular operations climbed 28 per cent to
Dollars 313.6m. In the same quarter a year ago, McCaw incurred a restated
loss of Dollars 65.8m.
The fast-growing, heavily indebted business said that cellular subscriptions
continued to grow strongly in the quarter, rising 31 per cent to 2.5m by the
end of June. The increase boosted cashflow 32 per cent to Dollars 189m, and
was achieved in spite of a well-publicised health scare about the use of
cellular phones.
Mr Craig McCaw, chairman and chief executive, said that while current
opportunities in the cellular business were unparalleled, there were further
investments in the technology to be made.
LIN Broadcasting, another cellular telecommunications company that is
majority-owned by McCaw, also announced growth in cashflow and subscribers
yesterday. Net revenues in the quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 185.4m,
and cash flow from cellular operations climbed 21 per cent to Dollars 90.4m.
Like McCaw, LIN carries a heavy debt load, and net losses in the quarter
totalled Dollars 16.6m, up from a Dollars 12.7m loss a year ago.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Decline at Xerox is steeper than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
XEROX, which issued a profits warning in May, yesterday unveiled a
sharper-than-expected decline in second-quarter earnings from its core
document processing business.
For the three months to June 30, Xerox net income fell to Dollars 112m, or
96 cents a primary share, from Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.12, a year
earlier.
Income from the core document processing business fell to Dollars 111m, or
95 cents, from Dollars 124m, or Dollars 1.12, last year. Revenues slipped to
Dollars 3.54bn from Dollars 3.55bn the previous year.
Xerox warned investors in May to expect an earnings downturn. Its shares
then dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 . The stock was Dollars 1 1/4
higher at Dollars 73 5/8 at the close yesterday. Most analysts had expected
earnings of about Dollars 1.03 a share.
Xerox blamed some of its problems on the unexpectedly lengthy process of
reorganising its sales force and the ensuing disruption. It said earnings
were hurt by weak European economies and an unconvincing recovery in the US.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, said: 'The economic environment in both the US
and Europe is causing customers to scale back spending on office equipment'.
Document processing gross margins fell in the quarter, reflecting a shift
towards low-end products with lower margins, pricing pressure and
unfavourable currency translations.
Mr Allaire said Xerox would strive for earnings growth for the full year.
But he noted the European economic environment would probably remain soft in
the second half.
First-half net income was Dollars 301m, or Dollars 2.73 a share. A year
earlier, the company took charges of Dollars 764m for accounting changes
which contributed to a loss of Dollars 405m, or Dollars 4.56. Income from
document processing edged 4 per cent higher in the period to Dollars 236m
from Dollars 227m. Revenues were Dollars 6.84bn, against Dollars 6.86bn.

PANCANADIAN Petroleum, one of Canada's top three natural gas producers and a
key affiliate of the Canadian Pacific group, doubled first-half net profit
as it gained from two years of heavy investment in oil and gas production
First-half profit was CDollars 122.5m (USDollars 96m), or 98 cents a share,
against CDollars 58.3m, or 47 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars
549m, against CDollars 418m.
Second quarter per-share earnings were 49 cents against 31 cents and
revenues for the quarter advanced to CDollars 282m from CDollars 218m.
The company said the second half would bring more gains in oil production
and the outlook for gas was good with the prospect of further price rises.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the biggest US brewer, posted essentially flat
second-quarter net income on sales which edged 1.3 per cent higher, and said
it would raise its quarterly dividend by 12.5 per cent.
For the 1993 second quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 308.6m on
sales of Dollars 3.43bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 308.4m on sales
of Dollars 3.38bn a year earlier. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 4.7
per cent to Dollars 1.11 from Dollars 1.06. There were fewer shares
outstanding in the latest quarter.
The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend on common
stock to 36 cents a share from 32 cents.
First-half net income was Dollars 502.7m, or Dollars 1.80, against Dollars
446.8m, or Dollars 1.54, last time on sales of Dollars 6.3bn against Dollars
6.41bn. Last year's earnings included charges of Dollars 76.7m for

of more cuts

UAL, parent of United Airlines, yesterday revealed better-than-expected
second-quarter earnings of Dollars 22m, or 54 cents a share. But it noted
the results were still far from satisfactory and warned that further
cost-cutting measures were necessary.
The net income compared with a loss of Dollars 91m, or Dollars 3.80, in the
same period of 1992 when vicious domestic fare wars and the effects of
recession hurt the entire industry.
At the operating level, UAL had earnings of Dollars 84m, compared with a
deficit of Dollars 93m a year earlier.
Operating revenues rose to Dollars 3.55bn from Dollars 3.14bn, while
operating expenses were 7.1 per cent higher at Dollars 3.46bn.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, described the results as 'clearly unsatisfactory.
While considerable progress was made on a relative basis on cost reduction,
long-term viability in the domestic market requires substantial further
reduction in unit costs'.
Earlier this month, UAL's three main unions said they would make substantial
wage concessions in exchange for a large equity stake in the company.
Mr Wolf said the revenue performance continued to reflect fare discounting
on domestic and North Atlantic routes as well as continued weak demand in
the Pacific.
United's cost per available seat mile fell 3.8 per cent to 9.09 cents in the
quarter, largely as a result of a Dollars 400m annualised cost-cutting
programme which started earlier this year.
United's yield - passenger revenue per mile flown - rose to 12.30 cents in
the second quarter from 12.14 cents a year earlier. Its load factor averaged
67.4 per cent, against 67.3 per cent the previous year.
For the first half, UAL suffered a net loss of Dollars 115m, or Dollars 5.38
a share, excluding a one-time charge for debt retirement. A year earlier,
UAL lost Dollars 199m, or Dollars 8.33, excluding the impact of accounting
changes. Operating revenues for the first half rose 12.6 per cent to Dollars
6.88bn, while operating expenses were 8.5 per cent higher at Dollars 6.92bn.

<TEXT>
WALT DISNEY, the US entertainment group, reported a 10 per cent improvement
in underlying third-quarter net income in spite of a significant loss on its
investment in Euro Disney in the quarter.
The company warned that Euro Disney expects to post a loss in the fourth
quarter, which would affect Walt Disney's fourth-quarter results.
The investment in Euro Disney resulted in a loss of Dollars 30.9m in the
quarter. Its equity share of Euro Disney's loss was partly offset by
royalties and other income related to the investment.
Stripping out new accounting methods for pre-opening costs, the investment
in Euro Disney would have resulted in a loss of Dollars 48.8m in the
quarter.
Walt Disney's income for the quarter to June 30 was Dollars 259.1m, or 48
cents a share, compared with Dollars 220.8m, or 41 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 3.2 per cent to Dollars 1.94bn.
Stripping out the impact of accounting changes, net income rose 10 per cent
to Dollars 242.7m, or 45 cents, in the latest quarter while operating income
was 14 per cent higher at Dollars 477.2m.
For the first nine months, Disney's net income fell 36 per cent to Dollars
377.6m, or 69 cents, including accounting changes. A year earlier, it earned
Dollars 593m, or Dollars 1.11. Stripping out accounting changes, net income
rose 19 per cent to Dollars 707.9m, or Dollars 1.30. Revenues hit a record
Dollars 6.35bn.

HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
yesterday reported a slight increase in first-half pre-tax profits to
NKr782m (Dollars 106.4m) from NKr757m, but said it may double the dividend.
'The board will consider increasing the dividend per share for the current
financial year by up to twice last year's distribution, bringing the payout
ratio into line with other pharmaceutical companies,' Hafslund said.
The company paid a total of NKr2.20 a share last year.
Group sales improved by NKr175m to NKr2.793bn for the six months, following
an increase in royalties to NKr361m from NKr72m. Operating expenses
increased by NKr34m to NKr1.797bn.
Operating profit fell by NKr101m to NKr741m, including research and
development costs of NKr361m against NKr341m last year.
However, Hafslund said that operating profit - once it had been adjusted for
the shipping business spun off last year into a separate bourse-listed
company - had risen by 2 per cent.

AIG's net income for the period rose to Dollars 481.6m, or Dollars 2.27 a
share, up from Dollars 419.6, or Dollars 1.98, a year ago.
Revenues climbed by nearly 11 per cent, to Dollars 5bn.
Pre-tax profits in the general insurance business rose by 14 per cent to
Dollars 332.4m, before capital gains, while pre-tax earnings in life
insurance climbed 17 per cent to Dollars 180m.
Transamerica's second-quarter net income was up at Dollars 123.9m, or
Dollars 1.49 a share, from Dollars 97.5m before losses from discontinued
operations, or Dollars 1.17 a share, the year before on revenue up from
Dollars 1.2m to Dollars 1.3bn.
Most of the earnings growth was generated in the group's life assurance
side, where net income jumped from Dollars 47.4m to Dollars 75.7m.
Growth in assets, cost control and higher spreads accounted for profits
growth of more than 10 per cent in life assurance, structured settlements,
living benefits, group pensions and reinsurance, Transamerica said.
Net income for the first half was Dollars 215.7m, or Dollars 2.57 a share,
compared with Dollars 168.6m, or Dollars 2.05, before losses from
discontinued operations in the first six months of 1992.
Transamerica's shares ended the day at Dollars 56 1/8 , up Dollars 1 1/2 ,
while AIG's shares rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 137 7/8.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Kirin cuts forecast for
full-year profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KIRIN BREWERY, Japan's biggest beer producer, expects profits to fall this
year, despite a 7.9 per cent increase to Y34.62bn (Dollars 326.6m) before
tax for the first six months.
The company has cut its forecast for parent company pre-tax profits to
Y80bn, down from the Y82.70bn it made for 1992 and the modest rise to Y83bn
it had earlier projected for 1993.
That had been based on an assumed 3 per cent growth in beer sales, which
Kirin now says has evaporated. Volume shipments have fallen, and revenue
from the beer division edged ahead 0.4 per cent in the first six months. An
unseasonably cool and rainy July will affect the second half.
Income is also thought likely to be affected by Kirin's temporary suspension
of advertising following the arrest this month of senior executives on
allegations of paying up to Y33m to sokaiya, racketeers who disrupt
shareholders' meetings unless their financial demands are met.
Yesterday, the board accepted the resignations of Mr Hideyo Motoyama, the
chairman, and two other managing directors, who are taking responsibility
for the scandal. Although leaving the board, they remain advisers.
An earnings fall this year would be the second in a row for Kirin, which is
labouring under economic downturn as well as the high capital costs of
opening new breweries - meaning an extra Y5.8bn in depreciation charges for
1993.
First-half revenues rose 1.1 per cent to Y616.5bn, helped by a strong
contribution from pharmaceuticals.
Net earnings per share, Y13.88 at the interim level against Y13.18, are
expected to emerge at Y35.15 for the year, compared with Y35.6. Kirin
intends to maintain a dividend of Y10, of which Y5 is being paid for the
first half.

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, has bounced back to profit
during the first six months, helped by securities gains, increased net
interest income and a reduction in credit losses.
The bank's operating profit, after credit losses, was NKr348m (Dollars
47.4m) for the six months to June, against a loss of NKr131m previously. Net
profits totalled NKr324m, compared with a loss of NKr162m.
However, Christiania warned that problems in the fisheries industry - to
which it has loans of NKr8bn - had forced up credit losses to NKr381m in the
second quarter, from NKr261m in the first three months.
At the end of the second quarter, gross non-performing fisheries loans
reached NKr2.2bn, while exposed commitments were NKr1.1bn. The bank has made
specific provisions of NKr1bn to this end.
Christiania said its main exposure to the fisheries industry was loans to
clients outside Norway - primarily in Seattle, where excess capacity in
relation to fishing quotas had sharply reduced revenue.
The bank said it had been forced to lower the value of collateral covering
fisheries loans and warned of considerable uncertainty attached to the new
valuations. It charged accounts with NKr111m in a write-down of fixed
assets, against NKr32m last year.
However, the tone of the bank's statement was generally upbeat.
'Christiania's performance continues to improve and I note with satisfaction
that in the second quarter the bank has again shown a net profit despite
heavy losses within the fisheries sector,' said Mr Borger Lenth, president.
First-half net interest income rose by NKr44m to NKr1.6bn as non-interest
income increased by NKr377m to NKr1.18bn, including a NKr419m gain on
securities against NKr75m last year.
The bank said the end-June market value of its share portfolio was NKr133m
higher than its book value, while the market value of bonds and certificates
was NKr58m higher.
During the six months, Christiania cut non-interest expenses by NKr38m to
NKr1.41bn.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia lifts interim
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF East Asia, Hong Kong's third-largest stock market listed bank, has
increased first-half net profits by 22 per cent and will pay a higher
dividend.
Net profit after transfers to inner reserves amounted to HKDollars 198.2m
(USDollars 25.5m) for the six months to June, up from HKDollars 162.7m in
1992. The interim dividend is being increased from an adjusted 22.9 cents a
share to 27.5 cents.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations, and Mr David K. P. Li,
chief executive, predicted a strong performance from the banking industry in
the current six months.
Bank of East Asia traditionally launches Hong Kong's corporate reporting
season, and it is seen as heralding another impressive set of results from
the colony's banks.
In spite of the uncertainty from the Sino-British dispute over Governor
Chris Patten's political blueprint, the property market has recovered and
re-export growth has continued, providing momentum for domestic loan
portfolios.
Mr Li said: 'During the second half of 1993, domestic consumption and
investment are expected to pick up following a relatively quiet first half,
while the outlook for external trade is largely positive.'
However, gross interest margins for the banking sector overall have been
exceptionally wide over the past year, and in the face of increasing
competition analysts expect to see a reverse in this trend.
Winsor Industrial, the big textile group, yesterday disappointed stock
market expectations by announcing a 4 per cent decline in earnings for the
year ended March. Net profit amounted to HKDollars 262.1m, down from
HKDollars 271.8m in 1992.
The company has continued to focus its attention on relocating production
away from the colony, in the face of rising labour and land costs, and
increasing competition in slow export markets. Profit margins weakened
considerably in the second half of the year.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Loss at Sumitomo Chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Chemical, the Japanese chemicals and aluminium producer, has fallen
into loss for the six months ended June - its first since 1986 - and will
not pay an interim dividend.
It blamed the performance, which came on an 11 per cent fall in sales to
Y285.9bn, (Dollars 2.7bn), on 'the long-lasting economic recession in Japan
and the rapid yen appreciation during the period.'
Exports, which represent about one-eighth of sales, were down 14 per cent.
The pre-tax loss of Y2.93bn (in large measure stemming from a Y2.83bn
operating loss) compares with profits of Y9.08bn before tax in the same
period of 1992.
Chemical volumes and product prices both declined, the company said, more
than offsetting the benefit of cheaper raw materials.
The loss would have been worse but for a Y4.7bn gain on the sale of
securities. The net loss was Y3.35 a share, against earnings of Y3.10,
almost all of which last time was absorbed in an interim dividend payout of
Y3 a share.
For the full year, Sumitomo Chemical expects sales of Y570bn, compared with
Y624.2bn, but made no earnings forecast.
It said, however, that it did not expect a material impact on the results
from an explosion earlier this month at an epoxy resin plant.
Moody's Japan, the credit rating agency, warned yesterday that credit risks
of some of the country's chemicals companies could weaken in the coming
years, for which it foreshadowed a 'dramatic restructuring' involving a
'permanent reduction in the number of players, something the industry has
never experienced before.'
Sumitomo Chemical's debt carries a Baa1 rating, higher than that of its
peers.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Competition's cold draught -
Anheuser-Busch's defection looks set to shake up Japan's beer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S brewers are starting to be hit by the cold draught of competition. A
number of shifts are taking place in the beer market, none of which look
likely to favour the big four domestic producers.
Poor weather, along with the economic downturn, was blamed for a 1.1 per
cent fall in volume shipments for the first six months of this year, and the
summer is forecast to be short.
Price discounting by larger retailers is taking hold, and may force down
margins. Hefty marketing outlays are required to woo increasingly fickle
consumer tastes.
After a capital spending binge, the brewers' international credit standing
is being questioned.
On top of that, there is Budweiser, America's biggest-selling beer.
Anheuser-Busch has sold its beer in Japan for more than a decade, and has
brewed and bottled it under licence since 1984 in an arrangement with
Suntory, a privately-owned spirits distiller which is also the smallest of
the four brewers.
The US giant is now defecting to Kirin, Japan's biggest brewer, leaving
Suntory as the first casualty of the changing trading climate. Sales of
Budweiser, although only some 1.2 per cent of the overall market, account
for the vast majority of foreign beer sales in Japan and nearly one-sixth of
Suntory's 7.4 per cent share.
Most industry watchers, however, see the benefits as more apparent for the
US partner. It will have 90 per cent of the venture, called Budweiser Japan,
with the remainder held by Kirin, whose earlier expectations of a 49 per
cent stake were scuppered by the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's monopolies
watchdog.
Kirin officials spoke this week of 'both material and less tangible merits'
from an association with the world leader. But in spite of slow demand and a
new plant which came on stream in May, they say their company does not need
Budweiser to mop up excess capacity. They acknowledge that Budweiser is a
potential rival to Kirin.
The relationship, contracted to last 10 years, will give Busch access to
Kirin's bigger and more cohesive distribution network - for the most part,
its wholesalers deal exclusively in products sanctioned by Kirin. At the
same time, Budweiser Japan will apparently be free to use other channels.
Busch says it is not ready to discuss strategy. But it is believed to be
seeking a significantly larger share of the Japanese market - figures of 5
per cent or even 10 per cent are being suggested. Kirin says: 'We don't know
how much Budweiser we are to produce.'
In order to attain that sort of penetration, Busch is thought to be prepared
to price Budweiser very aggressively. Its strong majority position in the
joint venture will mean that it can do as it wishes. Either the market share
of Kirin's own brands - which has already fallen from 60 per cent to below
50 per cent over the past five years - or its profitability, as it adjusts
pricing to match, may be another casualty of the Busch push.
Moody's Japan, in a report on the industry, argues that the US beer giant's
different cost structure from the domestic companies means that they 'may
find it difficult to predict Anheuser-Busch's pricing strategy in Japan'.
Pricing structures and the distribution system for beer in Japan are both
under pressure. According to Moody's, the ability of Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo
and Suntory to co-ordinate price increases is on the wane.
Regulatory scrutiny may be tightened, the credit rating agency says, but
changes to the liquor tax law have already allowed in supermarkets and other
store chains, which have greater muscle to demand discounts.
The brewers' networks have traditionally supplied small family-run outlets,
and commonly undertake home delivery. The recent arrivals, by one estimate,
now account for more than 10 per cent of all beer sales. Also, they offer a
wide variety, 'resulting in increased opportunities to switch brands'.
Moody's urges the development of a broad portfolio of brands - rather than
reliance on a single flagship label which may go out of fashion - in order
to adjust to a maturing market which is also opening up.
At the same time, it warns that the aggressive capital outlays of recent
years have weakened their financial strength and says their credit quality
will remain under pressure.
Anheuser-Busch has put Y8.1bn (Dollars 76.4m) into the Kirin venture and,
with its financial muscle, come September it could force the domestic
brewers to put their past cosy relationship on ice.

TELECOM CORP, the New Zealand phone company, yesterday reported a 61.5 per
cent lift in tax-paid profits to NZDollars 118.2m (USDollars 65.2m) for the
three months ended June.
Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chief executive, said the result heralded a very
promising result for the full year.
Telecom, which is 60 per cent owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, also
announced plans for a capital restructuring which will reduce the number of
shares on issue by 20 per cent and repay capital to shareholders.
Mr Shirtcliffe said Telecom had been boosted by robust volume growth in core
markets and a 'most satisfactory' reduction in operating costs. Operating
revenues were little changed at NZDollars 597.5m.
Operating expenses fell by 15.1 per cent due to reduced personnel costs,
depreciation and other operating expenses. Staff numbers have come down by
1,605 to 11,277 over the past 12 months. In May, the company announced plans
to shed 5,000 staff over the next three years.
Earnings per share for the quarter were 5.1 NZ cents, compared with 4.1
cents.
On plans to restructure capital, Mr Shirtcliffe said that Telecom's assets
were currently funded by capital at a ratio of 33 per cent debt to 67 per
cent equity. This was more conservative than normal in the industry, he
said.
The proposed restructuring was aimed at reducing the cost of capital.

HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
yesterday reported a slight increase in first-half pre-tax profits to
NKr782m (Dollars 106.4m) from NKr757m, but said it may double the dividend.
'The board will consider increasing the dividend per share for the current
financial year by up to twice last year's distribution, bringing the payout
ratio into line with other pharmaceutical companies,' Hafslund said.
The company paid a total of NKr2.20 a share last year.
Group sales improved by NKr175m to NKr2.793bn for the six months, following
an increase in royalties to NKr361m from NKr72m.
Operating expenses increased by NKr34m to NKr1.797bn.
Operating profit fell by NKr101m to NKr741m, including research and
development costs of NKr361m against NKr341m last year.
However, Hafslund said that operating profit - once it had been adjusted for
the shipping business spun off last year into a separate bourse-listed
company - had risen by 2 per cent.
Dyno Industrier, the diversified industrial group, reported a fall in
first-half pre-tax profits to NKr144m from NKr154m.
Sales rose by NKr176m to NKr4.005bn, helped by acquisitions and a higher
dollar exchange rate.
'While the European recession continues to affect profits for the explosives
group and parts of the plastics group, the rest of the corporation's
operations produced profits above or near last year's levels,' the company
said.
Dyno forecast continued improvement in chemicals and automotive parts, but
warned of low demand for explosives in Scandinavia.

INGERSOLL-RAND, the US industrial and construction equipment group, is to
expand its European interests with the purchase of a bearings business from
Germany's struggling FAG Kugelfischer group.
The Torrington Company, I-R's wholly-owned bearings unit, is to buy
Kugelfischer's needle and cylindrical bearing business, based at Kunsebeck
in Germany.
Terms were not disclosed, but Mr J. Frank Travis, I-R vice-president and
president of Torrington, said the purchase 'greatly expands our presence in
the European bearing market.'
The Kunsebeck factory employs 1,200 and sells its needle bearings
principally in Germany and western Europe.
Mr Travis said that its products would complement Torrington's existing
bearing lines, and add significantly to its metric production capability.
Torrington already has plants in the UK and Spain, and joint ventures in
France and Italy.
Mr Travis said the purchase would enhance its capability as a supplier to
European carmakers and other customers in the European Community.
In January, Kugelfischer announced a restructuring plan to cut costs
following heavy losses last year. Tougher measures were later announced, and
Kugelfischer is planning to close or sell more than half its 17 factories.
Last month, it announced it was putting Deutsche Kugellagerfabriken Leipzig,
a lossmaking eastern German subsidiary, into liquidation.

cigarette price war

<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the large US food and tobacco group, yesterday announced an 11
per cent decline in second-quarter net income to Dollars 77m as a fierce
cigarette price war in the US continued to take its toll on earnings.
Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The extremely
competitive domestic tobacco environment led to a significant decline in our
earnings.'
Annually, RJR's US cigarette business accounts for more than half group
operating profits.
The price war began in April when Philip Morris, RJR's biggest US rival, cut
the prices of its flagship Marlboro brand in an attempt to halt the growing
popularity of discount brands. Later in the same month, RJR announced it was
lowering prices of its top Winston and Camel brands.
Mr Harper issued a warning yesterday about the group's earnings prospects,
saying that RJR expected to incur 'significant expenses' as it adjusted to
the changing business environment.
'Those expenses, along with lower domestic tobacco revenues, will further
depress our financial results through year-end,' he said.
The warning, and the lower profits, hit RJR's shares, which closed Dollars
1/8 lower at Dollars 5 1/8 (a 52-week low) on the New York Stock Exchange.
RJR's second-quarter profits would have been higher but for an after-tax
charge of Dollars 65m related to the repurchase and retirement of debt.
RJR's results in the same quarter a year ago were affected by a charge.
Excluding the special items, RJR's earnings in the latest quarter were 32
per cent lower than in the same three months of 1992.
Operating income in the quarter fell 24 per cent to Dollars 582m, and net
sales dropped 7 per cent to Dollars 3.72bn.
Net Sales in RJR's worldwide tobacco business fell 13 per cent to Dollars
2.03bn following a 20 per cent drop in domestic sales.
The company said, however, that the recent price cuts and increased
promotional activities should lead to improved sales of its top brands.
The food businesses reported a modest improvement in second-quarter sales to
Dollars 1.69bn, a performance that the company said reflected stronger US
and international biscuit volumes, costs savings from productivity
initiatives and the contribution of recent acquisitions.
The news of RJR's falling profits comes a month after the group abandoned
plans to raise Dollars 1.5bn through an offering of shares pegged to the
performance of its food division because of a general weakness in the market
for food company shares.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Matif, DTB to extend
co-operation

THE MATIF, the French futures and options exchange, plans to accelerate its
co-operation with Deutsche Terminborse, its German counterpart, by studying
the feasibility of closer operational and strategic links between the two
markets.
The exchanges, two of Europe's largest futures markets, late last year
agreed to link their operations so that traders in each market would have
direct access to the other. This will involve the Matif installing the DTB's
computerised trading system.
This agreement was seen as the most ambitious collaborative venture between
exchanges. However, the Matif and DTB have decided to try to extend their
co-operation to trading and clearing. This could involve pooling their
software in those areas.
Mr Jorg Franke, chief executive of the DTB, said the partnership was
intended to 'address the needs of investors who want to trade cheaply
without borderlines'. The Matif and DTB hope their collaboration will
improve liquidity in their market and cut costs to investors thereby
enabling them to counter growing competition from banks' over-the-counter
products.
The French and Germans are considering opening up their partnership to other
international exchanges. The Matif said a number of markets had expressed
interest, although the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange (Liffe) was not believed to be among them. The Franco-German
partnership could pose a threat to Liffe, which is the biggest futures
exchange in Europe.
The first phase of the Franco-German agreement will come into force next
year when screens will be installed in France so that Matif members can
trade directly in DTB interest rate products, including German government
bonds.
In the second phase, the French will buy a licence to use DTB software which
will enable some Matif products to be traded electronically. This system
will then be opened up to DTB members. The Matif said it had assessed
different forms of software but had decided that the DTB system was best
suited to its needs.
Matif members will choose two products - from among the Paris-based
exchange's Ecu bond futures and option, three-month Pibor futures and
option, French medium-term futures and CAC-40 stock index futures - which
will be listed on the system, and these two products will then cease to be
traded on an open outcry system.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Bank Austria in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK Austria, Austria's largest bank, has reported a sharp improvement in
earnings in the first half and forecast a 26 per cent rise in full-year
pre-tax profits to Sch4.3bn (Dollars 358m).
Improved interest margins, active securities markets and rationalisation
measures following the 1991 merger which created the bank, contributed to a
51 per cent jump in first-half pre-tax profits to Sch2.01bn.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, the chief executive, said the bank expected for the
second half 'a basic continuation of the positive tendencies in the first
half'.
The bank announced that it planned to launch an American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) programme on its preferred shares in the autumn. Last year, it started
ADRs on its ordinary shares.
A London listing was postponed earlier this year because of the bank's poor
1992 results. It would be considered next spring at the earliest, the bank
said.
In the first half, net interest income grew 11.6 per cent to Sch5.8bn due
largely to the unwinding of an inverted yield curve during the period.
The bank said lending business was sluggish, and loans outstanding fell 0.8
per cent to Sch349.2bn. Commission income was flat at Sch1.23bn.
Partial operating profit, which excludes securities trading for the bank's
own account, soared 41 per cent to Sch1.15bn. The bank cautioned that this
growth rate figure, like that of pre-tax profit, was flattered by the
depressed banking conditions in the first half of last year.
Total assets grew 3.3 per cent to Sch562.8bn.
The bank said its rationalisation programme was on schedule. The number of
employees has been cut to 9,350 from 9,924, since the merger, and 18 of a
planned 86 branch mergers completed.
Bank Austria is 51 per cent owned by two institutions controlled by the city
of Vienna.

expectations

<TEXT>
SIP, Italy's main telephone operating utility, reported sales of L9,451bn
(Dollars 6m) in the first five months of this year. The company failed to
produce comparable figures for the corresponding period in 1992, but claimed
its results were in line with expectations.
The company said sales for the first half, due to be released in September,
would be similar to the L10,601bn reported in the first six months of 1992.
The figures came as the Italian government gave its approval to the
restructuring plan for the telecommunications sector, dominated by Stet,
Sip's parent company, which is in turn controlled by the IRI state holding
group.
The plan envisages the streamlining of the complex telecoms sector, which
currently includes seven leading public sector groups, and the creation of a
single entity, tentatively called Telecom Italia.
In a first move, Sip is expected to merge with Italcable, the long-distance
international carrier, early next year.
Mr Ernesto Pascale, Sip's chairman, said the company would not be seeking
across-the-board tariff increases next year, but said it would try to
restructure charges within existing ceilings.
The number of telephone subscribers rose to 23.9m by end-May, while
subscribers to Sip's highly-profitable mobile telephone service climbed to
864,000.
Sogefi, the Italian auto components group controlled by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti's Cir holding company, is setting up a joint venture with Arvin
Industries of the US to rationalise their car exhaust systems businesses.
The new company, which will have sales of about L300m and 1,600 employees,
will be Europe's biggest producer of silencers. It will have four factories
in Italy, France and the UK.
The joint venture, combining Arvin's US exhaust technology with Sogefi's
European sales and commercial know-how, will be geared exclusively to the
replacement market.

Banco Essi, the investment banking subsidiary of Portugal's Espirito Santo
Financial Holding, has joined Mr George Soros, the investor, in establishing
a Dollars 100m development capital fund, Reuter reports from Madrid.
The new fund, Espirito Santo Development Capital Investors, will make equity
and equity-related development capital investments in companies located in
Portugal or with significant business activities in that country.
'Esdcil's objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on its
investments,' Espirito Santo said.
The lead investor will be Soros Capital, which will contribute Dollars 50m,
while the Espirito Santo group will contribute Dollars 7m to the new fund,
through Banco Essi.
The Portuguese group did not say who would contribute the rest of the
capital.
Soros Capital would be the vehicle through which Quantum Emerging Growth
Partners would conduct some of its investment activities, the Portuguese
group said.
Quantum Emerging Growth Partners is an open-end investment fund set up in
1992 principally advised by Soros Fund Management, which is solely-owned by
Mr Soros.
A representative of Soros Capital will be appointed to Esdcil's board of
directors as well as to the executive and advisory committees.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Argentaria improves 14.6% to
Pta43bn after loans provision

<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the state-controlled Spanish banking group that was partially
privatised earlier this year, lifted first-half net profits by 14.6 per cent
to Pta43.1bn (Dollars 324m) after putting aside a Pta49.5bn provision for
non-performing loans.
The profit figure was due to high earnings in fee commissions which were up
by 13.3 per cent to Pta24.2bn and, in particular, to sharply increased
extraordinary income which was up 33.6 per cent and realised Pta40.1bn.
Reflecting Argentaria's tightened management structure, nearly half of the
extraordinary income was raised through loans recoveries.
The banking group's provisions, which increased by 45.6 per cent against the
first six months of last year, raised Argentaria's non-performing loan
coverage to 91.4 per cent.
Argentaria reported an improved return of assets, to 0.87 per cent from 0.81
per cent in the first half of last year. The group's return of equity was up
to 15.31 per cent from 14.60 per cent.
In early May, Argentaria placed just under 25 per cent of its shares on the
market in an offering aimed at both the domestic retail market and foreign
institutions. By the end of June, the offered share price of Pta3.800 had
revalued by 24.3 per cent to Pta4.725.

FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Underwriting losses hold back
Allianz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ, Germany's largest insurance company, yesterday reported a dip in
pre-tax profits to DM1.62bn (Dollars 953m) in 1992 after suffering its first
underwriting losses in its domestic market since 1971.
The result, which compares with pre-tax profits of DM1.78bn in 1991, was
better than most analysts had expected, mainly because of an improved
performance by overseas subsidiaries.
After-tax profits fell to DM857.9m compared with DM1.048bn in the previous
year, due to a higher tax charge. Earnings per share (calculated on the same
basis as UK and US companies) were DM26 compared with DM25.05, a rise of
29.7 per cent.
Underwriting losses in the German non-life market, where Allianz has a 17
per cent share, reflected heavy motor theft and weather-related claims. They
were offset by an improvement in the results of foreign subsidiaries, which
were helped by effect of cost-cutting and higher premium rates.
Allianz subsidiaries in the UK (Cornhill), Italy (RAS), France (Allianz Via)
and the USA (Fireman's Fund) improved their underwriting results by DM350m.
Overall underwriting losses were DM1.68bn compared with DM1.78bn in 1991.
Investment income amounted to DM3.305bn, DM250m less than in 1991 when
extraordinary earnings from an asset swap, involving the group's Austrian
subsidiary, amounted to DM484m.
'Allianz is in good shape for the single market. The company is leaner, more
streamlined and even more customer-oriented,' said Dr Henning
Schulte-Noelle, chief executive.
Overall premium income rose by 12.3 per cent to DM54.7bn, of which DM29bn is
generated from Germany.
The figures reflected the consolidation for the first time of figures for
the second half-year from Deutsche Krankenversicherung, Allianz's health
insurance subsidiary. At an underlying rate, income grew at a rate of 10 per
cent.
Deutsche Versicherungs (DVAG), the former east German state-owned insurer
acquired by Allianz in 1990, saw its premium income increase by 20 per cent,
partially because of increases in premium rates.
The group is expecting further growth in premium income in 1993 to DM60bn
but says its main focus is on improving underwriting results, through
premium increases, restrictions in cover and cost cutting. The group lost
4,000 employees in 1992, mainly because of a shake-out at DVAG, and plans
further reductions in 1993, cutting staffing levels from 63,000 to 60,000
people.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DALE Electric International, the North Yorkshire-based power and lighting
group, increased pre-tax profits by 41 per cent to Pounds 2.26m in the year
to May 2, thanks to an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.05m relating to the
disposal of its French subsidiaries in March.
Comparisons have been restated as the extraordinary item has been moved up
the profits and loss account to an exceptional item, moving towards FRS 3
accounting principles. Accordingly, pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.79m is
altered to Pounds 1.6m after an exceptional loss up from Pounds 158,000 to
Pounds 347,000.
Mr Iain Dale, chairman, said the group had 'a clear idea of its priorities
and direction.' The current year would benefit from the restructuring.
New opportunities had arisen both in the UK and overseas for the group's
range of gas turbine generating sets for mobile and combined heat-and-power
applications, he said.
Half of group sales of Pounds 60.1m (Pounds 55.9m), came from exports to
more than 115 countries. Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.41m (Pounds
3.35m).
Mr Dale said the current order book was Pounds 19m, or four months work,
compared with Pounds 25m a year ago. He said orders could be the main
problem in the current first half in the nervous market.
Gearing was reduced from a peak of 110 per cent to 65 per cent, and 'will be
reduced further as the main part of the redundant Ashford site and a
non-core business are sold.' Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.86m to
Pounds 1.57m.
Earnings per share increased by 51 per cent to 13.24p (8.74p). The final
dividend of 3.1p makes an unchanged total of 5.1p.
Sir Tom McDonald, former chairman, is to retire as a non-executive director
tomorrow.
The shares gained 6p to 110p.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Saville Gordon upbeat on future despite 33%
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J SAVILLE Gordon, the Birmingham-based group with interests split between
steel and pipeline equipment merchanting and property investment, yesterday
shrugged off a 33 per cent decline in annual profits with a forecast that it
'is entering a period of real growth'.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-April were Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 3.49m).
Turnover fell from Pounds 57.2m to Pounds 28.4m, reflecting the withdrawal
from securities dealing at the end of the 1991-92 year.
Earnings per share slipped from 2.9p to 1.4p, but the final dividend is
maintained at 1.7p for a same-again total of 2.2p.
Mr John Saville, chairman, accepted with equanimity the need to take funds
from reserves to meet the dividend payment. 'We've got the first few months
of the current year under our belts; we know what we can afford,' he said.
On the property side, operating profits rose last year and will continue to
do so this year as rent reviews come into effect. But while last year the
group did not obtain the full benefit of the declining interest rates, this
year it will.
Meanwhile, on the merchanting side, there has been a sharp upturn in demand
at the steel stockholding arm, and the company is making a profit for the
first time in three years.
Pipeline equipment sales, however, are depressed and will remain so until a
revival of the construction industry.

</HEADLINE>

   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITAN INVESTMENT, the largest investment trust managed by Henderson Touche
Remnant, is raising Pounds 56.25m via an issue of exchangeable bonds which
will mature in 2008.
The bonds will be convertible into a basket of shares in three other trusts
managed by Henderson Touche Remnant - Electric and General, Greenfriar and
Lowland.
The bonds will pay a coupon of 6.25 per cent and will be callable, at
Witan's option, after 1998.
Witan has also sold part of its holding in the Henderson Administration fund
management group. The sale of 1.75m shares, 8.2 per cent of Henderson's
capital, raised Pounds 14.9m for Witan and reduced its stake to 15.2 per
cent. Witan said it had no intention of making any further market sales in
Henderson shares over the next 12 months; Henderson will still be the
trust's single largest holding.
Mr Christopher Clarke, managing director of Witan said that the deal enabled
the trust to reduce its exposure to Henderson or Henderson-managed trusts.
Previously that exposure had represented over Pounds 100m out of Witan's
assets of Pounds 880m.
In addition, Mr Clarke said the deal enabled Witan to sell shares in the
three other trusts at a premium to their net asset values.

<TEXT>
EX-LANDS, a property inv-estment and management group, has announced a
placing and open offer to raise Pounds 15m.
It is also buying a Pounds 5.8m portfolio of property in South Kensington,
comprising 13,730 sq ft of offices, 13 retail units and nine flats.
The remainder of the funds will be available for further purchases of high
yielding property and additional working capital to fund the development of
golf courses in continental Europe.
Ex-Lands is managed by Mr Robert Bourne and Mr Graham Bourne, who used to
run Local London before it was sold to Priest Marians in 1989. The Saatchi
brothers, founders of the advertising group, own 10 per cent of the shares.
The offer entitles shareholders to apply for Pounds 1 nominal of 7.5 per
cent convertible unsecured loan stock 2020 for every five shares held. The
offer has been underwritten by Paribas.
The company said it expects to make a pre-tax profit for the year to June 30
1993 of at least Pounds 900,000. It intends to pay a dividend of 0.35p for
the year.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: LWT improves to Pounds 16.5m - Conversion
of preferred and management shares expected next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LWT (HOLDINGS) yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.5m for the
six months to June 30 - an increase of 20.5 per cent on the same period of
1992.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, claimed that an increase in underlying
profit margins from 19.6 per cent to 26.6 per cent gave the company among
the highest margins in the industry.
The announcement also set the clock running for the conversion of the
preferred and management shares which is now expected to take place next
month.
On the present price level - the shares rose another 14p to 483p yesterday
having performed well since Granada recently acquired a 17.5 per cent stake
 -more than 40 managers are likely to hold ordinary shares worth a sum
approaching Pounds 70m.
Sir Christopher said he expected managers to sell some shares almost
immediately, partly to pay off loans taken out to purchase management
shares. Sir Christopher said he expected managers to retain about 10 per
cent of the shares out of the 15 per cent they will hold on conversion.
He added that the group was performing well and a 'good result' was expected
for the whole year, although advertising revenue continued to be short-term
and difficult to forecast.
Turnover at Pounds 121.2m was down Pounds 13.2m, largely because of the loss
of Channel 4 airtime. The company's share of net advertising revenue was up
3.8 per cent compared with 4 per cent for ITV as a whole.
LWT's share of London advertising was down by 0.25 per cent with the London
share of ITV down by 1 per cent.
Operating profit before payments to the Independent Television Commission
rose by 39 per cent to Pounds 32.3m.
LWT's share of the Pounds 10m losses of Good Morning, the commercial
breakfast service, was Pounds 2m.
Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive, said he hoped the service, which had run into
stiffer-than-expected competition from Channel 4's The Big Breakfast, could
break even next year although it might take until 1995.
Fully diluted earnings per share were up 24 per cent to 10.2p.
The company has already paid a fixed preferred dividend of 2.95p and another
is likely in September. After that the board said it will adopt 'a
progressive dividend policy reflecting LWT's performance and cash position.'
The first ordinary dividend will be a final for the year to December 1993.
Barring unforeseen circumstances the total for the year will be
'significantly ahead' of the current fixed dividend of 5.9p.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Freeman falls to Pounds 357,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECLINE in profits from French operations and a loss in its Spanish
offshoot left Freeman Group, the USM- quoted insulation, distribution and
fabrication specialist, with pre-tax profits down from Pounds 550,000 to
Pounds 357,000 in the six months to June 30.
Mr Euan English, chairman, said, however, that adverse short-term trading
conditions should not cloud what the board believed to be encouraging
prospects for the medium term.
The results, in accordance with FRS 3, included exceptional income of Pounds
147,000 relating to the release of provision for expenses on discontinued
operations.
Turnover rose to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 28m), while interest rose to Pounds
373,000 (Pounds 282,000) mainly as a result of the cost of financing the
Spanish subsidiary acquired last August. Earnings were 4.1p (4.9p) and the
interim dividend is again 2p.

Integration of acquisitions and reduced interest rates helped Sidney C
Banks, the grain and agricultural specialist, lift annual profits to Pounds
2.87m pre-tax, against Pounds 2.29m.
Turnover in the 12 months to April 30 improved to Pounds 280.6m (Pounds
236.7m) reflecting the influence of sterling's withdrawal from the ERM on
cereal prices; sales included a full contribution from Doltons and nine
months from Rucker &amp; Slann.
A proposed final dividend of 2p brings the total for the year to 9p (8.25p),
covered 2.5 times by earnings of 22.5p (19.9p).

The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 14m to Pounds 20.1m.

ABBEY PANELS Investments, an engineer supplying the motor, aerospace and

losses and said there was little sign of improvement in the near future.
The company reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 993,000 (Pounds 1.18m)

Deficit per share came to 48.4p (49.8p).
It had suffered significant cuts by large customers and had recently made 60
employees redundant at a cost of about Pounds 150,000.
The directors said that costs were being cut to the bone and all
opportunities were being aggressively pursued, but it would be some time

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: John Gunn returns to the corporate fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL announced yesterday features Mr John Gunn, former chief executive of
British and Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group that
collapsed two years ago.
It also provides a UK vehicle for the media interests of Mr Clive Ng, the
Malaysian entrepreneur who has large cable television interests in Asia
through United International Holdings.
The USM-quoted Wilton Group has agreed to sell a 35.6 per cent stake in its
main quoted subsidiary, Glenchewton, formerly Cowan de Groot, to a group of
investors which includes Mr Gunn.
He will be joined on the board of Glenchewton by two former colleagues - Mr
Matt McBride, who will become chief executive, and Mr Allan Jonnes , who
will be finance director.
Mr McBride is a former founder director of Bricom Group, the industrial
conglomerate which was the subject of a Pounds 359m buy-out from British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings in 1988, and Mr Jonnes is the former chief executive
of Bricom.
Glenchewton currently imports and distributes toys, household goods and
basketware. Mr McBride said the company was unlikely to move towards the
financial services area, in which Mr Gunn made his name, and would be more
interested in manufacturing and business-to-business services.
Another investor, Sir Victor Garland, a director of Throgmorton Trust and
former director of Prudential Corporation, will become non-executive
chairman of Glenchewton.
Wilton, which owned 69.9 per cent of Glenchewton, has agreed to sell 9m
shares - representing 35.6 per cent of the equity - at 19p per share for a
total consideration of Pounds 1.9m. Glenchewton shares closed 2 1/2 p higher
at 33 1/2 p.
Mr Ng will take a maximum 28.48 per cent stake in Wilton. He will subscribe
for 100m new shares at 1p and participate in a 1-for-2 rights issue at the
same price which will raise Pounds 3.5m before expenses. He has also been
granted an option over another 60m shares at 2p. Wilton shares yesterday
closed  1/4 p lower at 1 1/4 p.
Wilton said that in recognition of Mr Ng's substantial investment, he would
join the board as an executive director and deputy chairman.
Mr Michael Buckley, Wilton's chairman, said the group was interested in
areas such as cable television and he expected that the involvement of Mr Ng
would bring opportunities for Wilton to expand into media businesses
worldwide.
The combined proceeds from the rights issue will eliminate indebtedness at
Wilton, which has now sold most of its former property portfolio.
The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 810,000 in 1992, compared with a
profit of Pounds 39,000 the previous year. Sales rose from Pounds 19.2m to
Pounds 30.1m. Losses per share were 0.17p (0.002p). Once again, there was no
dividend.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Misys 66%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISYS, the computer services group, yesterday reported a 66 per cent
increase in annual profits, reflecting strong organic growth and a good
performance by acquired businesses.
Pre-tax profits in the year to May 31 advanced from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds
15.1m, struck after a Pounds 1.19m provision for proposed reorganisation and
other costs, principally within the open systems and computer services
divisions.
Earnings per share improved by 54 per cent to 27.4p (17.8p); a proposed
final dividend of 4.4p brings the total for the year to 7.01p (6.1p).
Turnover expanded by 30 per cent to Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 68m) including
Pounds 14.8m from acquisitions. Hardware revenues, as expected, continued to
fall but software sales increased by 41 per cent. The acquisition of the
Countrywide companies in June last year added to the underlying growth in
service revenues, which jumped 38 per cent.
Software products and support services now account for 74 per cent of group
revenues, up from 70 per cent a year ago. Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, noted
that this improvement in the mix of revenues has resulted in a useful rise
in gross margins.
A particularly strong performance by the financial services division helped
boost group operating profits to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 8.87m) including
Pounds 4.09m from acquisitions. The improvement in operating profits of
businesses owned throughout the whole of the past two years, excluding the
reorganisation provision, accounted for just over half the total increase
for the group over the previous year.
The organic growth in profits mainly reflected growth in market share for
software products and services which, Mr Lomax said, had continued to
improve their competitive positions. Order books in these businesses and in
the group as a whole ended the year at record levels.
The group continued to maintain firm control over working capital and ended
the year with cash balances of Pounds 21m (Pounds 10m). This was after
spending about Pounds 2.9m on acquisitions which, aside from Countrywide,
included Specialist, Innsite and CMS.
COMMENT
With Pounds 21m of cash in the bank Misys has considerable financial
flexibility and remains on the lookout for possible UK and international
acquisitions. However, recent results have been underpinned by solid organic
growth, although the financial services division in particular has been
strengthened considerably by the Countrywide companies, which outperformed
expectations. Despite lower hardware sales the steady growth of higher
margin software and service revenues bodes well for the future, as does the
continued heavy emphasis on the development and enhancement of its product
range. Last year R&amp;D spending grew by more than 30 per cent. Yesterday the
share price gained another 11p to 518p, and analysts were upgrading their
forecasts. With projected pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.6m and earnings of
32.3p this year, the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 16 and still
rate as a buy.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Allied Radio losses jump
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED Radio is considering a reconstruction of the balance sheet including
the conversion of loan stock and eliminating the negative balance on the
profit and loss account.
The company, which provides local services in Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire,
reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 585,000) for the six months
to March 31. Turnover was Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.17m) of which Pounds
745,000 (Pounds 650,000) related to discontinued activities.
The operating loss for continuing activities increased to Pounds 671,000
(Pounds 217,000) but the company said that the figure included non-recurring
costs.
Losses per share were 2.52p (1.39p).

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Unitech down to Pounds 10m in poor Japanese
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Unitech, the electronic components maker, fell from
Pounds 14m to Pounds 10.5m in the 12 months to May 31, hit by poor Japanese
trading conditions for the second successive year.
The shares rose by 10p to 258p as a strong market rewarded the proposal to
raise the final dividend to 4p (3.75p), making 6.1p (5.85p) for the year.
Earnings per share were 7.3p (13.2p).
The 1992 comparisons have been restated under FRS 3.
Pre-tax profits, which suffered a net non-recurring loss of Pounds 103,000
but were flattered by a Pounds 600,000 gain on exchange rates, were struck
on reduced turnover of Pounds 252.9m (Pounds 253.5m).
Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said profits of the Japanese subsidiary declined
49 per cent to Pounds 3.6m.
Operating profits dropped to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 17m).
Net interest payable fell to Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 5.14m). Net debt was
Pounds 62.3m (Pounds 40.9m), giving gearing of 58 per cent (43 per cent).
COMMENT
FOR all of management's clever attempts to broaden its market, as a
quasi-commodity business serving the global power supplies market, Unitech
should be a Cinderella stock. Fortunately for shareholders it has a listed
Japanese Prince Charming in Nemic-Lambda. This handsome business is
currently attracting interest because its recently difficult market seems to
be recovering. Unitech's stake alone could be worth as much as the whole
company, giving a gross asset value per share of about 430p, compared with
yesterday's closing price of 258p. With corporate unbundling all the rage,
the shares are likely to trade on these calculations rather than a pre-tax
profit forecast of Pounds 15m and a prospective multiple in the high-20s.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pharmaceuticals division behind growth at
Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID BARNES, Zeneca's chief executive, yesterday said his greatest
priority was to drive the pharmaceuticals division as hard as he could,
writes Paul Abrahams.
The division, the company's largest and most profitable, gave all the signs
of being successfully driven yesterday.
Most surprising was the increase in sales of Zestril, the ace-inhibitor used
to treat heart disease, which rose 64 per cent from Pounds 127m to Pounds
208m. Underlying growth, excluding exchange rates, was an impressive 44 per
cent, although prices fell 1 per cent. Mr John Mayo, finance director, said
Zestril had benefited from the switching of much of the US sales force from
Tenormin, where patents have expired.
However, the benefits of Zeneca's recent emphasis on the managed care market
in the US - the company now has about 40 key account managers dedicated to
the sector - had also helped. It had been able to differentiate the once a
day Zestril treatment from other drugs in the over-crowded ace-inhibitor
market.
Zeneca's position in the hospital market appeared to be paying dividends.
Sales of Zoladex, a cancer treatment, rose 43 per cent from Pounds 49m to
Pounds 70m. Underlying sales increased 31 per cent, though prices fell 2 per
cent. Nolvadex, another cancer treatment, generated sales up 49 per cent to
Pounds 175m. Growth, excluding exchange rates, was a creditable 26 per cent.
Diprivan, an anaesthetic, generated sales up 42 per cent from Pounds 67m to
Pounds 95m. Underlying growth was 25 per cent, including a 5 per cent sales
increase.
Healthcare reforms hit Zeneca's sales in Germany where they dropped 4 per
cent, from Pounds 49m to Pounds 47m. The combined fall in volumes and prices
was 18 per cent, compared with 21 per cent for the whole market.
The agrochemical division increased its sales of herbicides by 15 per cent
from Pounds 366m to Pounds 421m, although volume growth was only 1 per cent.
Insecticides turnover was up 12 per cent from Pounds 138m to Pounds 155m,
although volumes were static. Fungicide sales fell 2 per cent, from Pounds
91m to Pounds 89m, while underlying volumes fell 11 per cent. Sales of seeds
increased 11 per cent to Pounds 99m, although volumes were down 3 per cent.
Although the specialities division raised sales by 8 per cent to Pounds
519m, underlying growth was static. The textile colours and dyestuffs sector
suffered most from the recession. Sales of biological products, such as
Quorn, increased 9 per cent, from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12m.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: LMS net assets fall by 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing fall in property prices cut net assets per share of London
Merchant Securities, the property developer and invester, by 17 per cent
from 99p to 81p in the 12 months to March 31.
Pre-tax profits, however, improved from Pounds 24m to Pounds 25.6m.
The drop in net assets followed a 9 per cent decline in the previous year.
LMS said the market value of its listed investments, notably First Leisure,
and trading property was more than Pounds 50m higher than the book value.
Lord Rayne, chairman, said: 'Space available in the company's new buildings
is now being taken up and active interest is being shown in all of them.'
But rental levels remained depressed.
Net rental income from investment properties reached Pounds 29.5m (Pounds
28.9m). Other income, mainly bank interest on the cash deposits partly
created by the sale of shares in First Leisure in the previous period,
amounted to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 6.1m).
Interest payable was Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 14.8m). Total debt stood at Pounds
188m (Pounds 160m), but with cash of Pounds 124m (Pounds 103m) net gearing
was 24 per cent.
The proposed final dividend of 3.2p (3p) makes a total of 4p (3.8p) from
earnings of 6.39p (6.54p).

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lex Service accelerates 33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGER share of more buoyant markets helped Lex Service, the UK's largest
car distribution and leasing company, report interim profits up by 33 per
cent yesterday. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman, forecast 'considerably higher'
new car registrations this year.
Profit before tax and exceptional items increased from Pounds 16m to Pounds
21.2m in the six months to June 27 reflecting improving demand in the car
and truck markets.
After exceptional items - including disposal of the Volvo import concession
in 1992 which resulted in a Pounds 63.7m exceptional gain and the sale of
Arrow Electronics shares in the latest period which generated a Pounds 60.1m
exceptional gain - the group showed pre-tax profits under the new FRS 3
accounting rules of Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 84.9m).
Earnings per share excluding the exceptional items increased from 10.5p to
13.3p and the interin dividend is lifted from 4p to 4.7p. Including
exceptionals earnings slipped to 74.8p (78.5p) per share.
Profits in the latest period also included a non-recurring Pounds 2.6m for
the period October to December reflecting the decision of the group's
contract hire joint ventures to change their accounting year end.
Excluding this, and adjusting for the loss of the Volvo import concession,
pre-tax profit before exceptionals rose 36 per cent to Pounds 18.6m.
Sir Trevor said group car dealerships throughout Britain were reporting 'a
very encouraging level of orders for August,' traditionally the busiest
month of the year for new car registrations.
He said total August registrations could be up by over 10 per cent on last
August.
COMMENT
With yesterday's acquisition of the Arlington dealerships Lex has
consolidated its position as UK's largest car retailing group. Meanwhile,
the Hyundai concession, while tiny in comparison to Volvo, gives Lex a
foothold back in the import business. Overall, however, it is new car sales
which drive the business - since they generate after sales revenues and
second-hand car sales. If the optimism on this score proves correct the
timing of Lex's latest acquisition will look sweet. Pre-tax profits this
year, excluding the exceptionals, should reach between Pounds 37m and Pounds
40m, equivalent to minimum earnings of 25p a share. On that basis the shares
are trading on a prospective p/e of 16.7.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ADT raising Dollars 144m to help refinance
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based security services and car auction company, is raising
Dollars 144m via a public offer in the US of 18m shares at Dollars 8 apiece.
The shares rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 .
The proceeds will help ADT refinance Dollars 1.3bn of debt and meet
preference share obligations. First Boston Corporation and Merrill Lynch are
managing underwriters for the public offering. After the refinancing, ADT's
gearing will still be more than 100 per cent.
ADT also confirmed the rescheduling of Dollars 600m of debt through a public
offering of Dollars 250m of 8.25 per cent senior notes 2000 and Dollars 350m
of 9.25 per cent notes 2003. Merrill Lynch and First Boston were also
managing underwriters for the offerings.
In addition, ADT has syndicated with a group of US and international banks a
six-year Dollars 500m credit facility, subject to final documentation. This
transaction was arranged by Chemical Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia and will
become effective simultaneously with the closing of the equity and public
debt offerings.
ADT said it would use the proceeds of the public offerings, together with
cash on hand, to repay all indebtedness outstanding under ADT's two
principal existing credit facilities.

VILLIERS Group, formerly Caspen Oil, is to raise Pounds 5.04m net via a
rights issue in order to develop existing engineering interests and to
acquire small engineering companies.
The issue, fully underwritten by Marshall Securities, is of 50.4m new shares
at 10 1/2 p each on a 1-for-1 basis.
It will eliminate net debt, while in the short term part of the proceeds
will be used to support the reorganisation of borrowings related to the oil
business.
USM-quoted Villiers recently announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.15m
(Pounds 6,000 profit) for the six months to January 31, struck after
exceptional charges of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 169,000 credits).

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield turns in 19% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of a wide-ranging cost cutting programme appear to be feeding
through to the bottom line at Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the agribusiness,
chemicals and plantations group which yesterday reported a 19 per cent
increase to Pounds 48.4m in first half profits.
The group, which lifted sales by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn, also announced
the retirement of Mr John Maltby, chairman, who will step down in May. He
will be replaced by Mr George Paul, chief executive. Mr Bill Turcan, finance
director, steps up into the chief executive post.
A disappointing performance from the BOCM Pauls animal foods business,
acquired in April last year, held back growth in the agriculture and foods
division. Nevertheless, this business still increased operating profits by
30 per cent to Pounds 19m on sales ahead 85 per cent to Pounds 373m.
Mr Paul said BOCM Pauls had suffered a sharp decline in margins in spite of
considerable cost savings. The group's failure to secure lower raw materials
prices at the time of sterling's devaluation last year had had a
significantly adverse effect in the first quarter, he said. However, margins
were now beginning to recover.
The chemicals division raised profits from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 20.7m, on
the back of large cost savings in the pigments division. The group closed
four of its six factories in the US.
Timber and building supplies returned a 4 per cent increase to Pounds 11.5m.
This masked a sharp rise in the builders' merchant business in the UK, where
rationalisation resulted in a 20 per cent increase in profits.
The plantations division enjoyed one of its most successful years with a 46
per cent rise in profits to Pounds 12.4m.
Earnings per share rose by 0.3p to 4p, and the interim dividend is
maintained at 3.6p.
COMMENT
Harrisons has enjoyed some success with its restructuring, and promises yet
more in the chemicals and animal feeds divisions. However, animal feeds is
regarded as a mature market with heavy competition becoming the main
feature, while chemicals is increasingly exposed to the depressed
continental European market. On the brighter side, economic recovery is
bound to do a world of good for all divisions, especially building supplies.
The main attraction of this stock, however, seems to be the yield. At 6 per
cent, this is tempting when all talk is of another base rate cut. Forecasts
are for Pounds 105m this year, for a prospective p/e of 21. Although not a
sell, one wonders just how much higher the shares can go in the short term
under the circumstances.

FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ICI falls to Pounds 364m and 5,000 more
jobs to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 down
from Pounds 420m to Pounds 364m. Sales increased from Pounds 6.15bn to
Pounds 6.34bn.
The figures include a five-month contribution from Zeneca and six months
from the nylon operations that have been sold to Du Pont of the US.
Trading profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 149m to Pounds
180m. Turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 4.17bn (Pounds 3.82bn).
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said he viewed the performance of his
continuing businesses as solid.
'I think that our profitability relative to our competitors on the Continent
is quite good. But in absolute terms it is not good enough.'
Favourable currency rates added Pounds 50m to the results. A further Pounds
50m was added through the restructuring.
Earnings for continuing business before exceptional items were 12.4p
(11.2p). The interim dividend is 10.5p. ICI's shares advanced 16p to 666p.
Zeneca, during its last five months within ICI, contributed Pounds 329m
(Pounds 326m). Fibres suffered a Pounds 21m loss, compared with a profit of
Pounds 13m. Total trading profit was Pounds 488m (Pounds 473m).
Loan repayments from Zeneca allowed ICI to cut gearing from 33.4 per cent to
23 per cent, according to Mr Colin Short, finance director.
Mr Hampel said that since the end of 1990, staff numbers had been cut by
22,000 and a further 5,000 would follow, not including the 5,000 who
transferred to Du Pont.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'The outlook continues to be uncertain
in almost all the markets in which we operate, with the possible exception
of the Asia Pacific area.'
The industrial chemicals business lifted operating profits to Pounds 60m
(Pounds 32m) on turnover up from Pounds 1.77bn to Pounds 1.89bn.
The paints division reported trading profits of Pounds 50m (Pounds 61m) on
sales of Pounds 856m (Pounds 814m). Weak demand in Europe and the US was
offset by buoyant demand in Asia. Mr Hampel said a cash payment of Pounds
25m had been made to Lilly Industries when ICI had swapped its packaging
coatings business for Lilly's industrial coatings operations.
Materials raised operating profits by Pounds 2m to Pounds 13m on turnover up
from Pounds 656m to Pounds 743m.
Trading profits at the explosives division fell to Pounds 20m (Pounds 24m)
on sales of Pounds 318m (284m). Regional businesses raised profits to Pounds
29m (Pounds 15m) on sales of Pounds 690m (Pounds 664m).

FT  30 JUL 93 / Foray leaves buyer poorer but wiser: Andrew Adonis charts
STC's fate since its takeover by Northern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago Northern Telecom of Canada hailed its Dollars 3.61bn (Pounds
2.42bn) purchase of the telecommunications side of STC, the UK electronics
group, as a decisive European breakthrough.
Last week the Canadian equipment manufacturer announced a second quarter
loss of more than Dollars 1bn, a Dollars 500m write-down of the Dollars
1.8bn goodwill acquired with STC, and the Dollars 900m sale to Alcatel of
France of what many see as the jewel in the STC crown - its submarine
systems division.
Mr Jean Monty, Northern's new chief executive, said the write-down and
disposal were needed because STC 'had not lived up to expectations in the
short-term'.
The former STC business is not at the heart of Northern's problems. Mr Ted
Larkin, telecoms analyst with Bunting Warburg in Toronto, says it plays
'only a small role in the big picture at Nortel'. The North American central
office switching business, accounting for half of revenue, is 'centre
stage'.
However, the fate of STC, which until its sale to Northern was the UK's
second largest telecom equipment supplier, is a commentary on the
undiminished enthusiasm in the industry for cross-border alliances and
acquisitions. And the particular fate of STC Submarine Systems puts in
question future UK research on the leading edge of advanced fibre-optic
technology.
Even in 1990, Northern's purchase of STC for a sum equivalent to more than
half its own value got a lukewarm reception. Northern was widely thought to
have paid too much; the fit between its Canadian and UK businesses was far
from close; and the rationale for the purchase as an entree into 'post-1992
Europe' was questioned.
Last week's events appear to bear out all three concerns. After two years of
retrenchment in the STC business and the disposal of nearly 10 of its
divisions, the acquisition is hardly a model for future overseas advances.
Company sources in the UK say that Northern expected the synergy between the
Canadian and UK transmission businesses to yield more than it has.
Expectations of its value as an entree to the continent were also overblown,
with the continent far less welcoming to overseas suppliers than the '1992'
hype of the late-1980s led Northern to expect.
'In retrospect, Northern's main gain from STC was a UK base with a sales
force they can use to sell their own product lines,' says Mr Larkin.
He points to Northern's joint venture with Matra, the French electronics
group, and its current negotiations with Bosch for a similar arrangement, as
showing that it now views direct investment in local partners as the best
way into individual EC markets - yielding the advantages of access and local
facilities without the up-front cost or the hassle of managing unfamiliar
businesses as part of an acquisition.
Mr Ian Craig, Northern's European director, implicitly accepts this,
stressing partnerships as the way of the future. 'We have 20 partners across
the continent, five in joint ventures, and we intend to build on that.'
Northern insists it has no plans to withdraw further from the UK. The
switching, transmission, radio/microwave and integrated networks divisions
of the former STC are now 'fully integrated' into Northern's product
divisions. Mr Craig says earnings from the UK operation are about 25 per
cent up on last year and orders nearly a third ahead.
For Alcatel, which already has a thriving undersea cable division, the
purchase of STC Submarine Systems exemplifies the policy of 'niche'
acquisition to bolster existing strengths. STC's success in the North
American market, in which AT&amp;T is a powerful competitor, will complement
Alcatel's position in the Mediterranean region and leave the new alliance
well placed to dominate the undersea cable market.
For the UK, however, Alcatel's move puts in the balance the survival of an
undersea cable business with an integrated R&amp;D and manufacturing capacity.
At present, STC Submarine Systems makes laboratory prototypes and carries
out basic research at an R&amp;D centre in Harlow; component engineering takes
place at Paignton; and systems engineering and manufacture of advanced
prototypes take place at its Greenwich base in London.
Only Greenwich goes with the sale to Alcatel. To keep access to the
fibre-optic research for its transmission products, Northern Telecom is
retaining the Harlow and Paignton facilities. The submarine cables division
will be given continued access to them through an arms-length service
agreement, but of necessity that arrangement can only be short-term.
What then? 'I only hope that Alcatel will keep an integrated research and
manufacturing capability in the UK, otherwise they will get nothing for
their investment,' says Dr Saul Lanyado, STC Submarine System's managing
director. Alcatel has yet to decide what to do, but such a course is far
from certain, given the company's R&amp;D capacity in France and the fact that
the sale itself destroys the integrated UK capability.
Meanwhile, a share in GPT, the last of the main UK-based telecoms suppliers,
has been sold by GEC, its parent, to Siemens, the German electronics group,
which is thought to be keen to buy the remainder.
If that happens, and STC Submarine Systems is broken up, Britain's telecoms
equipment industry will be predominantly a manufacturing outpost for
overseas companies. That would be perverse, given the UK's position at the
forefront of the international telecoms services industry.
And it is only four years since STC was toying with joining a consortium to
buy GEC - from which it would have got GPT.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Higher US sales revive GM
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday underscored the improving US vehicle market and the
fruits of its profit restoration effort in North America by reporting second
quarter net income of Dollars 889m.
The figure, which worked through at 92 cents a share, compared with a loss
of Dollars 703.2m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, in the same period of last year,
when the company took a Dollars 749m restructuring charge at its GM Hughes
Aircraft subsidiary. Sales were up 3.9 per cent at Dollars 36.7bn.
GM is in the throes of a huge cost-cutting programme in its key North
American vehicle operations, which last year lost Dollars 4.5bn on the basis
of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).
It said yesterday it was on target to achieve break-even on an EBIT basis in
North America this year. In the second quarter it made Dollars 675m, against
a loss of Dollars 298m, and for the first half its earnings totalled Dollars
1.2bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 2.49bn.
However, the second half of the year, which involves many model changes, is
usually tougher and GM faces potentially difficult negotiations with the
United Auto Workers union.
On a net income basis, its North American operations were still Dollars 95m
in the red in the second quarter, down from Dollars 761m.
GM's share of the US vehicle market dipped to 34.8 per cent, against 35.5
per cent a year earlier. It had cut less profitable sales to hire-car
companies.
Its international automobile operations earned Dollars 368m, up from Dollars
284m, helped by a strong sales and financial performance in Latin America.
Its European operations were profitable, despite the severe downturn in many
continental markets, although profits were lower.
Mr Rick Wagoner, chief financial officer, said the European market might be
close to the bottom. But it could bump along there for some time, with
recovery only beginning in late 1994.
The group's financial services business, General Motors Acceptance
Corporation, contributed Dollars 285m of income, while GM Hughes Electronics
made Dollars 232m, against a loss of Dollars 597m after special charges. The
Electronic Data Systems subsidiary rose to Dollars 178m.
For the first half, GM recorded net income of Dollars 1.4bn, against a loss
of Dollars 21.7bn - mostly a non-cash accounting charge.

<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday reported its last set of results
including Zeneca, its bioscience business.
Shorn of Zeneca and its fibres operations, sold to Du Pont, first-half
profits before tax and exceptional items rose from Pounds 146m to Pounds
167m. Trading profits were up from Pounds 149m to Pounds 180m.
The results benefited from currency movements and cost savings. Mr Ronnie
Hampel, chief executive, said: 'I regard the performance as solid in very
difficult circumstances.' For many of the businesses, the trading
environment continued to be tough. It was essential to pursue restructuring
programmes vigorously.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Zeneca makes debut with 41% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, the bioscience group floated by Imperial Chemical Industries,
yesterday reported a 41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits as part of its
first set of results.
The pre-tax figure advanced from Pounds 261m to Pounds 367m for the six
months to June 30. Zeneca's shares gained 24p to 646p.
The company, which manufactures pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and
speciality chemicals, reported sales up 13 per cent from Pounds 2.06bn to
Pounds 2.32bn.
Profits and sales benefited from sterling's devaluation. Group trading
profits increased 26 per cent to Pounds 412m, of which 7 per cent was
generated by underlying volume growth, 3 per cent by price increases and 16
per cent by cost cuts and exchange rates movements.
The pharmaceuticals division's trading profits advanced 34 per cent to
Pounds 302m, on sales up 22 per cent to Pounds 924m. Underlying volume
growth was 7 per cent.
The division benefited from its exposure to the hospital drugs market which
did not suffer as much as the general practitioner market in Germany, Italy
or the US.
Sales of Tenormin, Zeneca's best-selling drug, fell 22 per cent to Pounds
242m, following the expiry of US patents. The decline was more than offset
by new products.
Mr David Barnes, chief executive, said he was looking at a range of options
in pharmaceuticals, including joint research and development, product swaps,
co-marketing deals, and mergers and acquisitions. The group was examining
additional links with biotechnology groups.
Agrochemicals reported trading profits down 11 per cent to Pounds 85m, on
sales up from Pounds 748m to Pounds 825. At constant exchange rates,
turnover fell 3 per cent.
A 4 per cent rise in agrochemicals sales in the US was offset by a decline
in Europe generated by a collapse in the German and French markets, down 40
per cent and 25 per cent respectively - both hit by CAP reforms.
Earnings per share were 33.3p, against 24.6p. The first interim dividend is
10.5p.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Lex buys Arlington for Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEX Service is consolidating its position as the UK's largest car
distribution and leasing company by acquiring the Arlington group of 36 car
and truck dealerships from Unigate for Pounds 49.5m in cash, including the
repayment of Pounds 20m in debt.
The acquisition will push up the number of Lex car, van and truck
dealerships to 129, well on the way to the group's target of 150 and
significantly more than its main rivals, Inchcape, Hartwell, AFG, and T
Cowie, according to figures supplied by Automotive Management magazine.
It will increase Lex's share of the new car market in the UK to 3.6 per
cent, from 3.1 per cent.
The deal, to be completed tomorrow, is also an important step for Unigate,
which has been refocusing its business on food and distribution. The
proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt, with gearing expected to
drop to about 43 per cent, from 60 per cent.
It comes less than three months after Unigate was forced to postpone the
public offering of Black-eyed Pea and Taco Bueno, its US restaurant chains,
after the two reported poor sales in March and April. That move had been
expected to raise between Dollars 220m and Dollars 250m.
Arlington is the UK's 12th largest dealership group, ranked by volume,
selling 9,200 new cars and trucks in the year to March 31, when it posted a
pre-tax profit before Pounds 800,000 of exceptional items of Pounds 3m on
sales of Pounds 262m.
Commenting on the acquisition yesterday, Sir Trevor Chinn, Lex chairman,
said: 'The Arlington group is particularly valuable to us because of its
scale and geographic fit with our dealerships and because it adds a number
of key franchises which we wish to develop.'
Last year Lex expanded its dealership network with the acquisition of Swan
National from the TSB. Last week, it announced it was re-entering the import
business by acquiring a controlling interest in a joint venture which will
have the exclusive right to import Hyundai cars.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Allied to acquire Augustus Barnett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the UK's biggest brewer, yesterday confirmed that it is negotiating
the sale of its Augustus Barnett off-licence chain to Allied-Lyons, the
food, drinks and retailing group.
The long-rumoured deal, worth about Pounds 40m according to industry
estimates, would consolidate Allied's position as the country's
second-largest specialist drinks retailer, combining its 970 Victoria Wine
outlets with Augustus Barnett's 540 shops.
Whitbread's Thresher chain, boosted by the Pounds 49.5m acquisition of 667
Peter Dominic outlets from Grand Metropolitan two years ago, is the leading
retailer with 1,600 shops and a 10 per cent share of the take-home drinks
market.
The merger of Victoria Wine and Augustus Barnett would give Allied an 8.6
per cent market share, well ahead of other specialists such as Oddbins and
Cellar 5 with shares of under 2 per cent.
It would increase sales opportunities for its spirits and beer brands,
improve its purchasing power and enable it to compete more effectively
against the grocery multiples.
The merged chain would be particularly strong in Scotland, where it would
have 330 shops.
Bass is expected to secure a supply agreement for its beers as part of the
deal.
The take-home trade is now one of the fastest-growing sectors of the beer
market, accelerated by the focus on value for money during the recession and
the decline in numbers of younger pub-goers. It is expected to increase its
20 per cent share of total beer sales to 30 per cent by the end of the
decade.
Specialist off-licences have encountered aggressive competition in recent
years from supermarkets, led by J Sainsbury and Tesco, each of which has
raised market share above 9 per cent.
According to Verdict, the market researcher, food retailers - helped by
Sunday opening and evening trading - have captured about half the Pounds 6bn
market for take-home drinks.
The specialist off-licences have been hitting back, however. Victoria Wine
recorded sales growth of 6 per cent last year by providing a greater range
of drinks brands, and by focusing on customer research and service. Augustus
Barnett has been relocating to larger premises.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Probe launched into perjury claims in VW-Opel battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN prosecutors have started investigating suspicions that Volkswagen
director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others may have committed
perjury, and speculation grew yesterday that he could soon be charged in
connection with allegations of industrial espionage.
Hamburg state prosecutors confirmed the opening of an investigation
following suggestions that they should examine discrepancies between
testimony and affidavits presented in evidence at a recent civil hearing.
The hearing related to the continuing clash between VW and Adam Opel, the
General Motors German subsidiary. Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice-president of GM
Europe, said yesterday he felt that prosecutors had enough evidence for
criminal charges.
'The public prosecutors' office, following thorough examination and
investigation, confirms that (Opel's) suspicions are justified. According to
its own statements, the office has made 'decisive' progress,' he said.
Meanwhile, the federal government was asked to mediate in the battle, and a
senior official in the Bonn economics ministry urged the state of Lower
Saxony to sell its 19.7 per cent stake in VW.
Mr Reinhard Gohner, state secretary, criticised Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime
minister of Lower Saxony, for defending VW managers, and said it was
inappropriate for politicians to be involved. The spying row was damaging
the image of German industry and could be fatal if it was not resolved soon,
he said.
Mr Klaus Bregger, head of the influential MIT association, which represents
medium-sized companies, appealed to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, federal economics
minister, to act as a mediator. He reminded the minister that every sixth
job in Germany depended on the motor industry.
Concern over the case soared yesterday following claims this week from Mr
Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, that he was at war with GM, and indirect
allegations that incriminating evidence against Mr Lopez and his colleagues
had been planted.
Mr Gab rejected as 'grotesque' Mr Piech's charges that Opel, an 'American'
company, was seeking to destroy VW. Opel ensured employment for 400,000
people in Germany, he said.
He said Mr Piech, an Austrian, who did not carry a German passport, was
mobilising national sentiments in his host country in a manner that
'burdened' German industry as a whole. The VW chairman's attitude reflected
a 'psychosis-like bunker mentality', Mr Gab added.
The suggestion of a perjury probe came from lawyers of Adam Opel.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Italian bribes Pounds 54m alleged: Payments linked to
Enimont chemicals venture, says magazine

<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS that bribes worth L130bn (Pounds 54m) were paid to Italy's top
politicians and businessmen during the 1989-90 reorganisation of the
chemicals industry last night injected an explosive new element into the
country's 18-month-old corruption scandals.
The payments were allegedly made on the orders of the late Mr Raul Gardini,
then chairman of Montedison, the Ferruzzi group's chemicals arm.
The details were released by the weekly magazine L'Espresso, which will
publish a full account at the weekend. The magazine's revelations were
partly backed up yesterday by a series of warnings issued by investigating
magistrates to politicians and businessmen involved.
The alleged payments were first related to Mr Gardini's efforts to gain
control of Enimont, the chemicals joint venture with Eni, the state oil
concern. Further bribes were paid when Montedison received the L2,805bn
payment for its 40 per cent stake in Enimont from Eni, as well as over the
way Eni agreed to buy the outstanding 20 per cent of shares, largely in the
hands of Mr Gardini's supporters.
The politicians involved include most of the then senior figures in the
ruling five-party coalition - Mr Arnaldo Forlani, then leader of the
Christian Democrat Party; Mr Bettino Craxi, then leader of the Socialist
Party; Mr Claudio Martelli, then Socialist deputy premier; Mr Cirino
Pomicino, a senior Christian Democrat minister; Mr Carlo Vizzini, then
leader of the Social Democrats; Mr Renato Altissimo, then leader of the
Liberals and Mr Giorgio La Malfa, then leader of the Republicans.
Until now magazine extracts relating to the corruption scandals have been
accurate and apparently unofficially endorsed by the investigating
magistrates.
Both Mr Forlani and Mr Pomicino yesterday admitted they had been warned they
were under investigation for the Enimont affair. Mr Forlani was alleged in
the warning to have received L35bn on behalf of his party.
Mr Forlani claimed the allegations were false as did Mr Craxi, Mr La Malfa
and Mr Pomicino. Mr Craxi was alleged to have received L1.5bn.
According to L'Espresso, 70 per cent of the bribes were split between the
Christian Democrats and Socialists, with the rest going to individual
politicians, middlemen and employees of Eni. Among these was allegedly the
late Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman who committed suicide in jail
two weeks ago.
Mr Gardini also committed suicide. In testimony to Milan magistrates, Mr
Giuseppe Garofano, the then chief executive of Montedison and Mr Carlo Sama,
another senior management figure - both currently in jail - are alleged to
have said Mr Gardini was obliged to pay the bribes to ensure the success of
the deal for Montedison.

<TEXT>
The cloak and dagger intrigue surrounding Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua's move from General Motors to Volkswagen has certainly caused a
head-on collision. But as yet his departure has not even scratched the
paintwork of GM's financial performance. Despite the spluttering US economic
recovery GM seems to be on target to break even on its North American
operations this year. While unsatisfactory, that is at least a significant
improvement on the Dollars 11bn-worth of losses in 1991 and 1992.
General Motors has a long way to go - its vehicles, for example, still cost
some Dollars 800 more each than Ford's to produce. Yet heavy cost-cutting
seems to be having an effect and GM's gross margins rose by 1.9 percentage
points in the first half of 1993. The company is also starting to
rationalise the duplication in areas such as component design, so that
engineers will have to select from a limited set of standard parts. Not all
of the restructuring is negative. GM is putting the experience of its
Japanese-style Saturn plant to work elsewhere in the group, and it is
gaining market share as it produces more attractive models.
In part, the company has been helped by the strength of the yen, which has
made Japanese imports less attractive.
That has given GM an extra breathing space it scarcely deserved. Whether the
company and its workforce are really determined to capitalise on the
opportunity may show more clearly in the negotiations for a three-year pay
deal this autumn.

FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The millionaire moguls of the television sector have again demonstrated
their penny pinching skills, enabling LWT to widen half-year trading margins
by 7 percentage points to 26.6 per cent. Despite a minimal rise in
advertising revenue, LWT's assault on costs produced a 20 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits. However, the scope to trim costs further is diminishing.
Earnings growth will increasingly depend on pushing more work through its
studios and boosting advertising income. But both tasks will be tough in
today's sticky trading climate. Moreover, when the preferred shares convert
next month, the dividend cover is likely to be set at between two and 2 1/2
times. That is hardly generous for such a cash generative business.
LWT's recent share price rise, though, owes more to speculative appeal than
trading outlook or prospective yield. Granada's acquisition of a 20 per cent
stake at a premium price seemingly emphasises LWT's worth as a bid target.
Yet this theory may prove suspect if, as Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's
chairman, believes, the balance of probability has now swung against a
change of rules permitting the big nine franchises to devour each other. On
this view, many television shares, including LWT's, look decidedly heavy.

FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: ICI/Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after the plan to demerge Zeneca from ICI was unveiled, the issues
facing the businesses have barely changed. The outlook for agrochemicals now
housed in Zeneca remains at best patchy as the reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy takes its toll. Sales of Tenormin, the biggest drug in
the pharmaceuticals business, are still falling following the expiry of its
US patent. ICI's petrochemicals business is struggling against poor margins.
Slow recovery in the US and deteriorating prospects in Europe continue to
postpone a bounce in profits from paints, explosives and industrial
materials.
After yesterday's bounce in the shares, though, the combined worth of ICI
and Zeneca has risen by 8 per cent over the year. The passage of time might
take some of the credit: European agrochemicals may be through the worst by
the end of this year, as should the decline of Tenormin. Sales figures for
Zeneca's new drugs increasingly support the notion that decent sales growth
in pharmaceuticals can be maintained despite cost-cutting measures from
governments. There is also the small matter of sterling's devaluation, worth
Pounds 50m to ICI in the first half.
Since the economic cycle is unlikely to offer much immediate help - and
exchange rates could take an adverse lurch - progress from here will rely on
management action. The product swaps and cost cutting undertaken by ICI show
the right mix of imagination and rigour. More of the same on both sides of
the business is now required to justify the decision to split.

FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Twilight of the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to see what can hold the ERM together after yesterday's
Bundesbank refusal to cut its discount rate. The bank's decision looks odd
after Wednesday's cut in its repurchase rate and leaves the impression of
wide disagreements within its central council. But the clear message is that
most council members remain in favour of putting domestic considerations
first.
That is, after all, logical. Had the Bundesbank cut its discount rate for
the second time in a month just to save the French franc, its credibility as
the guardian of sound money would have suffered serious damage. There is
little in Germany's domestic situation to justify further relaxation.
Inflation and money supply growth remain excessive. Significantly, the
German bond market weakened when a cut was expected ahead of yesterday's
meeting, a sign that financial markets were worried about the inflationary
consequences of premature easing.
The days of self-delusion are, however, past. German rates will not come
down far enough or fast enough to refloat the French economy. The peseta,
escudo and the Danish krone look more immediately threatened. But barring a
miracle it looks only a matter of time before the French franc's position in
the ERM is untenable too. Intervention on yesterday's scale cannot continue
indefinitely, especially since that would once again put German money supply
targets out of reach.
Today's French unemployment data may determine the timing of the final
denouement. Thereafter the market would be back to judging currencies on
their fundamentals. Comparison with the franc might then quickly put the
mighty D-Mark in a much less favourable light. Yesterday it was already
falling sharply against the dollar.

Bad luck for Inter-Continental Hotels that on the day that it announced it
was returning to Beirut, after an 18-year absence, Israel sent an armoured
column including tanks and personnel carriers into south Lebanon.
Fortunately, the 600-room Phoenicia Inter-Continental which used to be the
Middle East's premier hostelry, is not scheduled to reopen until January
1995 - by which time there might be a more permanent ceasefire.

As the Bundesbank snootily left its all-important discount rate untouched
yesterday, it was all too much for Europe's pressured finance officials.
Asked about a possible devaluation of the krone, Danish central bank chief
Erik Hoffmeyer snapped: 'I absolutely exclude it. American bankers will not
be allowed to decide our monetary policy.'
American bankers? Not many of those in the upper echelons of Buba. No,
Hoffmeyer - who obviously has a long memory - could be thinking of Robin
Marshall, the thoroughly English, Oxford-educated chief economist of Chase
in London who paid the Danes a visit back in February.
Marshall, who was greeted at the airport by hordes of journalists and was
taken aback at the interest his trip aroused, made the point that punishing
domestic interest rate levels suggested the krone was ripe for devaluation,
if not outright suspension from the ERM.
No country likes foreigners being rude about its currency, and the Danes
acted particularly wounded. The stock market duly fell. But the local press
comforted itself with the thought that the view was typical 'of the
islanders who are biased by the pound's unworthy exit from the EMS', and
perhaps only to be expected from a graduate of one of 'the right British
universities'.

ICI is patently glad to be shot of its bio-science operations; it passed off
Zeneca, its Pounds 4bn offshoot, merely as a 'discontinued business'.
Industry journalists can only agree. As the two companies' results briefings
will no longer coincide, there will also be no occasion for Zeneca to ply
unsuspecting hacks with the company's meat-substitute, Quorn, in between

Martin Wygod, who is selling his Medco pill distribution business to Merck,
is one of the shrewdest financial promoters around. He has also become a fly
in the ointment for US pharmaceuticals companies so it's no surprise that
Merck has had to pay Dollars 6bn to catch him and his business.
By standing up to the drugs companies on behalf of some of the biggest
buyers of pharmaceuticals, Medco won discounts of up to 25 per cent. Hence
it was unnerving for big drugs purchasers to see Wygod canoodling with
Merck, the biggest drugs producer.
For Wygod, at least, it is good news. He will get Dollars 61m in Merck
shares, have options over another Dollars 37m, and plans to buy another
Dollars 30m or so of Merck paper. And he promises Medco will remain fiercely
independent, buying only the best and cheapest drugs around, regardless of
whether they have the Merck stamp on them.
The deal also throws up another interesting name. Richard Braddock, 50,
ex-president of Citicorp, only took over from 53-year-old Wygod as Medco's
chief executive last December. Given that Richard Markham, Merck's heir
apparent, resigned a fortnight ago, will Braddock now be a contender for the
top job at Merck? Or will he return to banking?
His name was mentioned when American Express was looking for a replacement
for Jimmy Robinson. So perhaps he could be a candidate to fill the chief
executive slot at Barclays. It certainly seems to be taking a long time to
find someone.

It is hard to believe that the Lord Rees-Mogg behind today's High Court
ruling on the Maastricht treaty is the same Rees-Mogg who used to edit The
Times when it really did speak for the establishment.
There was one celebrated occasion at the start of 1972 when the great editor
led his newspaper with a banner headline declaring that 'The Times is a
European newspaper' - rather than filling the front page with the usual diet
of mere news. This odd decision prompted Owen Hickey, then the paper's chief
leader-writer, to proclaim that he had always been brought up to believe The
Times was a world newspaper.
Perhaps Rees-Mogg, now back with The Times as a humble columnist, has
belatedly come round to that view.

If only Chris Patten were still around. How often one hears top Tories
bemoan the loss of the former party chairman to the colonies. Patten was the
one man who could articulate what the prime minister stood for. Since he
left for Hong Kong no one has really filled his spot.
So it came as a surprise to find him in London yesterday addressing a
conference organised by The Tablet, a Catholic weekly, rather than the
voters of Christchurch, on a subject close to Tory hearts - Hope.
He admitted the topic was unfashionable: 'Why speak of Hope in July of all
months? July: the February of summer, heavy with all the fag-ends of
politics, winding wearily on and petering sullenly out. In July, Hope is
invariably dashed like the waves on a stern and rock-bound coast.'
Nevertheless, it was an upbeat speech. Sensibly he did not address the
question of whether there was any hope for the government he had left
behind.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY must judge whether the Bundesbank's actions of the past few years
will eventually confirm, or undermine, its economic reputation as Europe's
most accomplished central bank. For the moment, the only conclusion that can
be drawn from its baffling behaviour of the past few days is that the
Bundesbank's public relations skills are woefully lacking. Its decision to
allow Europe's highly-strung foreign exchange markets to infer that a
discount rate cut was imminent and then leave the rate unchanged appears, at
best, incompetent.
The Bundesbank has achieved one thing for which it should not be criticised:
no one can now accuse the bank of putting the preservation of the European
exchange rate mechanism before its prime task of achieving medium-term
stability.
Whether German interests do, indeed, militate against a further cut in
short-term rates appears highly questionable. The suspicion remains that,
after a sharp recession and when the yield curve is inverted, the bank's
determination to set policy by contemporaneous inflation and monetary
indicators may prove a serious mistake.
But the Bundesbank can and should be criticised for a series of actions
which have served to feed the frenetic instability in Europe's money
markets. Why, if the Bundesbank did not intend to cut the discount rate
yesterday, did it unexpectedly reduce the highly sensitive repo rate the day
before? And why has it felt no obligation publicly to explain its actions?
One answer may be that a full explanation is too unpalatable for its council
members to express. For Germany is no longer the strong and stable low
inflation country that it once was.
This fact is at the root of the current difficulties. Fixed exchange rate
systems work well when all the members of the zone are affected similarly by
the same economic problems. They perform less well when some countries have
special economic problems which require a different policy mix: that is why
the UK and Italy were forced to leave the ERM last autumn, and why Spain is
now under such pressure. But fixed systems perform disastrously when the
anchor currency also joins the problem category.
The ERM's difficulties stem from the fact that Germany has structural budget
problems and an inflation rate currently more than twice as high as that of
France and Belgium and four times that of Denmark. For Germany, that will
continue to mean high short-term interest rates. For its low inflation
partners, it means ever higher real interest rates. The result is the
unnecessarily deep recessions they are now suffering.
An ERM re-alignment would offer no realistic prospect of relief. While
Germany remains the ERM anchor, it will continue to set the interest rates
floor and the markets will continue to bet on whether the low inflation
countries will be forced to breach it. A better solution might be for
Germany to recognise that it - not France or Denmark - is the country with
structural problems and so needs, temporarily, to leave the ERM. The only
other option for these low inflation countries is to try to sweat the summer
out. That means continuing to lose foreign exchange reserves while trusting
the Bundesbank to intervene and the big speculative players to stay away.
They may yet succeed. But at what price?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past week, the battle between General Motors and Volkswagen has
escalated into a commercial war of a bitterness without parallel in recent
memory. What on earth is it all about? One suggested cause can surely be
ruled out: that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whose defection to VW
sparked it all off, is a manager of irreplaceable talent. His record in
cutting GM's costs in Europe is undeniable. But it must be absurd to suppose
that the gap between him and the nearest equivalent from GM's three quarters
of a million workforce is wide enough to account for the scale of the
dispute.
There is an altogether murkier alternative. GM, like VW, is engaged on
developing a small car for the world market. Historically, the car industry
has been unusual in its dependence on new models and the secrecy in which
they are enveloped. But the level of aggression between GM and VW suggests
there is more at stake than the shape of the boot or the design of the
dashboard. GM has toiled for years to transform itself from a
mass-production dinosaur to a flexible lean producer on the Japanese model.
What if, for instance, GM has come up with genuine cost-saving innovations
on the production line as a result of its labours on the multi-billion
Saturn project?
This is speculation, and is likely to remain so. Were GM to have any such
innovations up its sleeve, it would scarcely be ready to share them with the
world's press. But the idea would fit the accusations GM levels at Mr Lopez:
that - for example - he requisitioned data from GM amounting to 90,000
sheets of paper, and that he tried to poach another seven top GM employees.
VW's counter-accusations, lurid though they sound, merit serious
consideration. Their main thrust is that GM has sought to plant commercial
secrets in VW's computer system as a means of incriminating Mr Lopez: and
that boxes of secret data found in a flat formerly occupied by defecting GM
executives were planted by persons unknown or by GM itself. But that would
imply that GM felt so threatened by Mr Lopez's managerial talents as to hand
over sensitive commercial data in order to discredit him.
In a case so bafflingly short of facts, the field is open to speculation.
But two conclusions are clear. The first is that this dispute is getting to
the point where both managements stand to suffer serious damage. The second
is that the passionate commitment of both parties is clear evidence of an
industry in trouble. The underlying issue has to do with declining sales and
chronic overcapacity in the world car market. The more clamorous the
argument, the more cause the car industry has to worry.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Leading Article: A right to privacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE fundamental difficulties in defining a right to privacy in English
law, as successive inquiries, reports and private members' bills on the
subject have discovered. A government considering legislation on privacy
should proceed warily and consult on the widest possible basis. Yesterday's
green paper on privacy should therefore be welcomed for its comprehensive
and scholarly examination of this thorny issue.
Less welcome, however, is its recommendation of a civil remedy in law for
people whose privacy is infringed. It is true, as the green paper argues,
that 'a society which permits individuals to choose how they are to lead
their lives is one which will recognise the choice of privacy'. But privacy
is a complex subject: people need - or want - different amounts of privacy.
And the right to privacy cannot be unconditional: people in public life must
accept some loss of privacy in return for high office and popular esteem.
For these reasons, the green paper sensibly rejects an absolute right to
privacy. But its proposed remedy against conduct which would infringe a
person's privacy is scarcely better. Such a remedy must be open to a public
interest defence, especially in a country where the media enjoy no
constitutional right of free expression. The green paper suggests that
matters falling into the public interest category would include 'seriously
anti-social conduct' and 'the discharge of a public function'. Would the
recent behaviour of some politicians or members of the royal family fit into
these definitions?
And since there would be no access to legal aid in enforcing the proposed
tort of privacy, only the rich would be able to use it. Mr Robert Maxwell
and Mr Asil Nadir would undoubtedly have had the resources to use such
provisions, unlike the widow of an IRA victim hounded by the press.
Public concern over infringements of privacy has abated recently, partly
because of increasing suspicion that politicians would like greater
protection from public scrutiny. Some of the more notorious allegations
about the great and the good have been subsequently justified by events. In
any case, the level of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission
suggests that intrusion is less common than many suppose: just 109
admissible complaints on privacy were received in the 18-month period to
July 1992.
That there have been quite unjustifiable and egregious infringements of the
privacy of individuals is undeniable. But many of these might be better
dealt with by tightening up on the laws of trespass and telephone tapping.
Until those avenues have been fully explored, the case for legislation on
privacy has yet to be made.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Critics cause a ripple in the pool: Pressures to reform the
pricing policies of England and Wales's electricity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arcane and complex operation of England and Wales's electricity pool,
the wholesale market through which power is traded, is not a subject on
which much light is regularly thrown. The complex trading system leaves most
observers in the dark. But when Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, publishes a review of prices today, its role and future strategy
will be under the spotlight in a bout of public scrutiny.
At issue is the future shape of the pool and, potentially, the survival in
their present form of National Power and PowerGen, two of the UK's largest
companies which help to run it. Prof Littlechild has warned that, if not
satisfied with explanations from the two big generators about rises of up to
20 per cent in pool prices this year, he may refer them to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Though a referral is unlikely for some months, today's report is likely to
criticise the generators and strengthen Prof Littlechild's belief that
reforms to the system are needed. He is not alone in this.
Prompted by the lobbying of industrial energy users, which are the main
victims of the price rises, the government is considering plans to enable
some of them to bypass the pool and buy directly from 'dedicated'
generators. This would have significant implications for most domestic
electricity consumers who may see prices rise because they would have to pay
a larger share of administration costs.
Pool managers and the electricity companies have already set up their own
review of operations to take the heat out of the debate. They are looking at
how the system can be simplified, and whether changes should be made in
transmission services and the bidding system which sets prices. Initial
findings are expected in the autumn.
The focus of attention is the trading system set up when the government
privatised the electricity industry three years ago. The pool is run by
executives appointed by the electricity companies. It is not a physical
stock of electricity. Instead, it is a mechanism for setting electricity
prices.
After weighing up supply, which is made available at varying prices by
generating companies, and demand, it sets the price of electricity for each
half-hour period of the next day. Without it, or something like it, there
would be too much or too little electricity at any one time.
On a practical level, the pool has worked well. Electricity has been
dispatched to where it is needed. As Prof Littlechild observes: 'The lights
have stayed on.' Ministers note that most small industrial and household
customers have benefited from lower prices since introduction of the pool.
This is because their electricity needs have been covered by fixed-price
'hedging' contracts between generators and regional electricity companies,
set several years ahead. Short-term changes in the pool price do not affect
most consumers.
But for large users buying directly from the pool, the latest price
increases follow the end of a scheme which, until privatisation, provided
them with cheap electricity generated from cut-price coal.
The effect of the scheme's demise and pool price rises is demonstrated at
Imperial Chemical Industries' chlorine plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, where
power costs have risen by 70 per cent in the past two years. Plant managers
believe they need to fall 40 per cent to bring costs into line with
international competitors. Otherwise, they say, the long-term future of the
site is in danger.
Such large users are particularly irked because the pool increases come when
fuel costs are falling as a result of British Coal price cuts.
PowerGen and National Power argue that some of the price rise has been
beyond their control, resulting from difficulties with the computer software
which calculates prices, and disruptions to the grid caused by smaller
generating companies being connected to it.
National Power agrees that the prices it demands from the pool have risen
since April, because contracts fixed at privatisation, which kept pool
prices artificially low, ended in March. 'Today's bid prices reflect more
realistically the cost of electricity production,' says Mr John Baker, chief
executive.
The complexity of the pool's operation makes argument against the generators
an arduous task. 'It is difficult for an outsider to assess how the bid of a
particular plant will affect the pool price,' according to one large
electricity buyer. 'The generators, on the other hand, with a wealth of
experience of the system, can design bids to achieve their particular aims.'
The suggestion is that the generators have used their muscle in the market
to push up pool prices. But they deny they abuse the system. While Prof
Littlechild's report will help resolve the matter, some large industrial
users believe a more effective way of reducing prices would be to persuade
ministers to allow them to bypass the pool and buy direct from the
generators. With pool-associated costs, including administration, amounting
to 20 per cent of the final cost of a typical large user's power bill, the
savings could be considerable.
Intensive energy users justify their case by saying the costs of running the
system are mainly associated with fluctuating demand, for which they blame
mainly domestic users. Heavy, continuous process industries, such as
pharmaceuticals, tend to want constant amounts of electricity each hour of
each day of the year. 'Why should we pay for services, including expensive
reserves, which are needed because others have less predictable demand?'
asks Dr Richard Wills, an economist at the Major Energy Users' Council,
representing large consumers. 'The innocent are paying for the actions of
the guilty.'
However, Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, says that, if
bypassing the pool means paying no pool-associated charges, 'then it isn't
on. The domestic customer would pay. We can try to charge on a fairer basis
but the pool cannot be used to provide subsidies.' She says she hopes the
pool's internal review will make bypassing irrelevant. In it, the aims of
participants vary, but they appear to agree the system should be made
simpler and more transparent.
The case for change is summarised by Prof Littlechild: 'The more
transparency you have the more effective and competitive a market you have.
If participants believe a market is open and simple they are more likely to
find it satisfactory.'
One way to simplify the market would be to abolish the system whereby
generators provide five different prices for each individual generating unit
of each power station. 'There ought to be a simpler way,' says Mrs Thompson.
'The engineers say it is important that the information is there. The
question is whether the information needs to feed into how the prices are
set.'
Most intensive energy users are more interested in another proposal being
considered by the pool: whether it is prepared to accept 'demand-side
bidding' proposals. These would provide payments for electricity users who
agree to reduce their consumption when the load on the system is high.
Among the advantages of such bidding are greater predictability of demand
and a cost reduction. Pool executive members are concerned this would be a
back-door method of cutting prices for large users. 'I'm not sure that
agreeing not to take electricity, in effect doing nothing, is a service
which demands payment,' said one. 'However it might be a more perfect market
if demand-side bidding was introduced.'
The third area under review by the pool involves transmission services,
including whether the National Grid, which runs the electricity system, can
be provided with new incentives to cut costs.
Under existing arrangements, the grid passes on all the costs of
administering the pool to customers. It has suggested a complicated reform,
backed by hedging contracts with electricity companies, under which it would
increase its exposure to risk but would expect to make a profit from doing
so.
Interesting though the idea may be, the calculations on which is it based do
not have the quality of simplicity. That is the problem for most of the
options under consideration by the pool. 'The fact is that people are
talking at cross purposes,' says an insider. 'It is highly unlikely that you
can introduce new rules and expect simplification at the same time.'
Given the complexities and the need for consensus, the pool is likely to
take several months to implement any reforms. In the meantime, prices show
no signs of falling. Pressure for action by the pool or the government is
not likely to ease; nor is speculation about the generators' bidding
behaviour and a potential monopolies reference.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Personal View: A picture of a more open BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT BALDWIN and MARTIN CAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent turmoil at the BBC stems largely from its attempt to introduce
radical management changes with more haste than finesse. But the process of
change is being made more difficult by the BBC's confusing constitutional
structure.
The basic problem is that the board of governors combines regulatory and
managerial functions. Moreover, the BBC lacks a well-defined framework of
objectives and performance indicators - obligations and aims are specified
throughout the Charter, the Licence and Agreement, legislation such as the
Broadcasting Act 1981 and even in the BBC's annual review, published on
Wednesday. The resultant package is too lacking in precision to offer a peg
for accountability to the viewing public.
If it is assumed that the BBC is to remain a single, coherent organisation
that serves the public interest by offering a broad range of distinctive
programmes, what should the structure be when the current Charter expires at
the end of 1996?
Most important, regulatory and executive functions should be separated. An
Office of Broadcasting (Ofbro) should be established, responsible by statute
for regulating the BBC's execution of its obligations, for approving its
strategy statement and for adjudicating on complaints. There are arguments
for and against combining within Ofbro the regulation of other broadcasting
channels, such as ITV, Channel 4 and cable and satellite. There may be
advantages in having one regulator for the whole industry rather than
several regulators, each enjoying a closer relationship with the
organisation it regulates.
The powers of Ofbro should attach either to a single regulator or to a board
appointed by the home secretary. The BBC as an executive body should be
headed by a chief executive responsible to a board of executive and
non-executive directors. It should be the BBC's function to devise
strategies for meeting obligations.
The new legal framework should be statutory as is the case in utilities
regulation. A Royal Charter may give a breadth of capacity that is not
offered by a statute, but this advantage means little to a body such as the
BBC which is also subject to a Licence and Agreement. A new Broadcasting Act
should set down the duties of Ofbro and the BBC. The home secretary should
continue to issue a licence to the BBC, which would be obliged to make a
periodic 'statement of strategy' setting out both how it sees its role and
how it proposes to implement its objectives. The statute would call on Ofbro
to approve the policy statement with amendments where necessary.
The agreed strategy statement would then be reflected in a set of
performance targets. Fortunately, television audience measurement makes it
possible to capture both numbers of viewers and how much they appreciate
individual programmes. It would therefore be natural to specify the BBC's
targets as a combination of quantity and quality and to link the pay and
tenure of the corporation's senior executives to the attainment of the
targets.
A regime in which the ultimate regulator (Ofbro) lacks accountability to
ministers depends on the openness of its procedures if it is to be seen as
legitimate. To some extent a separate regulator and a published 'statement
of strategy' offer more openness than applies at present, but performance
deficiencies may be due to poor execution, poor regulation or both. In a new
initiative, therefore, increased public funding should be made available for
a viewers' council, which would be empowered to report to the public on the
activities of both Ofbro and the BBC. For its part, parliament may see it as
appropriate to establish a standing committee on public service
broadcasting.
What is to be gained from such a revised system? First, an institutional
separation that encourages effective control and accountability. Second,
more openness in policy formulation and, as a result, greater responsiveness
in a rapidly changing environment. Third, increased powers for viewers'
representatives. Such arrangements are likely to enhance not merely
accountability and the fair treatment of viewers but also the potential of
the BBC to be seen to satisfy its mandate.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: EMS requires change - but not burial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIMOTHY J B WILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, the EMS certainly failed to provide a universal panacea for the
accumulated economic mismanagement of some countries. This does not mean
that the system or the more important aim of monetary union should be
declared dead. Austria has been able effectively to fix the schilling to the
D-Mark for decades, and the Netherlands for years. Some countries joined the
EMS without the reforms and track record the unleashed capital markets
demanded. The markets maintained their belief in the inability of
governments to fight inflation. It is against the interests of these huge
borrowers.
It is only with monetary union that the curtain of exchange rates can be
lifted and local competitiveness can show in local prices. Politicians would
no longer be able to hide their mistakes behind brave speeches of evil
speculators. The voter/consumer could see the effectiveness of government in
the prices they have to pay week in, week out.
It would be a great shame to let incompetence win again.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: EMS requires change - but not burial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK FOLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wholeheartedly agree with almost all of what the 'MIT Six' say in
their article, 'Why the EMS deserves an early burial' (Personal View, July
29). However, I don't believe that it is necessary to scrap completely the
exchange rate mechanism. In the June issue of Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin,
I set out a proposal for ERM reform, which would change the system into a
much more flexible one, based on central rates which are reassessed
regularly, perhaps by the new European Monetary Institution, to ensure that
they have not moved out of line with economic fundamentals.
Theory suggests, for instance, that German reunification required an
appreciation of the D-Mark. The Bundesbank apparently pushed for this as
early as 1989, but it was resisted by other ERM members. In the absence of a
D-Mark realignment, the relative price shift required for a real
appreciation could only be achieved by prices in Germany rising faster than
those elsewhere. Because the Bundesbank was, perhaps understandably, not
willing to allow a surge in German inflation, the result has been
disinflation elsewhere. In a system where central rates were determined by
reference to what was required for economic equilibrium, such deflationary
pressure would not arise; the D-Mark would have been realigned to take
account of the effect of reunification.
It is only by reform that the ERM will survive. Furthermore, I would argue
that reform is essential to allow progress towards a single currency. We see
in the latest German interest rate move confirmation that the Bundesbank
continues to put domestic considerations first. While understandable, it
makes it even less likely that the ERM will survive in its current form. But
that would be a good thing.

I may be wrong on this, but I would imagine that the German economy is

FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: Disquiet over competitive tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LESLEY COURCOUF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your recent article, 'Council contractors reduce tendering prices'
(July 9), claiming savings in second round compulsory competitive tendering
(CCT) contracts for refuse collection of upwards of 18 per cent has caused
more than a little disquiet.
The plain fact is that the research on which the report is based appears to
leave a good deal to be desired and the conclusions drawn are somewhat
suspect. Many of the authorities listed were displeased at being cited as
examples at this stage without consultation.
The Local Authority Associations have asked the Local Government Management
Board's CCT information service to carry out a detailed analysis of the
authorities quoted as examples from the recent CCT report by CDC Research.
Not one single reference has so far been found to be wholly accurate. For
instance, one authority mentioned that it is not actually due to re-tender
its contract until November 1995 and another has suspended its CCT programme
prior to the outcome of local government reorganisation and extended its
existing contract.
We have not named the authorities here because the LGMB database has a duty
of confidentiality to its members.
Even if the figures were accurate, one should not assume that the compulsory
tendering process in itself necessarily generates any savings. Any apparent
savings may be attributable to a range of factors including financial
pressures and changes to service specifications.
It is naive to assume that changes occurring over the period during which
CCT has operated have necessarily been brought about by CCT.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Street war against the skinheads: Two of a kind - How secret
service chiefs are coping with the post-cold war world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Germany is living in an unsafe new world, warns Mr Eckart Werthebach,
president of the German domestic security service, the Bundesamt fur
Verfassungsschutz (BfV) - Europe's most public relations-minded intelligence
agency.
In his airy office at the BfV's sprawling Cologne headquarters, Mr
Werthebach, a 52-year-old veteran security specialist, ranks as the
continent's chief hunter of spies, political extremists and assorted state
enemies.
His checked jacket and confidence-inspiring suntan give him the air of a
star clinical psychiatrist: a man who takes pride in precise observation of
derangement. With aplomb and, when required, humour, he analyses his own
anxieties about the changes since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
'Espionage has become less important,' says Mr Werthebach, in charge since
1991 of the BfV and its DM230m (Pounds 89m) annual budget. 'But, overall,
both Germany and the rest of Europe have become more unstable. So internal
security needs to be defended more than during the time when we had the two
power blocs - a situation which had a certain stabilising influence.'
Mr Werthebach's main concern is the rise of right-wing German extremist
violence, especially against foreigners. 'The threat comes no longer from
the east but from the overall wave of nationalism in Europe.' A recorded
total of 1,008 German far-right attacks claimed eight lives in the first
half of this year.
Most of these attacks were the responsibility of 6,400 'militant users of
force' (often skinhead groups) classified by the BfV as the most aggressive
of the 42,700 members of right-wing extremist parties and organisations.
Xenophobic violence endangers not just asylum-seekers, but also the state,
Mr Werthebach says. In best consulting room manner, he offers reassurance:
'They will not be able to eliminate our liberal democracy.'
Domestic extremists, together with agents of unfriendly foreign governments,
have always been the BfV's targets. The service (literally, federal office
for the protection of the constitution) was set up in 1950, with the aim of
collecting intelligence on adversaries of the freshly established West
German state.
To scotch any idea that the BfV itself uses anti-democratic methods, the
agency has an active public relations policy. One brochure contains a
diagram illustrating its methods, including secret photography, telephone
and post interception, infiltration and electronic eavesdropping.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Germans thought the BfV had
outlived its usefulness. The agency started to cut its 2,350 federal staff,
separate from a further 2,500 Verfassungsschutz employees in the states or
Lander. (Britain's secretive domestic security service, MI5, is smaller,
employing 2,000.)
In view of the need to deploy more resources against extremism, these plans
have now been reversed. 'In a few years, we will be back to our old level,'
Mr Werthebach says.
As far as spying is concerned, he says Russia is maintaining espionage under
the auspices of the SWR, the successor to the KGB. 'The personnel who were
previously used for political work are now deployed to carry out economic
and scientific espionage.'
Somewhat bizarrely, the BfV is still helping round up former East German
spies. 'According to information from defectors, there were 5,000 to 7,000
agents of the MfS (the East German state security ministry) in West Germany,
of whom about 10 per cent were in sensitive positions. In some cases, they
have since been taken over by the SWR. We are pursuing more than 2,200
leads.'
Trials will continue, he says, for two or three years. There will be no
amnesty until all details of the former East German spy network have been
revealed. 'If in the (Bonn) foreign ministry or defence ministry there are
still informants of the MfS, the former KGB can put these people under
pressure to work for them.'
Tracking down former East German agents is probably the least arduous of the
BfV's post-cold war challenges. Intelligence techniques are of limited use
in combating shaven-headed neo-Nazi groups. A second problem is that when
the BfV makes a bid to extend activities into new fields - for instance,
cross-border crime - the public becomes uneasy that state surveillance is
going too far. A third difficulty, Mr Werthebach admits, is that right-wing
parties under BfV surveillance, such as the Republicans, can sometimes
increase public support by claiming the state is adopting Nazi methods
against them.
He says Germans voting for the far right are mostly 'protest voters' rather
than neo-Nazis. But he adds: 'German history makes us look at right-wing
extremism more critically than our western partners.' Is Germany more
vulnerable than other countries to extremism? Mr Werthebach emits a
mellifluous chuckle. 'The British have a certain calm which the Germans
lack. The Germans thus react more hectically to social changes, raising the
impression that they have a leaning towards right-wing extremism.'
He mentions unemployment and reunification-induced economic problems. 'The
German experience is that right- and left-wing extremism fades when the
economic situation is good. I assume that we will recover economic stability
 -and extremism will lose its importance.'
In the meantime, an institution many thought would fade with the end of the
cold war has a chilling new importance. 'People say we have never needed the
Verfassungsschutz as much as today.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Benefits of being open: Two of a kind / How secret service
chiefs are coping with the post-cold war world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the thick spectacles of Mr Arthur Docters van Leeuwen, the head of
the Dutch internal security service, there glints professional sharpness,
and just a hint of well-educated menace. He describes a 'friendly talk' he
held with a well-known KGB defector. 'You might,' he confides, 'like to call
it an interrogation.'
In the solid brown headquarters of the Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst (BVD)
in The Hague, Mr Docters explains how his employees need aptitude both for
unearthing information, and for turning it to profitable use.
These are attributes wholeheartedly embraced by Britain's MI5, on which the
BVD was modelled when it was set up in 1949. However, BVD employees are also
required to espouse a most un-MI5-like characteristic: attachment to
openness.
Mr Docters, a portly and philosophical 48-year-old career civil servant,
passionately believes his service must be transparent and accountable. 'If
you want to sustain the democratic process, you have to be part of it. If
you don't properly meet this requirement, you cease to exist.
'I abhor the idea of having an elite which is in the know about the dark
side of society, which is entirely separate from ordinary people who know
nothing about it.'
The BVD maintains secrecy over individual operations - ranging from
countering organised crime, terrorism and espionage, to surveillance of
foreign nationals. It needs to be both clandestine and accountable. This is
a difficult balance but a manageable one, says Mr Docters, who has been BVD
chief since 1989. 'We have a lot of room for manoeuvre. Dutch society is
very open. We are easy people to deal with. But underneath we are quite
security-minded.'
Openness can enhance effectiveness. 'The truth is a flimsy thing - you
cannot coerce people into giving it. If you pay them, they will tell you
only part of it. People must want to tell you. So you must invest in
building up this public spirit.'
He describes how a manager from a Dutch company came forward with
information over the Iraqi super-gun. 'We were the first western
intelligence service to produce pictures of how this equipment was
engineered.'
Benefits can come in other ways, too. 'Our people may go out in the evening
and ask an elderly couple if they can use their bedroom for surveillance. If
citizens do not know what the security service is doing, then you cannot
expect co-operation from the public,' says Mr Docters.
The BVD has about 600 employees and an annual budget of Fl 65m (Pounds 23m).
It issues an annual report (although not as fact-crammed as that of
Germany's BfV security service), and is responsible to a parliamentary
control committee.
The BVD's priorities have been 'dramatically' changed by the end of the cold
war, Mr Docters says. Its range of activities has increased - and, in fields
like terrorism, the need for international co-operation has never been
greater.
'There is a lot of movement of terrorist groups across Europe - and the
Netherlands has good facilities for moving in and out. If there is a place
in the world with revolutionary activity, you will find traces of it in
Holland.'
The BVD maintains links with 40 other security services, especially those of
its EC neighbours. Like the BfV's Mr Eckart Werthebach, Mr Docters knows Mrs
Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5, well. 'This (international)
co-operation is essential. Only about 5 per cent of our problems come solely
from inside the Netherlands - the rest has some international connection.'
The BVD maintains its counter-espionage role - geared nowadays to combating
Russian desire for intelligence in the economic and technological fields.
'We still don't trust the Russians because they state time and again that
they are continuing to gather intelligence.'
Another preoccupation is organised crime, for which the BVD was given
responsibility three years ago. He backs the bid by Germany's BfV to be
granted powers in this area - a move which would give the Netherlands a
clear German counterpart for joint action.
'It would be wise for every country to give their security services a
mandate on this front. Organised crime can be beaten, but this needs
international co-operation.'
He admits that, in this field, the BVD is short of information. 'We know
something about the cartels involved - South American, Turkish,
Mediterranean. We have some facts - involving Italy, for instance. We do not
have a good map. But we can acquire one.'
Mr Docters outlines one specific reason why intelligence services need to be
involved in organised crime. 'There are people who are prepared to talk to
the security services, knowing that the case will not come before a judge
and their identity will never come out in the open. This sort of procedure
has already proved its worth in counter-espionage and anti-terrorism.'
The BVD's operations against organised crime demonstrate how it descends
into areas outside the juridical environment.
'Our countries (the west) live by the rule of law. But we create organs
which are, at least, on the border of the law. The fierce reactions you
sometimes have in public life stem from this paradox. People don't like
paradoxes.'
Mr Docters believes the Netherlands has found a way out of the paradox: his
service can operate effectively only because there is a national consensus
that it should do just that.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: Significance of National Trust backing for organic
farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK HOLDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The launch by the National Trust of its organic farming development
fund is of very great significance to the future of organic food production
in the UK ('National Trust moves to promote organic farming', July 22).
Interest in organic farming methods, as characterised by the avoidance of
artificial fertilisers and chemical pesticides and the development of
diverse, ecologically sustainable systems, has never been greater.
Yet it would appear that many of the organisations in the grant-making trust
sector have yet to acknowledge the wider social and environmental benefits
that are associated with organic farming.
As an example of this, not a single charity listed in the usual directories
of grant-making trusts includes the support of organic farming among its
objectives.
This unfortunate situation no doubt arises from the fact that most existing
charities were established long before the poisoning of our land and
drinking water by intensive farming methods had become a matter of national
public concern.
We would therefore like to appeal to the controllers and trustees of these
many charities to consider amending their list of objectives to include
organic farming and to give it a high priority in their rankings for
financial support.
Not only are organic farmers and growers producing a food commodity that is
in demand in the marketplace, but they are actively pursuing practical and
principled solutions to the continuing denuding of the countryside by
conventional agriculture, the welfare of farm animals and the very fabric of
our rural communities.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: Focus on the finer things - Paris Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week I made some disparaging remarks about the currently dishevelled
condition of the Palais du Louvre in Paris. Now is the moment to make
partial amends by recommending two rewarding exhibitions in the Louvre's
Pavilion de Flore (enter on the Tuileries side by the Porte Jaujard).
You need to move quickly to catch Antonello da Messina's 'Christ at the
Column' which closes on August 9. It will be worth it to see a model of the
kind of small, highly-focused exhibition on which museums should
increasingly be concentrating their resources.
Last year, the Louvre bought 'Christ at the Column' by Antonello, the
15th-century Sicilian master, for FFr42m (Pounds 4.78m). It is a small,
grimly intense painting of the head and shoulders of the weeping Christ, a
noose round his neck. There are only about 40 known paintings by Antonello.
The exhibition traces his contribution to the evolution of the 'Man of
Sorrows' type of single-figure devotional image required by patrons for
private worship. As evidence of Antonello's influence we also see Mantegna's
sublime 'Ecce Homo', borrowed from the Musee Jacquemart Andre.
Pure, undemanding enjoyment is provided by the Louvre's principal show this
summer, French Master Drawings from the Pierpont Morgan Library (until
August 30). The sponsor, JP Morgan &amp; Co., has brought 125 drawings to Paris
to mark 125 years of the House of Morgan's involvement in French financial
life. The Morgan Bank's finest hour in France was 1870 after the country was
on her knees after suffering defeat in the Franco-Prussian war. Alone among
the London banks, Morgan &amp; Co. was prepared to help with a Pounds 10m loan.
Pigeons took documents to and from the blockaded city and one particularly
heavy batch went in by hot air balloon. J. Pierpont Morgan, legendarily
avaricious collector and founder of the Library in New York, adored France
and all things French. In the 1900s he started to amass drawings; more have
since been added to make this one of the finest collections in the US.
Lovely things abound in the exhibition, not least the earliest exhibit, a
remarkable little sketchbook made in about 1400 from wafer-thin sheets of
boxwood. Poussin, Greuze, Claude, and six Watteau drawings of delightful
spontaneity are just a few of the particular pleasures of a selection which
ends with Gauguin and Redon. (The show runs until until August 30 then moves
to the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, September 5 - January 2.)
If you are interested in 19th-century Orientalism I recommend Album de
Voyage at the Musee Hebert. This is the obscure but atmospheric
studio-residence of Ernest Hebert, a grandee of the art scene in late
19th-century France. The exhibition is on until September 27; the museum is
at 85, rue de Cherch-Midi (open from 12.30 on weekdays, closed Tuesdays).
In 1868, six French painters, a photographer and one Dutchman set out on a
five-month journey through the Levant. Two decades after Delacroix's
delirious reaction to the colour, grace and nobility of native life in
Morocco, Orientalist painting was at its peak. Professional artists
descended on the Levant, hungry to sketch, take photographs and buy studio
props.
Sketches, paintings and photographs of the trip have been brought together
from collections in France and the Netherlands. Most of the work which
survives is by Gerome, leader of the trip, and Leon Bonnat. Both were to
become enormously successful academic painters. Whatever one feels about
their full-scale productions, their small oil sketches of landscapes in
Egypt and Palestine are most attractive.
The same cannot be said for the tedious, careful studies of bedouin by the
Dutchman, Willem de Famars Testas. He, too, did well out of the experience
and became the first and premier Orientalist of the Netherlands. His journal
for 1868 was recently discovered and is published (in French) in the
catalogue (FFr280). It appears that the Middle East traveller was not
obliged to rough it. A birthday feast on Mount Sinai cooked by the dragoman
consisted of more than 20 dishes including conserved dishes of artichokes,
turkey, fillet of beef, truffled partridges, chicken, woodcock, and four
different puddings.
Bonapartists will want to revisit the lovely Musee de Malmaison (take the
RER to Grande Arche) where Queen Hortense: An Artistic Woman describes the
joys and sorrows of that lady. Daughter of Empress Josephine and Queen of
Holland, Hortense possessed an above average aptitude for the arts, from
writing novels to musical composition. (Show ends September 27; closed
Tuesday and 12-1.30 daily.)
One final suggestion for your Parisian wanderings; from August 1, the 'Lady
and the Unicorn' tapestries, one of the most famous works of art of the
entire middle ages, will go back on display in a new, halogen-lit
installation at the former Musee Cluny, which now goes by the altogether
less evocative title of Musee du Moyen Age.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: A Yankee makes merry in England - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have written before that one of the great joys of the English summer -
even better this year than cricket - is the Open Theatre in full swing at
London's Regent's Park. So it is with the Rodgers and Hart musical A
Connecticut Yankee. If you don't know Mark Twain's delightful story about
the east coast American at the court of King Arthur, read it on holiday. It
is much more fun than Huckleberry Finn. But it will do no harm to see the
musical first.
A Connecticut Yankee could have been written for outdoor production,
especially as night falls and there is a total eclipse of the sun which
saves the Yankee from almost certain execution by immolation. Actually, this
scene should be even better as the summer wears on. At the end of July in
London, it is not quite dark enough for the full effect.
The musical is not as subtle as the book. Corny would be a more accurate
description, but the corn is of a high order. When Sir Lancelot's old armour
is wheeled on stage, it is described as Esquire Magazine's idea of what the
well-dressed man was wearing in the year 543.
Quite the best sequence comes with the entry of Anna Nicholas as Morgan Le
Fay. Ms Nicholas has played the rejected bride-to-be when we were still in
the US Navy in the 20th century at the start of the show. Now she is
magnificent, dressed in scarlet and black carrying a riding crop and
occasionally showing a leg. She sings a song called 'To Keep My Love Alive'
which has the audience straining to catch every clever word. Never the
bridesmaid, always the bride, Morgan Le Fay explains that the reason she has
not been unfaithful to her husbands and lovers is that she bumped them off
before the need arose. When ill-at-ease, she kills at ease.
The trick of the song is that it combines romantic music with a cerebral
lyric. Stephen Sondheim plainly learnt a lot from it. There are other
treasures. I liked the rhymes: venison and Tennyson, sweethearts and
indiscreet hearts, damn a lot and Camelot, even, stretching it a bit,
possibilities and ill-at-ease. Unusually for Regent's Park, the show compels
attention from the beginning. Not even the external distractions can compete
with the boisterousness of the US Navy. Once the Navy has established a
beachhold, it is natural to slip into the more sentimental mood of 'My Heart
Stood Still'.
Later on, the customary distractions are put to good use. There is a
helicopter in the script though not, as in Miss Saigon, shown on stage. In
Regent's Park it is a customary sound. The aerial feat comes in two
miniature light aircraft flying down a wire across the top of the arena. The
audience, glancing at the sky for the real thing, applauds - and rightly -
this bit of the design by Paul Farnsworth, like Ariel putting a girdle round
the earth.
Other parts of the design are a trifle creaky. One would not be entirely
surprised if the towers in this Camelot fell down, but it would be in
keeping with such a zany show if they did and you can be confident that the
cast would rise to it, just as they dealt with Ms Nicholas when she lost her
shoe early on. There is a wonderful wizard in Christopher Biggins as Merlin.
Ian Talbot, the presiding spirit over the Regent's Park venture, directs.
The theatre on the first night was full to the tree-tops, as it deserves to
be for the rest of the summer.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: A gift for Dame Ninette - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham Royal Ballet has marked the 95th birthday of Dame Ninette de
Valois with a long-overdue revival of Job. She made this 'masque for
dancing' in 1931 - Vaughan Williams insisted that his score was not for 'a
ballet' - and in it we see, still powerful, the pre-eminent qualities of her
choreography. De Valois' wide experience of the theatre had, by 1931, taught
her the value of clarity and simplicity in movement. In realising a theme
inspired by William Blake, she saw how sculptural images, so strong in his
drawings, might be realised in the then fashionable form of dance plastique.
There resulted choreography as forceful and dramatically vivid as its score
and a work which long held a special place in the Sadler's Wells repertory.
Ballet-goers of my generation grew up with Job, and with an understanding of
the dignity of Dame Ninette's dances. After 20 years without performance,
this revival - exemplary in style and feeling, thanks to the eagle eyes of
Michael Somes, Joy Newton and Jean Bedells who have staged it - reasserts
the continuing vitality of de Valois' creations. (It is time Rake's Progress
was brought back to the stage, and I think that BRB's public would rejoice
in her wonderfully funny and imaginative Prospect Before Us.) As always,
score and design are essential companions in de Valois' theatre. The Vaughan
Williams score is thrilling; the John Piper designs, which were commissioned
for the post-war Covent Garden revival, are magnificent on their own terms,
and echo Blake - and Samuel Palmer - to beautiful effect. Job is, in sum, a
grand achievement; it is a salutary reminder of how our national ballet once
involved major British artists in creations of enduring significance.
The Birmingham cast on Wednesday night was fine. Satan's is the central
role, and Michael O'Hare gives him menacing physical weight. Dolin, the
part's creator, was nobly evil; Helpmann, who dominated the role for years,
was malevolently beautiful. O'Hare is a worthy successor to these.
Surrounding him, we see the serene dances of the angelic host and the
brilliantly imagined activities of Job's comforters, the Pestilences and
Messengers. (How well de Valois used hands, to point and threaten and mock.
With what acute sensibility did she pare away everything except essential
gesture and movement. The least action is significant). I admire Alain
Dubreuil as Job - ideally simple and dignified - and I salute the entire
cast. At curtain fall we cheered Dame Ninette in her grand-tier box, for we
owe her everything, and not least her ballets.
BRB's triple bill also brought the first London showing of the company's
revival of Massine's Choreartium. Eighteen months ago I reported on this
brilliant rescue from Birmingham, where it has been splendidly supervised by
Tatiana Leskova of the de Basil Ballets Russes. Choreartium was the second
of the symphonic ballets with which Massine (and de Basil's company) stormed
into the public's heart in 1933. The score is Brahms' fourth symphony, and
Massine clothed it with movement that explored its formal procedures, and
imbued them with strong if undefined emotion. Surging blocks of activity; a
line of women grieving through the second movement; a pastoral interlude; a
final outburst of heroics: these are the obvious matters of the piece.
More intriguing is Massine's highly subjective - and, be it said,
theatrically convincing - response to Brahmsian melody and texture. Because
Massine throws himself into the creative process - and drags his cast
gloriously in his wake, racing along on the crest of the choreography's
feelings - we surrender to the work. It is wild, intensely Russian and,
ultimately, exhilarating. To tastes formed by Balanchine's response to
music, it is also completely over the top. But its drive and passionate
self-confidence (it could be superbly danced by the Bolshoi Ballet) win us.
Wednesday's performance was devoted, if a little ragged - the piece needs to
be run in during several showings - and BRB's artists deserve much
commendation. The new designs by Nadine Baylis, as I have earlier reported,
are beautiful, apt. Most important, Mme Leskova's revival is true, and
honours Massine's significance to the ballet of our century. My companion
was a member of the original cast: she approved whole-heartedly of the
staging.
This imaginative triple bill (which is being given only three showings)
opened with MacMillan's Concerto. It looked clean and clear in production,
but it, too, needs a run of performance to polish its rough edges and some
uncertain dancing from its soloists. Excellent accounts of three major
scores came from the Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Paul Murphy.
                         *       *       *
English National Ballet, meantime, has taken up summer residence on the
South Bank in London. This week, Swan Lake is on offer. (How, I wonder,
could things be otherwise). The staging is Raissa Struchkova's recension of
the one-time Bolshoi Ballet version, sound and happily traditional. It looks
rather boxed in on the Festival Hall's shelf, and it needs stronger central
performances than those I saw on Wednesday afternoon from Trinidad Vives and
Tamas Solymosi. My greatest pleasure came from the dancing of a corps de
ballet swan, who closely resembles the very young Lynn Seymour, moving and
posing with the same melting grace.
The Birmingham Royal Ballet is at Covent Garden with varied programmes until
August 7. English National Ballet is at the Royal Festival Hall with varied
programmes until August 7.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: Mixed feelings for Wagner as showbiz - Bayreuth
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first three offerings of this year's Bayreuth Festival comprise, among
other things, a brisk and varied tour of current Wagner production styles.
The new Tristan und Isolde (which I described on this page earlier in the
week) is staged as a response - in most ways a coolly questioning,
distancing, even disaffected one - to text quite as much as music by a
modern German theatre intellectual, the noted playwright Heiner Muller.
Tannhauser followed, in a revival of Wolfgang Wagner's own briskly efficient
but essentially ugly and insubstantial show, a dim, ossified late-1980s
reminiscence of the work he and (far more importantly) his brother Wieland
were doing here two and three decades earlier.
And then the revival of Der fliegende Hollander, produced by Dieter Dorn.
This purveys the brand of zany 1990s theatrical legerdemain that we have
learned (tentatively) to call postmodern: all flat planes, bright
colour-contrasts, sleight-of-hand breaches of conventional proscenium-arch
decorum, mobile parts sailing insouciantly around the stage space, and in
general an air of 'naive', film-influenced theatricality that creates new
modes of Wagner spectacle, entertainment and story-telling.
I was put in mind by this Fliegender Hollander of the (sadly aborted) recent
Scottish Opera Ring, produced by Richard Jones. The difference - British
readers and opera-goers will hardly need telling - is that that was achieved
on pence and ha'pence, whereas for Dorn's and designer Jurgen Rose's moving
machines, and their Wizard of Oz-style rotation tricks during the
Senta-Dutchman duet, mega-Deutschemark expenditure must have been the order
of the day.
The results are certainly enjoyable, breathtaking even - this is by a long
way the most showbiz Wagner I have seen in the august Wagner temple (Peter
Hall's elaborately aerial 1983 Ride of the Valkyries not excepted). Unlike
the best of Richard Jones's Ring scenic inventions, however, the effects
seemed devised only to dazzle. Little light was shed on the characters, who
were brought on in countless striking ways (and costumes) but not
meaningfully confronted. In Tannhauser Wolfgang at least concentrated his
cast on expressive reaction and ensemble relationship; for all their period
dress these Hollander figures belong to a world of sci-fi, comic-strip or
cartoon video.
Encountering in quick succession three such Bayreuth performances, in a
theatre designed to aid the spectator in focusing on sounds, sights and
meanings, had the consequence of eliciting from me some pretty old-fashioned
operatic affirmations. In the end, of course, it is the most potent Wagner
conducting and singing that win real results.
After a while the whizz-bang visual pleasures of this Fliegende Hollander
began to pall, because Giuseppe Sinopoli seemed largely unable to tap the
springs of rhythmic vitality and colour in the music - he kept the surface
active, left the interior unexplored. (Pit and stage were often out of
kilter.) And Bernd Weikl (title role) and Sabine Hass (a blowzy-toned Senta
with powerful, sometimes hideously ugly notes at the top of the staff)
emitted the text in bits and pieces, bumps and thumps - not lines and
phrases.
Tannhauser, by contrast, had a conductor - Donald Runnicles - who knew how
to keep all the opera's parts in flowing, smoothly interlocked, dramatically
acute action, even the opera's inherently cumbersome, creaky, long-winded
parts. The singing was acceptable rather than distinguished, apart from a
wonderfully rounded, full-grained Landgrave from the veteran bass Hans Sotin
(his Daland was also by miles the best thing about the Hollander), but at
least it was always directed toward tapping the expressive potential of the
musical phrases.
Here are a couple more old-fashioned affirmations. The choral singing,
trained by Norbert Balatsch, was in both early Wagner operas of incomparably
fine quality: robust, resonant, single-minded in delivery. Precisely
purposeful, thorough-going preparation characterised it - and, indeed,
characterised all three opening shows.
The festival ethic remains very much alive and well in Bayreuth: for this
reason, and in spite of all the mixed feelings the place and its raison
d'etre inspire, a visit here is always a special experience.
Festival continues until August 28.

BBC2 begins a series, Architecture Of The Imagination (9.30) which promises
to 'explore the deeper meaning of everyday architectural surroundings',
starting with the door. Other programmes will deal with the stairway, the
window, the bridge and the tower, which, we are told, will be analysed via
film clips, contemporary images and psychological revelations. For years
Friday was the night to stay in and watch movies. Often there was an
embarrassment of choice, with several good offers overlapping. And now? BBC1
screens a 1988 flop called She's Having A Baby (10.20) described by the
leading American movie guide as a comedy drama which 'grows monotonous after
a while'. BBC2 offers Fritz Lang's 1948 pot boiler The Secret Beyond The
Door about an heiress who marries a millionaire and suspects she may become
his victim. James Agee said: 'It's a hopeless job and a worthless movie'
(11.20). Channel 4 goes even further back to dig out a Boris Karloff horror
movie from 1936: The Walking Dead(12.05). Sounds like a night when you pays
your money and goes out to dinner.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Management: A revised flight plan - BA's new plant, opening
today, has a Japanese feel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a bleak airport overlooking the Bristol Channel, British Airways is
launching an adventurous attempt to transfer Japanese ideas on the
management of manufacturing to a maintenance operation.
The airline has built a Pounds 70m maintenance hangar on a greenfield site
at Cardiff airport in south Wales.
Officially opened today, British Airways Maintenance Cardiff (BMAC) is
devoted to looking after Boeing 747 aircraft, BA's most important model
which flies on money-spinning, long-haul routes.
The project was earmarked from the start as a testbed for management ideas
that might be extended to other parts of the company.
'We set out quite deliberately to emulate other greenfield sites: to go back
to basics and structure the working relations and the shop floor ideally,'
says Alistair Cumming, chairman of BMAC, BA's director of engineering and a
member of its executive board of management.
South Wales seemed suitable because the local population is familiar with
the Japanese management style in local factories owned by Sony, Hitachi and
Panasonic.
The results of the strategy are a striking piece of architecture in which
offices and hangar are naturally lit, and a long list of management ideas
under test. The schemes new to BA include:
Breaking down demarcations between mechanics, engineers and avionics experts
as far as skills permit. The idea is encourage staff to be able to do each
other's jobs as much as possible. Training programmes are designed to break
down barriers further.
Ensuring that all staff, from receptionists to managing director, spend at
least one day in every quarter on the hangar floor working on aircraft.
Creating a single union agreement with the AEEU, the general engineering
union, outside BA's existing multi-union arrangements; the wage bill is more
than 20 per cent lower than it would have been at London's Heathrow airport
for similarly qualified staff.
Subcontracting all non-core work such as security, catering, plant
maintenance and cleaning.
Describing staff as 'company members' not 'employees'.
Insisting that all staff, including executives, clock in and wear identical
white boiler suits.
Equipping all grades of office with identical furniture.
Building a single canteen for all staff and eliminating reserved car parking
spaces.
The company has also tried to instil a culture of cleanliness: office
cleaners work during the day rather than when staff have gone home. All
tools are 'shadowboarded', that is, a cardboard cutout is uncovered when a
tool is taken from its storage box. This reduces the risk that a tool might
be stolen or left inside an aircraft.
BMAC was careful in who it chose to work at the plant. It was wary of
mechanics accustomed to sloppy work in local car repair garages and wanted
people who already had a flexible approach to their work, says Alan
McDonald, general manager. Half the 340 staff recruited so far have never
worked on aircraft and only 31 came from elsewhere in BA.
Staff numbers will eventually rise to about 1,000, to cope with BA's new
747s which otherwise would have been maintained by subcontractors, probably
in East Asia.
The test of whether BMAC can compete with these rivals will come when the
third and final 747 maintenance bay opens in a year's time. BA does not need
the extra space and BMAC will try to sell its services to other airlines.
But by then the low-cost base strategy will have advanced another notch.
Today, only one in five employees is in support and administration. Next
year it will be one in six.

The rise of Stephen Grabiner at The Telegraph, publishers of the Daily and
Sunday Telegraph continues.
He has been appointed deputy managing director responsible for the
day-to-day management of the company's operations. Grabiner, 34, will report
directly to the managing director, Joe Cooke, who will continue to have
overall responsibility for the business.
The new deputy managing director came to the Telegraph in the early days of
Conrad Black's ownership and stayed on to become marketing director in
October 1986. In April he became acting managing director while Joe Cooke
was ill and joined the board at that time.
Two new directors have also been appointed. They are Len Sanderson, the
39-year-old Telegraph advertising director and Stephen Jarislowsky, chairman
and chief executive of Jarislowsky Fraser, a Canadian pension fund
management company. He serves as The Telegraph's representative on the board
of Southam, in which The Telegraph recently bought a large stake.

FT  30 JUL 93 / People: Bancroft Clark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the shoe fits, wear it, would be a suitable epitaph for Bancroft Clark,
the man behind the expansion since the Second World War of shoe
manufacturer, C&amp;J Clark. Chairman from 1942-1967, Bancroft Clark died at the
age of 91 and was buried yesterday in Street, Somerset, where his
great-grandfather first started making sheepskin slippers.
It was Bancroft who had the foresight to develop the piece of foot folklore
familiar to millions - the Clarks foot-gauge - just in time for the baby
boom. 'On this idea the vast expansion in our children's business was
founded,' he once proudly claimed. Associates attribute Clark's firmer
footing in the latter half of the century, when UK shoe manufacturers were
assailed by cheaper imports, to Bancroft's foresight.
A stern disciplinarian, Bancroft is believed to have been intensely
irritated by the row among Clark's shareholders which threatened to throw
the family-owned company into the arms of conglomerate Berisford
International. However, age and illness prevented 'Mr Bancroft', as he was
known to employees and village residents, from taking an active role in
resolving the dispute.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Management: 'Turf warfare' among the tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the prime competitive advantages of multinational companies over
regional or local rivals is supposed to be the ability to transfer knowledge
and experience between their operations across the globe. Yet far too many
of them are singularly inept at this 'worldwide learning', as business
school academics call it.
Take General Motors and Ford.
In the 1980s GM's European operations were transformed under Opel's
leadership from laggard into thriving powerhouse. Yet back home in Detroit
things went from bad to worse, and then awful. The parent company was
stubbornly resistant to any form of change, but especially to the notion
that it had anything to learn from an upstart offshoot several thousand
miles away.
Only when GM had slumped almost to its knees a couple of years ago was Jack
Smith, an American who had run the European operation some years before,
finally able to start importing some lessons from there.
His most dramatic European import, a few months before he became chief
executive last autumn, was Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who had slashed
Opel's costs and boosted its quality by revolutionising relations with its
suppliers.
What followed is fast becoming the stuff of legend - or nightmare, depending
on your point of view. Lopez stayed less than a year, and then decamped for
Volkswagen.
GM's ire at this, which waxed still further this week as extreme allegations
flew between it and VW, is not just over his alleged stealing of its secret
plans. It is also because, in a more general sense, he embodies much of the
Opel learning that the parent company still needs so badly.
By contrast, one might expect Ford's internal difficulties with
transatlantic learning to seem anodyne. But they have had their own share of
intrigue, and are also more instructive for other companies with similar
problems.
For one thing, the necessary flow of learning should have been far easier
than at GM, since it was in a more acceptable direction for the
newly-revitalised Ford US: from itself to its ailing European offspring. For
another, Ford tried far harder than GM to achieve the flow.
A key facet of its problem, the incessant turnover of top managers at Ford
of Europe and the consequent lack of a consistent push for change, is
revealed in vivid inside detail for the first time in a discussion paper by
Kenneth Starkey, reader in organisational analysis at the University of
Nottingham's school of management and finance.
Borrowing a phrase from many European cynics within Ford of Europe, Starkey
calls the phenomenon 'executive tourism': the constant recycling of senior
American managers, especially through the two top posts of chairman and
president, as they clambered their way up the ladder towards greater things
back home in Dearborn.
In Ford US there was considerable stability in the equivalent two jobs: the
pair most credited with its revival, Don Petersen and Harold Poling, were in
post for nine and six years respectively between 1980 and 1989, and in
tandem for five. The creative tension between them was also vital: Petersen
was the visionary champion of change, while the efficiency-minded Poling
'kept the company's feet on the floor', as Starkey puts it.
In Europe there were lots of Polings but no Petersen - apart from one
change-minded chairman whose credibility with Dearborn was damaged by the
early problems of the Ford Sierra.
Not only that, but the instability of the chairmanship and presidency gave
enormous clout to the one manager immediately beneath them who did stay in
post throughout the 1980s, Bill Hayden, the vice-president of manufacturing.
Hayden represented Ford's old obsession with cost, efficiency and control.
And he resisted 'programme management' - the vital bridging of design,
engineering, production and other specialist departments - until the late
1980s, when his change of heart gave it a very belated boost.
Starkey's account of all this is replete with remarkable quotations from
Ford managers at all levels. One of them complains that the European
executive committee travelled around 'as a cloistered group', and that 'they
never meet plant managers - they're like high-level tourists'.
Hayden groans about top managers constantly winging their way over from the
US and back again. 'When they arrived I'd usually go and introduce myself,'
he says. 'But with time - it would register that a new guy had arrived but I
didn't bother going down the corridor to knock on his door. The business
went on as before, new chairman or not.'
A further factor also put a brake on change in Ford of Europe: that for much
of the 1980s its profits kept its parent afloat. 'The pressure was to keep
producing profit, and keep doing the job that you're doing,' says one
manager.
So although various US change initiatives were exported to Europe, and
adapted for local consumption, advocacy of them was not nearly as strong.
The result is that Ford's European arm is in far worse shape today than its
parent.
At GM, where the boot is manifestly on the other foot, executives attribute
much of its European success to a similar combination of top-level stability
and championship of change as at Ford US. As Starkey argues, if top teams
want to avoid 'groupthink' they must encourage constructive dissent within
their organisations, rather than the all-too-common practice of 'turf
warfare'.
Smith and Lopez clearly thrived on that 'constructive dissent', and GM was
feeling the benefit mightily. Which is partly why the Detroit giant feels it
has lost so much by Lopez's defection, and such a bitter form of turf
warfare has erupted with VW.

FT  30 JUL 93 / People: TDG finds fourth finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Cole, chief executive of Transport Development Group, has found another
finance director to replace Paul Kilduff who left in February after only
seven months in the job. He is Stephen Bentley who moves from chemicals
distributor Ellis &amp; Everard where he had been in the finance function for
the past five and a half years.
This is Cole's fourth finance director since he arrived at TDG three years
ago. The first took early retirement and the second was promoted to look
after TDG's troubled French operations.
Bentley says he is 'aware of the changes' but that he also understands the
reasons for them. Meanwhile Cole is cagey as to how he has attempted to
avoid making another mistake: 'Both men (Kilduff and Bentley) are graduates,
accountants and have been finance directors. You make the best choice you
can at the time. Bentley comes with a good track record from a medium-sized
company. What can I say?'
The new man will not be short of a challenge when he arrives in early
autumn. TDG recently announced it was closing its long distance French
transport subsidiary at a cost of Pounds 11.7m. It is also trying to recover
Dollars 15.8m of the monies due when it sold its US operation Willig Freight
Lines to a consortium of senior management. Cole says the consortium has
been trying to raise the money through 'a complicated bond issue', and has
negotiated a new deadline for payment of September 31.
A chartered accountant by training, 40-year-old Bentley spent nine years at
Tricentrol, latterly as corporate finance and marketing executive. He moved
to Ellis &amp; Everard when the oil company was taken over by Arco.

A new month approaches and wads of computer print-outs from the personnel
department are hitting managers' desks throughout the UK.
With the spread of computerised personnel systems, which are often linked to
payroll systems, the potential for collecting, storing and disseminating
information on employees is vast. Apart from basic data on staff numbers and
how much they cost, information may also be stored on training and
productivity.
The problem is that many personnel departments appear to be churning out
reports and sending them to managers with little or no consultation. A new
study by the University of Sussex-based Institute of Manpower Studies* finds
that managers either throw away the reports, or have to wade through reams
of irrelevant material before alighting on the figures they need.
In a survey of 200 managers conducted by IMS, nearly a third of managers
were either very dissatisfied or dissatisfied with the type of information
they received from the personnel department. Best provided were data on
staff numbers and their pay and benefits; the provision of data on
productivity, absence and skill levels were all identified as needing
improvement.
A recurring theme in the report is lack of communication between those
producing and receiving information. IMS found that the personnel systems
managers it interviewed for the study were focused almost entirely on 'the
system'. Most were planning to incorporate more data and some were thinking
of a new system. Not many mentioned more communication with managers as a
future priority.

enables runners to customise their shoes by blowing up parts of the soles in
a similar way to blowing up a car tyre.
The Tubular shoes contain two chambers of air-filled rubber in the outer
sole - the part of the sole which comes in contact with the ground. By
blowing up the two chambers the runner can adjust the cushioning and
stability. The shoes, on sale next week in France, Germany, the UK and US,
come with a digital pump and guidance on the appropriate pressure. Adidas:

FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Flying high with diesel power - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trials have begun on the Isle of Wight of a diesel-powered engine for light
aircraft. The designers believe the use of diesel oil, as opposed to
aviation gasoline, will save Pounds 10,000 on a flying time of 500 hours -
the purchase cost of the engine.
Although designers have been aware of the benefits of diesel engines in the
past, use of the fuel has resulted in torsional vibration, which produces an
uneven twisting action of the crankshaft and consequent risk of propeller
failure. ABN Engines, of Ryde, have overcome this by putting the components
in a novel configuration which gives the Ashton engine an inherent balance
and reduces the loads reaching the crankshaft. ABN Engines: 0983 403468.

Working from home has meant a surge over the past year in the use of
domestic facsimile machines in the US, according to the latest report from
BIS Strategic Decisions.
Of those people questioned who operated a business from home, 47 per cent
had bought their fax machine in the past year. Of the respondents who took
work home from the office, 89 per cent said their machines had been
purchased in the last 12 months.
The report, User Requirements for Home Facsimile Product, concludes that
need, rather than falling prices, has proven the driving force behind the
purchases. BIS Strategic Decisions: US, 617 982 9500.

Most computer security devices prevent unauthorised access, copying of discs
or the spread of viruses. Swift-Tech, of Huntingdon, has produced a device
which does all three.
The Sysecure, which is compatible with almost all PCs, is a mechanical lock
which attaches to the floppy disc drive and controls the power supply to
them. By tapping a pin number into the keypad the PC can be used. Two
security levels mean some users can access data from the floppy disc, while
others can only use data held on the computer's memory, preventing
virus-ridden discs being introduced and software being illegally copied.

An innovative form of car wiring harness, claimed to be 30 per cent lighter
than conventional wiring, is to be incorporated in a small car to be
launched by Nissan next year, writes John Griffiths.
Called 'flexible flat circuit', and developed in partnership with
Mitsubishi's cables subsidiary, it is stamped out of flat conductive
material and covered with insulation to form a sandwich-like board - in
essence, an adaption of printed circuit technology. The circuitry is cheaper
to produce and install than conventional wiring looms, which are assembled
from single wiring strands that often have to be pre-heated to be bent
around the car's operating mechanisms. Nissan: Japan, 03 5565 2148.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Heavenly inspiration - The US Star Wars
initiative has led to a wide range of discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When former US President Ronald Reagan revealed the Strategic Defence
Initiative to an awe-struck television audience 10 years ago, he captured
the imagination of the world.
To many, the concept of a defence system which would intercept nuclear
missiles in space seemed the perfect palliative to a world fearful of
nuclear war. To others, it seemed an impossible dream, and the programme's
nickname, 'Star Wars', captured the scepticism and hope the project
inspired.
If the Star Wars initiative is not yet dead, it is certainly on its last
legs. Earlier this year, SDI was forced to change its official name to the
Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation (BMDO), and told to shift its
priorities from space-oriented research to ground, or 'theatre', missile
defence.
The proposed 1994 budget has allocated no resources to space-based
interceptors, the heart of the Star Wars programme, and a pending
Congressional bill looks set to cut funding for the office's other projects
further. Almost Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) was poured into SDI over the last
decade, and now that the project is facing demise, it is natural to question
whether any good came out of the massive initiative.
Although the goal of catching nuclear missiles in space remains little more
than a dream, a dazzling array of new technologies has been developed by
Star Wars researchers.
From the beginning, the SDI office boasted an aggressive scheme to transfer
technology to the private sector and many companies are making use of these
new tools.
The wide range of technologies available attests to the ambitious nature of
the SDI initiative. Discoveries range from medical advances to computer
software and new materials. Products on the market today include synthetic
diamonds for use in industrial cutting, laser shows for Disney World, and
three-dimensional computer software for architects.
The BMDO office maintains a database with descriptions of 2,000 new
technologies spawned by SDI. The number of technologies listed is far more
impressive than the sales they generate, though.
According to the BMDO, hundreds of companies are now relying on Star Wars
discoveries, but most of those groups are small, with annual sales of
Dollars 10m or less. Many companies are still in the research and
development phase, without any products yet on the market. Still, those
involved with the SDI spin-offs say annual sales are a poor measure of the
new technologies' success.
'A lot of these companies will see their sales mushroom over the next few
years,' says Aram Mooradian, chairman of Microcor, which helped develop
laser systems for SDI. 'Also, a lot of this is what you call 'enabling'
technology - technology that can enable the development of a multi-billion
dollar industry. Microcor's sales may not be that large, but we're working
on laser components for a Dollars 4bn sector.' Microcor is currently
developing a miniaturised laser product which would add clarity to the
images produced by projection television - television which is projected on
to a big screen. Laser and computer software were two of the most prolific
sectors of SDI research, and both have proved especially applicable to the
medical field.
'We came up with a computer programme designed to track ballistic missiles
after they took off,' said Kendall Preston, president of Kensal Corporation,
which worked on Star Wars research.
'We had to deal in detail with a three-dimensional world. When we started
looking around for alternative markets, the medical field was the first
thing that came to mind.' Kensal Corporation now produces three-dimensional
pictures of human tissues to help physicians develop treatments for their
patients.
Another company making a successful shift to the medical market is AccSys
Corporation. The founders of the company were originally asked to develop an
accelerator for neutral particle beams, which would be used to distinguish
decoys from actual nuclear missiles. Today, the group uses the technology in
proton therapy for cancer patients. With the new accelerator, a beam
projects high-energy protons into a patient.
'The protons go through matter with no damage,' said Robert Hamm, president
of the group. 'But then they are deposited in the tissue where the tumour is
located. There, their energy explodes and kills off the targeted cancer
cells.'
The transfer of technology from SDI to the private sector has been a
herculean task for the defence department. The SDI group has spent years
matchmaking between the developers of technology and their markets.
SDI targeted small companies rather than large corporations, under an
initiative called the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme,
which continues to provide a small amount of funding.
'We had a limited amount of money and decided it would make a bigger impact
on smaller companies, which are more research and development oriented,'
said Nicholas Montanarelli, who heads the SBIR programme.
Since its inception, the programme organised several conferences a year to
allow its suppliers to meet potential customers. The conferences were
attended by representatives from a number of different industries, and
developers of technology for SDI were periodically invited to deliver
half-hour presentations on their research.
The job of the representatives was to discover how some of these
technologies could be used in industry.
All intellectual property rights for the new technologies also belonged to
the companies developing the new products. Many of the companies that are
now marketing SDI technology were started by individuals once working for
the federal government.
'The key to a good technology transfer programme is having certain people
who want to go with the technology and start up a company on their own,'
says Peter Clout, a former employee of the national Los Alamos Laboratory
and today president of Vista Control Systems, a company selling software
developed with SDI funds.
'You can't just wrap the technology up in a parcel and put it in the mail.'
The worth of the Star Wars initiative will probably be debated for years to
come. While Dollars 30bn may have been a high price to pay, there can be no
doubt that a number of useful technologies has emerged from the project.
Whether or not these will translate into the billion-dollar industries many
of their developers are hoping is still uncertain.

FT  30 JUL 93 / The Property Market: A move to the country - Lloyd's
Register's controversial plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's Register, the ship classification society, shares little more than
its name with Lloyd's of London, the insurance market. But it plans to
follow the example of its namesake by constructing a new office building
designed by the architect Richard Rogers.
The plans are once again controversial. This time, however, the controversy
is not about the design of the building, but rather about the company's
decision to move from London to Liphook in Hampshire. Assuming the building
wins planning permission, it expects to move by 1996.
There is little doubt that the society needs to leave its existing offices,
which are over-crowded, dilapidated and expensive to maintain. 'We have
slum-like conditions,' says Mr Patrick O'Ferrall, the society's chairman.
But critics are not convinced that the move out of London is justified. It
will uproot 60-80 per cent of Lloyd's 1,350 staff and will loosen the
society's 233-year-old ties with one of the world's leading centres of
maritime business in favour of one with no shipping tradition.
'The move is sad for Lloyd's Register, sad for the City of London and sad
for shipping,' lamented a recent editorial in Lloyd's List, the newspaper.
'. . . It cannot be good for London's future as a world shipping centre that
the leading classification society is set to add to the diaspora.'
But Mr O'Ferrall defends the plans for the move, which he set in motion when
he joined the society as deputy chairman in early 1991. The relocation is
'good for our customers, good for our staff and thus good for Lloyd's
Register and the wider community', he says.
Certainly the reason cannot be financial. The collapse of rental values in
the City and the expected cut in London rate bills after 1995 have made the
capital less expensive.
The 376,000 sq ft building is budgeted to cost about Pounds 34m, but the
cost of relocating the staff will be far greater. The society may have
difficulties in assigning the lease on its Croydon office building, which is
currently occupied by its industrial and engineering services division.
It has planning permission for a 275,000 sq ft office building on its
Fenchurch Street site. But what its value will be by 1996 is highly
uncertain.
Although there is no clear financial case for the move, Lloyd's believes it
is justified by the need to improve its staff's 'quality of life'.
'Getting in and out of London is a painful experience,' says the chairman,
who commutes in from Godalming, Surrey, himself. He thinks that productivity
will improve if staff have an easier journey and more pleasant surroundings.
They are also more likely to stay late if they have an easy journey home, he
believes. 'If people's journeys (are) easy you don't get a stampede at 5.30.
It will be an added benefit,' he says.
He hopes the society will also benefit from bringing its workforce together
under one roof.
The site in Hampshire was chosen after an exhaustive search of the
south-west for places with easy access to London and airports.
Lloyd's feels confident that its workforce supports the idea because of the
findings of a questionnaire it commissioned in the early stages of its
plans.
However, companies that move to the country often find their employees miss
the bustle of towns. Debenham Tewson Research, a property adviser, published
research showing that many tenants that moved out of town missed the
shopping, leisure facilities and access to public transport to be found in
cities. Lloyd's is considering installing shopping facilities and a bus
service to and from the nearest station.
An extra problem for its employees may be the disruption suffered by their
spouses, two-thirds of whom are in employment. That said, those who work in
London will find that Liphook is within commuting distance.
Lloyd's is not severing its link with the City entirely. It is keeping one
of its City buildings, the listed Fenchurch Street headquarters by Thomas
Collcutt - one of the finest turn-of-the-century buildings in the City - for
the use of senior staff, particularly those involved in marketing. It
intends to use videoconferencing facilities to communicate between London
and Liphook.
Nonetheless, it is hard to dispute the conclusion that Lloyd's decision to
move is a blow for London. Central London has lost about 60,000 jobs over
the past seven years through relocations. The flight of companies, which
reached record levels in 1991, has slowed down as a result of the recession.
But as Lloyd's decision shows, the City cannot take the continued presence
of even its oldest companies for granted.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Sounds of the cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The success of Steven Spielberg's film Jurassic Park has brought reflected
glory to a three-year old Belfast technology company.
Audio Processing Technology, which has a staff of just 20, is providing the
vital component in the cinema sound system which gives digital, rather than
analogue, dinosaur roars.
APT has developed a way of compressing the soundtrack of the film so that it
can be put on a compact disc which is synchronised to play alongside the
film.
The idea for digital sound first came from Spielberg himself, who wanted to
explore the idea of a superior soundtrack to accompany his blockbuster.
Spielberg, along with Universal Studios and others, was instrumental in
setting up the Californian company Digital Theatre Systems which builds the
cinema playback systems which incorporate APT's technology
Demand for the sound systems has grown to such an extent that APT's managing
director Stephen Smyth believes that there will be more than 5,000 cinemas
using the system by the end of year - as far apart as the US, Japan and
Europe.
The compression algorithm squeezes the sound into one quarter of the space
usually needed by removing the redundancy in the soundtrack. This means the
six-channel stereo soundtrack can be supplied on CD. The technique is not
dissimilar to that used by Sony to compress music on to its mini-disc
system.
Smyth points out the chips can also be used in the transmission of calls
over the latest digital telephone lines or the preparation of soundtracks
for television programmes.
Cinemas not equipped with the digital system can still show Jurassic Park
because, as is conventional in film recording, each film has the analogue
soundtrack of blood-curdling screams and the pounding of prehistoric feet
optically recorded alongside the pictures.
A further advantage of this, reassures Smith, is that should the latest
digital equipment break down, the projection would automatically revert to
the analogue soundtrack.

FT  30 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Values improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial property values have risen for the first time in more than three
and a half years, according to the June figures compiled by the Investment
Property Databank, a research group.
A rise in values across all the sectors pushed the capital growth index up
by 0.5 per cent for the month. The improvement stemmed from a further
shortening of yields, which dropped from 9.9 per cent to 9.8 per cent.
However, rental values continued to decline, leaving the all property rental
growth index at its lowest level since December 1989.
The all property total return stood at 2.5 per cent for the second quarter
of 1993, against 0.8 per cent for the first.
Capital growth showed a marked improvement over the previous quarter,
averaging 0.2 per cent, but rental values fell by 3 per cent compared with
their 2.5 per cent decline in the quarter to March.
The recovery of the first six months of the year will, if it persists at
roughly the same rate, be sufficient to produce an end-of-year return to the
IPD monthly index of between 5 and 7 per cent.
Retails were the best performing sector in June at 1.5 per cent, compared
with 0.6 per cent in May.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (11): Financial sclerosis - Health care is
lesss impressive than it seems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISS Yoko Hirokawa, a 19 year old student, is one of many Japanese patients
who have received liver transplant operations in Australia.
She went there because of the lack of fresh organs to be used in
transplants. This is due to the Japanese law which refuses to define
brain-dead persons, the principal source of transplant organs, as legally
dead.
However, although parliament is discussing a redefinition of death to allow
organ transplants in Japan, the country's healthcare system may stand in the
way of such innovative treatments.
Miss Hirokawa had her operation only after raising ADollars 140,000 through
donations and loans not covered by Japan's insurance. Such costs mean that
even when transplants are approved in Japan, only those who can afford such
services will be treated.
The Japanese system assures broad access to care as well as low fees through
cost sharing and government negotiated fees for services and supplies.
However, rigid cost control methods cause mounting frustration for patients.
In theory, all Japanese are covered either through company plans or national
health insurance. In the US, on the other hand, 13 to 15 per cent of
citizens have no health insurance at any one time.
At present, 31.4 per cent of health care costs in Japan are met by central
and municipal governments, 56.3 per cent by the premium payers, which
includes employers, and 12.1 per cent by the patient.
Comparing Japan's longevity and infant mortality rates with those in the US,
the Japanese system may seem superior. In Japan, the life expectancy for men
is 76 years and for women 82 years, compared with 72 for men and 78.8 for
women in the US.
The infant mortality rate is 4.6 per 1,000 live births in Japan, exactly
half the US rate.
However, a visit to a Japanese hospital for treatment reveals the negative
side of this apparently impressive health system.
The hospital is probably dingy and the patient will have to wait for over an
hour in a crowded waiting room before seeing a doctor.
There is little interaction between patient and doctor. Instead, the patient
will be dismissed with a long list of drugs, prescribed with scant
explanation of his illness or of the nature of the medication.
Such procedures stem partly from the heavy cost controls which militate
against new procedures and technology.
The fee structure is determined in detail every two years by the Central
Social Medical Care Council in the light of financial reviews of hospitals
and clinics and the types and frequency of medical treatment.
This helps to prevent sharp increases in costs, but also tends to stultify
medical services.
According to Pat Murdo, analyst at Japan Economic Institute in Washington
DC, the council curbs costs by delaying approval to pay for new procedures
and technologies.
The delays have the advantage of ensuring that the government has time to
ensure the effectiveness of new techniques. But critics fear that delays in
diffusing new methods work to the detriment of patients who cannot afford to
pay privately for life-saving treatments.
Emphasis on cheaper primary treatment also helps doctors to identify
symptoms before they turn into serious ailments. But such controls result in
low quality service which most patients face - long waiting lists and
limited communication with the physician.
Meanwhile, as doctors are reimbursed for the drugs that they prescribe, they
tend to overdispense. In 1991, drug costs in Japan comprised 42.7 per cent
of total medical costs; in the UK they were only 11.7 per cent and in the US
only 9.3 per cent.
At the same time, recent efforts by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to
cut official costs of older, less innovative drugs have resulted in the
prescription of new drugs, especially antibiotics.
The rigid reimbursement system also fails to address the wage increases and
demands for shorter working hour by medical staff. Iroren - the Japan
Federation of Medical Workers' Unions - asserts that medical staff are
'overburdened and scarcely able to maintain normal life and health' due to
restrictions in the growth of health care costs.
In Japan, there are 33.6 nurses to 100 beds, compared with 40.2 in the UK
and 55.1 in the US.
According to Iroren, 60 per cent of health workers work more than six night
shifts a month, with the medical staff working an average of nine night
shifts.
Further technological advances in treatment and the ageing of the population
may eventually prove too much for the health system.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (12): A weakness for discipline -
Traditionalism still rules in most schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO'S most prestigious fee-paying boys school owes nothing to the
tradition of Eton or Harrow. Housed in undistinguished concrete in the urban
Hiroo district of the city, Azabu Gakuen looks like a product of the 1960s
heyday of comprehensive education in the UK.
That resemblance runs more than skin deep: the relaxed attitude of the
teachers, casual dress and unruly classrooms are evidence of a liberal
attitude never embraced by the bastions of the British public school
tradition.
But Azabu is far from representative of Japanese schools. It can afford to
go against the grain because it gets results. It sends a higher proportion
of pupils to prestigious universities, notably Tokyo University, than almost
any other school. In the eyes of status-conscious Japanese parents, that is
the sole barometer of success.
Although fee-paying, entrance to Azabu is by competitive examination only.
In that respect it is very much a product of the Japanese system. It
prospers by its ability to get pupils through the university entrance
examinations, and sets its own entrance examinations to cream off the best
pupils.
To stand a fighting chance of getting to Azabu, and thence to Tokyo
University, most pupils will have already passed entrance examinations to
win a place at a good preparatory school. For many the process of testing
will have started at the age of three.
'We can afford to be liberal because our pupils are all keen to learn and
want to succeed,' said Mr Takao Negishi, Azabu's headmaster.
Faced with intense competition at every stage - and pupils generally less
blessed with diligence or intellect than Azabu - mainstream Japanese schools
favour a disciplinarian approach. At Takamatsu Junior High, a model state
school in suburban Tokyo, a strict code of uniform, punctuality and good
behaviour prevails.
That might be enough to make traditionalists in many European countries weep
with nostalgia.
The role of testing, the existence of a national curriculum and a thriving
private sector would equally win plaudits among conservative educationalists
in the UK.
Conversely, though, the approach is now being questioned in Japan. For
example, while in principle the national curriculum has almost universal
support among Japanese teachers, the design of the current curriculum is
seen to place too much emphasis on the accumulation of facts while
neglecting creative thought.
There is some sympathy with this view within the Ministry of Education. Its
interest does not stem from liberal sentiment: the over-riding question for
government is whether Japanese schools are producing the workforce required
by the service and high-technology industries of the future.
Even though Japan spends less on education as a percentage of gross domestic
product than its industrial rivals - classes of 40 pupils per teacher are
the norm - it achieves higher rates of literacy and numeracy. The worry is
that such basic skills no longer suffice. Yet while the main function of
schooling is - in the eyes of many parents - to propel children up the
educational pyramid with Tokyo University at its apex, piecemeal reform of
the curriculum is unlikely to transform the system. Schools like Azabu are
free to tailor tuition to fit the requirements of university entrance
examinations. For example, ninth grade pupils at Azabu spend six hours per
week on mathematics.
AT TAKAMATSU pupils of the same grade receive only four hours tuition - as
demanded by the national curriculum. If the state sector strays too far from
the three-R's, the gulf between public and private schools will only widen.
The emphasis on examinations has also created an industry of 'juku' or
cramming schools, which children are expected to attend outside normal hours
for extra tuition in core academic subjects. Like Azabu, the better juku do
not come cheap. That raises the question whether a traditionally egalitarian
education system - what could be more egalitarian than a system based
squarely on entrance examinations? - is now failing the poor.
The growth of private schools is also adding to the problem of falling rolls
as Japan passes through demographic changes more pronounced than in the UK.
Takamatsu's newly refurbished buildings now house 469 pupils, against more
than 1,500 in the mid-1980s. The encroachment of private schools means still
fewer pupils, and can cause problems in the classroom.
'The best pupils in this area are more likely to attend private schools. The
natural leaders are taken out of our classes. 'There is no problem with
discipline, but motivating the remaining pupils to learn has become more
difficult,' said Mr Makoto Kawashima, headmaster at Takamatsu.
The Ministry of Education sees two options to close the gap between public
and private education: either deregulate the state sector, allowing public
schools to imitate fee-paying schools, or regulate the private sector by
imposing the national curriculum strictly across the board.
Neither option is particularly attractive. The first would only reinforce
the reputation of Japanese schools as rigorous crammers and increase
examination pressures. The second would require heavy-handed intervention in
a private school system which has widespread support among parents.
Ultimately, though, change may have to filter down through the system from
the top before the style of Japanese education changes. 'Higher education in
Japan has historically emphasised imitation rather than innovation.
Since the end of the last century that has been seen as the way for Japan to
compete successfully with the West,' commented Mr Michio Nagai, an
educationalist and former Minister of Education. 'For these historical
reasons, Japan has not developed a tradition of basic academic research.'
Admission to even the best universities is regarded by students as a
comfortable interlude between the pressure of school and the horrors of life
as a 'salary-man'. University entrance exams are thus tests of accumulated
knowledge rather than measures of academic potential.
Only if universities value creativity and spontaneity are parents likely to
put pressure on schools to do the same. If an education system is a mirror
of the society it serves, there can be no more eloquent commentary on the
growing pains of Japan itself.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (9): China becomes a competitor - Japan's
biggest neighbour offers openings and challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association began collecting information
this month in an attempt to prove that Chinese manufacturers were dumping
fabric in the Japanese market, it was also gathering evidence that economic
and political ties between the two countries are changing.
The cotton spinners complain that Chinese producers are damaging their
industry by exporting materials for 30 to 40 per cent less than the selling
price of the domestic product, echoing the past concerns of US producers
about lower-cost Japanese textile exports in the early days of the economic
rise from the wartime rubble.
Japanese government officials are embarrassed by the cotton case, as they
are leading the debate over reform of anti-dumping procedures, often used to
keep markets closed to more competitive products. But the emerging might of
China has already prompted Tokyo to be the aggressor for the first time,
imposing penalties this year on Chinese exporters of ferrosilicon manganese,
which is used in steel production.
These cases highlight the ambivalence of Japanese industry towards China.
The Chinese market provides remarkable opportunities for export growth,
particularly compared with the sluggish demand from other international
markets and the declining demand at home, where companies have excess
production capacity after a capital spending surge during the late 1980s.
However, the improvement in the Chinese production quality, often aided by
the transfer of Japanese technology and expertise, has already undermined
the profitability of textile producers and other industries are conscious of
a threat from China. Garment makers in Kyushu, in the south, estimate that
two-thirds of their number will be forced to close factories by the end of
next year.
In the first half, Japan's exports to China rose 51.2 per cent from a year
earlier, with exports of cars six times larger and those of television
cameras increasing fourfold, while exports of steel, communications
equipment, motorcycles and construction equipment all doubled. Over the same
period, China's exports to Japan expanded 15.2 per cent, with a tripling of
office machinery exports, most made in Japanese-run joint venture factories.
The increasing Japanese business confidence in China's economic refroms has
coincided with the need for Japanese manufacturers to reduce costs to
improve profitability after three years of falling earnings. Combined with
the lure of China's domestic demand, companies have concluded that the
conditions are finally right for direct investments that they were reluctant
to make in the past.
Last year, Japanese direct investment in China doubled and, in recent
months, a company has announced a new factory, outlet or partnership in
China each day. Nissan Motor has just formed a joint venture to produce jet
looms in Shenyang, in the north, while Toshiba has stretched its service
network by opening new branches in Jinan, in the east, and Kunming, in the
south-west.
The interest extends to securities houses. Nomura Securities, the country's
largest broker, has been chosen as lead manager for the Hong Kong listing of
Dongfang Electric, a mainland power company based in Sichuan province.
Nomura, cutting employees in Europe, has increased its Asia department
personnel from 580 to 616 over the past year and shifted the operation's
base to Hong Kong from Tokyo.
Mr Hideo Sakamaki, Nomura's president, said cultivating business in China
takes longer than elsewhere: 'You need a long-term perspective. Over a
decade or two decades you can build a human network - that is how you do
business in that country.'
Not every Japanese company has the patience or the funds to wait so long for
a return, and there is concern in Tokyo that the measures taken by Beijing
to cool an overheating economy could lessen the short-term opportunities to
profit from China. An official at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said past attempts to reassert control of the economy have been
heavy handed, and it remains to be seen if Beijing has learned from those
errors.
The tangible power of the emerging China has also stirred debate in Tokyo on
whether Chinese political and military influence in the region will also be
overwhelming. Japanese defence analysts have advised the government to take
more interest in the consequences of rising Chinese military spending and
weapons renovation.
Publicly, Japanese officials are careful not to offend China, but, in
private, they suggest that US concerns about the expansion of Japanese
influence in Asia should be redirected to the rapid growth of Chinese
influence in the region. One finance ministry official complained that the
US is 'looking in the wrong direction when they worry about a yen bloc in
Asia', and should pay 'far more attention to the changes in China'.
Within the foreign ministry, which would like Japan to take an active role
in the international arms debate, there is division over whether pressure
should be applied to China on military issues, backed by the implied threat
that the flow of Japanese financial assistance could slow if Beijing does
not exercise restraint.
In the past, Tokyo has not wanted to tackle China on sensitive political
issues. Japanese officials have been reluctant to express clear support for
the proposed expansion of democracy in Hong Kong and, in private meetings
with Chinese, are said to express dismay that the UK is creating
'instability' in the territory.
But the emerging strength of China has not only ruffled the cotton spinners;
it is also forcing the Japanese government to redefine a relationship partly
based on the idea that Tokyo could score points with Beijing by
'representing' its interests in international gatherings and ensuring that
China would not be 'isolated'.
Dealing with an increasingly confident China will be less simple in the
future, and the Japanese government will need to develop a broader set of
principles that takes into account demands ranging from its own ambitions
for a higher profile in Asia to the interests of the cotton spinners.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (10): Nintendo versus Sega - A world war
rages over electronic games sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VISIT to Nintendo's head office in Kyoto belies its position as the
world's leading supplier of youth entertainment. The modest premises could
belong to any family-run Japanese company, the atmosphere is formal and
restrained. Despite generating multi-million dollar sales, the impression is
of a company that has not lost touch with its roots as a manufacturer of
playing cards.
The public face of Sega - its arch-rival in the battle for the hearts, minds
and leisure time of a generation - is rather different. At its modern office
complex in suburban Tokyo, visitors are not plied with green tea from china
cups but with Coke from a vending machine. The fast cars and motor bikes
parked outside reflect a corporate culture in line with its reputation as
the Young Turk of the video entertainment business.
The difference between the two companies also runs to industrial strategy.
Nintendo has made a conscious decision to keep its overheads low, so most
manufacturing is contracted to outside suppliers. Despite being Japan's
third largest company measured by profits, Nintendo has fewer than 900
employees. It resembles a management company, co-ordinating its empire
through a network of licensed subcontractors.
That reflects the low-cost philosophy of Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, the company's
president. In a new, volatile market such as video entertainment he believes
Nintendo should be able to respond quickly. It would thus be unwise for the
company to follow motor manufacturers, for example, by building expensive
production facilities.
Sega has taken a more conventional approach. It employs 800 in research and
development alone, out of a total workforce in Japan of 3,500. Most of the
games played on Sega machines have been designed by the company itself,
rather than outside companies working under licence.
The unanswered question is which company will be able to capture the new
technologies - such as more CD-based entertainment systems which can handle
much more information than conventional software cartridges - which look
certain to transform the market. Nintendo is taking a relaxed,
self-confident approach to new technology. It argues that the full potential
of cartridge-based systems, running on the latest 16-bit games computers,
has yet to be exploited by games designers. Until that happens, it sees no
need to rush into other formats.
'Other areas of art and entertainment prove that the drive for technological
change always comes from the makers of software - the artists. That has been
true of areas such as cinema. I believe it is also true of this business,'
commented Mr Masayuki Uemura, general manager of Nintendo's research and
development.
He argues that the new technologies will not necessarily allow games
designers and software engineers, the artists of the video entertainment
business, to produce better games. The companies now investing vast sums in
development may thus be disappointed. It is certainly true that Nintendo's
8-bit Family Computer, on which its dominance of the market rests, was
hardly state of the art when it was launched 10 years ago. But the machine
was sufficiently powerful to test the software engineers and chea priced low
enough to sell.
NEITHER Nintendo nor Sega expects to make large profits from selling the
hardware itself. The games consoles are simply the medium by which a
continuing market for new games is created. Having bought a Nintendo system
the consumer is locked into buying games from the same source. Unless new
technology is priced low enough to sell in volume, there is no hope of
creating a lucrative mass market for software.
The argument is logical. But outside investors have their doubts. Nintendo's
shares peaked against the Japanese stock market in 1990, while Sega has
continued to rise. Sega was first to launch a more powerful 16-bit games
computer - its Megadrive system - which allowed the company to win market
share from Nintendo. Sega now has 40 per cent of the market in the US and
Europe.
Sega has adopted a typically aggressive policy towards new technology,
forming joint ventures with companies ranging from IBM and Pioneer to Time
Warner and W Industries - a small British company which specialises in
virtual reality products. Sega's ambitions run well beyond video games.
'We will expand the market with these alliances. By collaborating in CD-ROM
technology, for example, we will be able to introduce elements of publishing
or education into our products,' said Mr Hideki Sato, director of R&amp;D at
Sega.
By pursuing its ambitions in so many areas, Sega is running risks of its
own. Other areas of consumer electronics have been blighted by the inability
of manufacturers to agree on common standards. There must be a danger of the
same thing happening again. The giants of consumer electronics are pouring
resources into CD-ROM technology and not all will be successful.
Mr Sato admits it may take 10 years before an industry standard CD-ROM is
established. But he believes Sega's best chance of being among the winners
lies in getting its products to market first.
For the time being Nintendo seems content to let Sega make the running. The
risk facing Nintendo is that a competitor using proprietory technology -
possibly Sega, but perhaps 3DO of the US - will develop a system which is a
quantum leap not just in technological prowess but also in entertainment
value.
Should that happen Nintendo believes it will be able to get access to new
technology, in the best Japanese tradition of picking up ideas from rivals
and making them better. The history of Nintendo in the 1980s demonstrates
that successful home entertainment products are not the most advanced, but
the most cleverly manufactured and marketed. Having taken a back seat in the
drive for technology itself, though, Nintendo will have to repeat the trick.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (7): In two minds about Bill - Michiyo
Nakamoto finds mixed attitudes towards the US president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A country where youth is still associated mostly with inexperience and
naivete, the reaction to a young and earnest US President has been as
schizophrenic as the relationship between the two countries in recent years.
Many Japanese have warmed to President Bill Clinton's enthusiasm and his
approachable style. Some have seen in his show of youthful determination a
glimmer of hope for the renewal and revitalisation of the US.
But at the same time, the Japanese public has been outraged by the tough
demands made on their own government by the US under Mr Clinton.
The Japanese popular view of Mr Clinton has been very much a direct result
of the different approaches the US President has employed in his dealings
with Japan.
On his visit to Tokyo for the Group of Seven Summit meeting earlier this
month, the US President went out of his way to take his message directly to
the Japanese public, presumably with the hope of spreading some goodwill
along the way.
Mr Clinton gave the Japanese public a first-hand taste of his informal style
when he addressed a group of students at Waseda University - a generation
more likely to relate to his view of things, not to mention his style - and
then ventured to chat with residents in the neighbourhood.
The event went down well with the Japanese press which featured front-page
photos of the US president meeting school children and waving to an amateur
baseball team.
However, Mr Clinton's easy-going ways have not altered his reputation in
Japan as something of a bully, determined to wrest concessions from Japan on
trade.
US demands that Japan reduce its current account surplus from 3 per cent of
GDP to between 2 and 1 per cent within three years and raise the ratio of
imports to GDP by 30 per cent have been seen to be heavy-handed.
Comments from US officials which led to the sharp rise of the yen have been
interpreted as a sign that the Clinton administration would use whatever
means it has available to reduce its trade deficit with Japan.
A joint survey conducted last month by the television companies TBS in Japan
and CBS in the US and The New York Times, found that 76 per cent of the
Japanese respondents did not trust Clinton and 85 per cent believed the US
was blaming Japan for its own economic problems.
Politicians and bureaucrats have also expressed unhappiness with the way the
relationship has gone under the new administration, but they have tended to
blame the Clinton trade team's relative inexperience and the apparent lack
of a clearly defined Japan policy for the increased friction.
Taking a somewhat more philosophical approach, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, until
recently Japan's Prime Minister, along with a host of political commentators
and academics, have seen the tougher US stance on trade with Japan as an
indication that the bilateral relationship has reached a turning point.
The tougher stance of the Clinton administration towards Japan, according to
this school of thinking, is a direct result of a shift in the world order in
which the US can no longer be expected to play the role of the tolerant
superpower. As such, it was more a sign of weakness than of strength on the
part of the US and a development that requires Japan to play a more
assertive role in the bilateral relationship.
Mr Miyazawa explained on Japanese TV that Mr Clinton's predecessor, George
Bush, who was shot down near the Japanese islands during World War Two,
belonged to a generation of Americans that thought they were responsible for
shaping post-war Japan and therefore took a more protective stance towards
the country.
MR CLINTON'S relationship with Japan is very different, the prime minister
pointed out. Mr Clinton grew up in an America that watched TV on
Japanese-made sets and drove Japanese cars. 'To him, Japan has always been
an adult,' Mr Miyazawa said.
Sensing that this new order calls for them to stand on their own feet, the
Japanese authorities have taken a harder stance against US demands.
Calls on Japan to set numerical benchmarks which would measure progress in
opening up its markets to foreign goods, and in particular, to set a target
for reducing its current account surplus, have been vigorously resisted on
the grounds that such action would lead to managed trade.
Unilateral action by the US, such as the recent ruling by the Commerce
Department to impose anti-dumping duties on steel imports, have been met
with counter-threats to take the issue to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Such resentment and frustration felt in Japan towards the Clinton
administration's handling of trade friction with Japan runs a serious risk
of further aggravating bilateral relations.
If President Clinton's generation of Americans see Japan primarily as an
economic power, a growing number of Japanese in positions of influence
regard the US as 'a declining power that is blaming others for its own
shortcomings,' says Mr Yoshio Terasawa, a former vice president of Nomura
Securities who is now a member of the Japan New Party.
Fortunately, spreading irritation with the US is still generally tempered by
the view that much of what the US is demanding is either for the country's
long-term good or is something that Japan needs to face up to sooner or
later.
Government bureaucrats, such as those at the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry who jealously guard the interests of domestic industry, admit
that Japan must try to open its markets more not because of US pressure but
to bring its practices in line with rest of the world.
Even the tabloid press has portrayed the US president as a friend of the
Japanese consumer. The daily Gendai pointed out that the president's remark
to the G7 - that Japan has the ability to further stimulate its economy -
revealed to the Japanese public what the Japanese government had so far
failed demonstrate - that it still has the financial means to invest in
social infrastructure, lower taxes and generally improve the lot of the
average consumer.
The consensus so far in Japan is that these mixed feelings of resentment and
goodwill are the natural outcome of a relationship that is moving
increasingly towards a more equal partnership. As Foreign Minister Kabun
Muto, who compares the relationship to that of two sumo wrestlers who are
brothers, puts it, 'there's a feeling of rivalry. But they're still
brothers.'

new role in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN was a sleeping partner in the cold war. It is just starting to wake up
to the fact that it is over.
Japan's nuclear pacifism meant it was never a direct participant in the
nuclear stand off which was central to the cold war. Yet it was active in
the wings, as a US ally.
The Japanese economy's growth in the 1950s was partly attributable to US
spending on the Korean war. In the 1980s the rise in the US federal deficit,
partly a result of higher defence spending, also helped the Japanese economy
to grow.
Throughout the cold war Japan accepted the US foreign policy and security
lead. Sheltering beneath this umbrella Japan pursued its main aim to develop
its economy. The US accepted that Japan should play this limited role as
long as it was a powerful economic and democratic buffer against the
expansion of communism in Asia.
This rationale for the US relationship with Japan no longer holds good. As a
result Japan is having to embark on a painful, slow, highly sensitive search
for a new international role.
This search involves several components. Most important is a renegotiation
of its relationship with the US. This renegotiation has just started with
the recently concluded US-Japan framework for trade talks to reduce the
ballooning Japanese trade surplus. It may go further into the nature of the
security and political alliance between the two countries.
The Russian military threat is receding. The US now views Japan as an arch
economic competitor. Worse than that there are new tensions in their
approach to the post cold war world. The US Clinton administration has
championed a more active western engagement with Russian reform. Japan has
found this difficult because its territorial dispute with Russian over the
islands off the northern tip of Japan is still unresolved.
Japan's search for a role is complicated by the changing balance of power
within Asia. Japan is more aware of the need for an effective security
framework in Asia as the economic and military power of China grows and the
fate of communist north Korea remains uncertain.
The speed and uncertainty of events in the post cold war world has also
exposed Tokyo's foreign policy making. Japan's bureaucracy works best when
it has clear precedents to follow to guide its decisions. In the post cold
war world of ethnic and nationalist tensions in Europe and Asia such
precedents are hard to find or buried in history. So Japan has often been
caught out by the speed with which crises have developed, principally the
Gulf War in 1991.
The immediate focus of Japan's efforts to develop a new world role will be
its hopes of becoming a permanent security council member of the United
Nations. Japan hopes to gain a permanent seat in 1995. Such a responsibility
would force it to make faster, harder decisions about what should be done in
moments of crisis. This will almost certainly require more than changes to
the way foreign policy is made. It will demand changes of substance as well.
Several camps are competing to provide Japan with a new foreign policy lead
into the post cold war world.
The traditionalists on both left and right believe that Japan is a 'special
state'. Its history of wartime aggression and, most important, its
subjection to nuclear bombing make it exceptional, the traditionalists
argue.
They believe Japan should accept as a principle a modest international role
because it can never become an international military force, even in the
cause of peace. The traders, such as Mr Noahiro Amaya, former vice-minister
at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, see Japan as a
commercial democracy. Miti is still the bastion of this view.
The traders believe Japan should model itself on the great trading powers of
the 15th and 16th centuries, such as the Netherlands. According to this
view, Japan is the world's merchant, the US is the world's samurai. Japan
should assess diplomatic initiatives against their financial returns.
These traditional and trading views of Japan's foreign policy are now being
challenged by a new realism, underpinned by a nationalism in Japanese
culture, that Japan is different and more successful than many western
powers.
The new realists are best represented by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-founder of the
Japan Renewal Party which made impressive gains in the election. The new
realists believe Japan can no longer afford an isolationist pacificism. Its
international partners will see it as a free rider, using the world's
trading system but doing little to protect it.
The realists believe the 1991 Gulf war showed that a cash-based approach to
diplomacy does not work. After much debate, Japan contributed Dollars 13bn
to a war effort that most Japanese did not support. Yet the nation feels it
received only grudging thanks from its international partners, who accused
it of dragging its feet.
The realists argue that the link with the US should be strengthened: Japan
should contribute more to international security through finance, personnel
and technology. Japan's political institutions should be reformed to create
a two-party political system, which would generate open debate on Japan's
foreign policy priorities.
Yet, they say, Japan should not simply follow the US. There is a nationalism
mixed into their realism. They believe Japan should represent an Asian view
of the world, especially on economic issues, where the US and Europe could
learn from the Far East's dynamism.
The end of the cold war has unleashed nationalism in much of Europe. Such a
movement will always remain politically muted in Japan, for fear of
rekindling other countries' fears that it harbours imperial ambitions.
Yet there is an increasingly powerful sense of national pride in Japan
stemming from the contrast between its economic achievements and social
stability and America's economic and social malaise, symbolised to many
Japanese by the spread of drugs, urban violence and divorce.
The Yoshida doctrine was framed when Japan was vulnerable. Japan's future
foreign policy, however it is made and whoever will make it, will reflect
its growing national confidence.
The accession of the new realists into positions of power in Japan will
bring benefits and costs for the west. Japan will play a more active world
role, but the west will also find it tougher to bargain with.

IF ASKED to name the prickliest industrialised western power, many Japanese
would probably cite France.
Paris's attitude to Tokyo has been sensitive ever since General de Gaulle
insultingly described a visiting Japanese prime minister as a transistor
salesman. Former French prime minister Edith Cresson's description of Japan
as a nation of ants shows that some circles at least still recently held
serious anxieties over a Japanese threat.
However, Mrs Cresson's anti-Japanese gibes were made two years ago. Since
then, the Paris government has staged a sustained diplomatic charm offensive
and its complexes about Japan have begun to melt. NEC, the electronics
company, has been allowed to take a stake in Bull, the French state-owned
computer maker formerly seen as an exclusive national asset, while the Paris
government hardly turned a hair when state-owned Renault's Swedish partner
Volvo, formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi.
The two countries' bilateral relationship is of secondary value to both,
since their diplomacy centres on bigger partners with whom they also have
occasionally uneasy relationships; Germany in France's case and the US in
Japan's. Yet this odd couple is important because revealing parallels lie
just under their differences.
This will surprise most people, for whom Japan and France could not be more
of a contrast. On the diplomatic front, both are grappling with the changes
caused by the break up of the Soviet Union, and producing very different
responses. France uneasily faces a stronger Germany but vigorously defends
its position as a top European power, while Japan has yet to carve out a
role for itself in a confused and potentially volatile south-east Asia as
its security links with the US become less important. Meanwhile, Tokyo's
traditional reluctance to assert itself - never a French problem - faces an
unprecedented test in the face of the Clinton administration's demands for
better access for US exports.
On the domestic front, one factor that successive French and Japanese
governments have in common is that they have for decades believed that the
state should take a hand in valuable national industries.
While the results of intervention have been dramatically different in Japan
and France, the assumptions are similar. There are differences in approach,
in that the Japanese state's guiding hand is traditionally subtle and
appears to follow or anticipate the market's natural direction, rather than
try to shape it, while France is well known for the heavy industrial
interventionism it has practised through its extensive public sector.
Yet their approaches have converged slightly in recent years. France's new
centre-right government has accelerated the reduction in industrial
intervention cautiously begun by the Socialists. Meanwhile, Japan's
conservative government has returned to intervention to soften the economic
downturn.
The bureaucracies that carry out and help shape these policies also have
similarities. Both are controlled by a tiny civil service elite, that
carries enormous weight in their finance and industry ministries.
The members of these public administration elites are both drawn from a
meritocratic and demanding state education system. In France's case, the
inner circle will often consist of graduates of the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration (Ena), a prestigious civil service college set up after the
second world war to help rebuild the shattered public administration.
The nearest Japanese equivalent is Tokyo University law department, whose
brilliant young graduates took a prominent part in targeting key sectors for
development in Japan's high-speed post war economic growth. One key contrast
is that Ena graduates move between the civil service and politics much more
often than the top people in Japan's public administration, though in both
countries there is a steady flow of senior public servants into business.
The aims and the structure of the two public administrations are, however,
very different. France, for example, has no equivalent of Japan's Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (Miti), the powerful department which
has co-ordinated industrial policy since before the second world war.
THE Paris government did once flirt with the idea of creating a French Miti,
when Mrs Cresson tried to create a super-ministry, embracing industry,
telecommunications, trade and part of the finance ministry - perhaps a sign
that her attitude to Japan concealed some admiration. But the finance
minister of the time, the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy, managed to sink the
scheme, a grave threat to his own ministry's traditional dominance.
Japan has responded calmly to French complexes over its economic power and
intentions. Its government has delivered no verbal counterblasts.
Nevertheless, Nissan and Toyota quietly shunned France in their first wave
of plant investment in Europe, despite France's geographical advantage at
the heart of the European single market.
This continues to be an irritant, as France has emerged with Italy as a
leader in attempts to curb exports from UK-based Japanese car plants,
described by Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot, as a Japanese aircraft
carrier moored off the coast of Europe. By contrast, some French
politicians, such as Mr Roger Fauroux, former industry minister, sincerely
regret missing out on these prestige investments.
French investment in Japan is unsurprisingly minimal, yet France has not
done too badly in attracting Japanese investment, despite missing the car
plants. Datar, the French regional development agency, recently counted 122
Japanese companies in France, the second best European score after Britain's
187, though the gap is much wider in cash terms.
All this has done nothing to diminish Japanese consumers' love affair with
French culture of all kinds. Japanese consumers still continue to represent
one of the biggest markets for French luxury goods as well as an
increasingly substantial slice of tourist income, as the yen's strength
reduces the price of a Parisian holiday for Japanese travellers. Japan
continues to be one of the largest markets for French art, as can be seen by
the paintings that continue to hang in the Tokyo head offices of banks and
industrial companies, despite the economic slowdown.
On both sides, the relationship is complex, mingled with admiration and
apprehension.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (4): Too bad to admit - The banks' debt
burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN protesting that they have learned the lessons of the easy money era of
the late 1980s, Japanese banks stumble when asked to explain the continuing
close ties to ailing developers such as Azabu Tatemono and EIE
International, which have extensive property holdings and even larger piles
of debt.
One reason, often unstated, is that the banks are reluctant to reveal the
full extent of their exposure to these companies. Another is the old
justification that these developers are too big to let slip, as their fall
would shatter confidence in an already battered Japanese property market.
But, departing from this tradition, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
announced this month that EIE International, with outstanding debt
conservatively estimated at Y700bn, will have to fend for itself. Five bank
managers transferred to the company have returned to the bank, which has
promised to write off the losses arising from its loans of Y190bn, about
half of which are estimated to be bad.
The EIE case has stirred debate in Japan over whether the banks are now
prepared to own up to bad debts and deal with them aggressively, in contrast
to the past practice of understating the exposure and stretching out the
write offs over a decade or more. The latter approach had the blessing of
the Ministry of Finance, which thought it would maintain confidence in the
system and limit the losses to tax revenue arising from write offs.
It was natural that LTCB, and four other leading banks linked to EIE, should
be nervous about the reaction to the unusual tack of admitting to problems.
On the day of the announcement, one slightly giddy banker asked this
journalist: 'What do you think about our decision? Do you think it is a good
thing?'
But it is not clear that the EIE case marks a turning point in the attitude
of Japanese banks to their problem loans. The company is a maverick, with a
bizarre collection of trophy properties, ranging from a floating hotel in
Vietnam to a private university in Queensland. Its president, Harunori
Takahashi, is definitely not mainstream, having retreated to the golf course
when told that his bankers were cutting their losses.
Importantly, much of EIE International's portfolio is outside Japan, meaning
that the impact on the domestic property market is limited. Harder evidence
of a new attitude to problem loans would be presented if a bank put pressure
on a more mainstream developer, and if banks revised their present narrow
definition of a non-performing loan.
Officially, the country's 11 leading commercial banks have Y8,400bn in
non-performing loans, but that figure is unofficially estimated to be about
half the actual total. Restructurings in which interest rates are cut to
almost zero are not counted, nor are affiliates' bad loans, even though the
bank will be ultimately responsible for clearing away the debris.
Nippon Credit Bank, one the country's three long-term credit banks, is
burdened by bad loans from three financial affiliates, which it says are not
technically its responsibility. However, when dealing with the affiliates,
most customers saw the respectable figure of NCB looming behind, as is the
case with even the distant affiliates of other large institutions.
The bank estimated its non-performing loans at end March to be Y592bn,
though prominent reports in a Japanese magazine claiming to be based on
internal documents from the bank have suggested the figure is higher. NCB
officials say the 'worst is over' and that the arrival as president of a
former finance ministry official, Mr Hiroshi Kubota, has helped morale.
NCB is a good example of the difficulty of measuring the depth of bruising
in the country's banking system. Instead of bad loan figures, the bank
emphasises that business profits rose 68 per cent last year and that its
capital adequacy ratio, as defined by the Bank for International
Settlements, was 9 per cent at end March, up from 8.32 per cent a year
earlier, and easily above the 8 per cent target figure.
The finance ministry says the announcement of non-performing loan figures is
intended to restore confidence in the banking system, as they show that the
damage is not as severe as rumoured. But banks, and the ministry, are still
unwilling to highlight the differences among the institutions, even though
the quality of loan portfolios varies greatly.
Most attention has been given to the larger Japanese banks, but cracks are
also appearing in institutions such as smaller regional banks and the local
shinkin banks. These institutions are suffering most during the economic
downturn, particularly if they are already burdened by problem loans arising
from the bubble era.
The collapse of Kamaishi Shinkin last month and a rush of mergers among
other smaller banks and credit associations have highlighted the pressures
on these institutions. It is understood that about 11 troubled shinkin banks
are receiving low interest loans from their parent association, and the
longer the economic downturn, the more assistance will be required.
Kamaishi's failure was linked to its role as the provider of funds to small
businesses in a coastal area in northern Japan, not to rash lending to stock
or property speculators. About half of the bank's loan portfolio of Y35.6bn
is reckoned to be bad and it will be liquidated in October, when 12 branches
will be taken over by regional banks.
The disappearance of Kamaishi Shinkin, whose mistake was to keep the funds
flowing to faithful but struggling clients, shows that a streamlining of the
banking system is occurring, though not as quickly as was generally
predicted.
Japanese banks are still resisting the pressure to change, but, as the
Kamaishi case shows, there comes a time when the institutions can resist no
more.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (3): Beating an orderly retreat - Michiyo
Nakamoto studies how industry is adjusting to the painful realities of
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE are quick to embrace catchy foreign words to describe trends at
home.
The latest in their adopted lexicon is 'restra,' or restructuring, as
company after company has launched programmes to reorganise its business
operations and work its way out of the current economic gloom.
After a three-year period of economic growth - the second longest period of
expansion since after World War Two - many Japanese companies had lost touch
with market realities.
The recent fate of Japan's consumer electronics and motor industries, two of
the country's most internationally competitive sectors, showthe degree to
which corporate strategy and market conditions had drifted apart.
Consumer electronics companies, from giants such as Matsushita and Sony to
the more specialised concerns such as Pioneer and Aiwa, have been caught
with few new products to stimulate demand at a time when interest in
mainstay products has slumped.
In the motor industry, both Toyota and Nissan, Japan's largest and second
largest car makers, recently started production at new state-of-the-art
factories just as the domestic market was heading in a downward spiral.
'Car manufacturers have set their investment plans on the understanding that
the economy would continue to grow but this is no longer appropriate,' says
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan.
Nissan sent shock waves through the country when it announced earlier this
year that it would close a car assembly plant in Zama, near Tokyo, and move
production to a newer facility in southern Japan.
Its decision was forced on it by the recognition that the company cannot
expect to use its capacity to build 2.5m cars in Japan to the full under the
present circumstances.
In addition to such changed circumstances in the domestic market, Japanese
companies which depend to a significant degree on exports have been severely
battered by the 13 per cent rise in the yen's value this year.
It is hardly the first time corporate Japan has had to review seriously the
way it operates and readjust costs and business structures to changed market
realities.
Many businessmen in Japan still remember vividly the painful restructuring
needed to overcome the sharp appreciation of the yen after the Group of Five
industrial nations agreed in 1985 to strengthen the Japanese currency
against the US dollar.
Through that experience, Japanese companies emerged stronger and more
competitive, establishing a reputation for being fierce and invincible.
The question being asked today is whether Japanese companies, faced with one
of the worst recessions in post-war history, a strong and rising yen and
higher costs of financing, can do the same again.
The pressures of a business environment have forced companies to reorder
their priorities. As they watch their profits dwindle in the face of the
prolonged slump, Japanese executives have begun to grapple with the need to
raise profits even if markets are not growing.
'From now on managers have to think about maintaining profits even when
revenues are not rising,' says Mr Yasuaki Takano, president of Sanyo
Electric.
To do so, companies are employing a two-pronged approach of cutting costs
and raising productivity.
The cost-cutting exercises at Japanese companies have ranged from the
conventional steps of reducing capital expenditure and R&amp;D spending, cutting
down on overtime work and restricting the hiring of new employees to the
more dramatic and controversial measures of closing facilities, such as
Nissan did, or introducing early retirement.
Fujitsu, the computer company, has said that it would reduce its workforce
by 6,000 in two years through natural attrition and voluntary transfers to
subsidiaries and affiliated companies many of which it was establishing
itself.
Early retirement programmes have also become a popular option as a socially
less disruptive way of reducing the workforce and have been introduced at
companies ranging from Alps, an electrical components manufacturer, to
Mitsui, the trading house.
A particular feature of these cost-cutting exercises is that Japanese
companies are for the first time confronting the need to slim down their
white collar, rather than blue-collar, workforce. At the same time many
companies have been reviewing their organisational structures in an attempt
to raise overall efficiency.
MATSUSHITA, which has been criticised for its poor response to defects in
its refrigerators and a financial scandal at a subsidiary, is trying to
grapple with what is known in Japan as 'the disease of the corporate giant,'
or a bloated structure.
The administrative staff had become too large and much of the work that is
done at head office is necessary only because of the size of the company,
points out Mr Jiro Aoki, general manager of the domestic sales planning
office.
Matsushita has more than 50 subsidiaries in Japan alone, some of which
compete with each other in specific product areas. 'We used to think that
this competition would lead each company to do better but it was in a way
wasteful,' Mr Aoki admits. Now, Matsushita is trying to clarify business
areas by company.
At the same time as they attempt to slim down and raise productivity in the
office, Japanese companies are cutting costs on the factory floor.
For example, NEC is working with suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment to standardise certain parts of chip manufacturing machines. The
target is to reduce the costs of manufacturing new generations of chips by
about 20 per cent.
Standardisation is also being increasingly adopted at consumer electronics
companies and car manufacturers which have found that the wide variety of
models they had been offering were a waste - of more than 200 different
types of TVs offered by makers in Japan only about 20 per cent really sold,
says Mr Aoki - and that consumers were more interested in products which
offer value for money.
As the yen has risen strongly against the dollar, equally important in their
cost-cutting exercise has been the need to move more production overseas and
to procure more components from abroad.
Japanese manufacturers still have a high level of skills that keeps their
products competitive in world markets. They have also actively developed key
products for which there are few alternative suppliers.
But to maintain that leading edge they will need a clear business strategy
that takes into consideration the changed market environment, and that is
where the dividing line between those companies that emerge stronger and
those that drift is likely to lie.
'In Japan, top management which has been with a company for 30 or 40 years,
cannot introduce real change,' says Mr Kuniyoshi Sasaki, a director at the
Japan productivity centre. Neither do most executives have enough to provide
the strong leadership that is needed in a time of crisis.
The benefits of restructuring on the bottom line will begin to filter
through in the years ahead. But unless cost-cutting goes hand in hand with a
strategy for future growth, those benefits may turn out to be short-lived.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (2): Clouds of uncertainty - The economic
outlook is not promising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese economy is still stuck. In spite of hopeful signs early in the
year that a recovery was imminent, it is still too early to say that the
economy has bottomed out from the long decline which began with the sharp
fall in land and stock prices in 1991.
This short term uncertainty about when the economy will hit the bottom is
only further clouding its medium term outlook. It seems increasingly likely
that when growth resumes it will be extremely moderate and tentative.
In the longer term, beyond the next couple of years, the strength of the
economy will depend upon Japan's capacity for further fundamental
restructuring to deliver growth. It achieved this with a vengeance in the
1970s in response to the oil shocks, by manufacturers upgrading their
product ranges and shifting from heavy to light industry.
Now Japan faces challenges of a similar magnitude - not just in the
structure of its industry but also in its markets for labour, assets and
consumer goods - if its economy once again is to grow strongly in the second
part of this decade.
The slump set off by the sharp fall in stock and land prices which began two
years ago is still with Japan. In the year to this March the economy grew by
about 0.8 per cent, the lowest rate since the oil shocks of the 1970s. In
the past few weeks forecasters have been downgrading their estimates of what
is to come this year and next.
Optimists, such as Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salmon Brothers,
the US securities house, predicts that the economy will grow by 3.2 per cent
this fiscal year to next March and by 3.4 per cent in the following year.
However, many other forecasters believe growth will be more moderate, at
closer to 2.5 per cent or less.
In the short run there is growing evidence that the slowdown in the economy
has been arrested by a huge public sector effort to prop up the economy and
prevent it falling into recession.
The main domestic source of growth has been a massive infusion of public
funds into the economy, through special pump priming packages worth more
than Y24,000bn over the past year. This has helped to fuel construction
demand and house building.
Industry is finally getting its vast stocks of unsold inventories under
control but only after sustained cuts in industrial production. Within the
next six months industrial output may start to revive thanks to this
inventory control, but the pickup is expected to be moderate.
The money supply has also begun to rise, after an unprecedented period of
contraction late last year. Meanwhile, the health of the financial sector
has improved with the surge in the stock market over the past few months,
which has taken the Nikkei away from the lows of about 17,500 it plumbed
last year to more than 21,000.
This recovery was in large part orchestrated by public pension funds buying
stocks and regulatory changes to improve the profits outlook at NTT, the
telecommunications group which accounts for a large chunk of the Tokyo stock
market's valuation.
This rise has helped to ease many of the difficulties faced by Japan's banks
which are weighed down with bad debts left behind by speculative property
lending in the late 1980s.
The stock market's rise has strengthened the banks' balance sheets and so
made it more likely that they will be able to lend enough to finance
recovery when it finally arrives.
However set against these signs of recovery are three restraints on growth.
First, consumer spending which accounts for between 55 per cent and 60 per
cent of Japanese gross domestic product, is still deeply depressed. The
reasons for this baffle economists. The labour market is weakening but it is
still tight, with official unemployment at 2.5 per cent. Inflation is
depressed, with discounting rife, so real incomes are rising. The fall in
land prices is bottoming out, which combined with the rise in the stock
market should be strengthening consumer balance sheets.
This should soon translate into less precautionary saving and high high
street spending. But a revival in consumer spending has been predicted for
many months without materialising and it is still not clear when it will
recover strongly.
Second, corporate investment, which accounts for between 15 per cent and 20
per cent of GDP is still being cut back as companies attempt to respond to
three years of declining profits by cutting costs.
Third, Japan's opportunities for exploiting external sources of growth are
being curtailed by: the rise in the value of the yen from about Y125 to the
dollar at the start of the year to about Y108; mounting pressure over
Japan's trade surplus and the recession in Europe. In spite of their rapid
growth the south east Asian economies are unlikely to provide an alternative
market in the short run, especially for more expensive, sophisticated goods.
In the longer run, the outlook for the economy will depend on a different
mix of factors. There are powerful forces working towards a resumption of
high growth in Japan. The US will maintain its pressure for Japan to run an
expansionary economic policy to stimulate demand for imports to cut the
trade surplus. Japanese manufacturing companies are busily laying the basis
for a new surge in productivity in the next few years, with ambitious
programmes to increase efficiency.
However, against these forces that will drive growth are other factors that
will constrain it. The political uncertainty may cast a shadow over the
prospects for further fiscal stimulus.
The decline in Japan's birth rate, slow growth of its working age population
and rapid ageing mean Japan could face a structural labour shortage unless
it allows greater immigration. This labour market constraint could limit
Japan's capacity for non-inflationary growth.
Japan's asset markets present another constraint. Policy makers are so
worried that the stimulus may spill over into another bout of speculation to
match the late 1980s that they want to control growth.
Meanwhile, the pressure from the US over the scale of Japan's trade surplus,
which is expected to be worth about Dollars 150bn this year, means that
there is a curb on Japan's access to foreign markets as a source of growth.
The main hope for escape from these constraints lies with reforms at home to
create conditions for more sustainable domestic demand-led growth, by
freeing consumer and retailing markets to increase the share of consumption
within the economy.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (1): This crisis is different - Pervasive
problems in Japan's financial system have culminated in the worst economic
and political difficulties for 20 years. They coincide with a profound
rethink of Japan's world role after the end of the Cold War
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN has been through a cathartic year of crisis. Consensus, stability and
long term planning are widely thought to be the hallmarks of Japanese
society, the cultural underpinnings of its economic success.
Yet the last year has shown with a vengeance that crisis and upheaval are
just powerful engines of change and innovation, forcing companies and
political parties, bureaucrats and middle managers to reassess traditional
methods and ways of thinking.
Japan has been through periods of upheaval and crisis before, largely
brought on by economic shocks delivered from the outside. In the early 1970s
the revaluation of the yen, followed by the oil shocks, forced painful
economic restructuring. In the 1980s the lowering of the US dollar placed
similar strains upon Japan's competitiveness.
There is something different about the present upheaval. Japan's economic
difficulties - it is in the midst of the most protracted downturn for 20
years - were in large part brought on by domestic factors, particularly the
weakness of the financial sectors, after the collapse of the speculative
bubble economy of soaring land and stock prices in the late 1980s. The
current downturn is not the result of a sharp shock to the international
competitiveness of Japanese manufacturing. It is the result of pervasive
problems with the country's financial system.
But it is not simply that the nature of Japan's economic difficulties differ
from past crises. The scale and scope of this upheaval differs, for its
stretches from finance and manufacturing to the political system and Japan's
foreign relations as well as reaching into Japan's social values.
The political upheavals which led to the Liberal Democratic Party losing its
overall majority in the July 18 general election for the first time in
almost 40 years - and the consequent decision of Prime Minister Miyazawa to
resign - are just the latest and the most dramatic example of changes which
are underway in almost every area of Japanese society.
If there is one explanation for this complex, uncertain process of change it
is that Japan is maturing. It is, in fits and starts, at times reluctantly,
shedding an image of itself as a society which has to be dedicated to
economic development as a priority and which could afford to do so because
it sheltered beneath the wing of US foreign policy.
It will in future focus less on quantitative goals for economic growth as
the guiding beacon for social and commercial life. Coalitions which held
together during the period of rapid growth after the second world war are
now becoming unglued. There is a growing recognition that Japan should play
a larger world role, in part because it cannot avoid doing so as a major
economic power in a post cold war world.
To European and US ears it may sound odd to say that Japan is in crisis.
Unemployment is still low, at 2.5 per cent. The economy has not slipped into
outright recession unlike the recent experience of the UK, Germany and the
US. Japan is running a record current account surplus with its trading
partners which could be worth Dollars 150bn this year.
Yet crisis is the right term, because old assumptions and certainties are
being overturned, and tried and tested precedents which have guided Japanese
policy are being found wanting. Myths are being exposed in five areas:
Finance. The Japanese financial system is facing probably its most serious
and protracted crisis since the 1930s. The country's main banks are carrying
a heavy burden of bad debts left behind by the excessive property lending in
the late 1980s.
In past recessions the financial system has been stable while manufacturing
companies have adjusted to threats to their international competitiveness.
Now the financial system itself is being forced to restructure and reform.
The worst of the crisis is probably over. But it will take several years
before the backlog of bad debts is fully cleared up.
Industry. Manufacturing companies are embarking on long term restructuring
plans to enhance their competitiveness. These will involve greater
investment abroad, especially into south east Asia. But most manufacturers
are determined to maintain a solid core of operations in Japan despite its
relatively high costs. To achieve this they are implementing far reaching
changes in the way they design and make products to improve efficiency.
In the car and electronics industries, which have been the engines of the
growth of the Japanese economy over the past two decades, the situation is
particularly troubling. Consumer electronics and computer companies say they
are facing a 'new product recession', because they are facing for the first
time in their lives very low growth in consumer demand and chronically
depressed prices.
Foreign relations. Japan's foreign policy is being reshaped by the end of
the cold war. Japan's old foreign policies - the right's adherence to US
leadership and the left's pacifist opposition to it - are being challenged
by a new realism, underpinned by a muted Japanese nationalism. The young new
realists want Japan to play a larger world role, commensurate with its
economic power. One of the first signs of this new assertiveness, especially
evident among younger bureaucrats and managers, was the stiff Japanese
opposition to US demands for numerical targets to open up the Japanese
market to foreign goods and to cut the trade surplus.
Over the next few years, with its sights on a seat as a permanent member of
the UN security council, Japan will be charting its way cautiously into a
more independent international role.
For 40 years since the second world war Japan has relied upon US leadership
to guide it diplomatically. In the next decade it will rely less on the US.
Social change. In the past two years the salarymen and women who make up
most of the Japanese workforce have seen some of their cherished myths
evaporate. For most of the post war era Japan's scarce land has been one of
its safest investments for Japanese savers. Yet in the past two years land
has fallen in value by about 30 per cent in the wake of the collapse of the
economic bubble.
This year there has been another shock as many large companies such as
Nissan, Matsushita and NTT have announced plans to cut their workforce,
throwing in doubt their commitment to a fully fledged lifetime employment
system which is widely thought to be one of the hallmarks of management of
large companies.
These cuts are modest compared with the restructuring underway in German
industry, yet for Japanese workers brought up on on a diet of security and
loyalty they have been a shock.
Politics. The precise outcome of Japan's political turmoil is far from
clear. Yet it is clear that a fundamental process of political change is
underway.
The socialist opposition has been deeply wounded and is unlikely to recover
from the setbacks it suffered in the general election. The LDP may face a
period in which it can only exert its influence through coalitions. Young
reformers in new conservative parties are setting the pace for Japanese
politics. As a result political reforms, probably including far-reaching
reforms to electoral system, are almost certain.
The centre of gravity of the entire political system is shifting, in a
belated response to the economic and social changes which have swept Japan
as it has become perhaps the strongest economy in the post-cold-war world.
The old dividing line between left and right is increasingly irrelevant. For
the foreseeable future the most important divide in Japanese politics, which
will cut across the main parties, will be between modernisers and
traditionalists.
Supporters of political reform are spread through all parties. Elderly
defenders of the status quo congregate in both the LDP and the SDP.
Reformers in different parties often have more in common with one another
than with their seniors within their own party.
The rise of the new conservative parties - the Japan Renewal Party, the
Japan New Party and the New Harbinger Party - is the most visible sign of
this shift. But across the political system the balance of power is swinging
in favour of modernisers.
The divide between young and old will be enduring and could provide fertile
soil in which the modernising conservative parties will take root.
It is too early to say what will emerge from this period of modernisation,
partly because it will wholeheartedly embrace large tracts of tradition.
Japan's financial and industrial sectors will probably emerge yet more
competitive in a few years time. Its political institutions and social life
may become more open and transparent. Japan may become gradually more
assertive and independent in the world, particularly as far as Asia is
concerned.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Mercury prompts price war in mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited mobile telephone price war came closer yesterday with the
unveiling of tariffs by Mercury One-2-One, the new cellular mobile network
due to be launched in the M25 area soon.
One-2-One, a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, and
US West, will charge only two thirds of the price levied by existing
operators for peak-rate calls made from phones on its new digital network.
The discount on charges for calls to phones on the One-2-One network is
likely to be still larger, and initial connection charges will also be
significantly lower.
One-2-One will charge 16p a minute for calls from its mobile phones at peak
rate, with an initial connection charge for business subscribers of Pounds
20 and a monthly subscription of Pounds 20.
Vodafone, the leading mobile operator, charges 25p a minute at peak rate for
its existing analogue business service, which has national coverage. The
initial charge is Pounds 50 and the monthly charge Pounds 25.
Those charges already represent a significant reduction from a pre-June
Vodafone tariff of 33p a minute for calls in the M25 area. The price cut was
in anticipation of One-2-One's tariffs.
Vodafone is launching its own 'MetroDigital' local digital service this
autumn. Its tariffs will be lower than those for the existing network, but
with a Pounds 50 connection charge and a 20p per minute peak-rate tariff it
will still be more expensive than One-2-One.
Cellnet, the other operator, has yet to announce revised tariffs, but
indicated last week that reductions were on the way.
One-2-One has nearly completed its customer trials and the launch of its
network is imminent. It plans to expand beyond the M25 to cover about 13m
people in the south-east by the middle of next year.
Handsets for use on the One-2-One network will retail for between Pounds 250
and Pounds 300, compared with about Pounds 399 for handsets compatible with
the MetroDigital network.
One-2-One will offer a special tariff for low users, who will have a reduced
monthly subscription of Pounds 12.50 but pay 25p a minute for peak-rate
calls.
Facilities with the One-2-One service include itemised billing, call
barring, call waiting, call divert, and voice mail.
Among new cost-control features is a monthly call limit allowing customers -
or their managers - to set a ceiling on permitted expenditure.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Blueprint will need costly definition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the reasons traditionally given for Britain's failure to recognise
the right to privacy in law was that it was impossible to define.
The 1970 Younger committee on privacy concluded that the word could not
satisfactorily be defined and decided to abandon the attempt to find a
single and comprehensive definition. Similarly, the Calcutt committee said:
'Nowhere have we found a wholly satisfactory statutory definition.'
The green paper adopts the generally accepted view recognised by Younger
that privacy has two basic elements - physical seclusion and personal
information about a person's private life - and that they are infringed by
intrusion and the acquisition or publication of information.
The simple solution to deciding when privacy had been invaded would be to
define privacy in a broad way and then list different infringements.
This approach was favoured to an extent by Calcutt and has been adopted in
Canada, where the statutes do not define privacy beyond saying that the
nature and degree of privacy which a person has is that which is reasonable
in the circumstances, and then list examples of infringements.
The government's view is that this approach is too imprecise and would lead
to uncertainty. It has opted for a tighter definition, concentrating on the
core aspects of privacy - a person's health, personal communications, family
and personal relationships, and a right to be free from harassment and
molestation. The government feels this will cut down on the need for the
press and the media to plead defences.
Nevertheless, many lawyers feel that uncertainty about what is and what is
not an invasion of privacy is bound to arise, particularly until a body of
case law has built up.
The public-interest defence in particular might pose considerable problems
where celebrities claim their privacy has been invaded. The traditional view
is that the right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter
which is of public and general interest.
If that is maintained, how could public figures argue that their private
lives are not of public interest, particularly as on some occasions they
actively court publicity? Each case will differ, making precedents difficult
to establish.
Lengthy court battles are predicted which may go up to the House of Lords.
The cost of such litigation would far outstrip the maximum Pounds 10,000
damages envisaged, making the risk of losing an action for infringement of
privacy too great even for the very well-heeled.
With no legal aid for privacy actions, few individuals would be able to
afford to fight a newspaper or television company which put up a defence.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Councils cannot 'opt in' to review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO allow councils to 'opt in' to the review of local government in
England have been vetoed by Mr John Major, Alison Smith writes.
The proposal from Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to allow councils
to vote in favour of inclusion in the review, was among suggestions for
overhauling the reorganisation of local government.
Today's Local Government Chronicle says the prime minister rejected the idea
of making the review voluntary last week. An announcement on the revision is
not now expected until September.
Mr Major's main reason, it says, was that making later stages of the review
optional would encourage Scottish and Welsh councils to try to avoid being
reviewed. Legislation on Scottish and Welsh local government is due to come
forward in November.
The environment department wants to speed up the review so that it does not
last the scheduled three more years.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Government aims to slam door on invasions of privacy: Green
paper draws on European code - Lengthy court battles predicted / Public
interest to be a defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no right to privacy in English or Scots law, as former cabinet
ministers, stars of television's ''Allo 'Allo' and members of the royal
family can testify.
The green paper on infringement of privacy published yesterday canvasses the
idea of a new civil action giving individuals the right to sue anyone for
damages who causes them distress by invading their privacy.
Three years ago a committee chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC concluded that
there was no overwhelming case for introducing such a cause of action.
It considered, largely on principle and the availability of other options
for protecting privacy, that stronger self-regulation by the press with the
introduction of criminal offences to cover three forms of physical intrusion
would suffice.
Asked two years later to consider whether self-regulation had worked, Sir
David concluded that it had not and that the government should consider a
new civil action for infringement of privacy.
Yet in the intervening years there was no obvious increase in public concern
about privacy.
Between January 1991 and July 1992 the Press Complaints Commission received
211 complaints on privacy including those concerning harassment and
intrusion into grief or shock. Of those 109 were admissible and few went to
full adjudication.
The Broadcasting Complaints Commission receives only one or two cases a year
relating to privacy.
Even the green paper acknowledges that if a new civil action were created
the total volume of cases reaching the courts under a general privacy law
'would probably be in the hundreds rather than the thousands'.
The protections of privacy which Calcutt considered sufficient in 1990 are
still in place. Seclusion can be protected by trespass and nuisance laws.
Personal information can be protected by the laws of breach of confidence,
copyright and contract, and private life by laws on defamation and malicious
falsehood.
The criminal law gives some protection from harassment and physical
intrusions, for example under the Interception of Communications Act. In
family life domestic violence laws protect spouses and partners from
molestation.
In recommending the creation of a civil action for infringement of privacy
the government appears to have been swayed as much as anything by the
express protection accorded to privacy in most other European countries and
by the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides that 'everyone
has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his
correspondence'.
The French civil code provides that every person has the right to respect
for his private life. The right applies only to individuals and not
companies, but covers not only invasions of privacy by the press but also by
banks, insurance companies, credit agencies and central and local
government. French courts can award damages and make orders preventing
publication of material which breaches the right of privacy.
In Germany the civil code provides a right of action for damages against a
person who 'wilfully or negligently injures the life, body, health, freedom,
property or other right of another, contrary to the law . . .'
In the US most states have statutes or a body of case law protecting
privacy, including both criminal offences and civil actions. In Canada
several provinces have privacy acts making wilful violation of privacy
actionable.
The green paper proposes the creation of a civil cause of action in England,
Wales and Scotland for individuals in respect of conduct which constitutes
an infringement of privacy causing substantial distress, provided that 'such
distress would also have been suffered by a person of ordinary sensibilities
in the circumstances of the complainant'.
Privacy would cover a person's health, personal communications and family
and personal relationships and a right to be free from harassment and
molestation.
The green paper asks whether publication of inaccurate or misleading
information or of information 'putting a person in a false light' should be
included as a category, and whether it would be appropriate for legislation
to include 'appropriation of a person's identity'.
The government does not intend to make someone who infringes another's
privacy strictly liable. It proposes that a defendant be liable only if the
infringement was intentional, reckless or negligent.
The green paper proposes several defences: consent, both express and
implied; absolute or qualified privilege equivalent to that in defamation
cases; and a public-interest defence. It also canvasses the idea that there
should be a defence of necessary protection, such as the employment of a
private investigator to check on errant spouses or employees suspected of
industrial espionage.
The government is also seeking comments on whether it should be a defence
that the matters in issue were the subject of public record or took place in
public.
The paper proposes that plaintiffs should be able to obtain an injunction
preventing publication of material which would result in an infringement of
privacy. The usual maximum level of damages would be Pounds 10,000, with
awards of up to Pounds 25,000 in exceptional cases. As with defamation there
would be no legal aid available.
The government is seeking comments by mid-October.

A WORKER who witnessed the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster from a rescue vessel
was not entitled to claim damages for the psychiatric injury he suffered,
the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday.
Three judges overturned a High Court ruling that Mr Francis McFarlane, a

THE administrators of Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf, the office development in
London's Docklands, have won High Court approval to put together an
arrangement that could take the project out of administration.
The significance of the move was played down by the administrators, who said
it was 'merely a technical stage in the administration process'. It will
allow them to put formal proposals to the project's creditors, if and when
such proposals are developed.
The administrators, from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, have won
permission to put together either a company voluntary arrangement, which
involves an informal scheme of compromise by creditors, or a scheme of
arrangement, a more formal route out of administration.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Venables given deadline on costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH COURT yesterday gave Mr Terry Venables three weeks to put up Pounds
300,000 'security for costs' as a condition of being allowed to proceed with
his legal attempt to seize control of Tottenham Hotspur from chairman Mr
Alan Sugar.
If Mr Venables fails to pay the money by August 19 his pending plea for the
right to buy out Mr Sugar's shareholding will be halted. Continued failure
to pay after that deadline would allow Mr Sugar's lawyers to apply to have
the action dismissed.
Yesterday's order was won by Mr Sugar, his holding company Amshold and
Tottenham Hotspur, who claimed that the financial state of Edennote, Mr
Venables's company, was such that it would not be able to meet their costs
in the event of their winning the case.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 50 cases of attempted or successful fraud involving about Pounds
1m in the Court Funds Office were uncovered between 1988 and 1992, a report
by the National Audit Office yesterday says.
The Court Funds Office, part of the Public Trust Office, administers and
manages funds deposited in the courts on behalf of minors and mental
patients and by suitors in litigation.
Systems and procedures have been reviewed and strengthened but because of
the complexity of the work and inability to identify the culprits 'there
remain some continuing unavoidable risks and concerns', the report says.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Finance shake-up at Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREAS Whittam Smith yesterday announced he is stepping down as chief
executive of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and
Independent on Sunday, after nearly six years.
He has combined the jobs of editor of The Independent and chief executive
since early in the life of the publication.
A financial restructuring, which will probably involve a rights issue, is
planned when a new chief executive is in place.
'I have come to the conclusion that doing both jobs is bad for the company
and bad for me,' Mr Whittam Smith said yesterday.
Mr Ian Hay Davidson, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, said the
restructuring would almost certainly lead to a change in the balance of the
company's shareholdings.
Two European newspaper groups - El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy
 -are the largest shareholders, each with 18 per cent. Both have indicated
their willingness to go to 50 per cent each.
While not ruling this out Mr Whittam Smith yesterday emphasised that he was
seeking 'a plurality of shareholders'.
Before extra cash is raised the company will draw down around Pounds 3m from
its overdraft facility - Pounds 1.5m for each title - to fund immediate
developments.
Existing cash, cost-cuttings and cash flow are likely to take the money
available to between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m although the company would not
confirm the exact figure.
The money will be used to introduce colour printing on both titles and pay
for new sections and for promotion.
These decisions come at a time of falling sales and the failure of the
company's attempt to buy the Observer.
Apart from editing The Independent Mr Whittam Smith will 'keep an eye on'
the Independent on Sunday as group editor-in-chief.
Mr Ian Jack will continue to edit the Sunday paper and Mr Whittam Smith's
fellow founder Mr Matthew Symmonds will remain executive editor of the
daily. Mr Whittam Smith will become deputy chairman of Newspaper Publishing.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Nadir affair threatens to draw Lyell back in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NICHOLAS Lyell, the attorney-general, may be drawn again into the Asil
Nadir affair over the case of a senior Inland Revenue investigator arrested
on Wednesday by police probing alleged corruption.
This emerged yesterday as Turkish Cypriot officials said they had given the
UK's Serious Fraud Office bank documents relating to Mr Nadir, the fugitive
tycoon who jumped bail and fled to the island in early May.
However, the Turkish Cypriot authorities yesterday ruled out extraditing Mr
Nadir to Britain. Mr Kenan Atakol, foreign minister, said the move was 'out
of the question', but added: 'If the Serious Fraud Office representatives
wish to see us, we will consider their request to see us.' Britain does not
recognise the Turkish Cypriot-controlled territory and no extradition treaty
exists.
Lawyers acting for the Revenue investigator, Mr Michael Allcock, said
yesterday that their client, who was released without charge on police bail
pending further investigations, could face prosecution under the Corruption
Act 1906.
The act refers to bribery cases. Evidence gathered under the act must be
referred to the attorney-general to decide whether a prosecution should take
place.
Sir Nicholas was embroiled in controversy last month after Mr Michael Mates,
the former Northern Ireland minister, alleged 'improper collusion' between
the Revenue and the SFO.
Mr Allcock was suspended in September last year as head of the Revenue's
Special Office 2, which investigates cases of large-scale tax evasion or
avoidance, particularly by foreign residents. He claims to have passed
information about Mr Nadir's financial affairs to the Stock Exchange during
the 1980s.
Fraud squad detectives took documents and correspondence when they arrested
Mr Allcock and his wife Sally at their home in Colchester, Essex at about
6.30 on Wednesday morning. Mrs Allcock was arrested on suspicion of
perverting the course of justice.
A third person, believed to be an Iraqi businessman who had been the subject
of an investigation by the Inland Revenue, was arrested at an address in
central London at about the same time.
Speaking from his home yesterday Mr Allcock said he denied all allegations
of bribery or corruption: 'I'm going to fight it every step of the way.'
In northern Cyprus Mr Haki Onen, the island territory's deputy
attorney-general, said five pages of documents relating to cash positions of
the local subsidiaries of Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's former
company, had been given to Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO case officer in charge
of the Nadir investigation. Mr Onen said the documents were provided on
request from the SFO.
Local officials say the documents relate to the Pounds 140m which Mr Nadir
claimed was held on deposit on September 30 1990 at banks including the
Cyprus Industrial Bank, his privately owned bank.
The SFO said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with the progress its officials
had made in northern Cyprus this week. Yesterday Mr Onen said an
investigation had established that some of the bank documents had been
forged. He added that there was no evidence that Mr Nadir was involved. The
document purports to show that on October 8 1990, just before the group went
into administration, the bank was holding a cash deposit of Pounds 39.7m.
Mr Nadir's wardrobe, including 150 suits, 200 silk shirts and 480 silk ties,
is being auctioned by trustees of his estate to help clear his debts.

THE SATELLITE business of British Telecommunications would be subject to

Under Oftel's plans BT would have to publish a financial statement covering

FT  30 JUL 93 / Welcome for rules which will 'drag tabloids out of gutter'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM KING and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS CLARE Short, the MP whose complaint to the Press Complaints Commission
was upheld in 1991 after the News of the World published a photograph of her
in her nightdress, welcomed the proposals and said the press would not have
'trawled' through her private life had they been law. 'It will drag the
tabloid press out of the gutter,' she said.
Her sentiments were typical of people who have had run-ins with the press
and pursued their grievances through existing arrangements.
Mrs Linda Townley is suing Today newspaper for malicious falsehood after it
alleged in 1989 that she stole letters from Princess Anne while in her
employment. Mrs Townley said she probably would have used the proposed
privacy law if it had existed.
Mrs Diane Simpson, a researcher, was photographed talking to Mr Peter
Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, by someone who gained access to Broadmoor
hospital by subterfuge.
She said the proposed legislation would have protected patients. But she
agreed that intrusions into privacy could sometimes be in the public
interest.
Others felt that the proposals - which do not provide for legal aid - did
not offer enough protection.
Ms Mona Alghussein, then known as Mrs Mona Bauwens, became the subject of
press interest because of gifts she made to Mr David Mellor, the former
heritage secretary.
She said she was more concerned about accuracy than privacy, 'though there
were certain aspects of my private life that I didn't think were anyone's
interest'. The proposed legislation was no use without legal aid, she said.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Lloyd's attacks rival proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has written to all of its 20,000-plus Names condemning an
alternative business plan as 'fundamentally flawed'.
The plan, drawn up by Mr David Springbett, a Lloyd's broker, proposes that
new corporate investors pay a portion of future profits to compensate
loss-making Names, the individuals whose assets support the market.
In the letter Lloyd's says the plan's aim to attract new capital amounts to
'wishful thinking' and will 'drive new members away'.
Mr Springbett has advised Names to vote against a motion supporting the
existing Lloyd's management in a ballot currently under way. The result is
due on 10 August.
Meanwhile, 372 Names taking legal action against the managers of Pulbrook
syndicate have been told the case will be heard in December.
Separately, Lloyd's has claimed victory in another US court case involving
pollution.
The New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed two lower court decisions in favour
of insurers in a case involving Morton International, which sued its
insurers for recovery of contamination clean-up costs at Berry's Creek in
New Jersey. Costs of the clean-up were estimated at Dollars 100m (Pounds
67.1m). Insurers provided coverage between 1960 and 1975.
The DTI has published long-awaited proposals allowing UK insurers to
establish equalisation reserves.
If the proposals are adopted US insurers will be able to set aside part of
their non-life profits from good years to meet losses suffered in bad ones.
Tax relief will be claimed on the amounts transferred.

FT  30 JUL 93 / EOC to probe sex bias claim from men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUAL Opportunities Commission will launch its first formal
investigation into the practices of an employment agency, following
allegations by men that one agency refused to give them 'women's' jobs.
The formal investigation into Halifax-based Workforce Employment Agency,
which has branches in Leeds and Bradford, West Yorkshire, was announced by
the EOC yesterday.
The commission said it had received complaints from men alleging they had
been refused jobs as packers. It was claimed the jobs were advertised as
being in 'a predominantly female environment'.
The EOC said it 'has reason to believe that the agency may be reserving jobs
by sex so that women are also being disadvantaged. There are 14,701 agencies
licensed by the Department of Employment. Any findings in this case may have
an effect on other agencies. All agencies should operate and be seen to
operate without regard to sex in all their activities.'
The commission's annual report for 1992 disclosed that, for the first time,
men were forming a large proportion of those claiming that companies were
discriminating in their hiring policies. Of 1,253 complaints to the EOC, 40
per cent were from men.
The investigation could take up to a year.
In cases where the EOC finds discrimination has taken place, it can issue a
notice telling the company to stop discriminating and then monitor
activities for the next five years.
The company refused to comment.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Piper Alpha claim is overturned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WORKER who witnessed the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster from a rescue vessel
was not entitled to claim damages for the psychiatric injury he suffered,
the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday.
Three judges overturned a High Court ruling that Mr Francis McFarlane, a
painter from Alloa, near Stirling, could claim because he had been in fear
for his life and safety and the fear had caused the shock which led to his
injury.
Mrs Justice Smith ruled last December that Mr McFarlane was a primary victim
of the disaster because of his closeness to it. He had completed his shift
aboard the platform and returned to his quarters on the Tharos, which was
involved in the rescue operations.
She held that Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) - now EE Caledonia - the
owner and operator of Piper Alpha, had owed Mr McFarlane a 'duty of care'
and was therefore liable. But Lord Justice Ralph Gibson, sitting with Lords
Justices Stuart-Smith and McCowan, ruled she had erred.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Tougher regulation of BT satellite business urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SATELLITE business of British Telecommunications would be subject to
more detailed regulation under proposals published yesterday by Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator.
Under Oftel's plans, BT would have to publish a financial statement covering
the activities of the division, which is responsible for selling satellite
capacity to rival operators.
BT would be barred from seeking investment contributions from other
operators.
The move marks a further extension of regulatory pressure by Oftel, coming
after a series of recent proposals to make the company more open to its
competitors.
The review of existing arrangements between BT and other companies offering
satellite links concerns the provision of satellite capacity with Intelsat
and Eutelsat - satellites funded and operated by consortia of state
telecommunications companies.
Three years ago BT established a 'signatory affairs office' to give
independent satellite service operators access to capacity.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'The proposed changes will
help create the right conditions for greater competition in the UK satellite
service market, which will mean a wider range of innovative and keenly
priced services being made available to customers.'
He said the new arrangements would give competitors 'confidence' in the
signatory affairs office, 'although as the satellite consortia move towards
direct access for capacity the role of the SAO will naturally diminish'.
BT welcomed the plans but said it needed to consider the implications of
some of the regulatory proposals.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Welsh 'Quangoland' warned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, warned chairmen of Welsh quangos
yesterday that the public expected national boards to maintain the 'highest
standards of probity and fairness'. He said: 'I look to all the chairmen to
lead, by insisting on the highest standards of conduct.'
He said if things did go wrong, or a mistake was made, 'the public likes an
early apology from the board and is entitled to expect that disciplinary
action will be taken if necessary'.
Mr Redwood was speaking at a meeting with the chairmen of Welsh
non-departmental public bodies - the so-called quangos. He said there were
limits to the number of functions which could best be handled by these.
'Many services require either the direct political control and
accountability of local government or the Welsh Office. I do not want
Quangoland to grow too fat on functions transferred from local government.'
His comments come a few weeks after the publication of a highly critical
report by the Commons public accounts committee about the internal
management of the Welsh Development Agency.
The investigation followed concerns raised by the National Audit Office
about the WDA's 1991-92 accounts.
In a report published today, the NAO condemns the way in which another
quango, the Development Board for Rural Wales, allocated housing under a
secret set of rules separate to those which were made public.
The board's own housing officer was involved in allocating houses to himself
and his ex-wife when neither was eligible under the published rules. The
board said both allocations were authorised by senior officers.
In his report on the board's 1992-93 accounts, Sir John Bourn, head of the
NAO, said the total number of affected tenancies was not known but might be
one fifth of the board's housing stock of 1,200 houses, which are mostly in
Newtown, Powys.
His report follows one earlier this year by Mr Elwyn Moseley, the Welsh
ombudsman, who found there had been gross maladministration. Sir John said
the board accepted it had been guilty of that and had stopped allocations
under the unpublished categories.
It is the third successive year that the NAO has commented on the board's
accounts. Last year, it said the board in 1991-92 had modified a car leasing
scheme without Welsh Office approval. The previous year there had been an
irregular payment of Pounds 15,563 to its retiring chief executive.
Under the published housing rules, a qualifying applicant must have secured
permanent employment in the town where he or she wished to live and to come
from outside a 10-mile radius of it. Under the unpublished categories,
neither employment in the area nor residence outside was a requirement.
Sir John recognised that the board had been seeking to make best use of its
assets and to meet its wider development objectives.
Mr Glyn Davies, the board's chairman and an ex-officio director of the WDA,
said yesterday: 'Sir John's report is fair and balanced. But it is very
frustrating that media attention is diverted from the good work that we do.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Talks prompted Swan Hunter to lift its offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NAO report seeks to explain one of the most puzzling episodes in modern
defence procurement history - how two shipyards, both UK-based, could come
up with bids for the same vessel which were Pounds 71m apart.
The report discloses that the MoD 'reminded' Swan Hunter early this year
that it would consider giving it the helicopter carrier order if it were
taken over by a more financially secure company, able to provide the
required guarantee of due performance.
At that time Swans was negotiating a takeover by GEC. Ironically, it was
advice from GEC-Marconi, which Swans concurred with and the MoD assessed as
realistic, which added Pounds 12.2m for increased overheads to Swans final
bid. While VSEL's bid dropped, from Pounds 165m to Pounds 139.5m, Swan's
rose from Pounds 174.5m to Pounds 210.6m.
The report says that the MoD's evaluation of the two initial bids, implied
lower overhead rates for both than would have been expected. Nevertheless
the department concluded that 'the tendered prices could be considered to be
realistic'.
Neither bid was fully technically compliant at that stage. No 'bottom-line'
comparison of the merits of the two bids was made.
The department's main financial analysis of the reasonableness of the best
and final offer bids was limited to a subjective review. Because of the
compressed timescale it relied on a 'senior management brainstorm' to
identify key risks.
It concluded the lower VSEL bid represented an acceptable price.
Swan Hunter's bid, MoD technical experts concluded in a detailed review
after the contract award, was 'realistic but unaffordable'.

FT  30 JUL 93 / VSEL subsidised Navy ship bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL Shipbuilding subsidised its winning bid for a Royal Navy ship in a
competition against Swan Hunter, a government report said yesterday.
But the Ministry of Defence was right to give the contract to VSEL because
the price gap between the two bids was much bigger than the subsidy, says
the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog.
Tyneside's Swan Hunter final bid of Pounds 210.6m to build the ship, a
helicopter carrier, was Pounds 71m more than VSEL's final bid of Pounds
139.5m and Swans called in the receiver when it failed to win the contract.
The NAO says the MoD estimated the level of VSEL's support at Pounds 25m to
Pounds 30m on its final bid. But after the publication of the report sources
close to the Barrow-in-Furness company said that the true figure was a
little more than Pounds 10m.
Mr Noel Davies, VSEL's chief executive, said: 'We have recovered all our
variable overheads and have made a contribution to fixed overheads. It's a
contract which is better to have than not to have.'
The report also contradicts allegations by politicians that the MoD had
unfairly favoured VSEL. It says the MoD 'treated both tenderers in a fair
and even-handed manner'.
Much of the Pounds 71m difference in the bids was the result of lower
overheads at VSEL's civilian subcontractor, Kvaerner Govan on Scotland's
River Clyde, it says.
However, the NAO warns the MoD that if Swan Hunter closed, VSEL might have a
monopoly over some types of shipbuilding.
Mr Roger Vaughan, former joint chief executive of Swan Hunter, said:
'(Creating a monopoly) is not an approach to the defence manufacturing
industry which is likely to lead to the maintenance of a defence
manufacturing base.'
Mr Alex Marsh, also former joint chief executive, said Swan Hunter had
understood that the MoD's budget was about Pounds 170m. He declined to
comment on why, given this, the company thought a Pounds 210m bid might be
acceptable.
The report says the MoD was aware VSEL might become a monopoly supplier of
large warships if Swans closed but it thought savings from competition in
the bid more than outweighed the cost of keeping a high level of
competition.
'Overall, the MoD concluded that these problems could only be addressed in
the context of individual procurements and not as part of an abstract wider
strategy,' the report says.
The NAO identifies potential risks on the programme and lessons for the
future:
The MoD, aware that Swan Hunter faced receivership if the award of the
contract were delayed, accelerated its timescale and changed its approach.
This risked failing to identify the most cost-effective solution, although
the department believed this risk was outweighed by the benefits of ensuring
effective competition.
Because of the short timescales for bids, the MoD was unable to carry out a
full life-cycle cost assessment of the two bids. 'This has led to the
department carrying the . . . financial risk that the vessel could be more
expensive to operate than originally envisaged,' warns the report.
The MoD's arrangements for merchant classification of the vessel, although
refined during the course of competition, were not clearly spelt out in its
initial contract documentation, leaving some risk.
The NAO says: 'If the department are to continue procuring vessels which
embody a mixture of commercial and military standards some consideration
might be given to improving the expertise of the department's staff in
connection with commercial standards.'
The MoD's approach to availability, reliability and maintenance meant that
it, rather than industry, bore the risk of achieving what it needed.
While the department successfully transferred most of the financial risk to
VSEL, through use of a fixed price, there remained a risk the total cost
could rise if changes to specifications were not tightly controlled.
The MoD also recognised, it adds, that it must monitor progress closely to
obtain delivery of a vessel which met its specification on time and within
the fixed price.
The NAO says the bidding process was dealt with fairly but suggests informal
meetings between the MoD and bidders should be avoided, and all meetings
tape recorded.
It also describes as 'disturbing' the fact that both tenderers obtained
unofficial information on the budgetary provision; the decision not to
provide this information was a key part of the MoD's procurement strategy.

FT  30 JUL 93 / MPs rap DTI over Girobank sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS public accounts committee has criticised the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Post Office over the 1990 sale of state-owned Girobank
for Pounds 63m less than the book value of its assets.
The Post Office is also castigated for not seeking further bidders for
Giroleasing, Girobank's corporate leasing and hire-purchasing business,
which was sold to Norwich Union. A Pounds 378m offer by Norwich Union was
found to be overstated by Pounds 55m 'through a genuine mistake' the day
before the sale.
In a report published yesterday the committee suggests that the Co-operative
Wholesale Society might have been prepared to pay more for Girobank than the
Pounds 130m obtained from the Alliance and Leicester Building Society.
The committee said it had not been established that a Pounds 124m bid by the
CWS was a final offer. The MPs say it would have been advantageous for the
taxpayer if, when the field was reduced to two bidders, both had been given
preferential status, not just Alliance and Leicester.
The committee says the overstatement by Pounds 55m of the value of the
Pounds 378m bid for Giroleasing arose from errors in detailed tax
calculations. 'The corrected Norwich Union offer had a value of Pounds 323m,
which meant that another company, whose offer was for Pounds 342m, was now
offering more'.
It says that the Post Office gave Norwich Union less than a week to revise
its bid and agreed not to solicit other bids.
It concludes: 'By committing itself not to solicit other bids . . . the Post
Office denied itself the opportunity to explore what other bidders might
have been prepared to offer.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Clarke counts his meagre blessings: The options for the
chancellor as he meets officials at Dorneywood today to ponder his Budget
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE FACE of it the economic situation is much clearer today than it was
in January, when Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, brought Treasury
ministers and officials together to discuss preliminary plans for the March
Budget.
Then the one certainty was that public-sector finances needed to be brought
under control. Economic recovery had yet to make itself known.
Eight months on Mr Lamont's successor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has the blessing
of several months of promising economic data showing the economy growing
faster than Treasury predictions of 1.25 per cent for this year.
But he and his officials, meeting today at Dorneywood, his official country
residence in Buckinghamshire, may find it no less difficult to decide on an
appropriate course of action for the November 30 Budget.
Not only does Mr Clarke have to consider the impact of his decisions on his
party's volatile backbenchers, but doubts about the apparent strength of the
recovery have emerged again.
Although figures for retail sales, manufacturing output and unemployment
suggest a steady, and moderately strong, recovery, there is a degree of
scepticism about the story being told by the figures. Wariness among
economists about the recovery was reinforced this week by a Confederation of
British Industry survey of manufacturers which showed exports to Europe
tailing off.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'There is
a sense in which the general mood is not as buoyant as official data would
have you believe. I don't think it is right to conclude that the economy is
recovering strongly. The pace of recovery is slowing and that looks likely
to continue for the rest of the year.'
By November Mr Clarke will have a better idea of whether fears about the
recovery are well-founded. In the meantime many City economists are urging
him and his officials to favour a policy mix of tax increases and public
spending cuts to bring down the public sector borrowing requirement, with
interest rate cuts to ensure that exports are not jeopardised by a strong
pound.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'I can't think
of a better time to get the PSBR down on an underlying basis and cut rates
to help exports. This would meet economic and political objectives, with the
rate cuts sweetening the political pill of tax increases.'
The problem with this scenario is that with such a small government majority
Mr Clarke cannot afford to upset Tory backbenchers with politically
sensitive tax increases.
If he does raise taxes, he is more likely to tinker with allowances than
touch basic rates of income tax. Extending value added tax is also a
politically dangerous option, after the outcry by Tory backbenchers that
followed what they saw as Mr Lamont's unfair decision to levy VAT on
domestic fuel.
There is also a risk that tax increases will stifle the recovery. Professor
Wynne Godley of Cambridge University said: 'It cannot be right to put up
taxes when there is a faltering recovery from the recession.'
The scenario of raising taxes while cutting interest rates may not be
favoured by Mr Clarke for another reason. Although the Treasury does not
have a target for the exchange rate, the prevailing view of the Treasury and
the Bank of England is that it should not be allowed to sink too far for
fear of importing inflation.
Mr Bootle said: 'The dominant philosophy of the Treasury is that the
exchange rate should be used as an anti-inflation weapon, This is wrong
because it constantly weakens our export industries which then leads to
current account problems.'
Mr Clarke still has plenty of time to decide on the Budget. It may be that
the recovery fears are unfounded, leaving him with greater scope for
tackling the public-sector finances.
Mr Spencer believes that far from faltering, the recovery is becoming more
robust. 'The exceptionally long recession means that the pent-up demand for
consumer goods is also exceptionally high.'
This meant, he said, that certain processes are under way which make the
recovery self-sustaining - rising retail sales, higher incomes and falling
unemployment.
The problem for Mr Clarke is assessing the state of the economy today, and
how far it will have progressed by November.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Lib Dems launch into party time after 'stunning win'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHRISTCHURCH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats in Christchurch launched into celebrations this
morning as they triumphantly declared themselves stunned by the size of
their by-election victory. Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath,
said: 'To be achieving this against a Tory majority of 23,000 is amazing. It
shows a massive swing.'
It had taken 4 1/2 hours from the close of the polls for election officials
to count the stacks of voting papers in a crowded and stuffy local leisure
centre.
As the evening progressed, the Liberal Democrats could barely conceal their
delight. Even before the declaration they announced that their leader Mr
Paddy Ashdown would be touring the constituency in an open-top bus today.
Meanwhile the Conservatives began to assume expressions of dignified
resignation as it became clear that their candidate Mr Rob Hayward had not
held the seat.
Supporters of Labour candidate Mr Nigel Lickley were notable only by their
low profile, less visible than the groups of wacky candidates such as Lord
David Sutch or the candidate dressed in a giant chicken outfit for the
Alfred Chicken party.
After the declaration, amid rousing Liberal Democrat cheers, Ms Tara Bardot
Jackson from the Buy the Daily Sport party, dressed in an exotic rubber and
Lycra outfit, was the first of the 14 candidates to cross the stage and
congratulate the quietly triumphant Mrs Maddock.
Although the Tories had been braced for defeat the size of the swing left
many feeling stunned. Most Conservative workers cited the issue of VAT on
heating fuel as the chief cause of their defeat, although others privately
indicated that Mr Hayward was likely to become, at least partly, a
scapegoat. One local party worker said: 'He hasn't been very good at putting
himself across.'
Mr Peter Herbage, a Christchurch Conservative councillor, said: 'There's a
lot of us who feel that, if he lost in Bristol, why did they send him here?'

FT  30 JUL 93 / 'Quangoland' of Wales warned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, warned chairmen of Welsh quangos
yesterday that the public expected national boards to maintain the 'highest
standards of probity and fairness'. He said: 'I look to all the chairmen to
lead, by insisting on the highest standards of conduct.'
He said if things did go wrong 'the public likes an early apology from the
board and is entitled to expect that disciplinary action will be taken if
necessary'.
Mr Redwood told chairmen of Welsh non-departmental public bodies that there
were limits to the number of functions which could best be handled by
quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental bodies.
He added: 'Many services require either the direct political control and
accountability of local government or the Welsh Office. I do not want
Quangoland to grow too fat on functions transferred from local government.'
His comments come a few weeks after the publication of a highly critical
report by the Commons public accounts committee about the internal
management of the Welsh Development Agency.
The investigation followed concerns raised by the National Audit Office
about the WDA's 1991-92 accounts.
In a report published today, the audit office condemns the way in which
another quango, the Development Board for Rural Wales, allocated housing
under a secret set of rules separate to those which were made public.
It says the board's own housing officer was involved in allocating houses to
himself and his former wife when neither was eligible under the published
rules.

Mr Justice Hutchison said the government had not yet fully authorised the

Greenpeace had argued that the test run would allow radioactive uranium to

BARCLAYS BANK plans to challenge the Treasury over more than Pounds 1m in
lost discounts for BT3 shares, the bank said last night.
A lorry taking 12,000 application forms to the City for bank customers was
delayed by traffic jams and arrived two minutes after the offer for the
third and final tranche of British Telecommunications shares closed.
The bank has told its Share Shop customers that it will pick up the bill so
they will not lose the discount of 30p per share available to small
investors - 10p off each payment due.
But Mr Philip Ashley of Barclays said the bank would fight the Treasury over
its decision not to stretch the deadline. He said it seemed very harsh to
have the lorry-load of forms ruled out for just a couple of minutes.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Voters exact revenge for 'betrayal': Philip Stephens
explains the swing from the Tories in Christchurch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS lost before it started. The seething discontent which cost Mr John
Major his party's 15th-safest seat in the early hours of this morning was
obvious from the outset of the Christchurch by-election campaign.
Two thirds of the electors of the sleepy seaside constituency in east Dorset
voted Conservative at the general election only 15 months ago.
This week these once-loyal footsoldiers of southern Toryism were set on one
thing above all else - to exact revenge on a government that had broken its
promises.
The word heard most frequently on the doorsteps of the neat suburban
bungalows and the grander middle-class villas strung across the constituency
was 'betrayal'.
The prime minister had promised them that their support on April 9 1992
would bring economic recovery on April 10. Instead the recession had dragged
for another year. Even now they were suspicious of the evidence that the
upturn is at last a reality.
They had been told that Mr Major, like his predecessor, would cut their
taxes. Instead he had put them up - and done so in a way that which
penalised those on modest if not low incomes.
Pace Mr Norman Lamont, the imposition of value added tax on domestic heating
may yet be destined to find a place in the history books as one of the
biggest political blunders of modern times.
Those two betrayals might not have been enough of themselves to overturn the
23,000 majority bequeathed by the charming individualist, the late Robert
Adley.
But overlaying them was widespread disaffection at all the government's
policies. Mr Major was perceived as weak, his party as divided and
self-indulgent. Rising crime rates have infuriated a population with more
than its fair share of the vulnerable elderly.
Even Mr Major's promise of another burst of privatisation and deregulation
raised hackles. The voters of Christchurch do not want their local stores
driven out of business by Sunday-opening hypermarkets, their sub-post
offices sacrificed on the altar of free-market efficiency, their rail
services privatised.
The message from ministers this morning will be that this was a mid-term
protest. Governments rarely win by-elections - and never at the tail-end of
a recession.
Downing Street has already rehearsed its response. Ministers will insist
that the outcome reflected the past rather than the future. Mr Major has put
behind him the civil war over Maastricht which so gravely damaged his
political authority. The sunlit uplands of economic recovery beckon.
To an extent they are right. Few expect Mrs Diana Maddock, the studiously
dull Liberal Democrat MP, to hold the seat beyond the next general election.
Look, after all, at what happened to the victors in the last parliament of
Eastbourne, Ribble Valley, and Kincardine and Deeside.
There were special circumstances also. The peculiar make-up of the
constituency - about a third of the population are above pensionable age -
proved particularly fertile ground for opposition 'scare stories' about
plans for new NHS prescription charges and hotel fees for hospital stays.
The retired and near-retired of Christchurch - not rich but sufficiently
well-off not to qualify for state benefits - will suffer more than most the
impact of high domestic fuel charges.
But Mr Major should beware of believing his own excuses. The campaign in
Christchurch has shown how detached the government has become from its own
traditional supporters among the lower middle classes.
The prime minister is perceived as weak and ineffective even by paid-up
members of his own party. These greying classes are represent one of the
most powerful interest groups in the southern, and particularly
south-western, English constituencies that the Conservatives must win to
remain in government.
In the county council elections and in the Newbury by-election in May, and
again yesterday, they defected to the Liberal Democrats in huge numbers.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's party remains one of local rather than national politics.
But it is beginning to put down roots across a swathe of territory vital to
the Conservatives. If he is to survive, Mr Major will have to listen to the
electors of Christchurch.

more than 25,000 LPs and 23,000 singles - for Pounds 181,694 yesterday,
comfortably exceeding the Pounds 150,000 estimate.
A private collector from St Louis in the US bought it by secret tender, and
the proceeds are to go to the Terrence Higgins Trust, the Aids charity.
The records range from obscure 1950s blues singers through soul labels of
the 1970s and limited-edition Beatles albums to jazz fusion.
The same buyer paid Pounds 45,500 for John Lennon's original manuscript
lyrics for the song 'I am the Walrus'.
The main lot in the auction of rock and roll memorabilia was a recently
recovered archive of Terry Spencer's 1963-64 Beatles photographs.
The 5,000 black and white images were sold, with full copyright, for Pounds
91,700 to Bloomsbury Publishing, which plans to use them as the basis for an
illustrated book.
The Sotheby's auction totalled Pounds 441,697 and was over 83 per cent sold
by value.

Tory candidate Mr Rob Hayward (above) was expressing confidence yesterday as
the people of Christchurch went to the polls amid a blaze of media
publicity, Gillian Tett writes.
In spite of blustery weather, business was brisk at the 46 polling stations
in the Dorset seaside town to cast their votes for one of the 14 candidates.
Mr Peter Coupland, a Conservative party teller, said: 'We have never seen it
like this before in Christchurch. This by-election has attracted more
activity than all the recent general elections put together.'
Pensioners make up a third of the area's population and all parties arranged
cars to take hundreds of elderly voters to the booths.
The Liberal Democrats claimed record levels of volunteers to support their
candidate, Mrs Diana Maddock. One organiser said yesterday: 'The Tories are
bringing their supporters in from nursing homes, and we want to make sure
none of our lot forgets what day it is.' The fact that it was pension day,
the organiser added, might have tempted more elderly voters than usual to
venture out.
Pensioners Mr and Mrs Stride said they had switched their support from the
Tories, who are defending a 23,000 majority, to the Liberal Democrats
because they were fed up with 'VAT on fuel, crime and all those political
shenanigans we've seen on telly'.
Mrs Gay Peek said her entire family had decided to stay with the
Conservatives 'because it would be very silly to have a hung parliament'.
Mrs Bridget Gee, who had brought her grandchild to the poll, said she was
deserting Labour and its candidate Mr Nigel Lickley on pragmatic grounds. 'I
voted Labour before,' she said. 'But this time I'll vote Liberal because I
think they have a chance.'

VSEL is being investigated for possible under-reporting of profits since

Under the privatisation agreement, if VSEL made pre-tax profits of more than
Pounds 90m in the six years after it was sold it would have to pay half the
extra to British Shipbuilders up to a limit of Pounds 40m.
After extraordinary items VSEL made Pounds 35.8m over the period, said the

But it said a review by British Shipbuilders accountants' 'raises a

FT  30 JUL 93 / Councils cannot 'opt in' to review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to allow councils to 'opt in' to the review of local government in
England have been vetoed by Mr John Major.
The proposal from Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to allow councils
to vote in favour of being included in the review, was among suggestions for
overhauling the re-organisation of local government to the commission
chaired by Sir John Banham.
Today's edition of the Local Government Chronicle says the prime minister
had rejected the idea of making the review voluntary at a meeting with Mr
Gummer last week. An announcement on the revision of the review is not now
expected until September.
Mr Major's main reason, it says, was that putting the later tranches of the
review on an optional basis would encourage Scottish and Welsh councils to
try to avoid being reviewed.
Legislation on Scottish and Welsh local government is due to come forward in
the new parliamentary session which starts in November.
If the English review had become voluntary, ministers would also have faced
considerable political embarrassment in seeming to show such a lack of
confidence in a policy intended to be a vote-winner.
The Tory election manifesto pledged that a commission would examine 'area by
area' the structure of local government in England. The aim was to deliver a
council structure that would be popular with local communities and give back
self-governance to cities such as Bristol and Leicester.
So far, however, the commission has aroused controversy in each of the four
areas for which it has announced its proposals.
Even without the option of setting proportions of local councils in any one
area which would have to vote in favour of the review to be included in it,
there is still considerable scope for changing the form of the next four
tranches of the commission's work by altering its policy guidance.
Significant changes that seem likely are setting new ways of assessing cost
effectiveness and measuring local community identity.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Gaviria pins hopes on oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING oil revenues could push Colombia's economic growth from last year's
3.6 per cent to an annual 5-6 per cent, President Cesar Gaviria said
yesterday.
Mr Gaviria, on a three-day official visit to Britain, suggested that, if the
country made progress in its fight against political and drugs-related
violence, 'growth through the rest of this decade will be even higher'.
The president is pinning his hopes for higher growth on the Cusiana and
Cupiaga oil fields, in Colombia's eastern Andes. The fields are being
jointly developed by BP, Total, Triton and Colombia's state-owned Ecopetrol.
BP has estimated production will reach 150,000 b/d by the end of 1995, but a
second stage of development could take output to 600,000-800,000 b/d in
1998, a prospect Colombian officials greet with barely concealed excitement.
Colombia now produces about 450,000 b/d of crude, exporting some 180,000
b/d.
Mr Gaviria said his country was able to deal with the potentially
inflationary consequences of soaring oil revenues, and stressed the
independence of the central bank.
Earlier in his trip, aimed principally at boosting trade and British
investment in Colombia, he signed an agreement with Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, to co-operate on confiscating proceeds from drug
trafficking.
The agreement would commit both countries to trace, seize and confiscate
drug assets, according to a British official. However, a hoped-for
investment protection accord between Colombia and the UK failed to
materialise.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Loan loss provisions hit profits for World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank has reported a sharp drop in last year's profits as a result
of higher provisions against the risk that loans to the former Yugoslavia
would not be paid back.
Net income fell to Dollars 1.13bn (Pounds 750m) for the year ending June 30,
against Dollars 1.65bn the previous year, after the bank increased its loan
loss provisions by Dollars 610m to Dollars 3.15bn.
The bank announced in May that it would increase its loan loss provisions
from 2.5 per cent of loans outstanding to 3 per cent, citing 'a
deterioration in the outlook for the collectibility of loans to, or
guaranteed by, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
Yugoslavia was one of the World Bank's biggest borrowers, with Dollars 2bn
of loans outstanding last year. While Croatia and Slovenia are paying their
portions of this debt, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia and Macedonia are not.
Bad debts from these republics, together with those of Congo, Iraq, Liberia
and Syria, amount to 2.4 per cent of the World Bank's outstanding loan
portfolio.
The bank also increased its target ratio of reserves to loans from 11 per
cent to a range of 13-14 per cent over the next two fiscal years. At the end
of June its reserves amounted to Dollars 11.7bn, or 11.4 per cent of loans.
While the World Bank is not a conventional profit-seeking corporation, its
net income is important to its financial solidity, which enables it to
borrow in the capital markets at keen rates.
It also provides part of the money for the International Development
Association, the subsidiary which offers low-cost loans to the poorest
countries.

<TEXT>
MEDIUM-SIZED German mining equipment manufacturers, fighting for their
survival as Germany reduces its domestic coal production, have set up a
consortium to sell mining equipment in Russia. The barter deal has been
brokered by Raab Karcher, the diversified trading arm of Veba, the west
German energy group.
Raab Karcher, which had a 1992 turnover of DM10.5bn (Pounds 4bn), recently
signed a contract to import 350,000 tonnes of hard coal from the
Karagandaugol mine in Kazakhstan.
Proceeds from the sale of coal - to be marketed mostly in Germany, England
and France - will partially go toward repaying the German enterprises
delivering mining equipment in Russia.
The deal, which will be in part financed by subsidies from the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia, aims to give a second life to small mining equipment
producers by opening new markets in east Europe.
Manufacturers of coal mining equipment and spare parts are struggling to
cope with falling orders as German mines reduce hard coal capacity from the
current 65.5m tonnes output to an estimated 50m tonnes by the year 2005.
Germany hopes to replace its expensive local production with cheaper
imports.

FT  30 JUL 93 / US markets shrug off GDP figures: Economy grew more slowly
than expected in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy grew far more sluggishly in the second quarter than
economists had expected, but the financial markets found a silver lining to
the superficially gloomy report.
The Commerce Department said US gross domestic product grew at an annual
rate of only 1.6 per cent last quarter, after the weak 0.7 per cent growth
of the opening period.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said there were encouraging signs in the
report, but 'while we are clearly out of a recession, these figures reflect
anaemic growth that will not produce the jobs we need'.
The Commerce Department said strong rises in personal spending, business
investment and exports were offset by a sharp slowdown in inventory building
by businesses, which subtracted Dollars 25.3bn (Pounds 16.9bn) from growth
in the second quarter, after adding Dollars 23.7bn in the first quarter.
Personal consumption rose at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the second
period, led by purchases of durable goods, while non-residential fixed
investment rose at 13.3 per cent and exports at 6.7 per cent.
This left real final sales, which exclude the inventory effect, growing at
an annual rate of 3.7 per cent, after contracting at a rate of 1.2 per cent
in the first quarter.
'If you look at the guts of the report, it tells you the economy is doing
fine,' said Mr Bill Dudley, an economist with Goldman Sachs.
'The combination of final sales growth at 3.7 per cent and the slowdown in
inventory growth is a reason to be less worried about a very sluggish
number,' added Mr Jason Benderly, of Benderly Economic Associates, a
Colorado research company.
This interpretation of the figures sent bond prices up sharply yesterday,
pushing yields to record lows, while share prices soared. At the close the
Dow Jones industrial average was up 13.97 at 3,567.42.
The weak GDP figure came only a week after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, had confidently predicted second quarter growth would
reach 2.5-3 per cent. Members of Congress were last week perturbed by Mr
Greenspan's signal that the next move for US rates was likely to be upwards.
However, economists said the weak overall growth figure seemed likely to
delay plans to raise rates.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco yesterday conceded defeat in the Battle of
the Zeros and signed a decree cutting three noughts from the country's
inflation-battered cruzeiro, changing its name to the 'real cruzeiro'.
The move comes as a relief to a population whose mental skills have been
stretched to the limits by the present exchange rate of about 75,000
cruzeiros to the dollar. The digits involved in even basic sums do not fit
on calculators, causing havoc in the financial sector.
Even the low paid are receiving monthly wage packets in millions of
cruzeiros; a Big Mac hamburger costs Cr200,000, a basic television Cr30m and
buying the cheapest new car requires well over Cr1bn.
The announcement, signalling the fourth currency change in seven years, came
as a surprise. Mr Franco has always been firmly against the idea, once
saying: 'The last thing poor Brazilians need is to see their money
devalued'. He even sacked his last but one finance minister in February for
having the audacity to announce that he wished to cut three zeros from the
currency.
Since then the president has presumably been won over by the central bank,
which long ago ran out of famous Brazilians to put on bank notes, resorting
to Amazonian fishes (there are 2,000 varieties).
As news of the change spread yesterday, critics accused the government of
cosmetic measures to disguise inflation, which is forecast to top 34 per
cent a month in August. The main television channels ran warnings that the
removal of three zeros from prices did not mean the items had become
cheaper.
Unlike previous changes the announcement of the new currency is not to be
accompanied by an economic shock package or banking holiday, both of which
have become taboo following the failure of previous economic plans.
However, the new real cruzeiro, following the country's economic Truth Plan
announced in May, could prove to be an unfortunate choice of name. There is
no sign of economic stability despite the best efforts of Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the new finance minister.
With presidential and congressional elections due next year the national
mint is likely to be busier than ever.
The changes to the currency are due to come into force on Monday. The Cr5m
note, due to appear in September and decorated with a nameless cowboy, is
expected to be scrapped.
But with inflation running at 1,500 per cent a year and rising, it should
not be too long before Brazilians are all big-spending millionaires once
again.

FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japanese brewer gets rid of Chinese froth
 -Making a joint venture work / Foreign Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Kenzo Yanagi arrived at the Chinese city of Lianyungang to take control
of Japanese brewery Suntory's joint venture producing a brew called Flower
Fruit Mountain Beer, a brand inspired by a Chinese fairy tale, he
recommended an important shift in marketing strategy - change the name.
'It was a bit rural. We needed something that reflected a modern Chinese
sensibility,' said Mr Yanagi. The venture was launched in 1984, but began
producing profits last year after a decade of reforms to the management
structure, the beer recipe and, as Mr Yanagi put it, the 'workers'
consciousness'.
Hoping to flood the Chinese market with Flower Fruit Mountain Beer and earn
foreign currency from exports, the hardened joint venture partners now have
clearer goals. Their beer has a 95 per cent share of the market in the area
around Lianyungang, a port city in Jiangsu province, and they are cautiously
taking aim at Shanghai.
The Japanese company has a 50 per cent stake in China Jiangsu Suntory,
capitalised at Dollars 13m (Pounds 8.7m), sharing ownership with the
Lianyungang Light Industry Bureau, which has 30 per cent. Two state
investment bodies, the Jiangsu International Trust and Investment
Corporation (Jitic) and the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (Citic), each have 10 per cent.
Sales last year rose almost 30 per cent, Mr Yanagi said, after the launch of
two premium brands, New Century and Prince.
In the four years Mr Yanagi worked in Lianyungang, the brew was improved by
replacing the barley used by the Chinese partners with imported materials
and, later, with Suntory-developed barley from a farming venture in the
area. In earlier years, the venture could not get permission to import
materials and was stuck with the inferior product.
Suntory also experimented with the brewing process and swapped yeast types,
but the big adjustment, Mr Yanagi explains, came with 'consciousness'. The
company at first adopted a Japanese-style management system, intended to
inspire workers with regular gradings, work targets, and peer pressure.
Mr Yanagi says the 400 workers found positive motivation from a different
source - money: 'We discovered that these Japanese-style gradings did not
have such a good effect. But money is a very good incentive in China. A
bonus system was developed so that about 60 per cent of earnings are now
base salary and 40 per cent are in bonuses.'
Having dealt with the workforce, Suntory needed to replace the Chinese
senior manager who was a barrier to innovation. After the foreign partner's
customary threats to withdraw from the venture, local Chinese officials
found a spirits distillery manager who made useful suggestions instead of
finding reasons why changes could not be made.
The eager new manager, working with Mr Yanagi, who returned to Tokyo last
year, suggested the use of a 2-litre beer container, which has been a
success. They also agreed to lift the bottle price of the two new beers from
Yn1 (12 pence) to Yn1.50 for Prince and Yn1.80 for New Century, the prestige
brew aimed at more affluent drinkers.
To encourage sales, the company produced a television advertisement showing
fashionable young Chinese with Jiangsu Suntory on the table. An incentive
scheme was devised for distributors, who are entitled to a free trip to
Tokyo or Hong Kong if they meet sales targets.
But Mr Yanagi said competition was tough in China's beer market, and would
get tougher with the expansion of other foreign joint ventures. Having
refined the product, he is gradually expanding the target area: 'We do very
well in our area, but to the north (Shandong), you have Tsingtao beer, which
is dominant. Beijing is a very difficult market - the city has 13
breweries.'
Shanghai is more promising, prompting Jiangsu Suntory to sell through two
hotels in the city, though the deals were a result of local guanxi
(connections), and not drinkers discovering a superior brew. Nanjing, the
capital of Jiangsu, has also been targeted, but there, as elsewhere, retail
networks are greased by kick-backs and an honest operator can find doors
difficult to open.
As for exports, there were trial shipments to the US, Singapore, Italy and
Malaysia, but the quantities were small and the cost of marketing far
greater than the returns.
'In contracts, the Chinese partner likes to put in a specific figure for
exports. In our contract, we said that we would try to export as much as
possible, but we did not make a specific obligation. We did not accept a
target.'
The depreciation of the yuan has created disagreement among the partners on
valuations. The Chinese side insists on valuing the imported machinery in
local currency, while the Japanese company wants it converted to foreign
currency, believing that the worth is understated.
But the disputes are fewer than when Mr Yanagi arrived in Lianyungang: 'It
is very difficult to be clear about what will happen in China, but the beer
market is not so bad. We are now making profits. I think we should extend
the venture (expiring in 1999) for another 10 years.'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE trade ministers of the US, Canada and Mexico yesterday gathered in
Washington to begin their final attempt to resolve differences over
enforcement of labour and environmental laws and mechanisms to finance the
costs of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Thomas Hocking, the Canadian trade minister, said before beginning talks
with his counterparts - Mr Mickey Kantor of the US and Mr Jaime Serra Puche
of Mexico - that the three would have to meet next week to finish the
supplemental agreements designed to protect jobs and the environment and to
guard against import surges.
On Capitol Hill, there were further signs yesterday that Nafta is in
political trouble. There were reports that the Clinton administration had
rejected proposals for a 'Nafta plus' package, which would include the side
pacts and a North American Development Bank. Plans to announce a 'Nafta
czar' to press the agreement through Congress have also been delayed without
explanation.
The National Economic Council is said to have opted for a two-track policy,
creating both a commission to implement clean-up and water treatment
projects, and a funding entity in the Inter-American Development Bank to
provide financing.
Supporters of the so-called NADBank include many Democrats who otherwise
oppose Nafta. Among them is Congressman Esteban Torres, who said he was
'appalled the administration is shooting itself in the foot' by rejecting
the idea of an independent development bank, which would loan funds to
communities in all three countries damaged by the restructuring of the job
base in North America.
Rarely a day passes without opposition being voiced against Nafta. On
Tuesday 100 Democratic congressmen wrote to President Bill Clinton
requesting that he delay Nafta until healthcare reforms are completed.
On Wednesday Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and several other colleagues
released data showing that soil and water samples they had taken on a visit
to the US-Mexican border were contaminated with industrial pollutants.
The Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think-tank, issued this week
an analysis of 34 companies which have set up lobby efforts in the US. The
report said at least nine of the companies had shipped thousands of jobs to
Mexico and 10 of them were among the top 30 US polluters.

FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: ABB eyes Russian power venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is in talks which
could lead to it becoming the first western company to produce power plant
from a former Russian defence factory.
ABB confirmed this week it was in joint-venture discussions over the future
of a Russian defence and aero-engine factory, although it declined to say
where the factory was or with whom it was negotiating. LegIt added it was
talking to a number of possible partners about joint ventures in Russia.
The Zurich-based company is known to be considering developing local
production of power plant in Russia. Use of a former defence and aero-engine
plant could enable it to produce equipment such as gas turbines for the
local market.
ABB is keen to sell combined-cycle gas turbine plants in Russia, which many
observers believe would be a better option for Russia, with its abundant gas
supplies, than modernising its nuclear power stations.
Other western power equipment manufacturers have ventures in Russia, but not
with defence factories. Siemens of Germany has a joint venture with
Leningrad Metal Works, a St Petersburg steam turbine producer. The venture,
Interturbo, will develop and manufacture gas turbines for the Russian market
and eventually for export.
GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, signed a co-operation
agreement in 1991 with the Kirov Works, another St Petersburg steam turbine
producer. The deal covers the manufacture, assembly and packaging of 25MW
gas turbines for the Russian market.
ABB has in recent years placed greater emphasis on expansion in eastern
Europe - particularly Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary -
and views Russia as a long-term opportunity.

FT  30 JUL 93 / NY judge dismisses Altman charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GOVERNMENT attempts to prove that Mr Robert Altman helped the
now-collapsed Bank of Commerce and Credit International gain illegal control
of a US bank were dealt a blow yesterday when a New York judge dismissed
four of the eight criminal charges against the prominent Washington lawyer.
Judge John Bradley of the New York state supreme court did not explain why
he dismissed the charges, which included the most serious count of bribery.
The move came in response to a call from Mr Altman's lawyers for a dismissal
on the grounds that federal prosecutors had failed to prove the lawyer had
received bribes from BCCI.
The prosecution had alleged that during the 1980s Mr Altman participated in
a conspiracy to allow BCCI illegally to acquire First American Bankshares,
Washington's biggest bank. Mr Clark Clifford, a former US defence secretary
and leading figure in the Democratic party, was indicted on the same charges
last year but was deemed too ill to stand trial.
During the four-month trial prosecutors argued that Mr Altman and Mr
Clifford, who were senior officers of First American, acted as 'front men'
for BCCI, which secretly controlled the Washington-based bank.
The two lawyers were accused of accepting millions of dollars of bribes from
BCCI in the form of loans, share profits and legal fees.
Although yesterday's dismissal is a victory for Mr Altman, he still faces
four counts, including charges that he schemed to defraud regulators by
submitting false documents.
His defence team began its presentation yesterday, and is due to conclude by
August 9.
The indictments against Mr Altman and Mr Clifford were filed in July last
year.

AN Anglo-American consortium which is poised to buy east Germany's giant
Mibrag brown coal fields has been granted an extension of the sole
negotiating rights by the Treuhand agency charged with privatising east
German industry.
The Treuhand, which owns Mibrag, granted Powergen, the British-based
utilities company, and NRG of Minneapolis, a subsidiary of Northern States
Power Company, the sole negotiating rights until July 31, but will agree to
extend them for another few weeks for 'technical reasons'.
A banker involved in the negotiations said yesterday that the contract was
in its 'final stages. This is an enormous contract. The lawyers are working
flat-out' to complete it.
The contract, which entails the consortium buying the lignite fields, which
straddle the eastern states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, is also linked to
its purchase of a 44 per cent stake in the Schkopau power generating plant
near Leipzig. The acquisition of the power plant will give the consortium a
stepping stone into the utilities sector in east Germany, which is
monopolised by west Germany's three large utilities. It is expected to pay
DM1bn (Pounds 390m) for the mines.

FT  30 JUL 93 / AZT 'effective on Aids'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AZT, the controversial treatment for the Aids-causing virus, HIV, is
effective in slowing progression to Aids, according to a large-scale study
published yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The study appears to contradict another trial, the Anglo-French Concorde
study published earlier this year, which called into question the
effectiveness of the drug in HIV-positive patients who had not developed the
disease.
AZT, also known as Retrovir, and manufactured by the UK pharmaceuticals
group Wellcome, remains the only treatment licensed for HIV-positive
patients without symptoms.
The new trial compared the drug with a placebo on 993 asymptomatic patients
for an average of two and a half years in Australia and Europe. All patients
had a CD4 cell count - a measurement of the immune system's strength - of
above 400. A normal level is more than 1,000.
The trial showed that, compared with those on the placebo, the CD4 counts of
those on AZT were half as likely to develop Aids or Aids-related diseases or
to suffer a deterioration in CD4 cell counts below 350.
In an editorial about the most recent trial, The New England Journal of
Medicine concluded: 'The results show a statistically significant advantage
with early therapy and good tolerance of zidovudine (AZT). . . The
implication is that most patients should be treated, but the benefit may be
greatest if therapy is begun when CD4 cell counts are over 300 to 400.'
The Concorde study took a broad range of asymptomatic patients, many of whom
had CD4 cell counts well below 400 and some as low as 200. It may be that
AZT is less effective in such patients.
The new trial supports earlier studies suggesting AZT is effective and
contradicts the Concorde programme. Wellcome has maintained the preliminary
conclusions of the Concorde trial, the full results of which have yet to be
published, suffered from statistical problems.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Industrial output declines 5.1% in year
</HEADLINE>

   By GORDON CRAMB

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL production in Japan is in its longest ever downturn, figures from
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry showed yesterday.
Output in June fell 5.1 per cent year-on-year, its 21st successive month of
decline. The previous record stretch was 20 months from May 1974 to the end
of 1975. The economic environment which will be inherited by whichever
government is formed in the coming weeks is thus the gloomiest for nearly a
generation.
The latest fall was the worst since February, when a 5.8 per cent annual
fall was recorded. It bears out a warning earlier this week by Mr Osamu
Takatori, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, that recent data
appeared to give the lie to earlier assumptions that the corner had been
turned.
For the second quarter as a whole, industrial production was down 4.5 per
cent from the same period of 1992 and 1.7 per cent below that of the first
three months of this year.
On a month-on-month basis, though, seasonally adjusted output for June
emerged 1.3 per cent higher, the first rise since March, when a 2.5 per cent
upturn was followed by two months of downward movements.
Shipments rose 2.1 per cent in the month but, reflecting the amount of
destocking of goods still in the pipeline, inventories rose 0.4 per cent for
a second successive monthly rise. Compared with a year earlier, the reining
back of supply and demand meant inventories were down 4.9 per cent and
shipments off 4.8 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S constitutional court yesterday ruled as illegal the
government's 1985 dissolution of the Kukje group, then the country's seventh
largest conglomerate, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The decision could have widespread implications for relations between Korean
industry and the state.
The forced dismantling of Kukje was part of an industrial restructuring
programme in the mid-1980s by the government of President Chun Doo-hwan, the
country's former military dictator. Almost 80 financially troubled private
companies were merged, liquidated or sold by government order.
The court ruling is likely to set the stage for extensive legal battles as
Mr Yang Chung-mo, the Kukje founder, and other owners try to recover
confiscated assets that were distributed to other industrial groups.
The court, acting on an appeal filed by Mr Yang, declared that Mr Chun's
actions were an arbitrary use of presidential powers.
When Kukje encountered financial difficulties in late 1984, President Chun
refused to allow Korea First Bank, the group's main bank, to provide new
loans to rescue it. Instead, Kukje was declared bankrupt in February 1985
and divided up, with its 20 subsidiaries sold to other companies.
The Chun government had said Kukje's problems resulted from over-expansion
and poor management. Mr Yang said yesterday the ruling 'has paved the way
for me to rise again as a businessman and I will rebuild the Kukje group.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Coalition to push hard for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCUMENTS intended to outline the policies to be pursued by the coalition of
parties aiming to form Japan's next government yesterday provided clues to
some of the issues which could easily divide them.
In putting together the policy statements, the seven parties from the lower
house, plus one pro-reform grouping from the upper house, were careful to
pay respect to the sensitivities of each member and use language vague
enough to keep everyone happy.
The coalition members are the Social Democratic party, the Japan Renewal
party, the Komeito, the Japan New party, the New Harbinger party, the
Democratic Socialist party, and the United Social Democratic party. They
were joined by the Democratic Reform party, an upper house group, which will
not vote for the prime minister.
Their policy agenda began with an all-embracing, idealistic agreement
affirming their intention to push for political reform by the end of this
year, and made clear that there will be no sudden shifts in foreign or
economic policy. They are in favour of peace, market forces, and safe food
and energy supplies.
More interesting is the fine detail further down in their accord, which
promises a 'people-oriented' budget next year, as well as the
decentralisation of government functions, a pet policy of Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the JNP leader and a former provincial governor, who is annoyed by
the concentration of resources in Tokyo.
The parties agreed to discuss an income tax reduction, which is already on
the discussion table, and to co-operate with other nations in solving
international trade imbalances through 'market-oriented economic rules,' a
reference to the US pressure on Japan to reduce its large and growing trade
surplus.
While supporting a resolution of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
talks, the parties declare they are opposed to the opening of Japan's rice
market, one of the still unsettled agricultural issues and of particular
interest to politically influential farmers' groups.
However, Mr Hosokawa, as well as senior members of the JRP, have argued in
favour of rice imports, and the policy appears to have been included to
ensure the support of the SDP, the largest opposition party, which is
against liberalisation. Trade reformers in the JRP may be counting on a
collapse of the coalition before a Uruguay Round agreement.
The SDP had also opposed participation in the UN peacekeeping operation in
Cambodia, but has relented for the sake of the coalition, which says Japan
should 'co-operate in UN-led international peacekeeping operations'. The
parties also plan to 'pursue the reform of the UN,' presumably including a
permanent seat on the UN security council.
A coalition government would want to 'reform the education system' and make
Japanese children 'individualistic and independent.'
Foreign ministry officials expressed concern that a coalition government
would be unable to react quickly to an unexpected crisis. There was also
concern at the ministry that the parties would want to freeze or cut defence
spending if they are in charge of preparing the next budget. Another foreign
ministry official said the coalition will have difficulty dealing with tough
trade requests from the US.
Officials at the finance ministry expected no substantial changes in
budgetary or taxation policies by a coalition, and are reassured that Mr
Tsutomu Hata, JRP leader, is a former finance minister.
COALITION'S POLICY ACCORD
Reform of the political system by the end of the year, including the
introduction of system of single-seats and proportional representation, as
well as tougher punishment for corruption and a ban on corporate donations.
Strengthen Japan's international profile by playing an important role in the
quest for peace and disarmament by honouring existing basic policies on
diplomacy and defence
Base ecnomomic policies on market forces, and maintain co-operation with
other countries in a stable development programme; take responsibility for
strict safety controls on food and energy generation.
Show remorse for involvement in the (second world) war, and show willingness
to promote peace in and development of Asia and the world.
Encourage development of a lively, welfare-minided, and cultured society

become the country's next prime minister, after a coalition of opposition
parties pledged to support him.
The Liberal Democratic party, which lost its majority in the July 18
election, now faces a spell in opposition for the first time since 1955.
The immediate reaction to Mr Hosokawa's likely appointment was a 3.2 per
cent jump in Tokyo stock prices. But Japanese bureaucrats expressed concern
that such an unwieldy coalition would be unable to cope with trade friction
or a sudden international crisis.
Seven parties, ranging from the left-wing Social Democratic party to the
conservative Japan Renewal party, have agreed to appoint a joint cabinet.
Negotiations began yesterday for ministerial posts, which will be finalised
after a parliamentary vote for prime minister. The vote is expected next
Thursday.
The parties released their first detailed policy statement, which gives
priority to political reform, including a ban on corporate donations.
However, it maintains most of the present economic and foreign policies,
although it does hint that defence outlays could be cut and social welfare
spending increased if the coalition presides over next year's budget.
Meanwhile, the LDP will choose its prime ministerial candidate today at a
party meeting which will have the choice of Mr Michio Watanabe, ailing
former foreign minister and old-style politician, and Mr Yohei Kono, chief
cabinet secretary, who has promised to reform the party if selected.
Unless the LDP can convince one of the coalition members to defect in the
next few days, the party's candidate will lose in next week's parliamentary
session, as the coalition can count on at least 245 votes to the LDP's 225.
Business leaders, accustomed to dealing with the LDP, yesterday welcomed the
expected appointment of Mr Hosokawa, the grandson of a Japanese wartime
leader and member of a family which ruled parts of southern Japan during the
feudal era.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers' Associations,
said the coalition might cause confusion after taking office because of
policy differences among members.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Zimbabwe to slash budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S finance minister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, yesterday presented a
deficit-cutting budget designed to satisfy the country's World Bank and IMF
creditors.
By containing spending increases to under 10 per cent while projecting a
23.5 per cent rise in revenue, Mr Chidzero was able to promise that the
deficit will be halved in the current year to June 1994 to 5.4 per cent of
GDP from 11 per cent in 1992-93.
Substantial savings were possible with the reduction in drought relief
expenditure and the cut in subsidies from more than ZDollars 920m (Pounds
93.9m) last year to ZDollars 272m in 1993-94. Drought relief assistance is
down to only ZDollars 50m from ZDollars 300m last year.
Despite a 14 per cent rise in defence spending and increases of 12.6 per
cent in education and 9 per cent in health, the budget deficit is projected
to fall from ZDollars 3.4bn last year to ZDollars 2.1bn in 1993-94. This
assumes a rather stronger recovery from drought and recession than generally
forecast in the private sector.
Mr Chidzero is predicting 4 per cent growth in GDP this year, which private
sector economists regard as hugely optimistic, especially in the wake of the
publication this week of official figures showing that industrial production
fell by more than 22 per cent in the first five months of the year while
mining output was down 2 per cent in the first quarter.
Surprisingly, too, in a budget which provides very little new information on
the state of the economy, Mr Chidzero makes no mention of the deepening
crisis in the tobacco and beef industries.
Government spending is forecast to fall to 38 per cent of GDP from 44.6 per
cent last year, while revenue will be little changed at around 33 per cent
of GDP. As expected, Mr Chidzero reduced the top rate of personal income tax
to 45 per cent from 50 per cent, applicable to people earning over ZDollars
48,000 a year while the corporate tax rate is cut to 40 per cent from 42.5
per cent.
The main tax increase is the expected 28 per cent rise in petrol duty,
though the actual price increase is likely to be somewhat greater, because
distributors have also been promised an increased operating margin. Duties
on beer and cigarettes have been raised while, to protect the domestic
industry, duty increases have been imposed on imported wines and spirits.
The budget has been welcomed by the business community, but economists have
been quick to point out that it rests on two very fragile assumptions - that
the recovery from drought and recession will be much stronger than widely
forecast and that the government, in the run-up to elections due in 18
months, can impose a 10 per cent cut in real public spending.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Seven samurai defer to Hosokawa: Mr Hosokawa will take
office having explained little about his political ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE seven samurai, Japan's seven opposition party leaders, gathered
yesterday, it was appropriate that they deferred to Morihiro Hosokawa, scion
of a feudal ruling clan and still sometimes called 'my lord' by his loyal
constituents.
Mr Hosokawa, 55, has struggled to turn his cultivated elegance into a party
political personality, but one reason for his appeal is the obvious
difference between a self-consciously thoughtful individual and the abrasive
confidence of many other Japanese politicians.
If all goes according to plan in the next few days, Mr Hosokawa will become
prime minister, but he will take office having explained little about his
political ideas, other than that he wants 'reform' and a 'new way of
political thinking.'
His stay in office could be short, as the seven samurai are a strange mix of
people and ideas, and could fall out permanently over issues ranging from a
rice market opening to nuclear power development. They issued a vague
statement yesterday, which was general enough to keep all happy but resolved
none of their disagreements on policy detail.
In the end, Mr Hosokawa was preferred to Mr Tsutomu Hata, the leader of the
Japan Renewal party, supported by several opposition parties, but thought to
have uncomfortably close ties to the Liberal Democratic party. Mr Hata's
defection from the LDP brought down the government, and his party is
confident his turn as prime minister will come.
Inevitable comparisons were being made yesterday between Mr Hosokawa and his
grandfather, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, prime minister from 1937 to 1939, and
again from 1940 until just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941.
Prince Konoe had thought himself capable of containing the Japanese
military, but overestimated his powers of influence and underestimated the
consequences of aggression in China that he had approved.
Having formed the Japan New party only a year ago, Mr Hosokawa has been
carried quickly by circumstance to within reach of the leadership. But he
has taken time to mature politically, beginning his career as a journalist
on the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun, where he had the bracing experience of
being taken hostage by student activists.
In 1971, representing the LDP, he was elected to the upper house of the
national parliament and was re-elected six years later, serving as a member
of the faction run by Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the former prime minister. Mr Hata's
JRP is an extension of the Tanaka faction, and when many Japanese want
'political reform,' they mean an end to the rough and ready, money-fuelled
Tanaka-style politics that has dominated the LDP.
Mr Hosokawa switched to local politics in 1983, when elected governor of
Kumamoto prefecture, in the south, where he enhanced his family's reputation
as the local version of royalty. He is an 18th generation Hosokawa and keeps
up the regal image, and his distance from mere politics, by playing tennis
with members of the Imperial family
Encouraged to take a third term in 1991, Mr Hosokawa declined, saying that
politicians are corrupted if they remain in the same powerful job for too
long. As governor, he once suggested the water be turned off in central
Tokyo so that politicians and bureaucrats would better appreciate the need
for decentralisation, a favourite theme of most provincial leaders.
But Mr Hosokawa was generally regarded as a mild man of considered opinions.
The gentleman politician's renewed interest in national politics is best
explained by his wife, Kayoko, who said he inherited high standards of
personal discipline from a family tutor who liked to berate him with: 'How
can you become the head of a samurai family?'
'At this point in his life, he doesn't really have any ambition for honour
or power or success. The motivation to become a politician is not that he
wants to be a great man, but that he can see a mission created for him by
history,' Mrs Hosokawa explained.
The problem with Morihiro Hosokawa is that he has not been able to explain
the mission apparently motivating him, though supporters say a detailed
explanation could lead to the collapse of his coalition. The past few weeks
have shown that he does have fine political timing, as he let other parties
call him to the leadership and left open the possibility that he would join
the LDP in a coalition.
Mr Hosokawa's priority is political reform, but even his coalition partners
have private reservations about the proposals they publicly support. When
the serious talk starts, he will face the possibility of a quick split and a
new election.
Like his grandfather, Mr Hosokawa could find that he has overestimated his
political skills, in this case by underestimating the difficulty of
controlling a coalition including socialists, the religious right wing, and
a few hardened ex-LDP backroom operators who have their own ambitions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S Supreme Court yesterday acquitted John Demjanjuk of being the
sadistic 'Ivan the Terrible' who operated gas chambers at the Nazi Treblinka
concentration camp in the second world war, writes David Horovitz in
Jerusalem.
Documentation from other Treblinka guards obtained after Mr Demjanjuk was
convicted and sentenced to death in 1988 cast 'reasonable doubt' on the
evidence identifying him as Ivan, the five Israeli judges concluded
unanimously.
The former Treblinka guards identified Ivan the Terrible as Ivan Marchenko,
an older, darker man than Mr Demjanjuk. The court was persuaded, however,
that the Ukrainian-born Mr Demjanjuk, extradited from the US in 1986, had
been an SS guard at Sobibor and other concentration camps but chose not to
convict him since they were not included in the original indictment and
since he had not been given adequate opportunity to defend himself.
Mr Demjanjuk heard the ruling without obvious emotion. His son, John Jnr, by
contrast, pronounced himself 'absolutely delighted' and said he would ask
the US authorities to allow his stateless father to return to the family
home in Cleveland, Ohio.
Treblinka survivor Mr Josef Czarny, who testified against Mr Demjanjuk at
the original trial, said after the ruling that he was still convinced Mr
Demjanjuk was 'the arch murderer of Treblinka' and that the acquittal was 'a
terrible mistake.'
The case is bound to have implications for other war crimes investigations
because of the doubts it casts on reliability of eye-witness evidence 50
years after the second world war.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Nigeria ails beyond the public eye: Economy suffers in
political maelstrom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Nigeria's government has been absorbed by the political chaos
following the June presidential elections, the economy has been sliding
deeper into crisis.
The drop in the oil price last week, to around Dollars 16.50 a barrel, is a
warning to President Ibrahim Babangida, or his successor, that Nigeria's oil
exports cannot resolve a growing balance of payments deficit.
'What worries me most is the complete lack of direction in economic policy,'
said the head of one Nigerian bank.
The military regime hoped to find that direction in January by creating a
civilian Transitional Council to inject life into a structural adjustment
programme, which has failed to impress the international creditors and has
earned the contempt of most Nigerians.
Mr Ernest Shonekan, a leading industrialist who heads the Council, delivered
a 1993 budget in January based on three expectations that have not been met:
tight control on government spending; a debt relief agreement with Nigeria's
official creditors; and a minimum oil price of Dollars 17.50
'The lack of fiscal discipline is the bane of our economy,' said Mr Shonekan
in his budget speech. He proposed 'greater fiscal co-ordination and a total
clampdown on extra-budgetary releases' to cut the budget deficit to N28bn
(Pounds 746m) in 1993.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has yet to publish official figures, but
bankers estimate that the budget deficit in the first quarter of the year
alone reached N20bn, whilst the rate of inflation has accelerated well
beyond the 46 per cent recorded for 1992.
Mr Shonekan also set up two committees to make government finances more
open. However, 'neither of these committees has made its findings public',
said a western economist.
The failure to report on accounts which keep the revenue from an estimated
200,000 barrels of oil a day outside budgetary control has been one of
several stumbling blocks in Nigeria's negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund.
During formal talks in May, the Nigerian delegation and a combined IMF-World
Bank team failed to reach agreement over the oil revenue figures, the
exchange rate policy, and a method to phase out the domestic fuel price
subsidy.
The collapse of the IMF talks was a serious blow to the Transitional
Council. An Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) would provide
soft loans and unlock a debt relief package from the Paris Club of official
creditors, which is owed about Dollars 16.5bn by Nigeria, over half its
external debt. If Nigeria qualified for the Trinidad Terms, over half of
that debt could be wiped out.
But a Transitional Council plan to remove the oil subsidy was overruled by
the ruling military council, and the supply of foreign exchange from the
Central Bank to the private sector has been just 10 per cent of funds
required, which has widened the gap between the official and parallel market
rates to 70 per cent.
'The IMF is not interested in a standby agreement, they want a three-year
programme and they do not want to negotiate with a regime which has no track
record and no future after August 27' - the scheduled handover date - said
one western diplomat.
Arrears in debt service to the Paris Club topped Dollars 4bn this year and
the budget does not provide for any interest payments on foreign debt, for
which Dollars 2bn is due. Further evidence of Nigeria's insolvency came in
March when the CBN suspended payments to foreign suppliers worth over
Dollars 2bn, or nearly half this year's budget allocation of foreign
exchange for imports. The CBN has still not announced how this backlog in
payments is to be cleared, but there are inadequate foreign reserves to
cover it.
'Whichever way they tackle it, these arrears are going to give a shock to
the economy,' said a leading banker. 'If the bills are honoured, it will put
heavy pressure on the exchange rate. If they default and issue promissory
notes, it will damage Nigeria's credibility among foreign creditors.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / S Korean group's break-up 'illegal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S constitutional court yesterday ruled as illegal the
government's 1985 dissolution of the Kukje group, then the country's seventh
largest conglomerate.
The decison could have widespread implications for relations between Korean
industry and the state.
The forced dismantlement of Kukje was part of an industrial restructuring
programme in the mid-1980s by the government of President Chun Doo-hwan, the
country's former military dictator. Almost 80 financially troubled private
companies were merged, liquidated or sold by government order.
The court ruling is likely to set the stage for extensive legal battles as
Mr Yang Chung-mo, the Kukje founder, and other owners try to recover
confiscated assets that were distributed to other industrial groups.
The court, acting on an appeal filed by Mr Yang, declared that Mr Chun's
actions were an arbitrary use of presidential powers.
When Kukje encountered financial difficulties in late 1984, President Chun
refused to allow Korea First Bank, the group's main bank, to provide new
loans to rescue it. Instead, Kukje was declared bankrupt in February 1985
and divided up, with its 20 subsidiaries sold to other companies.
Kukje's leading footwear business and trading operations were transferred to
Hanil Synthetic Fiber. Kukdong Construction acquired Kukje's securities
subsidiary, which is now Dongsuh Securities, one of Korea's biggest
brokerage firms. Union Steel Manufacturing, the nation's largest producer of
cold-rolled steel sheets, was sold to Dongkuk Steel Mill.
The Chun government justified its action by arguing that Kukje's problems
resulted from over-expansion and poor management. But when parliament held a
corruption investigation after Mr Chun lost power in 1987, it was told that
Kukje's dissolution was caused by Mr Yang's refusal to give political
donations to the president and his party.
Mr Yang said yesterday the ruling 'has paved the way for me to rise again as
a businessman and I will rebuild the Kukje group.'
The Federation of Korean Industries welcomed the court's ruling, which
represents a psychological victory for Korean conglomerates, or chaebol, in
their relations with the government.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Brussels scraps proposals for rules in 'house-clearing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is scrapping around 150 proposals for new EC
legislation, a sign that its appetite for making new Community rules is
waning. The rules cover transport, energy, science, telecommunications,
consumer policy, financial affairs, the environment and agriculture.
Many are out of date, while others have been incorporated in revised
proposals. Some are 'no longer considered appropriate in current
circumstances', according to a Commission spokesman.
Among the most eye-catching are rules for harmonising national legislation
covering noise emissions from rail vehicles; rules covering the EC's
participation in an international conference in Geneva on the protection of
vegetable extracts; and a resolution calling for action to encourage
libraries in Europe to co-operate on the use of new information
technologies. An EC official described the withdrawal of the 150 proposals
as a routine 'house-cleaning exercise'.
He said it was quite separate from the Commission's efforts to root out
redundant proposals for legislation which EC leaders agreed at last
December's EC summit in Edinburgh.
This campaign is sensitive because it contains legislative proposals
currently in train. Germany, France and the UK believe it could prove a true
test of 'subsidiarity' - devolving power to the lowest appropriate national,
regional or municipal level. Earlier this week, the UK and France agreed a
list of 24 items of EC legislation which should be amended or withdrawn.
These include EC directives on employment conditions for workers in
privatised industries, on taxation of stock exchange transactions, and on
water quality.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Bosnians weigh up plan for union of republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators in Geneva yesterday proposed a union of three
Bosnian republics, in an attempt to bridge the gap between the warring
parties about the future of the region.
The plan, presented by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, seeks to
satisfy Serb and Croat demands for partition of Bosnia on ethnic lines as
well as the Moslem aim of creating a federal republic, a United Nations
official said.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic welcomed the plan and said he could
accept it with 'only minor changes' since it was 'pretty close' to the
Serb-Croat proposal for ethnic mini-states.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic last night consulted the Bosnian
collective leadership after seeking revisions in the plan, which goes
against all his calls for a more closely knit federation. But members of the
collective leadership were divided on the plan and will meet again today to
try to agree a united position.
Bosnian Prime Minister Mile Akmadzic predicted that all three Bosnian
factions, including the Moslem-led government, would accept the plan. Mr
Akmadzic, a Croat, said: 'I am really convinced that all three sides,
including the presidency. . . will agree on the new constitutional
arrangement.'
Diplomats said the mediators' proposal would give the Bosnian central
government control over foreign policy but few other powers.
A meeting of all six parties at the Geneva talks is expected later today. A
UN official said the participants at Geneva were talking 'seriously,
courteously and constructively'.
Bosnian leaders yesterday agreed on a ceasefire in the 16-month war. Mr
Izetbegovic, Mr Karadzic and the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban,
interrupted a session of talks to issue the ceasefire order to their
military commanders, said UN spokesman John Mills.
Despite the order to implement the accord immediately, there was no sign in
Bosnia that any ceasefire would hold. Previous truces have collapsed almost
immediately.
In Washington, Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the
western allies with troops in Bosnia would not tolerate further attacks on
UN troops and were prepared to launch air strikes quickly if they continued.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Money transfer fees 'too high'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN banks are charging too much for cross-border money transfers within
the EC, according to a new study by the European Commission. The study found
that two in three banks did not provide written information about their fee
scales, while the quality of service varies widely among member states.
The Netherlands, Denmark and the UK had the most efficient banking services
covering dispatch and receipt of money transfers, according to the study.
The worst services were found in Italy, Spain and Greece.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, EC commissioner responsible for the Single Market,
described the findings as disappointing. He called for the urgent adoption
of the leading European banking federations' guidelines, hinting that
failure to act could lead to legislation.
However, Mr d'Archirafi paid tribute to the efforts by some European banks
to create automatic clearing mechanisms to improve the payments network.
The Commission study estimated that in 1990 around 200m cross-border
transactions of less than Ecu2,500 (Pounds 1,890) took place in the EC.
On average, the cost of money transfers within the EC is around Ecu20, the
study revealed. The fee rises to Ecu24 if 'double charges' - fees levied by
the banks at both ends of the transaction - are included. Double charges
were discovered in 42.5 per cent of all transactions.
The Commission intends to publish a report in the autumn.

THE Tajikistan leadership, plagued by rebel attacks from neighbouring
Afghanistan, announced an amnesty yesterday for both insurgents and
refugees, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Itar-Tass news agency said the Islamic rebels operating in Tajikistan were
given until September 9 to hand in their weapons. Those in Afghanistan had
to return by the same date.
The amnesty was announced by the Tajik parliamentary leadership, dominated
by pro-communists and conservatives.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to Afghanistan from the impoverished
Central Asian state after the Islamic-led opposition was defeated in a civil
war late last year. Most of the fugitives have been reluctant to return and
the government has refused to hold talks with the rebels.
Russian and western human rights groups accused Tajikistan's government on
Tuesday of allowing the torture and persecution of refugees returning from
camps in Afghanistan.
The Tajik and Russian governments say the rebels have launched several
attacks across the border, which is guarded by Russian and Tajik troops,
with support from Afghan mujahideen.
Mr Anatoly Adamishin, the deputy Russian Foreign minister, arrived in the
Tajik capital Dushanbe yesterday to pursue Moscow's diplomatic drive to end
the border conflict. But media reports said fighting at the border was
continuing.

THE Italian government yesterday denied that the 12 EC nations had agreed
that Mr Jacques de Larosiere should head the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and said Italy was still backing the
candidature of Prof Giuliano Amato, the former prime minister.
According to Italian officials, the government is anxious to see Italy play
a more prominent role in international institutions and has decided to press
the point following the resig-nation of Mr Jacques Attali.
In pushing Prof Amato's candidature, the Italian government has also pointed
out discreetly that France already occupies sufficient top positions in
European and international organisations. The German government has been
sympathetic to the Italian view, but is motivated primarily by its need to
secure French support for the siting of the future European central bank in
Germany.
In Paris, the French government yesterday expressed confidence that Mr de
Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of France, would be selected by the EC
as its candidate to head the EBRD, despite signs that a consensus had not
yet been reached.
'We remain sure that he is the best candidate for the job,' said a spokesman
at the foreign ministry in Paris. 'We are sure that he will be the EC's
candidate.'
French officials have been lobbying hard for Larosiere's selection.
But the Italians, angered by what they see as the over-hasty action of the
Belgian finance minister in sending a letter to EC governments on Wednesday
night announcing that a consensus had been reached, are continuing their
diplomatic offensive.

POLISH officials said yesterday that, despite some opposition, enough state
sector enterprises would participate in the country's mass privatisation
plan to make the scheme viable.
Mr Ron Freeman, the acting president of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development has meanwhile confirmed that the bank will 'ensure that the
companies (being privatised) will have full access to the European Bank's
resources'.
Despite Mr Freeman's encouragement that companies seriously consider joining
the privatisation programme, 30 companies have refused to participate. The
Privatisation Ministry is conducting talks with scores more to persuade them
to join.
Under the plan, more than 600 state sector enterprises are to be handed over
to western managed investment funds. Shares will be distributed at a nominal
charge to Polish applicants. Many companies hesitant about the scheme are
planning management or employee buy-outs or are considering joint ventures
with western partners.
About 200 companies are already 100 per cent state-owned joint stock
companies which have been earmarked for the scheme and will be
participating. Another 440 companies have the choice of opting out by the
end of this month and the ministry has accepted decisions by 30 to do so.
Meanwhile, 100 companies have confirmed they will be participating,
according to Mr Jerzy Thieme, who is responsible for the scheme in the
ministry,
Implementation of the scheme will leave Poland with around 5,600 enterprises
still in state hands. Around 780 have been privatised to date.

FT  30 JUL 93 / European money transfer fees too high, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN banks are charging too much for cross-border money transfers within
the EC, according to a new study by the European Commission.
The study found that two in three banks did not provide written information
about their fee scales, while the quality of service varies widely among the
12 EC member states.
The Netherlands, Denmark and the UK had the most efficient banking services
covering dispatch and receipt of money transfers, according to the study.
The worst services were found in Italy, Spain and Greece.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, EC commissioner responsible for the Single Market,
described the findings as disappointing. He called for the urgent adoption
of the leading European banking federations' guidelines, hinting that
failure to act could lead to legis-lation.
However, Mr d'Archirafi paid tribute to the efforts by some European banks
to create automatic clearing mechanisms to improve the payments network
within the Community.
The Commission study focussed on 34 banks and almost 1,000 transactions. It
estimated that in 1990 around 200m cross-border transactions of less than
Ecu2,500 (Pounds 1,890) took place in the EC.
On average, the cost of money transfers within the EC is around Ecu20, the
study revealed. The fee rises to Ecu24 if 'double charges' - fees levied by
the banks at both ends of the transaction - are included. Double charges
were discovered in 42.5 per cent of all transactions.
The Commission intends to publish a full report in the autumn, following
consultations with the industry. The goal appears to be to use public
exposure as a means of putting pressure on the banks to improve their
services and cut fees.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REFORMERS in the Russian government and their foreign advisers yesterday
continued a fierce attack on the decision of the central bank to withdraw
from circulation all pre-1993 banknotes.
They demanded that the decision be annulled, warning of dire consequences to
the international aid package pledged to Russia if not.
Professor Anders Aslund, an adviser to the Russian government, forecast
increased inflation, a weakening of the rouble, and continued destruction of
links between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Evidence of pressure on the CIS emerged yesterday when a large aluminium
smelter in Saratov, Russia, warned that it would have to close because raw
materials from Kazakhstan had been cut off as a result of the Russian bank's
decision to withdraw the notes.
Prof Aslund warned that 'there will be a flight from the rouble' and said
the present rise of the rouble against the dollar was a 'temporary
phenomenon because of the artificially induced shortage of notes'.
Mr Andrei Illiaronov, economic adviser to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
Russian prime minister, said the issue had not been tabled at the cabinet
meeting yesterday - but would come up at a special cabinet meeting at the
end of next week called to discuss 'a whole range of the most important
economic questions'.
The latest trends in the Russian economy presented yesterday by the
government's Centre for Economic Reform show that inflation is rising again,
from a level of around 17 per cent in May to around 20 per cent last month.
Industrial production is shown as remaining stable, having recovered to the
level of July 1992.
Privatisation continues to rush ahead, with a record Rbs380bn in revenue
from privatised companies in May. Separate figures from the state
privatisation committee claim that one-third of all enterprises in Russia -
most of which are small - have been privatised.
There was 'massive' tax evasion last year, amounting to a sum equivalent to
Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn, according to Mr Vladimir Gusev, head of Russia's
tax collection service. Mr Gusev said yesterday that some 15 per cent of all
taxes were not paid for 1992. He said the growth of corporate debt estimated
at Rbs6,500bn had delayed payment of taxes.
Many companies tried to avoid taxes by dealing in cash and failing to keep
accounts.
Mr Gusev said that the International Monetary Fund and private German
companies were assisting in establishing a computer system for tax
collection - while cash registers are to be made mandatory for all sales
point.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Markets bank on falling rates: Bonds stronger across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT bond prices, which rise in anticipation of a fall in interest
rates, were stronger throughout the member countries of the European
exchange rate mechanism yesterday.
The Bundesbank decision to keep the discount rate unchanged surprised the
markets. But there had been a conviction that something had to happen to
help ease the high rate problem of the other ERM members.
Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, an economist with Midland Global Markets in London,
said: 'From a trading point of view it's not that difficult. One way or
another rates are going to come down.'
German debt prices shrugged off the Bundesbank's refusal to reduce its floor
rate from 6.75 per cent. However, Ecu bonds, which represent the whole range
of currencies in the ERM rather than just individual component parts, fell
sharply.
French government bonds rose about two thirds of a percentage point on a
conviction that either through mutual realignment or independent easing
French short-term rates will have to fall. Spanish bonds lept for the same
reason.
Outside the ERM, the attractions of sterling as a safe haven currency
prompted buyers of UK government bonds and gilt prices rose half a point in
spite of the extra supply from Wednesday's Pounds 3.25bn Treasury auction.
Gilts also shrugged off nervousness surrounding yesterday's by-election in
Christchurch, southern England, which was seen as an uphill battle for the
governing Conservative party.
Italy, also outside the ERM, saw its bond market pick up sharply.

FT  30 JUL 93 / GM rebuts Piech allegations with date, time and place:
Christopher Parkes hears Opel's detailed version of row with VW over missing
documents and former employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday reopened its
barrage on Volkswagen's defences. But there was no return fire.
VW's big gun, chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech, rolled out on Wednesday for a
brief bombardment to counter industrial espionage charges against his
employees, had been pulled back from the fray.
'In Volkswagen's view everything relevant to this subject has been said
several times. We. . . have nothing more to add,' the company said.
Meanwhile, Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice president of GM Europe, yesterday
rebutted Mr Piech's suggestions that evidence designed to incriminate VW's
production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three colleagues
might have been planted. Mr Piech referred yesterday to 'other hands' being
involved.
The four, all former GM employees, are under criminal investigation in
Germany on suspicion of industrial espionage. Mr Lopez is also the focus of
an FBI probe in the US.
Opel officials claimed that Mr Lopez - who signed a contract with VW, by
VW's own account, at 9.57pm on the evening of March 9 this year, and called
Mr Piech immediately afterwards - attended a meeting in Opel headquarters on
March 10 at which he asked for 'internal' documents to be sent to an address
in Spain.
Later the same day, he was back in Detroit, where he told Mr Jack Smith, GM
president, that he was leaving for VW, the Opel officials said. After a
tug-of-war between the two companies, in which he was offered promotion to
keep him on board, Mr Lopez left for Germany on March 15.
He left undelivered the final draft of an emotional speech, which he had
personally approved that morning, and the clouds of doubt which prompted
Opel shortly afterwards to ask German prosecutors to probe their suspicions
of industrial espionage.
According to Mr Gab, on December 2 Mr Lopez, then head of global purchasing
at GM, asked for the so-called Epos list, containing details of all GM's
European parts prices last year - equivalent to 70,000 to 90,000 print-out
sheets - to be transmitted to him in the US. These data, Mr Gab claimed,
which were sent to him on December 22, were of no use to him in his work in
the US. They had since disappeared, he added. 'And they could be in the
hands of people to whom they do not belong.'
There was more, including evidence suggesting that Mr Lopez and others had
taken part in a large-scale information gathering exercise while, as has
since been shown, he was in negotiations with VW.
Mr Lopez has repeatedly claimed that he finally decided to switch to VW on
March 9. He lost all enthusiasm, he claims, when he discovered that his pet
project, a secret super-lean car production plant, was not to be built in
his Basque homeland.
Opel said yesterday that no final decision had been made at that point. The
plan had in fact been 'frozen' much earlier because of poor business
conditions.
Indeed, on January 14, Mr Lopez had personally drafted a letter telling a
Spanish financing and construction consortium just that. The letter was
signed and sent off by Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe. The next
day, Mr Lopez, who had already been talking to Mr Piech, met Mr Jens
Neumann, the VW personnel director for the first time, Opel officials said.
Three weeks ago, Mr Lopez was disappointed again. After claiming his dream
was soon to be realised, Mr Piech publicly announced that the project was
'out of the question at this time. . . I have told Mr Lopez this.'

It's high noon for the ERM. I wouldn't give two beans for the survival of
the ERM now - David Brown, chief economist at Tokai Bank
I think this is a watershed for the ERM and could result in its break-up. I
expect heavy speculation in the next couple of days but the Bundesbank has
taken the market to the brink before and the end is not here yet - Steve
Major, Credit Lyonnais
The conservatives in the Bundesbank won the day. The bank did not want to be
too devilish - unnamed German bank economist
The Bundesbank had to decide if it wanted to sacrifice its credibility on
the altar of the EMS or keep its domestic credibility intact - Armin Kayser,
economist Swiss Bank Corp
The Bundesbank clearly is still concerned about domestic economic
developments. They weighted these more heavily than an EMS crisis - Juergen
Pfister, Commerzbank economist
The Bundesbank is in a tight corner, but I'm absolutely convinced they will
do whatever is necessary to preserve the ERM - Stefan Collignon of the
Association for the Monetary Union of Europe

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission officials reacted with a mixture of dismay and
apprehension to the Bundesbank's decision to leave its key discount rate
intact at 6.75 per cent.
'It's war,' said a senior official close to Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission. Official disappointment at the modest nature of the
Bundesbank cut was palpable.
For most of the year, the Commission has been waging a quiet campaign for
reduced European interest rates to lift the European economy out of
recession and restore confidence to the goal of economic and monetary union.
At times this year tension between Brussels and Frankfurt has surfaced. Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, visited the EC capital last
January and quashed the idea of a 'fast track' to Emu involving France,
Germany and the Benelux, supported by possible changes in the 'convergence
criteria'.
At the EC summit in Copenhagen last month, Brussels officials
counter-attacked. Many could barely hide their pleasure at the final
communique's call for an early reduction in interest rates.
When the Bundesbank reduced its discount rate by half a percentage point to
6.75 per cent ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo, the reaction
inside the Commission was positive but guarded. One official explained that
the size of the Bundesbank cut was less important than the promise that
further reductions were in the offing.
These expectations were deflated yesterday. EC officials now believe it is
unlikely that Frankfurt will move its key rates until September.

Frankfurt

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES had been rising for days that the Bundesbank might yesterday have
provided a modest fillip for European business confidence and at least token
support for the wobbling European Monetary System. But the German central
bank does not make policy decisions based on hopes. And as guardian of the
anchor currency in the European Monetary System, the credibility of its
commitment to D-Mark stability is ultimately just as important as the system
itself.
Disappointed but not surprised, German economists agreed that domestic
monetary conditions would have to show concrete signs of improving before
the central bank could proceed with cuts in its key discount interest rate.
'I did not expect them to do anything, not at what was probably the worst
possible moment,' said Mr Dieter Beier at Berliner Bank. Money supply was
growing at 7.1 per cent. Year-on-year inflation was now 4.3 per cent. 'These
are dreadful figures, and all we have is hopes that they will improve,' he
added. The Bundesbank has set targets for annual money supply growth rates
this year to be retained within a band ranging from 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per
cent, and inflation to be ground down to 2 per cent.
Yesterday, once again, external expectations crashed against the internal
constraints governing the guardians of the German currency. And the only
consolation available was what the savings bank association described as 'a
very narrow' easing, comprising a 0.5 percentage point cut in the Lombard
rate and a fixed rate of 6.95 per cent for next week's securities repurchase
tender, unchanged from this week's rate.
The so-called repo rate had dropped decisively in recent weeks, and this
week's cut from 7.15 per cent had been taken as a sign that the Bundesbank
wanted to help, said Mr Uwe Angenendt, an economist at BHF Bank. This showed
in the restoration of relative peace within the EMS after Wednesday's repo
announcement. Most observers had read this move, together with tensions
within the EMS, recent upbeat speeches from Bundesbankers, and the widely
acknowledged need for a confidence-boosting change to help lift the German
economy off the floor of recession, as a signal that the discount rate would
also come down.
But as so often in the past, economists' sense of timing was out of
synchronisation with that of the central bank.
Meanwhile, hopes remain unaltered that by the end of the year the
internationally sensitive discount rate, which governs short-term lending
rates of greatest concern to other EC economies, will be down from 6.75 per
cent today to 6 per cent or even lower. But the pace of the decline and the
size of the steps depend entirely on Germany's internal monetary and
inflationary developments. At the same time, Mr Beier points out, German
industry, which makes more than 70 per cent of its borrowings on longer
terms, is enjoying the effects of real capital market rates of 2 per cent -
a record low, he says.

GERMANY'S decision not to cut its discount rate yesterday is likely to
present the French franc with its most serious crisis within the European
exchange rate mechanism, economists said yesterday.
The decision could strain Franco-German relations. The Bundesbank's
reluctance to cut rates to help its main European partner presents Paris
with a difficult decision on whether to raise interest rates sharply to
protect the currency at a time when France's recession is deepening.
The French franc came under immediate assault after the Bundesbank
announcement, losing almost 1.3 centimes against the D-Mark despite heavy
intervention by the French and German central banks. The franc traded at
slightly more than one centime above its ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the
D-Mark.
The CAC-40 Paris stock market index rose by 2.34 per cent to close at 2,036
points, its highest level in more than a year. Its sharp rise reflected an
expectation among investors of the franc being devalued within the ERM or
that it might be floated, allowing French interest rates to fall.
'The Bundesbank decision is an indication to the markets to sell the franc,'
said Mr Robin Hubbard, chief French economist at Paribas in London. 'The
Bundesbank has effectively told the markets that it has done as much as it
can to save the ERM, but that from now onwards it has to prioritise domestic
considerations.'
Economists in Paris argued that the result would be a renewed assault on the
franc, raising the prospect of devaluation or a realignment of ERM parity
rates. But they stressed that the fate of the franc was unlikely to be
resolved quickly.
In particular, they stressed the determination of the French government to
protect the franc. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has said
that an alternative to his franc fort policy would require a change in prime
minister. 'They are condemned to follow this policy through,' said one Paris
banker.
Economists argued that the survival of the existing franc/D-Mark parity
would partly depend on whether and for how long the French government could
raise interest rates. Last week, the Bank of France raised overnight rates
from 7.75 per cent to 10 per cent in an attempt to bolster the franc's
defences. But with gross domestic product expected to contract by 0.7 per
cent this year, and with unemployment forecast to reach 12.5 per cent by the
end of December, a policy of sustained interest rate rises does not appear
plausible, say economists.
However, said Mr Hubbard: 'If the French can sweat it out for long enough
the speculators might give up. The fundamentals of the French economy are
also still good, which won't make much difference in the short term but
might provide some help in the longer term.'
One of the few sources of consolation yesterday for the Bank of France was
the publication of its balance sheet which showed that its net reserves
stood at FFr122.95bn (Dollars 21bn) at the end of last week, considerably
higher than economists had expected. The French central bank was forced late
last week to intervene in the franc's support, but managed to spend less
than the market estimated.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Germans place French in a double bind: Bundesbank's decision
has left the ball in France's court but options appear equally unpalatable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS policy options go, waiting for the Bundesbank to put the other members of
the exchange rate mechanism out of their misery looks close to the end of
its shelf-life. With pressure directed at strong and weak currencies alike
after yesterday's smaller than expected cut in German interest rates, it is
clear that the markets are losing confidence in the ERM itself.
The implicit message is that a peg to the D-Mark is simply not tenable,
while the inflationary strains of German unification persist, for countries
whose unemployment rates are rising as fast as those of France or Spain.
The future of the ERM now lies chiefly in the hands of the French
government. In effect, the Bundesbank has invited France to go back to an
unpalatable combination of raising short-term interest rates (again) and
supporting the franc through central bank intervention. Yet it is becoming
harder by the week to argue that the strategic benefits of the franc fort
policy outweigh the costs in lost output and employment.
There lies the credibility problem for France and for what remains of the
ERM. In the US, where the economy is growing and inflation is low, real
(inflation-adjusted) short- term rates of interest are close to zero. In
France the economy is shrinking, inflation is minimal, yet real short rates
are close to double figures. French industry and commerce are less sensitive
to short rates than the Anglo-Saxon economies. But they are not immune; and
the damage to the increasingly fragile banking system is mounting.
It follows that the further French rates rise, the less convincing the
existing policy looks to the markets - especially with a presidential
election due in less than two years. But if the French government fails to
raise rates, it will find it harder to pin the blame on the Bundesbank if
the franc is ultimately forced to float.
It is a classic double bind; and the paradox is that France does not need a
devaluation on fundamental economic grounds. French industry is more
competitive than German industry. The problem relates solely to the level of
interest rates.
If, as seems inevitable, market pressure persists, the choice will lie
between realignment within the ERM and floating the franc.
The first option is manifestly less horrific, from a political point of
view. But it would destroy the hard-earned credibility that the franc has
won since the rigid relationship with the D-Mark was established in 1987.
The result of the credibility loss would be that the markets would demand a
higher risk premium in French interest rates. Indeed, according to Mr Keven
Darlington of UBS Global Research, the level of interest rates might then be
even higher than when speculation began.
In those circumstances any hope of French interest rates falling below those
of Germany for a sustained period would be destroyed. The speculators would
return to the assault, causing further damage to the real economy. And the
policymakers would be forced to consider the last ditch solution of
floating.
That, nonetheless, is something that the government of Mr Edouard Balladur
would do almost anything to avoid.
It is widely accepted that to float would destroy the ERM which, with
European Monetary Union, remains at the core of France's European policy. It
would inflict a devastating blow on the Franco-German relationship. And it
could well end the tenure of Mr Balladur, who has said that he will not
preside over a devaluation.
This underlines the dangers inherent in other countries entrusting important
areas of domestic policy to the Bundesbank, whose agenda is all too clearly
defined by statute. The German central bank has no mandate to take into
account economic conditions in other ERM countries. It is overshooting its
targets for inflation and the money supply. And it remains justifiably
concerned at the level of inflationary pressure in the German public sector.
The irony in all this is that there is little or no inflationary pressure at
all in Germany's private sector, where exporters are being subjected to a
vicious squeeze. Equally ironic is the fact that France's anti-inflationary
credentials would probably remain intact after a float, despite any initial
devaluation. From the moment that the currency markets are forced to
evaluate the franc on economic fundamentals once again, they will have to
recognise that the French economy is in better shape than the German and
that on competitiveness grounds the need is for a weaker D-Mark, not a
stronger one.
By putting an end to prolonged currency turmoil, a float would also help
prevent the European economy succumbing to powerful deflationary forces. And
it would reduce the risk of a retreat into protectionism arising from
recriminations over wholly unintended competitive devaluations. But a float
remains the extreme option. It will not be conceded lightly by the French.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Government proposes law to protect privacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW LAW giving people in England, Wales and Scotland the right to sue for
damages up to Pounds 10,000 for invasion of privacy was proposed yesterday
by the government.
A green paper on infringement of privacy says the right to privacy should
now be recognised in law. It proposes a civil remedy allowing an individual
to sue for any invasion of privacy that causes substantial distress.
Privacy would not be defined precisely in law but would cover a person's
health, personal communications and family and personal relationships.
A range of defences would be available to the media, banks, credit agencies,
government bodies and others accused of infringing privacy. Those defences
would include consent, lawful authority, absolute and qualified privilege -
as in defamation cases - and public interest.
The government does not intend to make legal aid available for privacy
cases. Remedies would include damages up to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 and
injunctions to prevent publication of material that would result in an
infringement of privacy.
Launching the green paper yesterday, Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, said
that after years of cross-party study 'the time has come to ensure that the
law protects the privacy of everyone'.
The proposals had a mixed response from the newspaper industry, to which
they are primarily addressed. Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times,
attacked them as 'very dangerous proposals' that would 'protect the privacy
of politicians but neutralise robust journalism'. They could turn out to be
a 'busybodies' charter'.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Israel ignores US plea for ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday brushed aside US efforts to arrange a ceasefire in southern
Lebanon, sending another armoured column of tanks and motorised infantry
into the area and continuing its bombardment of Lebanese civilians for a
fifth day.
Last night Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, again
condemned Israel's offensive and called for an immediate ceasefire and a
halt to the hostilities in Lebanon which have left at least 119 dead, 500
wounded and more than 250,000 people homeless.
However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, ignored mounting
international and domestic pressure and said the operation would go on until
the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas, responsible for attacks on Israel,
were neutralised.
Mr Rabin spoke after Lebanon's information minister said Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, had telephoned Mr Rafik Hariri, the
Lebanese prime minister, and told him he was working to arrange a ceasefire
to start yesterday evening.
Mr Rabin said: 'As long as the operation's goals are not achieved we won't
cease Israel Defence Force actions. Hence all news about a ceasefire today
at 6pm are baseless.'
Aides to Mr Rabin said later that Israel was ready to halt its onslaught if
the US guaranteed Hizbollah would stop firing Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel - a seemingly impossible task for the US.
Yesterday army spokesmen said at least 43 rockets had landed in Israel - an
increase over Wednesday's figure of 28 and a sign that Hizbollah showed no
sign of giving in in spite of overwhelming Israeli firepower.
In Jerusalem, Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said he hoped Israel's
onslaught would be over by the time Mr Christopher arrived in Jerusalem on
Sunday on his Middle East visit.
Israel's army said yesterday it had fired more than 17,500 shells since
Sunday in an operation aimed at creating a refugee crisis which would force
the Lebanese government to act against Hizbollah. But a senior official in
Beirut has said the government is neither politically nor physically able to
take action against the Iranian-backed group, or voice opposition to
Hizbollah's 'resistance' to the Israeli presence in Lebanon. The official
said: 'In the eyes of public opinion we would be doing the work of Israel,
which no government in Lebanon can afford to do.'

FT  30 JUL 93 / Bundesbank fails to bolster ERM: Decision to leave discount
rate unchanged prompts heavy selling of weak currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of European economic co-operation was thrown into doubt last
night after a token cut in interest rates by Germany's Bundesbank failed to
meet demands from across the continent for easier borrowing conditions to
assist recovery.
The decision by the Bundesbank council to cut its Lombard rate by half a
percentage point, while leaving its more important discount rate unchanged,
provoked a fresh wave of selling of weak currencies in the crisis-prone
European exchange rate mechanism.
Equity and bond prices rose sharply across the continent on expectations
that the strain would force an early dissolution of the ERM, so paving the
way for lower borrowing rates.
The Bundesbank said it was continuing its policy of cautious cuts. The
Lombard rate, representing the Bundesbank's ceiling to German money market
rates, was reduced to 7.75 per cent. The discount rate, the floor rate at
which it finances the banking system, was left at 6.75 per cent.
Although given a guarded welcome by German government ministers, the move
was dismissed as technical by many private sector economists. It was
interpreted as signalling the Bundesbank's preoccupation with worryingly
high domestic inflationary pressures.
The decision was greeted with dismay by senior officials at the European
Commission, because it might open fresh divisions between Germany and other
EC members who may accuse the country of putting its own interests above
those of Europe.
'It's war,' said one senior official close to Mr Jacques Delors, president
of the Commission.
The events sparked the biggest strains in international currency markets
since the pound left the ERM last September.
A wave of selling of the French and Belgian francs, Danish krone, Portuguese
escudo and Spanish peseta prompted the Bundesbank and other European central
banks to spend an estimated DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) in buying the currencies,
mainly for D-Marks, to increase their value. Despite these moves, the five
currencies were last night close to their ERM floors leaving only three ERM
currencies, those of the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany, unscathed.
Last night, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, met Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, Bank of France
governor, and Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, treasury director, to discuss the
franc. France is under particular pressure to cut interest rates because of
a serious recession and high unemployment.
Officials in Spain, whose currency has already been devalued three times
during a year of almost perpetual ERM strains, put a brave face on the day's
developments. A civil servant in Madrid said the government would defend the
peseta's parity. 'Realignment (within the ERM) is not a hypothesis that we
are working on,' he said.
The French franc closed in London at FFr3.417 against the D-Mark in Europe,
a 1.2-centime fall on the day, after intervention by the Bank of France and
the Bundesbank. It slipped as low as FFr3.4262 in early US trading, but
recovered to FFr3.4105 at the close. It was at FFr3.4157 in early Tokyo
trade. Its ERM floor is FFr3.4305. The krone was also badly hit in European
trading, falling below its ERM floor against the Dutch guilder at one stage.
By the close of trading it was at DKr3.39 to the D-Mark, fractionally above
its ERM floor. The Belgian franc, among the most closely tied currencies to
the D-Mark, was also trading close to its ERM floor in the US.
The peseta and the escudo both fell against the D-Mark despite substantial
intervention from their central banks. In US trading, the peseta was just
above its ERM floor against the German currency at Pta82.24.
The dollar and sterling were boosted by the ERM crisis. Sterling closed in
London 1 pfennig up on the day at DM2.5775, despite strong speculation of a
UK base rate cut, and firmed slightly in New York to DM2.579. The dollar
reached its highest level against the D-Mark for two years, closing in
London at DM1.7345, up nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs, firming to DM1.7395 in New
York.
The decision by the Bundesbank council, in its last meeting until August 26,
effectively blocks significant monetary easing across Europe for the next
month while other ERM currencies remain tied to the D-Mark.
It sparked market expectations that other recession-hit nations in the ERM
would find this restriction too much to stomach, and so follow the lead of
Britain and Italy last year by quitting the system.
French equity investors supported this theory, pushing up share prices by
2.3 per cent to the highest level since May 1992. Dutch and Spanish share
indices rose by more than 1.5 per cent, while in London the FT-SE 100 index
gained 33.4 to close at 2,917.6, a four-month high.
On bond markets, German, French and Spanish government securities all moved
up, while UK gilts gained half a point.

FT  30 JUL 93 / Lib Dems win Christchurch with 35% swing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT crashed to a record-breaking defeat in the Christchurch
by-election early this morning. In the latest blow to Mr John Major's
battered administration, the 15th safest Conservative seat in Britain was
won by the Liberal Democrats.
The surge of discontent which has driven Mr Major's popularity ratings below
those of any post-war leader saw a 23,015 Tory majority at the general
election replaced by a comfortable 16,427-vote Liberal Democrat victory.
A swing of 35 per cent from the Conservatives was the largest in post-war
politics. It exposed a middle-class backlash larger than those which
triggered the crushing Tory defeats at Torrington in 1958, Sutton and Cheam
in 1972 and Newbury in May of this year.
The 20,000 fall in the Conservative vote was also the steepest in recent
history, forcing Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman to concede that it
was 'a very bad result indeed'.
It will intensify calls from Conservative MPs for the government to abandon
the planned imposition of VAT on domestic fuel. But that option was ruled
out immediately by Sir Norman.
After a wretched year of electoral defeats and political U-turns the only
consolation for Mr Major was a complete collapse in Christchurch of the
Labour vote.
But the humiliating defeat in his party's electoral heartlands still left Mr
Major facing the threat of an autumn of discontent among Conservative party
activists. His Commons majority has been reduced to 17 and the possibility
of another turbulent party conference in October and of a tough November
Budget will maintain the present question mark over his leadership.
The outcome intensified government fears that Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats, victors in Newbury and in the county council elections in May,
are poised to make permanent inroads into the government's southern
strongholds. Christchurch had been held continuously by the Conservatives
since 1910.
Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, secured 33,164 votes
(13,612 in 1992) against the 16,737 (36,627 in 1992) won by Mr Rob Hayward,
the Conservative candidate.
As expected, the Labour vote was squeezed by the two other parties with Mr
Nigel Lickley getting only 1,453 votes (6,997 in 1992), losing his deposit.
The turnout of 74.3 per cent was below the 80.7 per cent in the general
election but still high for a by-election.
Ministers hope the long summer parliamentary recess will provide a breathing
space for Mr Major to capitalise on the end of his party's civil war over
Maastricht and on the economic recovery. They were also taking comfort from
the fact that the defeat had been heavily discounted.
But the intense public anger in Christchurch over imposition of VAT on
domestic fuel and over threatened cuts in welfare spending will complicate
greatly the task of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in framing his
November Budget.
As Mr Clarke prepared for a pre-Budget planning session at his Dorneywood
country house later today, the expectation in Whitehall was that he would
find it impossible to avoid some further increase in taxation to curb the
government's massive borrowing requirement.
The chancellor has indicated that he is not prepared to retreat from the
extension of VAT to domestic fuel, but he will now face intense pressure to
use much of the revenue in a generous compensation package for the less
well-off.
The humiliation in Christchurch will strengthen Mr Major's antipathy to
further extensions of VAT and to reductions in welfare spending which fall
heavily on the party's traditional supporters among the middle classes and
the elderly.
With the Liberal Democrats' standing in southern England now at its highest
since the early 1980s, Mr Ashdown will seize on his victory to claim that
his party offers the only credible alternative to the Conservatives in their
traditional heartlands. Mrs Maddock warned Mr Major that the message of the
result was that he must 'change your policies or change your job'.
Sir Norman acknowledged that the result in Christchurch will provoke an
intensive post-mortem in the highest ranks of the party. Although the swing
of 35 per cent was the largest against an incumbent Tory government, it did
fall short of the 44.2 per cent swing against Labour in 1983 when the
Liberal Democrats captured Bermondsey.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Third foreign bank may join
Ferfin talks as consultant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company staggering under
total borrowings of about L31,000bn, (Dollars 19.6bn) may be facing
increasing difficulties in persuading banks to keep open lines of credit, in
spite of expressions of support by foreign bank creditors earlier this week.
A meeting yesterday of the five big Italian banks working on a rescue plan
for the group, which also lies at the heart of a growing storm concerning
alleged bribes to politicians over the Enimont chemicals venture, is
believed to have proposed bringing in a third foreign bank as a
'consultant'.
Citibank could join Societe Generale of France and UBS, which have already
been asked to act as advisers to the Italian five-bank committee and to the
Ferruzzi group, according to one banker present.
The suggestions that Ferfin may be facing serious financing difficulties
came as Mr Guido Rossi, its new chairman, was questioned by Milan
magistrates monitoring the rescue plan. The interrogation is believed to
have concerned Ferfin's plans for Fondiaria, the big insurance company it
controls through the quoted Gaic holding company.
In recent weeks, minority shareholders in Gaic, which is controlled jointly
by Ferfin and heirs of the late Mr Camillo De Benedetti, have been
complaining about a proposed Fondiaria rights issue, which could see control
of the insurer pass from Gaic to Ferfin's five main creditor banks.
Whereas the Societe Generale and UBS are believed to have a substantial
exposure to Ferruzzi group companies, Cititbank's lending is thought to be
about L100bn.
The decision to bring in a third foreign bank is to quell anxieties among
some of Ferfin's foreign bank creditors, which have lent around L6,500bn,
regarding the rescue plan, due to be presented by end-August. Some banks,
uneasy about the group's financial position and suspicious about the rescue,
are believed to have sharply reduced their credit lines, affecting Ferfin's
operations.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Thai politicians fight for seized assets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEN Thai politicians, whose assets were seized after a military coup in
early 1991, filed suit against Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister,
yesterday on charges of delaying the return of cash and securities worth
Bt1.8bn (Dollars 66.9m).
The assets were confiscated after a clique of generals, who used abhorrence
of official corruption as an excuse for the coup, found the politicians had
become rich in government.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, Thailand's prime minister, said yesterday that the
government would return the assets only if a court ordered it to do so.
Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, the former prime minister and now leader of the
opposition, had Bt226.5m seized; Mr Subin Pinkhayan, the former commerce
minister, had Bt608m taken away.
Critics of government corruption approved a Supreme Court ruling in April
that the seizures were unconstitutional. They saw it as a sign that might
was no longer right in Thai politics.
But the politicians are still chasing their assets, as the government's
constitutional arbiter, the juridical council, ruled that the wealth was
government property.
The finance ministry - which holds the assets - has said it has no authority
to release any money.
Mr Abhisit Vejjajiva, a government spokesman, said: 'This is not a question
of politics or policy - we are just following the law.'

Seasonally-adjusted unemployment reached 12.3 per cent in June, up from 12.2
per cent in May and 11 per cent in June last year. High short-term interest
rates, imposed to counter speculative attacks on the krone, have stifled
economic recovery and depressed industrial output, exports and imports.

<TEXT>
SERB police have broken up a three-day road blockade by farmers demanding
higher grain prices in the rump Yugoslavia, a Serbian newspaper said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
Tens of thousands of farmers in the northern Vojvodina province had blocked
main roads with tractors and combine harvesters in their biggest protest in
Serbia since President Slobodan Milosevic came to power in 1987.
The farmers were demanding that the government peg grain prices to the
D-Mark to protect them from the country's inflation, currently running at 20
per cent a day.
Belgrade newspaper Borba said they were forced to lift the blockade 'under
pressure by the police' late on Tuesday.
But the blockade's organiser, Djordje Garabandic, said: 'This has only
increased our determination. We have only temporarily suspended the
blockade.' Among the roads blocked was the highway from Belgrade to Subotica
on the Hungarian border, now the main route to western and northern Europe.
There were no reports of violence as police broke up the protest. It was the
latest in a series of actions, also involving car, metal and construction
workers protesting against declining living standards due to inflation.
Unions have called a general strike for August 5.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Brussels split over loans for steel restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday failed to agree a loan scheme to help
steelmakers establish a Dollars 1bn restructuring fund, dealing another blow
to the European Community's steel rescue plan, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Several commissioners questioned the legal basis which would be used to
implement the plan, a Brussels spokesman said.
The Commission will not be able to consider the matter again until early
September because of its August break. This could make it difficult for
steel companies to meet the Community's September 30 deadline for presenting
a restructuring plan.
That deadline was already in doubt because the EC postponed a critical
meeting of industry ministers which was supposed to resolve several steel
subsidy disputes this month.
The loan scheme is part of an EC rescue plan designed to persuade steel
companies to shed 30m tonnes of excess crude steel capacity.
The money would be lent to groups of companies, organised along three
product lines, which had agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts.
Those making the cuts would be paid by those who benefited, with the loans
helping to get the plan off the ground.
Commission sources said the scheme would involve about Ecu1bn to cover
capacity cuts of about 10m tonnes of finished steel products, divided as
follows:
Ecu700m for 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip;
Ecu140m for 2m tonnes of plates;
Ecu160m for 2.5m tonnes of heavy sections.
Brussels is seeking about 20m tonnes of cuts in finished products, but some
will have to come from companies which are not part of those groups, a
Commission official said.
The spokesman had no further details about the problems with the scheme's
legal basis, but said the Commission's legal service had some reservations.
The plan is based on provisions of the European Coal and Steel Community
treaty.
Industry ministers are scheduled to meet on September 21 to resolve disputes
over Spanish and Italian plans to aid their steel industries, a move
considered critical to the restructuring effort.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Heavy penalties imposed over milk quota failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday agreed to claw back Ecu2.3bn (Dollars
2.59bn) in unnecessary subsidies to Italy, Greece and Spain which
systematically failed to enforce milk production quotas in the 1980s.
The penalties are among the most severe in recent memory, although they fall
short of the original Ecu5.38bn in excess spending incurred by the European
Community between 1984 and 1992.
The reduced penalty was settled upon because the three member states have
pledged to respect new rules to curb overproduction, and partly because the
EC is offering an extra Ecu240m of special assistance to Italy and Spain to
remove 2m tonnes of excess milk capacity.
Both Italy and Spain face net payments this year of Ecu100m and Ecu50m only.
However, Italy faces a total bill of Ecu1.345bn - which it will 'pay'
through a reduction in EC subsidies. The EC will recover Ecu960m from Spain,
but only Ecu5m from Greece.
EC officials said the penalty levied against Italy was the toughest in more
than 20 years. It underlined the determination of Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm
commissioner, to make the new milk quota reforms work.
A Brussels spokesman stressed that the one-year increase in the Italian milk
quota of 900,000 tonnes was only provisional and would be withdrawn if the
Rome government failed to respect the rules.
The same applied to Spain's increase of 500,000 tonnes and Greece's extra
quota of 100,000 tonnes.
As late as 1991, neither Italy, Spain nor Greece had a system in place to
supervise milk production or to collect the levy, according to a report by
the Community's Court of Auditors.
The Commission continued to pay full subsidies even though failure to
collect the additional levy should have disqualified the three countries
from obtaining matching levels of spending.

<TEXT>
Worries about the cigarette price war in the US overhung international
trading group BAT Industries, which reported interim figures in line with
market expectations.
Profits were up 35 per cent to Pounds 906m and the dividend was raised by 8
per cent, which initially inspired demand for the stock, sending it forward
9 to 459p. However, a sombre analysts' meeting at which the company focused
on the stiff competition in the US cigarette market saw initial enthusiasm
wane and the shares finished a net 4 off at 446p after volume of 7m, well
above usual trading levels.
Mr Andrew Mitchell at Smith New Court said: 'Although a cloud remains over
the US tobacco side, the dividend yield remains a key attraction in the long
term.'
Rumours of a big share placing, together with the sale of a large chunk of
directors' equity holdings, took the shine off Taunton Cider, although the
stock later rallied. The shares closed just a penny off at 204p after hefty
turnover of 8.5m. The directors and family interests sold 1.6m shares at
197p. A large line of stock was said to have been placed at 201p.
The Greenalls bid for JA Devenish was declared unconditional, coinciding
with Schroder selling the rump of stock issued for those shareholders who
took the cash alternative. These shares were bought at 350p and placed in
the market, with total turnover hitting 10m. Greenalls closed 2 easier at
353p. Devenish finished 9 ahead at 368p.
Hotel group Stakis placed 18m new shares in the market through its broker

Stakis slipped a penny to 55p.
A large seller in Wembley left the shares 2 down at 11 1/2 p after turnover
of 1.4m.
Results from BT failed to excite investors, with worries over increased
competition and regulatory concerns overshadowing events. The shares faded
to close 1 1/2 off at 417 1/2 p.
Reuters Holdings gave up 5 to 1439p in spite of a buy note from NatWest
Securities as sellers continued to nibble away at gains made on the recent
share buy-back plan.
Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce eased 3 1/2 to 138 1/2 p, with overseas
holders believed to have been among the chief sellers. Volume at the close
was 3.8m shares.
Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel added 10 at 444p, following
Tuesday's agreement between the company and TransManche Link, the consortium
constructing the tunnel. National Express ended 9 up at 249p after a stake
of around 8 per cent changed hands.
Profit-taking after its recent run left British Aerospace 6 lighter at 416p.
A slight shortage of stock and a reported recommendation from Strauss

positive stance from Panmure Gordon continued to boost Vosper Thornycroft
and the shares advanced a further 14 to 641p.
Among the motor stocks, T. Cowie firmed 4 1/2 to 248p on the prospect of
good August car sales.
Profit-takers moved into Pearson after the progress achieved on the previous
day on the back of plans to spin off two parts of its operations. The shares
retreated 10 to 457p.
Fortunes moved in the opposite direction for Mirror Group Newspapers, which
enjoyed a rally to recover more of the ground lost in the tabloid price war.
At 154p, the stock added 5.
Good results from a US rival of lubricants group Burmah Castrol led to
demand for the stock. The shares strengthened 15 to 731p, with sentiment
boosted by news that it was raising its stake in Castrol India to 51 per
cent from a previous 40 per cent. Shell Transport put on 4 at 632p in volume
of 2.4m, ahead of next week's figures.
Turnover in British Gas rose to 11m as the shares continued their recent
recovery, gaining 7 at 306p. There was speculation that further job cuts may
be announced if the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommends a
restructuring of the business. A summary of the report is expected on August
17. Hopes of a recovery in oil prices boosted Enterprise Oil, which rose 10
to 455p.

Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary, helped the shares improve 5 to
201p, in trade of 4.7m.
Insurance and financial services group Lloyds Abbey Life climbed 11 to 418p
after a 7.3 per cent increase in profits.
The agreement between Eurotunnel and TML had a mixed effect on building
shares. Costain edged up a penny to 37p, while Taylor Woodrow closed at its
starting level of 114p after having reached a high of 116p. George Wimpey
receded 6 to 169p after profit-takers took the shine off the rise made on

622p.

513p, Central Independent TV moving forward 5 to 1970p and Grampian TV
increasing by 2 to 230p.

improvement in first-quarter profits.

the company.

Drugs group Wellcome surged on news that it is to set up a joint venture
with the US pharmaceutical group Warner-Lambert to market over-the-counter
(OTC) versions of some of its top-selling prescription drugs. The US
company, which specialises in OTC products, also unveiled a similar
arrangement with Glaxo, although the longer development time for the
particular products meant the latter's shares rose less sharply. They
finished 10 ahead at 558p.
Wellcome jumped 31 to 696p in heavy volume of 4.5m. While pharmaceutical
analysts said the development was an important strategic move for the group,
they added that it did not remove the underlying problems which have seen
the shares underperform the market in recent months. 'Wellcome's
difficulties lie in its prescription drug business, with increased
competition and regulatory worries,' said one leading specialist.

FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy sale of Forte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT activity in Forte shares accelerated to extraordinary proportions
yesterday as the stock recorded its biggest ever daily trade with 29m shares
changing hands. This included a line of 13.9m as one institutional investor
decided to reduce its holding and dealers reported that another single
institution had picked up the full amount. Cazenove was said to have done
the business, buying the stock at around 206 3/4 p and selling it on for a
penny more.
The sale dented the share price, which was further undermined as Mr Mark
Finnie at NatWest Securities returned from a meeting with the company to
reaffirm his sell advice on the stock. 'The share price continues to
overestimate the rate at which earnings will recover,' he said.
The negative NatWest stance followed a muted response from other brokers
after recent meetings with the company. The share price has fallen,
accordingly, from a high of 229p just over a week ago. Yesterday it lost a
further 5 to close at 214p.
However, Forte loyalists, who believe the company is well placed for
recovery, were quick to point out that a near 2 per cent stake in the stock
had found a single ready buyer and that the price had held up well.
The debate in the stock market over Forte's recovery potential has been a
feature of the leisure sector in recent weeks, prompting hefty two-way
business in the shares.

FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie backs away from 2,900 mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES towards lower interest rates in Germany and a successful outcome to
the auction of British government bonds were not enough to take the London
stock market through the higher end of its technical trading range
yesterday.
After challenging the Footsie 2,895 area at the day's peak, the market gave
back most of its gains later, with the final plus of only 4.8 to 2,884.2 on
the index reflecting little more than rises in Glaxo and Wellcome, which had
announced important marketing agreements with Warner-Lambert, of the US.
Investors were clearly taking profits in a stock market which must today
face significant challenges to its recent recovery of confidence.
The stock market was not completely convinced by the money market arguments
that yesterday's reduction in German repurchase rates would mean a cut in
Bundesbank discount rate today, followed by a cut in UK base rates tomorrow.
A  1/4 point reduction in German discount rate would not be enough,
according to UK analysts, and Friday morning is certain to bring bad news on
the Christchurch by-election showing of Mr John Major's Conservative party.
However, the news from Germany pushed the Footsie ahead by 16.3 at
midsession, and the blue chip shares were also encouraged by a brief move
above 2,900 in the FT-SE 100 September futures contract. Equities also
responded to strength in government bonds following news that the Pounds
3.25bn bond auction had attracted a 2.29 times cover and a healthily narrow
spread of bid prices.
But with the current equity trading account closing tomorrow night,
profit-takers were unwilling to leave share gains to run any further. In its
new trading session, Wall Street extended its fall away from its recent peak
to show a loss of 16 Dow points in London hours yesterday.
The retreat by the stock market during the second half of the session was
all the greater since it was offset by the sharp rises in Glaxo and
Wellcome, which between them represented a 4-point gain on the Footsie.
The brighter tone in equities was better displayed in the second line
stocks, and reflected in a 6.1 gain in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed
at a new high of 3,244.8.
Seaq business jumped to 690m shares yesterday, with non-Footsie shares
making up about 60 per cent of the total, a relatively high percentage. On
Tuesday, 662.6m shares through the Seaq network were worth Pounds 1.58bn in
terms of retail, or customer, busi-ness - with this figure boosted by the
Pounds 76m placing of shares in Pearson by Mr Rupert Murdoch.
Strategists were not surprised to see the stock market balk at the Footsie
2,900 area, but drew attention to successful placings of large lines of
stock at, or close, to market prices. If a cut in base rates materialises
within the next few days, this may provide the impetus to take the Footsie
above 2,900 again. But the big institutions are likely to remain wary if the
market moves to challenge the all-time peak of 2,957.3 achieved on March 8.
Prospects for the London stock market today will hang on the meeting at
mid-morning of the Bundesbank policy council, with the global money markets
likely to call the tune.

FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING optimism that a discount rate cut in Germany today would trigger one
in the UK tomorrow provided some invigoration for stock index futures,
Christine Buckley writes.
All expectation was directed towards today's meeting of the Bundesbank
council. This enabled the contract to push up through the 2,900 mark to
touch 2,910 around lunchtime.
However, it suffered an unsteady ride in late trading when it fell back to
2,888 after Wall Street's opening proved disappointing. But a rally brought
September back to the level at which it opened the day, closing at 2,894.
Volume, buoyed by the interest rate cut hopes, reached 10,631 contracts by
the end of the session.
However, with trading having been very lacklustre in previous sessions,
there was also an element of the contract moving back to a more even keel.
The closing level of the contract was about 5 points ahead of its fair value
premium to cash, which also stands at 5 points.
In the traded options market, there was also reasonable activity, with
volume reaching 32,702 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option was moderately traded
at 7,617 lots.
Storehouse was the most heavily traded of the stock options at 2,324 lots.
Asda came next at 1,763, followed by BAT Industries at 1,316.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Merck fall puts check on
advance by Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ENCOURAGING economic news failed to lift US stock markets yesterday as
declines in several big stocks, including Du Pont and Merck, left share
prices lower at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the end of a volatile day's trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average was
down 12.01 at 3,553.45. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped
1.05 to 447.19, although in the over-the-counter market the Nasdaq composite
rose 4.59 to 705.59. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 273m shares.
The day's economic news was broadly positive. The Commerce Department
announced a 3.8 per cent climb in June durable goods orders, an increase
three times larger than analysts had forecast. The figures, however, came
with a catch.
The big increase was due primarily to a jump in orders for commercial
aircraft, a traditionally volatile component. Without the aircraft orders,
the overall increase was just 0.3 per cent. Even so, analysts said that they
were still relieved to see that orders were up in June.
The news failed to lift market sentiment or prices, which tumbled at the
opening. Although some investors continued to take profits following recent
record highs for the Dow, the bulk of the decline was attributable to a
handful of leading stocks.
Merck led the way, falling almost Dollars 2 in early trading after the big
drugs group announced a Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment
Services, which will be funded through a new equity issue and debt
financing. Merck recovered some of its loss later in the day, and at the
close the stock was down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 3/4 after volume of
12.47m shares. Medco, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to
Dollars 34 1/8 .
Du Pont fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/4 after the company disappointed
the markets with second-quarter earnings of 76 cents a share, well below the
84 cents expected by analysts.
Chrysler dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 in turnover of 9.5m shares,
even though the car maker unveiled strong second-quarter net income of
Dollars 685m, which included one-off gains worth Dollars 110m from the sale
of stock and a plastics unit. The decline may have been a natural correction
following recent big gains in Chrysler's share price.
In the same sector, Ford Motor climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 in volume
of 2.1m shares on news of an impressive improvement in second-quarter
earnings. General Motors' class E shares, which represent the company's EDS
unit, advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 28 1/8 after the company, which
announced as-expected profits yesterday, said it expected double-digit
percentage revenue growth in 1993.
Eastman Kodak moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 after reporting
second-quarter net income of Dollars 1.13 a share, up from Dollars 1.11 a
year earlier, even after a special charge.
Canada
TORONTO continued to climb in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index finished
11.5 higher at 3,923.1 and rises led declines by 403 to 301 after volume of
52m shares valued at CDollars 569.5m.
Among the sub-indices, nine of the 14 gained ground. Golds recorded the
day's biggest change, rising 1.13 per cent.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Uncertain political
outlook leaves Nikkei edging lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING remained subdued by continuing political uncertainty, and share
prices were finally marginally lower after trading within a tight range,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 61.81 at 19,829.58 after a day's low of 19,792.68
and high of 19,958.00. With buying by public pension funds and investment
trusts absent, the index lost ground in tandem with the futures market.
Volume amounted to 180m shares, against Tuesday's 200m. Declines outnumbered
advances by 513 to 432, with 192 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks shed 3.17 to 1,622.28. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 1.32 to 1,231.85.
Traders feared that investors would remain inactive, using the political
situation as an excuse. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Even after
a new prime minister is chosen, investors may not want to trade until
policies are made by the cabinet.'
Investors have reacted calmly to the likelihood of a non-Liberal Democratic
Party coalition gaining power. The two splinter parties yesterday decided to
join the coalition formed by the five remaining opposition parties, giving
the opposition side a majority. Market participants are also focusing on the
next LDP president, who will be chosen tomorrow.
Some banks lost ground on profit-taking. Sakura Bank receded Y20 to Y1,640
and Fuji Bank lost Y20 to Y2,480. Brokers were also easier on fears of lower
profits due to the sharp fall in recent market volume. Daiwa Securities
weakened Y40 to Y1,280 and Nikko Securities shed Y20 to Y1,080.
Nomura Securities retreated Y20 to Y2,010. Investors were discouraged by
reports that it would bail out an ailing non-bank financial subsidiary.
Speculators took profits in Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day,
which relinquished Y1 to Y16.
Game makers firmed on hopes that new software would boost profits. Sega
Enterprises rose Y400 to Y10,700 and Namco Y140 to Y3,690.
Nippon Kayaku, a chemical maker, moved up Y5 to Y889 as investors were
encouraged by reports that the renovation of Sumitomo Chemical's epoxy resin
plant, which exploded earlier this month, would take longer than expected.
Sumitomo dipped Y5 to Y450 on expectations of a lower market share.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 21.33 to 21,926.24 in volume of 13.8m
shares. Nintendo rose Y330 to Y9,580.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets had a mostly restrained session.
HONG KONG finished moderately higher in selective trade as the market awaits
results from leading companies in the coming weeks. The Hang Seng index
advanced 37.24 to 6,903.21, after hitting an early low of 6,838.20. Turnover
shrank to HKDollars 2.3bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 2.9bn.
Sun Hung Kai Properties, the most active stock, put on 50 cents at HKDollars
36.75. It was followed by HSBC Holdings, which added HKDollars 1 at
HKDollars 73, and Guoco Group, which gained 90 cents at HKDollars 23. Last
week Guoco struck a deal to buy the Overseas Trust Bank from the government.
AUSTRALIA saw News Corp at the centre of attention on an otherwise subdued
day and the All Ordinaries index closed 3.5 firmer at 1,818.4.
News Corp climbed 19 cents to ADollars 8.49 with 6.5m shares traded after
its successful buy into Star TV, the Asian satellite broadcaster.
Turnover was boosted to ADollars 422m by heavy trading in several stocks.
Centro Properties, formerly Jennings Properties, topped turnover with about
87.9m shares changing hands, losing a cent to 56 cents as Fletcher Challenge
and Jennings Group sold their combined 35.9 per cent stake.
NEW ZEALAND gained 1.5 per cent in good volume, and the NZSE-40 capital
index finished 25.65 higher at a fresh three-year peak of 1,767.97.
Telecom, which reports first-quarter results today, gained 10 cents at
Dollars 3.46, up 61 per cent from a year ago.
MANILA was mixed after some late profit-taking but the composite index rose
2.59 to a new record of 1,740.97.
TAIPEI saw late nervous selling which left the weighted index 50.81, or 1.3
per cent, lower at 4,019.63 in moderate turnover of TDollars 17.41bn.
Tuesday's release of business indices indicating a possible slowdown had
hurt sentiment.
BOMBAY edged lower in thin trade as fears rose over Prime Minister PV
Narasimha Rao's government surviving a no-confidence vote in parliament
after the market had closed. The BSE index ended 10.89 down at 2,153.99.
SINGAPORE was left lower on selling in shipyards following weaker than
expected half-year earnings reported by Sembawang Shipyard. The Straits
Times Industrial index shed 11.32 to 1,794.21.
Sembawang Shipyard fell 50 cents to SDollars 11.60 in volume of 3.08m
shares, while its warrants dipped 50 cents to SDollars 5.70 on 563,000
shares traded.
