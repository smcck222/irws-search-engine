FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Market hopes rise for interest
rates cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BOURSES were mixed yesterday ahead of today's Buba meeting, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased in spite of a cut in the repo rate which may herald an
easing in interest rates today. The market is looking for a cut in the range
of 25-50 basis points.
However, Nikko Europe, expressing a widely held view, suggested that a cut
today would not be justified by monetary guidelines and could 'thus only be
in response to political pressures; and such a scenario would be found
prurient to many members of the policy-making council as an infringement of
a long-standing tradition of political independence'.
The DAX index lost 11.32 to 1,833.91 in turnover of DM7bn.
The car sector continued to feature after Volkswagen forecast earnings
recovery later in the year and the shares put on DM11.70 to DM359.70.
Elsewhere, Porsche gained DM9.20 to DM579 but Daimler fell back DM7.50 to
DM682.50.
PARIS drifted lower as the market marked time ahead of today's Buba meeting.
The CAC-40 index lost 8.58 to 1,989.53 in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
The market is also awaiting tomorrow's June unemployment figures which are
expected to show another rise, perhaps to 3.5m. Futures and options also
expire on Friday.
Elf Aquitaine attracted investor interest yesterday, the shares going
against the trend with a gain of FFr6.90 to FFr415.90, while Eurotunnel
built on Tuesday's gains, adding a further 70 centimes or 1.8 per cent to
FFr39.30.
AMSTERDAM gathered a little ground, the CBS Tendency index up 0.4 to 119.6.
Hoogovens gained Fl 1.70 to Fl 40.40 after a US steel ruling on anti-dumping
excluded hot-rolled steel.
MILAN quickly overcame some early nervousness in the wake of the overnight
bombing as the prospects for lower interest rates seemed more persuasive.
The Comit index edged 1.50 higher to 558.18.
Ferruzzi remained volatile in speculative trading, rising L32.5 or 7.7 per
cent to L454.
ZURICH was led higher by a strong banking sector, on expectations of strong
profits growth this year and the SMI index rose 10.3 to 2,408.8.
UBS bearers, the day's most active issue, gained SFr20 to SFr1,198 while SBC
bearers gained SFr15 to SFr487, helped by a warrant issue.
BRUSSELS was cautious ahead of the Bundesbank meeting and the Bel-20 index
edged 0.18 higher to 1,301.67. Cockerill Sambre, the steelmaker, rose BFr7
or 5.9 per cent to BFr125 in heavy trade as it caught up with gains
elsewhere in the sector.
VIENNA recovered some of its early losses and the ATX index closed down 6.65
at 969.47 after touching an early low of 955.56.
MADRID slipped off the day's highs after the emergence of profit-taking but
the general index posted a 1.52 rise to 263.87.
STOCKHOLM finished at a year's high with the Affarsvarlden index up 12.40 to
1,185.60 and the building and property sector some 4.3 per cent firmer.
HELSINKI's Hex index improved 2 per cent to 1,227.8 with interest mainly
concentrated on banks.
ISTANBUL corrected recent falls in technically inspired trading as the
composite index gained some 7 per cent to 9,714.90. Carnegie International
cautions against forecasts that the index will surge back to the 11-12,000
level since economic/politcal factors do not support a sustained rally.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Sharp setback in Turkey as Pakistan
rallies / Review activity in the world's emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT and FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp setback in Turkey last week contributed to a near 4 per cent decline
in the Europe/Mideast regional index of emerging markets.
The data, supplied by the IFC, a member of the World Bank, also shows that
Pakistan put on an impressive gain during the week in dollar terms, although
over the year to date its performance is less substantial.
Pakistani equities fell yesterday, ending the bullish fervour which began
with continued rises since the appointment on July 18 of a new interim
government.
The KSE-100 index on the Karachi stock exchange fell by 26.88, closing at
1,405.99.
That is still 125.25 points higher than the 1,280.74 closing index on July
19, the day before the beginning of the latest rises. Although many saw the
day's activity as a short-term interruption in rising trends, some were
confused as to whether the recent round of large profits was gradually
ending.
Mr Mudassir Malik, a director at BMA Capital Markets, said many stocks had
risen earlier with last week's devaluation of the Pakistani rupee. That had
created expectations of larger profits for export-oriented companies,
especially in the textile sector.
However, yesterday's falls were partially on account of adjustments for
industrial companies other than textiles whose shares had risen, without
realising that they were likely to face new pressures on account of higher
import bills for their inputs, he added.
A leading Karachi businessman said future trends will be set after Mr Moeen
Qureshi, the prime minister, returns from Washington at the end of this
week. Mr Qureshi is due to meet senior officials at the IMF and World Bank
to discuss Pakistan's external financing needs.
Pakistan has just completed a budgetary year with a record high deficit, and
the gov-ernment is under pressure from external donors to introduce measures
for tight fiscal controls, as a step to balance its books.
Elsewhere, Nomura's global strategists this week recommended a switch out of
south-east Asia into Mexico, thereby lifting their weighting in the latter
from 2 per cent to 5 per cent.
In explanation, Nomura's strategists, Nicholas Knight, Anthony Broccardo and
Allison Southey, refer to the combination of fundamentals  - less than 10
times 1993 earnings, potential catalyst for a sharp rise if the Nafta
negotiations are successful, and a sound technical position.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Critical day for the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK helped to ease intense strains inside the European exchange
rate mechanism yesterday after it cut the cost of lending short term funds
to commercial banks by a slightly larger sum than had been expected, writes
James Blitz.
The lowest accepted bid for 14-day funds in the Bundesbank's weekly money
market operation was 6.95 per cent, mildly beyond market expectations of a
cut to 7 per cent.
The move made a reduction in Germany's discount rate very likely at today's
council meeting, and helped to stop extraordinary falls in the values of the
peseta and escudo in early trading. Also, the French franc rose back above
the FFr3.40 level to the D-Mark and ended in London at FFr3.405, up from
Tuesday's FFr3.416 close.
But, in spite of yesterday's easing, there was uncertainty in the currency
market over what the Bundesbank must do today if it wants to bring the
crisis in the ERM to a halt.
Dealers in interest rate markets were anticipating a 50 basis-point cut in
the German discount rate today as a result of yesterday's move in the repo
rate. But now that this easing is priced into the market, some analysts are
uncertain over what its actual implementation will mean for the French
franc.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS in London, said the
Bundesbank would have to lower the discount rate by at least 75 basis points
today. Anything less could, in his view, trigger the collapse of the ERM.
The currency tension was all too clear yesterday morning after the peseta
and escudo moved with a volatility that was described by one analyst as
unprecedented.
After closing on Tuesday night at Pta80.89 per D-Mark, the Spanish currency
plummeted to an historic low of Pta82.30. The Portuguese escudo brushed its
ERM floor against the D-Mark, bottoming out at Es102.35.
Intervention by the Bank of Spain and the Bundesbank rate cut helped to
stabilise the Iberian currencies. The peseta finished at Pta80.41 against
the German currency.
Yesterday's tensions depressed the Belgian franc, forcing the authorities in
Belgium to intervene in support of the currency. It bottomed out at
BFr20.7710 to the D-Mark before ending at BFr20.66, above the previous day's
close of BFr20.72.
However, in the futures market it was striking that the implied annualised
volatility in the D-Mark/Belgian franc was at 7 per cent, having been at
0.25 percentage points only a few weeks ago. Dealers clearly took a dim view
of Belgium's commitment to keep the franc within  1/2 per cent fluctuations
against the German currency.
Sterling suffered another fall against the D-Mark following strong
speculation in interest rate markets that the UK could reduce base rates in
the next few weeks. The British currency closed at DM2.5675 from a previous
DM2.5700.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Money Markets: UK rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was strong speculation in sterling interest rate markets yesterday
that the UK authorities would cut base rates in the next few weeks, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
The speculation was partly fuelled by a belief that a cut in Germany's
discount rate this week would help the UK to ease monetary policy again.
A report from the Confederation of British Industry on Tuesday that UK
exports could have been hit by the higher sterling exchange rate in recent
months also added to speculation that the UK would want to try to bring down
the value of the pound.
'Most of the shift in expectations seems to have come directly from Tuesday
evening's news reports,' said one observer. 'Rates had got stuck at a level
which implied that cutting rates was a fairly free option, and now the
market has begun to concentrate harder on precisely when it will occur.'
Caught up most with the new mood was trading in sterling futures. The
September contract gained a full 18 basis points, closing at around 94.36,
while the December contract was similarly affected, ending 17 basis points
higher at 94.58.
However, some dealers felt that an early cut in base rates was hard to
envisage. 'If anything, the futures market has over-reacted,' said a London
analyst. 'Every piece of paper says that there will be a cut in rates around
budget time, not at the end of this week, but clearly a lot will depend on
events in Europe.'
At the short end, there was a lingering Pounds 2.25bn shortage, dispatched
by discount market operations throughout the day and a small amount of late
assistance from the Bank of England. Observers said the delay could be
traced to the 'wait and see' attitude of a number of players, pondering the
new thinking on UK interest rates. Overnight rates peaked at 7 3/4 per cent,
but later closed at around 6 per cent.
In Paris, developments in the French markets reflected the belief that a
German interest rate reduction at today's central bank council meeting,
combined with a significant domestic fiscal stimulus, might allow the French
franc to retain its parity for the rest of the summer.
Three-month French money market rates fell to around 8.25 per cent, down 100
basis points on the day. Trading in French franc futures was also affected,
with the September Pibor contract closing at 92.78, down two basis points
from the previous day, and the December contract ending 5 basis points lower
at 94.03.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farmers 'misled over
set-aside'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has misled member states and their farmers over the
timing of new rules governing land to be taken out of production under the
reformed common agricultural policy, UK farmers said yesterday.
Commission proposals on fixed areas of land that can be left fallow for five
years were due by the end of this month but failed to appear as expected on
the agenda at yesterday's meeting of EC commissioners, said Mr David Naish,
president of the National Farmers' Union.
'We are bitterly disappointed and frustrated at the lack of co-operation the
UK has received from the commission,' he said in a letter of protest to Mrs
Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister.
Farmers urgently needed to know details of the new scheme so that they could
plan their autumn crop planting, said Mr Naish, who accused the commission
of having little or no interest in providing the legislation.
'The delays in sorting out this issue also make nonsense of any attempt on
the part of farmers to manage the countryside and the land generally in an
environmentally beneficial way,' he said.
Farmers who left land fallow in the past five-year set-aside scheme, which
is just ending, were also anxious to know whether they will continue to be
paid to keep it all unplanted, he said. About 1,100 English farmers put
33,000 hectares into set-aside under the old programme.
Last year's CAP reforms introduced direct payments to arable farmers as
compensation for cuts in EC support prices, provided they set aside 15 per
cent of their land on a rotating basis.
But without the new rules, farmers may have to wait until the spring to sow,
achieving lower yielding, less profitable crops, the NFU said. The union
believes the proposals have become entangled in attempts by other member
states to reduce the length of the six-year scheme for rotating set-aside.
Meanwhile, Mrs Shephard yesterday announced a scheme to increase the
environmental benefits of the land taken out of production.
The minister said UK farmers would be able to apply for exemptions to the
set-aside rules to spare wildlife. She also outlined a plan for offering
farmers a series of options for managing non-rotational set-aside land in an
environmentally friendly way.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Miners unhappy with aboriginal
land decision

THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has moved to dampen a heated national
debate over native land claims, granting some rights to aborigines over
mining leases but overriding claims to residential and pastoral land,
reports Reuter from Canberra.
Special minister of state Mr Frank Walker, leading negotiations on the
issue, said the cabinet decision should allay aborigines' concerns over
mining on native lands.
'The government has decided that we will give aboriginal people the same
rights as everyone else in the community, a right to negotiate and then if
that doesn't work a tribunal who'll arbitrate,' Mr Walker said in a radio
interview.
The issue has flared up in the past few months following land claims by
aborigines on the basis of a landmark 1992 high court ruling that their
native title to Australia had not been extinguished by white settlement in
1788. As a result aborigines theoretically can lay claim to vast parts of
Australia, including prospective mining areas.
Mining industry leaders criticised the ruling and warned that it threatened
foreign investment.
The Australian Bankers' Association yesterday called for an end to
uncertainty over land title, saying its members were reluctant to lend to
businesses in areas subject to claims.
The compromise does not give aborigines a veto over mining on native lands
but the right to negotiate and refer disputes to a new tribunal, government
officials confirmed. But the government could still override a tribunal
decision if it was not regarded to be in the public interest, they added.
Mr Walker said that mining companies whose leases on native land expired
would also have to negotiate with aborigines to renew them.

GOLD and SILVER powered ahead in afternoon trade on the London bullion
market, largely ignoring the OTC options expiry but possibly reacting to
strong US economic figures, dealers said. Gold closed above Dollars 394 a
troy ounce after fixing at Dollars 393.15 in the afternoon, up from a
morning fix of Dollars 391.80. Earlier it was announced US durable goods
orders rose 3.8 per cent in June, the biggest gain since December. and well
above the average forecast 1 per cent. 'The options were all covered, so it
must have been the economic data which caused the buying,' one dealer said.
BASE METAL trading was slow on the LME, and minimal interest was seen,
although most markets ended steadier as sentiment showed signs of becoming
more positive. COPPER continued to pay little heed to fundamentals, which
are hardly supportive at present. Instead, the market again pushed higher
against a background of a developing squeeze between September and early
October. Chicago SOYABEAN were falling at midsession, under pressure from
warmer and drier weather in the western US Midwest.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Feathered herds give
heavyweight profits - The rapid growth of US ostrich ranching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVOLUTION DEALT the ostrich a mixed hand. The world's largest, presumably
oldest and certainly moodiest bird boasts a protective hide covered with
motley coloured feathers, carries around 300lb of red meat and lays
delicious eggs. Such impressive physical endowment has, unfortunately for
the earth-bound avian, great commercial value.
African farmers have long realised the birds' potential. But in the US only
recently have ostriches become a hot commodity. In fact, the US supply for
this alternative cash crop remains solely in the hands of breeders, who sell
the birds at inflated prices to satisfy demand.
Since ostriches were first introduced from South Africa in the mid-1980s the
number of ranchers raising them has grown to about 3,000.
The ranches are usually small, but surprisingly profitable. An adult pair,
which can produce between 30 and 120 eggs per year, now carries a Dollars
60,000 price tag, which is still rising quickly. Two yearlings can be bought
for about Dollars 12,000 to Dollars 15,000 and chicks, which require much
care, are a bargain at Dollars 3,000 each. No wonder many Americans with a
backyard and a high fence have at least mulled over this investment.
Mr Howard W. 'Bud' Kerr Jr., who runs the one-man (no window) small-scale
farming office at the sprawling US Department of Agriculture, says he gets
as many as 30 inquiries about ostriches each week.
At the Circle M Ranch in south-west Missouri, Mr Bob McKean has been raising
ostriches since 1986, when he bought his first pair for only Dollars 8,000.
He now owns 35 birds, quite a lot by present standards, which are raised on
a 75ft by 120ft plot.
Many such breeding ranches are run across the country's farm belt,
especially in Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri.
It is not clear when the demand will be satisfied, though estimates range
from five to ten years. Other large-scale agricultural commodities like
Angus cattle and the Texas longhorn also were launched by a breeder's
market.
The ostriches' potential under normal market conditions has not been
questioned. The bird has many uses.
Ostrich flesh, already used to make jerky in Africa, caters to the demand
for low fat and low cholesterol meat. Large-scale slaughter has not begun,
but the meat, now taken from sterile birds, sells for Dollars 6 to Dollars
10 a pound. Health-conscious California has been cited as a possibly fertile
future market.
The black, blue and white feathers, which on the European market bring
Dollars 50 to Dollars 1,000 a pound, are used in feather dusters, fashion
accessories, theatre costumes and pens. This is a renewable resource; an
ostrich can be deplumed twice a year.
But perhaps most coveted is the hide, used to make boots and brief cases.
Tanned hides bring Dollars 30 to Dollars 50 a sq ft while custom 'full
quill' boots can cost as much as Dollars 2,000.
Starting an ostrich farm is easy, farmers say. An estimated 2,000 birds are
needed to turn a profit under normal market conditions. For now, however, an
operation even smaller than Mr McKean's can do the trick.
The birds, unlike cattle, need little space and eat little. They usually
live for around 70 years and most of them are fertile. 'They're just large
chickens,' says Mr Ronald Mascher, who publishes the Small Farm Today
magazine.
But they are probably not as smart. Owners warn that the birds must be
trained and handled carefully because, with a brain barely bigger than a
peanut, the ostrich has an impulsive character.
The birds do not stick their heads in the sand to avoid danger - a terribly
damning myth, ostrich owners lament - but they are prone to unrelenting
pecking, running around at speeds in excess of 45 mph and generating enough
force with their two-toed feet to, in the words of one expert, 'disembowel a
lion'.
There are other problems. Chicks often have a high mortality rate, usually a
consequence of indigestion or inclement weather; the market for many ostrich
products, particularly meat, remains untested; and prices are highly
volatile.
Volatility may not be such a drawback, however, as US farmers are well known
for having a strong speculative streak.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Africans abandon reserve on
gold hedging - Miners have made more forward sales than many thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL RECENTLY South African mining houses had an almost theological view of
gold. There was no such thing as a pricing policy - you were simply expected
to believe in the metal and the price would inevitably rise. In the words of
one industry newcomer: 'You were supposed to leave the marketing to God'.
In consequence, compared to North American and Australian producers, South
Africans remain novices at gold hedging. They have, however, progressed well
beyond theology as was revealed in a blast of glasnost last week when
producers, celebrating the recent rise in the metal price, stumbled over
each other in the rush to release details of their forward positions.
Anglo American, the world's largest producer, released details of its
forwards sales for the first time, as did its associate Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments. Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group, also
offered more detail than in the past about its forward sales strategy.
The picture that emerges is that South Africa is selling forward more gold
than many thought: in the year to June 1994, about 173kg (the figure is not
precise as Randgold does not publicise the extent of its forward sales) or
28 per cent of production, which is on course for about 617 tonnes in 1993.
The broad picture, however, disguises some significant divergences between
the different mining houses in terms of strategy. Some are clear winners and
some equally obvious losers, with the associated rewards and penalties
considerable.
A variety of reasons were put forward for the improved disclosure. Foremost
among these was shareholder pressure, cited both by Mr Kennedy Maxwell at
JCI and Mr Gary Maude at Gengold. Mr Maxwell said that with the recent
reversal in the price trend, investors were very anxious to know the extent
to which various mines were exposed to the spot price.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division, cited two
different reasons: that the company had achieved the aims of its hedging
policy; and that it was no longer active in the market (and hadn't been
since April).
The aim of the policy, said Mr Sunter, was to keep marginal mining areas at
full production. That the policy has worked is illustrated by the fact that
Anglo is producing more gold than three years ago, while its workforce has
shrunk by only 7,000 out of a total of 180,000, the sort of social
commitment the group is anxious to make.
According to Mr Sunter, Anglo's hedging policies secured 110 tonnes of
annual production, worth R4.4bn at present prices, saving 70,000 jobs in the
process. About 50 tonnes of this comes from marginal areas and the other 60
tonnes from major capital projects that the group was able to proceed with
because hedging helped keep suitable tax shields in place.
Others had even more basic reasons to hedge. Mr Gary Maude, managing
director of Gengold, notes that they hedged in order to survive. He notes
that in September 1992, most of the group's production was in the
R26,000-R33,000 (Pounds 3,900-Pounds 4,900) a kilogram cost bracket compared
with a price of R31,383 a kilogram.
'We had very, very good reasons to protect ourselves,' he says. 'We're
hedging to stay in business, not to make extra income.'
Hedging, of course, is a double-edged sword. The price of securing insurance
against lower prices is missing out on the potential bonanza should prices
rise sharply, as they have recently - from about R32,000 to R42,000 a
kilogram in three months. Mr Maude is thus painfully aware that, at current
gold prices, earlier hedging is actually denying them extra income. Gengold
concedes, for example, that hedging depressed its profits in the June
quarter by about a third compared with what they would have made receiving
the spot price.
Arguably those like Gengold - Randgold, the gold arm of the Rand Mines
group, is another - who came fairly late to hedging have been doubly hurt.
First, when cost pressures really started to weigh on the industry in about
1990, they missed out on the opportunity to lock in more favourable prices.
Now, they find themselves having hedged large portions of their production
at prices well below the present market level.
The consequences of these decisions are considerable. While Anglo is able to
boast about hedging helping to protect jobs, Gengold has seen its workforce
shrink to 49,000 from 90,000 in 1989. At Harmony, the largest Randgold mine,
the workforce is down to 14,500 from 29,000 three years ago. At the very
least, had these groups pursued hedging earlier, it is likely their job
losses would have been less and the financial state of their mines would
probably have been better.
That, however, is water under the bridge. What to do in future again
presents agonising dilemmas, especially given the recent surge in the gold
price. Excellent prices can be locked in now - R52,000 a kilogram for a sale
two years out - but this has to be set against the possibility of a genuine
bull market developing. All that can be said with certainty is that heated
debates are under way in the various mining houses about appropriate
strategy.
Both Anglo and Gengold have said they have stopped selling forward, but will
continue to watch the market for pricing opportunities. In terms of
strategy, Mr Maude says Gengold will in future use hedging to provide
insurance against downside in the price as opposed to merely securing
survival.
Hedging aside, one sure trend in the months ahead is that the mines will
take the opportunity offered by the higher gold price to access more
marginal ore bodies, saving the higher grade deposits against the return of
tougher times. Development work at the mines will thus be increased
vigorously to reach these lower grade ore bodies, allowing mines more
production flexibility and ultimately prolonging their life expectancies.
Mining lower grades, however, will push up unit costs and keep a damper on
profit margins. But for mines that until recently were struggling to show
any profit margin at all, that is the sort of problem they can live with.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers meet to thrash
out cartel details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN coffee producers today begin a two-day meeting in Rio de
Janeiro to thrash out details of the exporters' cartel through which they
hope to drive up prices from the present depressed level.
They have already succeeded in lifting world market values from the recent
20-year lows by agreeing to withhold 20 per cent of scheduled shipments.
Today's gathering will define the statutes, location and budget of the new
producers' association. This is intended to fill the gap left by the
collapse in July 1989 of the export quota system operated by the
International Coffee Organisation, following which world prices, already
depressed at the time, slumped by another 60 per cent.
Delegates at this week's meeting will also consider the price level at which
stocks would be released to the market. Mr Jair Coser, president of the
Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters, has suggested that it could be
between 80 and 90 US cents a pound, a range reported to be favoured by
Colombian producers.
That target is modest compared with the Dollars 1.20 to Dollars 1.40 range
the ICO, a producer-consumer group, was attempting to defend until 1989.
The Brazilian private sector has proposed that the amount retained be
reduced to 10 per cent if the price rebounds partially, but that idea was
given a lukewarm response when put on Tuesday to Mr Jose Eduardo de Andrade
Vieira, minister of industry and commerce, according to Mr Coser.
However, Brazilian officials, influential in negotiations because they
represent the world's biggest exporter, appear to be keeping an open mind.
'The possibility exists' of a trigger scheme, said Mr Gilson Ximenes,
director of the National Coffee Department of the ministry.
The Rio de Janeiro meeting is a lead up to a gathering of all of the world's
major coffee exporters scheduled for August 16-17 in Uganda. The final
accord is scheduled be signed September 16 in Brasilia and retention
initiated in October.
Discussions on a producers' association to regulate stocks and try to boost
international prices began after the collapse earlier this year of talks
aimed at revitalising the ICO.
Individual countries are already outlining domestic retention schemes, which
the cartel is likely to police with the help of an international auditing
firm.

Australia and elsewhere, following a currency revaluation. This helped to
bring out more business from other wool buyers. European interest rate
reductions are seen as helpful especially if they lead to improved trading

FT  29 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: European sector anticipates German
official rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by the Bundesbank to reduce its repo rate by 20 basis points to
6.95 per cent convinced international government bond markets that German
official rates would be cut today.
Reflecting concern over economic credibility, long-dated German government
bonds fell back, while short-term prices, which signpost interest rate
moves, held firm. Meanwhile, French government bond prices held steady and
Italian paper rose on switching from the German market.
Economists had expected a fall of between 10 and 15 basis points in the
German repo to just above 7 per cent following the level that overnight
money had reached previously.
However, there was so much liquidity in the market following the heavy
foreign exchange intervention to support the French franc over recent days
that the Bundesbank had to offer a lower rate to the commercial banks as an
incentive to bid for loans.
By the close last night there was a consensus that the council will announce
a half-point cut in the 6.75 per cent discount rate which sets the floor for
German lending, and the same amount for the Lombard rate, which sets the
ceiling.
Any reduction would be contrary to the Bundesbank's stated policy of holding
rates high in the face of inflationary pressures. Consequently, it could
dent the bank's economic credibility and affect sentiment in long-dated
bunds which is relatively closely bound up with confidence in sound economic
policies.
The September 10-year bund futures contract traded on Liffe fell 30 pfennigs
to 95.90, while short-dated paper was steady.
Meanwhile, the 10-year Notionell future for September eased only 2 centimes
from Tuesday's close to 120.18 and was trading higher after the official
close.
However, the strongest potential for further easing was considered to be
outside the ERM and the Italian September futures contract traded on Liffe
jumped nearly half a point from 104.57 to 104.92.
THE SUCCESS of the latest Pounds 3.25bn auction for UK government bonds
surprised most participants and provided an opportunity for the gilts market
to continue its upward momentum.
September gilt futures shot forward by more than a per centage point to 109
1/32 before retreating in the face of profit-takers to close nearly half a
point up at 108 7/16 .
The government auction of 7 per cent stock maturing in 2001 was covered 2.29
times against expectations of between one and two times and against the
miserable cover of 1.1 times at the last big auction a month ago. The stock
was placed at an average accepted price of 97 3/16 , giving a yield of 7.46
per cent.
The cover partly reflected the fact that dealers had positioned themselves
better this time and the relevant section of the yield curve had fallen
acceptably ahead of the auction. More significantly, there was no tail - the
gap between the lowest accepted bid price and the average bid price - which
pointed to very fierce bidding. It appears that US funds bought heavily
against expectations that an eight-year maturity would be shunned by
overseas buyers who prefer 10-year stocks.
US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday following a strong
afternoon auction of five-year notes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 106
3/32 , yielding 6.648 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.201 per cent.
Prices opened lower, primarily because of the announcement of a 3.8 per cent
rise in June durable goods orders, an increase that was three times as large
as market forecasts. The goods orders data is notoriously volatile, however,
and analysts pointed out that if commercial aircraft orders were excluded,
the rise was only 0.3 per cent.
Consequently, prices gradually recovered their lost ground, and by late
morning had edged into positive territory. Hopes that the afternoon sale of
the Dollars 11bn five-year notes would go well was also behind the market's
recovery. Those hopes were met when the auction was completed amid strong
demand. The longer end posted further gains later in the day after the White
House confirmed that President Clinton was considering cutting back spending
on government entitlements as part of his deficit-reduction drive.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE draws up stock-index
futures rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo stock exchange has drafted new restrictions for the stock-index
futures market in an attempt to end criticism of the negative effects of
futures and options trading.
The measures are seen as the final round of reforms to end a long-standing
row over derivatives trading, which Japan's financial regulators believe to
be the leading cause of the weakness of the Tokyo stock market.
The ministry of finance last December called for a reform of the stock
futures market, including a review of trading restrictions. However, many
futures traders see such reforms as long overdue. The number of market
participants in Japan's derivatives market has declined sharply due to the
spate of restrictions already implemented over the past two years.
The TSE's draft includes the introduction of a circuit breaker mechanism to
suspend transactions when prices swing wildly, and more disclosure
requirements. Initial plans intended to prevent 'front running', or trading
of stocks by brokers ahead of clients' orders, were postponed.
A separate group of Osaka and Tokyo stock exchange members are currently
working on a new stock index for futures, which is expected to be announced
later this year. The ministry of finance called for a capitalisation
weighted average to replace the current Nikkei 225, which is a simple price
average of 225 stocks and is criticised as being easily manipulated.
Details and the timing of implementation have yet to be decided, but the
TSE's proposal includes the following measures:
Implementation of a circuit breaker mechanism, suspending futures and
options trading for 15 minutes when prices fluctuate beyond a designated
range;
Suspension of arbitrage linked cash trading if the futures index rises or
falls to the daily limit;
Disclosure of futures trading by brokers' own accounts and client orders;
Daily disclosure of outstanding arbitrage linked cash positions of brokers'
own account trading and client orders.

government's return to the market with a Dollars 150m issue in February.
An expected Dollars 100m issue of three-year Eurobonds by Philippine
Airlines (PAL) early next month will be followed by deals for the Philippine
National Oil Company and the National Power Corporation.
The PAL deal, arranged by Chemical Bank, is likely to be priced to yield 350
to 400 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield.
State-owned Philippine National Oil is planning to launch a Dollars 60m
five-year deal via J P Morgan in September, and the National Power
Corporation is set to launch a Dollars 150m five-year issue via Morgan
Stanley the following month.
Reports on Reuter that the International Monetary Fund had warned the
Philippines against borrowing heavily in the Eurobond market were taken out
of context, an IMF official in Washington said. He said the IMF has welcomed
the Philippines' return to capital markets, provided they pursued a cautious
approach.
Activity in the Eurobond market yesterday was concentrated in dollars and
yen. However, Euroyen offerings totalling Y60bn were pre-placed with
investors in the eastern Asia, dealers said.
Two floating-rate note issues, aimed at different groups of investors, were
launched in the dollar sector. CSFB Finance launched a Dollars 50m issue of
10-year collared floating-rate notes, with a maximum coupon of 9 1/2 per
cent and a minimum coupon of 5 1/2 per cent, which met strong demand from
retail investors.
Gota Bank, the Swedish bank which was rescued by the government in December
1992, launched a Dollars 100m issue of step-up floating rate notes via
Chemical Bank.
Like a number of other Swedish banks involved in last year's bail-out, it is
now legally backed by the government.
Another Swedish bank, the Urban Mortgage Bank, recently completed a similar
deal in the private placement market.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S first auction of three-year government bonds following government
moves earlier this month to allow the remit of capital and interest earnings
has failed to attract investors from abroad, writes Christopher Bobinski in
Warsaw.
Domestic interest in the issue was also weak, with the government offering
800bn zlotys of bonds and the banks willing to take up 90bn zlotys worth.
Eventually, 60bn zlotys worth were placed at a 1.9 per cent discount on the
nominal value. The three-year bonds carry an interest rate which reflects
three-month Treasury bill yields plus 10 per cent.
The government had hoped the three-year bond issue, which is earmarked for
funding this year's 81,000bn zloty budget deficit, would attract foreign
funds. However, currency fears have evidently kept foreign investors away.

<TEXT>
MR David Mullins, vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, yesterday
told international swap and derivatives dealers that proper supervision of
the derivatives industry would require far more than the status quo. His was
the first official reaction by the US central bank to the Group of 30 report
on derivatives issued in London last week.
Mr Mullins, speaking to the International Swap and Derivatives Association
meeting in New York, said: 'The report's statement that the existing
regulatory framework is adequate does not appear to be derived from or
supported by an extensive analysis of the full range of public policy issues
associated with derivatives activities.'
He added that while the G30 report helped to clarify understanding of the
new financial instruments, their complexity and diversity made their
measurement and control more important than was the case with traditional
shares and bonds. Systemic risks from derivatives were often overstated, he
said, but the report did not offer insights that would 'alter estimates of
the probability of a systemic disturbance or of its potential costs.'
Mr Mullins criticised the G30 for not addressing the need to follow-up its
recommendations to derivatives practitioners.

red
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORANDA, the big Canadian resource group, has run into the red with a
first-half loss of CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.4m), or 32 cents a share,
against profits of CDollars 49m, or 10 cents, last time, writes Robert
Gibbens.
The group has been hit by declining commodity prices and a CDollars 30m
charge on the sale of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel.
Revenues were CDollars 2.6bn, down from CDollars 4.3bn, reflecting the
MacMillan Bloedel disposal.
The second-quarter loss this year equalled 7 cents a share against a profit
of 9 cents. The lower Canadian dollar and lower interest expense partly
offset weak prices for metals, papers and oil and gas.
The sale of the MacMillan stake has reduced Noranda's long-term debt to
CDollars 2.9bn.

<TEXT>
IMASCO, the Canadian financial services, tobacco and food retailing group in
which BAT Industries of the UK has a 40 per cent stake, reports slow
second-quarter profits following a reduced contribution from financial
services.
There was a continued recovery in the US fast-food business and better
results from tobacco products and drug stores, but net income for the
quarter could only emerge at CDollars 94.8m (USDollars 74m), or 74 cents a
share, against CDollars 94.6m, or 73 cents, a year earlier.
Net revenues for the quarter were little changed at CDollars 2bn. First-half
earnings were CDollars 161.3m, or CDollars 1.24, up 2 per cent from CDollars
158.2m, or CDollars 1.21. Six-month net revenues showed little movement at
CDollars 3.9bn.
Mr Purdy Crawford, chairman, said the Canada Trust operations maintained a
high level of provision in the six months, despite improving credit
conditions and a decline in overall non-performing loans.
Retail banking results were good but Canadian demand for home mortgages
remained soft.
Prospects for the current half and 1994 had improved but the financial
services unit's contribution to Imasco's 1993 earnings will not match 1992.
Imperial Tobacco's share of the domestic cigarette market rose to 66.9 per
cent and its share of the export market is being regained. Hardee's Food
Systems is controlling costs well, maintaining margins and continuing to
recover, said Mr Crawford.
The drug store subsidiary maintained growth in a very competitive market.
BCE, the telecommunications group which owns 52 per cent of Northern
Telecom, plans to sell its fully-owned Case-Hoyt printing unit in the US to
Avanti Press, a Miami-based graphic arts company. The price was not
disclosed.
BCE bought Case-Hoyt as part of a major diversification into commercial
printing in 1984. Since then it has divested the other printing units.
Case-Hoyt has annual sales of USDollars 60m and is profitable.
BCE's non-telecom interests are now confined to property group, BF Realty,
and its Montreal Trust financial services unit which has assets in excess of
CDollars 50bn.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the biggest US brewer, yesterday posted essentially flat
second-quarter net income on sales which edged 1.3 per cent higher and said
it would raise its quarterly dividend by 12.5 per cent.
For the 1993 second quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 308.6m on
sales of Dollars 3.43bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 308.4m on sales
of Dollars 3.38bn a year earlier. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 4.7
per cent to Dollars 1.11 from Dollars 1.06. There were fewer shares
outstanding in the latest quarter.
The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend on common
stock to 36 cents a share from 32 cents.
For the first half, the company had net income of Dollars 502.7m, or Dollars
1.80 on sales of Dollars 6.3bn. A year earlier, Anheuser-Busch earned
Dollars 446.8m, or Dollars 1.54, in the first six months on sales of Dollars
6.41bn. Last year's earnings included charges of Dollars 76.7m for
accounting changes.
During the second quarter, the company's market share rose to 41.9 per cent
compared with 41.6 per cent a year ago.

in first half

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, said its BFr5.72bn (Dollars 148m)
half-year consolidated loss was mainly due to restructuring charges, a
plunge in profits in plastics and competition from cheaper European imports,
Reuter reports from Brussels.
The loss included an extraordinary charge of more than BFr3bn. This came
mainly from provisions, depreciation charges and costs linked to
restructuring operations, including the closure of two soda ash plants in
Couillet, Belgium, and Heilberonn, Germany.
In the first-half of 1992, Solvay's BFr5.88bn consolidated net profit
included an extraordinary profit of about BFr1bn.
Solvay said the first-half 1993 deficit before extraordinary items was due
mainly to heavy losses in its plastics sector which were not compensated by
earnings in its four other sectors.
'Plastics prices have collapsed. The situation is extremely difficult,' said
Mr Daniel Janssen, chairman of Solvay's executive committee, at a news
conference.
He added that these problems were due to excessive production capacity in
western Europe and cheap imports from eastern Europe.
Mr Janssen said second-half 1993 earnings should improve, particularly in
the group's troubled plastics sector. He said there would be no
extraordinary charges in the second half.
'Second-half earnings will improve but we will definitely not make a
BFr5.7bn profit to compensate for the first half loss,' Mr Janssen said.
In Solvay's peroxygens sector, the group performance in the US and
Scandinavia had not offset a slump in earnings in the other European
countries.
In the processing sector, sales and earnings were down, with earnings
particularly badly hit in industrial film production. Sales rose in the
health sector but earnings were slightly lower while Solvay's
anti-depressant Fluvoxamine was performing well.
Mr Janssen said the health sector had seen strong growth in the US.

MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, yesterday
reported a 26 per cent increase in fourth-quarter net income, helped by its
Microsoft Windows operating system.
It reported net income of Dollars 265m, or 87 cents a share, compared to
Dollars 210m, or 71 cents, in the fourth quarter of last year.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.04bn - its first billion dollar quarter -
compared to Dollars 815m a year ago.
The results were in line with market expectations but came after the close
of the Nasdaq market on which Microsoft is quoted.
For the full year, Microsoft made net income of Dollars 953m, up 35 per cent
from the Dollars 708m of 1992, while earnings per share totalled Dollars
3.15, against Dollars 2.41. Revenues totalled Dollars 3.75bn, up 36 per cent
from 1992's Dollars 2.76bn.
Mr Mike Brown, vice-president of finance, noted that net income equalled
25.4 per cent of revenues in fiscal 1993.
Mr Bill Gates, chairman, said: 'Throughout the year the adoption of the
Microsoft Windows operating system worldwide has been a major part of our
success. Microsoft has distributed more than 30m copies of Windows and
continues to distribute more than 1m copies a month.'
He said the company was making long-term investments in technologies
including software for office machines and personal home devices.

SUN Microsystems, the US computer group, exceeded market expectations as it
reported that net income in the last quarter of its financial year to the
end of June was more than double the level of a year ago, but warned that
recession in Europe would harm results for the current quarter.
'While weak economies in Europe and other international markets pose a
significant challenge for our first fiscal quarter and could exacerbate the
normal summer seasonal weakness, our product lines are in an excellent
position,' said Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer.
Turnover climbed 30 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn, during the three months to
the end of June, from Dollars 972m in the same period in 1992.
The system software company sold 140,000 software product licences, while
Sun Microsystems Computer shipped a record 71,000 computer systems and
92,000 processors.
Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 76.1m, or 72 cents a share, from
Dollars 37.7m, or 37 cents a year ago.
For the financial year, net income slipped to Dollars 156.7m from Dollars
173.3m on turnover of Dollars 4.3bn up from Dollars 3.6bn.
Mr Melia said headway had been made in bringing costs under control.
Operating expenses as a proportion of total revenue were 5 1/2 percentage
points lower in the fourth quarter than a year before.

better-than-expected 19.7 per cent increase in real terms compared to the
same period last year, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Maseca is one of Mexico's largest consumer food companies, and the biggest
seller of corn flour, out of which is made the tortilla. It is currently
expanding capacity, having just opened a new plant in Guadalajara, Mexico's
second largest city. Maseca's margins also increased from 14.3 per cent to
16.25 per cent in the second quarter.

DIE ERSTE Oesterreichische Spar-Casse Bank said its operating profit in the

Mr Konrad Fuchs, chief executive, said negotiations aimed at restructuring
Austria's savings bank sector, in which Erste is playing a leading role,

Philippine Airlines

<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE Airlines, the national airline which was privatised at the
beginning of 1992, reports reduced profits for the year to March 1993
following a steep increase in depreciation charges.
Net income for the year dipped by close to 8 per cent to 1.03bn pesos
(Dollars 37.6m) from the previous year. Revenues moved ahead marginally to
24.43bn pesos, against 24.41bn pesos last time.
Philippine Airlines said earnings would have been higher but for heavier
depreciation which for last year took in depreciation on appraisal
increments. Without this, profits would have been some 40 per cent higher,
the company said. Expenses amounted to 23.01bn pesos, up 9 per cent. This,
together with the higher depreciation charge, left operating profits
flagging badly at 1.41bn pesos - down 57 per cent on 1991-92.
The airline's assets at the end of March totalled 24.19bn pesos, up 21.5 per
cent. Total liabilities were 33 per cent higher at 13.44bn pesos. The
airline said its net worth grew over the year by 12.5 per cent to 9.15bn
pesos.
During the year Philippine Airlines pushed through a reorganisation which
reduced the par value of its shares from 10 pesos to 5 pesos. The airline
said the move helped wipe out accumulated deficits of 5bn pesos.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sale charge and falling prices
push Noranda into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORANDA, the big Canadian resource group, has run into the red with a
first-half loss of CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.4m), or 32 cents a share,
against profits of CDollars 49m, or 10 cents, last time.
The group has been hit by declining commodity prices and a CDollars 30m
charge on the sale of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel. Revenues
were CDollars 2.6bn, down from CDollars 4.3bn, reflecting the MacMillan
Bloedel disposal.
The second-quarter loss this year equalled 7 cents a share against a profit
of 9 cents. The lower Canadian dollar and lower interest expense partly
offset weak prices for metals, papers and oil and gas.
The sale of the MacMillan stake has reduced Noranda's long-term debt to
CDollars 2.9bn.
Loblaw, Canada's biggest grocer, had a second-quarter profit of CDollars
24.3m, or 28 cents a share, up from CDollars 10.8m, or 11 cents. Sales were
CDollars 2.16bn, against CDollars 2.12bn. Price competition in western
Canada and a US strike hurt results.
Torstar, the publishing group, earned CDollars 2.6m, or 6 cents a share, in
the second quarter, down from CDollars 12.6m, or 31 cents. Revenues were
CDollars 229m, against CDollars 218m. A weak advertising market adversely
affected the Toronto Star newspaper, while books improved slightly.
Fletcher Challenge Canada earned CDollars 6.1m, or 5 cents a share, in the
fourth-quarter to end-June, against a loss of CDollars 20.1m, or 30 cents, a
year earlier. For all 1993, FCC made a loss of CDollars 24.2m, against a
loss of CDollars 43.5m, on revenues up 28 per cent at CDollars 1.23bn.
Falconbridge, Canada's second biggest nickel producer, has sold its 62 per
cent control of Falconbridge Gold, its remaining gold mining subsidiary, for
CDollars 22m. The buyer is Kinross Gold, a new Toronto mining group, for
CDollars 22m. With the deal go producing mines in Zimbabwe and at Timmins in
northern Ontario.
Kinross is buying 8.2m Falconbridge gold common shares and a CDollars 7.4 m
convertible debenture. Kinross is 25 per cent held by Placer Dome and 23.5
per cent by Dundee Bankcorp. The two companies will have 1993 gold
production of about 150,000 oz.
Kinross has said it would like to buy the remaining 38 per cent of
Falconbridge Gold.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, yesterday posted disappointing
second-quarter figures, with declining underlying earnings from all of its
main businesses except petroleum.
In the three months to June 30, the group had net income of Dollars 516m, or
76 cents a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 277m, or 41 cents, in
the same period of 1992. Stripping out one-time items in both years,
earnings rose 11 per cent in the quarter.
On Wall Street, shares in Du Pont closed down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 52
3/8 . Analysts had expected earnings of abut 84 cents a share.
Mr Edgar Wollard, chairman, said that without an increase in economic
activity 'business conditions are likely to remain difficult, with excess
capacity and resultant downward price pressures in our major markets.'
Petroleum earnings, excluding non-recurring charges, soared 155 per cent to
Dollars 199m in the quarter.
The growth in income reflected higher natural gas prices, lower exploration
and other costs and stronger upstream earnings on new oil and gas production
outside the US.
The chemical division's earnings fell 4 per cent to Dollars 91m, largely due
to lower earnings for white pigments and specialty chemicals.
Fibre earnings declined 27 per cent to Dollars 107m, while polymer division
earnings were 14 per cent lower at Dollars 107m. The diversified businesses
unit saw earnings drop 15 per cent to Dollars 151m, stripping out a
non-recurring charge in 1992.
For the first half, Du Pont earned Dollars 1bn, or Dollars 1.49. A year
earlier, the company took accounting charges of Dollars 4.8bn which
contributed to a net loss of Dollars 4.12bn, or Dollars 6.13.
Excluding non-recurring items, earnings rose 15 per cent in the first six
months of 1993.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: UNP setting its sights on pole
position - Canadian group has spent CDollars 9m on former Polish state
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN International UNP Holdings was a junior exploration group on the
Vancouver stock exchange, the abbreviation in its name stood for United
Northern Petroleum. Mr George Bonar, UNP's chairman and chief executive, now
mischievously tells inquirers the initials come from three Polish words
meaning 'beloved new Poland'.
The remark is only half in jest. UNP has emerged from obscurity on Canada's
west coast to become an active western investor in Poland.
It has spent CDollars 9m (USDollars 7m) over the past two years buying
control of three privatised Polish companies: Ibis, the country's biggest
maker of bakery equipment; BIAWAR, the leading manufacturer of hot-water
heaters; and Unipak (formerly GNIEZNO), the dominant maker of packaging
equipment. In each case, the remaining shares continue to be held by the
state.
UNP, which recently moved its head office from Toronto to London, aims to
negotiate about four new investments a year as the privatisation of Polish
state-owned enterprises proceeds. Mr Bonar has his eye on makers of
clothing, building materials and food processing machinery, among others.
He is also setting up a partnership with Murray Johnstone, the Scottish fund
managers, to manage investment trusts with interests in privatised Polish
companies.
UNP is listed on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. It is thinly
traded because 92 per cent of its stock is held by 24 blue-chip
institutional investors in North America and Europe. Led by JP Morgan (which
has put in CDollars 5m) and Morgan Stanley, they have contributed a total of
CDollars 27m in capital.
Another equity issue, which Mr Bonar hopes will bring in CDollars 5m to
CDollars 10m from six more institutions, is in progress.
UNP's prospects depend heavily on Mr Bonar's ability to spot sound
investments among Poland's state-owned enterprises, then to negotiate their
privatisation and turn them into market-driven companies.
Mr Bonar, who was born in Poland and speaks the language, was formerly chief
executive of Eldorado Nuclear, a Canadian uranium processing company. Before
that, he was in charge of marketing at Falconbridge, the international
nickel producer.
Mr Bill James, his former boss at Falconbridge, remembers Mr Bonar as a
'pretty shrewd guy'. Another former colleague says the expansive Mr Bonar,
now 59, left Falconbridge after disagreements over his ambitious plans for
the marketing department. 'He was maybe too innovative,' the ex-colleague
says.
UNP has set its sights on a group of between 4,000 and 6,000 mid-sized
manufacturers which have been neglected in the stampede by foreign and
domestic investors for a slice of the Polish privatisation pie.
Mr Bonar is adamant he will not - at least for the time being - become
involved in competitive bidding for state-owned enterprises. 'If I find
competition, I walk,' he says. 'I don't need to buy the company that makes
cups and saucers. I can get the company that makes spoons.'
This, he says, explains why UNP has so far paid a modest multiple of 1.5
times pre-tax cash-flow for its investments.
Its targets are the less glamorous companies with fewer than 1,000 workers,
high labour content, low brand visibility, and with little dependence on
high-technology. But, like the three which UNP has bought so far, they are
likely to have a dominant market share.
Mr Bonar is also seeking companies run by managers who can adapt to a
free-market economy. He has a chance to evaluate a company's management
during the period, usually six months to a year, that it takes to negotiate
a deal with the government. Only a handful of changes have been made in the
three companies UNP has bought. 'If I have to chop three or four members of
senior management, I've made a bad business decision,' Mr Bonar says.
In spite of the good track record, there is no shortage of risk. UNP's
latest prospectus lists 11 things that could go awry, from the unpredictable
timing of negotiations with the Polish government, to Polish accounting
standards and a volatile currency. It cautions that UNP's securities are
'speculative'.
But Mr Bonar is confident that Poland is undergoing a 'fundamental systemic
change' which will present enormous opportunities.
He predicts the Polish elections on September 19 will improve political
stability by eliminating most of the 29 parties vying for office.
As evidence that UNP is in the right place at the right time, Mr Bonar notes
that a leading US hot-water appliance maker has shown an interest in buying
all or part of the 90 per cent stake in BIAWAR which UNP acquired only nine
months ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO Carso, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, reported an 11.8 per
cent increase in profits to 668m new pesos (Dollars 214m) in the first half,
after improved performance at industrial subsidiaries, Nacobre, Cigatam,
Condumex, and Aluminio.
The company owns a controlling stake in Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly,
which last week reported a 12.9 per cent increase in second-quarter profits.
Telmex contributed a third of Carso's net profits.
Carso recorded a 42 per cent increase in sales to 4,701m pesos, but this was
due to consolidation of results at subsidiaries and an increased stake in
Frisco, the mining concern.
Underlying sales fell, as the company cut unprofitable lines at Condumex and
Nacobre, according to Baring Research in Mexico City.
The rationalisation boosted margins and helped push up operating profits to
819m pesos in the first half, a 71.3 increase.
Profits were given a strong lift by the improved performance of Cigatam, the
cigarette company, which according to Carso has gained market share at the
expense of its rival, La Moderna.
Frisco told the Mexican stock market that it had re-opened the silver mine
Real de Angeles, which had been closed earlier in the year due to low silver
prices. Real de Angeles produced 8.1m troy ounces of silver last year, 1.8
per cent of world output.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting target raised at
Union Carbide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday said it would step up its
cost-cutting measures by increasing its annual cost reduction target to
Dollars 575m, measured in 1990 dollars, from Dollars 400m.
Earlier this year, Carbide said it was a year ahead of schedule in its
efforts to reduce annual costs by Dollars 400m.
Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the company could save money by looking
closely at inventory control, production, distribution and maintenance.
Carbide is still feeling the pressure from tight margins in the polyethylene
and ethylene glycol markets.
For the second quarter, Carbide posted net income of Dollars 41m, or 24
cents a fully-diluted share, compared with Dollars 79m, or 48 cents, a year
earlier. Sales slipped to Dollars 1.24bn from Dollars 1.26bn.
Carbide's income from continuing operations was Dollars 41m in the quarter,
compared with Dollars 36m.
For the first half, the group had net income of Dollars 83m, compared with a
net deficit of Dollars 216m including one-time items. Income from continuing
operations rose to Dollars 83m, against Dollars 78m. Sales were flat at
Dollars 2.44bn.
Carbide said that its 1993 earnings would be reduced by about Dollars 80m to
Dollars 100m, reflecting additional severance costs related to the extended
cost-reduction programme and charges for the adoption of accounting
standards for post-employment benefits.

<TEXT>
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, yesterday unveiled a sharply
higher second-quarter loss.
However, the group said its financial restructuring was falling into place
and its operating performance had improved.
Net loss before restructuring costs was CDollars 44.3m (USDollars 34.7m),
against a loss of CDollars 33.8m a year earlier. However, including charges
totalling CDollars 85.7m, the final loss came out at CDollars 130.6m, or
CDollars 2.73, compared with a deficit of CDollars 34.4m, or 74 cents. The
year-earlier loss included CDollars 24.8m special gain.
For the first half, the group's final loss was CDollars 237.7m, or CDollars
4.97 a share, against one of CDollars 108.3m, or CDollars 2.30, a year
earlier.
Second-quarter operating revenues rose 3 per cent to CDollars 727m. In the
first half they rose 1 per cent to CDollars 1.4bn.
Domestic capacity was trimmed by 11.5 per cent, raising the domestic yield
by 9.6 per cent, while international traffic was higher. Total traffic was
up 1.3 per cent and the yield per passenger mile improved slightly.
Operating expenses were more closely controlled.
PWA said the latest CDollars 85.7m restructuring charge included a provision
for a CDollars 37.5m foreign exchange loss. All foreign debt is now being
translated at current exchange rates.
The balance covered debt rescheduling and moves to complete a CDollars 246m
equity injection by American Airlines in Canadian.
This deal is being held up by a court dispute over Canadian's joint interest
with rival Air Canada in the Gemini reservation system. Canadian must
dispose of this before the American Airlines deal can go through.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman, said more than 70 per cent of senior creditors had
signed the debt restructuring agreement and the rest should accept in the
next few weeks. 'We're working towards a satisfactory resolution of the
Gemini issue,' he said.
The centrepiece of the restructuring is conversion of CDollars 700m of debt
into equity. The whole plan is due to go before shareholders and debenture
holders by mid-September.
However, two companies have demanded immediate repayment of CDollars 109m of
subordinated debt. In all, PWA wants to restructure more than CDollars 3bn
of debt.

BETHLEHEM Steel expects to return to profitability in the third quarter of
1993, said Mr Curtis Barnette, the company's chairman, Reuter reports.
The US group reported a second-quarter loss of Dollars 5.3m, or 18 cents a

Mr Barnette maintained that the results of a cost-cutting programme,
achieving a satisfactory new labour agreement, better markets and achieving
fair trade in steel 'will return Bethlehem to profitability in the third
quarter of 1993.'
'We have continued to make steady and favourable progress in our return to
sustained profitability,' he said.
The company said its basic steel operations segment had income from
operations of Dollars 11m for the quarter, a Dollars 29m improvement from
the same period a year ago.
It cited increased volume and cost reduction efforts at its two main mills
as primary reasons for the improvement. Bethlehem said product mix was also
better.
Bethlehem said cash and cash equivalents totalled Dollars 205m at June 30,
against Dollars 208m at December 31 1992. It added that significant uses of
cash during the latest quarter included capital expenditures, pension
funding and repayment of short-term borrowings.
At June 30 this year, Dollars 294m was available for borrowing under a 1992
revolving credit agreement.

NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, yesterday moved further
from the brink of bankruptcy after its machinists' union voted to take part
in an employee pact which will save the airline Dollars 885m over three
years.
Earlier this month, Northwest ratified an agreement with its pilots' union.
The latest machinists' pact replaces an earlier tentative agreement which
was later rejected by the union.
The flight attendants' union is expected to accept the package when it votes
later this week.
As part of the terms of the deal, employees will have the option of taking a
37.5 per cent sake in the company in exchange for concessions.
NWA, the parent of Northwest, has also reached preliminary agreements with
its major bank and supplier creditors to reschedule most debt payments
through 1997, provided the carrier obtains the labour concessions.

EASTMAN KODAK, the photographic products company in the throes of
restructuring, yesterday reported a 3 per cent increase in second-quarter
net income and struck a cautiously optimistic note for the rest of the year.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said the second-quarter and first-half results
were a 'satisfactory beginning' consistent with the company's plan to
improve its performance this year.
'We continue to believe the company will generate moderately higher sales
this year, solid earnings from operations, and positive cash-flow.'
He also reported 'good progress on development of plans that will improve
our operating effectiveness, our cash flows and our ability to pay down
debt'. Kodak has already announced plans to spin off its Eastman Chemical
business.
Second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 371m, or Dollars 1.13 a share,
compared with Dollars 361m, or Dollars 1.11, in the same period last year.
The figures were held back by Dollars 12m of extraordinary charges for the
early retirement of debt and include Dollars 79m in earnings from Eastman
Chemical. Sales totalled Dollars 4.27bn, against Dollars 4.29bn.
Mr Whitmore described the results as 'better than expected', and the
company's shares rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 52 3/8 on Wall
Street.
Encouraging signs, he added, were an excellent operating margin of nearly 24
per cent in the imaging business and improvement in the rate of earnings in
the information operations, from a negative 3 per cent a year ago to a
positive 5 per cent in the most recent quarter.
For the six months, the company suffered a loss of Dollars 1.65bn, or
Dollars 5.05, after first-quarter charges of Dollars 2.17bn for accounting
changes. In the first half of last year it made Dollars 506m, or Dollars
1.56.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TANDEM Computers, the latest victim of computer industry turmoil, plans to
cut its workforce by about 15 per cent in a restructuring.
The company took a Dollars 451m third-quarter charge and reported an
operating loss. Between 1,600 and 1,800 jobs will be lost over the next 12
months.
The announcement follows Tandem's recent introduction of a new range of
smaller, more powerful, parallel computer systems and servers with
significantly lower prices than its previous products.
The cuts were necessary 'to bring the company's cost structure in line with
the new highly competitive pricing model,' Tandem maintained.
'There are two challenges in the computer industry: ongoing economic
weakness in international markets, and a fiercely competitive environment
created by low priced products and heavy discounting,' said Mr James
Treybig, president and chief executive.
'To become a low-price provider requires that we adopt a new business model
if we are going to achieve our profitability goals. This requires more than
just cutting costs; it requires re-engineering the business, changing our
culture, and continuously reducing our cost structure.'
Since the end of the third quarter, Tandem has reduced its workforce at
several locations, including its European subsidiaries. By the end of the
current quarter, 700 employees will have been laid off, the company said.
Tandem also cut the pay of remaining employees by 5 per cent and reduced
benefits. 'This is not a temporary measure, but a permanent shift in our
salary structure,' it said.
Tandem recorded third-quarter net losses of Dollars 549.5m, or Dollars 4.88
a share, after the restructuring charges. Operating losses for the quarter
were Dollars 44m. In the same period last year, it earned Dollars 17.4m, or
16 cents.
Revenues declined to Dollars 475.6m from Dollars 503.2m a year ago, due to
weak economic conditions, particularly in Europe, and customers' hesitation
to purchase current products in anticipation of the recent introduction of
low-cost computers, Tandem said.
'Fortunately, we have been implementing a product strategy that will take us
(through) the '90s. Last week we announced new products which, coupled with
our restructuring, will, we believe, lead to greatly improved earnings per
share in the next fiscal year,' said Mr Treybig.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Digital recovery slower than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment reported increased earnings for its fourth quarter as the
US computer manufacturer recovered from last year's heavy losses.
Digital's directors warned, however, that because of the uncertain economic
outlook 'we remain very cautious about our ability to maintain profitability
for the seasonally soft first quarter'.
In contrast to its rival, IBM, Digital's operating performance has improved,
but it has failed to meet Wall Street expectations. Analysts' projections
were set at around Dollars 1.06 per share.
Net earnings for the fourth quarter came out at Dollars 113.2m, or 85 cents
per share. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 1.86bn, or Dollars
14.76, last year when Digital took a Dollars 1.5bn restructuring charge.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 3.91bn, up slightly from last year's
Dollars 3.90bn.
For the year, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars 251.3m, or Dollars
1.93 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 2.8bn, or Dollars 22.39,
in fiscal 1992. Revenues advanced to Dollars 14.4bn from Dollars 13.9bn. The
1992 losses included a one-time charge of Dollars 485.5m for accounting
changes, plus the Dollars 1.5bn restructuring charge.
Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive, pointed to 'a continued,
significant improvement in our overall operating results both for the
quarter and the full year'.
'While I am not satisfied with any loss, my confidence in Digital's future
is fuelled by the improvements we have been able to achieve over the past
three quarters,' he said.
Since Mr Palmer joined Digital, last year, the company has posted a
cumulative net profit of Dollars 9m, he noted.
'With our new customer-focused business unit structure now in place, we are
poised to grow revenues and increase our market share, while continuing to
work diligently to reduce our costs,' he added.
Notwithstanding the seasonally soft September quarter, Mr Palmer was
confident that Digital was poised for resurgence.
Digital said it achieved some 'slight' revenue growth in the US with
stronger growth throughout Asia, during the fourth quarter. However, it
added that its European business was weak.

PETROBRAS, Brazil's state oil monopoly, yesterday raised net profits to
Dollars 269m for the first six months of 1993 as it benefited from
cost-cutting measures, AP-DJ reports from Rio de Janeiro.
The result was a sharp improvement from 1992, when profits totalled just
Dollars 26m in the first half and Dollars 56m for the year.
Gross earnings in the first six months were Dollars 8.3bn, and investments
totalled Dollars 1bn.
Mr Jose de Melo, assistant financial director, said the improved performance
was due to cuts in operational and financing costs.
He said that Petrobras had restructured its debt profile from short-term to
long-term.
An audit by the independent firm Ernst Young, Sotec in June had put the
company's debt at Dollars 4.7bn, including Dollars 3bn in short-term
obligations.
Mr Melo said Petrobras' debt in June totaled Dollars 4.5bn, up from Dollars
4.2bn at the same time last year.
The Brazilian government owes Petrobras Dollars 3.865bn.
Mr Paulino Cicero, mines and energy minister, said that retail fuel prices,
which are set by the government, were 42 per cent below what they should be.
Increases have been delayed to avoid stoking up inflation, currently running
at 30 per cent a month.
Petrobras produces daily about 653,000 barrels of oil and 19m cubic metres
of natural gas.
Earnings in 1992 were Dollars 14bn.

in Dollars 6bn deal

<TEXT>
MERCK, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday announced the
Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services, one of the US's
largest distributors of drugs.
The acquisition, the first vertical integration between a large manufacturer
and distributor in the US, will give Merck greater control over its sales,
just as pressure on healthcare costs has squeezed drugs companies' margins.
Medco, based in Montvale, New Jersey, is a fast-growing mail-order company.
It supplies the employees of many of the largest US corporations, including
General Motors and General Electric, with drugs under their company
healthcare plans. Mr Martin Wygod, chairman and founder, said 33m people
were covered by Medco schemes, and estimated that the company would account
for 12 per cent of drug sales in the US this year.
Mr Roy Vagelos, Merck chairman, said the acquisition marked a revolutionary
step for the group, and could change the drugs industry.
'The current system of pharmaceutical care is largely unco-ordinated and
unmanaged', resulting in over-prescription and waste, he said. The
integration of manufacturing and distribution would lead to more efficient
use of resources, and was consistent with the goals of the Clinton
administration to reduce US healthcare costs, he added.
US companies have turned to intermediaries, such as Medco, to help bring
down their healthcare costs. Medco, as a bulk buyer of drugs, can negotiate
large discounts. Medco reviews the drugs that doctors have prescribed to
patients covered by its schemes and, where suitable, recommends cheaper
products that achieve the same results.
In an attempt to protect Medco's extensive customer base, Merck said that
Medco would continue to provide drugs produced by other manufacturers. Medco
would retain its name and operational independence, while Mr Wygod would
join the Merck board.
Medco buys Dollars 250m of Merck drugs a year, just under 10 per cent of its
purchases. That proportion was likely to go up as Merck created products or
cut prices to suit Medco customers, the companies said.
Medco shareholders are being offered Dollars 39 in cash or 1.214 Merck
shares for each Medco share. Allocations will be adjusted so that, in total,
60 per cent of the transaction is paid for with Merck paper and the rest in
cash.
Merck said the acquisition would be financed by issuing equity and borrowing
through commercial paper and medium-term note markets.
Merck shares closed Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 30 3/4 , while Medco
jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 34 1/8.

sales
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, yesterday announced a near quadrupling of
second-quarter net earnings, driven by surging sales of new products in the
North American market.
The company, which two years ago was financially strained, underscored its
return to financial health with net earnings of Dollars 685m, or Dollars
1.86 a share, compared with Dollars 178m, or 54 cents, in the same period of
last year. Sales rose to Dollars 11.03bn from Dollars 9.31bn.
The latest quarter included post-tax gains of Dollars 71m from the sale of
stock in Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car company, and Dollars 39m from
the sale of its Acustar Plastics operation.
The company said that excluding these items its pre-tax profits totalled
Dollars 951m, its highest quarterly total.
Mr Robert Eaton, the chairman, said Chrysler had an extremely strong quarter
marked by 'tremendous market acceptance for our new products'. Retail sales
of mini-vans, trucks and Jeep vehicles remained strong and growing demand
for the company's new LH range of cars - the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision
and Chrysler Concorde - had added to profits and market share.
The company had continued to focus on better quality, waste elimination and
continuous improvement in all areas of the business.
Chrysler's combined North American retail car and truck market share was up
2.1 points over the same quarter of 1992.
The group's financial services subsidiary reported net earnings of Dollars
44m, down from Dollars 49m last year.
For the six months, Chrysler reported a net loss of Dollars 3.47bn, or
Dollars 10.38 a share, against earnings of Dollars 165m, or 46 cents, due to
a one-time non-cash charge of Dollars 4.68bn for a change in accounting for
retiree healthcare.

FORD Motor, the second-largest US car manufacturer, yesterday reported
doubled second-quarter earnings as stronger US vehicle sales and surging
financial services profits outweighed problems in the European market.
Ford reported earnings of Dollars 775m, or Dollars 1.43 a share, up from
Dollars 387m, or 70 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales and
revenues rose to Dollars 29.4bn from Dollars 26.8bn.
Mr Harold Poling, the chairman, said the improvement, in the midst of weak
economies and the company's aggressive product introduction programme,
showed 'we remain on course for better financial results in 1993 over last
year'.
However, he noted that in Europe most leading economies continued to worsen
during the quarter, and added: 'I'm not sure we have seen the bottom there
yet'.
Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 367m, up from Dollars 42m a
year ago, due to increased industry sales and increased market share. It
held 21.4 per cent of the US car market, up 0.5 of a point from a year ago,
while its light truck share was up 0.3 of a point at 30.2 per cent.
Outside the US, automotive operations earned Dollars 28m, down from Dollars
61m a year ago, due to weakness in Europe, where the company doubted it
would make profits this year.
The group's financial services company earned record profits of Dollars
380m, up from Dollars 284m a year ago, which was attributed mainly to
increased volume and reduced credit losses.
For the six months, Ford reported net income of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars
2.45, compared to a loss after accounting changes of Dollars 6.27bn, or
Dollars 13.13 in the same period of 1992. Sales rose to Dollars 56.18bn from
Dollars 51.4bn.

GROUPE Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer, suffered a fall in
sales and a rise in losses in the first half of 1992, the company said
yesterday.
The state-owned company reported net losses of FFr1.98bn (Dollars 341m) on
sales of FFr12.5bn for the first six months of 1993, compared with losses of
FFr1.69bn and sales of FFr13.8bn in the same period last year.
The company, which is negotiating a restructuring plan with the French
government, has accumulated losses of over FFr15bn in the past 3 1/2 years.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has said that the state cannot
continue to subsidise losses on this scale and has come under pressure from
the EC to reduce its financial support for the group.
Bull said that its first-half results reflected 'persistently unfavourable
economic conditions' and an 'acceleration of general price pressures in the
computer market'.
Zenith Data Systems, its personal computer division which is the single
biggest source of the group's losses, suffered a continued fall in profit
margins. The company said that this fall in margins more than offset a rise
in sales of PCs by ZDS.
Bull said it planned to return to profit in 1995. To achieve this it
announced measures to reduce costs and form alliances with other
international computer manufacturers. Earlier this month, the company
announced plans to reduce its workforce by 6,500 people, about 18 per cent
of the total, by the end of 1994. Last month, the company formed a PC design
and manufacturing alliance with Packard Bell.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: European operations slip further
into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD'S European operations fell deeper into the red in the second quarter,
and Mr Harold Poling, the chairman and chief executive, warned that there
could be a further deterioration.
The second-quarter net loss of Dollars 175m compared with a profit of
Dollars 23m in the same period of 1992.
Jaguar, Ford's UK-based luxury cars subsidiary, made a second-quarter loss
of Dollars 59.1m, although this represented a considerable improvement on a
year-ago loss of Dollars 72.5m.
Ford projected total European car and truck sales this year would fall 17
per cent to 12.4m. This has almost ruled out breaking even on European
operations this year.
Market conditions have continued to worsen since the first quarter, when the
European operations, including Jaguar, made a net loss of Dollars 82m
compared with a Dollars 84m profit in the previous year's quarter.
Since Jaguar's losses in the first quarter were Dollars 150.5m, down from
Dollars 242m in the same period in 1992, Ford's non-Jaguar European business
was marginally in profit in the opening stages of this year.
However, the European new car market has since slid further and Ford's share
of it has contracted. Its cars accounted for 11.3 per cent of all European
sales in the second quarter, compared with 11.5 per cent in the first.
The worsening of Ford's fortunes showed up sharply in second-quarter unit
sales in Germany, Europe's single biggest market, which dropped by 19.8 per
cent to 219,185.
UK sales fell more than 21 per cent to 117,405.
However, Ford said it had been hit by adverse currency shifts within Europe
and by higher product and marketing costs. It has also had to bear the
launch costs of the Mondeo medium car range, one of the most important
models in its history. Mr Poling said more than 250,000 orders for the
Mondeo had been received since its launch in March.

FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company staggering under
total borrowings of about L31,000bn (Dollars 19.6bn), may be facing
increasing difficulties in persuading banks to keep open lines of credit, in
spite of expressions of support by foreign bank creditors earlier this week.
A meeting yesterday of the five big Italian banks working on a rescue plan
for the group, which also lies at the heart of a growing storm concerning
alleged bribes to politicians over the Enimont chemicals venture, is
believed to have proposed bringing in a third foreign bank as a
'consultant'.
Citibank could join Societe Generale of France and UBS, which have already
been asked to act as advisers to the Italian five-bank committee and to the
Ferruzzi group, according to one banker present.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Polish seat plant to cost
Dollars 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is investing Dollars 50m in a green field operation in Poland to make
seat covers for export to its own car plants and other European vehicle
producers. The plant at Plonsk, some 60 miles north-west of Warsaw, is
planned to come on stream in 1994 and will employ up to 1,000 people.
The Plonsk facility is the third manufacturing venture by Ford in central
Europe since mid-1992.
Until last year, Ford had been among the more cautious of western vehicle
producers in establishing a production presence in the region.
However, it has identified Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia as
offering the best potential for Ford's strategy to establish a stronger
presence in the emerging economies of central and eastern Europe.
Earlier this month, it acquired Autopal, a Czech components manufacturer
specialising in automotive lighting and heat exchanger equipment including
air conditioning.
That acquisition provided Ford, for the first time, with an in-house
capability to produce lighting in Europe.
Initially, it is expected to produce 600,000 sets of covers a year for Ford
Escort and Orion models.
Starting in 1995, production is planned to rise to 1.1m a year with the
addition of supplies for the Ford Fiesta.
Ford is to build a Dollars 50m technical centre near Tokyo with the aim of
strengthening its ability to supply US-produced components to Japanese
vehicle makers.
The centre, due to become operational by mid-1995, will employ 80 people.

FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nomura bails out property
division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, the world's largest stockbroker, yesterday joined the
list of Japan's financial institutions forced into a costly corporate
restructuring by the collapse of property prices.
It is bailing out a troubled property lending affiliate - Nomura Finance -
by merging it with another offshoot. The move will allow the write-off of
Y200bn (Dollars 1.87bn) in bad loans, a cost which the group is to absorb.
The demise of Nomura Finance is a further indication of the problems
besetting non-bank financial institutions in Japan. It follows a number of
similar moves by commercial banks to ease the burden of their non-bank
subsidiaries, and could form a precedentfor other brokerage houseswhich are
similarly afflicted.
The bail-out is the second blow in a week for Nomura - last Thursday, Mr
Joseph Perella quit Wasserstein Perella, the Wall Street investment bank he
co-founded and into which Nomura sank Dollars 100m for a 20 per cent stake.
Nomura Finance, created in 1989 at the height of the property boom, had
operating assets of Y1,462bn as of March, but non-performing and other
doubtful loans put yesterday at Y330bn. It is being subsumed by Ivy Real
Estate, a subsidiary of Nomura Land and Building, a property management
unit.
Of the bad loans, Y200bn will be written off, financed by Ivy's unrealised
profits on landholdings, a capital increase by Ivy, and a Y100bn injection
from Nomura Securities over 10 years, for which it will receive
mortgage-backed paper.
Companies in the Nomura group together own 68.5 per cent of Nomura Finance,
although the stockbroker holds only 5 per cent. The stake is thus not
consolidated in Nomura Securities' group accounts, and the company insisted
yesterday's move would have no direct impact on profits.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Blood, sweat, tears and Spears - The
medicine being applied to aid recovery at Jones &amp; Shipman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS COMPANY never used to have a make-or-buy policy. It made,' says Mr
John Wareing, managing director of Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based
company which is one of the most famous surviving names in Britain's machine
tool industry.
'When I arrived in 1990 they made their own packing cases. They were the
best packing cases in the world but it wasn't cost-effective,' he recalls.
J&amp;S no longer makes packing cases, but it is not out of the woods yet.
This week, Mr Wareing will be meeting an unidentified trade investor,
believed to be a continental European machine tool company, which may take a
stake in the company as part of a possible new equity issue.
The talks could herald a new start for a company founded in 1899 but which
until recently was 'a dinosaur dying on its feet,' according to Mr Len
Weaver, chairman. They could also lead to the kind of cross-border
collaboration that the fragmented, financially weak European machine tool
industry badly needs.
Over the years, J&amp;S has suffered from the same problems that bedevilled
other UK machine tool companies now long departed - technological
conservatism, arrogance towards customers, and an inward-looking management
prone to infighting.
Its big problem in the current recession, though, was its manufacturing
strategy. 'If you've got a big machine shop and there's no work coming
through it becomes a massive overhead,' says Mr Wareing.
As sales dived from Pounds 30.9m in the year ended March 1990 to Pounds
15.9m in 1991-92, turning a Pounds 2.1m pre-tax profit into a Pounds 7.35m
loss, Mr Wareing tried everything to stem the flow of red ink. The workforce
was cut from 750 in 1990 to 520 by last July, short-time working was
introduced, but, he says, 'all the medicine was not going to work.'
Eventually, last July, Mr Wareing unveiled a strategy that would be the last
chance for survival. J&amp;S would sell its honing and small tools businesses to
concentrate on its core business of grinding machines, virtually ending
in-house machining of parts by switching to out-sourcing, and reduce its
manufacturing space.
A year later, the main machine shop at Leicester is unrecognisable. Empty
areas are roped off, the manufacturing space has been reduced by more than
half, and the overall workforce has been cut to 324 and will level off at
260 by October.
It has been a year, says Mr Wareing, of 'blood, sweat, tears and Spears' - a
reference to Mr Alan Spears, the new manufacturing director who joined the
company last August.
'We couldn't have done all this with someone who had been here 20 years and
had a sentimental attachment to anything,' says Mr Wareing.
Mr Spears and his team vetted 584 suppliers, visited 178 and signed up 12,
all from the UK, for long-term supply deals. This will rise to 25 soon as
ad-hoc outsourcing is converted into long-term arrangements.
The effect on the company's operating ratios has been equally dramatic.
Break-even levels have been halved in the past two years, says Mr Wareing,
and a third of the reduction has come in the past year. Meanwhile, Mr
Wareing has slashed the J&amp;S management from 39 before the recession to just
16.
There is a long way to go, but Mr Wareing is now much less worried about
J&amp;S' competitiveness against its continental rivals - companies like Elb and
Blohm of Germany and Switzerland's Magerle and Kellenberger, which all
subcontract as a matter of course.
Unfortunately, however, the restructuring has gone awry financially.
Originally, J&amp;S believed it could fund it internally, but this has not
happened for three reasons:
The small tools business was sold in February to a division of Suter for
Pounds 780,000, but Mr Wareing decided to keep the honing machine business,
realising the potential of selling grinding and honing machines as a
package;
One plot of vacated land next door to the main factory has been sold subject
to contract, but two others are unsold. 'I'm not going to sell the family
silver at silly prices,' says Mr Wareing;
The recession has continued to depress order books.
Mr Wareing does not want to borrow any more, preferring to keep gearing at
its current level of 40 per cent. Instead, he says: 'We now need to convert
some debt into equity by going to the City for some money.'
How much, and in precisely what form, is not clear but Mr Wareing is hoping
institutions will line up behind the trade investor to provide the cash.
The deal, he concedes, is very important for J&amp;S. 'It will give us the
headroom to complete the reorganisation, continue with our product
development programme and take the business forward.'
In spite of its past mistakes, J&amp;S deserves to survive and prosper. Its
shares may have plummeted from a 1990 high of 177p to 22p yesterday, valuing
it at Pounds 2.68m, but it is one of the biggest and most innovative UK
machine tool builders and employers.
Over the past two years J&amp;S has emerged as a world leader in 'creep feed'
grinding technology which it acquired from the US Brown &amp; Sharpe company in
1991 and has since developed further.
Creep feed grinding removes large amounts of metal from a part in one go,
giving increased productivity compared with conventional machining. It is
used extensively in the aerospace industry but J&amp;S is already selling it in
non-aerospace markets where the technology has hardly scraped the surface.
On top of this, J&amp;S has notched up important successes recently in the Far
East, and has re-established its name in the US market by substituting its
own sales operation for a joint venture with Brown &amp; Sharpe.
Mr Wareing sees signs of increasing confidence in the UK market, and says
devaluation in Europe has given J&amp;S a tremendous advantage in Europe to add
to its internal productivity improvements. The only problem is that
continental markets are going the opposite way to the UK at present.
The identity of the trade investor is likely to be revealed in September,
and 1992-93 results have been delayed because of the talks.
Some observers believe the best solution would be a German partner. J&amp;S
acknowledges it is very weak in the German market, which in spite of its
current doldrums is still the most important market in Europe.
Two things seem certain about the planned equity issue. In the current
climate in the European machine tool industry, the deal will be mutually
beneficial. And shareholders, which include Postel, Invesco and Prudential,
will suffer some dilution depending on the terms.
However, Mr Wareing is the sort of no-nonsense executive that the City likes
to see running engineering companies, and seems to have investors on his
side.
'He's delivered on virtually everything he promised, which is not an easy
job in a company with so many traditions,' says one institution.
'The proposals don't cause us a problem, and our main point of concern is
that the company survives and goes forward.'

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca faces struggle to beat hostile
environment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, ICI's recently floated bioscience business, could not have been born
at a more inauspicious time. Its pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and
specialities businesses are all struggling in an extremely hostile
environment.
Healthcare reform in Germany and Italy have stunned the European drugs
market, which is now static compared with an 8 per cent increase last year.
Reforms in France and the UK, as well as additional measures in Germany, are
expected over the next 12 months.
In the US, reforms are also being prepared by the Clinton administration,
although the expanding power of bulk buyers of healthcare will probably have
more impact than any reforms.
Meanwhile, Zeneca's pharmaceuticals division is struggling with the US
patent expiry of its best-selling drug, the heart treatment Tenormin. Once
the world's fifth top-selling drug, with sales of Pounds 652m, its US sales
have halved in less than 12 months.
As for the agrochemical sector, in which Zeneca is the second largest after
Ciba of Switzerland, it is struggling with higher development costs - a
direct result of greater regulation - and a stagnant market.
The reforms of the Common Agriculture Policy have knocked the European
market, the world's largest, backwards.
Speciality operations are also suffering from the general recession. Mr John
Mayo, Zeneca's finance director and architect of its split from ICI, admits
the division's results are unacceptable.
Zeneca's most important operation is the pharmaceuticals division, with
sales last year of Pounds 1.6bn. The best way of dealing with the new
price-conscious drugs environment would be to compensate with innovative
compounds that can drive growth through volume.
Zeneca has four products with fast expanding sales. Three: Zoladex, Nolvadex
and Diprivan, are hospital products and protected from the worst of the
healthcare reforms in Germany and the US. The fourth is Zestril, a heart
drug, which must struggle against a large number of competitive products in
the same class. The group will have its work cut out to differentiate the
product, particularly in the US.
These four products will start to stagnate in about 1996 or 1997, according
to Kleinwort Benson analysts. After that, growth will depend upon new
products such as the antibiotic Merrem, and Casodex, a treatment for
prostatic cancer. Beyond that is Accolate, an asthma treatment, and
Seroquel, a therapy for schizophrenia.
Zeneca has thoroughly reorganised its research and development activities in
recent years. Its management maintains that all being equal its drugs should
not fail during the development process, like some of its earlier compounds
such as Statil and Corwin.
In the meantime, Zeneca's management must show its teeth in adapting to the
new environment. Other pharmaceuticals groups have been busy adjusting their
cost-bases to adapt to the new circumstances in Italy, Germany and the US.
Zeneca has laid off about 100 pharmaceuticals sales representatives in the
US.
Additional cuts may be necessary in the pharmaceuticals division, and will
certainly be obligatory in the specialities businesses, which last year
generated operating profits of only Pounds 26m on sales of Pounds 936m.
Zeneca's agrochemicals business generated sales last year of Pounds 1.2bn.
Its future is secure, but profitability is a problem and competition is
becoming tougher.
A series of mergers and acquisitions are creating significant opposition.
Shell's business has been acquired by American Cyanamid; Rhone-Poulenc of
France has linked up with Sumitomo of Japan; and Schering, the Berlin-based
group, is forming a joint-venture with Hoechst of Germany, which in turn is
taking on the agrochemicals business of its majority-owned subsidiary
Roussel-Uclaf of France.
In the immediate future, Zeneca's agrochemicals business may surprise,
following useful agrochemicals results reported last week by Monsanto of the
US. But in the longer term, the operations will find the going ever-tougher.
Zeneca's management insists the company is sufficiently large to cope with
the new harsh environment. That may be so. But Zeneca will have to be
nimble. Freed from the deadening hand of ICI's Millbank headquarters'
bureaucracy, the company must now show it can adapt quickly enough to
survive.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Relaunch into more enterprising culture -
Paul Abrahams sets the scene for today's ICI result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, flagship of British manufacturing industry,
will today announce its first results without Zeneca, its recently floated
bioscience operations.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's new chief executive, will have the opportunity to
describe how he intends to navigate the world's sixth largest chemical group
through the malaise that has overwhelmed the sector.
The demerger's aim is to allow ICI executives to concentrate on a narrower
range of businesses, and to release what Mr Hampel calls 'creative
management energies.'
ICI is being relaunched with a very different and much more enterprising and
profit-conscious culture, he argues.
ICI could have done with some creative management in the past. As Mr Hampel
admits: 'Our focus on profitability was less good than it should have been.
ICI did not drive its businesses, good or bad, hard enough.'
Management will need to be especially creative; the trading environment is
grim and Mr Hampel's targets are challenging. Each business will be required
to achieve a rate of return on assets employed of at least 20 per cent on
average over the next five years.
His ability to achieve such targets will depend partly on management and
partly on the economic cycle.
The company is two thirds of the way through a three-year restructuring
programme aimed at saving Pounds 400m a year.
About 17,000 jobs have disappeared. A further 7,000 will go over the next
three years, and another 8,000 through disposals of non-core and
under-performing businesses, according to Mr Hampel.
However, such measures may only allow ICI to stand still, given the poor
business environment. Most of the group's activities are heavily cyclical,
capital-intensive operations whose profitability is volume-related.
Prices for ICI's products will have to improve before it can start
increasing profits significantly. Mr David Ingles, chemical analyst at
brokers James Capel, explains: 'Prices depend upon the demand and supply
balance and this is almost impossible to predict in terms of either its
extent or timing.'
On the plus side, about a quarter of ICI's turnover is in the US, where a
patchy recovery is happening. A further 20 per cent is generated in the
fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, although some of that is in Australasia.
The UK market, which accounts for about 25 per cent of sales, is also
recovering, but slowly.
On the minus side, continental Europe, which generates 25 per cent of
turnover, is decelerating rapidly, to the extent that it could undermine the
UK recovery.
Some divisions are less affected by the economic malaise.
Both paints and explosives are stable businesses. Paints generated sales of
Pounds 1.5bn last year and operating profits of Pounds 115m. Kleinwort
Benson is predicting profits of Pounds 107m for the full year.
Operating profits from explosives last year were Pounds 59m on turnover of
Pounds 549m and Pounds 50m is forecast on sales of Pounds 600m this year.
Results at the materials division are likely to be be dire. With sales of
Pounds 1.8bn last year - 22 per cent of group turnover - the division
incurred a Pounds 25m loss and is expected to make only Pounds 10m for the
full-year.
More difficult to predict is the performance of ICI's industrial chemical
division, which still dominates the company. It made sales last year of
Pounds 3.5bn, 42 per cent of group turnover, and lost Pounds 17m in the
process.
The medium-term outlook for industrial chemicals remains grim. Prices of PVC
 -of which ICI's partly owned subsidiary EVC is Europe's largest
manufacturer - have fallen from a peak of DM1.85 in 1989 to DM1 during the
second quarter of this year.
In the longer term, investors are betting that the division's profitability
will recover to the peak levels of 1989, when as industrial products it
reported trading profits of Pounds 789m on sales of Pounds 5.7bn.
But even if demand picks up, it is doubtful that profits will reach such
levels.
Mr Ingles reckons that there will be no repeat of the rapid recovery seen in
the 1980s and the massive imbalance between supply and demand is likely to
dominate the sector for many years. One leading manufacturer of titanium
dioxide - ICI is the world's second largest producer - thinks that it could
be 1997 before demand catches up with supply.
Mr Hampel recognises that most ICI businesses are cyclical and there is
little he can do to change cyclical fluctuations in demand. He says the
company has a simple overall objective - to enhance shareholder value by
developing businesses selectively and profitably.
'Gone are the days when ICI could afford to carry businesses in which we can
have no competitive advantage and which do not have profitable potential,'
says Mr Hampel.
The less profitable are likely to be selected out of the company. Some
businesses will be disposed of or swapped, though not necessarily in the
near future. The company has low debts and is not a distressed seller.
The ICI that leaves the 1990s will be very different from the one that
entered the decade. Mr Hampel now has to prove that it can be more
profitable.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker questioned on compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR KEITH Bright, chairman of Brent Walker, told shareholders at yesterday's
annual meeting that the group was 'considering a number of possibilities
with regard to the financing of William Hill', the group's betting shop
chain.
He said 'when these become firm we shall give you further details.'
Although questions from shareholders lasted for an hour, the meeting only
occasionally became heated. One shareholder asked if the board were 'all
dummies' when the directors were unable to answer a question about
compensation to former directors.
William Hill's syndicate of banks, owed Pounds 350m, are due to be repaid on
March 1 next year. Options open to the group include a full or partial sale,
flotation or refinancing of the debt.
A consortium of investors, led by SG Warburg, has approached Brent Walker
with a Pounds 360m leveraged offer.
Asked about that offer Sir Keith said 'there are one or two people around
who would like to make a turn for themselves.'
Any sale of William Hill would be subject to shareholder approval. He said
William Hill's turnover was 'substantially' higher following the start of
evening opening, but that it had had a run of bad luck lately.
Since joining the group in January he had been reviewing all its activities.
He aimed to improve profitability to provide a firm base for a 'sensible
financial and capital structure to be evolved'. The review would be
completed shortly, he said, and would go to the board and the group's banks.
He said shareholders would be given details of those matters as they were
resolved.
Asked about the Pounds 240,000 payment in compensation to former directors,
Mr John Leach, finance director, confirmed that this was a payment to Lord
Kindersley, the group's former chairman who resigned in July last year.
Lord Kindersley had had a five-year, fixed-term contract and was entitled to
the salary for the remaining portion of the contract, Mr Leach said. The
contract was signed when Mr George Walker was still chief executive of the
group.
Sir Keith has a fixed three-year contract, running to January 1996. He was
initially appointed on a salary of Pounds 15,000 a month for a two-to-three
day week. That was increased to Pounds 20,000 a month for a three-to-four
day week. He also receives Pounds 30,000 a year in pension contributions.
The company pays 75 per cent of his salary to a company of Sir Keith's with
the rest directly to him. He has an incentive plan linked to the successful
repayment of the banks' debt.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place buys fund manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST JAMES'S Place Capital, the investment company run by Sir Mark Weinberg
and Lord Rothschild, is to acquire International Financial Markets Trading,
the specialist fund management company, as part of its drive to become a
focused financial services company.
The move follows SJPC's unbundling of its stake in RIT Capital Partners
earlier this week through a Pounds 137m cash and paper pay-out to
shareholders, which reduced the size of the business by about a third.
SJPC has agreed with IFM's parent company, Bermuda-based Walsingham, to
purchase all outstanding shares in IFM for Dollars 9m (Pounds 6m),
comprising up of Dollars 2m in book value and Dollars 7m for goodwill. The
existing management will also receive a share of this year's profits, which
is likely to total some Dollars 3m in cash based on current expectations.
Net profits before tax of IFM's continuing businesses were some Dollars 2.5m
for the year ended December 31 1992.
The acquisition is subject to approval by Walsingham shareholders at a
meeting on August 26.
IFM, set up in 1984 to trade its own capital, began to manage third-party
funds in 1988 and currently has Dollars 455m under management, invested by
institutions and high net worth individuals.
The company specialises in the growing area of hedge funds, which apply
quantitative techniques, often using derivative instruments, to investment
management.
Mr Clive Gibson, a director of SJPC, said that future acquisitions could
include other fund management businesses, possibly using more conventional
fund management techniques, or niche banking or stockbroking businesses.
He described the company's approach as 'opportunistic', adding that any
acquisitions would be 'high-margin, focused financial services businesses.'
SJPC's existing interests include insurance, through J Rothschild Assurance
and fund management, through J Rothschild Investment Management, J
Rothschild Capital management and Global Asset Management.
On completion of the acquisition, Sir Mark Weinberg will become chairman of
IFM and Mr Gibson will join the board.
One of IFM's existing institutional investors, American International Group,
the US insurance company, is engaged in discussions to acquire a minority
interest in IFM from SJPC.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: National Power says output to fall by 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, said yesterday it expected output
to fall by 13 per cent to 95 terrawatt hours this year as competition for
its coal-fired plants from nuclear power and gas-fired stations increased.
The forecast reduction follows a 7 per cent fall to 109 terrawatt hours last
year.
Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, told the company's annual meeting that it
would be difficult to match profit growth of recent years. However, the
current level of dividend cover provided scope for continuing increases in
dividends.
Mr Brian Birkenhead, finance director, said the company intended to reduce
dividend cover to about two and a half times, depending on market
circumstances. Last year dividends were covered 3.1 times by earnings.
The City took news of prospective falls in market share calmly.
SG Warburg expects earnings per share growth this year to be about 10 per
cent, against 15 per cent last year.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Excalibur incurs Pounds 6m deficit and
makes boardroom changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses of Pounds 6.2m for the year to April 30, a halved dividend
and a new position of group chief executive were announced yesterday by
Excalibur, the precision engineering and jewellery group.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 20,000 last time, restated from
Pounds 1.11m after applying FRS 3.
However, Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said decisive action had been taken
to eliminate loss-making businesses, and there were plans to sell some
assets to strengthen the balance sheet, which was just over 100 per cent
geared at the year end.
The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 13p. Earlier this year they had jumped on bid
speculation to 20 3/4 p, but fell back when talks with a possible buyer
ended in May.
Mr Richard Griffiths, the chairman's brother, is stepping down as managing
director to be a non-executive, and Mr Arthur Church, is joining as group
chief executive.
Group sales fell from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 61.6m. Profits from precision
engineering came to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 2.25m) after losses of about Pounds
500,000 at Hi-Ton. Giftware profits fell from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 1.32m
while jewellery losses rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.14m). There were
restructuring costs of Pounds 602,000 in precision engineering - where
Hi-Ton will be merged with Burman on one site.
Provisions of Pounds 5.78m against the jewellery division and interest of
Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.82m) contributed to the pre-tax loss. Losses were
10.5p (0.1p). The final dividend is halved to 0.3p to give a total of 0.5p
(1p).

<TEXT>
COURTAULDS, the internat-ional chemical materials company, has formed a
50-50 joint venture with Allied Colloids, the speciality chemicals company,
to produce Oasis, a new super-absorbent fibre.
A Pounds 8.4m plant will be built on the Courtaulds Fibres site at Grimsby.
The new company will employ about 25 people and production is expected to
start in late 1994.
Initial annual capacity is targeted at 1,000 tons. As demand grows, capacity
can be doubled at an estimated addition of Pounds 2m, according to Mr Peter
Flesher, managing director of Allied Colloids.
Chemically similar to the polyacrylate powders currently used for their
super-absorbent properties, Oasis is designed for use in disposable personal
hygiene products, wrappings for optical and power cables and speciality
non-woven products ranging from construction to horticultural and medical
applications.
The move was seen as in line with the growing trend to diversify risks and
spread the costs of research and development in the industry.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Prestwick shares dive on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESTWICK Holdings, the printed circuit board manufacturer, warned yesterday
that it would incur a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3.7m for the year to July
31 and would be forced to pass the dividend on its cumulative convertible
redeemable preference shares.
The company's ordinary shares fell sharply after the warning and closed 12p
lower at 29p while the preference shares lost 35p to close at 58p.
The warning follows the resignation early last month of Mr Wayne Osman, the
group's former chief executive who had run Prestwick since 1990. Mr John
Gilhooly, a senior figure in the electronics industry and deputy chairman of
Albacom, became acting chief executive and deputy chairman.
Mr Gilhooly instigated a 'major strategic review' of the business against
the background of erratic customer demand, price pressures and increased raw
material costs which have continued to affect trading.
The review highlighted the problems Prestwick has had with a number of small
acquisitions it had made over the past 2 1/2 years. 'We have suffered very
badly from not digesting the small acquisitions we have made,' said Mr
Alastair McKie, executive director, yesterday. 'Not only did they not
contribute, they incurred losses.'
A projected Pounds 3m operating loss for the current year comes after Pounds
2.1m in provisions for non-recurring items including obsolete fixed assets.
Mr McKie said all of the operating losses are attributable to these 'smaller
business units'. In addition interest costs are expected to total about
Pounds 700,000.
Because the loss will eliminate distributable reserves the company will be
unable to declare a further dividend in respect of its 7.25 per cent
preference shares. However, the group intends to restore dividend payments
'at the earliest possible date,' probably following a capital
reorganisation.
The company said that as a result of the strategic review 'vigorous
management action' is being taken to reduce costs, implement profit
improvement programmes and strenghthen financial controls.
As part of this process Mr McKie said the group was being organised into
three operating companies, one comprising the smaller business units and the
other two based on the group's Ayr and Irving plants.
The group emphasised that the trading prospects of the core business remain
sound and that it continued to enjoy the support of its principal bankers.
The preliminary results are expected to be released at the end of September.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BAT to cut price of US cigarettes next
month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT INDUSTRIES will begin discounting a number of its US cigarette brands
next month in response to Philip Morris's reduction in the wholesale price
of Marlboro.
Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, said yesterday that the
wholesale price of Kool and Capri, its main premium brands, would be reduced
by 40 cents a pack to match the Marlboro discount.
At the same time, the list prices of its lower-priced brands, notably GPC,
would be raised.
'It is too early to say what will happen in the retail market,' he said. But
tactical action would be taken where necessary to protect market share.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said: 'The most recent developments indicate
that the price of full revenue brands will be permanently reduced, making
the industry as a whole less profitable but still strongly cash generative.'
It was not the end of the road for premium brands, he added. 'The top end of
the market is still highly profitable.' However, improving margins on
discount brands would not fully compensate Brown &amp; Williamson, BAT's US
subsidiary, for the profit reduction.
Though the US price war would have a continuing impact into 1994 and beyond,
Mr Broughton said it was unlikely to spread to other international markets.
'The US market is different from the rest with higher margins and different
pricing categories.' The effect on BAT's results in the first half of the
year was largely confined to a Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) drop in Brown &amp;
Williamson's trading profits, as a result of reductions in the stocks of
Kool held in the trade.
Overall operating profits from tobacco operations increased from Pounds 518m
to Pounds 623m on turnover ahead from Pounds 5.51bn to Pounds 5.63bn.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life rises 7% - Advance to
Pounds 152.5m despite slight reduction in new business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life insurance group, yesterday announced a 7 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 152.5m for the six months ended June
30, despite slightly lower new business activity in its two key
subsidiaries.
Earnings per share came to 14.3p (13.9p), while the interim dividend was
again 6.3p.
Profits in the Lloyds Abbey Life insurance division rose slightly to Pounds
69m, although new life and pensions business, on an annualised basis, fell
by nearly 2 per cent to Pounds 106m.
The modest decline in sales coincides with a drop in sales agents at Lloyds
Abbey Life. This follows new regulatory requirements on the training and
competency of staff. From 3,500 sales agents at its peak, the number could
fall to 2,500 by the end of this year.
Sales of unit trusts however, more than trebled to Pounds 371.5m.
Profits within the Black Horse Financial Services division, based in
branches of Lloyds Bank, the company's 60 per cent shareholder, rose by 18
per cent to Pounds 60m, despite lower life and pensions sales. Much of the
rise reflects the recognition in the current period of profits earned on
older business under the embedded value method of calculating life insurance
company profits.
Also within the past few weeks, the company has temporarily suspended its
pensions transfers business at its Black Horse division while the Securities
and Investments Board, the regulatory body which oversees its activities,
completes a review of pensions policies sold through banks.
Pensions transfers, which represent less than 15 per cent of pensions
policies sold at Black Horse, are policies sold to those transferring out of
occupational schemes and regulators have become concerned that they are
being sold to people who would be better off remaining where they are.
Almost all banks which sell personal pensions have at least temporarily
suspended their pensions transfers business.
Meanwhile, sales of unit trusts at Black Horse, more than trebled to Pounds
332m. Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, said unit trust sales reflected
'people who were dissatisfied with the rates they were earning on deposit
accounts.' Nearly half of the unit trust sales at Black Horse are from
Lloyds Bank customers who have switched their own accounts into unit trusts.
However, he said that unit trust sales had experienced a 'bulge' in the
middle of the period and have slowed down slightly recently although they
were still 'quite strong'.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: French aid helps D Smith to Pounds 27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office supplies group,
reported sharply higher full-year profits and said trading volumes were
improving in the UK, but deteriorating on the Continent.
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said although UK prices remained
depressed, volumes in packaging 'are moving ahead by about 3 to 4 per cent.'
Pre-tax profits increased by 76 per cent to Pounds 27.1m in the year to May
1, fuelled by a full-year contribution from Kaysersberg Packaging of France
which was acquired at the start of April 1992.
That compared with Pounds 15.4m in the previous year when profits were
depressed by Pounds 8.7m of costs for redundancies and other reorganisation
expenses.
Earnings increased to 22p (11.5p). The final dividend of 7.25p makes a total
for the year of 10p (9.5p).
The latest results were unchanged from the estimates made last month when
the group announced the Pounds 95m acquisition of Spicers, the UK's largest
wholesaler of office products, from Svenska Cellulosa of Sweden.
Turnover rose to Pounds 518.9m (Pounds 361.5m) and operating profit jumped
to Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 13.3m) including Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 1.8m) from
Kaysersberg.
Interest charges of Pounds 11m, against net income of Pounds 2.1m, reflected
increased borrowings following the Kaysersberg acquisition and the capital
investment programme.
COMMENT
David S Smith's recent performance has been fuelled by the acquisition of
Kaysersberg which has helped disguise the severe impact of the recession on
the UK paper and packaging businesses. Spicers will add an important third
leg to the business while the tentative first signs of the long-awaited
turning of the cycle should eventually bring relief to St Regis Paper which
nevertheless remained in profit last year because the results of specialist
mills offset those from the commodity corrugated case materials mills. First
half performance will be held back by the completion of the Kemsley
development programme, but full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 44m and
earnings per share of 26.3p are expected producing a prospective p/e of
14.4.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eagle Star Pounds 12m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGACY of its expansion in the late 1980s yesterday came back to haunt
Eagle Star, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, which reported
unexpected losses of Pounds 57m on its discontinued mortgage indemnity
business in the first six months of 1993.
The deficit offset a profit of Pounds 45m on other lines leaving the group
with Pounds 12m pre-tax losses.
Pre-tax profits at Allied Dunbar grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 74m. Farmers'
produced a 6 per cent increase in its trading result to Pounds 216m, lifting
overall profits from financial services to Pounds 303m (Pounds 208m).
The new mortgage indemnity losses have arisen on agency pool business, in
which Eagle Star insured loans made by the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce and some centralised lenders.
The policies provided additional insurance cover to lenders for any losses
suffered on the sale of repossessed properties, and are usually additional
to domestic mortgage indemnity policies. While domestic mortgage indemnity
usually cover losses equal to up to 30 per cent of the value of a mortgage,
the agency pool policies typically cover any remaining exposures.
The group withdrew from these lines of business in 1990 but Mr Martin
Broughton, chief executive, is expecting further losses in the second half
of 1993.
'It is very difficult to read but my best guess would be a further Pounds
50m in losses,' said Mr Broughton, adding that Eagle Star had also been
surprised by a 25 per cent increase in the average cost of agency pool
claims to Pounds 26,000 in the first half.
Total losses from agency pool business amount to Pounds 200m, contributing
to an overall deficit to date from commercial and domestic mortgage
indemnity insurance of more than Pounds 900m.
Excluding agency pool losses, underwriting deficit fell to Pounds 97m
(Pounds 172m).

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant loss at Pounds 15.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODE DURRANT, the industrial holding company, yesterday announced a
deepening of pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.48m to Pounds 15.4m over the 12
months to April 30 1993, as accounting treatments obliterated small
operating profits for the second successive year.
However, the shares rose 7p to 93p after the recommended final dividend was
maintained of 3.25p, giving an unchanged total of 5.4p.
Losses per share were 31.2p (6.3p).
Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said: 'For the first time for a number
of years we can now look forward with confidence.'
He said the company remained cautious about the outlook for the economy in
general.
Turnover fell to Pounds 173.5m (Pounds 178.2m) including Pounds 101.8m
(Pounds 103.5m) from Laidlaw Leasing, which the company sold to Quick's
Group after the year-end for Pounds 8.2m cash.
The company incurred an Pounds 18.4m loss on the Pounds 26m acquisition,
made in 1987, as a result of a goodwill write-back.
The comapny had already provided for this and it did not affect
shareholders' funds.
Under new accounting rules, this and other one-off charges made a total of
Pounds 19.8m in exceptional items which wiped out pre-exceptional profits of
Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 5.09m).
The Northgate vehicle hire division made the largest contribution of Pounds
3.53m (Pounds 2.52m) to pre-exceptional profits and pre-tax profits, with
associated undertakings contributing Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.08m).
The remaining element of Laidlaw, a leasing business, made reduced profits
of Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 341,000), contributing to pre-exceptional profits
with equipment hire declining into losses of Pounds 172,000, compared with
profits of Pounds 300,000 in the previous period.
Housebuilding and construction also contributed a pre-exceptional loss of
Pounds 168,000 against profits of Pounds 362,000 last time.
Goode Durrant had net borrowings of Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 34.8m), with the
Laidlaw disposal helping to reduce debt by about Pounds 15.6m.
Gearing, including vehicle finance, fell from 71 to 39 per cent.

FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Northern Foods in milk deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN FOODS is adding to its liquid milk business through the Pounds 7.2m
purchase of MD Foods' activities in the south-west of England
Northern said the deal would strengthen its position as a substantial milk
buyer when the Milk Marketing Board is abolished next year.
The acquisition is conditional on not being referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission and is unlikely to be completed before October.
MD Foods, the UK subsidiary of Denmark's largest dairy group, bought the
business as part of its purchase of Co-operative Retail Services' dairy
division in July 1992. It decided the Bristol dairy, which handles 42m
litres a year, and has annual sales of Pounds 19m, was too small to justify
the capital expenditure needed to bring it up to the standards of its other
dairies.
Northern is buying seven depots but will not take over the Bristol dairy,
which MD will close with the loss of 125 jobs.
Northern Foods will upgrade its own dairy at Thornbury, north of Bristol.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Ford and Chrysler rise strongly on upturn in US car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the 'Big Three' US car manufacturers - Ford Motor and Chrysler -
yesterday reported strong increases in second quarter profits.
This was powered by a gradual recovery in the US economy and by gains in
market share at the expense of Japanese rivals.
Ford announced that earnings had doubled to Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m), or
Dollars 1.43 a share, from Dollars 387m, or 70 cents a share, in the same
period of last year.
Chrysler's income nearly quadrupled from Dollars 178m, or 54 cents a share,
to Dollars 685m, or Dollars 1.86 a share. Ford's figures were in line with
market expectations and its shares rose Dollars  3/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange to close at Dollars 52.
Chrysler's results disappointed the market and its shares dipped Dollars 2
1/8 to close at 42 5/8 .
General Motors, the largest US vehicle company which is going through a
severe restructuring, will report its results today. Analysts are expecting
it to announce earnings of around Dollars 800m, compared with a loss of
Dollars 703m a year ago.
The three companies have been helped by a gradual improvement in US vehicle
sales, though both GM and Ford, which have big operations in Europe, have
suffered from the sharp slowdown in continental economies, particularly
Germany.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, said yesterday: 'I'm not sure we have
seen the bottom there (in Europe) yet.'
In the US market, the three companies have also benefited from an
enhancement of their product mix.
Higher-value vehicles have accounted for a larger proportion of sales.

FT  29 JUL 93 / When surgery will not prove the whole cure: IBM's radical
cuts and ask - what then?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The axeman cometh. Mr Lou Gerstner, the tough, impatient new chairman of
IBM, this week gave the world its first peep at his plans to restore the
floundering computer giant to health - severe cuts in IBM's size top his
action list.
Less than four months after he took over as chairman, Mr Gerstner announced
on Tuesday that IBM was taking an Dollars 8.9bn (Pounds 6bn) charge - one of
the largest restructuring provisions in US corporate history - to cover
60,000 job cuts and the closure of factories and offices around the world
over the next 18 months.
His rapid action is hardly surprising. In spite of seven years of endless
cost-cutting, IBM is still too fat and cumbersome for its much diminished
role in the computer world. Mr Gerstner comes to the company with a powerful
reputation as a cost-cutter, gained in his previous job as chairman of the
food and tobacco group RJR Nabisco.
As a newcomer to IBM, lacking personal loyalties or deep immersion in its
conservative corporate culture, he can slash away at dead wood rather than
engage in the annual, more limited pruning carried out by his predecessor,
Mr John Akers, whose failure to solve IBM's problems eventually forced him
out.
But while cuts had been expected, the sheer scale of Mr Gerstner's action
has pleasantly surprised Wall Street, which is hailing it as a refreshing
sign of greater realism at the often arrogant company. Mr Gerstner says that
while the cuts are large, he hopes they will be the last.
Yet for all the blood and thunder, this week's action leaves open a much
more important question: can Mr Gerstner create a strategy for IBM which
will restore it to a leading position in the industry, or this just another
painful milestone in the comp-any's long decline? In short, is Mr Gerstner
as good with the fertiliser as he is with the axe?
'Gerstner may be fabulous at cost cutting, and still see IBM collapse over
the next five years or so,' says Mr Charles Ferguson, an industry consultant
and co-author of Computer Wars, a book on IBM and its troubles. 'The tough
part will be deciding what strategies he will pursue to carve out a
profitable niche.'
On this score, his pronouncements this week have sown a degree of disquiet
among some industry analysts. Asked repeatedly by journalists to give an
insight into his strategic thinking, Mr Gerstner replied that he still had
to figure out where IBM would concentrate its resources; that he did not
want his competitors to know his plans; and that his first priority was to
fix the company's 'business economics'.
'The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision,' he said. 'What IBM needs
right now is a series of very tough-minded, market driven, highly effective
strategies that deliver performance in the marketplace and shareholder
value.' His approach reflects IBM's financial distress. The company
announced its third consecutive quarter of operating losses on Tuesday -
Dollars 40m of red ink in the three months to June on revenues of Dollars
15.5bn.
Mr Gerstner's cuts should save the company Dollars 4bn a year when fully
implemented in 1994 and restore it to profitability.
Perhaps it is too much to expect anyone to come up in a mere 16 weeks with
solutions to the immensely complex strategy problems of IBM, which stem from
technology decisions taken a decade or more ago.
IBM, which has long dominated the global market for large mainframe
computers, was slow in the early 1980s to recognise the implications of the
invention of powerful new micro-processor chips. These drastically cut the
cost of computing power and encouraged companies to replace big, central
processing units with networks of smaller desktop machines.
Sales of its flagship mainframe computers are declining rapidly, and while
Mr Gerstner rejects the notion that the 'mainframe is dead', he acknowledges
that profit margins are being eroded by intense competition in a shrinking
market. Yet there are no obvious alternative sources of strong profits
growth. In personal computers, IBM lost ground to smaller, more nimble
rivals in the late 1980s, and while it has made a strong recovery, profit
margins are razor thin.
In workstations, it is engaged in a technology race against Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment, which have the
advantage of more focused marketing efforts. In the mid-range computer
segment, IBM's AS/400 is under attack from 'open systems' vendors offering
computers that adhere to industry standards.
One bright spot is IBM's services business, which advises companies on
computing needs and is increasing revenues rapidly, although profits are
less buoyant.
At present, Mr Gerstner's strategic approach seems to be one of letting a
thousand flowers bloom. He says he does not 'believe there is, or ever will
be, a single technology strategy' for IBM's various businesses.
As for the long-contentious question of how IBM should organise its sales
force - by product, industry sector, or showing a single face to the buyer -
Mr Gerstner says there should be room for all, depending on what individual
customers want.
His remarks are peppered with references to customer satisfaction, but many
observers wonder how this can be divorced from the enunciation of a clear
technology strategy for the group.
IBM's customers are already nervous, wondering which product lines Mr
Gerstner may drop and competitors have been quick to take advantage of this
uncertainty.
'Technology is not high on my priority list of things to fix. IBM still has
the best technology in the world,' he says, echoing the self-confident view
expressed by Mr Akers not long before the profits slide began.
But however clever IBM's scientists may be, the company has of late picked
few technological winners and has been slow bringing new products to market.
This has begun to erode the confidence of customers who have traditionally
looked to IBM as a large, reliable source of machines and advice in an
industry changing at bewildering pace.
Mr Gerstner would appear to be treading a fine line: cost-cutting may
restore profits in the short-run, yet if IBM fails to articulate a
technology strategy, it risks further undermining its status as an industry
leader.
It is not yet 'just another computer company' - a purveyor of products which
could have been made by one of a dozen rivals. But it could become so if it
focuses on the problems of the past rather than building a strategy for the
future.

FT  29 JUL 93 / BT warns despite advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 757m in the
quarter to June 30, a 3 per cent increase.
The comparable figure left aside the effects of selling non-core businesses,
on which a Pounds 135m loss was incurred. First quarter turnover rose 2.9
per cent to Pounds 3.34bn (Pounds 3.24bn).
Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, described the results as 'encouraging,
showing growth in both UK and international call volumes'.
But he sounded a warning note on the regulatory and competitive pressures
faced by BT.
Under an agreement with the telecoms watchdog Oftel, BT is obliged to reduce
prices for core services to a figure 7.5 per cent below the retail prices
index for the coming 12 months. Nearly 60 per cent of BT's revenue will be
affected.
Analysts also expect BT to lose about 3 per cent of UK market share over the
next year, as Mercury - which has about 10 per cent - and cable TV companies
make advances in the residential market.
Oftel is considering plans which could improve terms for competitors to
connect with the BT network.
Revenue from international calls rose nearly 15 per cent to Pounds 499m
during the quarter, and there was an 8 per cent rise in income from
telephone line rentals to Pounds 595m. Inland traffic was flat at Pounds
1.26bn. Using a 12-month moving average, inland call turnover growth was 2
per cent up, but discount packages and the effect of last year's Oftel price
cap kept revenue static.
Capital spending on plant and property fell from Pounds 492m to Pounds 467m.
BT denied that there had been a decision to invest less at home following
the company's recent Dollars 4.3bn purchase of a stake in MCI, the second
largest US carrier. It said that two thirds of UK customer lines were now
connected to digital telephone exchanges.
As at June 30, BT employed 169,500 people, down 1,200 in the quarter,
cutting staff costs by 3.7 per cent. A further 30,000 posts are to be shed
over the next two years.
Operating costs increased 1.9 per cent to Pounds 2.52bn, largely as a result
of increased payments to overseas operators for delivery of international
calls.
Earnings per share rose from an adjusted 7.8p to 7.9p.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Cigarette cloud over BAT's 35% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, warned yesterday, that the
US cigarette price war 'is hurting us and its effects will continue to be
felt into 1994 and beyond'.
His comments came as the tobacco and financial services group reported a 35
per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 672m to Pounds
906m.
During the six months, the impact of the US cigarette price battle was
largely confined to a Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.3m) fall in the trading profits
of Brown and Williamson, BAT's US subsidiary, due to stock reductions.
However, BAT is to cut the price of its premium brands in the US next month
to match the discounting of Marlboro by Philip Morris and of Winston by RJ
Reynolds.
Overall trading profits from the tobacco business rose from Pounds 518m to
Pounds 623m on turnover of Pounds 5.63bn, against Pounds 5.51bn. Excluding a
one-off gain of Pounds 135m from the recent cigarette brands swap with
American Brands, profits declined 6 per cent, reflecting depressed economic
conditions in a number of international markets.
The group was also hit by unexpected losses at Eagle Star, its general
insurance subsidiary, on mortgage indemnity policies - covering mortgage
lenders against losses on sales of repossessed property - underwritten
between 1988 and 1990.
These losses amounted to Pounds 57m, offsetting profits of Pounds 45m from
other areas of Eagle Star's general and life insurance business. 'The surge
in mortgage claims took us by surprise both in terms of number and cost,'
said Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive.
Other areas of Eagle Star's general business showed improvement as a result
of a fall in weather and recession-related claims and rises in premium
rates. The group's home and motor insurance lines both recorded underwriting
profits. The improvement was in spite of expected claims of Pounds 24m from
the Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London.
Allied Dunbar, the group's UK life insurance arm, and Farmers Group, its US
subsidiary, helped boost profits from financial services to more than Pounds
300m.
Earnings were helped by a low tax charge of 29.6 per cent, following high
take-up of the enhanced share alternative to the cash dividend.
Earnings per share grew 66 per cent from 11.8p to 19.6p; and the interim
dividend is raised 8 per cent to 7.9p

FT  29 JUL 93 / This Is Your Life inspires Thames deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television, the independent television production company that lost
its ITV franchise, has struck a deal with the BBC worth more than Pounds 20m
over three years.
At the heart of the deal is This Is Your Life, a programme that started life
at the BBC 38 years ago, moved to ITV and will now move back to the BBC in
autumn 1994. The programme's simple formula is to take a celebrity by
surprise, and tell his or her life story through friends and family.
Thames, recently bought by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has been
attracting audiences of 12m to 14m for the programme. But ITV said yesterday
it felt unable to commit itself to the long-term deal that Thames was
seeking. The production company is already selling Pounds 40m of programmes
to ITV this year.
'ITV is keen to commission more programmes which appeal to young up-market
viewers, as well as to its established audience,' said the ITV Network
Centre. It is nudging its channel up-market at the very time that the BBC is
rediscovering the need to appeal to a broad audience to protect its
universally imposed licence fee.
The Thames deal also involves developing new drama and comedy ideas for the
BBC.
Mr Alan Yentob, controller of BBC 1, said he was luring a number of top
performers back from ITV in deals with independent producers.
They include comedy stars Rowan Atkinson and Dave Allen. SelecTv, producers
of the hit show Birds of a Feather, will be making a new comedy about a
hen-pecked husband who finds romance when he enters a 1940s time warp.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Rabin condemned for shelling: Clinton appeals to all parties
to halt conflict in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NABATIYEH, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S prime minister Yitzhak Rabin faced heavy criticism last night both
from his closest allies abroad and within his cabinet at home for the
four-day bombardment of southern Lebanon which has forced nearly 250,000
civilians to flee their homes.
The US, stepping up its efforts to end the fighting, criticised Israel for
targeting civilians and urged Syria to do more to stop the conflict, while
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, condemned
Israel's attack.
As Mr Rabin's Labour-led administration appeared increasingly isolated
internationally, a political crisis was looming in Israel as two parties
backing the coalition government strongly opposed continuing the offensive.
Two cabinet ministers, speaking on television on behalf of the left-wing
Meretz party which has 12 MPs, called for the shelling to cease immediately
and said they opposed Mr Rabin's objective of driving villagers out of
southern Lebanon. Unruly scenes also erupted in parliament, and an Arab MP,
who repeatedly harangued Mr Rabin, was expelled from the Knesset. The
five-strong Arab group of MPs was considering its future support for Mr
Rabin.
Mr Rabin pledged, however, to continue the offensive until Israel's security
interests were achieved, and said refugees fleeing the Israeli bombardment
of their villages would not be allowed to return home until rocket attacks
by pro-Iranian Hizbollah fighters ceased.
Yesterday marked the first direct criticism from the US.
President Bill Clinton called on Hizbollah to stop rocket attacks on Israel,
but also demanded that Israel stop its blitz of villages in southern Lebanon
which has left more than 100 people dead. The president also urged Syria 'to
go from showing restraint to being an active participant to try to stop the
fighting'.
US State Department officials were unusually severe in their criticism.
'It's clear that there have been attacks directed against civilians,' said
Mr Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman. He called the flood of
refugees 'deeply disturbing'. But he acknowledged there had also been
attacks directed against civilians in northern Israel.
The crushing bombardment and air attacks on the region continued for a
fourth day, as Israel directed its heavy artillery fire to the area south of
Tyre and shelled further north to broaden the area it effectively controls.
In Nabatiyeh, a town which has been under sustained attack, remaining
residents were trapped without transport and with dwindling food supplies.
Mr Rabin yesterday called on Syria to use its influence to curb the Islamic
fighters and said a dialogue with Damascus would open when Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, visits the region at the weekend.
Mr Rabin refused to say how long the operation would last. 'We are steadfast
in our decision to continue to act to achieve our aims,' he said.
Syria called for international pressure to force Israel to stop its attacks,
which official newspapers described as barbaric and a threat to regional
peace. President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon said the country was united against
the Israeli occupation.
An Israeli army spokesman in the border town of Metulla said that by
yesterday evening more than 14,500 shells had been fired into southern
Lebanon. Hizbollah fighters, massively overwhelmed by superior Israeli
firepower, continued to harass Israeli forces, launching 28 Katyusha
rockets.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Condon expects compromise on police reform proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS of possible compromise on police reform emerged yesterday when Mr Paul
Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was 'confident' that
some of the recommendations of the Sheehy report would not be implemented.
Mr Condon, Britain's most senior police officer, said he expected
consultations during the next two months to produce changes on pay and
conditions which would be in the public interest and fair to police
officers.
The comments of the commissioner, who has frequent contact with Mr Michael
Howard, home secretary, reflect a growing feeling among police chiefs that
the government will be prepared to dilute or abandon some of the more
far-reaching aspects of the Sheehy report.
The report, drawn up by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries,
recommends fixed-term contracts, performance-related pay, the abolition of
three ranks and changes to starting rates, overtime and pension
arrangements.
Mr Condon, speaking at the publication of the Metropolitan Police annual
report, said the police service had to be modernised, and he believed it was
already at the forefront of change in the public sector. Much of the
analysis by Sir Patrick and his committee was good. But the recommendations
for constables and sergeants were flawed and not in the public interest.
He identified recommendations for short-term contracts, a Pounds 2,000 a
year reduction in starting salaries and pension changes as proposals that
would undermine rank-and-file officers.
The police, Mr Condon said, faced an unsettling time and he did not want
them to spend the next two years worrying about pay and conditions. 'The
sooner we can get settled down with a sensible package the better.'
Mr Howard, who is holding talks on the Sheehy proposals until September, is
almost certain to press ahead with fixed-term contracts for senior officers.
But chief constables argue the committee's proposal to put all ranks on
10-year contracts could discourage high-quality recruits from joining the
police.
Many senior officers are reconciled to the introduction of
performance-related pay, but regard the Sheehy report's proposed approach as
too mechanistic.
The Metropolitan Police report showed crime in the capital relatively
static, with 944,200 offences reported. There was a small, 1 per cent fall
in burglaries - the first for five years.

FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England was lucky in its timing of the latest gilts auction. It
coincided both with the currency tension in Europe, which has given sterling
a safe haven status, and with heightened expectations of lower interest
rates following Tuesday's CBI survey. There is no doubt that these factors
boosted demand, especially since the market was over-sold last week in the
run up to the sale.
Sterling's strength may prove less of a support if calm returns to the ERM
following today's Bundesbank council meeting. Base rate hopes may continue
to shore up short gilt prices for a while, providing the Bank with
additional funding opportunities. That would reinforce the impression that
its efforts are concentrated towards the short end of the maturity spectrum
where rates are cheaper. Although the Bank has carefully eschewed the US
example of making this an explicit policy, it may still worry that borrowing
over 25 years at rates around 8 per cent implies little faith in its own
anti-inflation stance. Or it may simply believe that borrowing long could
become cheaper still.
But the luxury of choice is limited. Recent auctions have met heavy demand
from overseas buyers who favour short to medium-dated stock. Eventually this
demand will abate. The Bank may then have to target domestic institutions
who prefer long-dated paper. The risk is that something could have happened
by then - like the first sign of higher wage inflation, for example - to
have sent the gilt market's rally into reverse.

FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Abbey Life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The inexorable rise of bancassurance has been at least slowed by recession.
Black Horse Financial Services, which sells to Lloyds Bank customers, had
little more luck selling regular premium savings products in the first half
of the year than other life insurance companies. Unit trust sales took up
the slack as savers moved out of low-yielding deposit accounts. But that
business offers lower margins than selling traditional life products, and
might be expected to tail off.
The question, then, is whether Black Horse will regain momentum as the
economy turns. The tougher disclosure rules proposed by the Treasury might
help. Lower administration and sales costs should be more of a competitive
advantage once customers are presented with such information in clear terms.
This is assuming Black Horse can come up with a convincing formula of what
its sales costs are. But having made an initial trawl through its captive
audience of Lloyds' customers, it may find winning new business tougher from
here on.

Sir Patrick Sheehy's lot is not a happy one. With Philip Morris playing
merry havoc in the US cigarette market, the Bishopsgate bomb blowing a
Pounds 24m hole in Eagle Star's profits, and the cumulative losses from
mortgage indemnity insurance climbing towards Pounds 1bn, BAT has suffered
its fair share of setbacks. Great though these concerns may be, however,
they still represent relatively minor pinpricks in BAT's thick corporate
hide. Sir Patrick's greater grouse must be that the stock market steadfastly
refuses to ascribe a 'fair' value to BAT's underlying cash stream. The wave
of negative sentiment has largely obscured the marked cyclical upswing in
BAT's insurance business.
Despite the recent bounce, BAT's shares have still underperformed the market
by 12 per cent since the start of the year, while the composite insurance
sector has outperformed by 6 per cent. Despite praiseworthy efforts to
release shareholder value, BAT remains a stock market anomaly. Applying a
pure tobacco company multiple to the earnings BAT derives from tobacco
suggests its insurance interests are seriously undervalued. The reverse
exercise of valuing BAT's insurance businesses, however, implies its tobacco
interests are almost thrown in for free.
A minority flotation of BAT's tobacco businesses would surely represent one
means of realising additional value. Yet it seems doubtful BAT would take
the step without external stimulus. Sir James Goldsmith, where are you now?

FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Drug dealing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The frenzy of deal-making among pharmaceutical companies is a recognition
that returns on investment in new drugs will be lower than in the past.
Making the most of existing products and looking for profits elsewhere is a
natural response. Governments taking a tough line on the cost of
prescription medicines are also encouraging patients to buy medicines
over-the-counter. So the triple alliance between Wellcome, Glaxo and
Warner-Lambert has a compelling logic.
Merck has already addressed the OTC market by linking with Johnson &amp;
Johnson. Its decision to spend Dollars 6bn buying one of its biggest
customers is more difficult to fathom. Such vertical integration has worked
in other markets, but it remains open to question whether Medco can defend
its share of mail-order medicines once its independence is called into
question. Mr Richard Markham, who resigned unexpectedly as Merck's chief
executive earlier this month, may have harboured similar doubts.
Both Wellcome and Glaxo are surrendering profits from potential OTC
medicines - based on the Zovirax anti-viral treatment and ulcer drug Zantac
respectively - in exchange for Warner-Lambert's experience and clout in
consumer marketing. But while Wellcome is taking an equity stake in what
will be one of the world's largest consumer healthcare companies, Glaxo is
sticking resolutely to its guns as a prescription drugs company. If that
dispels lingering fears of a big acquisition in consumer healthcare, so much
the better.
Zovirax has already won OTC approval in several countries and should have a
free run of several years before competition comes along. An indigestion
remedy based on Zantac is at best three years away - pending regulatory
approval, which is by no means certain - and could be second or third on to
the market. The 4 per cent rise in Wellcome's share price yesterday, against
a 2 per cent rise in Glaxo, thus looks a measured response. The days when
prescription drugs companies could afford to look down on margins earned in
consumer markets have clearly passed.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Personal View: Why the EMS deserves an early burial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLIVIER BLANCHARD, RUDIGER DORNBUSCH, STANLEY FISCHER, FRANCO
MODIGLIANI, PAUL A SAMUELSON and ROBERT SOLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current turmoil in the currency markets and the broader crisis of rising
unemployment in Europe is the most striking evidence yet that European
monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements are profoundly
counter-productive.
By far the most important factor responsible for this debacle is the
Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates, combined with certain features
of the European Monetary System which have forced other member countries to
follow suit: these include the mobility of capital across member countries
and the fact that central banks have interpreted the rules of the exchange
rate mechanism to require not only the maintenance of fixed exchange rates
but also the avoidance of parity adjustments.
The result of high interest rates across Europe has been that unemployment
has risen to record levels. Governments have done little but seek a variety
of excuses for the loss of jobs. It looks as if the 1930s are being
re-enacted. Then, it was felt to be imperative to hang on to gold at any
price: today the feeling is to hang on to the D-Mark.
It is not useful to spend too much time allocating blame - on a Bundesbank
that fights inflation of 'only' 4 per cent, on EMS member countries such as
France, which opts for a hard currency at the price of an entirely
unwarranted recession, or on a country like Spain, which believes that being
in Europe means being a member of the ERM.
In our view, the essential issue is for the EMS countries to shift
priorities, putting unemployment at the top of the list and recognising that
much labour can be reabsorbed through reflationary policies, beginning with
a sharp cut in interest rates.
Of course, countries would have to accept the depressing implications that
such a move would have on their exchange rate with the D-Mark, without
committing their reserves in an attempt to support the current parity. This
means they must be prepared to see their exchange rates fall below their
lower limits, and hence face ejection from the ERM.
Ideally it might be hoped that France would take the initiative by slashing
interest rates and letting the franc float. Other European countries,
including Belgium and Spain, would follow. At this point two possible
scenarios are conceivable: the first is that, faced with the prospect of a
sharp loss in competitiveness, Germany would limit the damage by cutting
interest rates. Within just a few weeks the long-awaited cut in European
interest rates would have materialised.
Second, the Bundesbank would refuse to cut rates beyond another token
amount, and then Germany would be left alone in the ERM (thereby floating
too). This would mean the end of the EMS as presently constituted. But this
should not be a cause for regret.
To be sure, there was a time when the ERM, with fixed parities and
Bundesbank leadership, performed a very useful function. But in their quest
for moderate inflation, countries adopted an unwavering D-Mark peg, which is
now becoming a problem.
There is no reason to equate yielding on existing ERM parities with
sacrificing the entire anti-inflationary effort of the 1980s. France has no
inflation problem - unlike Germany. France can, therefore, afford to do
without the recession which the Bundesbank feels it must impose on Germany.
Spain has a phenomenal unemployment problem which should be the immediate
focus of attention, not a currency peg that is killing growth and
prosperity.
Some might bemoan the ensuing incapacitation of the EMS as a rude shock to
the dream of European unity. But such a concern is unwarranted.
First, the central element of the European Community is the set of common
market institutions, and these should and would remain in place even if the
EMS were temporarily impaired. Second, the existing European monetary system
is already in tatters. Thus, leaving the present system would only
acknowledge a truth that many in Europe refuse to face. Forsaking the
present arrangements is the only way to move quickly towards a new European
monetary system in which a crisis such as the current one cannot be
repeated.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Muscle behind a counter offensive: Tony Jackson examines the
logic behind a link-up of three of the world's biggest drug companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, RICHARD WATERS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's triple alliance between Glaxo, Warner-Lambert and Wellcome is
striking evidence of an industry under pressure. Around the world,
governments have declared war on the cost of prescription drugs. Companies
have responded by ransacking their cupboards for medicines that can be sold
direct to the consumer without prescription. The link-up in over-the-counter
(OTC) drugs between three of the world's big drug groups, while the most
ambitious to date, is unlikely to be the last.
The most obvious effect of the industry's shift in strategy is to transfer
power from the scientist to the marketing man. In terms of prescription
drugs, Warner-Lambert is much the weakest of the three companies. But it is
a giant in US consumer markets. Its advertising budget is the 11th largest
in the US, supporting products such as Listerine mouth wash and Benylin
cough syrup. It also has a 600-strong US sales force, and OTC sales around
the world of Dollars 1.2bn. Wellcome has OTC sales of Dollars 400m and sells
mostly through brokers. Glaxo has no OTC products and no sales force. It is
therefore Warner-Lambert which dominates the joint venture.
This is despite the fact that, by common consent of the parties, the chief
attraction of the deal lies in forthcoming OTC products from Glaxo and
Wellcome. Glaxo's Zantac, an ulcer treatment, is the biggest-selling
prescription drug in the world. Zovirax, Wellcome's anti-viral treatment, is
the eighth biggest. The aim is to sell Zantac as an indigestion pill, and
Zovirax as a cream for cold sores or - in the US - as a pill for genital
herpes.
Mr John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, explained the logic yesterday.
'The difference between the economics of prescription drugs and OTC
medicines is that in prescription drugs, your big costs come before you
reach the market. With an OTC product it's the other way round. The
marketing cost in year one can be as big as your revenues, and it can take
seven or eight years to get your pay-out.'
Therefore, said Mr Robb, the trick is to build up consumer awareness of the
drug in its last years on prescription. That way, it has a flying start when
it is converted to OTC. Wellcome claims to have done this with its cough
medicines Actifed and Sudafed, and to be doing it now with Zovirax. Indeed,
all but one of the top 15 OTC medicines launched in the US since 1975 have
been former prescription drugs.
But it needs the marketing muscle of a Warner-Lambert to hustle them along.
'With their operation behind us,' Mr Robb said, 'we're likely to get a much
faster lift-off and better penetration with Zovirax than we would do through
a handful of brokers. And Warner-Lambert can buy advertising much more
cheaply, and get more shelf space.'
Since Mr Robb is himself a consumer marketing man by training, it is hard to
believe he does not chafe at being junior partner in the venture. But he
treats the fact stoically. 'I couldn't see any other way into it. We are
just not in the first flight of consumer marketing companies, and it would
take a huge investment to get there. There is no one you could think of
making a hostile bid for, and no pharmaceutical company wants to sell its
OTC business. And as OTC approvals for Zovirax started coming through, we
risked missing the market opportunity.'
When it comes to Glaxo, the motivation is more complex. Its negotiations
with Warner-Lambert began independently from Wellcome's. Its strategy was
also very different: indeed, strategic differences within Glaxo may have
contributed to the abrupt and somewhat mysterious departure in March of Dr
Ernest Mario, Glaxo's chief executive.
It was rumoured at the time that Dr Mario wanted to pursue outright merger
with Warner-Lambert. However, Glaxo's chairman, Sir Paul Girolami, remains a
stubborn advocate of the virtues of prescription medicines. Yesterday's deal
means that Glaxo will wash its hands of the OTC future of Zantac and its
other drugs, leaving their development to Warner-Lambert and Wellcome.
Dr Franz Humer, Glaxo's chief operating director, yesterday stuck to the
Glaxo line. It would be wrong to blame Dr Mario's departure on differences
over the deal, he said. The reasons for his departure were many and varied.
'We are convinced that the prescription drug market will continue to be a
very healthy and growing one,' he said. 'We want to concentrate all our
resources, and the Pounds 700m we spend on research and development, on
innovative ethical (ie: prescription) pharmaceuticals. This deal clearly
recognises that the know-how for running an OTC business belongs to
Warner-Lambert.'
Warner-Lambert itself is in no doubt of the value of its catch. Mr Mel
Goodes, the chairman, was clearly in a jubilant mood as he announced the
deals yesterday. While he refused to estimate the income that would flow to
his company from the agreements, he said 'in aggregate, they have the
potential of adding hundreds of millions of dollars to our annual sales
line'.
The company claims that a treatment for genital herpes which is available
for immediate purchase from a pharmacist would 'eliminate thousands of
doctor's visits' and give sufferers access to the product at an early stage
when it is most effective. This would make the switch of the product to OTC
status attractive, 'as governments look to curb their health care bills',
said Mr John Walsh, head of the company's consumer products division.
While the new joint venture will still rank only third in the world of OTC
products, behind Johnson &amp; Johnson and American Home Products, it ties in
with the strategy of extending the range of products sold through
Warner-Lambert's existing network, as enunciated by Mr Goodes soon after he
became chairman two years ago.
On the other hand, Zantac and Zovirax are unlikely to be on sale in the US
before 1996 at the earliest. According to Warner-Lambert yesterday, a
submission will be made to the US Food and Drug Administration in August to
sell OTC versions of both products, with approval expected in 1994 or 1995.
It might also be asked how profitable they will be. Despite Zantac's huge
success as the world's biggest prescription drug, when it comes to the OTC
market it will be entering a crowded field. SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, an
older ulcer drug with an almost identical action, has already been cleared
for OTC sale in the UK and has been submitted for clearance in the US. A
third drug with a similar action, Pepcid, has been submitted for OTC
approval in the US by Merck, the biggest prescription drug company in the
world.
According to Mr Robb of Wellcome, US margins on OTC medicines are good by
consumer product standards, though not by comparison with prescription
drugs. 'They shouldn't drop below 15 per cent before tax,' he said
yesterday. 'It would also be unusual if they went above 20 per cent. That's
very respectable. And who knows where prescription drug margins are going to
go? I suspect they'll be more under attack than the OTC side.'
However, past OTC margins need not be a guide to the future. It is worth
recalling that as recently as the late 1980s, drug companies thought the
answer to government pressure on prices was to merge their prescription
businesses, as SmithKline did with Beecham and Bristol-Myers did with
Squibb. Now, the trend is to get together with consumer groups. Thus, the
pharmaceuticals group Syntex has already formed a marketing alliance with
the consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble, and Merck has an OTC agreement
with Johnson &amp; Johnson.
The danger may therefore be that too many companies are heading the same way
at once. Collectively, the drug industry has enormous resources and huge
piles of spare cash. Now that their traditional prescription business is
under threat, the industry giants have the capacity to unleash consumer
marketing wars on an unnerving scale. In staying clear of the hurly-burly,
Glaxo is being typically contrarian. Just conceivably, though, it may have a
point.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Talk of the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK remains determined to tease Europe's currency speculators. By
cutting the repo rate by 20 basis point yesterday, the bank sent a strong
signal that a discount rate cut is imminent. It then announced that no press
conference is planned after today's council meeting. The absence of a press
conference need not imply that the bank does not intend to deliver the
interest rate cut which both Germany and Europe need. But the bank should
not be too clever: whatever it does will need careful explanation.
Yesterday's repo rate cut comes at the end of a fortnight or more in which
the parities in the exchange rate mechanism have been severely tested. It
also came the day after German headline inflation rose to 4.3 per cent,
twice its 1993 target, and a week after broad money growth rose to 7.1 per
cent, outside the bank's target range of 4.5-6.5 per cent. If the Bundesbank
fails to cut the discount rate, it will inevitably be accused of trying to
sabotage the ERM. If it does cut today, then, judged by its own lights, the
Bundesbank can also be accused of putting European politics above German
price stability
The Bundesbank can avoid both charges. First, the bank should reaffirm that
maintaining medium-term price stability in Germany remains its prime
objective and will not be compromised by efforts to preserve current ERM
parities. Second, it must show that a rate cut - of   3/4 of a point or more
 -is consistent with this medium-term objective. The explanation might run
like this:
The current rate of broad money growth and consumer price inflation will not
determine the medium-term inflation rate, although they will set the price
level at which inflation can be stabilised. Monetary growth is currently
above target because of public borrowing to finance the government's budget
deficit. Consumer price inflation is temporarily high, in large part,
because of the government's efforts to close this deficit by raising
indirect taxes and other charges.
The Bundesbank has tried, with much success, to offset this public demand
for credit by squeezing private sector credit demand in west Germany. Real
interest rates remain painfully high, private industry has suffered a severe
recession and producer prices are falling. But there is a limit to the
amount of damage that it is prudent to inflict to keep the overall price
level down.
What matters is that the bank prevent this short-term rise in inflation from
feeding into medium-term inflationary expectations. The evidence suggests
that inflationary expectations are currently depressed. Pay settlements in
the 1993 west German pay round averaged between 3 and 4 per cent. Long-term
interest rates have fallen by over 2 percentage points since their 1990 peak
and, at 6.6 per cent, are both below their long-run average and probably
consistent with the bank's medium-term inflation target.
The Bundesbank should, of course, raise short-term interest rates
immediately if long-term interest rates start to rise, wage inflation
accelerates or the government's fiscal targets are missed. But, for the
moment, Germany's inverted yield curve suggests a further cut in interest
rates is prudent. Such a rate cut may prove enough to save the French
franc's parity. But whether it does so is, ultimately, a matter for Paris,
not Frankfurt.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Lesson for Israel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HISTORY of the past 15 years suggests that Israel's latest onslaught
against southern Lebanon will again fail to achieve its main objective. In
1978 and 1982 Israel tried, at immense cost both to itself and to the people
of Lebanon, to rid that fractured country of hostile guerrilla forces. The
extent of those failures can be measured by the intensity of this week's
renewed offensive.
This time Israel wishes to achieve a huge movement of population from the
south. Latest estimates indicate that some 200,000 people have been driven
from their homes. The villages and towns they have evacuated are being
subjected to heavy shelling with the aim of making them uninhabitable. Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, believes that the mass of refugees
will create pressure on the governments of Lebanon and Syria to curb the
guerrilla activities of Hizbollah, the radical Shia faction, and its
Palestinian allies.
Mr Rabin is as misguided about this as he was in December when he ordered
415 Palestinians to be deported from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. That
action, and this week's more extreme military assault, not only threaten the
faltering Middle East peace process but also play into the hands of those
most opposed to it.
More damaging still, the punishment being inflicted on the civilians of
Lebanon invites comparisons with what is happening in Bosnia. The forcible
movement of entire populations, in defiance of international appeals, is not
only morally indefensible but must also increase suspicions among Moslems
that the West is at best indifferent, at worst hostile to them.
This is a propaganda gift to radical Islamic movements and governments,
particularly Iran, which since the 1982 invasion has sustained and armed
Hizbollah under the guise of aiding a national liberation movement. It has
been having similar success in the other occupied territories, where Hamas
is increasingly challenging the influence of the more moderate Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
The lesson for Israel appears to be that the harsher its response to
security challenges, the greater will be the radicalisation of the
populations it is seeking to control. And it is precisely those populations
which will ultimately decide the fate of the peace process.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, will shortly begin another
visit to the region, aiming to move peace negotiations forward. For that to
happen, Israel must be persuaded to make an explicit commitment to withdraw
from the territory it occupies, in return for peace treaties with its
neighbours. It is the only way to reverse the increasingly dangerous
radicalisation of the region.

The plebs rarely attend AGMs of Caledonian Investments, the publicly quoted
arm of Lord Cayzer's family fortune. But yesterday's affair was even more
rarefied than usual. What on earth was John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner
of Cazenove, going on about when he lapsed into Latin during the customary
vote of thanks?
Cayzer family retainers note that the last time it happened was in 1987 when
Kemp-Welch uttered a dictum which translated roughly as 'the past has been
magnificent but let us hope that the best is yet to come'.
But what inspired his latest outburst, ending with the immortal words 'nihil
adhuc non vidistia' - was the Wykehamist broker reflecting the wisdom of
Pliny, Horace . . . or whom?
More like Ronald Reagan, Kemp-Welch admits.

Meanwhile the Wickert Institute, which regularly polls the Germans on
anything from their political preferences to how often they laugh, has just
discovered that one in three of them is bothered by fellow-citizens'
'disagreeable perfume'.
The sniffiest are the unmarried; those in wedlock being 'mostly less exposed
to bodily contact or simply more tolerant', the institute somewhat arcanely
explains.
There are also differences by occupation. For example, only 30 per cent of
farmers, no doubt distracted by earthier smells, make complaints about such
olfactory offences. But those paradigms of pedantry, public officials, turn
up their noses at the rate of 49 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next to a hole in the head, there's surely nothing the Brits need like the
latest sociological yardstick produced by Mori opinion polls - a monthly
Misery Index.
Alas, the FT can't claim to be free of blame for the development, because
the misery measure is calculated from the fear of redundancy index printed
in this paper together with the economic optimism index published in The
Times.
The combined result represents the average numbers of people polled
expecting further recession and either potentially or actually out of a job.
What it shows is that the national heart is steadily sinking, now up to 33
per cent last month from April's 27 per cent, with all ages and classes as
well as both sexes becoming equally steeped in gloom.
Indeed, the only exceptions to the uniformly unhappy pattern are the Scots.
They're gloomier still.

Will Gianni Locatelli, Italy's rising media star, find his next challenge as
easy to master as his last one?
During his editorship of Sole 24, Italy's pink financial daily, sales have
doubled and the paper has become essential reading.
But RAI, Italy's state broadcasting corporation, could be a far tougher nut
to crack. As the new director-general, Locatelli inherits an organisation
which exhibits one of the most flagrant examples of the way the political
parties carved up the institutions of state.
The Christian Democrats control the main TV channel, the Socialists the
second and the third has been handed as a sop to what were once Communists.
Locatelli's brief is not only to introduce greater objectivity in news and
limit the politicking but also to tackle the organisation's disastrous
finances and overblown staff. This could mean cutting the number of state
channels to two, and preparing for a more general broadcasting reform that
would also reduce Silvio Berlusconi's near monopolistic grip on commercial
television.
It makes John Birt's job at the BBC look a doddle.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Observer: Strong soap washed out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British public's excitement at their prime minister's use of the word
'bastards' must be incomprehensible to the Brazilians, who plainly look for
stronger entertainment at the hands of their politicians.
For example, they have long been breathlessly awaiting a new television soap
opera called The Maharajah. Scheduled for prime-time screening, it weaves
newsreel footage of the rise and fall of the impeached Fernando Collor into
a plot about a woman reporter stumbling across a financial scam intended to
keep a head of state in power for 30 years.
Oddly enough, not only does the actor in the name role bear a remarkable
likeness to the disgraced ex-president, but the actress playing the
Maharajah's wife closely resembles the country's former first lady. Since
the word 'Collor' never occurs in any of the episodes, however, the
producers believed they would escape legal difficulties.
The belief has just been rudely shattered. To the dismay of the country's TV
viewers, the courts have granted an injunction banning the screening to
lawyers acting for Collor, who's now awaiting criminal trial on corruption
charges.
Nevertheless, the producers aren't letting the banners get them down.
They're confident their lawyers will soon get the injunction overturned,
they say, and the publicity generated by the legal battle will set the
soap-loving Brazilians positively bubbling with expectation.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Local government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a common fallacy in politics that doing whatever the public says it
wants will be popular. The reverse is often the case: seeking to please
everybody can produce policies satisfying nobody. The Local Government
Commission is discovering this in reviewing local government structures in
England outside the large conurbations.
The commission has so far produced five reports recommending the replacement
of 66 county and district councils with 24 unitary councils. In areas such
as Durham and Derbyshire, they will be based on counties; in others such as
Somerset and Gloucestershire, local government will be based on smaller
districts. To complete the mosaic, two tiers of local government will remain
in Lincolnshire, with district councils for street-level services and a
county council for strategic services.
The commission's chairman, Sir John Banham, says the recommendations are
based on people's feelings about where they belong. Since they are based on
extensive polling of the population under review, that cannot be denied. Yet
the proposals for unitary authorities appear to find little favour in the
areas concerned.
Unsurprisingly, the loudest objections come from the councils to be
abolished under the recommendations. But business leaders have also been
scathing about creating small unitary authorities in areas such as Bristol
and Middlesbrough unable to think strategically for urban areas forming
single economic entities. And local residents' meetings say the larger
unitary authorities that are proposed will be too remote to provide
responsive services such as street cleaning and refuse removal.
Disturbed by the rising hubbub, the government is considering changes to the
commission's remit. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, should
ruminate on a MORI poll in Derbyshire as part of the review. Only 3 per cent
of those questioned said sense of community should be an important factor in
shaping local government. Much more important were a structure responsive to
the wishes of local people, and the cost and quality of service.
This reinforces the need for a more coherent approach to the commission's
work. England needs a system of local government that is capable of
strategic action, can deliver local services responsively and is locally
accountable. A two-tier model is the best way to achieve this, with larger
strategic county councils and smaller districts to provide services. Yet
this is the model the commission is largely scrapping. In reviewing its
remit, Mr Gummer should abandon the opinion poll and reinstate reason as the
driving force behind local government organisation.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Sheehy view on police 'patent nonsense'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S J BEATTIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Patrick Sheehy's defence of his Report into Police Responsibilities
and Rewards (Personal View, July 26) is so full of holes that he ought to be
embarrassed. To take just one point - the introduction of 10-year,
fixed-term appointments, then subsequently five-year terms. That this would
not undermine the attraction of the police service as a vocation is patent
nonsense.
Sir Patrick reveals that the expiry of the fixed terms would be used to get
rid of officers only on the grounds of medical unfitness, gross misconduct,
manifest incompetence or severance on structural grounds. He is not in a
position to give such a guarantee and why should every single officer in the
police service be placed under the psychological duress that a renewable
fixed term appointment must bring?
It is not beyond any commercial or public sector organisation to devise
procedures and systems which dispense with unsatisfactory employees on these
grounds, but without having to wave the threat of failure to renew a
fixed-term appointment. What Sir Patrick proposes does not apply in the rest
of industry and is a carte blanche for management to control officers by
fear and nepotism. This is no way to motivate or inspire officers.
I also have to make the point that even where contracts apply in other
industries, terminated employees at least have the chance of re-employment
with other firms and industries. There is only one police service, with its
unique training skills and experience. After 10 years or more, officers are
simply not equipped or young enough to be trained for alternative
employment. That is why the police federations are logically (as well as
emotionally) appalled at Sir Patrick's failure to understand the police
service.

Sir, It is clearly Proms season in your letters column too. I was delighted
to be reminded of that long-forgotten work, Pascal's Wagner (Letters, July
26). Too gloomy and Germanic, however, to be representative of a
now-reviving French philosophical-cum-musical tradition which always put the
accent on lightness of touch, risk and extravagance. To redress matters, I
hope to read that you will shortly be announcing the new production of
Descartes' Ditties (arr. Attali). The first one goes: 'Je depense, donc je

<TEXT>
OPENING OF THE APARTHEID MIND
By Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley
University of California Press, Dollars 25 It is sometimes hard for
outsiders to reconcile the contradictory visions of South Africa which
assail them in TV images and in newspaper headlines. There is the South
Africa of the negotiating chamber, where the two main black and white
parties are still co-operating to produce a new, democratic constitution
ahead of the country's first multiracial elections next April. Then there is
the other South Africa: a country of horrific violence and mounting social
dislocation, of economic decline, political collapse and threats of civil
war.
To which country does the future belong? According to Heribert Adam and
Kogila Moodley, a husband and wife team of sociologists, probably not
altogether to either. In this book, they offer a more carefully nuanced
portrait in which apartheid oppression is replaced not by true democracy but
by a multiracial, but still authoritarian, oligarchy of the centre,
challenged by similarly multiracial extremes of the left and right.
For the foreseeable future, they argue, South Africa will be ruled by a
self-selecting elite - black as well as white - in the name above all of
law, order and economic development. The leadership of the African National
Congress, in other words, will be happily co-opted into the existing
structures of white power, dissenters crushed, and legitimacy sought through
popular referendums if it cannot be secured through elections.
Adam and Moodley, though now resident in Canada, have an impressive record
as commentators on, and anticipators of, South Africa's political evolution.
Adam's 1971 book, Modernising Racial Domination, accurately foresaw the
changes in the ruling National party during the 1970s; in 1986 they
predicted a historic accommodation between the Nats and the ANC.
Their latest oeuvre, like its predecessors, is not an easy read. It is
irritatingly full of sociology-speak (what, for example, is 'the abdicating
relativism of the postmodernists'?) and its argument is poorly organised to
a point which may deter the uninitiated reader.
But it could well prove every bit as prescient. Indeed, in many respects the
process it outlines is already well advanced: this is essentially what the
ANC and the government mean when they talk these days of 'power-sharing'.
Adam and Moodley describe their political alliance - the driving force of
the multi-party talks - as a forced and loveless marriage. Just as neither
could defeat the other in the 1980s, neither can rule without the other in
the 1990s.
That the people who matter on both sides recognise this fact is in itself
remarkable. As the book shows in a lucid account of the road from
confrontation to negotiation, it testifies to the Afrikaners' well-developed
instinct for self-preservation.
It was this instinct which prompted them to seek talks when international
events (settlement of regional conflicts with the end of the cold war) and
domestic pressures (the mounting costs of apartheid) were for the first time
combining to make compromise seem both feasible and acceptable. 'Few ruling
groups in history have ever wriggled themselves out of a deadly predicament
more elegantly,' the authors observe.
The wriggling is far from over yet, of course. The two sides, for all their
procedural progress, have not been able to agree how to define
power-sharing. Before elections will be conceivable, the ANC and the
National party will have to reach a more precise understanding - preferably
together with Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party - on the powers of
regional government. And even if the outstanding constitutional issues are
resolved in time, it is open to doubt whether elections can happen while
anarchy and violence still stalk the townships.
The authors' scepticism about the prospects for democracy goes deeper than
that. They wonder how, having secured a stake in power, ANC leaders will
exercise it. They worry that high black expectations for change will rapidly
clash with economic reality, and that the elite will sink into corruption. A
persistently sluggish economy would worsen political tensions and exacerbate
South Africa's manifold social ills; the result could be a multiracial class
war between urbanised, employed 'insiders' and the dispossessed of the
hostels and squatter camps. Such conflict, rather than tribal strife, say
the authors, is one element in the current fighting between the ANC and
Inkatha.
As the country drifts further into ungovernability, restoring order will
become the government's - any government's - top imperative: 'If a new
suppression of white and black violent extremism were perceived as
essential, a multiracial emergency coalition could crush opposition even
more effectively than the old racial minority regime. After all, the ANC has
tortured its dissidents and spies almost as gruesomely as the apartheid
police.'
Nevertheless, Opening of the Apartheid Mind suggests that none of the gloomy
parallels most often sketched is quite accurate. South Africa is unlikely to
suffer the mass exodus of white civil servants that afflicted Zimbabwe, for
example, and in any case has a much more vibrant private business sector.
Even under apartheid, it was a more integrated society than the former
Yugoslavia; the hatreds between the majority of blacks and whites do not
bear comparison with those between Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Moslems. On the
contrary, the authors identify among South Africans of all colours a
promising sense of common purpose that transcends the discredited group
identities imposed by apartheid. In that lies perhaps the strongest reason
to hope that South Africa is not doomed to become another African disaster
story.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Claims on London's taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER TOMPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Wealth, as measured by local gross domestic product, relates not merely
to the local population ('London's tax burden criticised', July 27). In the
reported comparison by the Centre for Economics and Business Research,
London's GDP of Dollars 122bn is attributed to its 6.8m inhabitants. Yet a
much larger population depends on London for its income. The Home Counties
send hundreds of thousands of workers into the metropolis daily to work. It
is inevitable that the crude London GDP per capita should be much higher
than the British average.
Certainly, London has a good claim to a fair return from the Treasury for
taxes paid by staff and businesses. So in part does the larger population on
which London depends for its success. This is one reason why taxes exceed
public expenditure in London and other urban centres. The challenge in
public spending is to arbitrate between the conflicting demands of business
and people for funds to be channelled to their needs.

Sir, Ms Mary Campbell (Letters, July 27) claims that only rich (uncaring)
parents would benefit from tax deductable child care. I am not rich but I
can see the immediate benefit of paying less tax, or of being taxed only
once. My salary is taxed, I pay the child minder and then she is taxed, so
the money I earn is being taxed twice. A bit like VAT really, isn't it? And
does Ms Campbell truly believe that the government would increase child
benefit at a time when it is looking at ways to reduce its social security
budget?
Surely this argument is all swings and roundabouts anyway. Either the
government loses/pays more money and working parents benefit or working
parents continue to pay more money and the government benefits. Ann Thwaite,

FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Assessments of BS 5750 ignore quality assurance
principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Like many others, I am concerned about the issues addressed by Charles
Batchelor in his article on BS 5750 ('A victim of its own success', July
21). However, I believe much of the criticism of BS 5750 centres around the
costs and management of the certification process, rather than the quality
assurance principles that the standard was originally designed to focus on.
Many of the articles in the business press have little to say about this
more important subject.
Having just achieved BS 5750:Part 1 registration for one of our businesses,
my company's experience is that BS 5750 has given us a disciplined approach
for establishing a documented quality management system, resulting in:
a sound foundation on which to continue to build improvements to our client
service;
a model for reviewing our operational procedures, which gives everyone a
common understanding of how we deliver our services;
an opportunity to ensure that we consistently deliver the same service
throughout our UK business by auditing our procedures;
an ongoing requirement to review our quality management systems and change
them in response to external demands.
Perhaps one way to enhance the credibility of BS 5750 would be to establish
assessment criteria requiring evaluation of customer feed-back on the
effectiveness of a company's service and the quality of its products or
services.
After all, the main reason for focusing on quality must surely be
continually to improve customer service.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't take risks on UK's good luck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one criticism that the UK chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, does not
deserve: that is for having done and said little since he became chancellor.
Considering the sluggish world economy and severe European recession, the
British economy is doing remarkably well. In these circumstances, the adage
'Leave well alone' applies. UK output is growing faster than most
forecasters expected, but not so fast as to constitute an inflationary
threat. And prices and costs are performing almost miraculously. Total
demand in money terms is growing very much in line with expectations, but
the division between real growth and inflation has turned out better.
The base rate cut being pressed by the industrial lobbies would be putting
this good fortune gratuitously at risk. It should be saved for possible use
later against any excessive sterling appreciation.
Of course, the UK recovery is patchy and the sectors that have not benefited
have successfully communicated their pessimism to the Bank of England. That
is the nature of the early stages of recovery.
Not only is the UK economy expanding more quickly than expected. But growth
has been export led to a surprising extent, which is not bad in current
circumstances. The deterioration in export prospects alleged in the July CBI
survey is derived more from fallible business predictions - such as those
which lay behind premature talk of 'green shoots' - than from hard questions
about orders and deliveries.
Gavyn Davies, one of the members of the chancellor's forecasting panel
hitherto most worried about the balance of payments, now admits that the
export figures are better than he had expected. He says a trade deficit will
not be a problem while GDP growth remains strong and inflation is subdued.
For, with a high-growth, low-inflation economy, the returns on inward
investment in the UK remain high.
The rise in manufacturing productivity in 1993 looks like being at least as
high as in the best year of the 1980s. Earnings increases in manufacturing,
on the other hand, have fallen to 5 per cent per annum - 3 3/4 per cent for
the whole economy - a rate which would previously have been unbelievable. As
a result, unit labour costs in manufacturing are now actually falling by
over 3 per cent per annum, something not seen since the present series
began. Yet this has been achieved without anything like as hard a squeeze on
profit margins as in the early 1980s.
There is now both a less inflationary culture and a more flexible labour
market, which may explain why unemployment started to fall much earlier than
expected, in contrast to the Continent.
The foundations for this success were laid by two highly unpopular policies.
First there were Nigel Lawson's interest rate increases in the last 17
months of his chancellorship, which took base rates up to 15 per cent and
led a howling media-mob to his country residence. Second there was the
Major-Lamont insistence on sticking to ERM membership for two years to
September 1992 which led to yet more media hostility.
The cumulative effect of both policies was more severe than intended. But
they made possible the remarkably successful onslaught on inflation and the
present highly competitive cost position, a platform for future growth. As
regards supporting these policies in these columns: Je ne regrette rien.
The obvious danger to continued success is the European currency turmoil on
Britain's doorstep. It is in no one's interest that the remainder of the ERM
should break up. The UK was able to get away with a successful devaluation,
partly because it was so obviously unplanned and unintended, and partly
because the market consensus was that sterling was overvalued. Even so, all
it did was to put the seal on cost improvements achieved by years of squeeze
and slog.
There is no future in each European country trying to steel a march on its
neighbours by competitive devaluation. The key to European recovery is a
monetary policy in the interests of the whole continent and not one defined
by a mechanistic monetarist view of Germany's interest. German monetary
policy will undoubtedly be relaxed much more under the pressure of
recession. The question is whether the Bundesbank moves fast enough to meet
current needs.
In the longer run, the removal of obstacles to employing workers, in the
shape of hiring, firing and overhead costs - and to the movements of goods
across the former Iron Curtain - will be more important for European growth.
But decades of perverse policy, which the Christian Democrat parties have
been too 'politically correct' to oppose, cannot be reversed in a few weeks.
And in any case a single market will require some basis of currency
stability, whatever happens to the ERM in the immediate future.
Meanwhile, the task is to put the British economy in the best possible shape
to weather any European storms and to exploit the European recovery which
will one day come.
If there is one economic number that a large proportion of the British
public knows, it is the Pounds 50bn the government expects to borrow this
financial year. City gloomsters have conveniently forgotten that perhaps
Pounds 20bn of the deficit goes to capital spending. If they would then
subtract another part due to recession, they would be left with something
that could be readily financed, even disregarding privatisation receipts.
Fiscal puritans, moreover, overlook what Norman Lamont left behind: a
cumulative Pounds 10bn per annum of additional tax increases due to come
into effect over the next two financial years. Vague knowledge of these is
already restraining consumer spending. The UK needs tax increases in the
November Budget on top of that as much as it does a hole in the head.
The national Budget is not quite the same as a family budget. One of its
jobs is to offset or make up for deficiencies or excesses in private
spending. On this aspect, the Keynesians were right. They were just
over-optimistic about how much demand could be stimulated without running to
waste in inflation.
The most likely circumstance in which a UK policy change would be required
would be an excessive appreciation of sterling. This could come about even
without a break-up of the ERM from a fall in the D-Mark which left sterling
at a relatively high level.
Because of the UK's domestic inflation success there is room for modest
further appreciation of sterling, while preserving competitiveness and
reinforcing sound money credibility. But, at a sterling rate of somewhere
between DM2.60 and DM3, enough would be enough, as there could be a real
danger of overseas-led deflation. Exactly where this would come is a
judgment depending in part on where the pound is in relation to non-EC
currencies. A sterling index approaching anywhere near 90 (compared with 81
recently) would be a danger signal.
Faced with a massive sterling appreciation, UK interest rates would have to
be cut; and the number of Conservative MPs who believe in ignoring the
exchange rate would melt like Alpine snow in spring.
A very low interest rate, introduced for external reasons, might have to be
offset by a fiscal tightening. But taxes should not be deliberately raised
because of a hypothetical combination of circumstances. The best approach to
fiscal policy is still the long-term one, focusing on the control of public
spending.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Arts: Lament for a lost warrior - Opera in Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A youth barely out of his mother's arms rushes off to defend his people in
war, has his first taste of sexual love, heads into battle and is
slaughtered. Germany 1914? Britain in 1939? Bosnia today? It could be any -
but all are wrapped into one in Siegfried Matthus's Die Weise von Liebe und
Tod des Cornets Christoph Rilke (Cornet Christoph Rilke's Song of Love and
Death), which has just joined the repertory at Munich's Gartnerplatztheater
and will receive its British premiere in early October during Glyndebourne
Touring Opera's London season.
Matthus, born in 1934, had his talents honed by a long association with the
Komische Oper and is now enjoying belated international recognition as one
of Germany's most skilful, performable composers. Cornet Rilke is the sixth
and most successful of his eight operas. Commissioned for the reopening of
the Semper Opera House in Dresden in 1985, this 90-minute 'operatic vision'
is based on Rainer Maria Rilke's prose poem about his 17th century ancestor,
a young cavalry officer who died defending Europe against the heathen
Turkish hordes. A copy of the poem accompanied German soldiers heading for
the 1914-18 front, to inspire them with visions of a glorious death in
defence of the Fatherland. Rilke later tried to disclaim this
interpretation, saying his poem symbolised the way youth sheds its innocent
bloom in the explosive breakthrough to adulthood.
Without undermining the dream-like mood of romance, Matthus turns the poem
into an anti-war elegy, framing it with an a capella Dies Irae inspired by
the Allied destruction of Dresden. The poem itself offers little in the way
of conventional dialogue or narrative. What it does provide is a sequence of
thoughts, feelings and impressions, which Matthus clothes in music of
lyrical power and dramatic sensibility.
Horn, timpani and side-drum invoke the marching rhythms and regimental call
to arms, while a flute quartet, two harps and xylophone summon the
atmosphere of reverie, augmented by a mirage-like offstage chorus
(reminiscent of the hallucinatory echoes of 'Grimes' in the final act of
Britten's opera). The range of imagery Matthus draws from his 11
instrumentalists is wide - and even wider in the intricate choral parts,
requiring absolute security of pitch and balance. With his undogmatic brand
of serialism, subtly neo-romantic in effect, Matthus matches the emotional
power of the poem without dissolving into kitsch.
The Munich production, staged by Heinz Lukas-Kindermann in designs by Hans
Hoffer and Anette Schroder was well sung and acted, but sometimes missed the
mark in its choice of visual imagery. The performance began with a
projection of the autograph of Rilke's poem and the appearance of a small
boy with rocking horse and toy-banner; an unidentified man took a book out
of his pocket and began to read. The action unfolded on a stage-wide
staircase, populated by a row of outsize infantry boots in the opening
march, a troupe of debauched revellers in the bacchanale, and visionary
figures appearing from hidden doors during the Cornet's contemplative
soliloquies. A giant upright chair dominated the mysterious love scene,
which lacked dramatic focus. The finale, in which the Cornet awakes in a
blazing castle before riding to his death, was mimed in an abstract glow of
red light.
In the title role - a breeches part shared by two mezzos, one of whom gives
voice to the Cornet's inner thoughts - Annette Seiltgen and Sneshinka
Awramowa sang beautifully and movingly. The Countess, which Matthus divides
less convincingly between two sopranos, was elegantly portrayed by Evelyn
Holzschuh and Ulrike Steinsky. Above all, the chorus-master Hans-Joachim
Willrich and conductor Aleksander Kalajdzic deserve praise for their grasp
of Matthus's idiom.
So I enjoyed my visit to Munich's second opera house, where high standards
can be appreciated at a fraction of the cost of the starrily-cast but
sometimes barely-rehearsed festival performances across at the National
Theater. The Gartnerplatztheater's repertory is refreshingly offbeat (with
Weill's Street Scene also on this month's programme), and the building
itself is a jewel.

LAST ACTION HERO (15) John McTiernan
DENNIS (PG) Nick Castle
CHAIN OF DESIRE (18) Temistocles Lopez
JUST ANOTHER GIRL ON THE IRT (15) Leslie Harris
It is Mayday time in the media and movies. Major leakages are happening
between monitored make-believe and rebel reality. Designer dinosaurs turn
into ravening beasts; Conservative prime ministers slip into off-air
obscenity; and Arnold Schwarzenegger falls out of the cinema screen into the
real world of crime-ridden New York.
In today's pop science jargon they call it Chaos Theory. Last Action Hero,
starring the aforementioned Austro-American hulk, confirms what Hollywood's
Jurassic Park and British TV's 'Bastardgate' have just hinted. That in
today's hi-tech age the best-laid plans of mice and men, scientists and
politicians, are powerless to paper over the cracks between parallel worlds
and the slippages between design and denouement.
But - and when does show business fail to come up with a 'but'? - one can
always make a new art form from the debris of the old. Last Action Hero is
metafiction for the popcorn set. Spoof mixed with pastiche wrapped in
hommage, it tells us what happens when fictional Los Angeles cop hero Jack
Slater (Schwarzenegger) is joined inside his latest film by boy movie buff
Austin O'Brien, propelled into the screen by a magic ticket stub. (It once
belonged to Houdini).
Several adventures later, Slater repays the interdimensional visit by
crashing into the boy's native New York. So does the film-within-a-film's
villain Charles Dance, a white suit with a beard and braying RADA accent.
And so does the armoury of stunts and special effects assembled for this
Dollars 50m blockbuster directed by John (Die Hard) McTiernan.
If I tell the plot in detail, you will go mad. It involves the usual
foreground of fistfights, car chases, shoot-em-ups and hand-me-down tough
guy dialogue. What lends variety this time is the background. Cliches are
pixillated by context. In one scene the boy, watching Olivier's film of
Hamlet in school, daydreams a gun-toting parody version with
Slater-Schwarzenegger as the Dane. ('To be or not to be' quips the
fuse-lighting hero - 'not to be]' as Elsinore explodes around him). And
throughout the movie reality slides around in continuous flux, lubricated by
ludic in-jokes. The hi-tech police station is none other than Columbia
Pictures' own palatial lobby; the schoolmistress teaching Hamlet is none
other than Lady Olivier; and every other guest star carries his own
movie-referential hand luggage, from FBI agent F. Murray Abraham ('He killed
Mozart') to a roaring, grunting Anthony Quinn, capping all the Mafia capos
he ever played.
Foolish to make large claims for this amiable, untidy, overlong film. It
bears all the signs of a committee-born brainwave, with its cross-generation
casting and keep-em-awake piling of disparate incident. But Last Action Hero
also comes closer than any Hollywood film I have seen to a deconstructionist
primer on how to 'read' popular cinema. No sooner does the film perpetrate
twaddle than it comments on it and disarms it. As the cliches line up for
frisking - from the statutory hero's catch-phrase ('Beeg mistake]') to the
one-man arsenal of weaponry Schwarzenegger wears about him - we realise that
this is that rare and dangerous animal, a self-aware Hollywood action movie.
What ever next? Star Trek VII; The Intertextuality Zone? New Readings In
Rambo? Where Eagletons Dare? Hang on to your hats. Post-modernism may be
coming to the picture show.
No sign of it, though, in Dennis. The only segue between these two American
romps is Joan Plowright. New York schoolmarm here becomes Illinois housewife
 -both played with a majestic indifference to accent - and the teaming of
Lady Olivier's chubby aloofness with Walter Matthau's bloodhound-faced
dyspepsia is the chief inspiration in this maniac-child comedy scripted by
John (Home Alone) Hughes.
Based on the American newspaper strip-cartoon 'Dennis The Menace' (no
relation to the UK version), the movie jitters along from jape to jape as
10-year-old Dennis (Mason Gamble) sabotages false teeth, pours paint into
barbecues, catapults aspirins into grown-ups' sleeping mouths, wrecks
prize-winning gardens and makes life hell for his parents and next door
neighbours (Matthau/Plowright).
Master Gable is clearly cloned from Macaulay Culkin - Hollywood was into DNA
experiments long before Jurassic Park - and he goes through a near-identical
repertoire of fluttering eyes (mock innocence), gaping mouths ('Register
shock now, Mason') and whoops of delinquent triumph. The film climaxes in a
long, witless re-run of the boy-versus-burglar brutalities of Home Alone,
with Dennis subjecting footpad Christopher Lloyd to ordeal by bonfire, baked
beans and near-drowning. But before that there are moments of brighter,
sourer hilarity: especially when Matthau clumps into view, his jowly
asperity lighting up the screen like a sodium flare, his sinal twang sending
simple lines thudding to their comic target.
Chain Of Desire is La Ronde done on the cheap in New York, and as resistible
as that sounds. Venezuelan-born writer-director Temistocles Lopez
daisy-chains 12 tales of love and lust, their linking characters played by a
middle-magnitude cast including Malcolm McDowell (gay writer), Linda
Fiorentino (sultry chanteuse), Elias Koteas (stud repairman), Seymour Cassel
(action painter seeking extramarital action) and Assumpta Serna (action
painter's wife seeking ditto).
The press show audience was prone to incredulous mirth: as who would not be
when presented with the movie's dim dialogue, gauche camerawork and po-faced
procession of soft-porn encounters. The orgasmic transports of a shoe
fetishist; acts of sex atop a still-wet artist's canvas; simultaneous
masturbation by three window voyeurs . . . but no, enough. You might want to
see the film and make your own choice between goggling and giggling. The
wackiest touch, I thought, was the coffee-table book entitled
'Deconstruction' placed dangerously near one energetic daytime coupling. Was
this a comment on what might happen to the coffee table? Or is it part of
the movie industry's marching orders for a New Cerebralism we noted in Last
Action Hero?
Just Another Girl On The IRT is no less ill-focused but more strident: the
tale of an unmarried black girl from Brooklyn who gets pregnant, rails
against fate, screams at her boyfriend, refuses to have an abortion and ends
up developing that nastiest of pre-natal symptoms: talking to the camera.
(Deserted by everyone, she has only the audience to hector). Debut director
Leslie Harris is the first African-American woman to have a film distributed
in the UK. One applauds the breakthrough, but not the whingeing one-note
movie.
Elsewhere - and we warned you about the summer silly season - the choice is
between Liquid Sky (18, ICA) and a season of Ealing comedies at the
Barbican. The first is a 10-year-old cult sci-fi fantasy about aliens
cannibalising drug- and sex-crazed New Yorkers. The second is a time trip
back to the dear old days when sex had not been invented, New York was on
another planet and Britain was a comic cosmos unto itself. We have seen them
all before - Whisky Galore, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Ladykillers - but in
a week like this there are worse fates than seeing them all again.

ITV's imported National Geographic series showing macho feats of endurance,
Voyager, today tells the story of a journey by eight young men in an open
boat, a replica of a 12th century Celtic galley. The plan was to retrace a
journey made 700 years previously, from the west coast of Scotland to the
Faroes (7.30).
Is BS 5750 a means of turning British industry into a world beater, or a bit
of bureaucratic nonsense? In Business Matters Nick Clarke looks at the
effects of the international standard for quality introduced by the British
Standards Institute (8.00 BBC2).
There have been few original British programmes among the welter of repeats
this summer, and most have been mediocre, so you wonder whether inclusion in
the summer schedule is an admission of low quality. However, Thicker Than
Water, a mini-series on BBC1, has been adapted by
Trevor Preston and stars Theresa Russell and Jonathan Pryce, so it should be
worth a look.
BBC1 covers the declaration at Christchurch in By-election Special (12.15).

FT  29 JUL 93 / Arts: Melodic journey - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty years' worth of understated and carefully nurtured tenor playing
produced the Grammy-winning Joe Henderson in full bloom at London's Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Monday. A diffident personality, usually wreathed in
cigarette smoke, Henderson's restraint and lack of bluster has kept him out
of the headlines but in the best musical company since his early years with
Kenny Dorham and Horace Silver. A new label deal and a series of
well-conceived discs which diffuse the polished melodies of Billy Strayhorn
and mellow the cool loneliness of Miles Davis brought him blinking into the
spotlight last year.
At a time when young saxophonists are expected to make their mark through
sonic attack, Henderson leaves a deep and lasting impression through his
sonorous, considered interpretation. Backed by the talkative upright bass of
Dave Holland and the bright, skittish drumming of Al Foster, the Henderson
tenor ripens before your ears.
Proceeding from Strayhorn's 'Isfahan' a melodic picture sensitively built
up, 'Take The 'A' Train' introduced gentle harmonic embellishment and a
choppy 'Lush Life' even produced the odd skirl from the reed. Typically,
Henderson's development of these seasoned works took on the manner of a
journey to an unknown destination with pauses on the way to savour the
melody. The conclusion of each number is reached unwittingly but naturally.
Diversions created by thrumming, fret-rattling solos from Holland or
good-humoured polyrhthyms from Foster, are carefully measured - Henderson's
own excursions rationed to not overwhelm the ear.
The saxophone trio must be one of the most testing formats for the concert
hall, for all concerned. It is a tribute to the Joe Henderson trio's
musicianship that their tunes hang in the air, without hiatus, to be
savoured in all their richness, with neither introduction nor explanation
needed. The group's fine volume balance, Henderson's magisterial lead, deep
sensitivity to the music, and each other's involvement in it, now set the
standard for small groups of any instrumentation.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Arts: Warmth in the frozen north - Kuhmo Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West of the Russian border and just below the Arctic Circle, the Finnish
town of Kuhmo boasts 13,000 souls and more than 600 lakes. In the ordinary
English sense of 'town', only slightly more than half the population lives
there, with the rest scattered amid 5500 square kilometres of Kainuu
wilderness. Kuhmo 'town' was badly hit in the last war; nothing of
distinction remains to it but its fine, spacious wooden church from the last
century - and the beautiful Northern lakescape.
For no fathomable reason, the cellist Seppo Kimanen decided to found a
'Kuhmo Chamber Music' festival there in 1970. (The locals were bemused; many
of them still are.) It has become one of the world's happiest music
festivals, as this year the 24th festival confirmed again, in spite of
carnivorous mosquitoes. Outside of Scandinavia not many people know that,
except for musicians; and it would be self-defeating if many more did. There
is a magic formula, as it happens, though it is flexible enough to be
re-interpreted every year, and may anyhow be unfeasible anywhere but in
Kuhmo. It goes something like this:
From many countries, invite the keenest, most musicianly chamber-players
available, including full-time ensembles such as the Lindsay Quartet (Kuhmo
regulars) but also established soloists whose careers leave too little space
for chamber music except in their holidays. For derisory fees but superior
rewards, let them deliver their best party-pieces, individually and
plurally, but insist also that they work with newly-met colleagues on fresh
performances of music old and new. Further, some will be teaching and/or
running master-classes for the 'Music Camp' of student talent from around
the world.
Shape all that into a programme with some coherent themes: this July, we had
all Mozart's and Boccherini's quintets, Haydn piano trios, a survey of
recent Icelandic music, Austro-German and French classics, old and new music
from Japan (Kimanen's wife is Yoshiko Arai, leader of his Sibelius Quartet).
Add some premieres, some recherche rediscoveries and some pieces for odd
ensembles. Make it all so intensive, with music practically round the clock,
that the idyllic simplicity of the place will be the perfect restorative.
The marathon Saturday night concerts - 'night' is the wrong word - are still
going on while sunset merges into sunrise. Nobody dresses up, neither
artists nor the audience.
It is a rare, illuminating pleasure to hear first-class musicians working
out ideas and responding to each other, so to speak, on-the-hoof. If
something does not work, no harm done, no reputation endangered;
contrariwise these performances can strike brighter sparks, again and again,
than stuff polished for the international circuit. It is a boon to have such
artists to introduce the unfamiliar pieces, too, which may never have
enjoyed playing of this calibre.
This year, for example, the flautist Philippa Davies, the clarinettist
Michael Collins and the cellist Robert Cohen came from Britain, Stephen
Burns brought his trumpet from America, and the pianists Christian Ivaldi
and Philippe Cassard were on hand to ensure strict faithfulness to French
style (the Franco-British collaborations in Poulenc were splendid). More
about all this in the Weekend FT, especially about Kuhmo's wonderful new
concert hall.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Pulling together on
the high seas - In the run-up to Cowes Keith Wheatley says corporate
yachting has chartered a new course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thick black clouds were building to the west and a squall filled Creightons'
giant spinnaker to bursting point. The 80ft maxi-yacht thundered up the
Solent in need of a sail change. The mixed crew of Touche Ross staff and
clients were about to get stuck in.
When the spinnaker was released, thousands of square feet of billowing nylon
came down in a rush. Willing arms flailed and strained to gather it aboard
before it became the Solent's most brightly coloured fishing net.
'I've never been to any client event where people are so relaxed so
quickly,' comments George Owen, marketing director for the Praxis software
arm of Touche Ross. 'You're wearing casual clothes, winding winches
together. There isn't any time for formality.'
Until the past three or four years, corporate use of yachts almost certainly
meant champagne, lobster and a 'jolly' for the board and its valued
customers. The recession killed that. In some respects it looked as if the
recreational boating market might also be in a terminal condition. Every
south coast marina had more boats laid-up in the car park than afloat on
their moorings.
Yet what has emerged is a strong and growing market of company-related
competitive sailing, both for corporate entertainment and in-house training
purposes.
Companies that are used to the costs of Wimbledon or Ascot find it
increasingly appealing and effective to be able to put 20 people aboard a
boat such as Creightons for less than Pounds 2,000. The result is that
clients invited on such outings are more likely to be handed a set of
oilskins than the customary umbrella and pen.
'We expected our UK fleet usage to be leisure-based, as the boats are in the
Mediterranean,' says Vanessa Lowe, marketing manager for Sunsail. 'In fact,
we have a huge demand to charter them as a fleet for corporate racing and
training.' From a marina base at Port Solent near Portsmouth, Sunsail runs a
large operation that involves handling the 35ft Beneteau club/racers as if
they were hire cars.
Probably the most common pattern is for an industry or sector to set up a
challenge and then the yachts are rented by individual companies who put
their team aboard. Brewers, accountants and the advertising industry follow
this method.
Sunsail organises all the courses and race starts and finishes - even to the
extent of warning competitors firmly that the protest committee is away on a
golfing holiday. The Industry Sailing Challenge, sponsored by T&amp;N, the UK
engineering company, has seen 212 companies and 3,000 competitors in its
seven-year history.
This year's finalists included Richard Ellis, Ford, SG Warburg and Touche
Ross.
'For most sailors once around the Isle of Wight is more than enough. Twice
around, which means sailing through the night, is very testing,' says Clive
Jacobs, the former broadcaster, whose company Ocean Racing Agency owns and
manages the event.
'It requires not just the determination to succeed but stamina to go with
it. I think that's why so many firms who compete use the event for
leadership, problem solving and decision-making under stress, and - above
all - the development of team working.'
'We wanted to be involved in something like this because it's sporting, not
conspicuous consumption by a few senior people,' says Owen. 'The fact that
most of us don't know anything about sailing is a plus. Learning how to
learn together is very important.'
Trainers point out that one of the advantages of yachting is that little can
be achieved by individuals, the tasks are too large and too heavy, and that
the group is in a self-contained universe with no outside distractions and a
simple common goal.
'The team-work side of sailing on a boat this big and complex takes them by
surprise,' says Tony Allen, a solicitor and one of the co-owners of
Creightons.
'They arrive as strangers and within an hour or so they're touching hands on
winches and shoulder to shoulder on halyards. That kind of thing doesn't
happen in daily office life.
'We never get blase about seeing it happen. I spend half my week in an
office and people just don't intermingle that easily, although these kinds
of physical challenges show that they want to.'

FT  29 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): When the jokes start
to wear thin - Humour can benefit a campaign but must not make the product
seem superfluous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN-LOUIS BARSOUX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Volkswagen introduced the Rabbit (known as the Golf in the UK) to the
US market it used a simple commercial. It showed two rabbits looking
straight at the camera. A voice-over stated: 'In 1956 there were only two
VWs in America.' The ad lasted 10 seconds, but it made its case with economy
and wit.
There are good reasons for using humour in advertising. Both have
compression forced on them: humour for effect, and commercials because air
time costs money.
Humour also helps commercial persuasion through its capacity to engage.
Humour can soften the sales blow, relaxing viewers and making them more
attentive. A good example was the recent 'Creature Comforts' campaign in
which an animated panda, cat, tortoise and parrot took turns to vaunt the
merits of electricity. The soundtrack amounted to little more than a
straight product endorsement - something barely worthy of attention. But
coming from comic Plasticine figures, the audience lapped it up.
Such commercials show the value of using humour, not least as a defence
against the devastating remote control which allows 'trigger-happy' viewers
to wipe out thousands of pounds of advertising at the flick of a switch.
The problem is that advertisers seem to have carried the joke too far. The
evidence abounds. It starts with the over-representation of comic
celebrities as brand mascots - from Robbie Coltrane (Persil washing up
liquid) to Dudley Moore (Tesco) - not to mention the virtual colonisation by
comedians of the financial services sector.
The rationale behind this is that comedians are memorable and
consumer-friendly. But their comic persona can overshadow the brand and any
empathy felt towards them is no guarantee of action.
It may be that British agencies are looking too hard for a joke on which to
hang their selling proposition. One manifestation is the increasing number
of spoof ads. For instance, the current Carling Black Label offering
('Spider in the dunny') looks very much like a Castlemaine XXXX commercial.
This could be a measure of the confidence advertisers have in the capacity
of viewers to distinguish between joke-kitsch and the real thing. But such
ads have a fin de siecle feel to them. Though entertaining, they are
self-indulgent. One-upmanship has edged out any strong product message. They
imply that new creativity is impossible, that there can only be exhuming and
recycling of the old.
Advances in technology have also served as excuses for dragging humour into
commercials. For example, a recent series of Tennent's Pilsner spots relied
for their comic impact on a mixture of actions running forwards and
backwards, including people jumping out of the sea. The impression it left
was one of a technique looking for a script.
Another culprit was the much-praised, but now defunct, Holsten campaign. As
former JWT chairman, Jeremy Bullmore, pointed out: 'You could take Holsten
out and you'd still get a quite agreeable technique of interfacing a modern
comedian with old movie footage - which is admirable and difficult and
clever - but more or less any product could have replaced it.'
Or again, take the Mercury Communications ads starring Harry Enfield in
something resembling an Ealing comedy. The suitability of a black-and-white
pastiche for what is such a forward-looking IT company has to be questioned.
Another instance of the joke getting the better of the product message? The
humour in such commercials does not emerge from the product but is
arbitrarily applied to it. It therefore fails to reveal anything of
interest, importance or value about the product. Such ads may not bore, but
neither are they likely to set the cash tills ringing.
In replacing the hard sell with a more entertaining approach, often the
product or service appears superfluous.
As Bullmore sees it: 'Humour shouldn't be bolt-on, it should be integral.
And once you've said that, you can get rid of about three-quarters of
humorous advertising.'
Winston Fletcher, chairman of Bozell Europe, the advertising agency,
reiterates the point: 'Humour should support an idea, not be a substitute
for one. It should make you think differently about what's being offered.'
A good example is the current Direct Line motor insurance campaign, which
sets the product in the role of hero. In it, a little red telephone comes
hurtling to the rescue of people who need insurance. The phone not only
symbolises the persona of the company, but encourages telephone inquiries.
The campaign has been so successful that Direct Line has almost abandoned
press advertising altogether.
The golden rule for comedy in commercials is that the humour should arise
from the selling point. Unless the humour is woven into the product message,
the danger is the jokes will merely serve as a distraction. It should be
impossible to remember the 'joke' without remembering the attendant message.
Opting for a humorous style of advertising is fine provided it is not done
at the expense of the selling principles on which advertising is founded.
Advertising can be light hearted but it must not stop there. The ad has to
make the viewer think differently about a product or service. Advertising
must always be a means to an end.
Therefore, the basic question for companies to ask themselves when presented
with a humorous rough cut is: 'Would the ad still have shape if the product
were removed?' Before accepting the humorous gloss agencies are wont to
foist on them, companies must think carefully - otherwise they may find that
the joke is on them.

FT  29 JUL 93 / People: Board shuffle at Evered Bardon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Murray, board member and managing director of the UK division of
Evered Bardon, the aggregates group, has resigned after a management
reshuffle in which three managing directors previously reporting to him now
report directly to group chief executive Peter Tom.
'This is part of the tidying up process (after the merger of Evered and
Bardon in 1991),' says finance director William McGrath. 'We are not that
big or complicated a company that we needed that extra layer.'
Hence George Plant at Bardon Roadstone, John Hume at John Fyfe and Donald
McKerraker at Tractor Shovels will report to Tom.
Murray, who is 52, came from the Evered side - while Tom was chairman and
chief executive of Bardon. Murray had run Tractor Shovels, and then added
John Fyfe when the latter was acquired by Evered. After the merger, he took
on responsibility for Bardon Roadstone, the core business of Bardon.
'He is leaving amicably,' says McGrath, who adds that Murray was on a
three-year contract but is 'getting his contractual entitlements, not vast
sums of money at all'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the latest of many management changes at fund managers HENDERSON
ADMINISTRATION, John Hughes, the board member responsible for
administration, has resigned. A spokesman on behalf of the company said that
his job had changed, and been enlarged, since the recent acquisition of
Touche Remnant. 'There were lengthy discussions about his role and about job
satisfaction. But it didn't work out, unfortunately for him,' the spokesman
said.
Hughes, 48, had been on the board since 1988 and had joined the company a
year earlier. Between 1984 and 1987 he had been systems director at BZW, and
for the previous decade he had worked in the marketing department of Rank
Xerox.
Tony Solway, director of systems, is acting head of administration while the
board decides what will happen to the post.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Eric Parker, the former chief executive of Trafalgar House, is renewing
his longstanding ties with the construction industry by taking on the
chairmanship of Graham Consulting, a privately-owned firm of consulting
engineers.
Sir Eric, 60, who left Trafalgar House last month following a boardroom
reshuffle, has spent most of his working life in the construction industry.
He joined Trafalgar House in 1965 and, along with founder Sir Nigel
Broackes, transformed the company from a stock market minnow into a major
conglomerate with Pounds 4bn of sales.
By contrast Graham Consulting, set up by Frank Graham in 1967, is a
relatively small operation even by the standards of the consulting
engineering business. It employs 650 staff and in the year to end March made
operating profits of Pounds 718,000 on revenues of Pounds 22m.
However, the company has carved out a niche for itself as the leading
consulting engineers specialising in maintaining Britain's motorways.
Traditionally, the job has been done by local government highway departments
but starting in 1986 the Department of Transport started to privatise the
business and Graham Consulting now oversees the maintenance of several large
highway networks in West Yorkshire and London.
Sir Eric becomes non-exec-utive chairman on September 1 and replaces the
late Sir Roy Watts.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Technology: On the line to a wider service - The telephone
has joined forces with the computer to become a potent marketing tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sexy chat lines and quiz games have meant fast bucks for the telephone
service companies and a bad reputation for premium-rate telephone calls.
But increasingly, audiotex, which combines computer processing power with
traditional telephone services, is being used as a marketing tool to improve
customer service and sell more products, be it bottles of beer or airline
tickets.
UK furniture retailer Maples, for example, decided to use a special
telephone service to back up its national press advertising. When the
adverts appeared, the company needed one number which potential customers
could call to inquire about the colour and fabric of sofas or chairs.
'Rather than try to train third-party people about our business we decided
to use the trained staff out there in our stores who already knew our
business,' explains Mark Collier, marketing operations manager for Maples.
'So the object of the exercise was to find a way of putting our customers
directly in contact with their local store.'
The answer was to advertise a single telephone number and then automatically
divert callers to their nearest Maples shop. This was achieved by matching
the national map of post codes with a similar map of telephone numbers -
when the customer calls, a computer recognises his or her number and then
ascertains the nearest store.
When the stores are closed, a recorded announcement gives the location of
the nearest store and invites customers to call back the following day.
The 21 Maples stores receive between 300 and 400 calls a month as a direct
result of the service. But the success of the venture is difficult to
determine, other than through anecdotal evidence, says Collier. 'In
conversations with our store managers quite a few have commented that people
have called about the adverts and then come into the stores and bought
something. What we do know is that we sell a lot more of the suites that we
advertise than of those that we don't'
In the US, audiotex services are a way of life - freephone calls are a
Dollars 75bn (Pounds 50bn) market and 25 per cent of all long-distance
traffic there carries freephone calls. In the UK, worries about adult, or
'pink' services and complaints from angry parents about their teenage
offspring clocking up large telephone bills have tended to hamper the
market. As a result business services are only just begining to establish
themselves.
These days, 25 per cent of all television adverts in the UK carry an 0800
number. 'In the UK, we're heading towards more serious business services,'
says Jacqui Howett, business development director of Legion, the
London-based voice processing company which specialises in setting up
telephone services for clients such as Maples. 'More and more services are
business to business.'
The UK is not the only European country where this is happening. According
to a recent Eurodata report on premium-rate services, the European market
for such services will grow from Dollars 1bn in 1992 to more than Dollars
2bn in 1995.
Maples' decision to operate a business audiotex line was taken because it
was 'very cheap and easy to operate,' says Collier. 'It is an easy system to
manipulate and manage if we open a new store.'
Maples uses an 0345 number, so callers pay as if for a local call and Maples
pays the rest of the charges - less than Pounds 5,000 a year in total. The
alternatives would have been to use an 0800 or 0500 number, where the call
would have been free to the caller, or a premium rate number, prefixed with
codes such as 0891 and 0839 where the caller pays a premium rate of 36p or
48p a minute. 'When we started off, we didn't know how many calls would be
made or how much it would cost, so we thought the fairest thing was to go
for a half-way house,' explains Collier. 'We didn't want to make money, that
didn't sit very comfortably.'
Other companies are not so reticent. Many companies now run competitions
which involve telephoning at the premium rate to give the correct answers.
'It can bring a number of benefits to the brand,' says Matthen Hooper,
managing director of marketing communications company Interfocus. 'It can
extend the budget and can be re-invested in the campaign. Or it sometimes
gives the funds for a mail shot of information.'
Charities are also big users of premium-rate lines. The choice depends on
the objective, says Howett.
'If the objective is to generate revenue to help cover the costs of the
promotion, then premium-rate calls are the answer. If you want to create a
customer database, then an 0800 number is best. If you don't want to
overcharge but you want to eliminate every Tom, Dick and Harry that calls on
a freephone line, then an 0345 is the answer.'
For many companies, automated answering is seen as a way of reducing costs.
'Faced with the ever rising cost of employing live telephone agents,
telemarketing operations are increasingly looking to use automated
telemarketing to supplement their live agent operations,' Howett says. 'The
beauty of automated systems is that you only pay for the calls you receive,
not for an operator sitting there all day.'
Others are combining traditional human answering services with
computer-aided telephony for out-of-hours or overflow calls.
Automated answering is most suitable for mundane repetitive inquiries,
Howett points out. 'We can weed out the people who want the basic
information and then pass the more complicated inquiries on to the company's
operators.'
Many companies run a short-term promotion campaign, while others keep the
numbers open on a long-term basis. The choice of service depends on the
target audience, says Howett. 'You don't need a sophisticated service if
your target market can't handle it.' That said, many organisations use
surprisingly complicated services.
Legion, for example, frequently runs competitions for its customers where
the computer can tell whether the answers given by the competitor are
correct or incorrect, either by asking them to key in numbers on the
telephone keypad, or by using voice recognition technology. (The latest
systems can recognise a string of common words including numbers from one to
10.) If correct, the caller is then asked to leave his or her name and
address.
This is recorded and the service provider can then pick the winners at
random or pass the tape of all successful respondents back to the client to
select the winner.
Other organisations have learnt to exploit very skilfully the value of the
lines. The Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Trust, for example, runs two
professionally scripted lines, recorded by UK celebrities Joanna Lumley and
Gary Lineker. They invite the caller to do three things: donate money; leave
their name and address as potential bone marrow donors; and listen to
information on the work of the trust.
Other organisations are making businesses out of 'fax on demand' services
where, by tapping in a premium number on a fax machine, textual information
is automatically sent out to that fax number. Telecom Express, for example,
runs a service for the Evening Standard sending out the financial pages to
those who request it.
Foreign newspapers could be sent to readers in the UK this way, as already
happens in the US, says George Porchester, one of the founding shareholders
of Telecom Express. Porchester believes one of the developments in the near
future will be the combination of premium voice and fax services, so that if
a caller wanted further information after listening to a live operator or
recorded message, details could be sent automatically by fax.
Eventually, says Hooper, 'people will begin to look at telephone lines as
they do a traditional coupon on an ad. They will begin to see they can get
information immediately and at half the cost.'

FT  29 JUL 93 / Technology: The little engine that could - A machine that
offers power from less fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An engine that provides high power on low fuel consumption is the object of
a never-ending quest for the car industry.
Mazda, the Hiroshima-based car maker, claims to have made great strides in
that pursuit with an engine that raises fuel efficiency by 10 to 15 per
cent, compared with conventional engines without losing power.
The new engine is known as the Miller-cycle engine, after Ralph Miller, an
American engineer who came up with the theory in 1947.
According to Mazda, its Miller-cycle engine
will combine the fuel efficiency of a 2,000cc engine with the power of a
3,000cc engine.
The improvement means that each car using a Miller-cycle engine will emit
600kg less carbon dioxide in a year, which, in effect, is equivalent to
planting 100 trees, according to Kouichi Hatamura, manager of the Powertrain
Engineering Promotion Group at Mazda.
Given the growing concern with environmental protection, 'the key to future
competitiveness lies in how much an engine reduces the amount of CO it
emits,' Hatamura believes.
Mazda's faith in the importance of creating an environmentally friendly
engine kept the company's development team working long after others had
given up on putting it to practical use in cars.
In the 1980s, no less than General Motors of the US, and Nissan of Japan,
among others, put a lot of work into developing the Miller-cycle engine.
The problem facing car makers is that increasing the power of a car usually
leads to lower fuel efficiency. Specifically, the power of a car to turn its
wheels, known as torque, increases in proportion to the amount of air and
fuel that is injected into the engine.
The energy that creates torque results from the movement of the piston in
the engine's cylinders that compresses the air and fuel mixture in an upward
stroke. The pressure on that air-fuel mixture causes combustion. Energy is
released in the piston's next movement known as the expansion stroke. The
larger the expansion stroke, the greater the engine's torque.
One way to increase torque is to push more air and fuel into the same amount
of space. The problem is that although it allows high fuel efficiency, it
tends to raise the temperature of the engine and create abnormal combustion,
known as knocking.
Mazda'a Miller-cycle engine overcomes that problem by keeping the intake
valves through which the air and fuel mixture enters the cylinder open for
part of the compression time. This prevents the temperature from rising too
much and thereby avoids knocking.
The intake valve is left open until the piston rises one-fifth from the
bottom and some of the air-fuel mixture flows out of the cylinder at this
time. The valve is then closed for a shortened compression stroke.
However, the shorter compression stroke means that the pressure is reduced.
And when this happens, expansion is reduced as well.
So Mazda had to find a way of keeping the pressure high so as not to reduce
the amount of expansion, which would in turn have reduced the torque.
What it needed was a new type of compressor to do the job.
Working with Ishikawajima- Harima Heavy Industries, the company adapted the
Lysholm compressor - found in some ships and in industrial use - for use in
cars.
With the Lysholm compressor, twice the pressure of conventional compressors
can be applied to the air-fuel mixture when it is pushed into the cylinder.
Since the mixture is already compressed, even with a reduced compression
stroke by the piston, expansion is not reduced.
The compressed air-fuel mixture also contributes to the fuel efficiency of
the engine.
Mazda plans to introduce its new engine in some of its higher-end cars in
about a year. It will be the first time in more than 40 years for the
Miller-cycle engine to be brought to practical use in cars.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: US profession faces up to self-policing
role - A reform package which addresses the gap between users' expectations
and reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK CARR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US accounting profession has leapt from inaction into a frenzy of reform
activity as it faces one of the most challenging periods in its history.
With great fanfare the 310,000-member American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) last month unveiled a reform package designed to beef up
its self-policing mechanism and take on additional reporting
responsibilities.
Several weeks earlier, it recommended that the US Congress enact legislation
to strengthen the reporting requirements for pension funds.
Describing these reforms, Mr John Hunnicutt, vice president of legislative
affairs for the AICPA, told a group in Alabama that the profession's
leadership was aware of the beating accountants took as the result of the
savings and loans scandals. Damage control was too little and too late. This
time, he said, the profession wanted to 'get ahead of the curve'.
These and other recent moves by US accountants are designed to improve the
profession's sagging image as Congress holds hearings on possible reform of
federal securities laws. Citing estimates that accounting firms face 4,000
lawsuits seeking Dollars 20bn, (Pounds 13bn) the profession claims it cannot
survive without legal relief from 'abusive' securities suits.
High profile financial failures and record settlements between accounting
firms and litigators not only cut into partners' pockets. They have also
chipped away at the profession's once pristine image among the public,
politicians and potential recruits.
'Given the unprecedented level of financial fraud witnessed over the past
decade, the investing public and this sub-committee have a legitimate right
to ask why so many financial institutions failed shortly after receiving an
unqualified opinion,' Mr William McLucas, director of the enforcement
division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), told Congress
recently.
As the most recent reforms indicate, the profession realises that before
there can be any relief from lawsuits, it must address the gap between
users' expectations of auditors and the actual service delivered. While some
can only be enacted through legislation, others could be implemented through
the profession's system of self-governance and private-sector standard
setting.
Broadly speaking the AICPA aims are three-fold:
Revamp the self-policing system. The AICPA would replace its current
disciplinary system, which moves at glacial speed because it must await the
outcome of litigation, with a mechanism to investigate swiftly and punish
accountants guilty of misconduct or substandard work. Another proposed
initiative would bar public companies from hiring the partner in charge of
their audit for one year. Both require legislation.
Revitalise financial reporting practices. The current process is outdated
and no longer meets the needs of users. 'In many ways we're selling a 1930s
product to a 1990s audience,' says Mr Jake Netterville, AICPA chairman. As
part of its effort, the institute calls for greater disclosure of risks and
uncertainties and a complete review of financial reporting practices.
Achieve near-perfect fraud detection. Current auditing standards require
procedures designed to detect material fraud. But in introducing the reform
initiatives, Mr Netterville startled many by declaring: 'Fraud detection is
our job. The public expects auditors to uncover financial manipulation. Our
goal is 100 per cent detection.' The reform package advocates tougher new
guidelines to assess the possibility of management fraud.
In addition to these intiatives, the profession has dropped its
long-standing opposition to fraud reporting legislation which demands that
auditors report suspected wrongdoing to the authorities. It calls for new
laws forcing all participants in the reporting system to notify auditors of
financial shenanigans. It also advocates management reporting - verified by
auditors - on the effectiveness of internal controls.
The reform package suggests that the institute leadership accepts change is
necessary. But a closer look reveals that many of the proposals are existing
projects that have been dusted off in preparation for the Congressional
hearings on litigation reform.
For example, a special AICPA committee has been studying user needs and the
financial reporting process for more than two years, and should release its
report next spring. The institute's Accounting Standards Executive Committee
has already issued an exposure draft of a rule that would require auditors
to report on risks and uncertainties.
The freshest components of the recent package aim to polish the tarnished
image of the auditor. But critics point out that these proposals, such as
investigations of alleged audit failure and bans on hiring audit partners,
lack detail and a concrete timetable for implementation.
'We are heartened by their statements but we would expect that there would
be more action on the public interest agenda before we move to their private
interest agenda,' said an aide to Representative Ron Wyden, a Congressman
from Oregon and longtime critic of the profession.
Mr Walter Schuetze, the Security and Exchange Commission's chief accountant,
says: 'The single most significant and encouraging thing about these
initiatives is that the profession is finally admitting its responsibility
to report fraud.'
Because of its potential to increase liability exposure, this promise is
also the most dangerous aspect of the new proposals. The profession's
guidelines remain vague. Equally, auditors alone cannot compel other
participants in the reporting process - like bank examiners and lawyers - to
blow the whistle on suspected fraud.
Most experts agree that detecting all fraud is unrealistic and would be too
costly to implement. No audit can identify sophisticated collusion among top
management or all non-material fraud. The high risk of failure in this area
has the potential to sabotage the profession's efforts in others.
Additionally, internal control reporting has been advocated and rejected
several times over the past decade. Although the concept was recently
incorporated into new banking rules governing the largest financial
institutions, some experts question whether the reviews will be effective
against fraud.
Critics such as many companies argue that the substantial costs far outweigh
the benefits. In the case of banks, the process has been estimated to add 5
to 20 per cent to the price of an audit.
The reforms may do little to sway Congress as it considers legal reform. But
improving the usefulness of financial reporting and shoring up the public's
perception of auditor objectivity and independence may prove just as
important to the survival of the profession.
They also represent a public commitment by the AICPA. Many of the reform
efforts require action by Congress, the SEC or other regulatory bodies,
raising the danger that accountants will be perceived as dragging their feet
through no fault of their own.
The next few months will be a critical time for accountants in the US. With
or without tort reform, it is essential that accountants take charge of
their destiny by aggressively implementing those reforms on which they have
the power to act. The credibility of the profession is on the line.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Getting on the aid map is only half the battle: Meeting
government criteria for regional financial assistance can be a tricky but
rewarding business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SKIRMISH between parts of Britain vying for assisted-area status is
over. Now the fight for the grants it unlocks can begin.
From this weekend the government's new assisted areas map, announced last
Friday, comes into effect, entitling companies in parts of London and on the
east and south coasts of England for the first time to regional financial
assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry.
Many company directors in the new assisted areas are aware there could be
something in this for them - the DTI received nearly 2,000 submissions
pleading to be on the new map, which covers 34 per cent of Britain's working
population.
But many newly assisted areas, and companies within them, face a steep
learning curve if they are to obtain full benefit from a grants regime which
has no automatic entitlements and no fixed grant rate.
The message to new contenders from successful applicants in north-east
England - parts of which have been assisted since regional aid began in the
1930s - is encouraging.
'It was a good return on the effort,' said Mr Neil Heppell, finance director
of Tyneside-based Freudenberg Technical Products, which was offered Pounds
900,000 in regional selective assistance last year towards a Pounds 5m
project.
Mr Peter Cowin, co-founder of Seabait, a Northumberland fishing-bait
producer, said: 'The DTI were very helpful and processed things very
quickly.' He has made two succesful applications for regional assistance
grants totalling Pounds 45,000.
Inevitably, not all applicants succeed. In 1991-92, offers of assistance
totalled Pounds 210.5m, against applications for Pounds 368.5m. The DTI
expects to offer about the same amount of regional assistance grants this
year.
Small companies in assisted areas can also apply for regional enterprise
grants of up to Pounds 15,000 for investment projects, or up to Pounds
25,000 for innovation projects. These grants totalled Pounds 13.7m in
1991-92.
To maximise the chances of getting assistance, it is important to understand
not just the DTI's criteria but the thinking behind them.
On average, awards in development areas run at between 15 per cent and 20
per cent of the fixed capital cost of a project; in intermediate areas, the
average is 10 per cent. The main criteria are:
The project must show viability.
It must create or safeguard jobs.
It must have a regional or national benefit.
It must need the grant.
Assistance must be the minimum required to enable the project to go ahead
and be funding of last resort.
Arguing a project's case may be complex; applicants must decide whether to
go it alone, enlist the help of accountants or auditors, seek advice from
enterprise agencies and similar bodies or turn to one of the teams of
consultants specialising in UK and European grants and loans applications.
Grants are good business for consultants - within days of the annoucement of
the new map, Eurofi, which says it is Europe's largest independent grants
consultancy, had sent offers of help in applying for assistance to targeted
companies throughout Britain's newly assisted areas.
Mindful that many companies resent paying for no certain result, many
consultants work largely on a success fee basis, geared to the grant
obtained. 'No duck, no dinner,' said Mr Vince Taylor, one of the accountants
in Coopers &amp; Lybrand's 15-strong specialist grants team, which helped 10 of
the newly assisted areas to lobby successfully for their place on the map.
Officially the DTI has no view on the use of consultants by applicants.
Privately, some officials find reputable, experienced consultants helpful
while others have mixed feelings, especially if the consultants' fee is
linked to the size of grant obtained.
Mr Jim Driscoll, responsible for grants and inward investment at Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, warns against any premature actions, such as taking an option on
land, which suggests firm commitment to a project.
Mr Driscoll says applicants often find it difficult to understand their
project must be commercially viable, yet need grant aid to proceed. 'Need
means the need to secure the project in that location,' he said.
If all this sounds daunting, potential applicants can take heart from Mr
Cowin. Applications for assistance are easy, he says, compared with the
Euro-grants maze. 'That's a nightmare.'

FT  29 JUL 93 / Matisse boosts Christies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES AT Christies Inter-national, the fine-art auctioneer, rose 16 per cent
to Pounds 683m in the 1992-93 season which ends this month. But in dollar
terms - major works of art are valued in US dollars - the gain on the year
was only 1 per cent, to Dollars 1.05bn.
Mr David Tyler, finance director, said yesterday: 'We feel generally
encouraged. There has been a slow consolidation, and the mood has improved
in the last six months.' However, the art market still has a long way to go
to approach the heights of 1989-90.
Nine works of art fetched prices above Dollars 5m, compared with six in the
1991-92 season. Six were Impressionist or post-Impressionist pictures. The
sums included Dollars 14.5m for a Matisse and Dollars 12.1m and Dollars 9.6m
for Monet paintings. Two others which fetched more than Dollars 5m were Old
Masters.
The most encouraging factor was the return of some major buyers for
post-1870 pictures, which were at the centre of the rise in the art market
in the late 1980s.
The auctioneer's sales in New York were up 28 per cent - 12 per cent in
dollar terms - compared with a sterling rise of 10 per cent in the UK.

<TEXT>
Ramsgate in Kent, on the Isle of Thanet - which includes the other seaside
towns of Margate and Broadstairs - is the only area in the south-east to
gain full development rather than intermediate area status, which puts it on
a par with areas such as Glasgow, Liverpool, Barnsley and Hartlepool. Thanet
has not received aid in the past and there is a lack of familiarity with the
procedures involved. Thanet District Council is telling companies which want
advice on how to get aid to contact either the East Kent Initiative in
Dover, which made the bid for assisted status on behalf of the area, or the
DTI directly. Hotels and tourist services, on which Thanet's economy has
traditionally depended, are eligible for aid.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Pesticide levels in drinking water rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE PESTICIDES and chemical residues were found in drinking water last year
than in 1991, the second consecutive year to show an increase, the Drinking
Water Inspectorate said yesterday.
Overall water quality remained the same - 98.7 per cent of the 3.75m tests
complied with the national standards, the inspectorate said in its third
annual report. Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, said: 'There is no evidence
that where the standards were not met the health of consumers was
endangered.'
Last year 3 per cent of water supply zones failed to meet pesticide
standards, compared with 2.8 per cent in 1991 and 2.1 per cent in 1990.
Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, said the rise
in pesticide detection was partly because sampling had increased.

<TEXT>
NEW RULES requiring councils to keep registers of fixed assets will
revolutionise local-authority accounting and are expected to improve
financial management.
A new statement of recommended practice, approved last week by the
Accounting Standards Board, means that councils will have to show the value
of property - such as schools and equipment - in their balance sheets at
current cost and recognise the cost of using such assets.
'As local authorities become more like commercial organisations they have
got to manage their assets properly,' said Mr Martin Evans, head of the
technical division at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, which describes the changes as the most radical in
local-authority accounting for 100 years. 'Many authorities are asset-rich
but do not know the value of the assets they hold,' he said.
Most councils are obliged to implement the changes by the 1994-95 financial
year.
The move to capital accounting will also help comparisons between public and
private-sector services in the move towards compulsory competitive tendering
by local authorities.
Indications are that few will be enthusiastic about the changes. Mr Martin
Pilgrim, of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities,
said many councils were concerned about the cost of the exercise. 'Although
it is inevitable that our present practices have to change, many authorities
will not see this as positive or helpful.'
Mr Evans said that in some respects the new statement goes further than
current practice in the private sector. It requires that fixed assets be
included in the balance sheet at current value and be revalued at regular
intervals. Depreciation charges will then be charged in their accounts based
on these amounts.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Government 'vindicated' over Swans bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Audit Office report into the bids for a helicopter carrier
order, which left Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter facing closure,
vindicates the government's decision to award the contract to the rival
bidder, Mr Neville Trotter, Tory MP for Tynemouth, claimed yesterday.
According to Mr Trotter, the report from the government's spending watchdog,
to be made public today, says the main factor in the award was price. Both
bids were assessed by the Ministry of Defence as technically acceptable and
with the same overall level of risk.
According to the report, said Mr Trotter: 'The advice given to the ministers
on both technical and commercial aspects was correct.'
The report, he said, confirms that at the final stage, Swan Hunter bid
Pounds 210m while its rival, a consortium of Cumbria-based VSEL and the
Kvaerner Govan merchant shipyard on the Clyde, bid Pounds 139m - Pounds 71m
less.
It also says technical consultants appointed by the NAO had concluded that
assessment of the offers was thorough and that both bids were treated
fairly.
This apparently contradicts claims from Swan Hunter campaigners that the
MoD's final bidding process was biased against the company. But, according
to the disclosures, the report does confirm claims that VSEL in effect
subsidised its bid.
Mr Trotter said the report states: 'VSEL opted to take the risk of
supporting their bid significantly from the company's resources.' He added
that it says that VSEL did not want its bid figure made public.
The report is the result of an inquiry launched after Swan Hunter went into
receivership in mid-May, two days after losing the order.
According to Mr Trotter, the report also refutes claims that the bidders
were offering different ships - 'a Rolls-Royce or a Lada', as one Swans
campaigner put it. It says the consortium vessel is a warship built to
appropriate standards, which it describes as 'a cost-effective solution
without prejudicing personnel safety, financial requirements or quality'.
Mr Trotter said the report discloses that Swans increased its bid price at
the final stage by Pounds 36m, including Pounds 12m for extra overheads, at
the suggestion of GEC, then negotiating to take over the company.
Tyneside Labour MPs Mr Steve Byers and Mr Nick Brown yesterday met senior
management of Bremer Vulkan, the German shipbuilding and general engineering
group which was one of companies considering whether to bid for Swans.
As part of the campaign to retain shipbuilding on the Tyne, union leaders
met Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, to discuss the prospects of
Swan Hunter securing European intervention funding subsidy. Mr Trotter was
meeting European Commission officials in Brussels last night for talks on
prospects for Swan Hunter.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Lib Dems call for voters to have greater influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIZENS' initiatives giving people a direct voice in decision-making is at
the heart of Liberal Democrat plans yesterday aimed at popularising
constitutional reform.
The proposal would mean that a certain proportion of the voters could force
a referendum on a policy that the local council or national government was
refusing to implement. Elected bodies would, however, be able to override
opinions expressed in referendums.
Another proposal would enable up to one third of ministers in a severely
slimmed-down executive to come from outside either house of parliament. This
is aimed at tackling voters' disenchantment with the political
establishment.
The policy paper, Here We Stand, also draws together familiar Liberal
Democrat themes: a written constitution, home rule for Scotland and Wales,
regional parliaments in England, proportional representation, and an elected
second chamber.
The written constitution which accompanies the paper raises the prospect of
the entire Commons, rather than only those within the largest party,
electing the prime minister.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, called the plans 'the first serious
attempt by any political party in Britain to involve millions more people in
the decisions which affect their lives'.
He said that political institutions were at 'a new low' in people's esteem
after the 'shambles' of the Maastricht debate.

MORE PESTICIDES and chemical residues were found in drinking water last year
than in 1991, the second consecutive year to show an increase, the Drinking

Overall water quality remained the same - 98.7 per cent of the 3.75m tests
complied with the national standards, the inspectorate said in its third
annual report. Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, said: 'There is no evidence
that where the standards were not met the health of consumers was
endangered.'
Since the inspectorate was set up in January 1990 its reports have fuelled
the debate about whether some EC water directives are unnecessarily tough,
resulting in high bills for UK water customers.
Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies, said the rise in
pesticide detection was partly because sampling for pesticides had
increased.
Last year 3 per cent of water supply zones failed to meet pesticide
standards, compared with 2.8 per cent in 1991 and 2.1 per cent in 1990.
Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, called for the government to make
farmers, not customers, pay for the pollution.
Out of a total modernisation programme of Pounds 45bn the water industry is
spending some Pounds 1bn on removing pesticides. Mr Ian Byatt,
director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, has warned that customers'
bills will have to continue to rise faster than inflation throughout the
1990s.
The inspectorate said traces of coal tar in the water supply also rose last
year. Mr Owen Hydes, deputy chief inspector, said it was possible that the
coal tar could cause cancer, but only if it occurred in the water in very
large amounts.

THE conclusions of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission reports on the gas
industry will be published on August 17, the government announced yesterday.
The commission might recommend breaking up British Gas, as a way to
encourage competition in the market for household supply, or it might opt
for the status quo. It has completed a year-long review of the industry and
is due to deliver two reports by the end of the week.
The reports, formally separate but closely linked, will go to Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Sir James McKinnon,
director-general of Ofgas, the regulator. Ofgas, British Gas and the
Department of Trade and Industry then have 14 days to delete any
commercially sensitive information.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, welcomed the reports: 'A
long period of uncertainty is coming to an end.'

NEW RULES requiring councils to keep registers of fixed assets will

A new statement of recommended practice, approved last week by the

'As local authorities become more like commercial organisations they have

included in the balance sheet at current value and be revalued at regular
intervals. Depreciation charges will then be charged in their accounts based
on these amounts. There are also new guidelines to improve the presentation
of local-authority accounts.
Mr Evans said that the new rules will provide local authorities with a
'better basis for financial decision-making. At a time when all local
authorities are under pressure to perform because of constraints in their
expenditure this should sharpen up asset management.'
Local authorities have never been required to show fixed assets in their
accounts in the past.
The emphasis has been on showing outstanding borrowings on assets which were
externally financed. Assets financed from internal resources or which are
paid for have not been shown.
A pilot programme carried out by the institute in Solihull metropolitan
borough council has demonstrated the potential impact of the changes.
Solihull had previously shown fixed assets in its balance sheet of Pounds
117m. Under the proposed system, these rose more than five-fold to Pounds
588m.

ONE FIFTH of England's countryside will have been lost to urban sprawl by
2050 if development continues at the rate of the past 10 years, the Council
for the Protection of Rural England said yesterday.
Mr Tony Burton, senior planner at the environmental group, said that 15 per
cent of England is already covered by towns and cities. He called for
stricter planning laws to protect the countryside as an aesthetic and
economic resource.
'There is an economic case and an emotive case for preserving the
countryside: it is marketed widely by the tourist authorities and it touches
a very sensitive nerve amongst many people,' he said.
Mr Burton was launching a report on the changing face of England over the
past 50 years. He said the south-east region had lost as much farmland to
development as if greater London had been built all over again. In the
south-west the urban area has grown by 70 per cent since 1945.
Overall, England has lost 700,000 hectares of farmland to urban sprawl in
the past 50 years.
Mr Burton called on the government to target the 150,000 hectares of
derelict land in cities before it opens up more countryside for building. He
also criticised the government's policy of building more roads as the single
most important aspect of government policy responsible for rural land loss.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Lenders seize fewer homes
</HEADLINE>

THE NUMBER of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders has fallen for the third
consecutive six-month period.
However, the number of households with arrears of 12 months or more has
increased from 147,040 in the second half of last year to 158,000 in the
first half of this year.
Figures issued yesterday by the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed a fall of
11 per cent in repossessions in the first half of this year to 31,780,
compared with 35,750 for the same period last year. The total number of
repossessions last year was 68,540, down from the 1991 peak of 75,540.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the council, attributed the fall to
cuts in interest rates and to economic recovery, which he said had
contributed to a reversal in the upward trend in unemployment.
He also said that the government's decision to pay income support for
mortgage interest direct to lenders had contributed to the improvement.
Mr Coles added: 'The worst of the arrears and possessions problem now
appears to be over.' But he warned that 'it would be unrealistic to expect a
rapid reduction in the figures over the next few months'.
He added that there was 'no euphoria' on the part of lenders, who recognised
that 'there is still an important problem out there'.
In the first half of this year there were 349,560 households in arrears of
six months or more. That figure is down fractionally on the 352,050 in the
last half of 1992, but up on the first half of 1992, when the figure was
305,140.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at UBS, said he had cut 5,000
off his forecast for the total number of repossessions for the year, to
65,000, but said he expected repossessions to average 60,000 to 65,000 for
up to three years because of the large number of households in mortgage
arrears.
Mortgage lenders held 54,330 unsold repossessed properties at the end of
June against 64,970 last December.
Separate figures released yesterday by the Lord Chancellor's Office for
court orders to repossess properties confirmed that there were 53,436 court
orders for repossession in the first half of this year - down 22 per cent
from 68,638 in the same period last year.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Unit trusts reach Pounds 76.3bn record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT TRUST sales enjoyed their second-best quarter on record in the three
months to the end of June, with net sales reaching nearly Pounds 2.5bn.
Total funds invested in unit trusts reached an all-time high of Pounds
76.3bn, compared with Pounds 57bn at the end of June 1992.
Figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds showed that
sales of personal equity plans played an important role.
Returns within a Pep are tax-free and after the recent falls in interest
rates some Peps can now offer higher income returns than building society
deposits. Net sales of unit trust Peps in the second quarter were Pounds
741.5m, up from Pounds 336.4m in the same period last year.
But even without the tax attractions of Peps, investors seem to be switching
from cash to equities. Overall, private investors bought a net Pounds 1.98bn
of unit trusts in the first half of the year; the industry made net
repurchases from private investors in the first half of 1992. The only time
that the current level of unit trust sales has been exceeded was in the
third quarter of 1987, just before the stock market crash of October that
year.
The sector which attracted the most money from private investors was UK
Balanced, which combines bonds and equities to offer a high income.
The industry continues to launch new funds. There are now 1,537 trusts
managed by 160 groups.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Agents expect more gazumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESTATE agents yesterday said that this week's Court of Appeal ruling against
a seller who gazumped a buyer was welcome but in practice would have little
impact on the property market.
The ruling followed the case of Mr Tim Pitt, a broker who successfully sued
a company that made a written agreement to sell him a Suffolk cottage for
Pounds 200,000 but later sold to a bidder who offered Pounds 10,000 more. Mr
Pitt refused to match the higher bid and took the company to court for
breach of contract.
Lawyers decided that the faxed agreement amounted to a binding contract.
This sets a precedent - previously nothing has been regarded as binding
until the final exchange of contracts, which can come several months after
an offer is made.
'The curtain has not come down on gazumping,' said Mr Tony Clark, general
secretary of the British Association of Estate Agents.
'It takes our campaign against gazumping a little stage further,' he said.
But he pointed out that in practice sellers would be extremely wary of such
'lock-out' agreements.
He added: 'Solicitors will advise the average purchaser to try to obtain a
lock-out agreement but vendors will be advised at the same time not to enter
into them.'
Purchasers in a chain would also find it difficult to meet the likely
conditions of a lock-out clause, the association warned.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Gilts sale confounds pessimists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government raised Pounds 3.25bn at its latest gilts auction yesterday,
as conviction that interest rates need to fall further and inflation will
remain low attracted strong demand.
The amount raised, through offering 7 per cent stock maturing in 2001,
matched the record sum achieved only four weeks ago and takes the government
halfway through its borrowing programme only four months into the financial
year.
The cover - the ratio of bids to offers - at the Bank of England's auction
was 2.29, confounding pessimists who had expected a cover between only one
and two times.
More significantly, bidding was so tight that there was no difference
between the average accepted price of 97.06, giving a yield of 7.46 per
cent, and the lowest accepted bid price.
Mr Roger Bootle, economist with Midland Global Markets, said: 'The auction
went incredibly well. There was a worry that it could be a flop because the
maturity was a bit odd but the CBI survey and the news from Europe could not
have come at a better time.'
Underlying gilt prices jumped sharply, with stock comparable to the auction
issue rising  3/4 point. In the more liquid futures market, the 10-year
contract for September delivery shot up more than a percentage point before
investors started profit-taking.
Market analysts initially were worried about demand because of the seemingly
strange choice of maturity. Stock expiring in eight years does not have a
natural investor target as UK banks and building societies prefer gilts
expiring in three years, while overseas buyers favour 10-year maturities
which fit well with their own 10-year benchmark bonds. UK pension funds
favour very long-dated maturities, such as the 2017 stock, to match their
liabilities.
The CBI quarterly regional survey, published on Tuesday, called for a
further cut in base rates to kick-start an economy which is still bumping
along the bottom. Its appeal received further impetus from the recent
turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism, which has prompted
growing conviction that continental rates have to fall further if the ERM is
to survive and are bound to be cut if the ERM crumbles.
The gilts auction was also helped by news that the Bundesbank eased its
repurchase agreement rate, paving the way for a probable cut in its official
discount rate today.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Mines at risk as bidders stay away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF RESCUE for a large number of pits discarded by British Coal were
fading last night after it emerged that private-sector companies were
interested in mining only one of the first four on offer.
British Coal said it had received bids, accompanied by bonds of Pounds
50,000, for three of the four pits. However, in two cases, Cotgrave and
Silverhill in Nottinghamshire, the proposals involved only the surface
assets of the mines and there were no plans for continuing mining at them.
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers has already announced the formation of a
joint venture with Vista Partnership in an attempt to create up to 900 jobs
for former miners at Cotgrave and Silverhill. The plan is to build domestic
waste recycling and disposal facilities on the sites.
The one pit of the four where mining may still continue is Easington in
Durham. RJB Mining is thought to be among the bidders and may be the only
one.
Yesterday's developments mean British Coal is likely to move swiftly to
close finally the Bolsover mine in Derbyshire, the last of the four to be
offered in the first batch. Another 15 pits are on offer with bidding
deadlines still open.
Industry observers believe it is unlikely that more than six of the 19 pits
will be mined, although more than 300 initial expressions of interest have
been received by British Coal.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Debt tightens its grip and threatens to hit recovery: How
consumers' debts have hardly fallen, leaving them still too frightened
either to spend or to borrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALES of families whose lives fell apart because they could not pay their
debts were common during the worst months of the recession.
Those stories have faded since the UK left the European exchange rate
mechanism, interest rates came down and there was indisputable evidence of
economic recovery.
But official figures show that debt levels have barely left the heights of
the recession, and the problem of households whose mortgage debts are
greater than the value of their homes has worsened.
The stubbornly high debt levels, together with weak personal wealth and high
real interest rates, mean that people are likely to continue repaying their
debts and avoiding further loans, possibly delaying a recovery in consumer
spending.
Net personal-sector savings have fallen as a percentage of personal
disposable income since the end of the recession, but at 10.3 per cent are
still much higher than in the mid-1980s when the savings ratio was 5.1 per
cent.
As a percentage of total personal disposable income, personal-sector debt
rose from less than half in 1980 to more than disposable income in 1990.
Last year it slipped back to more than 90 per cent of total income, an
improvement on 1992 levels but still extremely high by historical standards.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England estimates that the number of households with
negative equity - mortgages worth more than their homes - rose from 1m in
the second quarter last year to 1.8m in the first quarter of 1993.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at brokers UBS, believes it will take
up to five years to restore the value of houses to pre-recession levels,
pointing out that some house prices in the south-east fell by more than 30
per cent. He said: 'It is a five-year problem because we are not going to
have another 1980s-style boom to bail people out.'
High levels of debt and the persistance of negative equity could explain why
the sharp reduction in interest rates, from 15 per cent to six per cent over
two years, has had only a limited impact on consumer spending, and why the
Treasury has a conservative forecast for an increase in consumer spending
this year of only 1 1/4 per cent.
A reduction in interest rates on that scale would normally be expected to
produce a stronger recovery than this one is proving. The conclusion among
most economists is that although the cost of servicing debts has been
slashed, outstanding debt is acting as a significant drag on recovery, in
particular by reducing people's desire to take on new borrowing.
But why is it taking consumers so long to pay off their debts and regain the
confidence to borrow? One problem is that with headline inflation of only
1.2 per cent, real interest rates are high. This means it is still very
expensive to service debts.
Another factor is the drop in personal wealth, particularly in relation to
house prices. Wealth has risen compared with a year ago, but this reflects
capital gains on the portfolios of life assurance and pension funds rather
than rises in house prices.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers in London, believes
that although the increased profits will eventually be paid to households,
in the short-term they are unlikely to alter people's willingness to borrow
and spend.
The factor that is much more likely to influence people's spending pattersn
is house prices. Using a measure of personal wealth that excludes assets
held by life assurance and pension funds, Mr Saunders calculated that
personal wealth has risen in the past two quarters in real terms, but is
still 4 per cent below a year ago and 19.5 per cent below December 1989.
'Net housing wealth - houses less mortgage debt - accounts for such a large
share, 54 per cent, of total personal wealth. Thus real wealth will remain
sluggish until house prices rise above year-ago levels,' he said.
If Mr Saunders is right, the outlook for consumer spending remains
uncertain. Debt is one factor constraining activity. Next year tax increases
and slowing wage growth will add to consumer woes.
Alternatively, the widely expected falls in unemployment and further
increases in house prices may prove to be stronger forces in persuading
consumers to borrow again. Indeed, some economists believe the problem of
the debt overhang has been exaggerated.
Mr Kevin Gardiner at SG Warburg Securities said that the bad news on debt is
mainly confined to people in the south-east who bought houses in the late
1980s.
He said consumer spending has remained fairly strong since the recession and
predicts that soon the old problem of high consumer goods import penetration
will reassert itself.

FT  29 JUL 93 / CBI backs pensions for all at 65
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry, the employers group, yesterday urged
the government to stop dithering and raise women's retirement age to 65.
It said: 'The present indecision is causing real concern in the business
community. It is time they made up their minds. A decision needs to be
announced soon with a lengthy phasing-in so that the position of women
currently planning to retire at 60 is fully protected.'
A survey by William M Mercer, actuarial consultant, for the CBI concluded
that lowering men's retirement ages to match those of women would increase
existing occupational pension liabilities by Pounds 21bn. It would also add
Pounds 2bn a year to the cost of offering the existing level of occupational
pension benefit.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said: 'Faced with such costs, more
firms would have to consider cutting the pensions offered or moving away
from pensions linked to final salaries.'
Many European countries have equal retirement ages for men and women, but
while British women are generally eligible to receive pensions from age 60,
most men must wait until 65.
A government white paper on pensions policy has already been delayed and it
not likely to be published until the autumn.
The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association,
has urged the government to make a speedy decision.
Mr Davies said: 'The present indecision is causing real concern in the
business community. A decision needs to be announced soon with a lengthy
phasing-in (period).'
He argued that if the pensionable age were reduced, the government would be
stepping 'out of line with international trends.'
Mr Davies said: 'The Germans plan to move to an equal pension age of 65 by
2012 and the Italians by 2016, while the Americans are moving by stages to
equalisation at 67 by 2027.
'The UK government should similarly make it clear its intention to move over
a period of years to an equalised state pension age of 65.'

OPTIONS for tax increases in the November Budget will be discussed tomorrow
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, at a private meeting in his official
country home at Dorneywood, Buckinghamshire, Peter Marsh writes.
Mr Clarke will talk about the Budget with other Treasury ministers and
senior officials. The group is expected to consider proposals for increasing
taxes from April, as part of the effort to bring down the rising budget
deficit - expected to be Pounds 50bn this financial year. Any tax increases
would come on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of tax rises which have already been
announced.
The meeting will review the latest unpublished Treasury forecasts that gross
domestic product this year will grow slightly faster than the 1.25 per cent
predicted by officials in March. However, in recent weeks signs have emerged
that the solid growth of the first half of the year might not be sustained
in the second half, owing to weak UK demand and a deterioration in export
markets in continental Europe.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Labour U-turn over high taxes and spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN last night signalled a permanent break with Labour's high
public spending and tax policies, pledging to replace them with an economic
strategy designed to advance individual opportunity.
In a blunt assessment directed as much at the party faithful as at the wider
electorate, the shadow chancellor said that Labour would remain unelectable
as long as it was seen as hostile to individual aspiration.
His statement - completing the U-turn in economic policy which began after
last year's general election defeat - said that Labour must abandon 'the
attempt to freshen up old postures by ever more extravagant new spending or
borrowing commitments'.
It marked the beginning of a fresh attempt by the Labour leadership to push
the party's economic policy further towards the political centre ground and,
crucially, to broaden the party's appeal to the affluent working and middle
classes.
Mr Brown said that Labour's analysis of successive election defeats since
1979 had shown the electorate was unwilling to elect a party which was
perceived as 'wanting to tax people for its own sake'. Past shopping lists
of spending commitments designed to appeal to particular groups would be a
replaced by a strategy designed to tie all tax and spending policies to
objectives which 'increase the individual's prosperity and quality of life'.
He said: 'Put simply, we do not look for increased opportunities to tax; we
will not tax unless we increase opportunities for people.'
Mr Brown sought to answer criticism that he has failed to exploit the
Conservatives' economic 'failure' by dismissing the arguments of those in
the Labour party who equated radicalism with adding billions to whatever
happened to be the government's spending or borrowing total.
Instead Labour had to broaden its appeal to become the party of opportunity,
not only for its traditional supporters but also for 'millions of small
businessmen and women and for the self-employed'.
He said that the party should learn the lesson also of the approach adopted
by Lady Thatcher when she led the Tory opposition in the late 1970s. Instead
of offering detailed plans on spending or tax, she adopted the tactic of
pressing a broad set of themes built around the principle of enhancing
opportunity.

FT  29 JUL 93 / BBC sets 'robust' reform targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC's governors yesterday set targets for the corporation for next year,
including sharper coverage of science and technology and ensuring
interviewees are treated with courtesy.
In their first annual review of the BBC's performance the governors also
said they would require assurance that financial controls are robust.
They want to see that 'managers are using the newly provided financial
information to achieve further efficiency gains and that no new bureaucracy
is emerging to replace the one so recently dismantled'.
The governors said that the diversion of resources from bureaucracy and
overheads to creative programme-making must continue because it was at the
heart of the reforms now being introduced.
Having defined their role for the first time as 'trustees for the public',
in future the governors' job will include ensuring that the BBC's strategy
reflects the public's needs and interests, ensuring compliance with
regulations and guidelines and, for the first time, publishing a regular
programme complaints bulletin.
The review says that in the past three years the BBC has cut its overheads
by a net 5.2 per cent a year and costs in the resource departments were cut
by 2.5 per cent a year, releasing an extra Pounds 65m for programme-making.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Challenge to Law Society regulators fails in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 77-year-old woman who sued the Law Society, the solicitors' professional
body, for alleged failure to make a proper investigation of her complaint
against her former solicitors yesterday lost her legal battle in the High
Court.
Miss Peggy Wood, of Portsmouth, Hants, claimed that if the society had taken
action to investigate her complaints against Hubbard &amp; Co of Chichester,
West Sussex, in 1979 and 1983, they could have prevented her losing her home
and development land.
Her action was widely seen as a test case of whether regulatory bodies owe a
duty of care to the public in investigating complaints and, if they do,
whether they must pay damages to those who suffer loss as a result of their
failure to uphold that duty.
But yesterday Mr Justice Otton ruled that there was no general duty of care
owed by regulatory bodies to the public and that in Miss Wood's case there
was not a sufficiently close and direct relationship between her and the
society for a duty of care to arise.
The judge said that if the society had owed Miss Wood a duty of care he
would have had no hesitation in finding that its mishandling of her
complaint in 1979 'fell so far below the standards expected of the law
society as to have amounted to negligence'.
But if the society intervened in 1979 or in 1983 it was unlikely to have
prevented Miss Wood losing her home. Mrs Wood's complaint against Hubbards
dates back to 1973 when, having been left without any income, she approached
Mrs Sylvia Hubbard about obtaining four loans totalling Pounds 10,000 on her
home.
When she was unable to repay the loans, Hubbard &amp; Co acted against her on
behalf of the lenders. The main lender, Mobile Homes, was 50 per cent owned
by Mrs Hubbard's husband, Joseph, then also a partner in the law firm.
When Miss Wood was evicted and the house sold, she was left with just Pounds
1,400 after all her debts had been paid. After development the property was
resold for almost Pounds 200,000.
Mr Justice Otton said the real reason she had eventually been evicted was
because she was unable to raise enough money to satisfy her creditors.
He concluded: 'However heart-rending her story and however much I understand
and sympathise with it, authority and principle are heavily weighted against
her claim.'
After the hearing Miss Wood said: 'It's a bleak day for all complainants.
It's a lost opportunity for the courts to give protection against the
mistakes and omissions of regulatory bodies.'

FT  29 JUL 93 / New prototype of the AC Ace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A pre-production prototype of the AC Ace, a modern version of the classic
sports car of the 1950s and 1960s, went on show yesterday with five
original-style but brand-new AC Cobras at Waterhouse Square in the City of
London.
There is no launch date yet for the Ace, which is made by Weybridge-based AC
Cars, the UK's oldest surviving carmaker.
The prototype uses a 2.8-litre V6 engine made by Ford, which until last year
had a 50.96 per cent stake in AC. The US-based carmaker bought the stake
mainly because of AC's production of the Ford-engined Cobra, a big
image-builder for Ford which in the 1960s sold the car through its North
American dealer network.
Ford sold the stake back to Mr Brian Angliss, AC Cars' managing director,
who has been seeking a new financial partner to bring the Ace into
production.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Police arrest Nadir tax inspector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TAX investigator involved in inquiries into the financial affairs of Mr
Asil Nadir, the fugitive tycoon, was arrested yesterday by detectives
probing 'alleged corruption'.
Mr Michael Allcock and his wife Sally were taken from their home in
Chelmsford, Essex, to London for questioning by Metropolitan and City of
London Fraud Squad officers.
The couple were released on police bail and ordered to report back to
Holborn police station in October, Scotland Yard said.
Mr Allcock is the tax inspector accused by Mr Michael Mates, the former
Northern Ireland minister, of 'improper collusion' with the Serious Fraud
Office.
Mr Mates, who resigned over the Nadir affair last month, said that Mr
Allcock tipped off the SFO. However Mr Allcock, in an interview with the
Financial Times earlier this month, insisted instead that he had reported
his suspicions about Mr Nadir, who jumped bail in May, to the Stock
Exchange.
Mr Allcock was suspended in September as head of the Revenue's Special
Office 2, its crack investigative unit, on full pay pending a Fraud Squad
investigation following an internal inquiry, not related to the Nadir
affair, by Revenue officials.
In the FT interview he gave details of how he worked closely with the
exchange in its investigation of Mr Nadir's financial affairs and those of
Swiss companies believed to be fronting for him.
The exchange has acknowledged that it received corroborative information
from the Revenue that led it to ask the SFO to carry out the first of its
raids on Mr Nadir's companies.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Crisis talks as Independent's sales slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday, meets today amid a growing sense of crisis over
falling sales and financial uncertainty.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder of The Independent, will offer his
resignation to other directors as chief executive to concentrate on
developing the papers and his role as editor.
There is also likely to be a debate over a controversial business plan which
will be submitted to the meeting.
The plan suggests raising Pounds 1.5m for each newspaper - a great deal less
than was widely expected.
This will have to pay for the introduction of colour printing, the launching
of new sections and promotion of the titles.
There are fears that the sum may be inadequate to meet the intensified
competition expected in the autumn from The Times and from a re-launched
Observer, now owned by The Guardian. More money could however be raised in
the autumn.
The two main shareholders of Newspaper Publishing, El Pais of Spain and La
Repubblica of Italy, who own 18 per cent each, have made it clear they are
prepared to invest substantial sums and take their stakes up to 25 per cent
each through a rights issue. They are likely to be unhappy about what is
being proposed although both groups are still supportive of Newspaper
Publishing.
The Pounds 3m proposed in the new business plan could be largely raised
through borrowings and cost-cutting, thus leaving the present shareholding
structure intact. This would leave control still in the hands of Mr Whittam
Smith.
Although sales of general broadsheet newspapers have been falling over the
past few months the Newspaper Publishing titles have been particularly badly
hit and their circulations have dropped month after month.
Between March and June the circulation of The Independent fell from 354,178
to 338,823. In April 1992 the circulation stood at 389,523.
The Independent on Sunday, which in October 1992 had a circulation of
425,803, had dropped to 387,511 in March and 376,859 by June.
A number of senior staff believe that urgent action is now needed to avoid a
growing crisis and question whether Pounds 3m could possibly be enough to
turn round the fortunes of the newspaper group.
Some staff are now even questioning whether Newspaper Publishing can be
viable as a stand-alone company. Most of its rivals are part of larger
groups.
In the year to September 1992 Newspaper Publishing made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 28,000 compared to a loss of Pounds 10m in 1991. Staff believe that
the group is now trading at a loss - as much as Pounds 2m a year.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Media groups to join lottery bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications and Associated Newspapers are about to join the
Granada-led consortium planning to bid for the licence to operate the new
national lottery.
An announcement is expected today that the groups have joined the
consortium, The Great British Lottery Company.
Carlton, which holds the London weekday ITV licence, and Associated
Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, are each
believed to be taking a 10 per cent stake in the venture.
The main members of the consortium are Granada, the leisure group, and the
Vodafone Group, the mobile telecommunications concern, each with 35 per
cent. Hambros, the merchant bank that put the consortium together, also has
a 10 per cent stake. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, is
executive chairman of the consortium.
The new shareholders should help to make the consortium one of the leading
contenders for the lottery, which is due to be launched late next year or
early in 1995.
The lottery, which could eventually have annual revenues of Pounds
3bn-Pounds 5bn, is designed to raise money for charity, the arts, sport,
national heritage and celebrating the millennium. The national lottery bill
is due to receive royal assent in October.
So far, the lottery licence's other main contenders include NM Rothschild,
the merchant bank, in a joint venture with Tattersall's, the Australian
company which runs the state lottery in Victoria; the Rank Organisation; and
a consortium put together by GTECH of the US, which supplies lottery
equipment and runs lotteries all over the world. Bids are also expected from
the leading football pools companies Littlewoods and Vernons, part of
Ladbroke's.
The National Heritage Department is expected to announce by the middle of
next month the appointment of a regulatory adviser, who would also probably
become director-general designate of the Office of the National Lottery.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Mozer's plea pact ruled still valid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US JUDGE ruled yesterday that a plea agreement between government
prosecutors and Mr Paul Mozer, the former Salomon Brothers trader at the
centre of the 1991 Treasury auction scandal, was still valid.
The agreement had been rejected by another judge in January after Mr Mozer's
lawyers had clashed with prosecutors over their interpretation of the
wording of the document.
Under the terms of the agreement Mr Mozer pleaded guilty to two felony
counts of making false statements to US officials about fake bids he had
submitted at a February 1991 auction of Treasury notes.
Mr Stanley Arkin, Mr Mozer's lawyer, argued in January that as far as he was
concerned the plea ensured the government could not bring additional
criminal charges against his client on possible violations of anti-trust
laws.
Federal prosecutors, however, disagreed and insisted the plea still left
open the possibility of anti-trust charges.
On January 11, Judge Robert Patterson decided that the serious nature of the
disagreement between the two sides meant he could not accept Mr Mozer's
guilty plea. Yesterday, however, Judge Pierre Leval ruled that the federal
prosecutors could not back out of the original agreement, arguing that the
government had 'acted inconsistently with the terms of the plea agreement'.
The ruling improves Mr Mozer's chances of escaping a jail sentence. If the
judge had ruled the plea invalid, Mr Mozer would have faced the four
criminal charges, including fraud, that were filed by prosecutors after the
plea agreement collapsed. If found guilty, he could have faced a long jail
term.
Federal prosecutors said yesterday they would not appeal Judge Leval's
decision.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Delays cast doubt on Brazilian sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS are growing among Brazilian investors about President Itamar Franco's
conversion to the privatisation cause in the face of a series of delays,
including the postponement of two sales this week.
All of Brazil's four finance ministers during the 10-month-old Franco
government have cited acceleration of privatisation as a crucial policy.
Mr Franco, a former opponent of privatisation, moved to back the policy
after realising that supporting the state sector was draining Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 6.7bn) a year from the Treasury.
Yet the reality is that while much of Latin America is speeding ahead with
bold programmes, Brazil's plans have been grinding to a halt.
Only two companies have been sold this year and eight sales have been
postponed, leaving more than 120 companies in state hands. Mr Franco has
transferred the power of final approval over minimum price to the Senate,
which is expected to add to the delays.
No important companies have been put on the 'for sale' list, despite
consensus that selling off some of the big parastatals such as Vale do Rio
Doce, the state mining company, would help to plug the fiscal deficit.
One of the main reasons for the slowdown is division within the Franco team.
Some ministers, such as Mr Paulino Cicero, the energy minister, while
resigned to privatisation as a whole, object to the sale of specific
companies.
Five working groups are studying measures to speed up the process, make it
more lucrative and protect against creation of private monopolies. Direct
sales or share offers through Banco do Brasil may replace the auction
method.
Further changes may result from recent congressional approval of legislation
allowing private sector concessions to run public services and a vote to
lift the 40 per cent limit on foreign ownership.
Some analysts suspect the studies to be delaying tactics. However, Mr Igor
Cornelsen, director of Chartered West LB in Sao Paulo, said: 'I think they
want to privatise but they don't know how to and they don't trust investment
bankers to tell them how.'
The new rules are expected to be announced in September. In the meantime,
the delays are not only allowing anti-privatisation lobbies to muster
forces, but are also costing the government money.
The sale of the Cosipa steel mill has just been delayed to August 11 at the
earliest. The mill is costing the government Dollars 1m a day in debt
interest. Sale of the PQU petrochemicals company was also postponed. A row
has erupted between Mr Franco and the foreign ministry after the president
publicly attacked the country's most senior ambassadors overseas for failing
to defend the government against the international outcry over the massacre
last Friday of seven street children.
Mr Franco said he was 'highly dissatisfied' with his ambassadors in London,
Washington, Rome, Paris and New York among others and was considering
replacing them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US television network, has agreed to pay a record Dollars 456m for
US broadcast rights to the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta, despite losing
Dollars 100m on the games in Barcelona. It beat bids of about Dollars 450m
from ABC, regarded as the front-runner, and Dollars 415m from CBS.
Mr Billy Payne, chief of the Atlanta committee for the Olympic Games, had
hoped for more but said he was 'doggone happy' with the NBC bid.
The audience is expected to be the largest in Olympic history. Mr Dick
Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, said he expected to make a profit and was
confident enough to offer the International Olympic Committee and the
Atlanta one a share of revenues if advertising sales exceeded Dollars 615m.
NBC's bid did not include a cable partner. Turner Broadcasting System, based
in Atlanta, declined to put up any money for the rights fee.
The European broadcasting rights were sold earlier this year for Dollars
250m to the European Broadcasting Union.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japanese steel industry disappointed with
dumping charge

THE Japanese steel industry was disappointed by the decision to uphold a
dumping charge against corrosion-resistant steel sheet, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto in Tokyo.
'The decision is difficult to understand,' the Japan Iron and Steel
Federation said. The industry has focused on exporting high-quality products
to the US and has maintained prices at levels generally higher than those
set by US mills. It has also attempted to keep export volumes at levels
appropriate to meet US demand.
The federation warned that the ITC's ruling risked damaging the
international competitiveness of US steel users as well as prospects for a
new Multilateral Steel Agreement. Talks on an MSA are set to resume in
Geneva in autumn.
Japanese steelmakers face duties of 40.19 per cent on corrosion-resistant
sheet, which accounted for less than 4 per cent of steel exports to the US
last year. Manufacturers said they planned to increase production at their
US joint venture mills to minimise the impact.
Industry officials said the decision could affect the relationship between
US and Japanese steel companies, which have invested heavily in American
steel mills, entered into joint ventures and provided technology in an
effort to shift to higher value added exports.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Durable goods orders rise sharply in US: Three-month decline
reversed
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORDERS for durable goods climbed sharply last month in the US, providing
some underpinning for more optimistic assessments of the economic recovery.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose by 3.8 per
cent between May and June, reversing three months of decline.
Although the sharp rise was heavily dependent on a 42 per cent surge in
aircraft orders, a particularly volatile segment of the statistics, cars and
electronic components also rose.
Transport sector orders rose by 15.1 per cent, the department said, while
orders for electronics and electrical equipment went up by 3.3 per cent.
Primary metals orders increased more modestly, and orders for industrial
machinery and equipment fell by 1 per cent.
Shipments, however, showed a more evenly spread increase of 2.3 per cent
from May to June, with transport equipment up 4.8 per cent, primary metals
up 3.5 per cent, and electronics and electrical equipment up 3.3 per cent.
Although figures for earlier months were revised downward, making
yesterday's month-on-month increase appear larger, economists noted that
durable goods orders were still 6 per cent higher in June than they had been
a year earlier, and orders for the first six months of the year were almost
8 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992.
With government spending severely constrained and consumer confidence still
shaky, capital investment has been among the principal motors of the stolid
US economic recovery.
The 10.9 per cent rise in capital goods orders last month largely reflected
new aircraft orders, but even if aircraft and parts are excluded, capital
goods orders still rose 0.7 per cent in June.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US trade watchdog displays its mettle over
steel - By dismissing 'unfair' complaints the ITC has sent a clear signal
that it is not a puppet of Washington political lobbies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   IF SPIRITS were low in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the heartland of 'Big Steel' in the US - after the International Trade
Commission this week threw out 40 of 72 'unfair' trade complaints on steel,
the reaction in Pittsburgh, California, was profound relief.
'I'm thrilled that the ITC voted for free trade and American jobs,' said Mr
Bill Baker, the California district's congressman, who had warned that a
tariff on hot-rolled steel from Korea would have 'killed' the
state-of-the-art USS-POSCO steel finishing plant there, built as a joint
venture between US Steel and the South Korean group Pohang Steel.
The ITC decision to overturn so many provisional dumping and countervailing
duties came as a shock to many. It sent important signals to US steelmakers
that they cannot expect protection as they struggle to compete with new
technologies and depressed international demand. Tumbling share prices were
an eloquent measure of public reaction.
It also sent important signals to foreign governments that the ITC is not a
puppet of Washington's political lobbies. At a time when the fairness of the
US anti-dumping regime is being questioned, it showed the law can and does
work more objectively than many like to believe.
Mr Baker's joy at the negative injury finding on the Korean product was
shared by many US steel users who feared the duties would damage their
international competitiveness.
The country's integrated steelmakers took a dimmer view. Of the 7.8m tonnes
of flat-rolled steel covered by the steel industry's original complaints -
which were upheld by the Commerce Department in January this year,
triggering the imposition of provisional duties - just 3.4m tonnes will now
be subject to duties ranging up to 109 per cent.
'It's hard to judge the results as you would a ball game,' said Mr Jon
Jenson, spokesman for the Coalition of American Businesses for Stable Steel
Supplies, which represents steel users.
The losing users would either have to pay high tariffs on their imports and
find themselves uncompetitive internationally or find a domestic source of
less satisfactory domestic supplies, Mr Jenson said.
The 12 US steelmakers who filed their allegations of dumping and unfair
subsidies last year, after the collapse of international negotiations aimed
at a Multilateral Steel Agreement, were glum yesterday. They have poured
millions of dollars into legal fees on the cases, and are now considering
spending millions more.
They might appeal against the ITC decision to the Court of International
Trade, or bring new cases in the coming months, a spokesmen said.
But it was more than steel imports that were on trial on Tuesday when the
ITC commissioners each cast 72 votes, product by product, on whether dumped
or subsidised imports were injuring the domestic industry. It was the
commission itself on trial, before a world trading community which -
misunderstanding the complexities of the US 'unfair trade' regime -
generally suspects its findings may be politically 'fixed' by the
administration.
Although many trade lawyers believe the laws are biased towards the domestic
industry, the ITC was designed to screen out politics. No more than three of
the six commissioners can be of one party; terms are for nine years, and a
commissioner cannot serve a second full term.
The commissioners cannot discuss their votes among themselves, and hear each
other's votes for the first time when the public does.
Mrs Paula Stern, a former ITC chairwoman, was unsurprised by Tuesday's vote.
'The cynicism about the independence of the commission is grossly unfair,'
she said.
During the vote on Tuesday Mr David Rohr, a Democratic commissioner,
addressed accusations that politics played a role in the ITC's finding.
'Though there may be differing political persuasions among commissioners,
that has no bearing on today's result,' he said.
One by one the commissioners described sifting through mountains of evidence
 -25,000 pages of questionnaire responses, and 61 volumes of briefs - and
the factors they had to assess in reaching their decisions.
Ms Janet Nuzum, a Democratic commissioner, said: 'The fact that different
commissioners have decided differently in particular products or particular
countries is a reflection of the variety of factors we must consider, the
extensiveness of the evidence, and the complexity of the record.'
Ms Carol Crawford, a Republican commissioner, caught the mood of most when
she said she believed a small amount of imports were 'unlikely to have an
adverse effect on the domestic industry's market share price or revenues'.
But where the import penetration was significant, she voted for injury.
The way is now clear for negotiation of a Multilateral Steel Agreement,
where, according to Mrs Stern, 'negotiators had their hands tied because
they had the dumping cases pending'. Still, she warned, the MSA 'must not be
seen as nirvana' because it will deal only with steel subsidies, and thus
dumping, in the future.
'We still have a raging debate in the Uruguay Round on how the dumping laws
should operate,' she said, adding that the US anti-dumping regime still
failed to recognise the needs of steel users whose exports must compete
abroad.

<TEXT>
IN THE two years since Intracom, the Greek telecoms and information systems
manufacturer, set up automated 'lotto' games in Russia, its blue and yellow
kiosks have sprung up in more than 130 Russian cities.
Olympic Lottery, a Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) joint venture with the Russian
Olympic Committee, was the first in a series of deals with state-controlled
lottery and sports organisations through which Intracom aims to position
itself as a telecoms supplier to eastern Europe.
Next month the Romanian state lottery system will launch a lotto game
designed and installed by Intracom, and by the end of the year similar games
should be operating in Bulgaria, Ukraine and Moldova. Kazakhstan will follow
in 1994.
Mr Constantinos Antonopoulos of Intralot, the lottery subsidiary of
Intracom, said: 'We have to take a flexible approach to this market because
we can't compete with the international telecoms companies on large
government contracts. But we have other projects (from rural telephone
networks to information systems for banks) where negotiations are well
advanced. In the meantime, we're traders as well.'
Intracom, in which Ericsson of Sweden holds a minority stake, sets its
initial investment in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at Dollars
70m. The joint ventures should start to show a profit within two years.
Intralot spends part of its rouble income on consumer goods - from cosmetics
to disposable razors - which are sold at the kiosks where lotto players hand
in their coupons.
The joint venture has also become a distributor for Reynolds of the US,
selling cigarettes through its 3,000 outlets.
Intracom based the 'Lotto Million' game on games developed for the Greek and
Cypriot state lottery and football pool systems. With a first prize of
Rbs140m the weekly draw, shown on television, is one of Russia's top
programmes.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Clinton in final budget blitz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has begun a last-ditch lobbying effort to win support
for his endangered budget package with a blitz of briefings and lunches for
businessmen and journalists from key states.
Special White House events have targeted Georgia, home of Senator Sam Nunn,
one of the handful of Democrats who deserted the president on the budget's
initial passage in the Senate. Also singled out is Texas, home of
Congressman Charles Stenholm, leader of a rebellious bloc in the House of
Representatives which is fighting the inclusion of an energy tax.
Mr Clinton yesterday paraded 60 top business leaders who have signed up in
support of his budget plan. They include Mr Lodwrick Cook, head of the Arco
oil group, Mr Paul Allaire, chief executive of Xerox, Mr Dwayne Andreas,
head of Archer Daniels Midland, Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, Mr Curtis
Barnette, chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, and Mr Deryck Maughan, chief
executive of Salomon Brothers.
But for all the White House's efforts to portray the budget as a desperately
needed change in direction, Congress has already tinkered with it so much
that it has moved back heavily towards the status quo.
Mr Clinton could never quite steel himself to cut some of the most obviously
extravagant programmes, such as the space station or the super-conducting
supercollider. But even some of the wholly outdated subsidy programmes,
whose elimination took on symbolic importance in his election campaign last
year, have come back from the dead.
The single most specific spending cut in his economic programme was the
ending of the subsidy for honey producers, which is expected to cost around
Dollars 30m next year. Yet the Senate this week voted only to reduce the
subsidy, which is supposed to ensure that the US has enough bees to
pollinate valuable crops.
Also, after taking a courageous stand on ending subsidies to preserve
strategic supplies of mohair on Monday, the Senate changed its mind on
Tuesday and voted to preserve the programme, which costs around Dollars 48m
a year.
These small changes add up to more than small change, and have made it much
harder for budget negotiators to come up with a deal that still meets Mr
Clinton's objective of cutting the federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn
from its projected path over the next five years.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, has been left wringing his hands and
insisting that some form of energy tax - the most hotly contested element of
the package - is essential in order to achieve Dollars 500bn of deficit
reduction.
Efforts are under way to craft some form of executive order that would cap
future spending on entitlements such as pension and medical benefits, which
could be enough to buy off the opposition of Democratic budget hawks.
Nevertheless, administration officials and congressional leaders insist that
they will reach agreement on a compromise budget in time for it to be voted
through before the summer recess, scheduled for August 6.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC sees opening for new regime - Ruling
against US steelmakers draws a mixed response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CASE for a new Multilateral Steel Arrangement has been strengthened by
the US International Trade Commission's largely favourable ruling this week
against big US steelmakers, EC officials said yesterday.
Relieved that the ITC had discarded many of the complaints against foreign
imports, the European Commission said it was time to reach agreement on a
new regime which prohibited state subsidies, eliminated tariff and
non-tariff barriers, and included a 'disputes mechanism'.
Officials suggested the US had been delaying support for an MSA agreement
until the outcome of the ITC case.
In 1991, EC steelmakers exported about 4m tonnes to the US. The US Commerce
Department imposed preliminary countervailing duties on about 1.9m tonnes
earlier this year; the ITC ruling reduces the total subject to duties by 50
per cent.
The EC officials said a key factor was that the ITC ruling removed many
prohibitive duties, making an improvement in US market access more likely.
Thus, German exports of corrosion-resistant steel remained subject to
duties, but only at a level of about 5 per cent which was not necessarily a
deterrent to selling in the US.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, and the German Steel
Federation yesterday joined forces to denounce the ITC's ruling as
discriminatory.
The ruling would impose anti-dumping duties of between 5.47 and 50.17 per
cent on corrosion-resistant products, cut-to length plates and cold rolled
plates, Mr Rexrodt said. Officials at the economics ministry said it was
felt the ruling affected German companies more severely than steelmakers in
other countries.
France gave a qualified welcome to the decision, with Mr Gerard Longuet,
minister for industry, post and telecommunications, saying it represented a
'three-quarters victory' in an issue which had 'poisoned relations between
the US and the EC'.
To the extent that a 'disastrous' outcome had been avoided, the ruling would
have a positive effect on the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in Geneva,
he added.
However, Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel producer, protested
against the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties upheld on
corrosion-resistant products. Canadian steelmakers backed the ruling.
They will be refunded several hundred million dollars from provisional
duties but await ITC confirmation of a 28 per cent tariff on galvanised
steel exports and 68.7 per cent on heavy plate exports.

FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland injects new urgency into Gatt
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter
Sutherland, called yesterday for greater urgency in negotiations on
concluding the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks by December 15.
Addressing the top-level trade negotiations committee, he said the work done
in the past two weeks on opening markets for goods and services had been
useful. But he urged countries to come forward quickly with more
concessions. Mr Sutherland later told reporters: 'On balance I am more
optimistic (than two weeks ago) but there are serious risks to the Round.'
The global trade talks in Geneva restarted earlier this month after the US,
the EC, Japan and Canada agreed a deal to reduce or eliminate tariffs on 18
categories of goods. However, the latest talks have underscored the gaps in
that accord and the problems caused by interlinking different elements of
the package.
Many developing countries complained yesterday that the principle of more
favourable treatment for poorer nations was being disregarded, and made
clear that market access concessions from them on goods and services would
depend on offers from industrialised nations on commodities, agricultural
goods and textiles.
A number of countries, both rich and poor, are also tying tariff cuts and
market-opening measures for services to changes in the Uruguay Round draft
rules package, especially on agriculture and textiles.
Mr Sutherland called on countries to break the logjam by making conditional
offers, and said he would be holding consultations on how best to uphold the
objective of more favourable treatment for developing nations. Warning of
the 'vast amount' of work needed before the rules could be finalised, he
urged countries 'to exercise maximum self-restraint' in proposing changes to
the draft text, drawn up in December 1991.
The TNC has agreed a tight negotiating schedule in its drive to achieve
'substantial and concrete progress' in the market access talks by
mid-October. The negotiating group on goods will meet on October 15 for
'stocktaking', aimed at completing detailed draft tariff schedules a month
later.
Revised services offers have been requested by September 1, paving the way
for intensive negotiations on liberalisation commitments.
Mr Sutherland plans immediate consultations on technical aspects of the
rules package, including dispute settlement and the proposed Multilateral
Trade Organisation.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Israel fears it may have dealt Syria a joker in peace talks:
Syrian 'restraint' and doubts over the success of Israeli objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISKS of Israel's devastating aerial and artillery bombardment of
southern Lebanon were becoming apparent yesterday as international criticism
intensified and the Middle East peace process came under growing threat,
while there was as yet no sign the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas had been
neutralised.
Both President Bill Clinton and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary
general, were severe in their criticism of Israel's action yesterday. There
was also a feeling in Israel that after Mr Clinton's praise of Syrian
'restraint', President Hafez al-Assad's hand at future peace talks had been
strengthened at Israel's expense.
Some Israelis fear that as a reward for that 'restraint', Syria will
persuade the US to increase pressure on Israel to make a commitment to
withdraw from the Golan Heights, which it seized in 1967.
Meanwhile, the shift of the bombardment to the western and central sectors
of southern Lebanon yesterday further revealed the overt and covert
objectives of the offensive.
The first, confirmed in parliament yesterday by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister, is to drive southern Lebanese villagers northwards to put pressure
on the governments of Lebanon and Syria to end the Hizbollah problem by
denying the guerrillas arms supplies and financial assistance, which comes
mainly from Iran.
Hizbollah is the only Lebanese militia that has been allowed to retain heavy
weapons, on the basis that it is fighting a war of national liberation by
seeking to push Israel out of the south of the country.
The second, undeclared, Israeli objective appears to be to extend the area
of Lebanon it controls without having to commit ground troops, a move that
would be unpopular with the Israeli public.
As villagers headed out of south Lebanon, military officials said privately
that a broad strip of land, 3 to 6 miles north of the self-styled 'security
zone', would become, at least in the short term, a no-man's land and a
second buffer zone where Israel could strike easily in the future. This
would put Hizbollah's 122m Katyusha rockets, which have a maximum range of
17 miles, out of reach of settlements in northern Israel.
However, Hizbollah shows little signs of letting up in its harassment of
Israel, and if Syria, which allows Iranian supplies to reach Hizbollah, does
not move to curb the guerrillas, Israel could again be stuck in a war of
attrition.
Even senior Israeli government officials admit that, far from pin-pointing
Syria as responsible for the upsurge in conflict, the Israeli offensive may
play into the hands of Damascus. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said
Syria wanted to be the one seen as solving the crisis 'to gain points with
the Americans and to increase US pressure on Israel in the peace talks'.
Mr David Levy, a senior Likud MP and former foreign minister, said
yesterday: 'Syria is now considered the moderate party. We failed here. . .
We shouldn't help turn Syria into the key for a solution to whom we'll have
to beg and to whom we'll have to pay a price.'
Hitherto the offensive has been widely popular inside Israel, although
opposition is growing within Mr Rabin's coalition. The blitz has also
furthered Mr Rabin's policy of undermining the right-wing Likud, which
prides itself on toughness.
Much will depend on how Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state,
approaches the problems when he arrives in the region on Sunday and whether
he can turn the crisis into an opportunity.

   NABATIYEH, SOUTHERN LEBANON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE population of Nabatiyeh was roughly 60,000 last Saturday, making it one
of the biggest towns in south Lebanon. Yesterday, it was anyone's guess how
many people were still living behind the shuttered shop-fronts and closed
doors. Some of the few people visible guessed that no more than 10,000
remained.
From the roof-top of Nabatiyeh's tallest building, only a handful of people
could be spotted either in the streets or peering anxiously from windows.
A few cars raced through the deserted roads, swerving to avoid debris or
treetop branches sliced by incoming shells. Every 15 seconds, after a thump
audible from Israeli positions overlooking the town, and the chilling hiss
of an incoming shell, another house would disappear behind a piercing crack
and a cloud of dark smoke.
On the ground floor of the same building, a modern shopping and office
block, the shutters of only one store remained open - Akil Brothers'
children's clothes. Inside, on mattresses strewn among rails of bright
children's T-shirts, 25 men, women and children were huddled, terrified to
move.
'There's nothing here, no food, no petrol,' said Abdel Jalil, a student.
'There is only one shop but it has food for maybe one day.' Mr Jalil said he
and the others were too afraid to travel along the road out of Nabatiyeh to
safety and, anyway, had neither vehicles nor anyone to stay with in Beirut.
'We'll just stay here,' he said with a shrug.
Others in the 70 villages around Nabatiyeh and Tyre, where Israeli jets and
gunners concentrated their attacks yesterday did, however, continue south
Lebanon's exodus - bringing to perhaps 200,000 the number of refugees to
have descended on Beirut since Monday. More will have taken advantage of
Israel's short ceasefire late yesterday to leave.
But for civilians with no way out the dangers will only increase. Not only
is there scant food or water but any visible movement inside or outside
their houses is likely to attract the attention of Israeli artillery
spotters, who in yesterday's raids were pounding shells repeatedly and
devastatingly into selected houses.
Israel has made it clear that those who do not heed warnings to leave
certain villages, broadcast every 15 minutes on South Lebanon Radio, will
suffer the consequences.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said it was trying to run relief
agencies into the worst hit villages to rescue the marooned.
But some villages are now hard or impossible to reach. The main road south
from Nabatiyeh, an artery for 25 nearby villages, was deserted yesterday for
fear of shelling. The road to Jibsheet, five kilometres from Nabatiyeh, was
severed completely by a five-foot-deep crater.
For the thousands arriving in Beirut without friends or family to receive
them, the Lebanese government has so far been able to offer little more than
space. Schools and public buildings have been opened to the refugees. But
these yesterday were often poorly equipped to cope.
Yesterday, and for the first time in a long time, this anger poured on to
Beirut's tattered streets. Thousands of Hizbollah supporters marched in a
sour and noisy demonstration through the city's centre chanting 'Death to
Israel and America,' 'No to peace with Israel.'
South Lebanon's problems are now also those of Beirut.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Bosnia deal on partition edges closer

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia yesterday appeared to have succumbed
to intense international pressure, when he began discussing with his Serb
and Croat rivals the proposed partition of the republic along ethnic lines.
A Bosnian diplomat confirmed that the Bosnian delegation discussed maps and
the possible formation of a confederation. It was also revealed that western
experts had met Bosnian leaders to discuss the establishment of national
currencies and financial institutions.
Until yesterday, Mr Izetbegovic has consistenly rejected the republic's
partition.
After last night's negotiating session in Geneva, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia said: 'We are approaching a solution on vital issues.'
Talks are due to continue today.
However, the Bosnian delegation earlier spoke bitterly of betrayal by the
international community. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign minister, said he
was 'pessimistic' about the prospects for a settlement.
Serb leaders seemed increasingly convinced they had achieved their aims. Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, warned Moslems of their stark
choice in ending the war. 'One way would be through talks, the other would
be total defeat of one side - and it would be the Moslem side,' he said.
The Geneva talks represent the first time the main protagonists in the
Bosnian conflict have held face-to-face negotiations for six months,
although they held a meeting without dialogue in Athens in May.
Yesterday's talks focused on maps outlining the future borders of the three
ethnic mini-states rather than on a constitutional framework, according to
diplomats.
The meeting between the faction leaders took place in a room dominated by a
huge map of Bosnia suspended on an easel. Mr Karadzic is said to have
offered 26 per cent of Bosnia's territory to the Moslems, the largest ethnic
group at 44 per cent of the pre-war population of 4.35m.
Mr Izetbegovic remains opposed to the plan to divide his republic, on the
grounds that it will lead to annexation of most of Bosnia by neighbouring
Serbia and Croatia.
Diplomats said Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the special US envoy, was trying to
persuade Mr Izetbegovic to accept a partition, while his Russian
counterpart, Mr Vitaly Churkin, was asking the Serbs to make concessions to
the Moslems.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg last night left the warring leaders on their
own behind closed doors to discuss the proposed maps.

A decision on the use of Nato airpower to protect UN troops in Bosnia will

'I hope everything will be ready on Monday or Tuesday,' he said. Forward air
controllers must first be in place to guide the attack aircraft. Britain,
France and the Netherlands have promised to deploy the controllers and the
first of the British contingent was said yesterday to be 'in theatre'.
Procedures for invoking the Security Council's resolution on possible air
strikes against the Serbs had still not been worked out, Mr Boutros Ghali
said. Peackeeping staff yesterday discussed the Islamic Conference

JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party is on the verge of losing power after seven
opposition parties yesterday agreed to support a joint prime ministerial
candidate and form a coalition government.
Two parties holding the balance of power, the Japan New party and the New
Harbinger party, said yesterday they had no intention of backing the LDP,
which needs their votes during a parliamentary session to appoint a new
prime minister next week.
If the seven opposition parties do not falter in the next few days, the LDP
will lose office for the first time since 1955, though the new coalition is
comprised mostly of conservative parties unlikely to want sudden changes in
economic and foreign policy.
The ideological exception in the seven is the Social Democratic party,
formerly the Japan Socialist party, which wants the disbanding of the
Japanese military, takes a tougher foreign policy line against the US, and
supports totalitarian North Korea in preference to South Korea.
But the seven parties have been able to form a coalition by agreeing not to
talk about the SDP's more controversial policies and concentrating their
discussion on overhauling the scandal-tainted political system and toppling
the LDP, which is continuing to lose members.
Three MPs left yesterday and further resignations are likely in the next
week, with most defectors planning to join the Japan Renewal party, run by
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former LDP faction head who brought down the government
of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa and forced a general election on July 18.
Apart from the JRP, the SDP, the JNP, and NHP, the coalition includes the
Komeito, backed by the a Buddhist movement, the Democratic Socialist party,
and the United Social Democratic party. The seven parties concede that their
planned partnership could be short-lived and that another general election
is possible within a few months.
Two candidates formally applied yesterday to replace Mr Miyazawa in the LDP
presidency, to be decided at a party meeting tomorrow. Mr Michio Watanabe,
70, the former foreign minister, is competing, although he is in poor
health, while Mr Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, was asked by party
elders to stand.
Mr Kono, 56, hopes that his candidacy will tempt one of the coalition
members to join the LDP in government. His claims to being a reformer are
based on his own defection from the LDP in the 1970s to form a breakaway
group, which was later reunited with the party.
In the past, selection as LDP president has also carried the title of prime
minister, but the successful candidate must face a challenge in parliament
next week from the coalition's candidate for the leadership. The LDP is
certain of receiving 224 votes, while a stable coalition can count on 245
votes.
It is still unclear who will represent the coalition, though Mr Hata is
favourite, followed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the JNP leader. Both rate well
in public opinion polls and other coalition parties have indicated that
either will be acceptable.
If the coalition does crumble in the next few days, the most likely causes
would be a split in the SDP or successful overtures by the LDP to one
coalition member. However, the likelihood of a coalition government has
increased following the rejection of the LDP's vague political reform
proposals by the JNP and NHP.

FT  29 JUL 93 / France unveils plans to spend 'Balladur bond'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday unveiled plans to use the FF70bn (Pounds
7.9bn) windfall from its successful 'Balladur bond' issue to provide funds
for business and to invest in regional schools and colleges.
The bond, designed to bridge the gap between current public expenditure and
future revenues from the government's privatisation programme, raised about
FFr110bn, almost three times the original target when the offer closed
earlier this month.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, said that the government had
decided to use FFr35bn, half the surplus, to eliminate a one-month delay in
the repayment of value added tax refunds to companies. This will represent a
substantial boost to corporate cashflow without increasing the government's
budget deficit, which is forecast to reach about FFr317bn this year.
The move is intended to ease companies' short-term financial pressures due
to the French recession. Mr Sarkozy said that 97 per cent of French
companies owed VAT refunds - about 2.4m companies - would be repaid in full
this year.
According to Mr Sarkozy, a further FFr20bn of the bond surplus would be used
to fund a jobs and investment package early next year. These funds will be
incorporated in the government's 1994 budget plan, due to be completed in
September. As with the FFr40bn initially budgeted in the Balladur bond,
these funds are expected to be used for public works and construction
projects.
In the meantime the government plans to use FFr8bn of the surplus to provide
subsidised loans to local government for the renovation of schools and
colleges. The education ministry said this initiative was also intended to
help create jobs in the construction industry. Security measures will also
be improved in French schools.
Local authorities will also receive an additional FFr7bn for youth training
schemes. The French right was fiercely critical of the Socialist
government's youth training programmes, but has expanded the schemes since
taking power in the March elections.
The government also said it will raise 'return to school' payments to help
low-income families.

TWO Hyundai companies threatened to lock out workers unless their unions
reduced their pay demands as South Korea's biggest conglomerate enters its
55th day of industrial action today, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The government also dispatched more riot police to Ulsan, the south-eastern
city that is the main manufacturing base of Hyundai, in possible preparation
to end the strikes affecting six Hyundai companies.
Meanwhile, workers at Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, the first Hyundai
company to stage industrial action in early June, voted to approve a wage
settlement by a wide margin.
The two companies threatened with lock-outs are Hyundai Heavy Industries,
the shipbuilding unit and the biggest group subsidiary on strike, and
Hyundai Construction Equipment. Hyundai Wood Industries became the first
Hyundai company to face a lock-out on Tuesday.
Workers at the Hyundai companies are seeking pay raises higher than that
offered by management and the reinstatement of fired union leaders at
several plants.
Other companies on strike are Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and Korea Flange, which
rejected proposed pay pacts on Tuesday, and Hyundai Electrical Engineering.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE integrity of Hong Kong's legal profession has been cast into doubt after
nine of the colony's leading firms of solicitors declined to represent two
elected Hong Kong politicians in a libel action.
Mr Martin Lee and Mr Szeto Wah, the two senior members of the United
Democrats, a pro-democracy party, claim that Mr Simon Li, a former Appeal
Court judge, defamed them recently when he alleged they promoted a run on
mainland Chinese banks in response to the suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing in mid-1989.
Ten days ago the two politicians said they would sue Mr Li for his remarks
which they said were false. Mr Li is an 'adviser' to Beijing on Hong Kong
affairs and was recently appointed to a high-level Sino-Hong Kong committee.
Most of the firms have cited conflict of interest in declining to represent
the two politicians because Mr Li sits on the board of a company for which
they act. Some of the firms themselves have threatened legal action if their
identities are disclosed.

could reach Japan, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Mr Woolsey told a congressional hearing that the missile, with a range of
about 600 miles, was capable of carrying nuclear, chemical or biological
payloads.
'With this missile North Korea could reach Japan; Iran could reach Israel;
and Libya could reach US bases and allied capitals in the Mediterranean

It said 42 companies in the city had issued stock certificates without
approval from regulatory authorities and a lively secondary market had
developed.
'It gave rise to a spontaneous market for trading shares, which in a way
affected the normal progress in the experiment (of opening stock markets),'
the agency said. The authorities have registered all the outstanding shares
and ordered the companies that issued them to turn them into non-tradable
and non-negotiable 'stock right holding cards.' After the move, speculators
in the free market began to disappear, the agency said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINORITY government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister,
yesterday survived a parliamentary motion of no confidence by a narrow
margin of 14 votes, after days of intense political horse-trading.
The motion, brought by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Monday, was
supported by the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata party, the National Front
and Left Front parties. It was defeated by 265 votes to 251.
The opposition parties alleged that the Rao government had failed because of
its 'involvement' in the Bombay financial scandal, its inability to stop
last December's destruction of a mosque at Ayodhya and the violence that
followed, and failure on the economic front with a liberalisation programme
which, they said, would leave the country's poor worse off.
A confident Mr Rao told parliament that he saw no difference from the two
previous motions he had defeated in the last 25 months, and that identifying
charges against him was 'like looking for a few needles in a haystack.'
Mr Rao attacked the Communists for deriding his liberalisation programme
when it asked for help in industrialising West Bengal, the one state where
there was a left-wing government. He said Indian economic reforms had a
'human face' which had not allowed thousands to lose their jobs, as they had
in other countries.
'The ill effects of liberalisation have been forestalled,' he said.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said that the economic situation
had considerably improved in the past two years, and that two years were too
short a time to judge his reforms package.
Mr Rao announced that his government would introduce bills this session to
de-link religion from politics, and to initiate electoral reforms. He made
no mention of the charges of corruption against him and his party, or the
Bombay financial scandal, but talked instead of how the ruling Congress
party was committed to solving the problems of farmers and handloom weavers.
The Communists said last night that though the Congress government had
scraped through, it had 'suffered a political and moral defeat by managing
to cling on by resorting to a shameless use of money power and
horse-trading.'
The Opposition alleged that the ruling party had bought at least seven MPs
of the Janata Dal faction headed by Mr Ajit Singh, which announced only on
Tuesday that they would support the motion.
Chaos prevailed on the floor of the House as one of the MPs was charged by
his colleagues of entering the house drunk, and another Congress (I) MP, who
had been hurt last week when police quelled a violent demonstration in
Calcutta, was brought in on a wheelchair.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Efim deal takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC Commission has reached preliminary agreement with Italy that paves
the way for the Italian government to begin disbursing L7,000bn (Pounds
2.9bn) of funds earmarked for creditors of Efim, the state industrial
holding.
The agreement came too close to the summer recess for the full details to be
worked out. This means the Italian government is unlikely to be able to
begin consider disbursements to banks and suppliers before late September.
The deal has been struck at a 'political' level by Mr Beniamino Andreatta,
the Italian foreign minister, with Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC commissioner
in charge of competition. Although neither side will admit as much, the
agreement is part of a trade-off in Italy's acrimonious dispute with
Brussels over state subsidies - and particularly those for Ilva, the
loss-making state steel group.
On Tuesday, Mr Andreatta softened Italy's stance over Ilva and agreed to
withdraw plans to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) incurred by the steel group.
The Italians have made no secret of their view that Brussels has been
blocking an Efim agreement to exert pressure in the Ilva affair.
Italy now has until August 14 to present fresh proposals for Ilva's future,
which will be studied in late September. Until the EC is satisfied with the
Ilva plan, it could go slow on formalising an agreement on Efim.
Efim was placed in liquidation last July with L18,000bn worth of debts split
roughly equally between banks and suppliers. Foreign banks are owed over
L3,500bn.
The Italian parliament approved disbursement of L9,000bn over three months
to Efim creditors; but since then Brussels has only given the go-ahead for
L2,000bn to the defence side of the state holding.
Mr Van Miert blocked the funds on the grounds that repayment of Efim's
accumulated debts represented a form of subsidy. The Italian government
argued that it was legally bound to honour Efim debts which amounted to
sovereign debt.
The outline agreement envisages the Italian government being able to honour
Efim debt accumulated at the time of liquidation, plus subsequent interest
and refinancing arrangements. The government will be placing L4,000bn in the
1994 budget to cover the further cost of the liquidation.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Milk quota penalties

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday agreed to claw back Ecu2.3bn (Pounds
1.73bn) in unnecessary subsidies to Italy, Greece and Spain which
systematically failed to enforce milk production quotas in the 1980s, writes
Lionel Barber.
The penalties, although severe, fall short of the original Ecu5.38bn in
excess spending incurred by the EC between 1984 and 1992.
The reduced penalty was settled upon because the three states have pledged
to respect new rules to curb overproduction, and partly because the EC is
offering an extra Ecu240m of special assistance to Italy and Spain to remove
2m tonnes of excess milk capacity.
Both Italy and Spain face net payments this year of Ecu100m and Ecu50m only.
However, Italy faces a total bill of Ecu1.345bn - which it will 'pay'
through a reduction in EC subsidies. The EC will recover Ecu960m from Spain,
but only Ecu5m from Greece.

FT  29 JUL 93 / EC backs de Larosiere for EBRD: Italy and Denmark withdraw
their candidates at last minute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12-nation European Community reached a last-minute consensus last night
to propose Mr Jacques de Larosiere of France as the EC candidate for the
presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The agreement, announced in a letter to EC leaders by Mr Phillipe Maystadt,
the Belgian minister of finance, came at the end of an extra week of
protracted negotiations between EC members in which the EBRD candidacy was
part of wider horse-trading over the siting of the future European central
bank.
At the last moment Italy and Denmark withdrew their candidates - Mr Giuliano
Amato, the former Italian prime minister, and Mr Henning Christophersen, the
Danish EC commissioner - although the Italian decision in particular is
believed to have been fiercely contested by politicians in Rome angry at
French domination of key international financial institutions.
The nomination of Mr de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France and a
former managing director of the IMF, does not mean he will automatically
become the next president of the EBRD in succession to the disgraced former
president, Mr Jacques Attali. The final choice will depend on the outcome of
the complex two-tier voting system in which the G7 countries have a weighted
vote proportional to their shareholdings, while the 57 governors of the
bank, representing shareholder governments from both east and west, have one
vote each plus an additional two votes wielded by the EC and the European
Investment Bank.
Neither the US, which is entitled to 10 per cent of the votes as the largest
single shareholder, nor Japan, another G7 member with an 8.5 per cent voting
share, have formally stated their preference. But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US
Treasury secretary, hinted strongly at an OECD meeting earlier this month
that the US would vote with the EC.
The EC consensus practically eliminates the possibility that the fourth
candidate, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, could
be chosen to lead the bank which was set up two years ago to foster
investment in the former communist states of east Europe.
Day-to-day running of the bank over the last few months has been largely in
the hands of Mr Ron Freeman, the American who heads the merchant banking
division of the EBRD. He is expected to continue as the effective chief
executive of the bank under de Larosiere.

General Motors in Detroit yesterday maintained a silence over the latest

It was left to Opel, General Motors' German manufacturing subsidiary, to
rebuff comments made by Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, that GM could
have planted confidential documents found at a flat in Wiesbaden formerly
occupied by a GM manager.
'The accusations and allegations by Mr Piech are on an amazingly low level,'
Opel said in a statement, rejecting all of them as 'without any substance'.
The company added: 'The statements made by Mr Piech are in sharp contrast to
the well-advanced investigation results by the Darmstadt public prosecutor's
office.'

FT  29 JUL 93 / Commission in retreat on mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday bowed to opposition from the UK, Germany
and France and staged a tactical retreat in its campaign to expand its
powers to vet large mergers.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian Commissioner responsible for competition
policy, said he hoped member states would reconsider their opposition to
lowering thresholds above which the Commission investigates deals affecting
the EC.
Mr Van Miert said business was generally in favour of the Commission
proposals but governments and national competition authorities had resisted
because of fears of transferring power to Brussels.
At present, Brussels looks at all mergers involving companies with a
combined world turnover of Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.77bn) . The Commission
originally wanted to a reduce this threshold to Ecu2bn. It also wanted to
lower the threshold on combined sales within the EC from Ecu250m to Ecu100m.
If the Commission had won support for lowering the thresholds, the Merger
Task Force's workload would have doubled to around 110 cases a year. Mr Van
Miert made clear, however, that he did not wish to introduce uncertainty by
forcing the issue - a reference to the 17 years it took for member states to
agree to EC merger regulations.
The Commission now intends to take further measures to promote greater
transparency and efficiency in its rules. It would like to publicise
commitments made by parties to remedy clear-cut competition problems after
the initial one-month vetting period. Subject to business confidentiality,
it would like to introduce prior publication to commitments offered by
parties in so-called Phase Two cases.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS FYODOROV, the Russian deputy prime minister and finance minister,
yesterday vowed to fight to annul the central bank's 'useless and
unjustified' decision to withdraw all pre-1993 roubles. He demanded the
resignation of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman.
In an uncompromising tone, Mr Fyodorov repeated several times that 'there is
one person who is guilty: that is Victor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko; his
actions are senseless, even I would say stupid. Not one economist or one
banker in the whole civilised world would take a decision like this'. He
said western officials were 'extremely concerned' about the central bank's
action.
'Only two weeks after we returned from the Tokyo summit (at which Dollars
44bn foreign aid was pledged to Russia's reform) this decision is taken.
This again tells the whole world that we are an untrust-
worthy partner. There were calls to suspend aid to Russia,' he said, hours
after returning from Washington where he had talks with US officials and
financial institutions.
Earlier yesterday the praesidium of the Russian parliament declared it was
cancelling the bank's decision. It said all limits for changing old money
into new had been scrapped and that all trading outlets had to accept
pre-1993 banknotes. However, Mr Fyodorov yesterday dismissed the
parliament's announcement, saying that the president must abolish the bank's
initial decision.
On Monday, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, moderated the bank's
announcement by raising the limit of notes to be changed from Rbs35,000 to
Rbs100,000 and extending the time within which old roubles could be
exchanged.
In a separate decision, the praesidium also cancelled Mr Yeltsin's decree
sacking Mr Viktor Barannikov, the security minister, fired for corruption
and failure to react promptly to attacks on his border guards on the
Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. The parliament said the dismissal 'violated
legal norms'.
Mr Fyodorov admitted he had no way of exercising leverage on Mr Gerashchenko
or the bank itself since it was constitutionally under the control of
parliament. The finance minister said that Mr Yeltsin had not been told of
the bank's move in advance.
Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
yesterday was reported as calling for a strong protest to be lodged by the
Group of Seven industrial countries.
His suggestion, however, was vetoed by the G7 foreign ministers, including
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, who felt it would be
counter-productive.
The International Monetary Fund also issued an unusually public criticism of
the recall, and of the Russian central bank's failure to notify the Fund in
advance.
'The lack of consultation with the IMF at a time when the IMF is supporting
a stabilisation and reform programme in Russia with resources under its
systemic transformation facility is regrettable,' an official said.

<TEXT>
FOUR managers from Thyssen Sonnenberg, the much vaunted recycling subsidiary
of the Thyssen group, were yesterday arrested on suspicion of exporting
toxic waste to France.
The four men, who include Mr Gunther Giffels, chairman of the board of
management at the Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, will be held in custody until
a legal hearing due today, the prosecutor's office in the state of Hesse
said.
The arrests are likely to cause considerable worry among German recycling
companies which fear recurring and cumbersome examinations from public
authorities.
German authorities, at federal and state levels, are anxious to improve
their country's image following scandals involving export of toxic waste.
The Frankfurt-based prosecutor's office, which is currently investigating 40
companies for possible violations of Germany's strict environmental laws, is
accusing Thyssen Sonnenberg of dumping toxic waste in France by exporting it
to a front company on the Franco-German border.
Thyssen Sonnenberg denounced the arrests, calling the prosecutor's
suspicions 'unfounded'. It said both German and French authorities had given
permission, renewed until May 1994, to export waste to its French
subsidiary, Lormet, in Pagny sur Meuse.
But the prosecutor's office yesterday said: 'We have reasons to believe that
Thyssen Sonnenberg mixed toxic waste with normal waste in order to export
it. It then could tell German authorities that it was going to recycle the
waste in its French subsidiary at lower costs.' The subsidiary was bought a
year ago, by Thyssen Sonnenberg and another German recycler called Eumet,
the prosecutor's office said.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Heavy penalties imposed over milk quota failures
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday agreed to claw back Ecu2.3bn (Pounds
1.73bn) in unnecessary subsidies to Italy, Greece and Spain which
systematically failed to enforce milk production quotas in the 1980s.
The penalties are among the most severe in recent memory, although they fall
short of the original Ecu5.38bn in excess spending incurred by the EC
between 1984 and 1992.
The reduced penalty was settled upon because the three member states have
pledged to respect new rules to curb overproduction, and partly because the
EC is offering an extra Ecu240m of special assistance to Italy and Spain to
remove 2m tonnes of excess milk capacity.
Both Italy and Spain face net payments this year of Ecu100m and Ecu50m only.
However, Italy faces a total bill of Ecu1.345bn - which it will 'pay'
through a reduction in EC subsidies. The EC will recover Ecu960m from Spain,
but only Ecu5m from Greece.
EC officials said the penalty levied against Italy was the toughest in more
than 20 years. It underlined the determination of Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm
commissioner, to make the new milk quota reforms work.
A Brussels spokesman stressed that the one-year increase in the Italian milk
quota of 900,000 tonnes was only provisional and would be withdrawn if the
Rome government failed to respect the rules. The same applied to Spain's
increase of 500,000 tonnes and Greece's extra quota of 100,000 tonnes.
As late as 1991, neither Italy, Spain nor Greece had a system in place to
supervise milk production or to collect the levy, according to a report by
the EC's Court of Auditors. The Commission continued to pay full subsidies
even though failure to collect the additional levy should have disqualified
the three countries from obtaining matching levels of spending.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Italian security chief quits: Old-guard politicians, Mafia

Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE head of Italy's domestic intelligence service resigned yesterday as
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
talked of a 'criminal design' to destabilise Italy at a delicate moment of
political transition.
They called for calm in a nation last week rocked by the suicides of two
prominent figures involved in the corruption scandals.
The resignation of Mr Angelo Finocchiaro, head of the Sisde intelligence
agency, followed three car bomb explosions in Rome and Milan on Tuesday
night. Five people were killed.
It was not clear whether Mr Finocchiaro's resignation was forced by the
Ciampi government. But there has been strong criticism by politicians of the
lax control of Italy's security services, and their apparent failure to
control terrorism that has killed 10 people in the past two months.
Although the precise responsibility for the car bombs remains a mystery,
officials said yesterday they had been planned deliberately. The bombs
exploded as political parties are about to approve electoral laws that will
usher in a largely new political class and at a crucial stage in the
investigations into political corruption: leading politicians of the past
decade are expected soon to be linked to enormous sums of illicit money.
In response to the latest outrage, Italy's trade unions held two-hour
stoppages in Rome and Milan yesterday, accompanied by large demonstrations.
Pope John Paul II made a point of inspecting the damage at the sites of the
two car bombs in Rome - the basilica of St John Lateran and the 12th century
church of St George, Velabro.
As with the two earlier bomb outrages at Florence's Uffizi Gallery and in a
wealthy residential area of Rome in May, the authorities were unable to give
clear indications of those responsible. No arrests have been made in the two
months since these bombskilled five people in Florence and damaged part of
the world-famous picture gallery as well as injuring 23 in Rome.
Mr Nicola Mancini, the interior minister, pointed the finger at organised
crime. He said there were similarities between Tuesday's bombs and the car
bomb that assassinated Mr Paolo Borsellino, the anti-Mafia judge, in Palermo
last July, as well as the bombing of the Naples-Milan train in 1984 that
killed 15 people.
The Borsellino killing was the work of the Sicilian Mafia, while the
Naples-Milan train bombing was blamed on a mix of organised crime,
right-wing extremists and elements within the security forces. Uncontrolled
elements in the security services along with the Mafia, backed by some of
the old-guard politicians, are now being accused of orchestrating the car
bombs.
In the wake of the Uffizi car bombing on May 27, the Ciampi government
carried out four changes in the senior hierarchy of the security services.
Pressure for a major clean-up of the Sisde has increased in recent weeks
following the discovery that a number of top officials, past and present,
had expropriated L14bn (Pounds 5.8m) of its funds and had been running a
travel agency on the side.
The car bombs all exploded during the late evening/early morning. Yesterday,
the authorities played down earlier suggestions that firemen had been lured
to a burning car in Milan with the bomb then being exploded. Two car bombs
were placed beside two ancient religous buildings in Rome - St John Lateran,
which once housed the Popes and was where Mussolini signed the 1929 pact
with the Church. All three bombs were directed against Italy's
cultural/artistic heritage, the Milan explosion being outside the
Contemporary Art Museum. The portico of St George, Velabro, was destroyed
after recently being restored at a cost of L300m.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday announced proposals to strengthen the
powers of banking supervisory authorities in the EC in the wake of the Bank
of Credit and Commerce International scandal.
The proposals call for tightened supervision of all financial institutions,
ranging from banks, credit institutions, and insurance businesses, to ensure
that their operations are transparent - a quality which was absent in the
case of BCCI, making it more difficult for the supervisory authorities to
intervene.
The Commission said that although the basic approach of its second banking
directive, investment services directive, and third-generation insurance
directive was sound, new provisions were needed to strengthen the
supervisors' powers to monitor the institutions under their remit.
The Commission also proposed:
A new requirement whereby the financial institutions must maintain their
head offices in the same member state as the registered office. A widening
of the list of bodies with whom confidential supervisory information can be
exchanged by the authorities.
Obliging auditors to report to the authorities any irregularities which
might harm customers, the financial system or the undertaking itself.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Brussels plans crackdown on industrial piracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday proposed wide-ranging measures to protect
industrial designs in order to prevent trade piracy and to strengthen the
single market.
The new rules, which must be approved by the Council of Ministers and
European Parliament, cover electronics, furniture, fashion and the
controversial market in industrial spare parts.
The Commission proposals are linked to an expanding Brussels effort to
harmonise national rules covering trademarks, copyright, and intellectual
property, supported when necessary by Community-wide legislation.
The Commission said new legislation was necessary because national laws on
design protection varied widely. It said: 'Superior design is an important
instrument for European industries in their competition with industries from
third countries having lower production costs.'
Under the new initiative, member states will be asked to support a new
Community Design Office which will offer protection throughout the EC.
National design rights will not be abolished, but the goal is that the EC
design will gradually supersede them.
The Commission proposed that industrial designs with an 'individual
character' will be eligible for EC-wide protection from counterfeiters for
five years, renewable up to a maximum of 25 years.
Industries such as fashion which produce large numbers of designs with a
short shelf life can apply for a weaker form of protection called
Unregistered Community Design. This would apply for a maximum of three
years, and would exist once the design was made available to the public.
The Commission took a more controversial decision on the level of protection
to be offered to spare parts for cars. Under the Brussels proposal, spare
parts would receive only three years' protection from the date a model comes
on to the market.
The decision represents a victory for commissioners such as Sir Leon Brittan
who argued that greater protection would restrict competition and raise
costs to consumers; but it is a setback for large car companies such as Fiat
and VW which wanted broader protection for items such as bonnets or bumpers
whose design is dictated by the car's overall appearance.
Commission officials hope to introduce legislation within the next two
years. The initiative follows extensive consultations.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Efim deal takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>

   ROME, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC Commission has reached preliminary agreement with Italy that paves
the way for the Italian government to begin disbursing L7,000bn (Pounds
2.9bn) of funds earmarked for creditors of Efim, the state industrial
holding.
The agreement came too close to the summer recess for the full details to be
worked out. This means the Italian government is unlikely to be able to
begin consider disbursements to banks and suppliers before late September.
The deal has been struck at a 'political' level by Mr Beniamino Andreatta,
the Italian foreign minister, with Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC commissioner
in charge of competition. Although neither side will admit as much, the
agreement is part of a trade-off in Italy's acrimonious dispute with
Brussels over state subsidies - and particularly those for Ilva, the
loss-making state steel group.
On Tuesday, Mr Andreatta softened Italy's stance over Ilva and agreed to
withdraw plans to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) incurred by the steel group.
The Italians have made no secret of their view that Brussels has been
blocking an Efim agreement to exert pressure in the Ilva affair.
Italy now has until August 14 to present fresh proposals for Ilva's future,
which will be studied in late September. Until the EC is satisfied with the
Ilva plan, it could go slow on formalising an agreement on Efim.
Efim was placed in liquidation last July with L18,000bn worth of debts split
roughly equally between banks and suppliers.
Foreign banks are owed over L3,500bn.
The Italian parliament approved disbursement of L9,000bn over three months
to Efim creditors; but since then Brussels has only given the go-ahead for
L2,000bn to the defence side of the state holding.
Mr Van Miert blocked the funds on the grounds that repayment of Efim's
accumulated debts represented a form of subsidy. The Italian government
argued that it was legally bound to honour Efim debts which amounted to
sovereign debt.
The outline agreement envisages the Italian government being able to honour
Efim debt accumulated at the time of liquidation, plus subsequent interest
and refinancing arrangements. The government will be placing some L4,000bn
in the 1994 budget to cover the further cost of the liquidation which could
eventually reach a total of L17,000bn.
In return, Italy has undertaken to provide a clear timetable of
privatisation plans and the precise levels of the debt of state companies.
The latter's debt at the end of December 1993 will be considered their
maximum ceiling. Thereafter the Italian government must be seen to be
reducing the levels of debt.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Piech hurls some of his own mud: Christopher Parkes goes to
Wolfsburg to hear VW chief answer GM and prosecutors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR FERDINAND Piech, Volkswagen chairman, yesterday established that he is
quite adept himself with the weapon he accuses General Motors of using
against him - mud.
Having summoned reporters to 'Alaska', (his pet name for VW's northern home
town, Wolfsburg, in the days when he was head of Audi in Bavaria), he was in
a mood to practise his marksmanship.
There was one in the eye for the press and a couple for the public
prosecutors investigating suspected industrial espionage by four of his new
employees, most notably production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua. A special bombardment was reserved for 'our opponents'.
Displaying a mild tan and no signs of resentment at having been dragged back
early from his holidays, he proposed that GM and Adam Opel, its German
subsidiary, call off their 'shady manoeuvrings' and their 'attempts to abuse
the public prosecutor's office, the media and public opinion'.
His first press conference on the issue has followed a bad spell for the VW
side in which the company failed to secure a gag on the news magazine Der
Spiegel, which had aired suspicions and allegations that Mr Lopez and
members of his team systematically plundered GM's confidential data banks
and files before joining VW. This attempt at gagging was the result of bad
advice, Mr Piech said yesterday.
Then state prosecutors investigating GM's suspicions of industrial espionage
decided to widen their probe from Mr Lopez and his first lieutenant Mr
Manuel Gutierrez, to include two more GM defectors after establishing
possible links between Mr Lopez and documents found in their former home.
While pondering aloud if foreign reporters were aware of the law in Germany
 -that a person is innocent until proven guilty - he appeared well briefed
when confronted with detailed questions on his allegations. His normal
stop-go style of delivery was more than usually punctuated by pauses.
He reminded his audience of his interview with the weekly magazine Stern, to
be published today, that VW had been subjected to mud-slinging - although he
did not repeat what he told the magazine, that it would defend itself
accordingly.
His suspicions were based on facts, he claimed. Facts such as the 'unknown
ways' in which four boxes of papers and slides, including details of a
secret Opel mini-car project, reached investigating prosecutors from their
place under the stairs in the former home of the defectors, Mr Jorge Alvarez
Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza.
In the time between their departure from Opel - and from their Wiesbaden
house - for Volkswagen and Wolfsburg, 'other hands' had been involved, he
said. Meanwhile, two audits of VW computers had not turned up anything
untoward.
But Mr Piech seemed happier on the firmer ground of 'facts' than in the
mud-patch. His demeanour brightened visibly when he turned to his constant
companion - a shiny alloy briefcase - to rummage for market data.
He had focused his presentation on an extract from a New York Times
interview with Mr Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at
University of Cardiff in Wales. 'This is corporate war. GM wants Volkswagen
to stay a big, uncompetitive and bureaucratic company. This is a campaign by
GM to do exactly that. . . They are going after Lopez until they get him,'
according to Mr Jones.
Mr Piech had found in Mr Jones a valuable and authoritative ally to support
his contention that GM's assault is a commercially motivated war designed to
damage VW at a time when it is fighting not only for its own survival but
that of the whole European motor industry.
GM, VW claims, wants to deprive its Wolfsburg competitor, regardless of the
means used, of its prize catch, Mr Lopez, and disrupt the restructuring.
From his briefcase he fished detailed data on recent increases in incoming
orders, to supplement figures in his opening statement showing that VW's
top-selling Golf was widening its market share advantage over Opel's Astra
rival.
VW's second-quarter loss would be considerably less than the DM1.25bn
(Pounds 480m) deficit in the first three months of this year, and the group
would return to profit in the third quarter. It was implicit that GM had
reason to be worried about the rapid revival of its wounded but agile
European competitor.
News agency portable telephones clicked, and in faraway Frankfurt the market
gave Mr Piech an implied round of applause - a rise of almost DM12 in the VW
share price.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Tory party workers braced for by-election defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE party workers in Christchurch were bracing themselves for
defeat in today's by-election, as last-minute campaigning drew to an end in
the Dorset seaside constituency.
But with all parties reporting that a significant proportion of voters
canvassed were still wavering, the size of the expected anti-Tory swing
remained uncertain.
A victory for the Liberal Democrats in the former Conservative stronghold
would cut the government's overall majority in the House of Commons to 17.
A disaster for the Tories in the constituency they held by more than 23,000
in the general election has been so widely predicted that the political
damage has to some extent been discounted. Even so, a large majority for Mrs
Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, would be a fresh humiliation
for Mr John Major's beleaguered administration.
The government's efforts to put the difficulties of the past year behind it
were dealt a further setback by a national opinion poll which showed support
for the Tories at 27 per cent - their lowest rating since December 1981.
Only 19 per cent of those questioned were satisfied with the prime
minister's performance, while almost three-quarters were dissatisfied.
The Mori survey, in today's Times also showed rising support for the Liberal
Democrats at 25 per cent, while Labour was on 44 per cent. The polling was
taken between 22-26 July with a sample of 1,689 people.
In Christchurch, Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, sought to
capitalise on the recent signs of economic recovery.
But party workers brought in to support Mr Rob Hayward, the Tory candidate,
appeared to be pinning some hope on discontented Conservatives abstaining.
One or two activists even conceded that their task was to contain the
Liberal Democrat majority rather than win the seat.
Although the government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel
have been a significant reason for the loss of support in the constituency,
Sir Norman ruled out any changes in VAT policy after the by-election.
Labour, widely predicted to come a poor third in the vote, said it hoped
that the growing anti-Tory sentiment in the area would help Labour to secure
greater support in the south in the next election.
A total of 14 candidates are standing in the by-election, which was caused
by the death of Conservative MP, Mr Robert Adley.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Bundesbank move raises hopes of discount rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JUDY DEMPSEY

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday cut the cost of lending short term funds to
commercial banks, raising expectations that it would reduce its official
rates at a council meeting today and quell growing currency tensions inside
the European exchange rate mechanism.
The German central bank's cut in its repo rate from 7.15 per cent to 6.95
per cent was slightly larger than currency dealers had expected, and raised
hopes that it would today cut the internationally sensitive discount rate,
which sets the floor for all German money market rates.
The bank cut its discount rate to 6.75 per cent from 7.25 per cent on July
2. The Lombard rate was lowered from 8.50 per cent to 8.25 per cent at the
same time.
Yesterday's repo rate cut helped quell tensions in the ERM at the start of
European trading, including heavy selling of the Spanish peseta and
Portuguese escudo, and continued pressure on the French franc.
Analysts were uncertain about what decision the Bundesbank would have to
take today to quell tensions in the ERM during the remaining summer weeks.
In UK financial markets, there was strong speculation that a large cut in
German interest rates today might allow the British government to lower base
rates, currently at 6 per cent.
Some dealers in sterling interest rate markets were confident base rates
would be cut within weeks. That speculation pushed sterling  1/4 pfennig
down against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.5675. It was little
changed at DM2.5687 in New York. The Bundesbank meeting, the last before the
summer recess, will be the most keenly watched event in currency markets
since the ERM crisis of last September.
There was a strong assumption in the London market that the Bundesbank would
cut its discount rate by  1/2 a percentage point. Some analysts believed
rates would need to ease  3/4 of a percentage point for France and other ERM
countries to have an opportunity to lower the cost of short term borrowing.
There were fears that the Bundesbank was giving priority to domestic price
stability rather than the ERM. 'If we do not cut the discount rate, then the
French franc might go the same way as sterling, and leave the system,' a
German economist said. 'The view will be that the Bundesbank is not
committed to ERM, or to the second phase of the Maastricht treaty.'
Yesterday's cut in the repo rate halted intense selling of the Spanish
peseta, which fell by about 2 per cent against the D-Mark in early European
trading. There was also heavy selling of the Portuguese escudo, which fell
to a historic low against the D-Mark, and neared its ERM floor against the
German currency. Both currencies recovered after the Bundesbank's action,
the Spanish peseta closing at Pta80.41 against the German currency. The
French franc rallied to close at FFr3.405, amid a slight softening in French
money market interest rates.

FT  29 JUL 93 / VW chief seeks to restore confidence
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, bruised by allegations from General Motors of industrial
espionage, yesterday sought to restore confidence with claims that it was
winning the war in the European car market.
At a press conference at his company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Mr
Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, aired suspicions of dirty tricks, and repeated
charges that GM had resorted to mud-slinging to further its allegations of
industrial espionage by VW employees.
But he also produced data which suggested that VW was making a strong
recovery after its loss of DM1.25bn (Pounds 480m) in the first quarter. He
said orders in June were more than 15 per cent up on the same month last
year and that the new Golf model had widened its market lead over the Astra,
built by Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
Mr Piech cited an independent motor industry expert's view that GM was
trying to damage VW in a commercially motivated war, started after Mr Piech
hired Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's global procurement director,
in March.
In his first press conference to defend VW, Mr Lopez and four former GM
employees who followed Mr Lopez to the German car maker, Mr Piech quoted Mr
Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff University:
'This is a war.'
He used Mr Jones's opinions to support VW's claims that the industrial
espionage allegations were untrue but were being used to further GM's real
aim - to disrupt the German group's recovery programme by depriving it of
the renowned cost-cutting and innovative production skills of Mr Lopez and
key members of his GM team.
But he returned to the attack with accusations that the US group was
attempting 'to abuse public prosecutors (investigating GM's spying charges),
the media and public opinion to slander our company'.
A recent press release from the prosecutors, which linked Mr Lopez with
confidential GM group data found in four boxes in a Wiesbaden house formerly
occupied by two of his so-called 'warriors', was 'tainted with
one-sidedness', Mr Piech charged.
It had led to unlawful public prejudgment of Volkswagen. The boxes had been
'in other hands' in the time between Mr Lopez's colleagues leaving the house
and the delivery of the material by 'unknown' and 'indirect' ways to the
police, he claimed.
The prosecutors office said yesterday: 'We are absolutely sure of our
facts.'
In Frankfurt the VW share price closed up DM11.70 at DM359.70, while other
German car makers fell sharply and the blue-chip Dax index dropped more than
11 points to 1,833.91.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Drug groups forge global link-ups: Wide-ranging deals aim to
counter cuts in government spending on medicines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR of the world's largest drugs companies yesterday announced wide-ranging
deals as part of the global industry's attempt to adapt to reduced
government spending on medicines.
Warner-Lambert of the US and Britain's Wellcome have negotiated a global
joint venture which will fuse their over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription
medicines businesses. The US group has also formed a strategic alliance with
Glaxo Holdings, Europe's biggest drugs company, to market OTC versions of
the British company's prescription drugs.
The deals provide Warner-Lambert with top products which it can market over
the counter and enable Wellcome and Glaxo to generate revenues from the
fast-growing OTC market, while relieving them of the need to spend large
sums promoting OTC medicines.
Meanwhile, US-based Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, has agreed to
acquire Medco Containment, the largest US mail order drugs distributor, for
Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn). The deal will bring Merck into the fast-growing
drugs mail order market, which was worth about Dollars 3.9bn last year.
Warner-Lambert's deals give it access to two of the world's eight
top-selling prescription drugs - Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment Zantac, which
had prescription sales last year of Dollars 3.4bn, and Wellcome's anti-viral
medicine, Zovirax, which had sales of Dollars 1.15bn.
Neither Zovirax nor Zantac has been licensed as an OTC product by the US
Food and Drug Administration. However, most successful OTC products have
previously been prescription medicines. Although Warner-Lambert is one of
the world's leading OTC companies, it has few prescription drugs that could
be sold over the counter.
The OTC market is expected to grow rapidly as more prescription drugs lose
their patent protection. Governments are encouraging products to switch from
prescription to OTC status, as consumers pay directly for non-prescription
drugs.
'This is a first-class deal for Wellcome,' said Mr John Robb, chief
executive. 'There will be more of these deals, and we are pleased to have
stolen a march on the opposition.'
Warner-Lambert's joint venture with Wellcome, to be called Warner Wellcome
Consumer Health Products, would have had sales last year of Dollars 1.6bn,
making it the third largest OTC company in the US after Johnson &amp; Johnson
and American Home Products. It will be the fourth largest in Europe.
Mr John Walsh, president of Warner-Lambert's consumer sector, said the new
business continued to be weak in Germany and would need to be strengthened.
Zovirax was the only licensed treatment for genital herpes in the US and had
huge potential, he said. There were no plans to submit an application in the
US for a Zovirax cream for cold-sores. In Germany and the UK the drug has
OTC approval for this illness.
Mr Robb said Zovirax's move in the US from prescription to OTC status was
sensitive because it involved genital herpes, but the company was working
constructively with the FDA on the subject. Last month, Syntex, the US
company, had its application to switch an analgesic called Naprosyn turned
down by the FDA.
Wellcome's OTC business had sales last year of about Dollars 340m,
representing about 14 per cent of group sales. Warner-Lambert will not be
bringing its Rolaids anti-acid treatment or Halls cough drops to the joint
venture.
The US group will be the managing partner of the new company and receive 70
per cent of US profits. Wellcome, which will have three of the seven members
of the board, will receive the remainder. For the rest of the world, the
profits will be shared on an approximately equal basis.
Glaxo's alliance with Warner-Lambert confirms chairman Sir Paul Girolami's
insistence that his company will not diversify from prescription medicines.
Mr Franz Humer, Glaxo's chief operating director, said there was no link
between the deal and the recent sacking of Dr Ernest Mario as group chief
executive.
Glaxo's joint venture will concentrate on developing Zantac in the US and
Europe, although not Japan where it already has an agreement.
In London, Wellcome's shares rose 31p to 696p, while Glaxo closed up 10p at
558p. Warner-Lambert closed unchanged at Dollars 67 1/4 on Wall Street.
Merck's shares ended down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 3/4.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Economists call for end to ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX of the world's most eminent economists, including three Nobel
prizewinners, today call for France to lead the way in the abandonment of
the European exchange rate mechanism.
In an article in the Financial Times, timed to coincide with today's
Bundesbank council meeting, they argue that Europe is repeating the mistake
of the 1930s, when countries tried to maintain currency values in spite of
economic depression.
The economists say: 'In 1931, when Britain went off gold, a baffled
ex-labour minister noted: 'They never told us we could do such a thing.'
Just in case the message has not got through to France and Spain: no, it is
not un-European to uncouple from the D-Mark, and not even unwise.'
The six - Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch Stanley Fischer, Franco
Modigliani, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow - are all professors of
economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professors Modigliani,
Samuelson and Solow are past recipients of the Nobel prize for economics.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Suez-UAP talks over joint
interests on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between Suez, the French holding company, and Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurer, over their joint insurance interests
are still on hold despite the former's bid to raise its stake in Victoire,
the French insurer in which they have a joint holding.
Suez on Monday unveiled details of an offer to buy the 2 per cent of
Victoire's shares that it does not already own in concert with UAP. Suez,
which controls Victoire with a 63 per cent stake and holds 98 per cent of
the voting rights in concert with UAP, is offering FFr1,480 for each of the
remaining 360,000 shares.
However, Suez said that the offer did not affect its policy on UAP's plans
to take control of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire. UAP
has been trying to persuade Suez to cede control of Colonia, but Suez late
last year broke off negotiations after a disagreement over price.
Nevertheless, analysts said yesterday that the deal could foreshadow the
resumption of negotiations between the two groups over the UAP stake in
Victoire.
Mr Michael Huttner, European insurance analyst with BZW Securities in
London, said Suez's acquisition of the Victoire minorities could lead to a
closer integration of the holding company with its insurance subsidiary.
'We are regarding this as a prelude to a wider deal. It is the first step in
the real drama which will eventually lead to UAP getting hold of Colonia,'
said Mr Huttner.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Stock speculator arrested in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S securities watchdog finally showed its teeth yesterday when
prosecutors arrested a leading stock speculator and a finance company
official for alleged stock price manipulation.
It is the first time that investigations by the Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission, set up in July last year, have led to a crackdown
by the prosecutors on stock transactions.
The Tokyo district public prosecutor's office arrested Mr Makoto Araya, a
stock speculator, and a former executive of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, an
unlisted financing subsidiary of Sumitomo Realty and Development.
Mr Araya is suspected of ramping the stock price of Nihon Unisys, the 32 per
cent owned Japanese affiliate of the US computer group, during 1990 and
1991, through loans totaling some Y55bn (Dollars 514m) from Mr Hiroshi
Kimura, former senior managing director of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance.
The SESC conducted a well publicised raid on the offices of Sumitomo Fudosan
Finance last December, and claimed that Mr Araya used more than 10 accounts
at 27 brokerages to trade Nihon Unisys stock. In May, the commission called
for the indictment of Mr Araya and Mr Kimura for violating the Securities
and Exchange Law.
The commission, modelled on the US Securities and Exchange Commission, was
set up after a spate of stock market scandals shocked investors, fuelling
the fall on the Tokyo stock market. However, it has found it difficult to
cultivate the image of an aggressive and independent watchdog, due to its
closeness to the Finance Ministry, with which it shares a building and
staff.
On the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, fears that investigation by the
prosecutors may spread to Sumitomo Realty and Development depressed its
share price, which fell Y14 to Y706.

<TEXT>
INDONESIAN troops have killed an estimated 2,000 civilians in their attempts
in recent years to crush a Moslem separatist rebellion in the Aceh area of
northern Sumatra, Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
group, says in a report published today.
Most of the victims were ordinary people with no involvement in the armed
opposition movement called Aceh Merdeka, Amnesty says, and some were
children or very old.
'Some of those killed were publicly executed,' the organisation says.
'Others were 'mysteriously killed,' the corpses left in public places -
beside a main road, in fields and plantations - apparently as a warning to
others not to join or support the rebels.'
Amnesty says Aceh Merdeka members, many of whom were trained in Libya in the
late 1980s, have also committed human rights abuses.
It says the officially-sanctioned murder of civilians has declined since
early 1991, but rejects claims that life in Aceh has returned to normal.

FT  28 JUL 93 / S Korea-Taiwan pact signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA and Taiwan yesterday signed an agreement establishing unofficial
ties after breaking diplomatic relations last August when Seoul recognised
Beijing as China's only legitimate government.
The pact, which was signed in Osaka, Japan, after several rounds of talks,
is likely to lead to the lifting of commercial sanctions against South Korea
imposed by Taiwan in retaliation.
An import ban was imposed on Korean cars, which amounted to 11,000 vehicles
valued at Dollars 110m last year, and air and sea links were suspended.
Anti-dumping suits were filed against Korean steel, chemical and
petrochemical products. South Koreans seeking to work in Taiwan also faced
restrictions.
A deadlock on restoring relations was broken when Taiwan dropped its demand
that its offices in Seoul and Pusan bear the name of the Republic of China.
It instead accepted the name of Taipei.
It also originally sought to keep all its government assets in Korea, but
has now agreed to negotiate directly with China on the ownership of
non-diplomatic property, such as state-sponsored schools. China took over
Taiwan's embassy building in Seoul last year, while Taiwan retained its
office in Pusan.
In return, Seoul agreed to recognise the Taiwanese offices as 'missions,'
which suggest they have higher diplomatic status than representative
offices.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Bonn attack on recycling bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S plan to introduce innovative environmental legislation forcing
producers to take back and recycle consumer goods is badly conceived and
threatens enterprises, parliamentarians said yesterday.
Dealing a blow to the government, members of the coalition parties in
parliament said the bill had to be significantly changed before it would
gain parliamentary approval.
The draft law, the first of its kind in Europe, was tabled by the government
in April and aims to encourage the collection and recycling of consumer
durables.
Specific recycling requirements for different products would then be decreed
by the federal ministry for the environment and the applications of these
legal requirements would be left to the Lander governments.
Parliamentarians yesterday warned against allowing state authorities to have
too much power in deciding how recycling requirements are carried out.
'Recycling must stay in the hands of the enterprises,' said Mr Gerhard
Friedrich, Christian Democratic Union MP in the environment committee.
'We must also make sure that the law is not going to lead to excessive
bureaucracy,' he added.
In particular, coalition MPs fear that the law would be misused in Lander
which are governed by opposition Social Democrats calling for stricter
recycling laws.
Social Democrats, who control the Bundesrat, the German upper chamber in the
parliament, recently said they would only adopt the draft law if tougher
requirements were put in place. They want, among others, stricter recycling
quotas for consumer goods and bans on specific chemicals used to produce
consumer goods.
Coalitions MPs say such requirements could hinder the competitiveness of
German companies and would especially burden small and medium-sized
companies.
They are instead calling on the government to let companies decide how to
recycle the goods they would have to take back from consumers.
Higher fees for landfills would also encourage manufacturers to find
recycling technologies for their products, they say.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Bosnia rivals discuss carve-up: Ethnic leaders meet for
first face-to-face talks in six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic last night held face-to-face talks with
Serb and Croat rivals for the first time since January as negotiations began
which could lead to the ethnic division of Bosnia.
The leaders of the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia met for unscheduled
talks which included Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian
counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro,
which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state.
The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to drop his demand that a
future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have
called for the creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says
will lead to more war and the possible annexation of large parts of Bosnia
to Serbia and Croatia.
The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created
mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well
as the US.
Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the special envoy of US president Bill Clinton who
so far has maintained a distance from the peace talks, yesterday met Mr
Izetbegovic for private talks.
The mediators have pledged, in the event of the republic's ethnic division,
that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of
Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern
River Sava.
They appear convinced, despite the upsurge in fighting in Bosnia, that Serb
and Croat leaders would be willing to make territorial concessions to the
Moslems.
Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory and the Croats
about 20 per cent.
Mr Izetbegovic is likely to be sceptical that the international community
will provide muscle to back the security of a Bosnian state. But Mr Mustafa
Bijedic, chief of Bosnia's UN mission in Geneva, yesterday said: 'We were
encouraged by the signs of support expressed by the co-chairmen.'
Michael Littlejohns at the UN, New York, adds: French United Nations troops
yesterday came under fire in Sarajevo for the second time in two days when
shells hit a television building where they were setting up a communications
base.
Following the first artillery bombardment on French soldiers, on Sunday, UN
commanders blamed the Bosnian Serbs and threatened to retaliate if
peacekeeping forces came under attack again.
The attack prompted Nato to signal it was moving closer to military
intervention, saying it expected to provide air cover over Bosnia 'sooner
rather than later'.
Nato had assembled 60 combat aircraft at bases in Italy but Britain, France
and the Netherlands had failed to place in Bosnia the forward air
controllers needed to guide them, a United Nations official said.

FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bundesbank hopes spur equity gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate optimism, focused on tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank
policy council, drove the UK stock market ahead by nearly 36 points on the
FT-SE 100 scale yesterday as investors hastened to buy stock in a securities
sector suddenly devoid of sellers.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed at 2,879.4, up a net 35.2, and the September
futures contract on the index came within a few points of the 2,900 area,
regarded as the higher end of the current trading range. New peaks on Wall
Street also encouraged UK equities in their recovery from the weakness of
the past fortnight.
Equity strategists took the view that the Bundesbank will tomorrow make some
move in the direction of lower rates. German inflation data, announced
yesterday, were thought unlikely to block a rate cut, although there was
some doubt over which of its key rates the German central bank would choose
to change.
On the domestic front, a report from the Confederation of British Industry
warned that export difficulties might limit growth but the UK Treasury
stressed the signs of economic recovery. The likelihood that the UK
government will suffer badly at tomorrow's by-election in Christchurch,
Dorset, appeared to have been well discounted in the stock market.
The corporate scene featured the announcement of plans by Pearson, owner of
the Financial Times, to demerge its Royal Doulton fine china division and to
sell, by public offering in New York, a majority interest in Camco, the
oilfield equipment and services division.
With Reuters, the global news and information group, planning a Pounds 350m
share buyback, investors were examining other blue chip companies which
might make similar moves to unlock shareholder value.
The Footsie is now within 3 per cent of its all-time high of 2,957.3,
reached on March 8, but strategists sounded unconvinced yesterday that this
week's sharp rise in share prices is more than a technical recovery from a
period of weakness. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the broader-ranging market
measure, was also in good form yesterday, gaining 23.5 at 3,238.7, within 3
points of its all-time peak.
Trading volume rose sharply, boosted by heavy turnover in Pearson shares, as
well as by strong demand for many Wall Street-orientated stocks, including
oils and pharmaceuticals. Seaq volume jumped to 662.6m shares from the
483.6m of the previous session. Monday's Seaq turnover reflected retail
business of only Pounds 900.2m, the first time that genuine customer
business has fallen below Pounds 1bn on any full trading session for many
months.
Traders stressed that stock positions were tight yesterday and that share
prices were forced higher by a general unwillingness to sell. The sudden
reversal of market fortunes caught marketmakers in many leading sectors
unawares.
Shares in the banking and pharmaceutical sectors could hardly be bought
yesterday at prices some 3 per cent above levels at which they had been
languishing barely 36 hours earlier.
Upward pressures on the blue chip internationals increased in late trading
when Wall Street moved to a fresh peak early in its new trading session,
adding nearly 9 Dow points in UK trading hours.

FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEIGHTENED hopes for a German interest rate cut at tomorrow's Bundesbank
council meeting prompted a squeeze and fuelled a strong performance in stock
index futures, writes Christine Buckley.
Dealers, anxious not to be caught short should their interest rate cut hopes
come true, moved back into the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index.
The interest boosted volume to 12,150 lots, only a little short of double
the previous day's amount.
The appeal of the contract was bolstered by its healthy premium to the
underlying cash market, which at times touched a lead of 20 points. It
finished 10 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash.
Increased volume in the cash market also stimulated interest in futures.
The September contract opened at 2,867 and gave up only a point in early
trading before pushing steadily upwards. The day's high came in the last
half-hour when it reached 2,897, and a little selling brought it back to a
close of 2,894. The December contract finished at 2,904.
Investor interest was mixed, coming from large institutions and independent
traders.
Traded options saw active trading, with volume swelling to 36,760 lots.
Equity options business was stimulated by today's expiry of the July option.
The most heavily traded stock option was British Steel on 4,688 lots dealt.

FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel shot forward after stating that it had
reached agreement on the completion of the work on the tunnel with
TransManche Link (TML), the construction consortium on the project.
The stock finished 27 ahead at 434p after strong business of 1m shares, with
the stock also heavily traded in Paris. However, dealers had to wait until
after the market close to hear further details about the agreement and the
outlook for the company.
Several stocks benefited from the positive news at Eurotunnel. These
included BICC, one of the UK members of the TML consortium and a weak
feature in recent sessions. The shares rallied 18 to 416p.
News that the Taiwan government had formally approved Taiwan Aerospace's
regional jets joint venture with British Aerospace boosted trading in the UK
group. The shares advanced 13 to 422p, with volume reaching 3.3m.
Analysts in London expect that the private sector in Taiwan will soon
provide the rest of the necessary funding for the project.
Conglomerate Williams Holdings, 4 firmer at 319p, was said to have been
boosted by a recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken.
Among motor issues, a 'buy' recommendation from Panmure Gordon helped T.
Cowie appreciate 6 1/2 to 243 1/2 p, ahead of next week's interim figures.
Also recommended was Lex Service, 6 higher at 396p. Traders expect both
companies to benefit from next month's UK new car registrations. The
prospect of good August car sales saw Avon Rubber move ahead 11 to 505p.
Shell Transport strengthened 7 1/2 to 627 1/2 p, with Kleinwort Benson
reported to have urged investors to buy the stock. British Petroleum added 5
at 300p after encouraging news from its BP Exploration subsidiary about
drilling in the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset.
BZW moved Kingfisher from a 'buy' to a 'hold', believing the shares to be
overvalued after their recent good run. The stock clung to an early gain and
closed 4 ahead at 609p.
Good two-way business in Sears left the stock 2 firmer at 98p after 11m
shares traded.
There were downgrades and rumours of more to follow in Guinness following
the profits warning on Monday from LVMH. The French group, which has a 24.6
per cent cross-shareholding in Guinness, said it expected first-half profits
to fall because of poor champagne sales.
Kleinwort Benson chopped Pounds 27m from its current year forecast to Pounds
947m, but Guinness gained a penny at 445p.
The recent bid speculation in transport container group Tiphook all but
faded. The shares were left trailing the market with a retreat of 12 to 235p
on substantial profit-taking.
British Airways was another casualty of profit-taking following its recent
run, relinquishing 2 to 327p.
Improved full year figures at Stagecoach Holdings pushed the shares up 4 to
140p.
Evidence of movement in the direct property market is feeding through to
positive sentiment in the property sector, according to one industry
specialist. Already a firm sector, it is enjoying further boosts. British
Land rose 6 to 345p, Hammerson 'A' 5 to 330p and MEPC 9 to 469p.
US interest was reported in General Accident, which put on 12 at 648p.
Among banks, Lloyds Bank continued to be a strong feature ahead of interim
figures expected on Friday. Shares in the bank climbed 15 to 582p, extending
the determined recovery in the stock seen since the start of the week.
Shares in Reuters, the international news and information group, had a
volatile ride as the company published its interim figures. They traded
strongly ahead of the announcement, which showed an improvement of 14.5 per
cent in profits to Pounds 214.7m, in line with market expectations.
However, an unexciting accompanying statement saw the earlier gain
surrendered before confidence was restored in the last hour of trading
following an upbeat meeting with analysts. The stock was finally 4 ahead at
1444p after good business of 1.7m shares.

Anticipation of a positive analysts' meeting tomorrow and an upgrade of
profits expectations helped Cable and Wireless advance smartly. The shares
climbed 16 to 790p.
Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a majority stake, is addressing analysts
over current trading, and telecoms specialists expect to hear positive news
about the group's trading.
Also yesterday, UBS was said to have upgraded C&amp;W, raising its earnings per
share figure from 42.8p to 44.1p on the back of recent good trading news.
Hoare Govett also renewed its positive recommendation.

FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pearson sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The move by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to concentrate on its
media interests and demerge Royal Doulton, its fine china division, and
Camco, its oilfield equipment and services arm, was well received in the
stock market. Even the sale yesterday afternoon by Mr Rupert Murdoch of
16.48m Pearson shares, via a placing by Goldman Sachs, failed to hold back
the share price, which rose 27 to 467p.
Royal Doulton will be listed on the London market later this year, while a
majority interest in Camco will be offered in New York next year.
Although the demerger move took analysts by surprise, it was welcomed by
market watchers, who are increasingly keen on moves by conglomerates to
streamline assets. The fact that Mr Murdoch's shares were absorbed without
difficulty at 464p was viewed as a sign that there was a healthy appetite
for Pearson stock.
Trading in Pearson shares took the price to a day's high of 484p, before
easing back to the closing level. Turnover came to 39m shares.
The implications of Pearson's plans brought sympathetic demand for Reed
International, which moved ahead 11 to 657p.

FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Changes likely at Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL and drugs group Boots is believed to be considering savage cuts to
its loss-making Do It All home improvement business and also entertaining
offers for its pharmaceutical research division, according to analysts who
attended a meeting with management on Monday night.
The possibility that such moves could bring a special one-off dividend
payment to shareholders was also raised at the meeting, although a company
spokesman yesterday denied that it was under active consideration.
Analysts expressed relief that tough action appeared to be under way at Do
It All, which Boots runs in a joint venture with WH Smith. Boots indicated
that it was considering closing around half of its 200 DIY stores, and
implementing a substantial refurbishment programme in the remaining units to
bolster its faltering market share. Even so, some stores sector specialists
in the City believe Boots may yet reconsider its position in the DIY market
if the necessary improvements are not forthcoming in six months' time.
While the company said it remained committed to its drugs division, analysts
said that privately the company was resigned to withdrawing from this area
of business. Speculation that the company would make a disposal has grown
following its withdrawal last week of Manoplax, its top-selling heart drug.
Boots added 5 at 447p in another day's hefty turnover of 6.8m. WH Smith 'A'
gained 2 at 446p.

FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recedes a little in spite
of IBM rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS edged lower from their record high yesterday in spite of a rebound
in IBM shares after the computer group's second-quarter results were
released, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.24 off at 3,565.46. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 eased 0.85 to 448.24 and the Nasdaq composite shed 3.54 to
701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE was 257m shares.
Analysts expected some early losses following Monday's record-breaking
performance by the Dow, when the leading average finished at an all-time
high of 3,567.70. In spite of the record, the markets remain jittery, as
indicated by the failure of other indices to match the Dow's performance,
and by early selling yesterday. This repeated the recent pattern of quick
profit-taking on the day after a solid rise in share prices.
The day's main economic news - a small decline in the Conference Board's
July consumer confidence index - was not good for market sentiment; but it
had little impact on prices because it had been forecast, and because the
attention of investors and dealers was primarily concentrated on IBM's
results, which were released during the morning.
IBM announced a second-quarter loss of Dollars 8bn, or Dollars 14.10 a
share, after taking a big charge against earnings to cover job cuts and
plant closures. The group also made a dividend cut. In the days running up
to the announcement, IBM's stock had fallen in expectation of a heavy loss,
further restructuring and a dividend reduction.
IBM's operating income, before the charge, was better than expected, which
explained why investors greeted the results with a steady stream of buying.
IBM closed Dollars 3 1/4 up at Dollars 45 5/8 , near its high for the day.
There were declines elsewhere in the sector. Data General eased Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 8 1/8 on news that losses at the minicomputer manufacturer
widened in its fiscal third quarter to Dollars 16.4m due to continued weak
sales of its proprietary computer products.
Stratus Computer tumbled Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 23 3/4 after unveiling
flat second-quarter earnings and warning that its earnings for the full year
would come in below the 1992 level.
USX-US Steel fell Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after the International
Trade Commission issued a ruling broadly favourable to foreign steel makers
in a dispute with the US government over steel pricing. Analysts fear the
ruling will force US steel groups to cut their prices.
On the Nasdaq market, Novell dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 18 3/8 as
investors reacted to Monday's late warning that its third-quarter income
would be lower than that from the second quarter. Aldus rose Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 17 1/4 on reporting a return to profitability after posting a
loss a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO finished sharply higher for the second consecutive day, but still in
relatively subdued trading. The TSE 300 index jumped 42.1 to 3,911.6 and
rises outpaced declines by 463 to 275 after volume of 46.2m shares valued at
CDollars 522m. The gold shares index rose a further 2.66 per cent. Energy
stocks gained 1.5 per cent.

FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses easier ahead of Buba
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW's Bundesbank meeting, the last until August 26, remained on most
investors' minds yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
There is a view that even if a rate cut does occur the turmoil in the ERM
will continue. UBS, in a global strategy paper published on Monday, wrote
that 'the key question is what amount of easing is needed by the Germans to
stabilise the ERM lastingly, in view of the fact that in the past 10 months
the German repo rate has fallen by 260 basis points.
'The answer surely is much more than the Bundesbank will be willing to give
in the near term and the conclusion must therefore be that an end to the
long running ERM crisis cannot be expected from this week's meeting'.
While forecasting that the Buba could leave interest rates unchanged
tomorrow, the UBS strategists noted that 'the risks to this view are
steadily increasing as international pressure mounts'. UBS suggested that a
25 basis point reduction in the discount rate could happen - anything
greater virtually ruled out by the 'deterioration in domestic economic
conditions' - accompanied perhaps by a 50 basis point cut in the Lombard.
FRANKFURT featured cars and banks as the overall market slipped back
slightly after Monday's solid rise. The DAX index closed off 9.29 at
1,845.23 in turnover of DM10bn.
BMW surprised some analysts after announcing a 39 per cent fall in first
half net profit and the shares drifted down DM16.50 to DM562.00. Daimler
slipped DM2.80, having earlier seen a high of DM694.50, on news that it was
to be listed in New York.
Volkswagen eased DM6 to DM348 during the session before rising to DM350.50
in the after market on news that a news conference had been called for today
at which the group will comment on the 'Lopez affair'.
The major banks went against the market trend, Commerzbank up 80 pfg at
DM318.80, Deutsche 70 pfg higher at DM744.70 and Dresdner up DM1.80 at
DM399.80, on expectations of strong operating gains in forthcoming interim
results.
PARIS fell back through the 2,000 barrier in a thin market. Eurotunnel
featured with a gain of FFr2.30 or 6.3 per cent to FFr38.60 after the group
said that it had reached agreement with TML on completion of the project.
AMSTERDAM was unchanged on the day, the CBS Tendency index closing at 119.2,
although there were some steep falls among a number of stocks.
DSM retreated another Fl 1.90 to Fl 94.70 ahead of tomorrow's interim
results while KLM slipped Fl 1.20 to Fl 33.00, Philips lost 10 cents to Fl
31.20 as the group said that it was to sell its Magnavox unit.
BRUSSELS saw late selling in what some analysts thought might be the start
of a consolidation phase after the recent rally. The Bel-20 index gave up
early gains to finish 5.69 lower at 1,301.49.
Ms Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson thought that the market was ready for a
correction, noting that the rally had been led by strength in cyclical
stocks which were now looking over extended on fundamentals. The Belgian
franc was under pressure and there was also some nervousness as the
government began to review its 1994 budget plans, she said.
Solvay, opening the interim reporting season today, fell BF200 or 1.6 per
cent to BFr12,075 on expectations of a net loss of between BFr500m and
BFr1bn, following the collapse of the European bulk chemical industry and
restructuring charges.
Clabecq, the steel group, continued to surge ahead, rising BFr130 or 16.3
per cent to BFr930 on continued speculative buying, for a 55 per cent rise
over three sessions.
ZURICH encountered profit-taking which left shares off their best levels but
the SMI index finished 9.7 higher at 2,398.5, on expectations that interest
rates still have some way fall.
Nestle continued back in favour, adding SFr22 to SFr1,055 in active trading.
MILAN reversed the lower trend of the previous four sessions in volume that
picked up strongly after Monday's lull and the Comit index rose 7.35 to
556.68.
The telecommunications sector returned to favour with some large foreign
orders driving Sip L100 or 3.7 per cent higher to L2,778 in volume of 14m
shares.
Short-covering helped Ferruzzi L31 or 7.9 per cent higher to L421.5 while
speculative buying took Montedison L51 or 7.6 per cent ahead to L719 as the
committee of leading creditor banks said that their rescue package would be
ready by the end of August.
VIENNA was unable to sustain an early 3 per cent advance and the ATX index
edged back to finish 13.7 or 1.4 per cent ahead at 967.12.
ISTANBUL fell sharply for the ninth consecutive day and the composite index
lost 298.88 to 9,071.42, its lowest level this month.

PAKISTANI stock prices continued their bullish fervour yesterday, with the
KSE-100 index closing 13.17 higher at 1,432.07, writes Farhan Bokhari in
Islamabad.
The continuing rise is largely the result of last week's devaluation of the
rupee, which has improved export prospects for textiles. Almost one-third of
the KSE's 652 listed companies are textiles, which have suffered losses
during the past year due to sagging exports.
The market's positive sentiment has also come in response to a visit to
Washington this week by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the prime minister, who is
expected to hold discussions with senior officials at the IMF and World
Bank, to clear the way for fresh loans.

FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Falling money market rates lift Lisbon
stocks - Liquidity is driving Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a shaky start to the year when Lisbon's Banco Totta e Acores (BTA)
index hovered around the 1,700 mark, share prices have rocketed. From a low
of 1,707 in mid-May, the index broke through the 2,000 level in June,
finishing at 2,186 yesterday.
Since the beginning of the year, the BTA index has climbed 34 per cent, a
record bettered only by Turkey. The key to this outstanding rise is money
market interest rates, which have fallen sharply, pushing up liquidity and
making equities more attractive than other securities.
'What is happening here is very similar to events last year in the US and
Europe, when liquidity became the driving force behind markets as interest
rates came down,' says Mr Joao Oliveira Rendeiro, managing director of fund
managers Gestifundo. 'This has been particularly true of the last couple of
weeks of fast price rises.'
Money market rates in Portugal have fallen recently from 17 per cent to
around 10 to 11 per cent. The result has been to create a great pool of
liquidity in the market and divert investors away from bonds and other
securities and into equities.
Short-term economic fundamentals in Portugal are not bright as the country
is sucked into the international recession. But Mr Rendeiro believes that
investors are looking ahead to what he sees as the growth years of 1994 and
1995.
Most of the share market movement is currently being directed by foreign
investors who play a dominant role in the Portuguese market. But analysts
are encouraged by what they see as a surge in investment by domestic
companies as well.
For these reasons, market operators are confident that the outlook for
continued price and volume growth in equities, though it is bound to slow,
remains bright.
The sectors that are faring well fall mainly into the infrastructure
bracket. Portugal will benefit from a high level of EC transfers over the
next five to six years that will provide a high level of business to
constructors and other infrastructure-related sectors.
More than sectors, it is individual companies that stand out for their
performance. Companies related to the Sonae group, based on distribution and
wood products, are faring well, for example. Other distribution companies
are also outshining other sectors.
The Portuguese market has now had time to digest the 'big bang' of operating
and regulatory reforms (the Sapateiro law) which was introduced in September
1991. The operational changes have been successful, with continuous trading
in a national market, a private telephone network to facilitate dealing and
a computerised national stock registration house.
But dealers find the regulatory side of countless rules and articles on
insider dealing, takeovers and mergers, share manipulation and disclosure
bureaucratic.
'The Sapateiro law is an enormously bureaucratic book of regulations that
makes the red tape costs of being listed among the biggest a company faces,'
says Mrs Helen Gray de Castro, chair of Papelaria Fernandes and a board
member of the parent paper company, Inapa. 'To put the Portuguese market in
perspective you have to realise that it is thin, superficial and highly
bureaucratic,' she adds.
Many market operators are also unhappy about new reforms the Finance
Ministry is planning that will make it easier to take over a company without
having to buy 100 per cent of the capital. The current limit of ownership
before a shareholder must launch a bid is 50 per cent.
The government wants to make this 50 per cent excluding indirect holdings.
Brokers feel this would make it too easy to take over a company without
having to make a bid for all the stock - by buying, for example, 30 per cent
of directly owned capital and 30 per cent of indirectly owned capital.
'The government has suffered a lot of negative feedback over this measure,'
says Mr Rendeiro, 'that I feel sure they will withdraw it.'

BUYING BY public pension and insurance funds supported share prices, and the
Nikkei average closed marginally higher on the final day for July delivery,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index was up 69.31 at 19,891.39 after a day's peak of
19,952.00 and low of 19,777.48. A higher futures market prompted buying by
investment trust funds and index-linked demand by arbitrageurs, but most
individual and overseas investors remained on the sidelines.
Volume was below 200m shares for the third consecutive day, totalling 190m
shares against 177m. Advances outscored declines by 565 to 339, with 225
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.90 to
1,625.45, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 0.57 at 1,237.50.
Interest in issues related to Japan Tobacco, the state-owned company, grew
as JT applied for listing yesterday. The company is scheduled to offer a
third of its outstanding shares early next year. East Japan Railway is due
to list its shares in October, while DDI, one of three new telecom
companies, is likely to offer its shares in September.
Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson said the new listings could become a
powerful force for the market. However, some pessimists fear that extra
supply at a time when investor confidence is far from restored, and economic
fundamentals are weak, may depress share prices.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y1,000 to Y889,000 in spite of denials
by the finance minister that the government would offer its remaining
holding in NTT this fiscal year.
Electric power companies gained ground on dealer-led buying. Tokyo Electric
Power rose Y30 to Y3,590. Hopes of credit easing supported banks, with
Industrial Bank of Japan firming Y20 to Y3,140 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to
Y1,680.
Sumitomo Realty and Development lost Y14 to Y706 as former officials of
Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, a financing subsidiary, and a leader of a
speculator group, were arrested yesterday for alleged stock price
manipulation.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 111.57 to 21,953.57 in volume of 11.8m
shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim saw some strong performances.
MANILA returned to its record-setting ways as bargain hunting and Philippine
Long Distance Telephone's overnight rise in New York cut short Monday's
correction.
The composite index moved ahead 34.28 to 1,738.38 as PLDT climbed 25 pesos
to 1,095 pesos following its overnight Dollars  3/8 rise to Dollars 39 1/8
on Wall Street.
AUSTRALIA was pulled higher by soaring gold stocks, and the All Ordinaries
index gained 19.2 at 1,814.9. A return of foreign buyers helped turnover to
expand to a hefty ADollars 368.2m.
The gold shares marker surged 104.8, or 5 per cent, to 2,185.8 as bullion
recovered to around USDollars 393.30 an ounce.
News Corp jumped 24 cents to ADollars 8.30 in volume of 6.3m shares, after
its purchase of 63.6 per cent of Star Television, the Asian satellite
broadcaster.
HONG KONG saw profit-taking erase solid early gains after Hutchison's sale
of its Star network. The Hang Seng index was finally up 7.89 at 6,865.97
after hitting an early high of 6,924.96. Turnover improved to HKDollars
2.9bn from Monday's HKDollars 2.52bn. Hutchison topped the actives list and
added 50 cents at HKDollars 20.40.
NEW ZEALAND advanced to a 40-month high and the NZSE-40 capital index ended
17.04, or 1 per cent, ahead at 1,742.33 in turnover of NZDollars 34m.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Late falls for peseta and krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone came under strong
selling pressure in the European afternoon yesterday, as dealers remained
concerned that the Bundesbank might not cut its official interest rates at
its council meeting tomorrow, writes James Blitz.
The French franc remained relatively calm inside the exchange rate
mechanism. But dealers wondered how the market - and particularly the fund
manager community - might respond if the Bundesbank did not lower the
discount rate by one percentage point at its last council meeting before the
summer.
For the second day running the market did little in anticipation of the
Bundesbank's move. The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark to
close at FFr3.416 from a previous FFr3.414.
The main event in the ERM yesterday was the peseta's fall to the bottom of
the currency grid, as speculators went short of the currency. The Spanish
currency bottomed out at Pta80.90 per D-Mark, prompting a rise in the
country's overnight lending rates to 13.50 per cent from the 12.95 per cent
of the previous day. The peseta ended at Pta80.89, against Monday's close of
Pta80.15.
Undermining the peseta was the belief that the Spanish government was
unwilling to sustain high interest rates for much longer.
At the weekend, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, was reported
as saying that his economic priorities were 'first, jobs, second, jobs, and
third, jobs'.
Adding to the uncertainty were rumours that Spanish unemployment would be
confirmed at 22 per cent in the second quarter, against 21.7 per cent in the
first.
The peseta's drop prompted more falls for the Portuguese escudo and Danish
krone. The Danish currency fell to about DKr3.8930 per D-Mark at the close,
having been at DKr3.8915 at the start of trading.
Sterling fell back sharply yesterday after the Confederation of British
Industry produced a gloomy survey of manufacturing industry showing that
weakening export markets put the recovery at risk.
After a powerful performance on Monday, the pound lost 2 pfennigs yesterday
to close at DM2.5700. Against its Exchange Rate Index sterling was down 50
basis points on the day at 81.5.
The setback for the UK currency may partly have been due to difficulties
breaching the DM2.59 level, which marked the pound's high point since
September of last year. However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency
strategist at Citibank, believes an appre-ciation to DM2.65 is possible,
especially if the ERM crisis drags on.
The dollar remained resilient against the D-Mark in spite of a monthly drop
in US consumer sentiment in July from 58.6 to 57.7. It closed at DM1.7255,
compared with a previous DM1.7245. In New York it ended at DM1.7270.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Focus on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH money market dealers awaiting the results of tomorrow's Bundesbank
council meeting, the focus in interest rate markets turned to sterling and
hopes of another cut in UK base rates before the end of the year, writes
James Blitz.
On Monday, there had been a little more speculation of a cut in UK base
rates as the pound came close to touching DM2.60 against the D-Mark.
Yesterday the currency suffered a sharp setback, but interest rate cut hopes
were kept alive by the slightly gloomy economic forecast from the
Confederation of British Industry.
In its quarterly survey of industrial trends, the CBI said there had been a
weakening of the UK's export markets in Europe, which might weaken the
recovery.
This led to new speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, might
reduce British base rates in his winter budget. The monthly monetary report
from the Treasury also confirmed that inflation was far from imposing any
danger to the UK economy.
The main response to this news came in the futures market, where the
December short sterling contract rose 2 basis points, but later fell back to
close at 94.40, up one basis point on the day. The September contract
finished 2 basis points ahead at 94.17.
Although three-month money in the sterling cash market was unchanged at 6
per cent, there was a sloping of the yield curve further out. The one-year
rate ended  1/16 percentage point down on the day at 5 7/8 per cent. There
was a tiny shortage of Pounds 200m.
In Europe, all eyes remained firmly fixed on tomorrow's Bundesbank council
meeting, with few new clues on how the council will vote.
The Bundesbank announced that it would be holding a variable rate repo for
14 days at variable bid rates. One-day T-Bills continued to be sold at 7.0
per cent. This underlined expectations that the repo rate might come down 15
basis points to 7 per cent. Both the September and December Euromark
contracts were unaltered at 93.39 and 93.98.
French markets were also quiet. The September and December French franc
contracts were unchanged as the franc remained stable in the European
exchange rate mechanism. Although French three-month money hovered around 9
per cent, the spread between the bid and offer rates narrowed to 50 basis
points.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise as Iraq fears
fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME STRENGTH returned to the oil market yesterday with North Sea Brent
crude for September delivery rising 27 cents to Dollars 17.08 a barrel.
Traders said that prices had begun to recover from recent weakness on
suggestions that the Iraqi government's oil export talks with the United
Nations could be put off until September.
Iraq had been talking about a limited return to the export market with a
sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil spread over 6 months. But it now appears
that Saddam Hussein is pressing for a full lifting of UN oil sanctions,
which could take months to negotiate.
'OK, the fundamentals are not that great, but we've still come off Dollars
2.50 a barrel on the back of the Iraqi oil threat and it's now creeping back
up,' said one trader yesterday.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries remains in disarray over
the low oil price and over-production by some members. An emergency meeting
has been put off indefinitely , but with the imminent threat of Iraq's
return removed, the organisation has less need to meet.
Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS, says the supply-demand balance is not
that bad: 'Certainly not as bad as represented by the weak oil prices of the
last couple of weeks'.
Industry stocks are not especially high for the time of year, Mr Pyne
asserts, but some refiners have been building stocks more quickly than usual
in the past month.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK dairy farmers 'to be among
highest paid in EC'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S dairy farmers could be among the highest paid in Europe when the
milk market is opened to competition next year, according to Mr Andrew Dare,
chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board.
Mr Dare will head Milk Marque, the board's successor, which will be a
voluntary farmers' co-operative when it is set up next April. Rules for the
new organisation and farmers' contracts are in place, but the new set-up
must be approved by the government.
The Agriculture bill, which abolished the milk board, received the royal
assent yesterday. Mr Dare said he would submit his re-organisation proposals
in August with industry consultations expected to begin by the end of
September. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the minister of Agriculture, will then
probably approve the Milk Marque structure by the end of October. It also
has to be given the go-ahead by the European Commission.
When Milk Marque was launched, Mr Dare said, he hoped payments to UK farmers
would be among the three highest in Europe. 'With more milk going to fresh
products than any other country in Europe, we should be near the top of the
league on prices, but it would be folly to price milk in this country so
high as to attract imports.'
But Mr Dare said he had not included any price in his draft contracts to
farmers. He was speaking before the final annual meeting of the board in its
present form, where farmers were urged to stand united and join Milk Marque
once the board disappeared.
Milk Marque is hoping to attract more than 80 per cent of dairy farmers, but
Mr Dare says the organisation can be viable if it gains as few as 15 per
cent. He is offering farmers contracts that enable them to leave the
co-operative on three set dates with a year's notice. If farmers leave with
three months' notice, they will be liable to pay a penalty equivalent to 2
per cent of their previous year's milk receipts  - or about  1/2 p a litre.
Mr Dare is committed to a cost-cutting programme at Milk Marque where he
hopes to trim transport costs to 1p a litre from 1.1p and keep overall costs
at 1.4p a litre for the next three years, compared with 1.5p this year, in
spite of inflation and the loss of some economies of scale.
In an effort to save on transport costs, Mr Dare will suggest that milk from
some farmers is collected every other day - not every day as at present. But
he stresses that this will be only for farmers who have additional storage
capacity for the extra milk.
Farmers outside England and Wales, for example from Scotland or France, will
be able to join Milk Marque, although they may have to pay extra transport
costs, says Mr Dare.
Milk Marque faces competition for farmers' milk in the free market next year
from dairy groups such as Northern Foods and Nestle. In an effort to
persuade producers to rally to Milk Marque, Mr Dare points to the risks of
tying their fortunes to a single dairy company.
For example, Express Dairies' share of the yoghurt market had fallen from
27.1 per cent in 1989 to 15.5 per cent last year, while that of Muller had
soared from 4.3 per cent to 17.8 per cent, he notes.
Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board's dairy products subsidiary, is to be
spun off before next April and Mr Dare says shares will probably go only to
current milk producers. Some former producers have threatened legal action
if they do not obtain shares, arguing that they have contributed to Dairy
Crest in the past through the milk price and capital levies.

COPPER closed higher on the LME after a break above Dollars 1,930 a tonne
for three-month metal, injecting stability into most other metals. Dealers
said buy stops were triggered around Dollars 1,935, with the market hitting
a high of Dollars 1,949, before prices eased. As usual, fundamentals took a
back seat in copper, with the market ignoring stocks at 15-year highs and
the lessening possibilities of stoppages in Peru and the US. Instead, nearby
supply tightness helped the market move up into a new Dollars 1,930 to
Dollars 1,950 range. Three-month ALUMINIUM was steady on the back of copper.
Strong resistance is expected above current levels, but good support is
emerging on dips, indicative of the recent slight improvement in sentiment.
Three-month NICKEL recovered from the morning's six-year low of Dollars
4,850 a tonne to register a Dollars 37.50 gain on the day. But further
advances will attract selling, as stocks are seen rising further following
yesterday's 1,368-tonne increase to a record 100,392 tonnes. Chicago WHEAT
was higher at midsession on concern about declines in crop production and
quality following excessive wet weather in the central plains.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine farmers protest
against economic policies

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF farmers yesterday converged on Buenos Aires' central Plaza de
Mayo to protest against government policies that they claim are driving all
but the largest farms into bankruptcy.
Cheered by passers by, tractors and pick-up trucks jammed the city's streets
as they made their way to the square - dominated by the presidential palace,
the economy ministry and the tax department - the targets of the farmers'
anger.
The protest is the culmination of months of agitation for a change in
government policy, which have so far fallen on deaf ears. Farmers are
demanding less taxation, subsidised loans and refinancing of their bank
loans of over USDollars 4bn.
However, there is little that President Carlos Menem or his economy
minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, can do to solve farmers' biggest problem -
subsidised output in the US and the European Community, which has steadily
driven international commodity prices down. To make matters worse, flooding
has covered huge expanses of the pampas.
The government has already eliminated hated export taxes and abolished taxes
on fuel and bank loans. Nevertheless, farmers complain they are still
burdened by excessive value added tax and punitive provincial government
taxes. Furthermore, an overvalued exchange rate is eroding their export
incomes while their costs continue rising.
One of the protesters, Mr Roberto Bafunda, who produces wheat, corn and
soyabeans on his small 50 hectare farm, said: 'We can't survive like this.
The small farmers are being driven out and the rich big ones are buying up
the land of the bankrupt.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recycling forecast to hold back
mined lead output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STEEP rise in production of secondary lead from recycled and scrap metal
will hold back output from the mines, according to the Economist
Intelligence Unit consultancy organisation.
It points out that secondary lead already has a 50.5 per cent share of total
western world production and output can be expected to grow by more than 27
per cent between 1992 and 1997, from 2.223m tonnes to 2.83m tonnes. This
would take its share of forecast total output in 1997 - 4.925m tonnes - to
57.5 per cent.
The EIU notes that, although lead and zinc are usually mined as co-products,
miners can pick projects that shift the lead/zinc balance in the way the
market indicates.
So it sees mine production of lead falling by more than 6 per cent from
2.317m tonnes in 1992 to 2.17m tonnes in 1997.
In contrast, mine production of zinc is forecast to rise marginally by 2 per
cent to 5.73m tonnes between 1992 and 1997. However, environmental pressures
will ensure more zinc is recovered from furnace dusts and the EIU expects
secondary zinc production to climb from 357,000 tonnes in 1992 to 395,000
tonnes in 1997. Total refined zinc output is predicted to rise from 5.435m
tonnes to 5.85m tonnes in that period.
The report suggests lead and zinc prices will recover in the years to 1997
but not regain earlier peaks. The London Metal Exchange cash settlement
price for lead will rally from under 18 cents a lb today to an average of 32
cents in 1997, it predicts. For zinc, the report forecasts rise from 43
cents to 62 cents a lb.
It says each metal has a strong core market that accounts for a growing
proportion of consumption: batteries for lead and galvanising for zinc. Net
exports of these metals to the West from the former communist bloc countries
'should be reduced to much more manageable proportions by 1995-97', it adds.
The EIU forecasts that average gross domestic product growth in member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
the five years to 1997 will grow at 2.3 per cent annually. Total zinc
consumption is predicted to rise by an annual average of 2.3 per cent and
that of lead by 2.5 per cent.
The report makes a strong plea for the LME not to be turned into 'a proper
futures market' with the consequent abandonment of the cash and three month
system of trading and all pretence of physical delivery. 'The LME has long
been the vehicle for orderly trade in base metals, without which chaos would
have reigned. To distance the LME from the physical trade now would be a
betrayal of the industries which increasingly rely on it both as an element
of stability and a help in the conduct of their day-to-day operations,' the
report adds.
Lead and Zinc to 1997: Pounds 175 or Dollars 365, from the EIU, 40 Duke
Street, London W1A 1DW, UK.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp industry not yet out of
the woods - Producers are still battered by over-supply and weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOD PULP producers have seen many lights at the end of their industry's
tunnel over the past three years. But instead of growing brighter, the
lights have each time faded away into the distance.
After so many false starts those producers still brave enough to make
predictions now acknowledge that a solid upturn is unlikely for at least
another six months. 'I don't think there's a lot of optimism for the balance
of this year,' says Mr John Sim, vice-president for pulp marketing at
Canadian Pacific Forest Products in Montreal.
Prices of northern softwood pulp are languishing around USDollars 460-480 a
tonne in North America, before the discounts of Dollars 40-50 a tonne that
have become standard practice in the industry.
Mr John Johnson, forest products analyst at Richardson Greenshields in
Vancouver, recently lowered his 1993 forecast from an average price of
Dollars 490 to Dollars 460. He has also cut his 1994 prediction from Dollars
590 to Dollars 550.
The pulp industry is being battered by both over-supply and weak demand.
Several projects, which were planned before the severity of the downturn
became apparent, are now on the point of being commissioned. A CDollars
1.3bn (Pounds 675m) hardwood pulp mill, jointly owned by Mitsubishi Trading
and Kanzaki Paper of Japan and Vancouver-based Crestbrook Forest Industries,
is set to come on stream in northern Alberta on September 1. The mill will
initially produce 750 tonnes a day, half its rated capacity.
The US, Chinese and Venezuelan owners of the Celgar bleached northern kraft
pulp mill in south-east British Columbia are also putting the finishing
touches to a project, which will more than double capacity to more than
1,200 tonnes a day.
Even bigger projects are on the drawing boards in Brazil and Indonesia,
awaiting the financing that could materialise once the market shows signs of
life. The projects in Indonesia could add 1.5m tonnes a year, or 7 per cent,
to world chemical market pulp capacity. While acknowledging that 'any new
pulp mill could depress the market', Mr Keith Fujieda, president of MC
Forest Products, a Mitsubishi subsidiary, says that 'we can reasonably sell
our product (from the new Alberta mill)'. Mr Fujieda says the mill will ship
mainly to customers in Japan, Europe, the US and possibly Korea.
On the demand side, producers have been frustrated to find improved
conditions in one market being offset by a deterioration in others. Paper
consumption in Germany and Japan has weakened markedly in recent months.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian mills'
shipments to Europe sank to 155,000 tonnes in May from 184,000 tonnes a year
earlier. Weak offshore markets have encouraged export-oriented mills in the
US and Canada to divert shipments to the more buoyant domestic market,
thereby holding down North American prices. Thus, Canadian mills' shipments
to the US climbed to 176,000 tonnes in May, from 174,000 tonnes a year
earlier and 155,000 in May 1991.
Despite the gloom, market forces are starting to tighten up the slack
between supply and demand.
Simpson Timber in the US and CP Forest are among the North American
producers that have permanently shut down some older, high-cost mills. Many
other companies have announced temporary production cuts. In Canada, the
operating rate has slid from an average of 93 per cent in the first five
months of 1992 to 85 per cent in January-May 1993. Latest estimates suggest
that the industry is now operating at less than three-quarters of capacity.
If the pressure on prices lasts much longer, more sweeping rationalisation
is likely. Record lumber prices, which enabled many forestry companies to
subsidise loss-making pulp operations, have come down markedly in recent
months. Mr Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York, says that the most
likely casualties of the coming shake-out are the older, inefficient mills
owned by industry giants such as Stora of Sweden, International Paper of the
US and the big eastern Canadian producers. Mills in high-currency countries,
such as Japan, are also vulnerable. These mills rely on imported fibre and
many do not meet the latest environmental standards. 'If the Japanese
currency wasn't so high, they'd be losing their shirts; they're already
losing both sleeves,' Mr Kirk says.
Least affected by further cuts are likely to be mills in British Columbia,
whose feedstock consists largely of chips from lumber manufacturers. Some of
these mills use no wood at all from raw logs.
The production cuts are having an effect. Canadian producers, who account
for more than a quarter of world market-pulp output, have lowered their
stocks from 43 days' supply in March to 37 days in May - though this is
still well above the 21 days held at this time last year. It is not yet
clear whether the decline in stocks is due to production cuts or to
paper-makers starting to rebuild depleted inventories in anticipation of
rising prices.
Pulp producers face another uncertainty when demand for paper products does
eventually improve. In previous upturns rising paper sales were matched by a
corresponding rise in demand for pulp. But an ever-growing proportion of
paper mills' raw material now comes from recycled material.
The pulp industry may thus find that not only has the recession been longer
than anyone expected, but that the recovery will be painfully slow.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Recruitement: Stupidity - and how to learn from it - What
matters is not how many mistakes you make, but the spirit in which you make
them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHY are we waiting . . . again?' is all that is written on the postcard
sent from Bristol. Even so, the Jobs column knows not only what it refers
to, but who the sender is.
The card is written in the same hand as the set of five, each asking just
'Why are we waiting?', which arrived at monthly intervals between the May
and the September of 1986. The sender called herself Amelia Bulstrode, which
is hardly the sort of name one forgets.
What she was asking about was the Laws of Organisational Stupidity, which
I'd previously promised to list in full only to let the next five months
pass without doing so. As enduring readers may recall, the laws describe
types of idiotic goings-on which seem to bedevil organisations of all kinds
everywhere, an example being Parkinson's First which states: Work expands to
fill the time available. And in 1986 there were a dozen laws in the canon.
Now, oddly enough, in March this year I again promised to give the full code
which, with the help of new examples sent by readers, had grown to 23. So I
pledged to list them 'chunk by chunk, spaced over the next few weeks'.
This time I've at least done rather better, managing to deal with 13 laws by
the end of last month. But the list has since gone no farther, and Amelia
Bulstrode presumably wants to hear about the other 10. If so, she's by no
means alone, because colleagues as well as myself have lately had less
subtle requests for the whole series.
The failure to finish the listing is due less to laziness than to a
development bound up with the nature of the laws. The idea behind them isn't
just to comfort frustrated high-achievers by showing that their sufferings
are shared by their counterparts the world over. Behind that lies the hope
of helping management researchers to trace the causes of the stupid
occurrences that so regularly snarl up organisations' attempts to be
effective.
Accordingly, each law is intended to describe a specific kind of idiocy
which is essentially different from any of the idiocies depicted by the
other laws in the code, and thus can be presumed also to have a different
cause which needs to be pinpointed. Take for instance Professor Jerry
Harvey's Abilene Paradox, one of the 13 already listed, which states: People
in groups agree on decisions which, as individuals, they know are stupid.
That seems different from Macaulay's Buck-shifter, also listed before,
ruling: Initiative declines with increasing ease of communications.
So until last month, there I was confidently setting out the supposedly
differently caused stupidities - which went perfectly well for the first 12
examples. But then came the 13th, and with it came trouble.
By contrast with the previous dozen, which had all been in the code for some
time, it was newly discovered. It is named after Harvard University's
Professor Chris Argyris who in his latest book* points out that much of the
counter-productive politicking that goes on in organisations is rooted in a
type of individual action which all of us have been *Knowledge for action.

learning to perform skilfully since before we could walk.
It is to respond to any problem that threatens to land us in hot water by
first finding a way to by-pass it, then covering up the by-pass, covering up
the cover-up . . . and so on. As a result, far from being solved, the
problem is not even admitted to exist. It becomes, in the professor's terms,
increasingly 'undiscussible'. Hence Argyris's Archetype which says: The more
threatening a problem to those responsible for solving it, the deeper it
will become ingrained under ramifying layers of camouflage.
The trouble was that, having discovered it, I realised that it destroyed the
idea that each law in the code denotes a separate kind of stupidity with its
own separate cause. For the Archetype accounts for several of the other
idiocies formulated as laws.
For example, the tendency to by-pass problems explains the Buck-shifter.
With high-speed communications, people faced with personally risky decisions
can more easily by-pass them by referring them to someone higher up. Much
the same applies to the Abilene tendency for people in groups to agree on
what they individually know are stupid decisions. It is explained by the
fact that the wiser courses of action which need to be taken are
undiscussible, since none of the group members dare broach them for fear of
losing their job.
That left me wondering how many more of the supposedly self-standing laws
were in fact mere effects of the Argyris rule. The answer, alas, is
certainly several, although I've not yet examined the implications deeply
enough to give a precise number.
Fortunately, however, there are some which clearly still stand alone. And
they're exemplified by one which also illustrates the debt the whole laws
project owes to readers' help.
Another postcard that arrived in 1986 came from one Peter Kelly in Dublin,
who proposed a law reading simply 'Errors breed'. But while they certainly
do so in some circumstances, there are clearly others in which errors merely
arise intermittently with no connection between them.
One thing that struck me as likely to explain the difference was the
American psychologist David McClelland's division of people into two broad
kinds. The first are those motivated by a need for positive achievement, who
tend to look on their errors as an opportunity to do better next time. The
others, motivated by fear of failure, are typically preoccupied by the need
to avoid making mistakes.
So, in my role as the self-appointed codifier, I extended the proposal into
what is now named Kelly's 'Katabolism' (a faulty life-support system that
kills the organism affected). The law says: Errors breed as concentration on
avoiding them increases.
What's more, it is true.
Anyone who doubts me need only consult psychologist Michael Frese of Giessen
University in Germany who besides having studied mistake-making in detail
has developed ways of much reducing the bad effects. His research suggests
that when people are put under pressure to avoid doing anything wrong, the
stress they feel on finding they've made an error tends to fluster them into
making more.
The remedy he proposes is to scrap training consisting of step-by-step
procedures which people are told to follow strictly and, if they do
something wrong, to call the instructors who will put things right before
again showing them what they should have done instead. His studies indicate
that it's better to set trainees tasks so complicated that they are bound to
make mistakes and, when they do, respond with 'Great - you can now learn
something really useful by finding out how to put things right yourself'.
The result, he finds, is not only that they tend to learn more complex
skills faster. No less important is that, although they make more mistakes
than people trained in the other way, their errors are far less likely to
have damaging consequences because they're better equipped to take
corrective action in good time.
Which said, the Jobs column is off on holiday. I hope to meet you all -
including Mrs Bulstrode - again on September 8.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Dealers on sidelines ahead of Bundesbank
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets went on hold yesterday following the recent
exchange rate mechanism battle.
Dealers were keeping their powder dry ahead of today's Bundesbank repurchase
agreement announcement and, more significantly, the key central Bank council
meeting tomorrow.
The announcement that the German inflation rate had only risen by 0.1 per
cent left markets looking puzzled. Some economists pointed out that with
three of the four west German regions announcing an increase of 0.2 per cent
in the cost of living and the fourth announcing a 0.1 per cent rise, the
overall number was hard to swallow.
Bund futures prices, which would normally have risen on the back of a figure
that was slightly more deflationary than expected, slipped back to close 10
pfennigs down at 96.18.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank said that today's repo would be variable and the
market was looking for a cut of about 10 basis points to 7.05 per cent as a
precursor to reductions in the official discount and Lombard rates tomorrow.
UK DEBT prices were softer along the yield curve and took no heart from the
latest CBI survey which painted a picture that under normal circumstances
the gilts market would have warmly welcomed.
The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial survey argued
that the strength of sterling and low business confidence should make the
government think about a cut in interest rates. That would be expected to
help short-dated gilts which respond to interest rate cuts.
The survey found that the balance of companies showing optimism about the
economic outlook fell to 11 per cent from 31 per cent in April and it
expected manufacturing jobs to fall by 40,000 in the third quarter.
Those views would normally have helped long-dated maturities, which thrive
in a climate of low inflationary pressures.
Nevertheless, sterling retraced Monday's upward move and traders were
holding back ahead of today's Pounds 3.25bn gilts auction, which has
generated some nervousness because analysts have said the eight-year
maturity is too long-dated to appeal to banks and building societies and too
short-dated to attract overseas buyers.
FRENCH paper was steady as the market awaited the Bundesbank repo for
indications about the prospect and size of an official German rate cut
tomorrow and the recent speculative attacks faded away.
French call money shot up to an offered rate of 11 per cent by
mid-afternoon, although analysts said the rate might be artificially high as
call money was mostly traded in the morning.
Short-dated maturities were marginally firmer on hopes of further monetary
easing.
The 10-year OAT futures contract for September eased 4 centimes to 120.20,
slightly nervous ahead of key unemployment figures on Friday which are
expected to show a rise to about 11.6 per cent from 11.5 per cent.
SPANISH government bonds gained slightly as further falls for the peseta
against the D-Mark fuelled hopes that the currency would have to be floated,
allowing rates to be cut.
The peseta was hit by unconfirmed rumours that unemployment in the second
quarter was above 22 per cent against 21.7 per cent in the first quarter.
Unemployment figures are due this week and some economists expect the rate
to have risen to at least 23 per cent.
PORTUGUESE bonds rose slightly on hopes that money rates would ease and on
expectations that the Bundesbank would cut key rates on Thursday.
The Bank of Portugal auctioned Es9bn of eight-day certificates at an average
rate of 13.5 per cent to absorb money market liquidity.
TRADING was subdued on US Treasury markets yesterday, with prices
flat-to-lower across the board after the afternoon auction of new two-year
government securities.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 105
25/32 , yielding 6.672 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield 4.192
per cent.
Prices remained in a narrow trading range just below opening values.
Attention was firmly focused on the afternoon sale of Dollars 16bn two-year
notes, the market's first big auction in more than a month. Although dealers
had hoped the auction would go well, demand proved disappointingly weak,
with the two-years sold at a yield of 4.26 per cent. This was above
expectations.
The day's economic news - a small drop in the July Conference Board consumer
confidence index and a 2.4 per cent rise in weekly store sales as reported
by the Johnson Redbook survey - was mixed for bonds, and had little impact
upon sentiment.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Bonds: ERM worries stimulate interest in
Euroyen issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR new Euroyen issues were launched yesterday as investors steered clear
of European bond markets due to worries about the fate of the exchange rate
mechanism.
Three of the four issues were straight bond issues, bringing the volume of
fixed-rate debt in the sector to Y110bn so far this week.
Most of the paper was targeted at investors in Japan or south-east Asia, but
some dealers noted a pick-up in interest among European investors.
Mitsubishi Corporation Finance launched a Y20bn three-year deal which met
demand in both Europe and Asia Pacific, according to lead manager Merrill
Lynch. Tokyu Land issued Y30bn of four-year bonds via Yamaichi
International, which were pre-placed in Asia Pacific, while Nikko's Y30bn
offering for China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic)
was targeted at investors in south-east Asia, who understand the credit,
according to the lead manager. The mandate for the deal was awarded several
weeks ago, and sold out prior to its official launch.
Elsewhere, the State Bank of South Australia launched an ADollars 100m issue
of 6 3/4 per cent bonds due 1998 via Hambros Bank. Volume in the sector has
been low recently, partly as a result of a fall in the number of maturing
deals providing reinvestment flows, which will drop further next month.
The deal was offered at a spread of 31 basis points over the comparable
government bonds yield, but tightened to 29 basis points.
The Mortgage Bank of Denmark launched a large Dkr750m five-year deal via
Morgan Stanley. At the end of trading, the deal was quoted at 99.80, above

In the Swiss market, three Japanese companies launched equity-linked deals

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Equities: Return of Indian companies wins
investor plaudits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA has already won the sobriquet of 'jewel' in the emerging markets
portfolio, as the international investor community has followed the Indian
government's economic liberalisation programme with interest.
Two Indian companies have turned to the international capital market with
equity or equity-linked offerings recently, breaking a dry spell of several
months. Market specialists attribute the absence of Indian international
equity offerings since December to several factors: primarily on the
widespread disappointment over earlier international equity issues, as well
as concern over the political situation, and in particular the religious
riots which left hundreds dead.
Investor response to the latest offerings appears positive. Hindalco
Industries, an aluminium producer, launched a successful Dollars 72m issue
of Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), with each GDR representing one equity
share and one half warrant. It marks the first time that an Indian company
has done a US dollar warrant deal, and the combined GDR-warrant unit was
trading at an equivalent premium of 16.3 per cent to the launch price
yesterday.
Meanwhile, Essar Gujarat, the Indian iron company, is launching the first
Indian Eurodollar convertible bond, and hopes to raise Dollars 60m with a
five-year convertible issue which will be priced next week. The indicated
coupon is 5.5 to 6 per cent, and there is a three-year put option at par so
that if the share price does not pick up investors get their money back.
Some international investors said they liked the downside protection offered
by a convertible bond structure. Those who participated in last year's
international equity offerings by Indian companies - Reliance Industries and
Grasim - were disappointed to see the share price of those two companies
languish after the international offering.
If these two deals are seen to be well-managed and successful, investment
bankers claim it should go some way to restoring investor confidence in the
Indian market.
Investor interest has been stimulated in the last couple of years by the
government's economic restructuring and liberalisation programme.
'It's a huge economy, the economic fundamentals are improving, and there are
some large well-managed companies; furthermore, the stock market is
well-developed, and it's not like China where everything is controlled,'
said one fund manager.
Against the relatively rosy economic picture, international investors point
out that price-earnings ratios of around 20 do not compare favourably with
other Asian markets. 'Multiples of around 20 mean it is very expensive, but
there are still some attractive companies,' said one emerging markets fund
manager.
Of more concern is the political background and religious violence. '(Prime
minister) Rao has gone faster than most people thought he would, but not as
fast as they would have liked,' said one fund manager. His main concern is
that the economic reforms could slow down once the implications of
privatisation and tougher international competition are more fully
appreciated.
'The religious violence does make investors nervous,' says one fund manager,
'Most people are trying to forget about massacres and are looking at the
economy instead.'
The occasional closure of the stock market - whether as a result of violence
or financial skulduggery - is also an irritation in the view of
international investors, though most admit that, compared with other Third
World or developing countries, India's stock market is 'relatively
well-developed'.

<TEXT>
JAPAN Tobacco, the government-owned tobacco group, has applied for listing
on the Tokyo stock exchange ahead of a partial flotation scheduled for early
next year.
Japan Tobacco was due to be floated last year, along with East Japan Rail.
The issues were postponed following a period of prolonged weakness for the
Tokyo stock market.
Japan Tobacco controls 83 per cent of the Y3,000bn (Dollars 28bn) domestic
tobacco market. For the year to March, its pre-tax profits dipped 11.1 per
cent to Y100.4bn on sales little changed at Y2,761.7bn.
Mr Shigeru Mizuno, president of Japan Tobacco, said the company was looking
to expand its exports and to diversify.
In the initial listing, 33 per cent of the company's outstanding shares will
be offered. Ahead of the listing, one-third of the tranche will be auctioned
as a means of making an orderly secondary market.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, said the ministry would monitor
developments on the stock market following JT's listing application. He
denied the government was about to sell its remaining shares in Nippon
Telephone and Telegraph.

AECI, South Africa's largest chemicals group in which Imperial Chemical
Industries of the UK has a 38 per cent stake, reports a 22 per cent increase
in earnings per share for the six months to June.
Turnover rose 6 per cent to R2.69bn (Dollars 770m), with domestic sales up 9
per cent and export revenues falling 14 per cent. Restructuring allowed
margins to be broadly maintained, and net trading profit was 9 per cent
higher at R162m.
Net profit, before R14m in extraordinary income from a change in the tax
rate, was R61m, against R50m. Earnings per share rose to 39 cents from 32
cents. The dividend is being maintained at 18 cents.
Discussions are under way with ICI 'with a view to strengthening the linkage
between AECI and ICI in businesses where AECI has a global market position'.
The outcome of these talks will be announced by the end of the third
quarter.
AECI expects its earnings growth, before abnormal items, to be maintained in
the current six months, provided the political situation does not
deteriorate further and the agricultural sector enjoys reasonable summer
rains.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Statoil up slightly despite low
crude prices

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a slight
increase in first-half net profit in the opening half of 1993, against a
background of difficult market conditions.
Net profits were NKr1.9bn (Dollars 259m), against NKr1.8bn a year ago. The
group has had to battle against lower average oil prices, a fall in equity
crude oil production, and a NKr200m charge against accounts.
Statoil warned of a lower second-half operating profit on the basis of
current crude oil prices, and a continued fall in crude production from the
giant Statfjord field.
First-half operating profit fell to NKr6.6bn from NKr7bn on revenues of
NKr42.6bn, against NKr40.4bn. Statoil said Brent blend reference crude
averaged Dollars 18.22 per barrel in the first half, down from Dollars 19
last year, as equity crude production slipped to 75m barrels from 78m.
'The start of the second half-year has been characterised by declining oil
prices and considerable uncertainty about price development for crude oil,
refined oil products and petrochemicals,' Statoil said.
Helped by a stronger dollar-krone exchange rate and a NKr311m reduction in
costs, to NKr8.49bn, exploration and production was the main reason for the
improvement in first-half operating profit, to NKr5bn from NKr4.8bn.
In the natural gas division, operating profit fell to NKr1.6bn from NKr2bn
due to lower revenue from gas transport as volumes fell and tariff prices
were adjusted.
In refining and marketing, operating profit dipped to NKr472m from NKr476m
against tougher marketing competition but with improved refining margins.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: State sell-off gives Viag energy
to expand - Bavaria's Bayernwerk stake sale appears to favour the buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision last weekend by the German state of Bavaria to sell its
majority stake in Bayernwerk, the country's third-largest utility, to the
Viag energy-based conglomerate, finally cements the close relationship
between the two companies.
Until now, Viag has held 39 per cent of Bayernwerk, and Bayernwerk, a 24.9
per cent stake in Viag. As part of the Bavarian government's privatisation
plans, it will now swap its stake in Bayernwerk for a 25.1 per cent stake in
Viag, plus DM1bn (Dollars 585m). Viag will move its headquarters from Bonn
to Munich.
The merger appears to favour Viag, which has been trying to obtain the
Bayernwerk stake for some time. It ends, for instance, the the cross-share
structure which created some uncertainty in the markets. When the
announcement was made last Friday, Viag's shares climbed more than 1 per
cent, by DM6 to DM392.50.
It also gives Viag access to Bayernwerk's energy base. Until now Viag's
energy division depended on Bayernwerk supplies for as much as 60 per cent
of needs. This ratio is expected to rise to 80 per cent once the merger is
completed.
Viag could also use the merger to expand its energy base into eastern
Germany. Bayernwerk, along with the country's two largest utilities, RWE
Energie, and PreussenElektra, the 100 per cent-owned electricity division of
Veba, the country's other large energy-based conglomerate, are already
investing heavily in power generation in eastern Germany.
These three utilities monopolise Veag, eastern Germany's biggest utility,
which controls the high-voltage grid in the region. Along with the country's
smaller five utilities, they are now bidding for Veag, which is being sold
by the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising
eastern German industry.
They are also engaged in buying out their 51 per cent stakes in eastern
Germany's 15 regional utilities, which the Treuhand is privatising.
The deal with Bayernwerk gives Viag the potential to compete with RWE
Energie and Veba, one analyst said. However, he added that the close,
consensual relationship among Germany's utilities 'does not encourage
competition'.
It depends on what Mr Jochen Holzer, chairman of Viag and Bayernwerk,
chooses to do with the acquisition, he said. Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, Viag's
management board chairman, said Bayernwerk would be responsible for all
energy-related activities, and Viag would run the other sectors.
News of the merger comes at a time when Viag's aluminium and steel divisions
are at a cyclical low. Last year, Viag's turnover was DM24.3bn, and
Bayernwerk's, DM6.64bn.
However, some analysts question why Viag is planning to raise its nominal
capital by one-third instead of paying cash for Bayernwerk. Viag has cash of
more than DM2.92bn on its balance sheet, and debt and loans totalling
DM3.56bn. Bayernwerk has cash on its balance sheet of over DM2.5bn, and debt
of only DM400m.
Bayernwerk and the state of Bavaria will reap some benefits from this
merger. The utilities company will have access to a more diverse
conglomerate, and the merger will effectively remove Bayernwerk from the
state sector.
Through this first large-scale privatisation, Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's
prime minister, has confirmed his determination to press ahead with
unshackling Bavarian business. Further privatisations of between DM2bn and
DM3bn are expected.
In doing so, he hopes to attract to Bavaria diverse and large conglomerates,
such as Viag, and use them to restructure the state's industrial base.

BAVARIA is to sell its 45 per cent stake in the lossmaking Maxhutte, a local
steel manufacturer. Finance ministry officials said negotiations with two
prospective buyers were under way, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
The Bavarian government hopes to sell its stake by next January.
Potential buyers include Mr Max Aicher, chairman of the board at Maxhutte
and owner of a steel and construction enterprise bearing his name.
The other potential buyer is Mr Manfred Kuhnlein, manager of a pipe
manufacturing company in Nuremberg. Mr Kuhnlein has plans to turn the
steelworks into a recycling plant for cars.
Maxhutte was saved from bankruptcy in 1987 when Klockner, the German
steelmaker, sold it to the Bavarian state. Other German steelmakers,
including Thyssen and Krupp, also took shares in the company, which produces
316,000 tonnes of rails, pipelines and steel rods per year.
Maxhutte made a DM15m (Dollars 8.77m) loss in 1992 on sales of DM350m. It
has 1,700 employees, down from the 4,000 who worked there before the
bankruptcy proceedings.
Company officials said Thyssen and Krupp had expressed a willingness to sell
their stakes.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Broker emerges from retailer's
umbrella - Dean Witter Discover is prospering in its independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEAN Witter Discover, the securities brokerage and credit services company,
is enjoying new-found independence after 12 years as a subsidiary of Sears,
Roebuck, the large US retailer.
Last week, the company, which went public in February, announced a record
profit of Dollars 157m for the second quarter, which pushed its stock up to
Dollars 38 5/8 , close to its high.
The decoupling of Dean Witter from Sears, part of a strategy by the retailer
to concentrate on its core businesses, began in February when 20 per cent of
the company was sold to investors via an initial public offering.
Four months later, the remaining 80 per cent was distributed to Sears
shareholders in the form of a dividend, and on July 1 Dean Witter Discover
began life as a 100 per cent publicly-owned company.
Dean Witter has emerged from under the Sears umbrella as a curious, but
highly profitable, hybrid. A company with a big presence in the retail
stockbroking and asset management that happens to be the largest single
issuer of credit cards in the US.
Dean Witter's credit services division, through its Discover credit card,
last year contributed more than half the company's annual profit of Dollars
410.5m. At the end of 1992, the Discover card was the largest single-issuer
credit card in the US with 39m members.
It ranked second (after Citibank) in outstanding receivables, and third
(after American Express and AT&amp;T) in dollar transaction volume.
The Discover card, launched nationally in 1986, was initially seen by many
industry observers as a foolhardy diversification by Sears.
At the time, says Mr Philip Purcell, Dean Witter's chairman and chief
executive, 'everybody thought that it was a mistake'.
Sears was determined to expand its financial services operations, and
invested Dollars 200m, after-tax, in Discover over the first two years.
By the third year, it was producing a profit. The decision to aim the card
at value-conscious consumers and build a large base of merchants who took
the card (1.7m as of 1992), quickly paid off. The card attracted 6m holders
in each of its first two years.
New cardholder growth has slowed, most notably last year, when only 800,000
net new accounts were reported. The sharp drop has concerned analysts and
investors.
However, Mr Purcell blames the slowdown on two exceptional factors.
First, the mailing of pre-approved applications to potential customers was
halted for nine months last year because of a mistake in the mailing
process. Second, Dean Witter is purging inactive accounts to save servicing
costs, a move which accounted for 700,000 cardholders last year.
Mr Purcell says account growth will improve this year, and pick up in 1995
when the purging of inactive accounts is complete.
Dean Witter is trying to cut its Discover costs as competition between card
issuers becomes hotter than ever.
'I think there are things going on in the market place that we are concerned
about. You have now got a number of competitors offering value-oriented
products,' Mr Purcell admits.
The company has responded by lowering the interest rate it charges favoured
customers, by targeting mailings more efficiently, and by building its
merchant base further. As a result margins have been squeezed. On the
positive side, the move to variable interest rates on cards means the
company has access to cheaper variable funding.
Dean Witter plans to issue its own Visa card, called Prime Option. However,
those plans are foundering on opposition from Visa, which disputes Dean
Witter's right to issue Visa cards under its Discover label.
The dispute rests in the courts, and Dean Witter knows it is in a legal
battle that could drag on for years.
'They're trying to keep us out of the business, we're trying to get in the
business. We're in a hurry, they're not. As long as they can drag the
process out, they win,' Mr Purcell says.
On the securities side, Dean Witter continues to consolidate its position as
a retail broker with a strong asset management business. The firm has
Dollars 65bn of client assets under its control, and continuous fee income
from managing that money covers 71 per cent of the brokerage's fixed costs.
Its focus on broking, and selling the retail customer financial products
such as mutual funds, plus its decision to steer clear of more volatile
businesses such as proprietary trading and investment banking, means Dean
Witter's revenue growth has been the most consistent of any Wall Street
securities house.
In 1990, for example, the firm posted a hefty profit and a 19 per cent
return on equity while the rest of the industry racked up large losses.
Although Mr Purcell says running two businesses as different as securities
broking and credit services is not a strain on management, some observers
worry that if a serious problem develops in one business, it could hurt the
other.
Mr Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical in
New York, cautions: 'There is no commonality between securities brokerage
and credit cards, and one management is running two businesses, which has
got firms into trouble before. I see two disparate organisations as a
possible Achilles heel.'
In spite of these concerns, industry analysts are upbeat about Dean Witter's
immediate prospects, particularly while the boom in asset management and
retail broking lasts.
However, now that it is no longer part of Sears, Dean Witter is finding its
own funds, and its businesses are expensive to run. Sears was keen to sell
because financing the credit card business was increasingly costly.
Mr Flanagan says: 'Now that it's on its own, the company is aggressively
securitising its (credit card) receivables. Plus, continued growth in
managed assets requires continued growth in reserves, and thus capital,
which will come from public markets.'
Analysts do not envisage any problem in that department, with sentiment
about the company among the investment community still strong.
On the debt side, financing should be available, because Dean Witter's debt
ratings have improved since it went public.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: ITC ruling batters US steel
group share price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel unit of USX, yesterday
plunged Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after an International Trade
Commission decision on foreign competition turned out less favourable to US
producers than expected.
The ITC rejected about half the Commerce Department's penalties against
foreign steel producers, and said 'dumped' and subsidised steel had not
injured American producers. The US steel industry was disappointed with the
ruling, which followed the department's assesment in June that foreign
companies were importing products at rates below fair market value.
The ITC decision came as USX-US Steel reported a second-quarter net loss of
Dollars 333m, or Dollars 5.66 cents a share. This included an after-tax
charge of Dollars 403m related to anti-trust litigation against its former
railway subsidiary, the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad.
A year earlier, the company had restated net income of Dollars 2m, or 3
cents a share.
Stripping out the one-time charge, the company said operating income rose to
Dollars 56m from a restated Dollars 34m a year earlier.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX Corporation, the consolidated parent
company, attributed the improvement of its steel group to firmer industry
conditions. Sales in the quarter rose to Dollars 1.43bn from Dollars 1.27bn.
For the six months, the steel group had a net loss of Dollars 320m, or
Dollars 5.49, against a deficit of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 26.03.
LTV, the US steel group which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, says a US appeals court has ruled in its favour, upholding a
lower court ruling in a lawsuit against USX's former Bessemer and Lake Erie
Railroad unit.
The award stems from a 1982 lawsuit charging that some railroads had
monopolised dock handling and inland transportation of iron ore to steel
mills.

ASARCO, the US integrated copper producer, lost Dollars 24.1m, or 58 cents
per share, in the second quarter after production problems at its
recently-expanded Arizona mines and processing plants led to a fall in
output.
The company also continued to be hit by declining base metals prices.
Asarco earned Dollars 4.4m, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter of
1992. Sales were Dollars 416.6m, against Dollars 487.7m last year.
For the six months to June 30, Asarco reported a loss of Dollars 55m, or
Dollars 1.32, down from Dollars 10.8m, or Dollars 1.30. Sales for the first
half were Dollars 875.6m, down from Dollars 946.6m last year.
During the quarter the company's average realised price for copper fell 18
cents from a year-ago to 85 cents per pound, with lead and zinc prices also
lower. Its average realised price for silver rose 10 cents to Dollars 4.21
per ounce, and for gold, Dollars 10.45 to Dollars 374.39 per ounce.
In addition to lower prices, Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said earnings
were hit by the shutdown of the Company's Troy silver/copper mine in Montana
and higher costs and lower production rates at its Arizona copper
properties.
He said rains which flooded the Ray mine in the first quarter continue to
dilute the solutions from which copper is extracted, reducing second-quarter
copper cathode production by 3m pounds.

QUEBECOR PRINTING, the biggest subsidiary of the Quebecor publishing group,
is buying 80 per cent of Fecomme, a Paris-based commercial offset printer,
for USDollars 14m. Fecomme has annual sales of Dollars 40m and three
printing plants.
This is Quebecor Printing's second attempt to gain a European foothold, and
the company says it plans further acquisitions.
Quebecor Printing is North America's second-largest commercial printer and
recently expanded into Mexico.
Sears Canada, the second-biggest retailer in Canada, reduced its losses in
the second quarter. But the company expects to be in the black by year-end,
despite the sluggish Ontario market.
The second quarter loss was CDollars 18.9m (USDollars 14.8m), or 20 cents a
share, against a deficit of CDollars 29.2m, or 34 cents, on revenues of
CDollars 892m, down 4.5 per cent.

ATLANTIC Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based energy group, reported a
fall in second-quarter net income to Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.67 a share,
from Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.91, a year ago. It blamed pressure on
margins in its downstream oil and gas business and chemicals.
The figures include a net credit of Dollars 48m reflecting gains from the
sale of oil and gas properties, compared with a Dollars 65m special credit
in the 1992 quarter.
Refining, marketing and transportation earnings fell from Dollars 162m to
Dollars 129m. Earnings from chemicals dropped to Dollars 9m, from Dollars
24m last time, before the benefit from the Dollars 56m sale of a South
Korean joint venture by Arco Chemical, an 83 per cent-owned subsidiary.
Higher natural gas prices, though, helped push exploration and production
earnings to Dollars 160m before the gain on disposals, from Dollars 143m.
First-half net income was up year-on-year, from Dollars 489m in 1992 (before
a Dollars 392m for a change in accounting policy) to Dollars 531m.
Unocal, also based in Los Angeles, reported second-quarter net earnings of
Dollars 88m, or 33 cents a share, up from Dollars 66m, or 28 cents a year
before.
Excluding the effect of accounting changes and other special items,
first-half net earnings were up from Dollars 76m to Dollars 186m.

NOVELL, the US computer software company, warned that third-quarter European
sales were weaker than it had anticipated and it expected earnings per share
for the period to be flat relative to 1992.
Analysts had expected earnings per share of around 27 cents, but some cut
their forecasts to around 23 cents, against the 21 cents the company
registered in the third quarter of last year.
Novell, which is based in Utah and specialises in software to link computers
in local area networks, recently acquired Unix System Laboratories from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
It said that because of the European weakness it expected total
third-quarter revenue, including about Dollars 8m from Unix System
Laboratories, to be roughly flat with its second quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EARNINGS at American Express, the US travel and financial services group,
rose sharply in the second quarter. The group was lifted by a cut of
one-third in its provisions for credit losses and strong revenues generated
by its Lehman Brothers securities arm.
Post-tax profits rose 34.1 per cent to Dollars 416m, or 83 cents a share, up
from Dollars 310m, or 63 cents, a year ago. For the first half, net income
rose to Dollars 659m from Dollars 584m.
Travel-related services saw a rise in net income to Dollars 234m, from
Dollars 124m, as provisions for losses and claims fell to Dollars 394m, from
Dollars 600m.
The company said the decline, which was attributable mainly to its lending
rather than its charge card operations, was due to improved credit
management and portfolio restructuring.
Revenues from travel-related services fell, due to discount rate reductions
and a fall in the number of cards in use, though this was partially offset
by an increase in the volume of business billed to each cardholder.
At the end of the second quarter there were 34m cards in issue, down from
35.6m a year ago. Business billed to these cards amounted to Dollars 31m
during the quarter, up from Dollars 29m, with a rise in US business
offsetting a slight decline elsewhere.
Lehman Brothers, which American Express will continue to own after the
expected completion of the sale this weekend of the Shearson retail broking
business, returned after-tax earnings of Dollars 95m, after a loss of
Dollars 24m in the same period in 1992.
Commission and market-making income were up, while investment banking
revenues fell to Dollars 208m from Dollars 245m. Shearson made net profits
of Dollars Dollars 26.5m in the quarter, down from Dollars 28m a year
before.

loss worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Data General fell yesterday after the US minicomputer manufacturer
announced it had fallen further into the red during its third quarter.
The company lost Dollars 16.4m, or 47 cents a share, between April and June,
against a Dollars 11.7m loss in the same period of 1992 and a Dollars 7.6m
loss in the first three months of this year.
The latest losses were more than twice as large as analysts had expected,
pushing Data General shares Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 8 1/2 at the close
on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, blamed 'the weak worldwide
economy, particularly in the European marketplace, and industry-wide
competitive pricing pressures' for the poor results.
Overall revenues during the quarter totalled Dollars 252.4m, down from
Dollars 259.2m, although the decline was entirely due to the negative impact
of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Revenues from traditional proprietary minicomputer products continued to
decline. The company, however, is shifting away from proprietary products to
open systems based upon industry standards. But once again, strong sales of
its open systems products failed to stem the losses.
Mr Skates said the success of the open systems line of products reinforced
their belief the open systems strategy was correct.

TENNECO, the US conglomerate which has been extensively restructuring,
yesterday reported more than doubled second-quarter earnings from continuing
operations, but net income fell 28 per cent compared to the same period of
1992.
The figures were towards the low end of analysts' expectations, and Tenneco
shares fell Dollars 2 1/2 to close at Dollars 48 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Income from continuing operations totalled Dollars 111m, or 63 cents a
share, against Dollars 50m, or 32 cents, in the same period of last year, on
sales of Dollars 3.48bn, compared with Dollars 3.43bn.
Net income totalled Dollars 88m, or 50 cents, after a Dollars 23m, or 13
cents, extraordinary loss. That was down from Dollars 123m, or 84 cents, in
the same period last year, while operating income was slightly ahead at
Dollars 303m, compared with Dollars 296m.
The J I Case agricultural and construction equipment unit reported operating
income of Dollars 59m, up Dollars 48m from the same period last year, while
revenues dipped slightly to Dollars 1.1bn. The company attributed the
improvement to 'better margins as a result of a richer product mix, Case's
value-based pricing strategy, strong manufacturing performance and operating
cost reductions'.
For the six months, Tenneco reported net income of Dollars 162m, or 96
cents, against a loss of Dollars 543m, or Dollars 3.87, after accounting
changes in the same period of last year.

operating results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IBM, which yesterday announced an Dollars 8.9bn pre-tax restructuring charge
to cover job losses and plant cutbacks, also reported its second-quarter
operating results, including a net loss of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents a share,
before special items, write Martin Dickson and Louise Kehoe. That compared
to earnings of Dollars 734m, or Dollars 1.29, a year earlier. Revenues
totalled Dollars 15.5bn, down 4.3 per cent on the year-ago period.
The restructuring charge worked through at Dollars 8bn after tax and turned
the net loss to one of Dollars 8bn, or Dollars 14.10 a share.
IBM said its sales of computer equipment fell 12.9 per cent to Dollars
7.5bn, while its revenues from other sources rose 5.4 per cent to Dollars
8bn.
Software revenues rose 1.2 per cent to Dollars 2.72bn from Dollars 2.68bn.
Revenues from maintenance contracts fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn from
Dollars 1.90bn.
Service revenues were up strongly by 26.6 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn from
Dollars 1.86bn. Rentals and financing revenues fell 6.3 per cent to Dollars
1.07bn from Dollars 1.14 bn.
The company's important mainframe computer business saw sales decline on a
year-on-year basis, but the rate of decline was less than in the first
quarter.
Mainframe revenues in the second quarter were significantly above the first
quarter.
IBM's storage products business also declined, compared to the previous
year.
But the company said its personal computer and workstation businesses
continued to do well.
IBM said customers had responded well to new high end models of its AS/400
computers which it began shipping in the quarter.
AS/400 revenues had fallen in the quarter, compared to a year ago, but the
rate of decline was less than in the first quarter.
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman, said the overall gross margin remained stable for
the third consecutive quarter. It was 'far too early to declare victory on
that front, but its an encouraging sign,' he added.
For the six months, IBM recorded a net loss before restructuring charges of
Dollars 325m, or 58 cents share, compared to earnings of Dollars 1.4bn, or
Dollars 2.41, a year ago. Revenues fell 5.6 per cent to Dollars 28.6bn.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gerstner sees no place for a
'vision' at IBM - Chairman says priority is to get the company 'rightsized'
as soon as possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, said yesterday:
'Rightsizing IBM as quickly as possible, to restore the company to
profitability is my number one priority.'
In his first substantive public comments since joining the troubled computer
company on April 1, Mr Gerstner made clear that he had no 'grand master
strategy' to turn IBM around.
'There has been a lot of speculation that I'm going to deliver a 'vision' of
(the future of) IBM,' he said.
'The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision. What IBM needs right now is
a series of very tough-minded, market-driven (and) highly effective
strategies that deliver performance in the marketplace, and shareholder
value.'
IBM's primary problem is its cost structure, Mr Gerstner stressed at press
conferences in New York after presenting his company's results.
'In the last three months we have all been focused on getting that problem
behind us, of getting rightsized as quickly as possible,' he said.
'The management team feels that we need to get this (restructuring) behind
us as fast as we can.
'IBM's problem is very simple. We sell about Dollars 65bn worth of products
per year. At the end of the day we don't make any money.
'We don't have a problem with our products, our services or our technology -
we have a problem with our cost structure.
'My second priority for the company is to win the battle in the customer's
premises,' Mr Gerstner continued.
'Our prices have become more competitive and our technology is the best in
the industry, but we do not have a monopoly.' IBM must intensify its
competitiveness, he said.
Identifying which products and technologies represent the best prospects for
growth, comes third on Mr Gerstner's list, although he mentioned
microelectronics and multimedia as two areas that have his attention.
IBM would not hesitate to pull out of segments of the computer market in
which it was not either a technology leader or making profits, Mr Gerstner
said.
'Nowhere in any of our minds, certainly not mine, is there a view that IBM's
strategy is to be all things to all people, and to participate in all
elements of the information technology business,' he said. 'We are not in
any way pursuing that as an objective.'
Employee morale was a serious concern, Mr Gerstner said. Morale had suffered
as a result of continuing lay-offs and losses, the chairman acknowledged.
'Morale is not good in parts of the company, we have got to get behind this
Chinese water torture we are going through,' he said.
However, in spite of the attention that has been given to whether Mr
Gerstner will restructure IBM's management, he expressed little interest in
the subject.
'I'm spending a lot of time on customer issues, on technologies, on
employees and the economics of the business, and I don't really care what
committees we have.
'Process is not what we're going to talk about. Performance is what we are
going to talk about.
'We will never stop fixing IBM. Because of the nature of the business, we
will be constantly renewing this organisation and our challenge is to get
that renewal process continuous without bumps and starts.
'That is the requirement of any company in the '90s, but more so in the
information technology industry where the pace of change is so rapid.'

The Reichmanns lost control of O&amp;Y Developments early this year when it was

The management and leasing operation was spun off into O&amp;Y Properties.
Mr Philip Reichmann, Albert Reichmann's 35-year-old son, and Frank Hauer,
his 34-year-old son-in-law are buying 90 per cent of O&amp;Y Properties from the

WEAK BASE metal prices pushed Cominco into losses for the second quarter and
first half of 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The company said further efforts were being made to reduce operating costs.
The second-quarter loss was CDollars 16.3m (USDollars 12.7m), or 22 cents a
share, including a CDollars 31.6m gain on the spin-off of Cominco
Fertilisers. This compared with profit of CDollars 18.1m, or 22 cents, a
year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 225m from CDollars 416m. The first half
loss was CDollars 53.1m or 69 cents, compared with profit of CDollars 13.2m,
or 15 cents, on sales of CDollars 517m, against CDollars 746m.
Second-quarter mining and metals sales were off 24 per cent due to lower
prices and also the temporary shutdown of the Trail lead smelter.

GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber unveiled second-quarter profits yesterday of Dollars
137.6m, the second best result in the company's history. It was boosted by
lower expenses, increased US tyre sales and improved earnings from its
Brazil operations. In the same quarter a year ago, Goodyear earned Dollars
106.9m.
The latest quarter included two exceptional items: a Dollars 14.6m charge to
cover the early retirement of Dollars 290m in debt, and a gain of Dollars
7.9m from an asset sale.
The strong second-quarter results suggest Goodyear has continued to gain
market share against its main European and Japanese rivals, Michelin,
Continental and Bridgestone/Firestone, despite a generally weak tyre market.
Although Goodyear's total worldwide sales of Dollars 3bn in the second
quarter were down slightly from Dollars 3.1bn in 1992, the company said
sales were actually up 1.5 per cent if last year's contribution from the
now-divested films and polyester resin businesses is excluded.
Goodyear, the only surviving large US-owned tyre group, attributed its
higher earnings to several factors, among them an improvement in margins in
the US, higher margins in Brazil following price increases and production
efficiencies and lower selling, administrative and general expenses (both in
total dollars and as a percentage of sales). It also benefited from lower
interest expense and tax rates.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said: 'Worldwide tyre unit sales were up 2.3 per
cent in the quarter and 5.4 per cent in the half, led by gains in the US
market.'
The results had little impact on Goodyear's share price, primarily because
the company warned the market of its improved performance late last month.
Just before midday Goodyear shares were up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 43 1/4 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM aims to save Dollars 4bn
with job and capacity cuts
</HEADLINE>

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines suffered losses of more than Dollars 8bn in
its second quarter, after pre-tax charges of Dollars 8.9bn to cover a huge
reduction in its workforce and cuts in manufacturing capacity.
The company also reduced its quarterly dividend by more than half to 25
cents per share from 54 cents.
The charges cover 35,000 job cuts, in addition to the 50,000 employees who
have already, or will, leave the company this year, through voluntary and
involuntary redundancies.
Future workforce reductions will be 'heavily weighted toward positions
outside of the US,' the company said.
Along with cuts in manufacturing capacity and office space, the reductions
will result in savings of Dollars 4bn annually. Of the pre-tax restructuring
charge, Dollars 6bn will be for employee reductions and Dollars 2.9bn to
reduce capacity, office space and related expenses.
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said the second-quarter
charges could be the last in a series of big write-offs.
'If our current view of future industry revenue and demand proves incorrect,
we will have to take further actions. But if our assumptions prove correct,
we believe we will be able to absorb, without resorting to additional
special charges, the costs associated with any future productivity
improvements,' he added.
Net losses were Dollars 8.03bn, or Dollars 14.10 per share, against net
income of Dollars 734m, or Dollars 1.29, in last year's second quarter.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 15.5bn, down from Dollars 16.2bn last
year.
The charges were much higher than expected, but IBM's operating losses of 8
cents per share were smaller than most Wall Street projections.
IBM said revenues from computer hardware sales declined 12.9 per cent to
Dollars 7.53bn from Dollars 8.64bn in last year's second quarter.
However, software revenues rose 1.2 per cent to Dollars 2.72bn from Dollars
2.68bn while revenues from maintenance contracts fell 2.3 per cent to
Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.90bn. Service revenues were up strongly by
26.6 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn from Dollars 1.86bn. Rentals and financing
revenues fell 6.3 per cent to Dollars 1.07bn from Dollars 1.14bn.
Costs and expenses for the quarter rose 14.2 per cent to Dollars 9.55bn.
'Getting IBM's cost and expense structure in line with the revenue realities
of our industry . . . is my highest near-term priority,' said Mr Gerstner.
He added that substantial work was under way on longer-term objectives to
improve competitiveness which will take in increased openness and improved
ease-of-use of technologies.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: LTV wins appeal court ruling on
anti-trust suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LTV, the US steel group which last month emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, yesterday said a US appeals court had ruled in its favour,
upholding a lower court ruling in an anti-trust lawsuit against USX's former
Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad unit, writes Karen Zagor.
The net value of the judgment, including interest to date but excluding fees
and costs, is estimated at Dollars 485m. Under LTV's confirmed
reorganisation plan, all proceeds for the litigation will be contributed to
the restored steel pension plans.
The award stems from a 1982 lawsuit against the USX unit which charged that
a number of railroads had monopolised dock handling and inland
transportation of iron ore to steel mills for nearly 30 years. B&amp;LE is the
last railroad to settle.
B&amp;LE has 90 days to petition the supreme court to review the appeal court
ruling. In June, USX said its US Steel unit had taken second-quarter pre-tax
reserves of more than Dollars 400m to cover damages in the case.

USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel unit of USX, yesterday reported a
second-quarter net loss of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 5.66 cents a share. This
included an after-tax charge of Dollars 403m related to anti-trust
litigation against its former railroad subsidiary, the Bessemer and Lake
Erie Railroad.
A year earlier, the company had restated net income of Dollars 2m, or 3
cents a share.
Stripping out the one-time charge, the company said operating income rose to
Dollars 56m in the latest quarter from a restated Dollars 34m a year
earlier.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX Corporation, the consolidated parent
company, attributed the improved performance of its steel group to firmer
industry conditions. During the 1993 quarter, steel shipments were at their
highest level since the 1990 fourth quarter.
Sales in the quarter rose to Dollars 1.43bn from Dollars 1.27bn.
For the six months, the steel group had a net loss of Dollars 320m, or
Dollars 5.49, against a deficit of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 26.03. The
1992 figures have been restated to include the adoption of two new
accounting standards. Sales rose to Dollars 2.64bn from Dollars 2.43bn.
USX's Delhi Group, the company's gas business, turned in
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of Dollars 2.1m, or 15 cents,
against Dollars 9m, or 5 cents, a year ago.
USX-Marathon Group, the oil business, posted second-quarter net income of
Dollars 21m, or 63 cents, down from Dollars 181m, or 63 cents, a year
earlier.

production setbacks

ASARCO, the US integrated copper producer, lost Dollars 24.1m, or 58 cents
per share, in the second quarter after production problems at its
recently-expanded Arizona mines and processing plants led to a fall in
output.
The company also continued to be hit by declining base metals prices.
Asarco earned Dollars 4.4m, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter of
1992. Sales were Dollars 416.6m, against Dollars 487.7m last year.
For the six months to June 30, Asarco reported a loss of Dollars 55m, or
Dollars 1.32, down from Dollars 10.8m, or Dollars 1.30 per share. Sales for
the first half were Dollars 875.6m, down from Dollars 946.6m last year.
During the quarter the company's average realised price for copper fell 18
cents from a year-ago to 85 cents per pound, with lead and zinc prices also
lower. Its average realised price for silver rose 10 cents to Dollars 4.21
per ounce, and for gold, Dollars 10.45 to Dollars 374.39 per ounce.
In addition to lower prices, Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said earnings
were hit by the shutdown of the Company's Troy silver/copper mine in Montana
and higher costs and lower production rates at its Arizona copper
properties.
He said rains which flooded the Ray mine in the first quarter continue to
dilute the solutions from which copper is extracted, reducing second-quarter
copper cathode production by 3m pounds.
He said low ore grades reduced production at Asarco's Mission mine by 2m
pounds in the quarter, and that start-up disruptions at the new smelter at
its El Paso mine raised costs and trimmed output.
WEAK base metal prices pushed Cominco into losses for the second quarter and
first half of 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The average LME prices for zinc, lead, nickel and copper were off sharply in
the second quarter from a year earlier and were also lower than in the first
quarter of this year. The company said further efforts were being made to
reduce operating costs.
The second-quarter loss was CDollars 16.3m (USDollars 12.7m), or 22 cents a
share, including a CDollars 31.6m gain on the spin-off of Cominco
Fertilisers. This compared with profit of CDollars 18.1m, or 22 cents, a
year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 225m from CDollars 416m. The first half
loss was CDollars 53.1m or 69 cents, compared with profit of CDollars 13.2m,
or 15 cents, on sales of CDollars 517m, against CDollars 746m.
Second-quarter mining and metals sales were off 24 per cent due to lower
prices and also the temporary shutdown of the Trail lead smelter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, appeared
in jeopardy yesterday following confirmation from official sources that the
French government was considering removing him as head of the state-owned
oil group.
According to the source, an announcement is expected before the end of the
summer and could come within weeks. Elf, France's largest industrial group,
is slated for privatisation by early next year.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent was appointed by the Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand in 1989, and in 1981 he was an adviser to Mr Pierre Dreyfus, then
industry minister in the Socialist government. He has been regarded as
vulnerable since the centre-right coalition led by Mr Edouard Balladur took
office in March.
The government can replace the heads of state-owned companies prior to
privatisation. Elf was last week named as one of four companies on the
privatisation short-list, and the sale of the government's 51 per cent stake
is expected by early next year.
Analysts said a move to replace Mr Le Floch-Prigent would demonstrate the
state's continued role in public sector companies, but would not necessarily
involve a shift in strategy for Elf since senior management was firmly in
place.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent has been responsible for a substantial expansion and
restructuring of Elf-Aquitaine. He has reduced the group's concentration on
the French market and expanded its downstream activities. This was achieved
through a series of acquisitions, including the UK assets of Amoco of the US
in 1990, the UK assets of Occidental of the US in the following year, and
the service station network of Heron of the UK.
The Elf chairman has also expanded the group's pharmaceuticals and chemicals
divisions. In 1991, Elf-Sanofi, which is 51 per cent owned by Elf, formed a
joint venture with Sterling Drug of the US. Last year's acquisition of Yves
Saint Laurent consolidated Elf-Sanofi's position as one of the world's three
biggest perfume and cosmetics companies.
But the group is being affected by difficult market conditions. Mr Le
Floch-Prigent has warned that operating profits in the first half will be
about 25 per cent less than in the first six months of 1992. Last week, he
said that he did not anticipate any substantial improvement in basic
chemicals and fertilisers in the second half and that the recent fall in the
oil price was an added difficulty.

TRADING in Daimler-Benz shares on the New York Stock Exchange - the first
German stock to be listed there - will start on October 5, the
automotive-based technology group said yesterday.
The listing, as expected, will be in the form of American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs). Citibank, the main subsidiary of Citicorp, has been
appointed depositary bank.
The move was a further commitment to internationalisation, the company said.
It follows listings in 1990 in London and Tokyo, and in Paris in October
1991.
It also gives Germany's biggest industrial concern access to the world's
largest capital market at a time when domestic sources are strained.
Together with plans to build the group's first US vehicle works, the listing
is also an important image-building move in the world's largest car market.
Last year, Daimler's US sales reached DM13bn - some 13 per cent of the group
total - through 27 group subsidiaries employing 13,000.
The group started negotiations over a listing more than a year ago, together
with other leading German groups - including chemicals concerns with
considerable business interests in north America.
However, the other companies pulled out of the talks because they were not
prepared to meet transparency requirements demanded by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. According to one senior official, the compromise
reached with Daimler did not entail an 'unconditional surrender' by the
German group.
For the current year, Daimler will adapt its accounting methods to 'meet the
expectations of the international investment community,' it said yesterday.
Daimler shares have previously been traded in the US by various banking
institutions issuing their own unsponsored ADRs.

DM255m

<TEXT>
HALF-YEAR net earnings at BMW, the German quality carmaker, fell almost 40
per cent to DM255m (Dollars 147.9m), the company said yesterday.
Although the decline matched most expectations, the company's shares fell
DM16.50 in Frankfurt, to close at DM562.
While car registrations fell 16 per cent in Europe to 200,000, the company
reported an 18 per cent sales surge in the US, where almost 37,000 vehicles
were sold in spite of the generally sluggish state of the upper market
segment.
Conditions in Japan continued to worsen, and BMW sales fell 13 per cent to
12,800, while importers of European cars reported an 18 per cent overall
drop in demand for quality vehicles.
Turnover fell 9 per cent to DM14.74bn, while car production dropped 11.5 per
cent to 277,000.
Output of motorcycles increased 2 per cent to almost 22,000, although sales
fell 3 per cent.
Sales in Germany were down 13 per cent at DM6.2bn, compared with a decline
of 18 per cent to DM4.23bn in the rest of Europe and an 11 per cent increase
to DM4.3bn in other export markets.
BMW continued to reduce costs by cutting its workforce. At the end of the
first half the company employed 72,000, some 3,600 fewer than at the
comparable point in 1992.
Although BMW did not expect the world car market to recover this year, it
said that the European economic downturn should bottom out soon, and that
recovery in North America and the UK would lift business.
BMW, which has benefited from strong sales of its new 3-Series, launched
last year, plans to introduce new variants of this model and the 5-Series at
the Frankfurt international motor show in September.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ferfin rescue faces fresh delay

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company burdened with
total borrowings of about L31,000bn (Dollars 19bn), will have to wait at
least another month for the five banks preparing a rescue plan to finalise
their proposals.
The plan was originally expected at the end of this month, although Ferfin's
foreign creditor banks yesterday appeared prepared to continue supporting
the group.
News of the delay and of the reaction of foreign banks, which have lent
Ferfin about L6,500bn, came as members of the Ferruzzi family discussed
their investment. Serafino Ferruzzi, the ultimate family holding company
through which the Ferruzzis control 48 per cent of Ferfin, indicated it had
made a heavy loss for 1992, though no figures were released.
However, the fact that Serafino Ferruzzi will have to recapitalise to meet
the requirements of Italian company law implies that the 1992 loss exceeded
L460bn, the holding company's capitalisation.
A date for a shareholders' meeting to consider the company's financial
position and its legal relationship with the five Italian banks leading the
Ferfin rescue was put off until the plan was ready.
The banks are expected to unveil their proposals by August 31, when Ferfin
is due to hold a special shareholders' meeting. The assembly, called last
month to approve a drastic write-down in Ferfin's capital, may be followed
by a rights issue.
If the deal goes ahead as expected, it would probably allow leading creditor
banks to exchange some of their loans to Ferfin for equity.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: US sale ends Philips' presence
in defence
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to sell its US defence activities
to its local management team and to Carlyle, a privately-held
Washington-based merchant bank.
The sale marks the last stage of Philips' withdrawal from defence
electronics.
Magnavox Electronic Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary with annual turnover
of more than Dollars 400m, has been for sale since the late 1980s.
Attempts to sell the unit were hampered by the downturn in the sector caused
by the end of the cold war and subsequent sharp cuts in defence spending.
Philips declined to give financial details but said it expected the
divestment to be completed by the end of September, pending government
approval in the US.
In 1990, the Dutch company sold its European defence electronics activities,
mainly to Thomson of France, as a first step in withdrawing from a sector
which was no longer regarded as belonging to the group's core businesses.
Philips was yesterday unable to say whether the transaction would yield a
book profit. The company's second-quarter results, due on August 5, will
include an extraordinary gain of Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 567m) on the recent sale
of its minority stake in an Asian semi-conductor joint venture, Matsushita
Electronics Corp, to Matsushita of Japan.
Philips emphasised that the Magnavox defence activities were unrelated to
Philips' other Magnavox companies in the US, which make televisions and
other consumer products.
The divestment of Magnavox Electronic Systems marks the realisation of a
long-standing goal for Philips, which announced its retreat from defence
electronics in 1989.
A year later, Philips fell into financial difficulties that prompted it to
divest a number of businesses, including personal and mini-computers, as
part of efforts to return to sustained profitability.

owns jointly with Credit Lyonnais, for an increased share in the French
state-owned bank.
Under the terms of the agreement announced yesterday, Credit Lyonnais will
receive Thomson-CSF's 32 per cent stake in Altus, while Thomson-CSF will
raise its shareholding in Credit Lyonnais from 14 per cent to 21.6 per cent.
Thomson-CSF said the deal would free it from a minority shareholding and was
consistent with its strategy of concentrating on core industrial activities.
It said it intended to sell its shareholding in Credit Lyonnais once the
bank had been privatised, estimating that this would raise about FFr10bn
(Dollars 1.7bn).
Credit Lyonnais is on the French government's list of 21 companies which it
plans to privatise. However, no date has yet been set for the sale.
The defence electronics group said the agreement with Credit Lyonnais was
purely financial and not strategic. It said it would not be represented on
the board of Credit Lyonnais.
The deal represents the end of Thomson-CSF's participation in external
treasury operations. It established a financial subsidiary to manage its
foreign exchange business following the award of a Dollars 9bn missiles
systems contract with Saudi Arabia in 1987. In 1989, it ceded control of the
subsidiary, which then became Altus Finance, to Credit Lyonnais.
Since then, Thomson-CSF has gradually reduced its stake in Altus Finance.
'Our activities have diverged,' Thomson-CSF said. 'Altus has diversified its
activities into areas like property and retailing while we are an industrial
company.' Altus is currently engaged in a bid for control of Fnac, the
retailing group.
Last year, Thomson-CSF's stake in Credit Lyonnais was one of the principal
reasons for a 35 per cent decline in net profits, to FFr1.52bn as the French
bank reported its first loss for 18 years. However, it does not expect the
losses at the bank to continue.

FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Pinault considering stake in
Fnac
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR FRANCOIS Pinault, who heads Pinault-Printemps, the French retailing
group, is considering taking a stake in Fnac, the books and music retail
chain which is the target of a takeover bid.
GMF, the mutual insurance group that controls Fnac, last week announced that
it had given an option to acquire a majority stake to Altus Finance, part of
the Credit Lyonnais banking group, and Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE),
the utility company.
Under the terms of the deal, Altus and CGE have an option (lasting until
October 11) to buy 54.78 per cent of Fnac for FFr2,928 a share, or FFr1.3bn
(Dollars 220.7m).
However, the deal is still under scrutiny by the French stock market
authorities. The COB, the stock market watchdog, said yesterday that it had
not completed its assessment.
Meanwhile, La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial daily, yesterday
reported that Mr Pinault had met with representatives of Altus and CGE to
discuss the Fnac situation.
Mr Pierre Blayau, who recently took over from Mr Pinault as executive
chairman of Pinault-Printemps, confirmed that Mr Pinault was interested in
Fnac during an interview with yesterday's edition of Les Echos, another
financial paper.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread sees moderate growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD expected 'continuing, but moderate, growth' in most of its markets
this year, Sir Michael Angus, chairman, told the annual meeting of the
brewing and retailing group yesterday, writes Philip Rawstorne.
During the first four months of the financial year, profitability had been
maintained in the highly competitive beer market and the food businesses
were showing healthy year-on-year growth, he said.
The rate of growth would depend on the group's brands and how quickly and
deeply the current modest economic upturn was consolidated, Sir Michael
said.
'Our brands are strong and extremely well managed. I believe, however, that
our customers - particularly in south-east England - are still in the
after-shock of the worst recession since the war and it may be some months
yet before their confidence is fully restored.'
Sir Michael gave a warning to the government that the levels of tax on beer
were becoming a threat to the survival of large numbers of pubs.
'We calculate that the beer and pub industry contributes Pounds 12bn each
year to the exchequer through all forms of taxes - Pounds 4bn in excise duty
alone. For the British beer drinker this means between 40p and 50p on every
pint going to the government in the form of duty and VAT. That's nearly one
third. It's far too much and there's a real danger that people will begin to
vote with their feet and stay away from their locals.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Linx Printing disappoints with 13% fall to
Pounds 1.43m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINX PRINTING Technologies, the manufacturer of continuous ink jet printers
used primarily to identify and code products, disappointed with its first
full year results since last October's flotation.
Profits before tax for the 12 months to June 30 fell by 13 per cent to
Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.64m) on sales of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.5m).
Earnings per share were 7.1p (8.4p).
Worsening market conditions in the UK and continental Europe led to the
earlier-than-expected release of the results, which followed a profits
warning and the resignation of the sales and marketing director in May.
Attributing the decline to 'pressure on margins, together with continuing
investment in sales and marketing and research and development,' Mr Derek
Harris, chairman, also emphasised that the company's strategy was to reduce
dependence on UK and European markets by expanding sales in the rest of the
world.
Sales revenues, particularly from the Pacific Rim, have increased rapidly
and now represented 25 per cent of the total, he said.
However, North American markets were starting to deteriorate.
Investment in research and development increased to 8.9 per cent (7.9 per
cent) of sales when the new 6000R printer and a new range of inks, including
environment-friendly inks, were developed and launched.
Mr Harris vowed to implement remedial actions in Europe after a marketing
strategy review is completed, but warned the benefits of changes were
unlikely to be evident until later in the group's financial year.
The shares dipped 3p to 89p.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Downturn in debt provisions expected to
signal recovery - Guarded optimism in the market as the UK clearing banks
begin their half year reporting season this Friday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY unfortunate surprises are disclosed when the UK banks start reporting
their half year results on Friday, their shareholders will have a nasty
shock. For 20 years banks have lacked much capacity to startle because they
have been held in so little regard anyway. But this year is different.
The interim results season that starts with Lloyds on Friday and continues
next week, culminating with Barclays, marks a watershed in two ways. One is
that the results are likely to show a downturn in bad debt provisions. The
second is that the recovery that signals is expected to last at least half a
decade.
For the first time in a generation the market has not discounted much for
management incompetence or the likelihood of fresh problems being disclosed.
The banks sector has risen 17 per cent relative to the FT-A All-Share index
this year as the belief that they have mended their ways has taken hold.
This is quite a change from the high inflation era of the late 1970s and
1980s when banks expanded balance sheets by taking on poor risks, and
consumed capital. Shareholders now regard banks as being more tightly
managed in a safer environment, and so capable of generating capital
internally.
Mr Norrie Morrison, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, argues that bank shares are
coming to be valued on earnings rather than yields because banks are more
trusted. The question - for which clues will be sought in the interims - is
whether they have truly undergone a secular shift in behaviour.
Two problems likely to emerge in the results have already been largely
discounted. One is the start of the Standard of Recommended Practice (Sorp)
on the accruing of interest on non-performing loans. This will stop banks
taking interest into earnings and providing against it separately.
The bank likely to be most affected is Lloyds, which has stuck closely to
interest accrual. Although its profits before tax will not be affected,
Kleinwort Benson predicts that the reduction of net interest income will
raise its costs to income ratio by 4.2 percentage points to 66.6 per cent.
The second problem is more substantial: the upsets that have been
encountered by National Westminster, Barclays and Abbey National in
continental Europe. As poor asset quality problems in US operations ease,
similar problems have been exposed in retail bank subsidiaries in France.
Lehman Brothers estimates that NatWest's disposal of its French retail bank
will lead to a Pounds 100m charge, while Abbey National will make a Pounds
65m further provision in the first half against commercial property lending
in France. Barclays is expected to suffer a Pounds 150m loss in France
during 1993.
Despite these local difficulties, total provisions are likely to start
falling. Brokers expect provisions similar to the first half of last year,
but a significant fall on the poor second half of last year. Estimates of
the fall on the second half range from 15 to 27 per cent.
Some of the brightest aspects of the results are expected to be the
contributions made by investment banking subsidiaries, particularly in
treasuries due to currency volatility, and capital markets operations as
companies have raised debt and equity finance rather than borrowing from
banks.
This may make up for sluggish income from the traditional banking activity
of lending. Each of the big four clearing banks has shown declines in loan
volumes since the start of the year, with Lloyds having the sharpest fall.
This limits the scope for interest income without wider margins.
However, static or falling lending has also provided some encouragement to
shareholders because it implies that banks will not have to raise capital to
maintain the regulatory ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. Fears of
rights issues earlier in the year have eased significantly.
Mr Julian Robins of BZW believes that banks are unlikely to repeat the rapid
expansion of assets following the recession of 1979-81 which led to rights
issues in the late 1980s.
The question is whether banks will maintain the increased margins they have
achieved in this recession. Mr Robert Law at Lehman Brothers says profits
before bad debts have risen from 1.38 per cent in the early 1980s to 1.68
per cent in 1992 - or a 50 per cent rise in 'normalised' profitability.
If the interim results mark entry to an era of internal generation of
capital, they will have to display more self-restraint than in the past if
margins are not simply to be squeezed as they compete for business. Mr Law
says this question is 'impossible to answer with certainty' but much rests
on it.
If banks give in to such a temptation, then much of their newly found
respect among shareholders will dissipate. Probably the initial signal will
come from Lloyds, as the bank decides whether to continue accumulating its
already strong capital, or start handing it back in dividends to
shareholders.

Cadbury Schweppes (South Africa), the 53 per cent owned subsidiary of the UK
confectionery group, overcame difficult trading conditions to lift pre-tax
income by 32 per cent to R25.7m (Pounds 5.1m) over the 24 weeks to mid-June.
Sales volume growth in most areas helped boost turnover by 16 per cent to
R344.9m (R296.5m). Improved merchandising and a reorganisation of
confectionery manufacturing facilities helped lift operating profits by 21
per cent to R31.7m (R26.3m).
Lower finance costs and an improved contribution from associate companies
saw attributable income rise by 23 per cent to R26.4m (R21.5m).
The dividend is increased by 20 per cent to 18 cents (15 cents) on earnings
ahead from 61.2 cents to 74.4 cents per share.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: St Modwen pays maiden interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST MODWEN Properties, the Birmingham-based investment and development group,
is paying a maiden interim dividend, acknowledging the steady rise of secure
rental income from its properties.
The group yesterday announced slightly higher pre-tax profits for the half
year to May 31 of Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 1.04m, on turnover sharply
reduced from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 4.06m reflecting the absence of
development property sales.
This meant that the group's sole source of income was from rents. Its rent
roll is presently running at Pounds 7.9m a year and, according to Mr Stan
Clarke, chairman, should be Pounds 9m by the financial year end. Debt
charges arising from gearing, which remains constant at about 100 per cent,
are amply covered.
Mr Clarke said that contracts had been exchanged for two development sales,
and there was another in the pipeline.
The income from the sales will be spread over the current half and the first
half of next year. These funds, combined with the growing rent roll,
underpin what looks like the start of a more liberal dividend policy.
The first interim is 0.3p from earnings per share of 0.6p. The dividend for
1992 was 0.6p from earnings per share of 1.1p.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach arrives at Pounds 13m - East
Kent Travel acquired as further purchases are considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAGECOACH, the Perth-based regional bus service operator, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m in the year to April 30, compared to
Pounds 8.24m and ahead of the Pounds 12.8m forecast at the time of the
company's flotation in mid-April.
Mr Brian Souter, chairman, said the results reflected both organic growth
and the effect of recent acquisitions.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 15.8m) including Pounds
679,000 from acquisitions, while net interest costs fell to Pounds 5.16m
(Pounds 7.43m). Turnover increased to Pounds 154.3m (Pounds 140.7m).
Earnings per share increased by 38 per cent to 8.3p (6p). No final dividend
is recommended but the notional net dividend of 3.8p, set out in the
flotation prospectus, would have been covered 1.8 times.
The group plans to use the Pounds 20.6m proceeds of the flotation to assist
further acquisition-led growth. 'We think there are tremendous opportunities
for us as a bus company to grow,' Mr Souter said yesterday.
The company, which already runs bus services in 13 UK regions and counties
and in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, is acquiring East Kent Travel, the
subject of a management buy-out from National Bus in 1987, extending its
grip over bus services along the south-east coast.
'We are currently investigating a number of other UK bus opportunities and
anticipate substantial activity over the next 12 to 18 months,' he said. In
addition to acquisitions Stagecoach is also likely to bid for services in
London and south Manchester when they are 'privatised'.
Over the past year Mr Souter said the group had made significant progress
towards achieving a target group operating margin of 15 per cent by lifting
bus operating margins from 11.2 per cent to 11.9 per cent.
As part of a five-year fleet modernisation programme the group took delivery
of 299 new vehicles in the UK last year and 112 vehicles overseas.
Expenditure on new vehicles over the next two years will be Pounds 27m
following the Pounds 40m spent over the last 3 years.
Despite heavy capital expenditure of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 13.7m) during the
year the flotation proceeds ensured that the group ended April with reduced
net borrowings of Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 46.9m), equivalent to gearing of 58
per cent, down from 243 per cent a year earlier.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Flying Flowers gets Pounds 11.8m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLYING FLOWERS, the nation's sole flowers-by-post business, is hoping sunny
City conditions for flotations will cheer its listing.
The company's unsentimental institutional backers will be relying more on
perennial sunshine in the hearts of lovers, as well as prickings of filial
guilt on Mothers' Day and at Christmas, to keep up sales of the polystyrene
boxes of blooms at Pounds 8.99 a go.
The Pounds 4.08m placing of 6.29m shares, of which 3.94m are being sold for
the company's main shareholder, is sponsored by Townsley. The shares are
being placed at 65p each to value the company at Pounds 11.8m. Dealings are
expected to begin on August 2.
Flying Flowers has turned a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3,000 and turnover of
Pounds 2.7m in calender 1990, into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 533,000 and
turnover of Pounds 5.36m in 1992. It is forecasting a 76 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits to at least Pounds 940,000 this year, after interim
profits of Pounds 312,000. That gives a prospective multiple at the placing
price of 14.73. The notional yield is 2 per cent, covered 3.2 times.
After the placing, directors and their family interests will account for
63.13 per cent of the enlarged share capital and have given undertakings not
to dispose of any shares before the year's results are published, without
the consent of Townsley.
Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said about Pounds 2.5m of the money will go
to Hillcrest Investments, the company's majority shareholder, which is owned
by family trusts of Mr Jim Evans, a non-executive director. Hillcrest will
realise 39.5 per cent of its investment in Flying Flowers leaving it with
33.2 per cent of the issued share capital.
The Pounds 1.07m net remainder will enable the company virtually to
eliminate its Pounds 1.25m debt and allow for expansion in the UK and almost
certainly into continental Europe too.
Mr Goldsmith said: 'Apart from the fact that we still have a lot of growth
in the UK market, we are exploring the logistics of offering the Flying
Flowers service to other European countries.'
He said the only constraint was arrangements with national postal
authorities. The company would 'probably' move into France this year or
next, with only marketing investment necessary for the move.
Mr Goldsmith, previously chairman of the Food from Britain quango, believes
Flying Flowers is the first non-financial services Jersey-based company to
seek a listing.
The company's 17-acre Jersey Flower Centre grows about 5m flowers a year, 80
per cent of which are carnations. Flying Flowers takes about Pounds 30,000 a
week from tourist visitors who also join its 300,000-strong marketing
database.
The company employs an average of 90 people a week.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Arlen chief steps down over plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over board strategy has cost Arlen, the light fittings and electrical
accessories company, its chief executive just 18 months after he was
appointed to the position.
Arlen said Mr Paul Cohen had disagreed in particular with plans to raise
cash by introducing Fortress Trust, the investment company, as a 29.9 per
cent shareholder. Fortress proposes to underwrite a 1-for-1 rights issue to
raise Pounds 7m, in return for the stake and the appointment of four
directors to the board. Arlen needs the cash to redeem Pounds 3.2m in
preference shares which fall due next year.
Mr Cohen came to the Arlen board when it took over Highland Electronics in
1990. He will be replaced by Mr Tom Forsyth, a non-executive director as
acting chairman until September, when it is expected a new chief executive
will be named. Speculation centres on Mr Greville Howard, Fortress chairman.
Arlen refused to comment on further details of Mr Cohen's departure.
However, details of the Fortress Trust proposals are expected in the next
few days.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Restricted growth at Allied Textile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING INTEREST rates restricted first half pre-tax profits growth at
Allied Textile Companies, one of the UK's biggest textile manufacturers.
The company reported a pre-tax figure of Pounds 5.32m (Pounds 5.21m) for the
six months to March 31, representing growth of 2.1 per cent.
The textiles part of the business saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 3.51m
to Pounds 4.26m.
But profits from the financial activities, including rental property and a
cash pile of more than Pounds 27m, fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.06m.
The fall in financial income 'reflected the substantial reduction in
interest rates,' said Mr Peter Honeysett, chairman of the Huddersfield-based
company.
He was optimistic on the textiles side, stating that trading performance
would continue to improve.
'Sales volumes have still to respond fully to the better trading sentiment
experienced in some areas of the business,' he said.
The figures would also be helped as the benefits of capital spending in
1991-92 took effect.
The full year figures, however, would be affected by the timing of property
disposals 'which cannot be determined with any accuracy,' said Mr Honeysett.
Since February, the company has won planning permission to change the use of
two of its industrial sites to housing. Earnings per share rose from 12.38p
to 12.57p and the interim dividend is raised from 4.5p to 4.6p.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk turns in Pounds 4.5m as operating
margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERESK, the Scottish speciality paper company which floated on the Stock
Exchange in June, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.53m in the 27 weeks
to June 5.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 3.12m in the six months to May
28 1992, struck after a Pounds 765,000 loss from activities since
discontinued.
Turnover improved to Pounds 46.9m, against Pounds 46.2m which included a
Pounds 2.89m contribution from discontinued activities associated with the
Caldwells mill where a commodity product line was shut down.
Mr Stefan Kay, managing director, said: 'We have capital expenditure plans
to spend about Pounds 7m a year for the next three years funded by internal
cash generation.' The company, which said at its flotation it would grow
partly by acquisition, has no purchases in mind now, but is considering two
joint ventures.
The graphic board business, which together with label paper operations
accounts for about 60 per cent of turnover, saw steady demand in the UK and
the Benelux countries, but experienced weak sales in Germany without loss of
market share.
Sales of label paper 'developed well'. Demand for sheets of labels, as
opposed to rolls, was sharply higher and the company was forced to employ
contractors to meet orders.
Inveresk believes the new pattern of label buying indicated economic
recovery as demand for sheets signals companies were seeking to respond more
quickly to changes in their markets.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 4.67m (Pounds 3.31m) and net operating
margins improved to 9.9 per cent (9.4 per cent).
Net interest payments dropped to Pounds 140,000 (Pounds 181,000).
The company is not paying a dividend until the final, which will be proposed
when results for the 53 week period to December 4 are published. Earnings
per share increased to 8.6p (6.1p).

<TEXT>
CANTAB Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge-based biotechnology company which has
a US quotation, has raised Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) in a private placing to
four institutional investors.
The move, which broadens its shareholder base by three, follows a dialogue
since the company floated in 1992. Mr Paul Haycock, chief executive, said:
'Our initial public offering in the US, when conditions were not ideal, was
just 1m shares.'
He said a number of institutions in the US had expressed a continuing
appetite for the issue, which is traded on the Nasdaq market where many
American biotech stocks are traded.
Mr Haycock, who is understood to be considering floating Cantab on the Stock
Exchange later this year or early next, said: 'The money will be used for
the continuing development of our current products and the establishment and
development of our portfolio for the future.'
The company is developing products which use the properties of the immune
system to treat disease. It is working on leucocyte modulators, which
regulate or block immune system functions and therapeutic antigens, which
activate specific immune responses.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEBLEY &amp; Scott, the 213 year-old gunmaker, yesterday completed a journey
from mainstay of the British Army to bit player in the UK's leisure
industry.
The Birmingham-based company was sold for an undisclosed sum to Scalemead, a
Sussex-based supplier of military memorabilia including swords and replica
guns.
The seller is Harris and Sheldon, a private Coventry-based company better
known for fishing tackle under the House of Hardy brand, and Antler luggage.
Webley employs 75 people, and sales are worth more than Pounds 2m a year.
Exports account for 60 per cent of output.
The new owner has told Webley that all employees can continue with the
company at its current location.
Webley began its life as part of the Midlands iron industry in the early
days of the industrial revolution. Its fortunes peaked in the first world
war when it sold more than 500,000 revolvers to the British Army.
The bottom fell out of the revolver market, however, during the Vietnam war
in the 1960s when cheap automatic pistols flooded the world market. Webley
then pulled out of the shotgun business in the late 1970s as competition
from cheap imports took its toll.
The company now makes only air pistols and air rifles, 'designed for hunting
and for killing vermin,' said Mr Simon Baugh, Webley's sales and marketing
manager. 'But most people use them just for recreation.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hambros shares jump as Norwegian claim
settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hambros gained 15p to close at a five-year high of 360p yesterday
after the merchant bank announced that it had settled one of the two large
Norwegian claims against it relating to the collapse of the late Hilmar
Reksten's shipping empire in the 1970s.
Hambros was being sued for Pounds 200m, plus interest on that amount since
1989, by the Norwegian Guarantee Institute, which had guaranteed Mr
Reksten's loans, and by the trustees of Mr Reksten's estate. Mr Reksten died
in 1980.
Yesterday Hambros said it had reached a settlement with the trustees under
which they had withdrawn all their allegations in the proceedings and future
litigation by them was prohibited.
In return Hambros Bank has made a Norwegian Kroner payment equivalent to
about Pounds 7.25m. However, the company emphasised that the payment had
been made 'with no admission of liability.'
Hambros, which has always considered the trustees' claim to have been
ill-founded and in breach of a settlement made more than 12 years ago, said
it had agreed to the settlement 'in order to avoid substantial legal costs
and demands on senior management time.'
The negotiations which led to the settlement were instigated by the trustees
and began in May after Hambros won a court case in Oslo.
In the other Reksten-related case brought by the Norwegian Guarantee
Institute the court did not award costs in its judgment in February.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions lift Menvier-Swain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and fire
alarms company, increase pre-tax profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 7.62m in
the year to April 30.
Turnover increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 56.8m. The group said it had
made five acquisitions during the period, which had boosted sales by Pounds
8m and contributed Pounds 1m towards operating profits of Pounds 8.19m
(Pounds 6.59m).
Nugalec, the French fire alarm company purchased for Pounds 10.5m in
February - funded by a rights issue - was performing well ahead of
expectations.
Mr Roy McDowell, chairman, said UK operations so far in the current year
were operating at levels ahead of the same period last year. This was the
case with all of Menvier's other operations with the exception of its
smaller operating companies in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal,
which were beginning to see effects of recession.
He added: 'All this, coupled with the ongoing impact of new safety
legislation on the demand for our products, gives me every confidence that
we have the potential to achieve another improved set of results in the
current year.'
Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said he was unlikely to make another
significant acquisition, or rights issue, for some time as the group
concentrated on integrating its recent purchases. Line management was being
strengthened below board level.
Less than half group sales now come from the UK, and France accounts for 30
per cent of the total. Mr Fletcher said the group was interested in
opportunities in the Pacific Rim.
Menvier eliminated borrowings of Pounds 2.4m during the year and ended with
net cash of Pounds 700,000, despite increasing spending on product
development.
Earnings per share increased by 21 per cent to 34.1p (28.1p). A proposed
final dividend of 7.7p brings the total for the year to 11p (9p).

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tamaris plans capital restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAMARIS, the long term care provider, has announced plans to overcome the
financial difficulties of recent years with a capital restructuring, placing
and open offer.
The money is being raised to turn a deficit on shareholders funds of Pounds
724,000 at March 31 to a surplus of about Pounds 556,000 and to fund
development.
Under new management, a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m for the year to
end-March 1991 has reduced to a deficit of Pounds 50,000 in 1992-93. The
board plans to operate 1,000 beds within the next five years. It currently
has 234.
The capital reconstruction involves the conversion of all preference shares
and the raising of new equity shares.
The company has not paid a dividend on preference shares since April 1991
and has passed its payments to ordinary shareholders since August 1989.
Preference shareholders will forfeit accrued rights to Pounds 440,000.
Under the proposals every 100 preference shares will be converted into 960
ordinary shares.
Each existing share and each converted ordinary share will then be split
into one new ordinary share and one deferred share.
The company is simultaneously raising a net Pounds 1.28m through the issue
of 78.9m new shares at 2p each, in the placing and open offer.
The open offer is restricted to 44.9m shares. Qualifying shareholders will
be entitled to apply for 16 offer shares for every 15 existing shares and
10.24 offer shares for each preference share.
The remaining 34m new ordinary shares are being placed firm.
The capital will be reduced by cancelling the deferred shares arising on the
subdivision and reducing the amount standing to the credit of the share
premium account by approximately Pounds 2.7m, subject to the agreement of
shareholders and the High Court.

FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tottenham forced to tackle second forecast
from Venables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, yesterday launched another
salvo in the increasingly bitter battle with Mr Terry Venables, the former
chief executive
Tottenham said yesterday that it had been forced to make a statement to the
Stock Exchange following 'another profits forecast blunder' by Mr Venables.
The company said Mr Venables had, in response to a question on the
television programme Sport in Question, stated that profits would be Pounds
4.7m for the 10 months to May 1993. This was the second unauthorised public
statement on company profits made by Mr Venables in recent months, Tottenham
said.
'The company wished to make it clear that this statement is wholly
unauthorised and is based on the latest unaudited management accounts for
the company which are subject to amendment and are intended for private
circulation only,' a statement said.
'The company stands by the profit statement made in response to a previous
public statement made by Mr Venables, which indicated pre-tax profits for
the first 10 months ended March 31 of approximately Pounds 4m.'
Tottenham has given an undertaking not to remove Mr Venables from the board
before his court case in the autumn which seeks to force Mr Sugar to sell
his 47 per cent stake. The undertaking is expected to remain in place in
spite of the latest statement. Mr Venables holds 23 per cent.
Mr Venables also stated on the programme, broadcast on Carlton TV on Monday
night, that he intended to lodge a Pounds 1m claim for wrongful dismissal
over the loss of his job as chief executive. In the latest twist to the
increasingly personal battle between the two former friends, Mr Sugar
claimed in the statement made yesterday that Barclays Bank would allow an
overdraft facility only if he and Mr Colin Sandy, the finance director,
remained on the board.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Peace made in tunnel dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL and the contractors building the Channel tunnel yesterday
announced an agreement to end their long conflict, paving the way for a
phased opening of the tunnel next year.
The 20-page agreement between Eurotunnel and Transmanche-Link, the
Anglo-French consortium of contractors building the tunnel, is aimed at
settling the bitter dispute over which of the two should be responsible for
heavy cost overruns. The contractors have claimed about Pounds 1.2bn.
The deal does not settle the claim, but disentangles it from the task of
completing, testing and commissioning the tunnel so that the opening can go
ahead unimpeded.
A target date of December 10 has been set for TML's handover of the project
to Eurotunnel. The parties have agreed on how the remaining commissioning
tests should be carried out.
Between now and the handover, Eurotunnel will advance Pounds 235m to TML as
a downpayment on the settlement of its claims, providing TML with an
injection of working capital.
Eurotunnel is arranging a stand-by facility of Pounds 120m so that the extra
payment does not cause it to run out of cash before a rights issue expected
next spring.
The deal will require the approval of 220 banks in the syndicate, led by
National Westminster, Midland, Credit Lyonnais and BNP.
They have to approve the Pounds 120m facility and changes to construction
agreements.
Bankers said they expected the changes to be agreed without difficulty. The
Pounds 120m standby facility would be syndicated within the current bank
group.
Mr Neville Sims, TML co-chairman, said yesterday that the Bank of England
had 'held the ring' at five meetings attended by a representative of the
main banks. Without Bank of England help, it 'could have taken several
months rather than weeks'.
The deal means that freight trains and shuttles carrying lorries should
start passing through the tunnel early next March, with shuttle trains for
cars by the beginning of May and passenger services by October.
Eurotunnel's share price gained 27p yesterday to close at 434p.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Pearson turns its spotlight on the media: The reasons behind
the UK group's decision to dispose of its china and oil interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson at last came out yesterday and finally admitted in public what has
long been whispered in private - that it is a media, information and
entertainment group.
Its metamorphosis has been spread over a decade, but it was only yesterday
that the tadpole finally turned into a frog with the announcement that it
had decided to demerge Royal Doulton, the fine china company, and sell a
majority stake in Camco, its oil services division.
'Shareholders increasingly view Pearson as a media company and value it as
such. While fine china and oil services are attractive investments in their
own right, they do not add value to investors looking for exposure to the
media sector,' Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday.
The one exception to the new focus on the media will be Lazard Partners,
Pearson's associated merchant bank. 'Marvellous cash flow and extremely good
advice. We are very happy with it,' said Lord Blakenham.
The changes over the past decade may have been gradual but they have been
fundamental. In recent months they have intensified with the acquisition of
Thames Television.
In the early 1980s Pearson's interests ranged from Fairey, the engineering
group, through oil companies to Chateau Latour, the leading French vineyard.
Media interests, such as the Financial Times, Penguin and the Economist
accounted for a third of capital employed.
By the end of last year, two thirds of the Pounds 2.1bn capital employed was
accounted for by media and entertainment, boosted by the addition of
companies such as Addison-Wesley, the US educational publisher; Les Echos,
the French financial daily; and a 17 per cent stake in British Sky
Broadcasting, the satellite television venture.
'Our distinctive strengths include the ownership and exploitation of brands,
imprints and intellectual property rights,' said Lord Blakenham.
Unfortunately yesterday's announcement came the day after Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation beat Pearson to control of a large media prize,
the Hong Kong-based Star TV satellite system which broadcasts to 38 Asian
countries.
'They managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. If they had put
money on the table in the first week they would have had it,' said one of
those involved in the negotiations.
Pearson had been negotiating for a month with Star TV, owned by Mr Li
Ka-Shing and his family and Hutchison Whampoa, also controlled by Mr Li. The
UK group was unwilling to accede to Mr Li's insistence on a public offering
for the company. It wanted him to remain a minority shareholder until after
1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese ownership.
Goldman Sachs, the merchant bank representing Mr Li orchestrated an auction.
Mr Murdoch had earlier made an offer and walked away from the venture, which
claims 65m viewers in 15m Asian homes.
He was persuaded to come back less than two weeks ago. He interrupted Mr Sam
Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, on the first day of a holiday in
Australia and dispatched him to Hong Kong. Mr Chisholm stayed until the deal
was complete. Mr Murdoch agreed the Dollars 525m shares and cash deal for
63.4 per cent of Star on Thursday. On Sunday Pearson, which offered a
considerably higher price than Mr Murdoch as long as Mr Li stayed in, was
still negotiating in Hong Kong in good faith.
Lord Blakenham yesterday put a brave face and would only say that Pearson
would have been interested in Star under the right terms and conditions.
One Pearson executive said: 'We are not Rupert Murdoch. He came within half
an hour of going bust. We don't bet the shop and are happy to stand on our
record.'
Analysts yesterday supported the principle of Pearson's strategy, but
expressed surprise at the 'bottom of the cycle' timing of the demerger of
Royal Doulton and disposal of Camco.
In 1992 Royal Doulton and Camco accounted for 30 per cent of Pearson's
Pounds 1.6bn sales and about 7 per cent of the group's Pounds 156m operating
profit.
Royal Doulton, which Pearson has owned for just over 20 years, made a
operating profit of Pounds 10.7m last year on sales of Pounds 200.9m. It
will be demerged from Pearson probably before the end of this year and will
have a separate Stock Exchange listing. Pearson shareholders will be given
the Royal Doulton shares if they agree to the demerger. Although Royal
Doulton, whose brands include Royal Crown Derby, Minton and Royal Albert,
has been hit by the recession, it has performed well in its sector.
Pearson decided that the best way to get maximum value for Camco, a US
company which makes everything from rock drilling bits to testing equipment
for oil and gas wells, was to go for a public offering in New York. A
majority will be offered, probably in the first half of 1994. Pearson will
hold on to the remaining stake for a limited period. Camco had operating
profits of Pounds 500,000 last year on sales of Pounds 289.8m.
In a final irony yesterday, Mr Murdoch - still on 'holiday' on his new yacht
Morning Glory - spotted that the Pearson announcement had driven up the
share price.
He got rid of 16.5m Pearson shares through Goldman Sachs at 464p - about
Pounds 76m in all.
It was the last remnant unencumbered by convertible agreements of a
loss-making stake in the group that peaked at 20.57 per cent in Jan 1988.
The opportunistic move will help to pay for his acquisition of Star TV.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Currency helps Reuters gain 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS Holdings, the international news and information group, yesterday
confirmed it expected double-digit revenue growth this year, helped by the
impact of sterling's devaluation.
The group, which on Monday announced a Pounds 350m share repurchase scheme,
increased pre-tax profits by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 214.7m in the six
months to June 30. Revenues rose 19.7 per cent to Pounds 895.8m, but after
stripping out the effect of currencies, the gain was only 5.7 per cent.
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said the share buy-back scheme should be
viewed against the background of a business that was growing strongly. 'We
are comfortable with the market we are in. Financial services is not a
'Jurassic Park' business.'
Group net cash balances totalled Pounds 629.8m at the half-year. Mr Job said
Reuters would still have a sizeable sum to invest even after the repurchase
scheme. 'However, we will not buy businesses just for the sake of it. We do
not want to become a professional acquirer.'
Mr Rob Rowley, finance director, said currency movements were expected to
enhance earnings in the second half, although the benefits would not be as
pronounced as in the opening six months. He said: 'The see-saw of currencies
is a worrying factor, but together with price stability and better order
flows, we expect continued business growth in 1994.'
Operating profits rose 19.2 per cent to Pounds 184.1m, while margins were
maintained at 20.6 per cent.
Mr Rowley said capital expenditure was about Pounds 40m higher at Pounds
105m during the half and might reach a new peak for the year as a whole.
Working capital also increased for the first time in four years.
Mr Job was satisfied with the progress of the group's electronic transaction
product range, particularly Dealing 2000-2 and Instinet. He added: 'The
volumes on Globex, the financial futures matching service, continue to rise
in Paris, but we are concerned that the activity on the system in Chicago
remains low. We are working with the Chicago exchanges to increase volumes.'
Business in the Americas remained strong, and the UK was showing
improvement. Rapid expansion continued in Russia and eastern Europe while
western Europe was mixed. China was especially buoyant in a generally
favourable Asian context.
The interim dividend was raised 17 per cent to 6.2p from 5.3p. Earnings per
share went up to 34.4p, against 24.5p.

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank, expects 1993 profits at least to
match last year's level, in spite of poor economic conditions and high
credit risks, according to chairman Mr Hilmar Kopper.
The scale of the bad debt risks showed up for the first time in half-year
results published yesterday. Risk provisions, especially for domestic
credits, totalled DM1.38bn compared with DM955m last year.
Operating earnings, adjusted for the provisions, rose 12.6 per cent at
DM2.56bn (Pounds 994m). The figures were prepared for the first time
according to new European community guidelines.
On a like-for-like basis with 1992 first-half results, earnings were 22 per
cent higher at DM3.86bn.
Mr Kopper said the bank was flexible and strong enough to achieve a
satisfactory result even in today's difficult environment.
Net income last year was DM1.8bn compared with DM1.4bn in 1991. After-tax
earnings in the first half of this year rose 14.3 per cent to DM1bn, against
DM915m.
Net interest income advanced to DM5.85bn from DM5.5bn, while trading
earnings rose strongly from DM600m to DM808m.
Customers' deposits increased DM17bn to DM259bn, while savings deposits
dropped by almost DM1bn to DM42.2bn. Group operating costs rose from DM5.2bn
to DM5.7bn.
Deutsche, the first of the big banks due to report in the next few weeks,
suffered a 3.2 per cent fall in operating profits in the first part of 1992,
blaming global economic conditions.
German bankruptcies have risen rapidly among long-established industrial
companies, and only yesterday the VDA car industry association warned of
looming insolvencies among motor component suppliers, many of which are
medium-sized privately owned concerns. So far in 1993, corporate
insolvencies are up 20 per cent over the early part of 1992, when the
economy was still growing relatively strongly.
Yesterday's Deutsche figures confirmed the slowdown forecast by Mr Kopper in
May.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Spring Ram gives Rooney a reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL Rooney is to continue as chief executive of Spring Ram, the
bathrooms and kitchens group he co-founded - at least for the time being.
That was the unexpected outcome yesterday of a two-week stand-off between
the board of the Yorkshire company and its institutional investors, led by
the Prudential Corporation.
Spring Ram announced that Mr Rooney's role as executive chairman will be
taken by Mr Roger Regan, a building industry veteran who was approached by
institutions after Spring Ram issued three profit warnings within eight
months, causing a collapse in its share price.
Mr Regan, 50, spent three years as managing director of AG Stanley until its
takeover by the Ward White Group in 1988. He is chairman of the recently
floated Fine Decor Group. Mr Regan will be joined on the board by Mr Martin
Towers, who has been appointed finance director, and Mr Richard Fortin, a
non-executive director.
Mr Regan said the new board's immediate task would be to review the report
being prepared for the interim results announcement on September 22.
One option will be to bring in a new firm of accountants to check the work
of Spring Ram's existing auditors, Arthur Andersen, which signed off the
annual accounts without qualification.
Asked if it was not likely that any review would make extensive provisions,
one large shareholder said: 'At least that would give us a solid basis to go
forward from. This company was not built by acquisition or debt - we believe
there is a solid underlying business.'
The new executive chairman said he would have responsibility for corporate
and executive matters, while Mr Rooney would concentrate on developing
sales.
Mr Regan said it would be best if the new board could continue to harness Mr
Rooney's 'great entrepreneurial talents'.
One source said if Mr Regan could not work with the chief executive, then
the new board had the votes to sack Mr Rooney.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Cabinet backs end to public sector pay ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, has won cabinet backing for his plan to
scrap next year the rigid 1.5 per cent ceiling for public-sector pay
settlements.
But the government is expected to replace the formula with tight cash limits
on the pay bills of the main Whitehall departments.
The expectation among ministers is that the overall wage costs of the public
sector will not be allowed to grow by more than about 2 per cent.
With the annual public spending negotiations now under way Mr Clarke argued
that a second year of rigid pay restraint would increase the risk of
damaging pay rises when the ceiling was lifted.
That view, shared by Mr John Major, has been accepted by colleagues serving
on the cabinet committee charged with meeting the government's spending
targets.
The decision has heightened concern within Whitehall that the government
will be unable to avoid significant cuts in capital spending programmes
unless it replaces the present formula with a cash limit.
The Department of the Environment in particular has warned that it may be
impossible to hold down local authority pay without a clear signal on the
need for continuing restraint.
The Treasury's public spending targets allow for growth in spending of less
than 1 per cent a year in real terms for the next three financial years.
In spite of a series of negotiations between Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, and the ministers responsible for the main
spending departments, bids for funds in the 1994-95 financial year are still
several billion pounds above the Treasury's Pounds 254bn cash target.
Few of the spending ministers have been willing to concede any reductions
ahead of the autumn, when the cabinet committee will examine line-by-line
all the principal Whitehall budgets.

FT  28 JUL 93 / GM accused of trying to destroy Volkswagen: Computer
'hacking' charges described as absurd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has launched a ferocious
counter-attack on General Motors, accusing the US group of trying to destroy
his company and undermine the German economy.
Goaded into action by legal setbacks and continued harassment by GM lawyers,
Mr Piech suggested that agents of the US group or disaffected VW employees
might have 'hacked' into Volkswagen's computer system to plant GM secrets in
the German group's network.
He also implied that GM could have put confidential information in boxes
found in a house formerly occupied by two VW employees who moved from Adam
Opel, GM's German subsidiary, in late March.
Opel described the charges, to be published tomorrow in Stern, an
illustrated weekly, as 'absurd'.
Mr Piech's attack is expected to continue at a hurriedly called press
conference in Wolfsburg today. After weeks of restricting its statements to
flat denials of all charges and allegations of industrial espionage against
former GM employees now at VW, the German group has swung on to the
offensive.
'This is mud-slinging,' Mr Piech told Stern. 'And if we are to be attacked
with dirt, we must defend ourselves accordingly.'
He accepted that if Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global
purchasing chief at GM and now VW production director, was proved to have
spied on the US company, then he himself would suffer 'grave consequences'.
'But this will not happen,' he claimed. If he and Mr Lopez went, then the
'English disease' - the collapse of industry and Japanese domination - would
break out . . . and not only at VW. Our opponents would have achieved what
they wanted. They would have won a war.'
Mr Piech told the magazine that an internal audit of VW computer programmes
was under way to see if 'anything has been foisted on us'. If anything was
found, then VW would go to state prosecutors and make charges.
Referring to four boxes containing secret GM data, allegedly left in a
Wiesbaden house by Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza, two
former Opel managers now at VW, he said there was 'a striking conflict
between my colleagues' affidavits and the items found in Wiesbaden'.
The boxes 'could have been at the disposal of our opponents and then handed
to the police,' Mr Piech stated. The issue of what was in the boxes
originally and what they contained now was an open question.
VW last week failed in a court attempt to stop Der Spiegel, the weely news
magazine, continuing to report damaging allegations against Mr Lopez and VW.
It later suffered a further blow when prosecutors investigating spying
charges established links between Mr Lopez and the Wiesbaden boxes.
On Monday Opel lawyers 'suggested' that Hamburg prosecutors should examine
the contradictions between GM employees' testimony and affidavits from Mr
Piech, Mr Lopez and others.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Packaging industry given deadline for recycling waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE packaging industry has been given until the end of the year to draw up
plans for recycling between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of all packaging
waste by the year 2000, the government said yesterday.
The move would make a 'significant contribution' towards the government
target of recycling a quarter of household waste by the end of the century,
ministers said.
The proposals drew a mixed response from industrialists and
environmentalists in the wake of the recent crisis in the German recycling
scheme. While German households have enthusiastically sorted rubbish,
industry has been reluctant to use recycled material. The result has been
mountains of unwanted waste plastic.
Mr Cameron Mclatchie, chairman of British Polythene Industries, one of
Europe's largest polythene film producers, said yesterday that the
government's emphasis on recycling household waste was unrealistic.
'It does not make environmental or economic sense, although it is
politically easy to tell people they should recycle. It's what they want to
hear,' he added. 'We are not making a lot of money' recycling industrial
plastic waste at the moment 'and we are not prepared to invest further until
it becomes profitable'.
Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, criticised the lack of statutory
targets in the measures.
But Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said 'if the industries concerned
cannot satisfy us by Christmas that they are committed to achieving the
objectives . . . we will need to move towards a legislative approach'.
Mr Gummer is inviting senior packaging industry figures to produce plans
within five months for reaching the targets. He has stressed that he wants
to avoid the 'alarming imbalance in some (European) schemes . . . between
what is collected and the ability to reprocess it'.
Some industrialists and consultants questioned whether recycling might be
environmentally damaging due to the extra transport and energy costs
involved.
Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the Industry Council for
Packaging and the Environment, said: 'The logistics of collecting waste into
usable quantities are quite horrific.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest CBI survey will not make happy reading for a prime minister
hoping to rebuild his tattered credibility. Far from promising an
accelerating recovery as parliament reconvenes after the summer recess, it
lends credence to anecdotal evidence that the recovery is slowing. A
run-down of stocks is likely to inhibit domestic demand. Manufacturers are
still not ready to invest in additional plant and machinery. Above all,
export demand is softening because of the slowdown in Europe.
That raises the question of how the British economy would be affected by any
collapse of the ERM. Despite the recent rise in sterling, exporters seem
more worried about the state of the markets in Europe than their
competitiveness at current exchange rates. Arguably British exporters should
thus benefit from a collapse of the ERM that brought lower interest rates
across Europe and boosted demand.
Initially, though, life could become even harder. The French franc might not
fall far if it left the ERM but it would be weaker for a while, conferring
advantage on French industry. As in the UK, continental demand might be slow
to respond to lower interest rates. The case for lower UK interest rates
would then be all the stronger, if only to prevent sterling rising further.
Sterling's higher exchange rate may not yet have priced exporters out of
Europe. But, with or without the ERM, exporters need to be super-competitive
to gain share of what promises to remain an exceptionally weak market.

FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The unsolicited opinion of a credit rating agency that Lloyd's no longer
deserves a triple-A rating is unlikely to shake confidence in the insurance
market. Its reserves against future claims are on most measures a match for
the strongest insurers. If the declared wealth of Names is believed, neither
is there a shortage of equity capital should reserves prove inadequate.
Lloyd's is arguably more exposed to long-tail risks than its big US and
European rivals. But erosion of underwriting capacity remains a bigger
threat to Lloyd's share of world insurance than fears for financial
security.
The most pressing task facing Lloyd's management is thus to attract new
capital. The promise of future profits - backed by higher premiums and an
overdue attack on costs - is a tempting carrot. But potential investors will
have to be convinced that old risks are securely ring-fenced within the
proposed new insurance company. The ability of the new vehicle to pay claims
is where the issue of financial security is most likely to be fought.
The planned audit of reserves across the market should provide firm figures
on which such decisions can be made. But the basis on which reserves for the
new company are set should be as transparent as possible. A settlement with
litigious Names would add a further degree of comfort. One wonders whether
Lloyd's campaign to prove the strength of its ring-fence might even usefully
include a credit rating.

FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Queen and President Mitterrand clearly knew a thing or two when they
agreed to open the Channel tunnel on May 6. The day after that announcement,
Eurotunnel and TML trumpet a partial settlement ensuring an early opening
and prompting a surge in Eurotunnel's share price. The mist has finally
lifted; it is now possible to envisage the red ribbon being cut.
The settlement, though, is far from comprehensive. It is, in fact, a Bank of
England-inspired fudge. Both sides win something from the settlement;
neither gets everything they desire. Eurotunnel is assured of the phased
opening, minimising lost revenues. But it has dropped its claims against TML
for late opening. The contractors no longer have to fund the final stages
themselves. They receive Pounds 235m of cash although they still have to
justify keeping it. The new co-operative spirit may allow a relatively
painless settlement of the Pounds 100m or so which is still in dispute. The
contractors may yet be able to release some of their collective Pounds 200m
provisions.
Eurotunnel can use existing borrowing facilities to pay the Pounds 235m. But
the creation of an additional Pounds 120m standby facility shows the
tightness of its financial position. This makes it all the more imperative
to raise another Pounds 1bn next year. The rights issue prospectus will
certainly make interesting reading since Eurotunnel is unlikely to pay a
dividend until next century. The board may also care to explain why it
wrangled with TML for so long when a settlement last autumn could have saved
it more than Pounds 200m of lost revenues.

<TEXT>
The heroic charges being taken by IBM are in proportion to the epic scale of
the problem facing the company. Yet while Dollars 8bn-worth of red ink and
another 60,000 job losses will slim IBM's distended cost base, it is by no
means clear that current plans will solve the underlying difficulty. IBM has
a near monopoly control of mainframe computer technology but it is rapidly
being undercut by lower cost alternatives. Perhaps the most disturbing
element of yesterday's figures was the 12.9 per cent fall in hardware sales
during the second quarter. The company is losing market share in mainframe
computers to networked personal and mini-computers and other large system
manufacturers. The downturn in mainframe sales is not as bad as the first
quarter, but the pricing structure of the entire market is being
progressively undermined.
Those price and market share pressures will only intensify as the industry
consolidates on standard equipment. IBM, however, cannot easily extricate
itself or its customers from its existing technology. Almost all of its
business units are involved in mainframes, and the company's unified
salesforce is focused on selling packages of this 'big iron'. Mr Lou
Gerstner, the new chairman, has the near-impossible task of managing the
exit from the old mainframe technology while the company is still heavily
dependent on the revenues it provides. Breaking the company up into more
responsive business units may well be sensible in theory, and might have
been more easily done in happier times. What bits of Big Blue would now be
worth is impossible to say, and the route from here to there is as murky as
ever.

FT  28 JUL 93 / German inflation boosts rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN interest rates could be cut further this week even though inflation
has increased again, economists in Germany argued yesterday.
The cost of living in western Germany rose at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent
in the month to mid-July, compared with 4.2 per cent in June, the federal
statistics office reported.
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank, noted that
in the previous three months consumer prices had increased at a 'moderate'
annual rate of 3.1 per cent, thanks partly to cheaper oil.
Although money supply growth was still exceeding the Bundesbank's target
range the rate of expansion was weakening detectably, and if this continued
there was a good chance it would return to within the range of 4.5 per cent
to 6.5 per cent annualised growth fixed by the central bank. The broad M3
money supply measure in June grew at an annualised rate of 7.1 per cent.
Although the consensus yesterday was that there was more than an even chance
of a reduction in German rates, few expect a cut of more than half a
percentage point in the key discount rate, currently 6.75 per cent.
Dr Hufner added that renewed tension in the European monetary system was an
important further argument for an interest rate cut at the central bank's
meeting tomorrow, the last before the summer break.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday it would accept variable bids from
commercial banks for short-term funds in its weekly money market operation.
Some dealers believe the cost of borrowing short-term funds should come down
today by about 0.15 percentage points to 7 per cent.
However in the ERM the Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone
came under some selling pressure yesterday afternoon.
The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark.
Germany's July inflation figure, which matched most forecasts, was based on
preliminary calculations from four important states.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Leading Article: South Africa's constitution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be tragic if the very process designed to bring peace and democracy
to South Africa exacerbated rather than healed tension. Yet it is
increasingly apparent that the constitutional talks at Johannesburg's World
Trade Centre are fudging some of the most important issues in a way that
could undermine their achievements to date. If the African National Congress
and President F W de Klerk's National party are intent on an outcome that
serves their de facto alliance but fails to address the legitimate concerns
of other parties - notably those of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha
Freedom party - the constitution that emerges will be seriously flawed.
Things have not reached such a pass yet. The pace has been tortuous, but
South Africa has come a long way since Mr Nelson Mandela's release more than
three years ago. The draft outline published this week shows just how far:
racial discrimination is banned, human rights entrenched, and all citizens
will be entitled to vote for a 400-member National Assembly, with a Senate
elected by regional legislatures, which together will draw up a final
post-apartheid constitution on principles previously agreed.
Fundamental issues have yet to be properly addressed: how the executive of a
new government is constituted, how it exercises its powers and precisely
what powers the provincial assemblies will have. The outline constitution
leaves South Africans little the wiser. The executive will comprise
representatives of political parties 'occupying a specified percentage of
the seats in the national assembly'. But how will this executive take
decisions - by consensus, as Mr de Klerk demands, or by majority, as Mr
Mandela insists?
Regional powers
An equally serious flaw is the failure of the draft to define the powers of
regional governments - the key concern of Chief Buthelezi, who has a strong
regional base among the Zulus of Natal province. The draft fudges the issue
of regional powers: the buck is passed to a commission to be set up only
after the first elections. It will have regional representatives - but the
final say will rest with the cabinet and the constituent assembly, which are
likely to be dominated by the ANC and National party.
The experts who drew up the draft argue that the constituent assembly will
be bound by constitutional principles agreed already, calling for
significant devolution of power to regions. And they list an impressive
array of areas where regions will have at least some power - health,
education, housing, local taxation, local policing. But they refuse to say
how these powers will be shared with the centre, while the constitutional
principles are vague and open to interpretation. Moreover, asking Inkatha to
rely on them misses the point. Inkatha is being asked to give up powers it
now exercises in the 'self-governing' KawZulu homeland in exchange for an
uncertain status in future. It is hard to see Chief Buthelezi waiting until
after an election to find out what Natal's powers will be in the new South
Africa.
Belligerent rhetoric
Until this issue is resolved, one can scarcely be sanguine about the
prospects for elections next April. The trouble is, by boycotting the talks
with his customary belligerent rhetoric, Chief Buthelezi is merely making it
more likely that he will be dissatisfied with the outcome - and creating the
risk of a further descent into violence in the coming months. He needs to
understand that no resolution can come about until he returns to the
negotiating table.
Equally, the ANC and the National party need to look beyond short-term party
objectives and consider the type of political structure that a regionally
diverse as well as multiracial South Africa really needs. For all the
statist, centralising instincts of the two main parties, it is not a country
that can be ruled from the centre alone; its regional inequalities are too
great and the regional rivalries too powerful. An attempt to impose a
constitution that does not allow for sufficient regional autonomy will
merely prompt demands for secession - from Mr Buthelezi's followers or from
the white right. If South Africa is to have a hope of a period of stability
before elections, these issues need to be settled.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Casting light on Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH yesterday of an inquiry into the role of the UK civil service by
a House of Commons select committee is timely. Since 1979, the Conservative
government has been engaged in what one minister recently called 'a long
march' through the institutions of British public life. The civil service
has been one of those institutions, and an appraisal is needed on the
progress of the reforms it has undergone.
Whatever the faults of Whitehall, the civil service model created by the
Northcote-Trevelyan reforms of 1854 has proved durable. It is built on
values of impartiality, objectivity, selection and promotion on merit, and
accountability through ministers to parliament. Envied throughout the world,
these principles have been frequently imitated, though not always
successfully.
Since the second world war, however, there has been increasing
dissatisfaction among politicians over the effectiveness of the civil
service. At its peak, it employed more than 750,000 civil servants, reaching
deeply into many areas of British life. A civil service designed to advise
ministers and administer an empire found itself running a welfare state and
managing the commanding heights of the economy.
The election of a radical Conservative government in 1979 offered an
opportunity for reform that Mrs Thatcher seized. Many civil service
functions have been privatised, others abolished. Departments have been
required to run themselves in more business-like ways. Almost 60 per cent of
civil servants now work in over 80 executive agencies specialising in
services such as the payment of benefits and vehicle licensing. Many must
compete for their jobs against contractors in the government's
market-testing programme.
Efficiency benefits
These reforms have produced benefits in both efficiency and effectiveness.
They have also led to allegations of loss of accountability to parliament,
and of damage to civil service values such as promotion on merit. Evidence
to justify these charges is in short supply, but the select committee is
right to investigate them.
However, the committee should also investigate the charge that the civil
service has not done as much as it could to reap the benefits of these
reforms. Despite losing more than half their staff to agencies, many
Whitehall departments have been slow to reorganise around their new core
functions. A 1991 report by a government efficiency adviser which
recommended 25 per cent cuts in headquarters staff appears to be gathering
dust.
The committee should also ask why there has been no reduction in the number
of white-collar civil servants over the last 10 years. In the private
sector, similar service businesses have achieved substantial productivity
gains.
Privatised utilities
Newly privatised utilities have been able to cut staff by 30 per cent or
more when exposed to market pressures. Finding out why numbers of civil
servants are again rising, especially in the agencies, should be a priority.
So, too, should be the new concerns crowding in over the role of
policy-makers in Whitehall. Responsibility for policy failures such as
sterling's exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the mishandling of the
pit closure programme cannot be solely attributed to politicians. There are
fears that civil servants have become politicised by 14 years of
single-party rule. And the events surrounding the sale of arms to Iraq,
currently under investigation by Lord Justice Scott, give concern over
ethical standards.
A code of ethics is needed to protect both the public and civil servants who
may be pressed to behave unethically. More radical reforms may be needed,
however, to create greater accountability among civil servants for policy
decisions. One solution, proposed by the European Policy Forum, is to
introduce fixed-term contracts for top civil servants who would be paid
according to their performance on publicly-declared objectives.
The select committee could usefully examine the benefits from such an
approach, which appears to work well in New Zealand. However, the committee
should also ask searching questions about whether such reforms would also
bring undesirable consequences such as the further politicisation of the
civil service.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Some roubles more equal than others: The implications of a
controversial currency decision on economic reforms in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It had been going so well.
Though the Russians are masters of illusion, much economic news over the
past two weeks has been good, with a basis in reality. The inflation rate
came down from the near hyper-levels of early this year to about 17 per cent
a month. The central bank raised its interest rate 10 days ago to 170 per
cent - which, because of the Russian system of charging interest on a
monthly basis, makes the yearly rate close to the annual inflation rate of
about 750 per cent. As important, said one western banker in Moscow, was the
breakthrough in the bank's intellectual stance: its actions were an
acknowledgement that money has a cost, and the cost should be borne by the
borrower.
Other measures were starting to take effect: the coal price had been
liberalised (though its effects have been delayed); a government budget had
been prepared with a Rbs11-12 trillion deficit which - assuming foreign
assistance of not less than Dollars 3bn this year - was consistent with a
deficit target of 5 per cent of gross national product by the end of the
year, the level agreed with the International Monetary Fund; sharp falls in
production were levelling off and in a few sectors a modest rise had even
appeared; the rouble had appreciated against the dollar, hauling itself back
over the 1,000 to 1 level.
But the economy remains at a delicate turning point and the shoots of reform
are still fragile. As Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for
finance, said recently, high inflation discouraged investment, and was still
capable of soaring. Privatisation has driven ahead, but few companies have
been restructured and there has been little change in management behaviour.
Russian exports are now almost wholly based on industries such as oil,
diamonds, gold, gas, coal - and the greatest of these, oil, is rapidly
declining as oil wells fall out of production and there is a shortage of
investment capital to get them working again.
The criminalisation of Russian business takes on huge and dangerous
proportions. There have been three highly publicised shoot-outs between gang
members in central Moscow in the past month. Businesses at the very least
avoid tax, while state companies are stripped of their assets by their
managers, who often 'own' parts of them following privatisation. Most of the
money is shipped abroad to foreign bank accounts at a rate estimated this
week by Mr Oleg Lobov, first deputy prime minister for economics, to be
running at Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn a year.
Foreign investment is, considering the size of the country, negligible - in
spite of there being 15 to 20 different committees, associations and
companies created to 'assist' foreign investment. Energy prices are still
minuscule, and it is proving increasingly difficult to raise them. A
sustained effort on the part of the government, led by President Boris
Yeltsin, to persuade the European Community to drop quotas aimed at Russian
commodities flooding into member countries, has had no effect: the EC still
considers Russia to be a 'state trading nation'.
Politically, the reformists within the government are few and under siege -
their one (and considerable) support is the president himself. Last week,
the Russian parliament passed a series of measures aimed at bringing the
radical State Privatisation Committee under ministerial control: taking
licences away from foreign banks; and fixing the budget deficit at Rbs22
trillion, or 25 per cent of GNP. Though the government has relied
increasingly on presidential decrees to push through legislation and on a
weakening of parliamentary influence to continue the momentum for reform,
the political gridlock remained unsolved.
Thus the announcement on Saturday that the central bank had decreed all
pre-1993 roubles as worthless from Monday and that citizens had two weeks in
which to exchange a maximum of Rbs35,000 (Dollars 35) for new notes, came in
a highly charged political context - in which some confidence was starting
to return both to Russian citizens and foreigners working here, but only
just.
The main issue is whether the move signals a return of what have been termed
 -by (the unconsulted) Mr Fyodorov - as 'Stalinist, socialist' methods. Or
is it an aberrant decision, damaging but not fatal?
As details began to emerge of how the decision was taken, it seems that it
may have been cleared at the top before it was announced. Mr Victor
Gerashchenko,the central bank chairman, told the daily Izvestiya in a
typically ambiguous interview that 'the highest responsible officials of the
country were informed about the issue'. He told the newspaper that the
parliamentary administration had been told, and drew its attention to the
fact that Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, had not directly
said he did not know in advance. (Mr Khasbulatov's original comment,
reported by the official Tass news agency on Sunday, was a mild request that
citizens should not suffer unduly from the move: only on Monday did he
emerge in full-throated opposition, blaming the government and its 'crazy
monetarist policy' for it.)
Mr Gerashchenko also obliquely drew the president into the sphere of those
who knew, noting that Mr Yeltsin's 'softening' of the original bank decree,
by extending the limit of money changed to Rbs100,000 and the time period to
the end of August, did not include a hint that 'in principle he did not
approve of these measures'. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister,
was reported to have been the only senior figure who - in the inner cabinet
meeting of last Friday night during which ministers were informed of the
decision - voiced criticism of it.
In the republics, the decree appears to be having its intended effect. Some
five apart from Russia - Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan - have said, with a good or ill grace, that they will continue to
use the rouble and will, sooner or later, exchange the old notes for new.
Four - Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Turkmenistan - are to hasten their
introduction of a new currency. An unambiguously Russian currency has been
created, but the 'good' in this may be hugely outweighed by the bad.
It is likely that old notes will flood back into Russia, to be exchanged at
a present rate of 2:1 with the new, thus at least temporarily stoking
inflation. Second, the republics which are staying within the rouble zone
have agreed no new 'rules of the game' with the Russian government and the
central bank. No mechanism of control of the currency has been created, no
new financial practices set in place. Without these, life can be expected to
go on much as before.
The trust of the population in their money and in authorities which would
safeguard its value has been gravely damaged, if not lost. The pensioners
struggling to change bundles of greasy Soviet roubles in the crush of the
grimy Savings Banks, the holidaymakers stranded in the Black Sea with
worthless old roubles, the harassed women in the queues at state shops
having their money refused and unable to get change for their purchases
because the shop has no new notes - all have been reminded that those at the
top remain careless of citizens' rights and convenience.
In the ranks of the foreign governments which had jointly presented Russia
with a package of support costed at some Dollars 44bn earlier this year, the
fear is now that the government is hopelessly split and cannot deliver a
stabilisation of the currency which some foreign experts and officials
believed was possible this year.
Mr Fyodorov, who inherited Mr Yegor Gaidar's mantle as the main
burden-carrier of economic reform, has been publicly humiliated by being so
casually bypassed in a crucial financial development. He returns from
Washington today, having blasted the decision in terms so unambiguous that
it seems all but impossible he could be reconciled to the president's
compromise. As of yesterday evening, he had given no sign of his intentions.
However, he is thought to be in fighting mood and determined to return to
Moscow to attempt to reverse the decision.
At the very least, the affair demonstrates that the Russian power structure
is thin, disorganised and lacking in the reflexes of a truly civil
governance: and that the pull to reform is fraught with the danger of
reaction. A struggle within the government, subterranean for the past month,
is now openly joined and on its outcome depends the fate of the economy.

FT  28 JUL 93 / From market demons to policy saints: Currency speculators
have rescued EC politicians from their errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As European politicians and bureaucrats ponder how to rescue what is left of
the exchange rate mechanism, the battle to 'save' the French franc gives
rise to a subversive thought. It is that events in the currency markets
since last September have turned the longstanding political demonology of
financial markets on its head.
The conventional wisdom since the 1930s, particularly in left-of-centre
thinking, has been that untamed markets impose deflationary pressure on
governments and destabilise policies that enjoy the support of electorates.
In the 1980s, even right-of-centre politicians have been increasingly
concerned about the capacity of currency markets to overshoot, thereby
increasing trade friction. Yet consider what the currency speculators have
actually brought about since last September.
Away from the core of the ERM, a number of countries, including the UK and
Italy, have been saved from needless deflation and even higher unemployment
as a result of being forced to abandon the link with the D-Mark. If the
Bundesbank decides this week to put the franc on the rack by choosing not to
reduce D-Mark interest rates sharply, further speculation could spare the
French from both severe deflation and a test of the political structure that
might return France to the difficulties of the 1950s and 1960s.
Meantime, market pressure has achieved something that the politicians could
never have pulled off directly. Huge profits on currency speculation have
helped restore bank capital at the taxpayers' expense. Being kind to the
banks after the excesses of the 1980s sounds so shocking to the average
citizen that this could not have been done by open democratic means. Even in
pro-business Japan, public opinion blocked a public sector rescue of ailing
banks. But in a debt-induced recession, the restoration of bank capital is a
precondition of economic recovery. However unwittingly, the speculators have
perpetrated a most constructive act.
It is hard to escape the conclusion that the markets have been saving the
electorates of Europe from policy, not the other way round; and in most
cases, including those of Britain and France, the electorates were not
invited to consider any alternative to the key policy mistake on offer. Nor
will the markets give up, for whatever the Bundesbank does this week, the
speculators have rightly perceived that a rigid link between the franc and
the D-Mark is simply unsustainable as long as the strains of German
unification persist, which they will do until at least the mid-1990s.
This makes a nonsense of the old right-left debate on markets. It seems
clear that the lifting of exchange controls, originally imposed in the
1930s, has resulted in newly empowered speculators pushing governments into
an earlier recognition of the inconsistencies of their policy stance than
would otherwise have been the case.
Yet the air is thick with suggestions from left-of-centre economic
commentators, and some right-of-centre ones too, for putting glue back into
the ERM mechanism. Whatever the political case, the economic case is not
being argued from fundamentals - which is probably because, as Keynes
remarked, practical men are all slaves of some defunct economist.
The defunct economist in this case is, of course, Keynes himself. He
provided much of the demonology with his critique of short-termism in the
General Theory. This led him to conclude that the state should intervene to
take direct responsibility for investment. But he would not have had to
reiterate the point today. Indeed, the fiscal legacy of that policy mind-set
is set to provide the markets with their next big disciplinary opportunity.
Loose fiscal policy is now generating a mountain of debt in the public
sectors of the developed world. By the second half of the 1990s it will be
very tempting for governments to monetise that debt - that is, to default
via inflation. Capital will rush for the exit in anticipation; and the old
left-right rhetorical divide may enjoy new life as politicians claim that
the markets are sabotaging their efforts. But we may also discover the
limits of unfettered financial power.
There has to be one creditworthy country in the global system to provide
capital with its bolt hole. Today it is Japan. But if Japan succumbs to
fiscal laxity - say in an attempt to defuse trade tensions with the US -
there will be no inflation-free haven for investors. The market vigilantes'
goose will be cooked.

<TEXT>
Finding that heaven bears a marked resemblance to life in Switzerland, a new
entrant asks St Peter for permission to check out the alternative. St Peter
issues a standard 24-hour pass and the new boy has a splendid day out. The
devils are friendly and there are some terrific bars and restaurants.
A few days later and St Peter receives a request for another pass. But this
time he only agrees to issue a one-way ticket. Unperturbed, the new boy sets
off happily through the pearly gates. On arrival, he is shocked to find
pools of fire, horrible leering faces and bullies with pitchforks. He
demands an explanation.
'It's easy,' says the devil in charge of customer relations. 'The last time
you were a tourist. This time you are an immigrant.'

<TEXT>
Poor old John Patten. As if it is not enough that Britain's over-worked and
much maligned education secretary has been laid low by a nasty bug, he also
looks like being one of the first casualties of the government's new drive
for greater openness.
On June 18, his department refused a request from Tony Wright MP to publish
an opinion poll on the Parent's Charter. No doubt this was because most
parents were pretty unimpressed with the collapse of the testing which is at
the heart of the charter. The department said that it was not Patten's
practice 'to publish either officials' advice or the research underlying
it'.
So how will he respond next April when Citizen's Charter minister William
Waldegrave brings in his code of practice on the provision of government
information?
While it does exclude officials' advice from disclosure, there is no
exclusion for research which underlies officials' advice.

<TEXT>
What do Fidel Castro and an expensive, brightly coloured woolly jumper have
in common? Not much at the moment but perhaps a lot in the future.
For Benetton, the shrinking violet of the Italian clothes business which
recently opened a number of branches in Cuba, has asked the ageing dictator
to become the figurehead of its planned 'research centre' to be based at
Treviso in Italy.
The letter from Luciano Benetton - the company's head - is a very odd
document, probably one of the last flattering missives Castro can expect to
receive.
It invites Castro to become a 'teacher of revolution' at the new
institution. 'A school of this kind needs a teacher. I thought of you
because many of us have not forgotten the idealistic vision you offered your
country . . .'
'It's not a joke,' says a Benetton pr. 'Castro's political cycle may be
coming to an end but he did do an enormous amount to inspire the youth of
his country and he would be ideal for an avant-garde school.'
What next? Kim Il Sung signs up for Volkswagen?

Small farmers of Germany's Saxony and Thuringia can be forgiven for
complaining that they have been milked during their first brief taste of
capitalism.
Two years ago, a sizeable dairy based near Dresden called Sachsenmilch
became the first east German company to attain a listing on the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange. Glowing proudly, Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest, and an
old hand in the east, closed the offer two days early because of the flood
of demand led by local farmers.
It seemed nothing could go wrong. The cows were plentiful, east Germans
loved the milk, and Stuttgart's Sudmilch, Germany's leading dairy group, was
the majority shareholder. Deutsche had lined up over DM260m (Pounds 100m)
for a new dairy and up-to-date machinery.
Then things started to turn sour. The bankers insist they poured over the
accounts pre- and post-listing, finding at that stage no trace of the
existence of what turned out to be a second contract, as a result of which
Sachsenmilch's former manager, Wolfgang Weber, overran his budget, possibly
by as much as 40 per cent.
The bank bleats that officials simply withheld information. But some Saxons
are now saying Weber's hectic social life should at least have prompted
closer scrutiny of how the dairy itself was run. With Weber now pursuing
other interests in Paraguay, it is small wonder Deutsche is frantically
trying to save the dairy and keep its reputation in eastern Germany afloat.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Sad reflection on engineering in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN GIBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I, and I am sure many other industrialists, greatly regret the recent
changes at the weekly magazine The Engineer, which throughout its long
history has energetically informed those in industry to the benefit of all.
The Engineer's virtual demise flies in the face of the burgeoning interest
in manufacturing at every level of government.
In Germany, where national pride in engineering excellence has proved
unshakeable, such a development would be unthinkable. It is hard not to
conclude that it reflects the value we in the UK place on engineering and
the myriad products it develops and produces.
Industry needs publications with real authority and, with respect, this load
cannot be carried by the Financial Times alone. Through its investigative
journalism The Engineer helped to raise the awareness of industry and place
a focus on the dynamism of engineering.
The Engineer has provided engineers with a stream of information for the
last 137 years. It would take a bizarre sense of timing to conclude that now
is an appropriate time to turn off the tap.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Poor reward for service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Between 1987 and 1992 the workload of the Insolvency Service increased
fourfold. During the same period the number of civil servants employed in
Official Receivers' offices increased marginally.
Insolvency Service workers who coped with the increased number of
insolvencies and maintained the high standards for which they are respected
and renowned have now received their reward for five years' hard work.
The 'independent review' announced recently by Neil Hamilton MP aims to turn
the clock back 100 years and privatise large parts of the Insolvency
Service. The last review in 1982, under the chairmanship of Sir Kenneth
Cork, concluded that individual insolvencies should be administered by
impartial civil servants, ie the Official Receiver. The current review,
however, will consider changes in legislation to ensure that ministers get
what they want, the privatisation of the Insolvency Service.
With spare capacity in the private sector growing as the number of
insolvencies fall, staff in the Insolvency Service will be faced with
redundancy.
The IPMS Insolvency Service Branch will be fighting privatisation because it
is not in the interests of creditors, individual insolvents, insolvency
practitioners, or those in the Insolvency Service who, during the last five
years, have shown what public service means.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Amendment put 'cap' on benefit in kind for cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN DRUMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the Weekend FT article 'The luxury that has become a
necessity' (July 24/25).
The writer of the article suggests that 'there is no 'cap' on the system' of
assessing the benefit in kind of a car provided to an employee on the basis
of the list price. He goes on to quote the example of 'an actual cash
payment of more than Pounds 58,000' on the provision of a Jaguar XJ220
costing Pounds 415,000 where the driver covers less than 2,500 business
miles a year.
While this was the original proposal announced in the 1993 budget, an
amendment was made to the Finance Bill by the sixth sitting of the Finance
(No 2) Bill Standing Committee whereby the maximum list price of a car for
the purposes of calculating the benefit in kind would be Pounds 80,000.
The financial secretary to the Treasury, Steven Dorrell, stated that there
was justification to 'depart from the principles of fiscal purity' - the
argument being that the original budget proposal would be detrimental to the
British car industry and in particular manufacturers such as Rolls Royce.
The Finance Bill is due to receive Royal Assent on July 27 and it is likely
that the Pounds 80,000 limit will become law.
The effect is that the potential tax bill of more than Pounds 58,000
referred to in the article will be reduced by almost Pounds 47,000 to just
over Pounds 11,000.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Privatisation can improve forest management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Buxton's article on forest privatisation ('When money grows on
trees', July 20) concludes that privatisation may be no more successful than
the Forestry Commission at 'balancing commercial needs with environmental
and leisure interests'.
Although it is wrong to imply that environmental and leisure interests
cannot be commercial, there are certainly conflicting interests to balance.
However, both reason and experience suggest strongly that privatisation
would indeed be more successful.
Briefly, public sector management is a zero sum game in which opposing
political 'constituents' and lobbyists are appeased or otherwise. Private
sector management replaces conflict by co-operation and cost sharing. The
largest private landowner in the US, the International Paper Company, not
only practices commercial lumbering but also runs profitable wild life and
recreation programmes in many states, leasing more than 1m acres in the
southern states for such purposes.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Railways are too efficient to be dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM NALTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I welcome the suggestion in your editorial, 'Motorway fatigue' (July
23) that the price mechanism should be used to regulate the demand for road
space rather than building more and more roads.
However, I do not agree with your dismissal of rail transport as a solution.
The busiest parts of the M25 motorway are the sections close to Heathrow
Airport, which is very badly served by public transport. Yet Heathrow
Airport has all the characteristics that make rail transport highly
efficient. It is a point of departure for millions of long distance flights
every year and a very large, highly concentrated area of employment. A
solution based on improved rail access to Heathrow Airport will be far more
effective in reducing M25 congestion than you suggest.
The price mechanism will influence demand, but it can only persuade people
to use public transport if the quality of service is good enough.
Improvement in rail services from all regions in the UK directly to Heathrow
Airport must be a high priority so that people departing from or meeting
flights at Heathrow can make the trip by rail as conveniently as by car. In
addition, a rail equivalent of the M25 linking St Albans, Watford, Slough,
Heathrow Airport, Staines etc in a full circle is needed to provide the high
quality public transport alternative for journeys created by the building of
the M25.
But as Britain not only has the cheapest petrol in Europe, but also some of
the most expensive rail fares, your editorial makes very good sense.

FT  28 JUL 93 / A close nuclear family: West must extend security or expect
proliferation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I suppose,' wrote the Queen to Harold Macmillan on his retirement in
October 1963, 'that the success which may give you the greatest satisfaction
is the recent signature of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty for which you and
your colleagues have worked so long and so patiently and which has given new
hope to people all over the world.' Next week sees the 30th anniversary of
that treaty, which put an end to tests in the atmosphere by the three
leading nuclear powers - the US, UK and Soviet Union.
Macmillan had indeed 'passionately fought' for a test ban, as the late Lord
Zuckerman, then chief scientific adviser at the UK defence ministry,
testified in an article published shortly before his death - in Nature on
February 4. But the ultimate bargain was struck between the two superpowers
and fell well short of what Macmillan had wanted - 'the discontinuance of
all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time'. Those words were left
in the preamble of the treaty, expressing a long-term objective. That is why
it is called the 'partial' test ban treaty (PTBT), as opposed to the holy
grail of a 'comprehensive' one (CTBT), for which the quest continues.
It continues more hopefully of late, particularly since last October when
Congress forced then-President George Bush to sign an act imposing a
moratorium on US nuclear tests until mid-1993 and ending them completely by
September 1996. On July 3 his successor, Bill Clinton, extended the
moratorium until September 1994 'as long as no other nation tests', and
called on 'the other nuclear powers to do the same'. Russia, and more
surprisingly France, promised to do so and declared their support for a
CTBT, 'on condition (in France's case) that it is universal and verifiable'.
Britain has no choice in the matter, since it uses US testing facilities and
has none of its own. But sadly (or at least it would have saddened
Macmillan) British representatives were prominent among those lobbying in
Washington for continued testing in the run-up to the July 3 announcement.
Mr Clinton's decision, soon to be complemented by the appointment of an
ambassador to revive the CTBT negotiations, is part of his strategy for
containing nuclear proliferation. In 1990 the review conference on the 1968
Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) broke up without agreement because the
non-nuclear states, led by Mexico, insisted on a CTBT as the yardstick for
nuclear states' sincerity in pursuing disarmament. At the next conference,
in 1995, the stakes will be higher because it has to decide whether to
extend the treaty indefinitely or for a fixed period.
Also, with the break-up of the Soviet Union, proliferation has become an
even more complex and worrying issue. The western powers have tried to deal
with it by recognising only Russia as a successor to the Soviet Union's
nuclear power status. Both the strategic arms reduction treaties (Start I
and Start II) are based on that assumption.
Other ex-Soviet republics were not involved in those negotiations, but last
year the three that have strategic weapons on their territory - Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Ukraine - were bullied or cajoled into signing an agreement
(the Lisbon protocol) which provides for those weapons to be dismantled or
transferred to Russian territory and for the republics concerned to join the
NPT as non-nuclear states.
Belarus is implementing that agreement, but Ukraine has been dragging its
feet and seems less and less inclined to do so, while Kazakhstan is biding
its time. Kazakhstan has the main ex-Soviet nuclear test sites, but both
they and the weapons themselves are mainly controlled and administered by
ethnic Russians. This is not the case with Ukraine, which increasingly sees
itself as under threat from Russia. Only this month, for instance, the
Russian parliament laid claim to Sebastopol, a Black Sea port in Ukraine.
Not surprisingly, Ukrainian leaders - especially, perhaps, prime minister
Leonid Kuchma, whose previous career was spent manufacturing nuclear
missiles - believe they can obtain operational control of the strategic
weapons on their territory without too much difficulty. They are
increasingly tempted to regard them as the ultimate deterrent against
Russian aggression.
British and French leaders, who for years have proclaimed the vital
importance for their national security of an independent nuclear deterrent,
though living at the opposite end of Europe from Russia and enjoying the
security of Nato, are hardly well placed to dissuade Ukraine from adopting a
similar doctrine.
In the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, the house magazine of the US foreign
policy establishment, the Chicago political scientist John J Mearsheimer -
well-known exponent of the cold-blooded 'realist' view of international
relations - argues that a Ukrainian nuclear deterrent would be good for both
Ukrainian and broader European security. The opposite case - that a nuclear
Ukraine would be bankrupt, isolated and vulnerable to a pre-emptive strike -
is put by Steven E Miller of Harvard. To my mind it is the more persuasive,
but I am not the one that needs persuading.
Ukrainians will not be impressed by fine words from western powers which
have failed to come to the aid of Bosnia. Probably little short of an offer
of full Nato membership would sway Ukraine now. That suggestion would be
instantly rejected in all western capitals as destabilising and provocative.
But it is time we decided which is more destabilising and, long term, more
dangerous: to extend the western collective security system eastwards, or to
wait for proliferation to spread eastern insecurity westwards.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Time to make up or break up: Will British Gas be dismantled
or remain a privatised monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cedric Brown, the burly chief executive of British Gas, has come a long
way since he was a gas engineer in Yorkshire. He heads one of Britain's
largest companies at a crucial time, and he is about to face the biggest
test of his career. This week Mr Brown will discover whether his gamble of
submitting British Gas to an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission has paid off, or whether it will result in the break-up of the
company.
Mr Brown made the unprecedented request a year ago when he assumed the post
of chief executive. It was a measure of his frustration over the constant
bickering and lack of agreement about pricing and supply between the company
and its regulator, Ofgas.
But the blunt Yorkshireman's high-risk strategy of opening up British Gas to
a full-scale investigation could backfire. If the commission recommends
breaking the company up into smaller concerns - as Ofgas has suggested - Mr
Brown could lose the fiefdom over which he presides. The question is: will
parts of British Gas be sold off so that the household supply market can be
opened up to competition?
The inquiry has put Mr Brown in the awkward position of defending British
Gas's monopoly over household supply in front of an inquiry panel of
free-market academics and legal experts. He has submitted a pile of evidence
5ft high to the commission, which has spoken to about 550 interested
parties.
At the same time, British Gas has mounted a charm offensive on government
ministers who will decide whether to enshrine the commission's verdict in
law. If British Gas were to retain its monopoly, some ministers believe, it
would only be because Mr Brown's arguments had won the day. But with
electricity supply partially to be opened to competitors next year and fully
in 1998, and with British Gas's monopoly already in the government's sights
before the commission was called in, Mr Brown is rowing against the tide.
British Gas claims it has recently been won over by the case for
competition. Mr Brown says he is not averse to the idea of a freer market
for households, but emphasises the need to tread carefully to ensure that
neither customers nor shareholders lose out.
However, he has warned the commission that an end to British Gas's monopoly
could throw up several important problems. The three main issues are safety,
security of supply, and price. Safety is at risk, argue Mr Brown and his gas
engineers, if any company can feed into and take out from the pipeline
network as much gas as it likes. If too much gas is taken out of the system
at any one moment, air could be sucked in, causing an explosion.
Less dramatic, but just as important for many customers, is the guaranteed
supply provided by British Gas, Mr Brown says. If competition takes off and
rival suppliers run out of gas on cold days in winter, customers signed up
to those suppliers could see gas for their boilers switched off with little
warning.
Stretching this point further, Mr Brown believes that, in an open market,
there could be customers that no company wants to supply - those with large
debts or in remote regions, for example. At the moment, British Gas must
supply anyone who wants gas, but that obligation could end, along with the
monopoly.
Mr Brown's final, and perhaps most powerful, point is that prices for the
pensioner with one gas burner could double if market forces were introduced.
A third of his 18m household customers currently subsidise the other
two-thirds who use less gas.
His arguments are rejected by competitors already wresting market share from
British Gas in the industrial sector. In a study sponsored by a group of
rival companies, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand put forward a plan for
opening up the domestic market without disruption.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand suggested that competition could be introduced into
household supply gradually from 1995 over a five-year period. The plan
suggests testing all competitors on their suitability to supply household
customers - ensuring they have adequate financial resources and gas
supplies. All companies would be obliged to supply any customer approaching
them, guaranteeing a certain minimum standard of service.
A financial bond lodged with the regulator, or access to emergency gas
supplies, could help ensure that no company cuts off any home gas supply
because it has run out of gas.
One of the companies sponsoring the Coopers plan, Alliance Gas, has provided
further assurances, suggesting it can fulfil the functions currently
performed by British Gas and still cut prices to all users by an average of
Pounds 50 a year, or 10 per cent of bills. In any case, the price cap
keeping British Gas's household price increases to a minimum will need to be
in place until competition has been established.
With competitors effectively able to answer two of British Gas's objections,
the safety issue remains the real drawback to a liberalised market. But many
of British Gas's safety fears could be removed by having a central pipeline
company responsible for balancing supply and demand. This company could have
access to a source of gas in order to regulate gas flows and for use in
emergencies.
The pipeline company would have to be separate from the rest of British
Gas's business. Otherwise, some gas companies and the regulator believe, the
development of competition could be hampered. A separation of pipelines from
trading - either by accounting separation or a total sell-off - would ensure
that British Gas's own marketing operations are not given more favourable
access to the transport system than its competitors.
This is another area on which the commission must pronounce. It is reviewing
not only a sell-off of pipelines, but a wholesale break-up of the company
into smaller regional units as has been suggested by Ofgas.
Mr Brown contends that fully dismantling the company would cost Pounds 3bn
over 10 years. It is estimated that a move to split off the pipelines would
cost about Pounds 300m over the same period. This is because some costs
would be duplicated if the company were split up.
The high potential costs of break-up could sway the government to opt for
the status quo. British Gas has already agreed with the Office of Fair
Trading to separate accounting procedures between pipelines and its trading
operations by this September.
An important indicator of the future profitability of the pipeline network
will be the rate of return set by the commission. Mr Brown believes that 4.5
per cent - the present rate - is too low. Ofgas reckons it is too high. This
disagreement was one reason why Mr Brown requested the commission review.
Mr Brown hoped to gain a more stable environment for the business over the
next couple of years. He says constant arguing with Ofgas and a changing
regulatory agenda were making it difficult to plan. To avoid further
disputes, the commission's solution must help to soothe relations between
the company and its regulator, and therefore must also be acceptable to
Ofgas. Some of the abrasiveness may be removed anyway with the retirement of
Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas and scourge of British Gas, in
October.
Ofgas and Mr Brown are not the only parties awaiting the commission's
decision. The rest of the energy sector is also eager to know the verdict,
because it will indicate how far the government wants to encourage
competition elsewhere in the privatised utilities.

However tedious and repetitive television may be at the moment, you can
hardly complain of lack of choice on radio, at least where music is
concerned. At 7.00 in 'Folk On 2' Jim Lloyd introduces a group which has a
new name, the Band of Hope, though four of its members have known one
another for decades: Martin Carthy, Dave Swarbrick, John Kirkpatrick, and
Roy Bailey. Steafan Hannigan joined slightly later to add 'a new dimension'.
In the pop world of the 1970s they would have been known as a 'super group'.
At 7.30 in BBC Proms Radio 3 offers one of Mahler's little efforts, the 6th
Symphony, which lasts a mere 90 minutes, played by the BBC Welsh Symphony
Orchestra under Tadaaki Otaka. If that seems too hefty, Classic FM's Evening
Concert (8.00) is lighter: the Brahms Variations on a Theme by Haydn,
Franck's Symphonic Variations, and Reger's Variations and Fugue on a theme
of Mozart.
On The Line (8.30 BBC2) investigates overtraining by top athletes. New
research suggests that it may weaken the immune system dangerously, even
fatally.

There is something irresistible about backstage plays. Being taken behind
the scenes is like being shown how a clock works. And to give attention to
the unhymned components of theatre - the dresser, the chorus line - is to
cast judicious light on lives of the obscure. Though Richard Crane's Under
the Stars is no great example of this genre, it is satisfying simply because
it is all about understudies.
Stella and Regina are covering two Great (and Old) Actresses of the London
stage during a West End run. Out there, on the stage we never see, the two
stars, 'Trixie' and 'the Dame,' are playing Helen and Clytemnestra, long
after the Trojan War, in a preposterous trough of verse drama called Helen
in Argos. Down here, at the other end of the tannoy system, Stella and
Regina listen and wait. Stella is all method, motivation, and neurosis; and
she never knows all her lines. Regina, who has understudied the Dame for 25
years, is an old pro who can duplicate everything the Dame does; but, since
she never goes on, she concentrates on knitting and shopping at Sainsbury.
For so plotless a set-up, Crane has worked too hard to provide a plot.
(Trixie gets ill and faints onstage, only to recover and carry on, before
Stella has a chance to finish identifying with Helen and to get onstage in
her stead. The director, assuming Trixie will be hospitalised, brings in a
Known Actress to cover the role of Helen.) And each character is too much of
a theatrical cartoon. Stella's feckless clinging to method, Regina's dogged
insistence on routine - these are too coarsely exaggerated. The director is
merely a smug creep, the Known Actress merely the standard ambitious bitch.
The Dame and Trixie, whose voices we hear over the tannoy, are equally
ludicrous, but there is fun to be had in listening to the (recorded) voices
of Patricia Routledge and June Whitfield intoning the ghastly verse of Helen
in Argos. Routledge (as the Dame playing Clytemnestra) belts out her lines
in a beefy basso profundo - con molto vibrato; Whitfield (as Trixie as
Helen) quavers hers out in a tremolo so massive that it sounds like a trill
spanning a minor third - or like yodelling.
Connie Booth and Pam Ferris play Stella and Regina effectively, in
diametrically opposed styles. Booth is fey, Ferris fierce; Booth all
self-obsessed sensitivity, Ferris all practical sense. But, under Matthew
Francis's direction, this backstage world hangs fire. Both (especially
Ferris) occasionally follow the playwright into the temptation of hamming up
straight material; the pacing (especially Booth's) is sometimes
insufficiently natural and too pat. There is greater drama in this situation
than Crane knew how to discover; and there is more truth in these roles than
Booth and Ferris have yet disclosed.
At the Greenwich Theatre, until August 28.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: Of course, we never watch it . . . - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every few years we are treated to a dramatic report which purports to show
that television viewing is on the decrease. The most recent comes from the
Henley Centre For Forecasting, but the source never seems to make much
difference. The story, as interpreted by newspapers anyway, is always the
same: interest has peaked and television is on the skids. The funny thing is
that each successive report begins its scare story of tumbling figures from
a larger audience base, higher viewing hours and a bigger total advertising
income. What on earth is going on?
Several things, perhaps. First, like is not necessarily being compared with
like, because television keeps changing. The short history of the medium has
been a story of improvement in home reception and changed technology in
delivery systems. When the standard scare story of shrinking viewing figures
hit the US a few years ago it turned out that while the ratings share of the
big three networks had indeed slipped, the reason was not that people were
watching less television but that a larger share was being taken by cable
and video. Viewers were spending as long or longer than ever in front of
their sets.
Second, newspapers are, naturally enough, keen to play up any hint that the
advance of the new, and worryingly competitive, mass medium has been halted.
After all, total newspaper sales really have been slipping ever since the
arrival of television. Third, though probably most important in Britain, is
The Au Pair Syndrome. This is the habit of the middle class intelligentsia
of pretending not to watch television at all. In the 1950s and 1960s the
claim was 'We only have a set to help the au pair with her English'. Today
the claim varies - we only have it for the news, only for watching opera
cassettes, only to help the Filipinos with their English - but the snobbery
is unchanged.
On the whole people in socio-economic groups A and B do watch less than
those in groups C, D and E. This scarcely seems surprising: doctors and
businessmen often have jobs which keep them out late, and compared with
nurses or centre lathe turners they are better able to afford seats at the
opera or dinner in a restaurant. The fact remains that though they may watch
less, they still watch a lot - and experience suggests that they are ashamed
of this. When, like so many, they switch on to watch the Six O'Clock News
and then stay for Top Of The Pops they blame television for its triviality
rather than themselves for lack of will power or discrimination.
The result is that every time a report such as Henley's appears it is
announced with headlines that ring with glee. This one claims, moreover,
that the 'decline' is largely among the middle classes. The implication is
that television is turning into a yob medium, watched only by the socially
inadequate; just what the au pair employing classes always said. But is it
not also similar to what this column has been saying for the past two or
three years? Have there not been numerous warnings here that the new
Thatcherite broadcasting legislation would lead to more tabloid television,
more intense ratings contests and a consequent lowering of standards? But
there is, surely, a huge difference between trying to hold the line against
an expected decline and condemning the medium out of hand.
On the rare occasions when somebody stands up for television they are
invariably challenged: go on then, name something worth watching, especially
at this time of the year. Yet the fact is that even in the murkiest depths
of a repeat-laden summer there is (so far, anyway; the full effects of that
Thatcherite legislation are yet to be seen) still more of quality to watch
on British television than any normal person could find time for,
particularly anyone using a video recorder.
In drama BBC2 has just finished screening one of the greatest works of
television ever created, and probably one of the most important pieces of
fiction of the second half of the 20th century: A Second Heimat (extensively
reviewed in this column on April 14 and last Wednesday). It lasted 26 hours
and was enthralling and almost embarrassingly involving. Watching it all
took dedication, but the rewards were tremendous. ITV has shown the first
three episodes in Frank Stubbs Promotes which is no Heimat, but is more
enjoyable, funnier, and a better reflector of its period than 75 per cent of
today's novels. So far it has trodden a little too determinedly in the
footsteps of Minder but Timothy Spall is giving a delightful performance in
the central role of an over-ambitious ticket tout.
In documentaries ITV is showing Kinnock: The Inside Story, a four-part
account of the political life of the former Labour leader. The first two
episodes have been extraordinarily powerful examples of the type of modern
history which causes increasing jealousy and petulance among the sort of
academic book historians who would have us believe they only ever catch a
glimpse of the television in the JCR. From Orgreave Coke Depot to the night
of the 1985 election, these programmes have brought history vividly to life.
More valuable still has been Kinnock's voice-over description of his
thoughts or reactions to the crises seen before us, from the leadership
contest to the Militant showdown. But what makes the series truly compelling
is Kinnock's devastating honesty about his own mistakes and failures. BBC2
meanwhile is showing a documentary series made with American co-producers
about the development of the oil industry, The Prize, which, as well as
being highly informative, is often more exciting and entertaining than
Dallas (reviewed here on July 3).
Parliament's - or perhaps John Major's - handling of the Maastricht affair
may be judged by posterity as shameful and inept, but television's current
affairs departments delivered the crucial moments into our homes last week
in a manner that was gripping enough to keep some of us out of bed until
3.00am. Jeremy Paxman handled the real-time coverage of bedlam in the House
of Commons with all the professionalism you would expect (though the rule
about a single static camera angle from behind the bar of the House as the
tellers go through must surely be changed) but it was Vincent Hanna who took
the honours. No doubt his late night job on Channel 4, of marshalling
instant comment, was easier than that of Paxman who had to fly the Newsnight
studio by the seat of his pants. Nevertheless Hanna triumphed not only
because of his political knowledge and insight but because he brought a
steady flow of wit to the proceedings. Invaluable.
Last week also brought one of those programmes which can shift your entire
perception of the world. I remember clearly, not long after joining the FT
20 years ago, watching a programme about the technical and social
implications of a new invention called the microchip. At the time its
revelations seemed truly staggering though today, of course, they would be
mundane. David Lomax's report in last Thursday's Business Matters on BBC2
about the development of Guangdong province in southern China had a
similarly mind-blowing effect. Most of us had already heard, no doubt, about
economic strides in China but the detail in this report - there are now
17,000 part-time Avon reps in Guangdong; so far most factories may be
primitive, but the staff work 10 hours a day, six days a week, perhaps for
12; they are buying Panasonic televisions and fashionable clothes; drug
trafficking, bribery and traffic jams are rocketing - suddenly made you
realise where countries like the UK and even the US may stand in, say, 2003.
Last month we had Wimbledon from the BBC, this month the Tour de France from
Channel 4. On Sunday BBC2 began a season of Summer Dance with Ballanchine's
'Serenade' and 'Western Symphony'. Of course more would be even better, and
of course some evenings at present seem like deserts unless you plan ahead
and create oases with your video recorder. But, so far, the familiar claim
that there is nothing on the box for the more demanding or intelligent
viewer is still hooey. And although there may one day be a collapse in
television viewing, personal experience suggests it has not happened yet.
Average viewing per head of the population in the third week of June this
year, according to BARB, was 22 hours 39 minutes. Last year it was 22 hours
38 minutes. Ten years ago the figure was 16 hours 54 minutes. Some slide.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: A pretty little Prom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the television broadcast of the opening night of this year's Proms
there were complaints from viewers. Not about the music, or the standard of
performance. They were upset that the singers that night were not very
attractive in close-up, which seems to confirm a trend in how the public
regards classical musicians.
It is no longer enough to play or sing well. For popular esteem, of the kind
that suits the mass media, the performer has to look good too. As though the
BBC had anticipated the audience's reaction, it chose its second Prom for
television relay cannily. The Finnish soprano Karita Mattila, statuesque,
elegantly attired, is unlikely to have prompted anything but letters of
appreciation from those who look first and listen later.
In the hall we could appreciate the glamour of her voice as well. She sang
four not very substantial Grieg songs, a nod in recognition of the
composer's 150th anniversary. All were well-known pieces, such as the
Solveig solos from Peer Gynt, sung with rather more winning simplicity by
Barbara Bonney in her Grieg recitals with piano. Mattila's strength was the
warmth and substance of her voice, which projected strongly over the
orchestral accompaniments.
The conductor, Alexander Lazarev, seemed keen to let her be heard.
Unfortunately, that was the only cause for rejoicing on the orchestral side.
The concert had opened with a dismal performance of Stravinsky's Petrushka -
no brilliance in the colours, no snap to the rhythms. Perhaps dancers at the
Bolshoy (Lazarev's artistic home) prefer the music at this speed, whereas
orchestras in the West are used to spinning through it on tip-toe, as it
were.
The BBC Symphony Orchestra stumbled on many ragged corners. (The student
orchestra that I heard at the Schleswig-Holstein Festival a couple of weeks
ago played the music with more purpose.) A little more energy informed
Tchaikovsky's Suite No 3, but not so much as to be positively exciting. It
is disappointing that the improvements at the BBCSO achieved under Andrew
Davis do not necessarily carry through when there is somebody else on the
podium.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: Charming, but charm is not enough - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an odd moment of adjustment when you return from a holiday. Instead
of mountains or monuments, there - from train or aircraft - you see the
neat, quilted English countryside, carefully laid out, domesticated. Of
course it is 'home' - but rather enclosed, and somehow tame. I felt this on
Monday night while watching The Sleeping Beauty with which the Birmingham
Royal Ballet opened its Covent Garden season. Last week, at the Coliseum,
the Kirov had shown us their Beauty. Tired and cursory as some of its
components looked, it was still a grand and spacious work of art, its manner
resonant with the importance of classical dancing. Its cast had an assurance
born of the knowledge that their theatre had seen Beauty's first
performance, and this gave dignity and clarity to their dancing.
The BRB staging has many virtues. As an exposition of the text it is, in
fact, superior to the Kirov's version: the prologue and first act, albeit
numbers are reduced, maintain a shape lacking in the Kirov's touring
production, and the Hunting scene is charmingly done. In everything, Sir
Peter Wright (and how good it is to acknowledge his recent knighthood) has
made intelligent choices in editing the ballet for his company's touring
needs. The greatest merit, though, lies in Philip Prowse's designs which
still, after a decade, strike one by their beauty, and by their wit and
thrilling sense of history. Not, I believe, since Leon Bakst's 1921 designs
for Diaghilev's Beauty staging, has costuming so brilliantly evoked a period
through the most acute sense of historical shape. Drapery, pleating, skill
in cutting, provide theatrically vivid yet accurate silhouettes. Fantasy
becomes history: figures once painted by Nattier or Rigaud come dazzlingly
alive on Prowse's own terms. Colours - gold, black, porphyry, rose Dubarry -
all contribute to the feeling of splendour. It is a superlative example of
the designer's art.
The problems of acclimatisation arrive with the dancing. The BRB artists
work well as an ensemble, and dramatic nuance is deftly pointed  - how acute
is Desmond Kelly's view of the king. But dance-style is vivacious where the
Kirov's is serene, and cosy where it might instead show us the broad
horizons of classic manner. There is something breathlessly determined about
the soloists: their dancing is ingratiating rather than commanding, as if
trying to win us on everything but dance terms. And charm is not enough.
The honourable and golden exception was Miyako Yoshida as Aurora. Here was a
radiant, absolutely assured interpretation. Yoshida's dancing is ravishing
because precise, delicate, pure. Nothing is fudged or fussed; everything
looks elegant, with artistry dedicated to the service of the choreography.
The reading is gentle, beguiling, a portrayal that must stand among the very
best the Royal Ballet has shown us. Yoshida's prince was Kevin O'Hare,
giving a gentlemanly account of the role, but careering through his solos as
if fleeing in disarray from an insurrection.
The score, from Philip Ellis and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, sounded somewhat
boxy and harried: we needed more of the Mariinsky orchestra's grandeur. The
performance running time seemed a race against the clock. And I protest
against the eliding of the first and second acts of the ballet. An interval
after Aurora's birthday celebration is essential to enable the public to
sense the passing of a hundred years. A single, helter-skelter passage of
dancing, lasting nearly 70 minutes, is like having indigestion on the Cresta
Run.
Birmingham Royal Ballet is at Covent Garden, with varied programmes, until
August 7.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Keys to an ecological crisis -
Quick action is needed to halt the destruction of large areas of the Florida
Bay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Humble, a farmer near Miami, Florida, is feeling put upon these days.
In common with other farmers in the area, Humble is still recovering from
the devastation of Hurricane Andrew last year. Now, to make matters worse,
the tomato grower is facing tentative plans by the US government to buy out
his land at what he says are sure to be unfair prices.
'They say we're killing the fish in the Florida Bay,' says Humble. 'Maybe
someone made the wrong decision to let us be here in the first place, but
now it's too late. This is our land, and they shouldn't have the right to
kick us out.'
Michael Collins, a boat owner who charters sport fishing trips around the
Florida Keys, a long strip of islands stretching south of Miami almost to
Cuba, also has a crisis on his hands. He says that he is battling a
salt-water algae bloom, 70 miles long and 30 miles deep, caused by the
mismanagement of water resources upstream.
The ecological destruction of large areas of the Florida Bay, located at the
southern tip of the state, has triggered a bitter dispute between farmers
and fishermen in the area.
As farmers near Miami siphon canal water for flood control and irrigation,
the flow of fresh water into the Florida Bay near the Keys is stemmed,
upsetting the delicate balance of salt and fresh water in the area and
killing marine life.
Recently, scientists say, the environmental damage quickened as a handful of
farmers around the Frog Pond, which provides water to the Taylor Slough
riverway, a key source of water flow for the Everglades, began to siphon
water for added flood control of their fields.
'This is an ecosystem on the verge of collapse,' says Collins. 'I've seen
millions of dead fish here. In the Keys, every industry we have, from
tourism to fishing, depends on clean water. Without it, none of us will have
jobs.'
The water that eventually reaches the Florida Bay starts around Orlando, and
flows south through agricultural lands and the swamps of the Everglades
National Park before reaching its final destination. Over the past few
years, the shrinking volume of fresh water reaching the bay has caused
significant amounts of sea grass to die, creating an algae bloom which in
turn has caused fish to die in catastrophic numbers.
'We have known about this problem for at least 20 years, and I feel the
crisis might have been prevented if action had been taken earlier,' says
Glenn Kinser, a scientist with the National Fish &amp; Wildlife Foundation in
Washington, DC.
Both the federal and state governments say they are doing their best to
address the problem. A joint task force has been formed to study options,
which include the forced purchase of farmers' lands in the area. But farmers
around the Frog Pond are angry because any government buy-out would probably
treat the land as flood-prone, rather than flood-controlled, an assessment
which would substantially lower its market value. Negotiations are moving
slowly.
'With so many factors to consider, this is not a terribly fast process,'
says John Ogden, a wildlife biologist with the Everglades National Park.
'It's not only a problem with the farmers but with the situation of the
canals. We'll have to tear out some old ones and put in new ones, and that
will cost hundreds of millions of dollars.'
The longer it takes to address the situation, say fishermen, the slimmer the
chances that the area will recover soon enough to prevent economic
devastation in the region. According to the fishing industry, shrimp catches
have already fallen by 90 per cent over the last few years, and crab and
lobster hauls are down substantially.
Even more frightening to environmentalists, hot saline water has been
detected beyond the Florida Keys in the ecologically sensitive coral reefs,
one of the largest in the world. 'The coral reef ecosystem is extremely
sensitive and is already threatened by scuba divers and other problems,'
says Thomas Bancroft, a scientist with the National Audubon Society. 'We
must keep that system protected.'
The problem, say scientists studying the area, began shortly after the
second world war, when state and federal agencies began to install drainage
canals in southern Florida. Today, there are 1,400 miles of drainage canals,
diverting 970bn gallons of water a year. The canals made way for large-scale
development, allowing suburban sprawl to spread further south from Miami and
pushing farmers closer to the environmentally sensitive Everglades.
'This area is suffering from 40 years of water deprivation,' says Joseph
Zieman, a professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia
and a specialist in the Florida Bay problem.
To make matters worse, the Everglades are also under threat from pesticide
pollution created by sugar farmers even further upstream. Sugar-growers and
state and government officials have tentatively agreed to a plan to reduce
fertiliser runoff. However, details of the proposal are still being worked
out.
The crisis in the Florida Bay is particularly shocking to many because it
took place in an area that was thought to be protected as parkland.
'Many people assumed that by setting up national parks and protecting
everything within their boundaries, our wilderness areas were safe,' says
Ogden.
'But in a park like the Everglades - or almost any national park in the US
for that matter - water flows and air flows coming from outside the park
impact us directly. We need to reassess park management and go outside our
boundaries to resolve environmental problems. This means more involvement
with regional planning, for instance.'
No one knows how long it will take to reverse the environmental devastation
in the Florida Bay. Even if the source of the problems is eliminated
immediately, many ecologists feel it will be many years before any visible
recovery sets in. For those inhabitants of the Keys, who depend on fishing
and tourism to make a living, that will be too late.

FT  28 JUL 93 / People: Alcatel entices BT's man in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK ambitions of Alcatel NV, the French telecommunications equipment
supplier, reached a new peak yesterday, with the announcement that it has
merged two of its UK subsidiaries and appointed a BT executive to run them.
John Baker, BT's sales manager for leading business customers in Europe, has
been appointed managing director of Alcatel Network Systems UK, an
amalgamation of Alcatel's existing UK network systems division and Telettra
UK, the UK microwave and line transmission division of the Italian group
Telettra Spa acquired by Alcatel in 1991.
Coming a week after Alcatel offered Pounds 600m for STC Submarine Systems,
the UK-based undersea telecommunications cable arm of Northern Telecom, the
Canadian supplier, the move underlines Alcatel's determination to make
inroads into the UK market.
Unlike virtually all his French counterparts, Baker climbed up through the
ranks. He joined the Post Office straight from school as a trainee
apprentice in 1964, gaining qualifications through night school, then as a
mature student at Essex University.
With 1,000 employees and annual sales of more than Pounds 100m, Alcatel has
a significant UK presence even before the STC acquisition.
'The world's number one player should be in the world's number one market,'
Baker says, neatly complimenting his masters old and new.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Putting money on efficiency -
NatWest Bank is striving for greater environmental awareness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is making a strong pitch to become the UK's
greenest clearer.
The bank has just published the results of a two-year environmental audit
which it claims is the first of its kind by any bank.
The report is not the stuff that will set environmentalist pulses racing.
Banks do not spew filth into the atmosphere or pollute rivers, nor do they
chop down forests or hunt whales. Their impact on the environment is far
more subtle. Think only of the amount of paper that a bank employing 100,000
people uses each year, or of the size of its vehicle fleet.
The bulk of the 25-page report is therefore about how NatWest can cut its
appetite for resources by using less paper, or switching to cars with
smaller engines.
It also looks at the 4,250 buildings which the bank owns around the world to
see how they could be made more energy efficient.
Much of this will strike people as obvious, if not rather trivial. The
report even says that employees should use the photocopier less and switch
off the lights.
One of the main achievements highlighted is the installation of small waste
paper compactors in 1,850 branches which will save the group Pounds 640,000
a year.
However, Lord Alexander, the bank's chairman, and Derek Wanless, NatWest's
group chief executive, make clear in a statement of environmental policy
that there is more to NatWest's approach than age-old exhortations to staff
to economise.
The aim is to create a stronger environmental awareness within the group and
apply this not just to the bank's own operations, but also to its suppliers
and its customers.
They say: 'We recognise that environmental risks should be part of the
normal checklist of risk assessment and management. As part of our credit
risk assessment, where appropriate, environmental impact assessments may be
requested.
'We will encourage our suppliers to pursue best practice. Our procurement
policy will take account of this.'
Hilary Thompson, manager of NatWest's environmental unit, says this does not
mean that suppliers and customers will immediately be struck off the list if
they do not meet NatWest's green standards.
'But we hope they move in that direction,' she says.
'We want to encourage customers to report on what they're doing. It makes
risk assessment easier.'
But she also expects that NatWest itself will become more efficient as a
result of the audit. The identified savings amount to several million pounds
a year. 'Just looking at things afresh can help,' she says.
The audit is not the end of the exercise. NatWest intends to publish annual
environmental reports, and to incorporate environmental factors into its
planning.
But Thompson admits that this cannot be done by diktat from headquarters.
Staff must have the incentive to become greener, and she thinks that this
will come through the benefits that greater efficiency will bring to their
departmental budgets.
Some sample environmental targets include:
Introduce a supplier environmental appraisal system during 1993.
Increase the proportion of diesel-engined bank cars to 34 per cent by the
end of 1993.
Achieve a 5 per cent reduction in photocopying in 1993 as against 1992.
Educate staff to expect information to be screen-based rather than
paper-based.
Search for new ways to increase the utilisation of soyabean/water-based
inks.
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the potential for further use of
alternative energy sources, for example solar power.

FT  28 JUL 93 / People: Campbell Lutyens loses Hudson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just days after Joseph Perella left New York investment bank Wasserstein
Perella, David Hudson, a partner in a much smaller British enterprise
Campbell Lutyens Hudson has jumped ship. Hudson, 48, is joining a former
Kleinwort Benson colleague John MacArthur at the latter's firm MacArthur &amp;
Co.
Campbell Lutyens Hudson says that the parting is amicable, but that Hudson
had developed a strong interest in the expert witness field, an area,
however, in which the partnership felt it did not want to be involved.
Expert witnesses are often called upon to testify against other merchant
banks, for example in takeovers that are perceived by one or other party to
have gone wrong.
Hudson himself says that CLH has grown rather large for his tastes, that he
prefers work of 'a more intellectual nature', and that he did not want to
become 'the corporate animal' that would have been necessary had he stayed.
However, he still retains his 'substantial' shareholding, and his name stays
on the CLH letterhead for the foreseeable future.
MacArthur and Hudson were together at KB in the late 1960s; one of the other
two board members, Nigel Christie, is also an old KB hand. Hudson later
moved to Samuel Montagu, as deputy head of corporate finance and head of
international banking. He moved to James Capel as head of corporate finance
and then on to Henry Ansbacher as chief executive, before joining CLH.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Threat to rural England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development of rural land in England cannot continue at the current pace and
the government should conduct a far-reaching review of planning and farming
policies to try to protect the countryside, according to the Council for the
Protection of Rural England.
Tony Burton, senior planner at the CPRE, will launch the organisation's new
study on the changes in regional land use between 1945 and 1990* today with
a call for the government to revise its planning policies so that less rural
land is used for development.
The scale of development and land changes across England is 'unsustainable',
Burton argues. 'If we carry on using land at this rate we will have lost a
resource the general public value as their countryside and we should be
cherishing for the future.'
In England, as a whole, the urban area has grown by more than 700,000
hectares since 1945. In addition, almost 30 per cent of rough grazing has
been lost. The south-east has lost the most countryside to the urban jungle.
Since 1960 the number of people supported by each hectare of urban land has
declined by a fifth from 31 to 25 people.
The CPRE is critical of road proposals that encourage this sort of urban
sprawl. Burton said it was concerned about the government's decision to
widen the M25 orbital motorway around London. 'These sort of proposals
encourage de-centralisation and the M25 decision can only exacerbate that
trend.'
A comprehensive review of local, regional and national planning policies to
protect the countryside and make more efficient use of land in urban areas
should be conducted, the CPRE says. Green belts should be protected,
particularly where they are under threat from local authorities. The CPRE
wants farmland to be better protected for its environmental as well as its
agricultural value.

Bristol &amp; West, which has a network of 180 building society branches, plus
the Hamptons Estates Agency, Bristol &amp; West Property Services, and a growing
number of high street financial centres, now has a 'fixed-time' service
contract with Unisys, the computer and information solutions company, for
the maintenance of its communications network.
In the event of a computer breakdown, the society can directly access the
Unisys engineering network, which logs calls to field engineers. The
contract specifies that Unisys would pay a penalty to Bristol &amp; West if it
fails to meet specified service levels - a feature that few other service
companies were prepared to offer when tenders were submitted last year.
High priority calls are guaranteed 'a fix in six hours,' says Unisys.
Service performance is reviewed at monthly meetings between Bristol &amp; West

Uncertainties over EC directive - European rules raise complex questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION over the role of the European Community's Acquired Rights
Directive in the contracting out of services has spawned a cottage industry
of conferences and legal advice.
The directive is better known in Britain by the acronym Tupe, after the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations which
implemented it in the UK.
The directive protects the jobs and conditions of employees when their jobs
are transferred from one employer to another.
Although the directive has been part of British law since 1981, it was only
at the end of last year that it became clear that the protection extended to
some cases of contracting out from the public to the private sector.
Given that the profit margins of private contractors have often been
dependent on cutting the employment and pay of those transferred, this
realisation has cast a long shadow over the whole contracting-out process.
Nearly one year on, the confusion has not been cleared up, thanks in part to
genuine legal uncertainty and in part to the British government's cryptic
and defensive attitude towards Tupe.
There are two important questions about Tupe: what exactly do the
regulations require and where do they apply? Both questions are difficult to
answer definitively, but some facts seem clear enough.
Tupe requires that staff cannot be dismissed as the result of the transfer
of an undertaking, although it may be possible to dismiss people soon after
for other reasons.
The regulations also insist that terms and conditions of employment cannot
be changed without consent and that union recognition must be carried over,
too.
THERE is less clarity about whether pensions are covered. It had been
assumed that they were not covered, but a leaked government letter recently
indicated that they might be.
Industrial tribunal cases on this point are pending but they may not be
sufficient to clear up the confusion. Pensions are important because they
are invariably much more generous in the public sector.
Exactly where the regulations apply depends on the definition of a
'transfer' and an 'undertaking.' Recent judgements of the European Court of
Justice suggest EC judges favour a broad definition of both a transfer and
an undertaking which would capture a broad range of the services which are
contracted out. It is even possible to be caught when an organisation
terminates its existing service and buys in a new service provided by new
employees, as the High Court judgement in Kenny v South Manchester College
underlined.
The government's guidance on Tupe stressed that it is most likely to apply
where the new employer employs substantially the same staff to do the same
work as before, using the same premises and the same equipment. But that now
appears too narrow a definition and, in practice, the government has
gradually accepted that Tupe covers a significant proportion of
contracting-out cases.
Many trade unionists and lawyers would go further - 'the transfers under
compulsory competitive tendering which are or will be excluded from Tupe are
likely to be the exception rather than the rule,' says Mr Raymond Jeffers of
Linklaters &amp; Paines.
Important judgements due soon include that on the contracting out of
Eastbourne's refuse collection.
More industrial tribunal cases are also likely to start coming through in
the next few months. But the courts will not provide a single, definitive,
judgement.
Tupe does not mean the end of contracting out but it does complicate
matters. Some contractors have made it clear that if they are unable to
substantially reduce staff and cut wages and pensions they will not be able
to bid for public sector contracts. Others, especially in higher value-added
fields like information technology, have fewer problems and often say they
plan to improve pay and conditions.
WHAT seems to be happening in practice is that where Tupe applies in central
government and the National Health Service, the government is cutting staff
numbers through voluntary redundancy before contracting out, thereby
reducing the liability of private contractors.
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CDC Research and a lobbyist for
private contractors, says that is a key advantage for contractors - 'if
redundancy can be solved, then the rest is manageable,' he says.
In local government it is more complex. Many Labour-controlled authorities
have seen Tupe as a way of fending off government regulations on CCT that
they do not like. All authorities have now been warned by the government
that they cannot specify whether Tupe applies or not in bidding documents.
The government says it is up to contractors to decide whether Tupe applies
or not.
The difficulty is that if a contractor decides that it does not apply, but a
court subsequently decides that it does, it is not clear whether the
contractor or the local authority must carry the cost. Local authorities
fear that they will be left with large Tupe-related liabilities (still
virtually impossible to insure against) that they cannot afford.
Mr Christopher Chope, the former Local Government Minister and a pioneer of
contracting out in Wandsworth, believes the government's failure to 'take a
clear line' on Tupe has made it harder for all concerned.
'They should adapt to the reality of Tupe and make the best of it. The
cost-savings may not be so dramatic but the private sector will still be
able to improve performance through better management,' he says.
To compensate for the lower returns the contractors should be given longer
contract periods, he says. He also suggests that as Tupe protects jobs and
pay there is no need for in-house bids. The government currently encourages
such bids but many observers believe that as they are not covered by Tupe
they have an unfair advantage over external bids that are.
Despite the change of government in France it seems highly unlikely that the
government will succeed in getting a Tupe 'opt-out' for contracting out at
the EC level. And to make matters worse, it may also face retrospective
claims from the tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs or
suffered a deterioration in pay and conditions as a result of
contracting-out over the past decade.
However, such claims are unlikely to succeed, as even some union officials
admit, and the government will certainly tough it out.

Facilities management: benefits in the area of information technology
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FACILITIES management typically involves contracting out the running of
computers and systems. Equipment and staff generally transfer to the
supplier, although they might continue working at the customer's premises
for a while. Here are the benefits, according to a survey by the CMG
services group:
Management freed to focus on core business                 77 per cent
Reduced headcount                                          70 per cent
Greater financial control of operations                    48 per cent
Reduced running costs                                      47 per cent
Staff management problems reduced                          45 per cent
Improved service levels                                    43 per cent
Staff shortage/ no recruitment problems                    43 per cent
Office space requirements are reduced                      41 per cent
Information technology (IT) moved from
  capital item to expense item                             33 per cent
More flexible capacity and back-up                         33 per cent
All IT systems from one supplier                           27 per cent
Reduced risk                                               24 per cent
When asked about the disadvantages of facilities management, 40 per cent of
users said there were no real cost reductions. However, there were bigger
votes for the benefits than for the disadvantages.
Other disadvantages mentioned were difficulties in defining boundaries of
responsibility (35 per cent), loss of in-house expertise (27 per cent), poor
understanding by the supplier of the client's business (17 per cent), poor
accountability (16 per cent) and loss of control of IT services and strategy
(14 per cent).

Freedom to focus on core business - Case study: Whitbread information
systems and the FI Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASING number of UK companies see the need to focus on their core
business while 'outsourcing' the supply of solutions and services in
information technology to a third party.
For example, Whitbread, the food, drinks and leisure group, and the FI
Group, a leading computer systems and training company, has this year formed
a Pounds 12.65m strategic partnership to provide system development and
maintenance for Whitbread IT systems over the next five years.
The FI Group, based at Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, with offices in nine
other centres in the UK, took on a hundred employees from Whitbread's
central development and support facility in February. Whitbread's systems
services director, Mr Fraser Winterbottom, says the contract allows the
company to focus on its long-term, strategic IT requirements, 'rather than
utilising its people to deliver technical solutions.'
The operation of Whitbread's data centres at Luton and Sheffield and
communication networks are not affected and the company will keep a small
team for business analysis, project management and PC developments. Mr
Winterbottom believes that 'the key benefits of Whitebread's partnership
with FI are that it enables us to focus our management attention on how we
use systems to support the business - and that, over the next five years,
we'll gradually move from a fixed-cost base for IT services to more variable
costs, depending on business needs.'
The partnership is the largest single contract won by FI so far. FI is one
of a small number of European specialist vendors that have been successful
in capturing stand-alone applications maintenance contracts, according to
the industry research group, Input*
FOR the financial year ending April, 1992, FI Group achieved revenues of
Pounds 24.9m. Its support maintenance revenues of Pounds 10m put the company
in second place to Hoskyns in the UK applications maintenance management
market. The Whitbread agreement applies purely to people and applications
systems software and not to the hardware operations at which remain under
Whitbread's management.
At the time of the transfer, Hilary Cropper, FI's chief executive, said: 'We
are protecting the employees' rights and offering them long-term career
opportunities with a developing systems company.
'Whitbread was looking for a partner who could achieve that - and they were
aware that on a long-term basis they couldn't attract the expertise and
know-how needed to develop their future IT needs.'
More than half of the newly-transferred Whitbread staff purchased shares in
FI in April.
FI has set up a new division called FI Partners to exploit similar business
opportunities. The group also operates a range of services, such as
'Mainstay' for applications support and maintenance; 'Software Factory' for
developing both proprietary and open systems solutions; plus IT training and
recruitment of IT professionals.
Lyn Barrat, director of FI Partners, says: 'The critical success factors in
partnership deals are not only a sound contract, but establishing a close
relationship, dealing openly and meeting expectations. This can mean
open-book accounting and profit-sharing.
'It certainly needs a clear definition of the service required and the key
performance indicators. It means building into the service level agreement
the flexibility and responsiveness to meet changing needs. At the end of the
day, it's about getting it right - both for your customers and your people.'
While offering a branded application support and maintenance service, FI
emphasises the importance of the management process. The group is successful
in the financial services sector - it has maintenance contracts with with
Midland Montagu's foreign exchange dealing systems; Britannia Life, the
Scottish insurance group; and with Barclays Bank for support of its
MasterCard, Gateway and Interchange system.
Overall, the FI Group believes that applications' maintenance management
'should provide a cost-reduction for the same level of service or a higher
level of service for the same cost.'

Strong emphasis on partnership - The Private Sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN the United States, it was the public sector
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
notably the federal government - which got the contracting-out bandwagon
rolling; the private sector's enthusiasm for 'outsourcing' largely followed
on.
In the UK it has been the other way around. The private sector has been
outsourcing for years. Local government began doing so with most of its
existing in-house services in the late 1980s, at the dictat of central
government. But Whitehall has only just started taking the medicine itself.
Contracting-out trends in the private sector can be summarised under two
headings: 'widening' and 'deepening'.
The last decade has seen an intensification of the trend towards hiving off
or buying-in of services not integral to a company's own line of business,
widening the range of activities contracted out.
A decade ago, it was mostly functions like catering and cleaning which
attracted the contractors. Now, increasingly, it extends to services
previously considered 'strategic', like computing and information
technology; and also to those like telecommunications which were previously
thought simple to manage in-house, but have become anything but that with
new technology and growing competition.
With diversification has come the second trend: the desire not just to
hive-off services, but to franchise the management of the contractors, and
to seek to bring in companies with know-how and state-of-the-art products to
improve overall performance through their services in a particular area. In
stark contrast to the motivation for contracting-out in the public sector,
increasingly in the private sector the drive for improvement and
collaboration is a higher priority than simple cost-savings.
Helen Anderson, marketing manager for Data Sciences, a leading UK facilities
management supplier to both sectors, says: 'The public sector tends to be
more cost-oriented, whereas for companies increasingly that is not the main
thing: they are looking for a contractor that can demonstrate partnership
and bring something genuinely new to the table.'
It is almost impossible to find a service from the boardroom to the basement
which is not contracted out somewhere. Telecommunications, a new entrant to
the 'outsourcing' market, exemplifies the trend.
Traditionally, most large companies had their own internal private phone
networks, while smaller ones simply paid the BT bill. But the cost of
replacing private network equipment is rising steadily, life-cycles are
falling as the range of available services multiplies, and competition in
the telecoms market is intensifying by the month. Both Mercury and BT now
have managed servicing units which provide and manage private networks.
The management aspect was critical to BT securing one of its largest orders
to date - a Pounds 5m contract to run and upgrade Thorn EMI's internal UK
network. However, BT is not content with UK networks alone. In partnership
with MCI, the second largest US carrier, it has just launched an ambitious
venture - competing against a similar one unveiled a month earlier by AT&amp;T,
the US giant - to offer a one-stop telecoms global outsourcing service to
the world's transnationals.
'This is the shape of telecoms to come,' boasts Iain Vallance, BT's
chairman. Exit the company which just makes sure the phones work.
On the 'deepening' front, the market is growing for facilities management
companies able to oversee a range of contracts.
MR FELIPPO SARTI, a director of Symonds, an 115-strong facilities management
company which manages 600 locations across the UK, says: 'The pressure is on
to co-ordinate - it's no longer a case of one department hiving-off the
cleaning and another the catering, companies want to integrate their
outsourcing operation.'
Recent Symonds contracts include a consulting service to establish Cable and
Wireless's new London headquarters, a similar contract for BT's new customer
systems office in Fleet, and a total management contract for the College of
St Mark and St John in Plymouth. In a typical move for the market, Symonds
has just been bought by Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French company
which already has a large stake in local government contracts, to give it an
entry into the UK's facilities management (FM) business.
However, Mr Sarti is anxious to dispel the 'misconception' that FM companies
'will provide everything.'
He says: 'We take a management-led approach, sub-contracting services - in
many cases the majority - which we have no competence to provide directly
ourselves.'
The other aspect of 'deepening' coming to the fore is the search for a more
reciprocal relationship with contractors.
'Business re-engineering is important, making sure that companies receive
from us the IT which best meets their business needs,' says Mr Jerry Scott,
marketing manager at Computing Services Corporation, a leading independent
computing consultancy which claims to have the world's largest outsourcing
contract - Dollars 3bn over 10 years for General Dynamics' IT and related
business in the US.
CSC's biggest UK contract of late is with British Home Stores (BhS), the
retail group, part of which is to help BhS develop improved business models
for their IT function.
'BhS believe that to make themselves a more competitive retailer they need
an efficient supply chain management system, giving their suppliers direct
sales information from BhS stores so that they can rectify deficiencies
quicker, and so on. Our just is get them such a system - as well ads
managing it when it is up-and-running,' says Mr Scott.
A key contrast between the public and private sectors is that in the first
private contractors are often bidding for contracts against an in-house team
desperate to hang on; in the second, the decision to outsource is generally
a corporate one, with no intention of continuing the service in-house.
'This makes the bidding process very different,' says Mr Scott. 'It affects
the whole nature of the relationship, and explains why it tends to be less
flexible with the public sector.'
As local government moves to a second generation of private-sector
contracts, it may lead the public sector's outsourcing towards the British
Home Stores model.

Private sector suppliers gain ground in local government - Research shows
wide disparity over levels of savings of public money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE sector companies appear to be gaining ground from their early
footholds in local government on two fronts.
First, the compulsory competitive tendering programme, once restricted to
blue-collar services such as refuse collection, is being expanded to
white-collar work. Legal services must go out to tender in June next year,
with construction-related services (architecture and quantity surveying), to
follow in July.
Information technology must follow in December, followed by finance,
personnel and corporate administration in 1995. Some councils, such as
Berkshire and Westminster, have put some of these services out to tender
voluntarily.
Contracting out white-collar services allows easier adaptation to the more
fragmented services which councils must now provide to allow for more
devolved services, such as education. In some cases, it can allow for a
better job to be done than the council could do itself.
Some authorities have even voluntarily contracted out white collar services.
For example, Oxfordshire has entrusted a third of its finance department,
dealing with pensions and pay-roll administration, to the CSL group. The
council said that with the fragmentation of its other services, this offered
the best route to allowing central services to be run cost-effectively. It
was also able to negotiate a contract which ensured that all its existing
staff maintained their jobs - which was not always possible for councils who
compulsorily put blue-collar work out to tender.
The private sector is also making progress on the second front of blue
collar contracts, and appears to be winning a greater share of the market
with each new round of contracts.
According to a report by the Institute of Public Finance, a research arm of
the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, private companies
have won more than two-thirds of the refuse collection contracts put out to
tender by councils since January last year.
Private contractors now operate contracts worth almost Pounds 150m a year in
total - 24 per cent of the market. That shift should continue, according to
the IPF.
However, the pattern is uneven across sectors. Private sector bidders have
enjoyed most success in building cleaning, ground maintenance and refuse
collection, according to the Local Government Management Board.
The LGMB's latests survey of ground maintenance contracts, covering England,
Scotland and Wales, finds that direct labour organisations have held on to
67.5 per cent by number (853 of 1263 contracts), and 82.5 per cent by value.
For building cleaning, direct labour organisations had held on to only 436
of the 904 contracts surveyed by the LGMB (81.5 per cent by value).
But penetration of more complex and tightly defined contracts, such as
school catering, has been minimal.
In catering (education and welfare) contracts, the public sector has held on
to 97.6 per cent, by value, of the contracts to be tendered.
In these areas, with few opportunities for staff cuts, and a rigidly defined
job specification, there is little or no profit to be made. According to Mr
John Sutcliffe, of the LGMB, 'the sectors which have attracted the most
interest and labour-intensive. If you can cut your labour costs, have other
people doing the job with a reasonably flexible specification, the private
sector can do that quite effectively.'
This suggests that white-collar CCT may not be as effective in providing
attractive opportunities for contractors.
But there is still controversy between researchers on whether the exercise
has succeeded in its prime aim of saving public money.
The most optimistic assessment of the CCT programme so far comes from Dr
Stefan Szymanski of the London Business School, who has analysed the
difference between prices paid now for refuse management contracts and the
costs attributed to these services recorded by local authorities before
contracting out in returns to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy.
According to Dr Szymanski, direct unit costs for refuse collection have
fallen by an average of 27 per cent since competitive tendering started.
This does not take into account the cost of monitoring the contract (which,
he suggests, is around three or four per cent), and so Dr Szymanski believes
the true level of saving has been between 20 and 25 per cent.
This research showed wide disparities between authorities, with 10 per cent
some enduring real terms increases, while 20 per cent of authorities cut
costs by more than 40 per cent.
It also found a marked economy of scale, with high cost authorities tending
to be about 20 per cent smaller than the average, and low cost authorities
around 5 per cent smaller.
But both the Audit Commission, which acts as a watchdog for local
government, and Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government
Studies, have produced much lower estimates for savings, at between 6.5 and
seven per cent. Their surveys differ by including a smaller number of local
authorities, but cover the full range of contracted-out services.
These estimates include the cost of managing the contracts, and compare
directly between the years immediately before and immediately after
contracting out. Therefore they aim to avoid the problems of accounting for
cost saving via technological improvements, which may lie behind some of the
savings identified by the London Business School.
Whatever savings have been achieved seem to have been maintained, judging by
the first refuse management contracts to be renegotiated. Out of the first
nine councils to do so, all bar one achieved real terms reductions in price
compared to 1988 of at least 18.4 per cent.
This contradicted prevailing wisdom that private sector bidders had treated
the first year as a 'loss leader' and would extract greater profits later.
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CDC Research, which published
the information, said the increase could be attributed to private firms
deciding to bid aggressively for volume. He also pointed out that the power
to re-tender had greatly strengthened councils' hand.
In return for a long contract and an agreement not to re-tender, councils
were able to extract significant cost-cuts from contractors, he said. This
is underlined by Dr Szymanski's research, which shows that longer contracts
tend to be for lower prices.
What is unmistakeable is the growing strength of the private sector.
According to the Institute of Public Finance, the research arm of the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, 'with each new
tranche of contracts that passes, private contractors appear to be winning a
greater share of the contracts.'
The challenge of the next year is to repeat these gains on the subtler, less
labour-intensive white-collar services which will soon be up for tender.

World's largest 'outsourcing' contract for computer services
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PICTURED above is the data centre of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) at
San Diego, California, which recently won a Dollars 27m 'outsourcing'
contract with Sun Microsystems. CSC is one of the largest independent
services companies in the computer industry and has developed many long-term
outsourcing partnerships in the last twenty years to provide information
technology (IT) services in the US, including NASA, New York State and the
National Flood Insurance Program. The addition of the world's largest-ever
outsourcing contract (Pounds 3bn over then years) at General Dynamics has
taken CSC's outsourcing business to around Pounds 1bn - 40 per cent of the
company's total earnings.
This year, the Services Management Division (SMD) of CSC Europe, based at
Weybridge, Surrey, secured the outsourcing contract for British Home Stores
(BhS). For BhS, this contract involves business re-engineering, extending IT
links into the supply chain, developing inventory management and marketing
new retail systems.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (3): Well
pleased with progress - Profile: Sir Peter Levene, Efficiency Adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PUTTING almost Pounds 1.5bn of work out to tender in a single year is an
ambitious target in any large organisation. For the civil service, this
60-fold increase in its market-testing programme has required a step-change
in the way it approaches the delivery of government services.
Overseeing the change is Sir Peter Levene, the investment banker who acts as
the prime minister's efficiency adviser. Sir Peter, 51, is deputy chairman
of Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking concern, and chairman of
the Docklands Light Railway.
He declares himself well pleased with progress in this first round of the
current programme, which is due to be completed at the end of September.
'We got off to a slow start because of all the argy-bargy over the
employment rights of civil servants whose jobs were contracted-out. And the
process was foreign to many departments which had to learn how to do it. But
people have now 'got the bit between their teeth' and are making progress.
'I really have no idea how much of the work is being contracted-out, since
the tests are still going on. There is no doubt, however, that some very
substantial contracts are being placed.'
Sir Peter has also been pleased at the interest shown by the private sector
in bidding for civil service work. A conference organised in January to
attract private sector interest was so over-subscribed that it had to be
repeated to accommodate the 1,200 business executives who wished to attend.
However, there were a lot of misconceptions at the outset, according to Sir
Peter. He is anxious to counteract the view that the market-testing
programme is an attempt to contract-out large parts of civil service work.
'The programme asks whether work done by government departments could be
done better by an outside body and whether the present team doing the work
could come up with better ways of doing it.
'Armed with that information, you can then decide how to go forward -
whether the work stays in house unchanged, or stays in house on a rather
different basis, or an outside body does the work.
'The object of the exercise is to find the best way of doing the work. If it
ends up being contracted out, that is one solution, but it's not the only
one.'
That may not be what many in the private sector want to hear. There is a
feeling among some contractors that the way in which contracts have been
parcelled up and the inside track enjoyed by the in-house team have loaded
the dice too heavily against them.
Sir Peter is unapologetic, however - 'when you launch a programme like this,
departments which have little experience in it will make mistakes or have
different approaches,' he says.
If contractors believe that they could come up with a better solution under
a different set of rules, they are free to do so, he adds.
'They shouldn't be afraid to put in a non-conforming bid.
'To be on the safe side, they should also put in a conforming bid and say
that if the specification can be relaxed or changed in the following ways,
they could bid in this more innovative way.'
And if bidders have complaints about how the programme is being implemented,
they should raise them with the department concerned - 'complain to the
person running the programme, if necessary to the permanent secretary, if
necessary to the minister,' he says.
'If you don't get any answer from them, tell us and we'll see what we can
do. We can only learn by what people tell us.'
'Us' in this case is the six-strong Cabinet Office efficiency unit which
co-ordinates the market-testing programme and advises departments on how to
implement it.
'We deliberately have a small team at the centre because we don't want to
run a huge centralised exercise removed from the people who actually
understand the work. It's important that market-testing should be done by
each department which understands the work - they must be masters of their
own destiny.'
Although he is based in the private sector, Sir Peter is no stranger to the
ways of Whitehall. He was first brought in by Mr Michael Heseltine who, as
defence secretary, appointed him as personal adviser in 1984.
In 1985, he became Chief of Defence Procurement on a special contract said
to be worth Pounds 100,000 a year which drew political fire from Labour MPs
and disquiet among career civil servants. However, the effectiveness of the
new procurement regime he put in place was increasingly recognised by the
time he completed his contract in April 1991.
As in the Defence department, Sir Peter has found that encouraging a more
entrepreneurial approach has encouraged lateral thinking among civil
servants - 'people are now saying that if they are 'given their head,' they
can show us how to do the job better,' he says.
'The objective is to run the government's business in the most efficient way
possible.
'Market-testing puts everything under the microscope and makes departments
look very carefully at what they are doing. I think people are now beginning
to understand that that is what it's about.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (2): Big
boost for bought-in services - The progress of the UK government's  market
testing programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's market-testing programme, launched last November, has
provided a massive boost to Britain's market for bought-in services.
In the first year of the programme alone, almost Pounds 1.5bn of services
has been put out to tender, involving work currently done by 44,000 civil
servants.
Even larger amounts are expected to follow over the next three years, with
as much as half the civil service annual running costs of Pounds 20bn likely
to have been exposed to market-testing by the time of the next election.
Progress on the first year's programme has been slow, with a sizeable part
unlikely to be completed by the end of September as originally planned.
While it is too soon to predict the final outcome, it appears that around
half the work on tenders already completed has gone to the private sector,
with the in-house team winning the remainder.
No data is yet available about the likely savings which will come from the
first round of market-testing. When Mr William Waldegrave, the public
services minister launched the programme last year, he said that savings of
up to 25 per cent might be possible.
The experience of compulsory competitive tendering in local government
suggests that this may be an ambitious target.
Research by the Department of the Environment shows average savings of 6.5
per cent, while the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog,
estimated a reduction in costs of 7 per cent from contracting-out.
However, Mr Waldegrave emphasises that cutting costs is not the only
objective: market-testing should contribute to improving the quality of
public services.
Writing the specification for work that is to be put out to tender forces
managers to define the outputs they wish to achieve from the activity. Even
if the contract goes to the in-house team, they will in future be working to
agreed standards, with penalties if they do not achieve their targets.
And on the principle that the people already doing the job may be best
placed to know how to do it better, departments have provided advice and
resources to help the in-house teams in drawing up their bids.
Giving the in-house team the opportunity to bid has not been universally
popular among private sector bidders. There is widely-held fear that the
contracts are structured to favour the in-house team. There are also
suspicions that managers in charge of the market-testing programme in
departments may be biased towards their colleagues' bids.
Accusations of 'tilted playing fields' are equally common among in-house
teams, however. They fear that the ministers who will make the final
decisions have a bias towards private sector bidders. They also accuse
contractors of sweeping away the good employment practices of the civil
service to cut costs.
Only the final results of the first round will show whether the
market-testing progress has been fair, according to one civil servant
involved in driving the programme forward - 'providing both private sector
bidders and the in-house teams have won a reasonable share of contracts,
then neither side will be able to cry foul.'
The work being put out to tender covers a wide range of functions, including
the traditional support services such as cleaning, catering, security and
reprographics. But the programme has also invited contractors to bid for
more mainstream activities, such as information technology services, audit
and accountancy, legal services, payroll, typing and secretarial services.
And some government functions which might be described as core civil service
work have been included in the programme, including the collection of
official statistics, naval surveillance operations for Customs &amp; Excise and
ship radio licensing.
The first round has not been entirely free of hitches. Perhaps the most
embarrassing was the series of escapes of prisoners in the care of Group 4,
which won the contract for prison escort services in the East Midlands,
Humberside and Yorkshire.
The company said that many of the escapes were attributable to the faults of
others. But the 'leakage' proved highly damaging to the credibility of the
market-testing programme.
The Prison Service Agency and the Home Secretary staunchly resisted calls to
terminate the contract and the contracting-out of prison escort services.
And after three months of the contract, Group 4 now says that it has lost
less than half the number of prisoners who escaped from the police or prison
service during the same period last year. However, their much-publicised
problems may have slowed up further progress on contracting out such
high-profile work.
Another embarrassing hitch came when Inland Revenue mailings to employers at
the start of this tax year, handled for the first time by private
contractors, went awry with information on individual taxpayers sent to the
wrong addresses.
This situation rekindled doubts among MPs over whether the standards of the
private sector in handling confidential information matched those of the
civil service.
The first months of the programme were also dogged by uncertainty over the
employment rights of public sector employees whose work was contracted out
to the private sector.
There was disagreement - even among the government's legal advisers - over
whether the Acquired Rights Directive applied to market-testing. If it did,
successful bidders would have to take over the existing staff and their
civil service terms and conditions.
The uncertainty led to some departments suspending their market-testing
activities, while others had to retender for contracts when it became clear
that the directive applied to them.
It was several months before the law officers issued a definitive ruling
that the directive could apply to market-testing, requiring each contract to
be examined to see whether it applied to it.
But despite these setbacks, the programme is now forging ahead. Already
departments are drawing up lists of activities to be market-tested next year
and planning for the two following years. Pressure to expand their
programmes is being applied to departments which have under-achieved this
year in comparison with other departments.
Ministers remain committed to the market-testing process, as a stimulus to
improving value for money in the civil service. With a Pounds 50bn deficit
in the government's finances, there is little choice but to use every weapon
in the armoury to promote efficiency in central government services.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (1):
Contractors cash in on battle to keep down costs - Organisations in the
public and private sectors are increasingly buying-in specialist services -
or 'outsourcing' - allowing them to cut costs and concentrate on their core
business activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor

<TEXT>
BUYING-IN services as a better way of managing resources is a management
idea whose time has come.
It comes in many forms: outsourcing, contracting-out, facilities management,
market-testing, compulsory competitive tendering, interim management.
But whatever the label, it is steadily spreading throughout business and
industry, and into the public sector. And a host of new and established
companies see interesting opportunities for growth in selling services to
private and public sector organisations.
In its various guises, the underlying idea behind buying-in services is the
same. Organisations should concentrate on their core activities and buy in
other services they need from specialists. Good resource management means
that they should 'stick to their knitting,' as the business schools would
put it.
In one sense, there is nothing new in the idea. Since the dawn of
capitalism, business has functioned through the division of labour.
Factories buy raw materials from mining companies, components from
specialist manufacturers, and distribute their products using transport
contractors.
Initially this division of labour was between different steps in the chain
of production. But increasingly, there has been a division of labour within
each step in the chain.
A car-maker, for example, will contract out support services necessary for
the smooth running of the factory such as catering, cleaning and security.
Making sandwiches and employing part-time cleaners require different skills
to car-making, and specialist companies have sprung up to supply them.
What is new is that this process has recently gone much further, as
companies increasingly buy in services which are close to the core of their
business. It is no longer low value-added services which are contracted out:
highly skilled functions central to business success are now increasingly
supplied by specialist contractors.
For example, information technology has become increasingly the preserve of
the specialist, with many non-IT companies finding it is no longer sensible
to try and provide all their needs in-house. They may find it more
convenient to have their IT function staffed by an outside facilities
management contractor. Or they can go for outsourcing, buying in all their
IT needs from a company which can offer leading edge technology and flexible
capacity.
Now outsourcing is going beyond IT, reaching right into the heart of
businesses by providing personnel, training, accountancy, office services -
even frontline staff for service organisations. Facilities management can
involve contracting out the running of an entire plant or office facility to
a specialist who may in turn sub-contract much of the work. Interim
management can supply top managers to fill temporary vacancies or drive
through special projects
A good example of the extent to which core business functions can be
contracted out is provided by IBM's UK national call management centre at
Havant. The centre's 100 operators handle 27,000 calls a week from IBM
customers requesting computer maintenance. Providing a responsive,
high-quality service is central to the company's image.
Yet the centre is staffed almost entirely by personnel supplied by Manpower,
the recruitment specialists. Manpower recruits the staff, trains them and
remains their employer. Indeed, Manpower managers fill five of the nine
places on the centre's management committee.
According to Mr Mike Coleman, the centre's manager, the arrangement gives
him flexibility and keeps costs to a minimum. And although the key frontline
staff are not his employees, the partnership with Manpower allows him to
offer the quality of service he regards as essential if the centre is to win
new call-handling business.
Now well-entrenched in the private sector, buying-in services is spreading
throughout the UK public sector.
Once again, the process started in support services, with compulsory
competitive tendering in the health service, local government and the civil
service. During the 1980s, cleaning, laundry, catering, security, buildings
maintenance, waste removal, reprographics and many other mainly blue-collar
functions were contracted out.
In some cases, contracts have been won by the existing staff, bidding as an
in-house team. However, the in-house teams have had to form themselves into
direct labour organisations, re-organised to become competitive in the
market-place. In local government, they are set targets for rates of return
on capital, so that they do not take undue advantage of their control of the
existing assets.
Thus, even when the in-house team wins, the pressures of competitive
tendering make them perform as independent contractors, with the same
incentives to cut costs and raise efficiency.
From buying-in support services, contracting-out in the public sector is
moving into white-collar areas of work, just as it did in business:
In local government, compulsory competitive tendering is to be extended to
white-collar services such as IT, housing management and corporate services
from 1995. Many local authorities have already begun outsourcing some of
these functions because they see it as a better way of providing non-core
services.
In central government, the market-testing programme will this year put 8 per
cent of civil work out to tender, with similar amounts in each of the next
three years. Core administrative tasks are being market-tested, reaching
deep into the heart of Whitehall.
Throughout the public sec-tor, the newly independent colleges, schools and
hospitals are increasingly outsourcing and contracting-out to cut costs and
improve effectiveness.
Some of the biggest contracts in the public sector will be in information
technology, with up to Pounds 750m of work potentially available in civil
service departments alone. The market for bought-in IT services is now
mature, with revenues of Pounds 4bn last year earned by the 200-plus members
of the Computing Services Association.
Other markets are equally substantial: contracted catering services are now
worth over Pounds 800m a year, for example. The local government and health
service market is estimated to be worth more than Pounds 2bn a year, while
this year's civil service market-testing programme is worth Pounds 1.4bn.
The value of local authority housing management contracts, due to go out to
tender from 1996, is put at Pounds 1.25bn.
The growth in buying-in of services has generated new business opportunities
across a wide swathe of service industries. Traditional contractors now face
competition from companies established to bid for public sector contracts.
But it also requires new ways of working, for both the organisations which
buy in services and the businesses which supply them. The key to outsourcing
functions that are central to the success of the organisation is a close
relationship between the customer and the contractor, according to Mr John
Staples of EDS-Scicon, the largest services company in the world.
He says that a common mistake is to treat buying in of services in the same
way as purchasing hardware - looking for the cheapest price. 'It's more
important to leverage in the right skills,' he says.
Among customers, the benefits of buying-in services appear to be well
appreciated. A survey of the UK market for facilities management by Computer
Management Group found that FM had brought cost-savings and strategic
advances for the majority of businesses in the survey.
Three-quarters said that FM allowed management to concentrate on core
business. Cost-savings were reported by 56 per cent of the companies, with
only 15 per cent reporting cost increases.
The main problem for the contractors appears to be assuaging the fears of
companies which have not yet bought in services. Over 50 per cent of the
non-FM users in the CMG survey, for example, worried that facilities
management would lead to a loss of control over their organisations. Only 14
per cent of users said that this was a concern.
However, the number of non-users appears to be rapidly shrinking: 35 per
cent of the companies in the CMG survey were using FM, up from 25 per cent
the year before.
With 70 per cent forecasting an increase in facilities management in IT, the
market for buying-in services looks set to both widen and deepen
significantly over the next few years.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Management: Sculptors in jelly - The misunderstandings and
challenges surrounding process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Organisations are rather like giant jellies, says Richard Heygate, a partner
at McKinsey &amp; Co, the consultancy. If you resculpt too limited a part of
them, they wobble back into their old form. But if you try to remould too
much at once, the whole effort becomes unmanageable and they collapse into a
quivering heap. The jelly may even become rock-solid and resistant to
further reshaping.
Heygate's simile is imperfect: jellies seldom wobble back into place when
tampered with. They usually emit rude noises, and topple sideways. But it
does give a taste of why many companies are finding it so hard to succeed at
the 're-engineering' of business processes - or what he calls 'core process
redesign'. It also helps explain why a widespread chorus of rude and cynical
noises is already bursting forth in the US and Europe about the fashion for
re-engineering.
James Champy, co-father with Michael Hammer of the re-engineering concept*
and chairman of CSG Index, a McKinsey rival, puts the problem in more
down-to-earth terms. Many re-engineering exercises fall flat, he says,
because an organisation's senior managers 'do not really have an appetite
for discontinuous (radical) change, and all the pain that goes with it'.
Many do not appreciate the degree of change required - not just in business
processes, but in managerial behaviour and organisation structure.
These are some of the reasons why Champy says that only 5 or 10 per cent of
the companies which say they are 'doing re-engineering' actually are - even
though he says the rest will have to follow suit over the next five years
'or else they'll be out of business'.
'The term re-engineering is misapplied widely - almost to any sort of change
programme', Champy complains. People even mistake it for 'downsizing' -
laying people off. At best, says Heygate, 'what all but a few companies are
doing is really just total quality management - fixing certain processes
from the bottom up. So it's not surprising that well-publicised gains in
individual processes are failing to be translated into dramatic improvements
in the performance of the whole organisation'.
CSC Index and McKinsey probably have more experience in process redesign on
both sides of the Atlantic than any other global consultancy, except
possibly Gemini. Some of the Boston Consulting Group's extensive work on
'time-based competition' is also re-engineering under another name.
CSC Index and McKinsey may be arch-rivals, but they concur reasonably
closely on the main points where companies are tending to go wrong with
re-engineering (or 'core process redesign').
Champy's checklist of re-engineering 'do's' and 'dont's' is dauntingly long.
In addition to those already mentioned, he says failures occur when top
management neglects to redefine clearly what he calls the organisation's
future 'operating model', the extent to which its competitive edge needs to
come from superior customer service, manufacturing efficiency, or innovative
products and services - or a mixture of all three.
McKinsey consultants call this a company's 'value proposition': a statement
of the distinctive value it proposes to deliver to customers. From this
should flow an analysis of which business processes are 'core' to its
competitiveness, and which therefore need the most urgent attention. 'Too
often re-engineering addresses non-critical elements of the business',
agrees David Hall of Boston Consulting Group.
Management may also harbour inadequate ambitions for the organisation's
performance in its core processes, continues Champy. For re-engineering to
have a chance of working, he says, a series of specific targets must be set
for increases in market share, quality and service standards, and for
reduced costs and capital. These targets must be enumerated and articulated
in a way which challenges the organisation effectively.
Champy sees other snares - failure to grasp the need for the organisation's
management style to change entirely, from command and control to
empowerment; and the tendency to get waylaid into 'mapping' all the
organisation's existing processes before re-engineering any of them.
The mapping snare may seem relatively trivial, but it 'creates a lot of
useless work that delays you from getting on with what needs to be done  -
sometimes for years', says Champy. He blames the failure of a big IBM
re-engineering exercise several years ago partly on this tendency. Process
mapping is 'an invention of the consulting profession to keep a lot of
junior consultants busy', he says.
Champy's advice is augmented by John Hagel, a colleague of Heygate's at
McKinsey, who has produced one of the most useful checklists of tips about
'keeping core process re-design on track'**. He lists a string of 'red
flags' which provide early signs that something is going wrong. They
include:
Inadequate management attention. For a redesign to be successful, the chief
executive and several other senior managers must devote up to half their
time to it, for its entire duration;
Inadequate urgency and stamina. Between a third and half of the total
performance improvement should be deliverable in the first six to 12 months
of implementation; such 'early wins' are key to sustaining the effort's
momentum. But the rest may take two or three years to achieve.
Inadequate focus. When a company says 'we've defined 40 or more core
processes' (as Xerox did at one stage), this is a strong warning signal.
Most businesses can be broken into three to five core processes (Xerox now
lists only seven); any further subdivision means big cross-functional
performance improvements may be missed.
By the standards of conventional 'change management' programmes, Hagel's
target of completion within three years looks over-optimistic for anything
more than the redesign of a single core process; most companies have found
from bitter experience that it takes far longer than that to accomplish
successfully a broad programme of radical change.
The challenge of re-engineering is 'to learn how to do big change fast',
says Champy. Disarmingly, he admits that consultants have almost as much to
learn as clients.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Management: Pizza to stay - with extra tenacity - A bankrupt
company is every manager's nightmare. How one man survived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Stateside Foods ever becomes grand enough to merit a coat of arms, Roy
Goodall has his Latin motto ready - nunc etiam adsumus, meaning 'we are
still here.'
The English version has been his standard phrase to customers inquiring
after Stateside's corporate health during the past 18 months. It lost Pounds
1.65m during 1990 and 1991, scraped through to break even last year, but is
forecasting Pounds 526,000 profits for 1993 on projected sales of Pounds
5.5m.
The company makes chilled pizzas for half a dozen supermarket chains at its
factory in Haslingden, Lancashire. Checks on its health followed lay-offs, a
withdrawal of overdraft facilities by its bank and a whispering campaign by
some competitors in the UK pizza makers' war for supermarket shelf space.
In the jargon of corporate finance, the company is a bimbo - a
buy-in-management-buyout. In September 1991, Goodall bought into a
management-buyout gone wrong. It needed his expertise as a former
big-company general manager and, before that, a marketing man.
The company had been bought by its management two years before, but
inadequate controls had seen rapid sales growth offset by deepening trading
losses.
Goodall's career had plateaued with middle age. He and his wife decided to
do something on their own and opted for Stateside.
But, as Goodall told a CBI-Grant Thornton north-west regional conference
last month, a nightmare was about to begin. After three months, he upgraded
the quality of its advisers from the 'man and a dog' level his predecessors
had been content with and discovered that the balance sheet had a Pounds
500,000 hole in it.
Over-optimism had led to mis-statements of creditors, debtors, stocks and
assets which the previous auditors had ticked, rather than challenged.
The accounts had looked satisfactory at the time of the buy-in, but it
needed some hands-on experience of Goodall's type to make the realistic
assumptions that would pierce the facade.
As the reality sank in, he realised he was in up to his neck in a bankrupt
company. In the days between Christmas and New Year, he told his bank. The
business was originally founded in the Midlands and the bank was 170 miles
away. He and the manager hardly knew each other. Facilities were immediately
withdrawn. 'I certainly don't blame them,' he says. 'I would have done the
same.'
An interview followed with an insolvency practitioner which made Goodall
feel much better. He was told he was legally obliged to act in the best
interests of Stateside's creditors. Here was a dilemma. Closed down,
Stateside's assets would not fetch enough to pay everyone off, but the
company was by then trading in profit on a day-to-day basis and he believed
its sales forecast was healthy and realistic, with a firm contractual base.
The creditors' best chance of getting their money was for Stateside to carry
on trading - without incurring more debt, as this would have been illegal.
The main creditors took the point and converted what they were owed into
medium-term loans, bolstering the balance sheet and taking pressure off cash
flow.
Sales were factored, so that 80 per cent of revenue was immediately
guaranteed each week and supplies could be bought on a pay-as-you-go basis.
'If you want to see just-in-time practised as an art form, we are it,'
Goodall says.
The payroll had already been slimmed from 80 to 34. He told everyone what
was going on, asked for commitment and co-operation - and Stateside gingerly
started trading its way out of the nightmare.
Confidence grew with sales, and Stateside made an important capital purchase
 -a second-hand burglar alarm, bought for cash, after a spate of pizza
robberies. Next came a Tannoy and music system to bolster morale on the
production line.
By this time last year, suppliers and - encouragingly - would-be suppliers
resumed talking about credit. Sales grew and Stateside achieved a Pounds
200,000 trading profit last year, although this was reduced to break-even,
pre-tax, by finance charges. The company now looks like surviving. Two
prospective buyers have already been turned down. Sales, production and
profits are rising weekly.
Goodall is confident enough to talk about his experience and pass on what he
hopes are the lessons. The 60 company owners and their advisers at the
conference - on why some companies break through to big growth while others
do not - listened spellbound.
Tenacity, commitment and realism were some of his messages. Others concerned
simplicity of vision, hard work, consistent quality of product and making
the best use of people. 'The majority of venture capitalists and bankers
only look at the balance sheet and past performance,' he said.
'The emphasis is on the past, which usually undervalues the business and
most certainly undervalues the people. Surely, sustainable profits and
earnings per share are what really count.'
He stressed the need for good professional advice, even though this might
cost more. Cheap audits cannot be worthwhile if they merely comply with
legal requirements and do not reveal the company is heading towards
bankruptcy.
Advisers should add value, offering constructive criticism to ensure
accounts reflect reality.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Top judge backs right to jury trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD TAYLOR, the Lord Chief Justice, said yesterday he was opposed to
abolition of the defendant's right to choose trial by jury.
Removing the defendant's right to elect for jury trial in cases which can be
tried either by magistrates or at the Crown Court was the most controversial
of 352 recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice
earlier this month.
Giving his first public response to the commission's report at a conference
in London, Lord Taylor said it was essential not only for justice to be done
but for those concerned to have confidence in the process.
'We must have regard to our history, our culture and the perception of many
that trial by jury is a fundamental right,' he said.
If limits were to be placed on the right it would be better to increase the
categories of less serious cases which should automatically by tried by
magistrates. This might involve removing the right for low-value thefts, for
example. But this was 'surely preferable to the socially divisive regime
which may well result from the commission's more sweeping proposal'.
The Lord Chief Justice said he welcomed the commission's report in general.

   CHRISTCHURCH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday said victory at
the Christchurch by-election was within his party's grasp but 'not in the
bag by a long chalk'.
Mr Ashdown, paying his last visit to the constituency before tomorrow's
vote, said: 'People are rushing around taking it as self-evident. I think
victory is within our grasp but it is not there. If people stay at home or
vote Labour they are in effect telling the government it's OK to continue as
they have done so far.'
Mr Ashdown made a stinging attack on Mr John Major's leadership style when
he addressed a packed meeting.
Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the biggest
Tory gun fielded yesterday, limited himself to accusations that the Liberal
Democrats suffered from electioneering 'amnesia'.
All parties in the campaign insist that irrespective of the political
melodramas unfolding in Whitehall, it is the familiar litany of 'real-life'
issues - value added tax, law and order and the economy - that are
dominating the campaign questions in its final days.
With memories of the general election still fresh in many canvassers mind,
the mood among most local Conservative workers yesterday remained
self-consciously upbeat. 'I am determined. We are all working very hard,'
said Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, although he refused to make
predictions about the vote.
Yet as workers from the national party wandered around the quiet cul de
sacs, some confessed to misgivings. 'This is a by-election and I think that
people won't pay as much attention. I am sure we will win it back at the
next election,' said Mr Jack Aspinwall, MP for Wansdyke.
The Liberal Democrats admitted that their biggest fear remained the 'silent
Tories'.
One party official said: 'The problem we have had all the way along since
the general election is that a lot of people won't say they are Tory voters.
There are a lot of people who you have to assume are Tory voters.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Law lords rule Baker guilty of
contempt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A landmark constitutional ruling the House of Lords yesterday decided
that ministers of the Crown were not immune from proceedings for contempt of
court.
Five law lords ruled that Mr Kenneth Baker, former home secretary, was
guilty of contempt in his official capacity - although not personally - over
the deportation of an asylum-seeker in 1991 in defiance of a court order.
The law lords rejected the Home Office's contention that there was no power
to enforce the law by injunction or contempt proceedings against a minister
of the Crown in his official capacity.
Lord Templeman said that, if the Home Office's argument were upheld, it
would 'establish the proposition that the executive obeys the law as a
matter of grace and not as a matter of necessity, a proposition which would
reverse the result of the Civil War'.
He said he was satisfied that Mr Baker was acting throughout in his official
capacity on advice which he was entitled to accept and under a mistaken view
about the law.
The finding of contempt was the first against a minister of the Crown.
It was made for not complying with an injunction to block the deportation of
an asylum seeker from Zaire.
The man, a 28-year-old teacher, had fled to Britain claiming he had been
imprisoned and beaten for opposing the regime of President Mobutu.
Mr Baker ordered his deportation on the grounds that he had failed to
satisfy the Home Office that he had a 'well-founded fear of persecution' if
returned to Zaire.
Before his lawyers could bring a renewed application for judicial review, he
was flown to Paris.
There, in spite of a request to a senior immigration officer for him to be
returned to the UK, he was put on a connecting flight to Kinshasa.
The finding of contempt against Mr Baker in his capacity as home secretary
will not result in any punishment but the Home Office was ordered to pay the
costs of the case.
The Home Office said last night that Mr Baker had acted throughout in good
faith and on legal advice in his capacity as home secretary.
The department added: 'As he has made clear, he had no intention of putting
himself above the law. The constitutional issues raised by the case are of
great importance and we are considering their implications.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rees-Mogg's legal premise 'false'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Rees-Mogg was yesterday accused of attempting to 'frustrate'
parliamentary legislation aimed at incorporating provisions of the
Maastricht treaty into UK law.
On the second day of the legal action by the former editor of The Times to
block ratification of the treaty, Mr Sydney Kentridge QC, for Mr Douglas
Hurd, foreign secretary, said he did not dispute Lord Rees-Mogg's legal
standing in bringing the case as 'a concerned citizen', but he was under a
profound misconception of the constitutional role of the Crown and
parliament.
Notwithstanding UK membership of the European Community, the Crown retained
its prerogative powers to make and ratify treaties, which had no legal
force, while parliament retained its powers to decide what changes, if any,
were to be made in UK law as a consequence of a treaty being signed.
Mr Kentridge said under the British constitution the Crown, by virtue of the
royal prerogative, represented the UK in foreign affairs and that the making
and ratification of treaties and other international agreements was a power
of the Crown within that prerogative.
It was an important corollary of this that in the UK treaties did not have
the force of law. If performance by the UK of treaty obligations would
entail an alteration of existing domestic law, then an act of parliament was
required to make the necessary alteration.
If parliament was unwilling to make changes in UK law to fulfil its treaty
obligations, then the UK might be in breach of its international
obligations; but the treaty would not have altered the law of the UK, Mr
Kentridge said.
Lord Rees-Mogg argued that EC treaties were different, because the 1972
European Communities Act had implicitly removed from the Crown the
prerogative power to enter into and ratify treaties which amend existing
Community treaties.
But both the reasoning and the premises of Lord Rees-Mogg's argument were
false, Mr Kentridge said.
First there was nothing in the 1972 act which impaired the prerogative of
the Crown in its treaty-making power.
Second, whereas an amendment to an existing Community treaty might alter
Community law as between member states and might place the UK under an
international obligation to alter the law of the UK, it did not of itself
alter the UK law, he said.
Mr Kentridge said it was not for the courts to intervene in matters of
purely international agreement involving the Crown.
There was no way that ratification of the Maastricht treaty conferred on the
European Council a right to conduct the UK's foreign affairs, he said.
The case continues today.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories see image boost in PM's
strong words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR TORY party figures insisted yesterday that the publication of full
transcripts of private conversations in which Mr John Major swore and made
derogatory remarks about colleagues would enhance his standing rather than
damage it.
There had been fears that Mr Major's remarks were so much at odds with the
Conservatives' public calls for unity following the split within the party
over Maastricht, that they would add to the impression of Tory disarray.
But party officials said that telephone calls to Tory offices had been
positive, as people welcomed Mr Major's readiness 'to face down rebels in
his own party'.
Sir Giles Shaw, a member of the executive of the influential 1922 Committee
of Tory MPs, told BBC Radio: 'After one hell of a week, the prime minister
has shown robust and pretty steely views and one must applaud him for that.'
The toughness was also apparent in the withdrawal of the Tory party whip
from Mr Rupert Allason, the MP for Torbay and the only Conservative not to
support the government in last Friday's confidence vote.
The particularly important role given to his local constituency association
in determining his future career was spelt out in the letter to Mr Allason
from Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, which was published
yesterday.
It said: 'I have decided to suspend the whip from you until Nicholas Baker
(Mr Allason's regional Commons whip) and your association chairman recommend
your reinstatement after you have demonstrated clear and consistent support
for the government.'
Last night Torbay Conservative Association said after a meeting that Mr
Allason would explain his actions to its executive council in September.
There is no prospect of his rehabilitation before then.
While the political excitement over Mr Major's comments showed signs of
dying down, a fresh row was developing over related newspaper telephone
lines.
The Daily Mirror and The Sun advertised telephone numbers to enable people
to hear the tapes of conversations they had published - the Daily Mirror the
off-the-record conversation on Friday in which the prime minister spoke
bitterly of the difficulties of managing with a small majority, and The Sun
the private comments by Mr Major just before last year's election.
The lines were yesterday banned by the telephone information services
watchdog as 'an unreasonable invasion of privacy'. The companies running
them were given 24 hours to justify the services.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour row on Ulster erupts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENT within the Labour party about whether to organise in Northern
Ireland erupted into acrimony yesterday. The party's frontbench team
published a pamphlet accusing those who supported organisation of tactics
'not dissimilar' to those of the Militant Tendency.
The argument came as the Tories - who began organising in Northern Ireland
in 1989 - demonstrated the difficulties the mainland parties can experience
there. Dr Laurence Kennedy, a Conservative councillor, resigned from North
Down Borough Council after attacking his party's policy towards Northern
Ireland.
Dr Kennedy said Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland secretary, seemed to want to 'connive in the
perpetuation of the religiously divisive politics which have cost Northern
Ireland so dearly'.
Both events come within days of the understanding reached last week between
the Ulster Unionists and the government, which led the nine Ulster Unionist
MPs to support Mr Major in the Commons vote on the social chapter.
Labour's pamphlet, 'Oranges or lemons?', argued that organising in the
province would undermine the party's policy of actively seeking the unity of
Ireland through consent. It said that Northern Ireland was different to the
rest of the UK because of competing national allegiances.
The paper, published by Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland
secretary, called Labour-supporting electoral integrationists 'dishonest',
and accused them of 'entryism' because they really wanted Labour to become a
unionist party.
Labour MPs who want the party to organise expressed disappointment that Mr
McNamara 'should allow such a mischievous and scurrilous document to be
published'.

Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURPRISE, surprise. Mr John Major is a human being. Publication of the prime
minister's off-the-cuff conversation with a television journalist has
provoked the inevitable synthetic horror from some in the press.
My goodness, Mr Major occasionally uses four-letter words. (Journalists
never, ever swear). He is fed up with some of his cabinet colleagues. He is
scathing about the has-beens and never-has-beens on the Tory back benches.
He knows that he is referred to as a wimp.
Those who take the trouble to study his conversation with Mr Michael Brunson
of ITN will see the sort of exchange which occurs every day at Westminster
between journalists and senior politicians.
Mr Major swears a great deal less than one or two in his cabinet. He is
kinder about his colleagues than some of them are about him. He is far too
sensitive about what journalists say and write, but he can occasionally make
fun of himself.
As anyone who has spoken to him for more than a minute or so knows, he is
more impressive in private conversations than when he is placed in front of
a camera or on a podium.
He makes no secret of his bitterness towards those who have used the
conflict over Maastricht to undermine his political authority. He feels
hemmed in by the combination of a small majority and the burning resentment
of the Thatcherite dispossessed.
The label 'bastards' was pinned on these embittered souls rather than on
anyone in particular in the cabinet.
His unguarded comments do reveal some of his weaknesses - his reluctance,
for example, to sack errant ministers. The remarks have also raised eyebrows
among those of his colleagues who have been admonished for speaking too
freely to the press.
By and large, however, the episode confirms the view of those insiders who
have been saying for some time that, as the Maastricht battle has drawn to a
close, Mr Major's confidence has begun to return. He is said to be sharper
in cabinet committee meetings, less tolerant of the meandering debate which
clogs up the Whitehall machine.
He is trying to be himself again. Sir Gordon Reece, the man who built Lady
Thatcher's prime ministerial image, no longer pays his weekly Sunday evening
visit. Mr Major has even been seen pulling out his election soapbox to
address informal gatherings at Number 10.
It would be nice to say then, that with Maastricht over and the public
offered a glimpse of the prime minister's more assertive inner self, his
abysmal standing in the country might begin to recover.
Sadly a few more unpleasant realities are about to intrude.
Unless the electors of Christchurch have been engaged in a gigantic and
inexplicable confidence trick, Friday morning may see the Conservative party
waking up to the biggest by-election defeat in post-war history.
Ministers insist it has been well-discounted. The summer recess means fewer
of the awkward squad on the Tory backbenches will be around to snipe at the
prime minister from radio and television studios.
But the anticipated defeat will reverberate through the already disgruntled,
and in some cases openly rebellious local party associations.
The October conference, with revolts looming over the imposition of value
added tax on domestic fuel, on law and order, on Europe, and on much else
threatens to be what one (indiscreet) senior minister terms 'a wretched
affair'.
If that fear is realised the buck will stop with a prime minister whose
reputation for niceness was replaced some time ago with one for weakness.
The party faithful, as much as the country at large, want that indefinable
quality called leadership. So do the Tory MPs upon whose nerve - or lack of
it - Mr Major's future will depend during the winter.
They also want a sense of direction. The prime minister has failed to
articulate a coherent programme for his government. After 14 years in office
the promise of a crackdown on crime and a burst of deregulation is not
enough.
The anti-Europeans alone cannot topple him. The danger is that the
uncommitted centre of the Tory party at Westminster is losing faith in his
leadership.
There are ideas around in Downing Street for a new prospectus. Sustaining an
investment-led economic recovery, rebuilding industrial competitiveness and
a linked drive to revitalise education and training policies are among the
themes.
But the prime minister has yet to put a thread through the beads. An
unpopular November Budget will limit his room for manoeuvre. Legislation to
allow higher British con-tributions to Brussels will give the Euro-sceptics
the opportunity to launch another assault.
The odds are that his unscripted outburst last week will do him no harm
among the voters. It might even do him some good. But either way, Mr Major
has much more important things to worry about.

FT  28 JUL 93 / S&amp;P queries Lloyd's credit rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the leading US credit rating agency, has questioned the
quality of the financial security of the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Mr John Gardner, managing director of S&amp;P's insurance ratings service, said:
'There is too much uncertainty regarding Lloyd's to apply a specific rating,
but the insurance market does not appear to offer the highest level of
security.'
He added: 'All we are saying is it is not triple-A any more. There is no
danger whatsoever of Lloyd's ceasing to to trade.' Mr Gardner's evaluation
is based on public information. S&amp;P has not assigned Lloyd's a rating on its
ability to pay claims as it did not have access to unpublished data.
Lloyd's losses amount to more than Pounds 6bn in the last five years, while
its capital base has fallen from Pounds 11.1bn to Pounds 8.7bn since 1990.
It recently reported its worst-ever annual loss of Pounds 2.9bn for 1990.
S&amp;P began analysing Lloyd's in 1991 and started a syndicate-evaluation
service last year, monitoring the performance and financial strength of the
more than 200 insurance syndicates which trade at the market. Several
syndicates which received the lowest S&amp;P rating of one star have
subsequently ceased to trade.
Mr Gardner said that developments at Lloyd's over the last two years had
been worse than S&amp;P had anticipated.
He added: 'I don't think we had the slightest perception about how bad the
losses were.
Many people involved as underwriters and brokers have long regarded Lloyd's
security as a non-issue, believing it to be immune from the kind of
financial duress that can lead ultimately to policyholder claims not being
met.'
Mr Gardner said that in recent years 'rose-tinted' assumptions about Lloyd's
future security had become 'untenable'.
'Lloyd's may provide good security, but as they say in the Scottish courts,
the case is not proven.'

FT  28 JUL 93 / Fishermen warn they may become an endangered species: Rules
to conserve stocks are being challenged in the courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STIFF breeze is blowing across Newhaven harbour, East Sussex, and most of
the port's trawlers are lying idle. Strong winds in the English Channel have
put paid to another morning's fishing. It's a scene which helps to explain
why fishermen are locked in bitter conflict with the government over the
future of their industry.
This autumn the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations will ask
the High Court, through a judicial review, to block the introduction of new
rules designed to conserve fish stocks. The rules, implementing an European
Community-wide agreement, mean that boats over 10 metres long will be
limited next year to the same number of days they spent at sea in 1991.
The federation says a typical trawler spends about 180 days at sea and warn
that this could be cut to 158 days under the new rules, reducing a crew
member's pay of up to Pounds 15,000 by as much as Pounds 3,000.
The fishermen say the unpredictability of the British weather adds to the
injustice of being forced to tie up their boats for part of the year. 'A
great deal of the UK fleet is controlled by the weather,' said Mr David
Scott, federation president and chairman of the Newhaven fishermen's
co-operative. The best fishing months in Newhaven are September to December,
but if trawler crews save their quota of days until then, only to be stymied
by the gales of the last couple of years, they would have to risk dangerous
seas or be left with unused days and less fish.
Mr Scott said: 'This question of tie-ups is the most immoral act that's ever
been put upon one nation's fishermen.'
The rules were designed to help reduce the UK's fishing capacity by 19 per
cent by the end of 1996 in order to preserve dwindling supplies of fish. EC
officials say cod is particularly hard hit, with North Sea breeding stocks
at a record low of about 90,000 tonnes against what scientists warn is a
sustainable level of 150,000 tonnes.
Fishermen say they have no quibble with the principle of conservation. But
this particular legislation has spurred them to blockade ports and organise
lobbies of parliament.
If the rules take effect, they will be forced to flout them to save their
businesses, said Mr Scott. 'No way will they ever conform to being tied up.
There will be head-on confrontation,' he added.
Their main complaint is that other EC fishermen do not face such
restrictions. 'We'll have UK vessels tied up and what they don't catch will
be caught by the other member states, so it really won't do anything for
conservation,' said Mr Scott. He was referring particularly to French and
Belgian fishermen in the Channel. But EC officials point out that Dutch
crews, the main catchers of sole and plaice in the southern North Sea, have
for some time faced limits on the days they can spend at sea.
The federation, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales, Northern
Ireland and the Channel Islands, also argues that costs such as insurance,
harbour dues and boat maintenance will still have to be paid even though
income may drop. Fishermen are already feeling squeezed by the 15 per cent
to 30 per cent fall in the price of fish at the start of the year, when
cheap imports from Russia, Iceland, Poland and Norway flooded the EC market.
In tandem with its legal fight, the federation is drawing up an alternative
conservation package to put to ministers in September. It includes larger
mesh sizes for nets, bigger landing sizes and escape panels in trawlers -
all designed to prevent juvenile fish from being caught before they can
breed.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, minister for agriculture, fisheries and food, called
for common international action this month, warning that without it, 'there
will be no fish for anyone to fish, no jobs for any fishermen and no
security for any fishermen's families'.
But conservationists are partly on the fishermen's side over the tie-up
rules. Ms Mary Munson, fisheries campaigner at Greenpeace, said policing the
seas is at the heart of the problem. UK fishermen have been incensed at the
sight of trawlers from other EC countries fishing illegally in British
waters. However rigorous the UK's 142 port inspectors are, said Ms Munson,
'it's the nature of fishing that you can't get an inspector to go on every
boat'.
She added that better monitoring of landings and inspection of boats at port
by all EC states is essential, along with measures such as the European
Commission's proposal to track boats by satellite.
UK fishermen, suspicious of their European competitors, claim two hidden
agendas: that the EC wants to reduce UK capacity to make way for the large
Spanish and Portuguese fleets, and that Britain is intent on forcing its
fishermen out of the industry without having to compensate them.
Ministry officials agree the choice of the controversial 'tie-up' system was
partly based on cost, although it is also seen as more enforceable than the
conservation measures favoured by fishermen. The main alternative to
restricting fishing days - a large-scale programme to pay fishermen to stop
fishing - would be more than the Treasury would accept in the present
financial climate.
The government has already announced a three-year Pounds 25m programme,
which it hopes will reduce the fleet by about 5 per cent. The UK has 11,000
vessels, of which 3,500 are over 10 metres. The fishermen and their
supporters in parliament want a programme worth at least Pounds 50m.
Introduction of the tie-up rules has been postponed from October to next
January to allow for wider consultation. If the federation wins its High
Court action, the government may be forced back to the drawing board. Other
member states, facing the same pressure to cut their fleets, will watch the
outcome with interest.
