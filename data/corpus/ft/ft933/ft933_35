FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bosnia view not logical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRYN JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mate Boban (Personal View, July 22) justifies the ethnic partition of
Bosnia by comparing it to the confederation of the 13 colonies into the
United States. The inadequacy of this analogy exposes the poverty of the
partitioners' case. No outside powers sought to impose a constitution, and
the US was established on the basis of the separation of religious identity
from governmental powers.
If Owen-Stoltenberg, UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and President Bill
Clinton go along with the Boban logic they will be tearing up a 200-year-old
tradition of civic rights and returning Europe to those wars of religion by
which semi-feudal regimes enforced religious homogeneity. Some Bosnians may
have voted on 'ethnic' lines. None was given the chance to choose democratic
and negotiated reforms rather than military partition. If the United Nations
could organise democratic choice in Cambodia, why not - even now - in
Bosnia?

FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: South Africa's missing structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Patti Waldmeir's contention that 'western-style democracy will find it
hard to resolve' South Africa's conflicts (July 22) needs qualifying.
Western democracy began with local government, from which democratic
national government evolved. Local conflicts described by Ms Waldmeir need
the appropriate local structures for accountability and conflict resolution.
What South Africa must avoid is the 'African-style democracy' that plunged
Angola back into civil war: an imposed national poll, within a virtually
non-existent constitutional framework, with an overwhelming popular
perception of winner-take-all. The South African negotiators' setting of a
national poll date, preceding any clear decision on what South Africans will
actually be voting for, can only set alarm bells ringing.

needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN SINCLAIR-WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I welcome the emphasis you put on people's well-being in your
editorial, 'Clarifying the green agenda' (July 21), there are many things in
it to quarrel with. Let me take just two points.
I am not sure that it makes sense to speak of a 'purest' form of the concept
of sustainability. It is a complicated idea, made more so by being used to
sharpen quite different political axes. But perhaps the simplest analogy is
with the agricultural idea of husbandry, of managing one's resources and
risks to ensure a continuing livelihood through thin as well as thick.
Central to it is the need to balance short-term and better-known
consequences against long-term, less certain ones, the argument being that
the scale of some of the longer-term dangers more than outweighs the
uncertainty of their occurrence. (A secular version of Pascal's Wagner,
which works.) The policies it advocates involve trade-offs which depend on
the state of knowledge at the time, and as that evolves so do the policies
have to change. Nothing new in that, but it expressly does not consist, as
your leader would have it, of a simple dictum such as 'conservation for its
own sake' (though there are cases where that may be right, too).
Ring-fencing the prettier parts of nature can be a direct way of undermining
livelihoods and with them the well-being which should be sustained.
I was also breath-taken by the complacency with which you view the damage to
the ozone layer, as though with a Protocol and a bit, we can all rest easy
on the beach. There is a clear correlation between UV exposure and skin
cancer and I would have thought that ozone thinning presented one of the
clearest examples of the risks to health which you started out by saying
were the best reason for acting in environmental questions. OK, some action
has been taken, but if CFC production were to stop today (and it won't), the
ozone layer will still get thinner before it gets thicker, perhaps much
thinner. And, quite apart from the suffering and the medical bills, there is
the imponderable threat the radiation poses to the bottom of the food chain
in the southern ocean. There might also, one would have thought, be some
salutary lessons to be drawn from the fact that such an apparently inert and
benign gas could, in the course of half a century, wreak such damage. Those
long-term consequences again.
I don't dispute that sound environmental policy requires priorities, but
perhaps the first is to get the subject straight(er).

FT  26 JUL 93 / Personal View: Blueprint for better policing in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir PATRICK SHEEHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I never thought that I would come to miss the Takeover Panel, critical
though I have sometimes been of it when we have crossed swords in the past.
However, I rather wish the Police Federation was subject to the demand for
accuracy the panel imposes. The federation's response to our report has been
so long on emotion and so short on factual content that the shareholders
(the public at large) must be confused.
The report is the culmination of an inquiry into police responsibilities and
rewards set up 12 months ago by the home secretary. The committee's other
members included John Bullock, Professor Eric Caines, Professor Colin
Campbell and Sir Paul Fox, each being appointed on the basis of their
experience in managing large organisations both inside and outside the
public sector.
We fully recognised that our lack of professional experience of working with
the police service made it vital that we should learn about the police at
first hand, so we made 55 visits to 24 forces. We found that police
constables felt badly managed and chief officers lacked the tools to manage
them.
What changes are we actually recommending to taxpayers' investment in the
police? Our objectives were: to retain the best policing based on consent;
to increase the number of officers doing real policing; to give chief
officers the flexibility to manage; to enhance the empowerment of all ranks
but require greater local accountability; and to recommend a radically
different pay and rewards system to bring these objectives about.
The two elements of the recommended pay and rewards system that have aroused
the most criticism are the introduction of performance-related pay and the
move to fixed-term appointments.
It has been claimed that fixed-term appointments are inconsistent with the
concept of the police service as a vocation and that they would make it
impossible for an officer to have a 'job for life'. This is a curious
argument. Anyone who really has a vocation can still make the police service
a 'job for life' and, moreover, the service will reward their expertise and
dedication, better than it does at present.
Fixed-term appointments provide an opportunity for officers to review their
careers, to consider their options both inside and outside the service and
to leave with dignity and a fair compensation package, if that is the best
course.
In other professions, individuals of the highest calibre are not put off by
the absence of a guaranteed 'job for life'. On the contrary, their
motivation to provide the best service possible is directly related to the
importance placed on the quality of its delivery.
The only grounds for refusing to renew a fixed-term appointment are
specified in our report: they are medical unfitness, gross misconduct,
manifest incompetence or severance on structural grounds. Not even the most
partisan police officer could disagree with the first three. And dismissal
on 'structural grounds', though it may sound like a sinister catch-all
provision for the aged and the unwanted, in fact has a highly specific
meaning: it will occur only when there is either nothing for an officer to
do, or when there is nothing which he or she is capable of doing.
In reality, it is likely that very few police officers will have their
career prospects abruptly terminated by the non-renewal of a fixed-term
appointment.
Performance-related pay is an equally contentious area and has been labelled
as just about everything from divisive to impractical. The chorus of
disapproval has tended to obscure the inquiry's recommendation that
performance itself should only be one element in the matrix. Between them
there are 12 points to be allocated in order to determine an officer's
position on the basic pay scale. Only three points relate to performance,
amounting to no more than 10-15 per cent of the basic pay an officer could
receive.
The service has already acknowledged that it could work with the other
elements of the matrix - role scope; circumstances and experience and
skills. Is it the case that the service is saying that it cannot cope with a
system that incorporates this modest, but important, element to recognise
individual performance? Officers in management positions already make
complicated judgments about the relative skills of people under their
command, and all officers are posted, and progress through the service, on
the basis of just such judgments.
The inquiry seeks to formalise this process, reward an officer's performance
through pay and, via the appraisal system, ensure that officers are treated
fairly and can comment on judgments that are made.
To say this process, and the payments to be made, will destroy team spirit
and cohesiveness of the service must be an exaggeration. At present,
officers stand side by side in public order incidents but their pay differs
because of their length of service, regardless of unsatisfactory,
satisfactory or outstanding performance.
The inquiry has never claimed that acceptance of its recommendations would
lead to a reduction in crime but it has certainly suggested that a better
led, better managed and more accountable police service could win greater
public confidence. This, in turn, should lead to better co-operation from
the public, which is the essential element in the fight against crime and
which, sadly, is an ingredient which has been diminishing year by year.

government-appointed Committee on Police Roles and Responsibilities.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: Flapper's Art Deco fantasia restored - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took five months in 1929 to build the present Savoy Theatre. It was the
brain child of Rupert D'Oyly Carte and the theatre opened with a revival of
Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers. The building of the theatre was
something of a miracle. The architect was one Frank Tugwell but the real
genius behind the fantasy world of the interior was Basil Ionides. He was a
design guru - today he is remembered much more for his books on decoration
than for any of his completed schemes.
A glance at any of his volumes published by Country Life reveals a world of
certainties of taste and judgment that today seems very alien. As he wrote
at the time: 'It is a curious form of vanity that makes people want to have
what other people appreciate rather than what they like themselves.' At the
Savoy Theatre, which was revealed in its restored form last week, Ionides
had no doubts. He felt that a new theatre in London opening at the end of
the flapper era should reflect the brittle American world of Art Deco -
glittering and shimmering with a sharp exoticism.
When the theatre was destroyed by fire in 1990 the opportunity was seized to
restore it exactly as it had been in 1929. English Heritage - an
organisation more criticised than blessed, took the right decision when it
demanded that the theatre should have the Ionides decorative scheme restored
in every possible detail. While no one could claim that the interior that
flashed before the audiences at the ballet last week is in every way
technically perfect, it is something of a restorer's tour de force.
There are three aspects to the restoration that should be critically
considered: the quality of the interior decoration, the efficiency of the
installation of modern technology, and the overall architectural effect. The
architects for the restoration are Sir William Whitfield and Partners, the
technics are by Theatre Projects Consultants and the engineers are Max
Fordham and Partners. It is not an easy task to combine the virtues of a
Grade I listed interior with the demands of modern theatrical machinery,
lighting and comfort. At the new Savoy I felt all this had been achieved
very effectively bearing in mind the tightness of the site and the wish of
the Savoy group to add on a fitness suite to the hotel as part of the
rebuilding. The success lies in the architect's reticence. Whitfield
Partners have in a way taken a back seat to Basil Ionides, making many of
the current improvements practically invisible.
Surprisingly, no drawings existed of the 1929 decorative scheme, although
there were contemporary photographs and written descriptions. Whitfield
Partners are fortunate in having Red Mason on their staff because he is the
most dogged and effective architectural researcher in the business. His work
at Christ Church, Spitalfields, has been exemplary and at the Savoy Theatre
he was not daunted by the lack of evidence. The building accounts make it
clear that aluminium leaf was used for the gilding, and the dazzling gold
and multi-colour effects were produced by the use of coloured varnishes. The
vivid and luxurious carpets were reproduced from tiny scraps that survived
the fire. Paint scraping is a fine art today and the extent of the detective
work is hard to imagine. A great deal of time was spent in the Victoria and
Albert Museum where the sources of much of the decorative motifs were found.
An antique Chinese screen in the museum seems to have been the root of many
of the Chinoiserie panels around the proscenium.
The effect of the steeply raked auditorium is dazzling and many may find it
vulgar. Art Deco is an acquired taste. Ionides looked to China, Egypt,
Mexico for his sources and then mixed them up with a fashionable angularity
that today seems entirely of the 1920s. The drop safety curtain comes as
something of a shock, striped as it is in scarlet and orange. It is rumoured
that when the theatre opened, members of the audience were encouraged to
telephone ahead and select their seat by colour - it was crucial that the
flappers' dresses should not clash with the decor.
Today our colour sensitivities seem less developed. It is hard to take
Ionides seriously when he writes in detail about colour in his book, Colour
and Interior Decoration, because we have been so conditioned by architects
of the modern movement to think that everything should be white or grey. The
joy of the Savoy is that it does bring back colour to interior design in a
provocative, sensual and slightly shocking way. It is right for a theatre
and right for that mood of excitement before the curtain rises. What the Art
Deco moment did achieve, particularly in its more triumphant manifestations
in New York, was a sense of stylistic climax, a flash of joy that is rare
indeed in architecture and perhaps belongs most of all in the theatre.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: A vintage year at Drottningholm - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELISABETH Soderstrom's long and glorious career in opera began in 1947, on
the stage of the Drottningholm Court Theatre (she sang Mozart's Bastienne).
The latest development of that career seems, therefore, peculiarly apt and
symmetrically satisfying: she has taken over artistic direction of the
annual summer festival at the Stockholm royal palace.
This year's programme represents her first go. Four main events are dotted
across the three-and-a-half month schedule (May 20 - September 4): a Haydn
opera and a Figaro ballet provided by Stockholm Royal Opera forces and, in
home-grown productions, a Gretry comedie-ballet and an Italian comic opera
by the Spaniard Vicente Martn y Soler. Nicholas McGegan, a British
'period'-conscious opera conductor of ever-increasing international renown,
takes over as music director; John Cox, a favoured Soderstrom collaborator
from her Glyndebourne days, is one of this year's producers.
To judge from the two shows that I saw, Gretry's Zemire et Azor (1771) and
Martn's Una cosa rara (1786), the Soderstrom era at Drottningholm has been
launched in high style. A visitor's pleasure in this most perfectly
preserved and artistically inspiring of the world's 18th century theatres is
likely to be bounteous even when the fare is only moderately interesting or
modest in execution levels. Since this year both shows were operas of high
interest - operas hugely successful in their day that are eminently worth
the re-discovery in ours - and both performances were full of vitality,
one's cup was in danger of running over.
Arnold Ostman, the previous Drottningholm artistic and musical director,
pursued over his 12 years in office a survey of the peaks of 18th century
opera - in other words, Mozart and Gluck. Soderstrom, wanting to examine the
territory around those peaks, has with Gretry and Martn launched a programme
which she subtitles 'Perspectives on Mozart'. Una cosa rara, an obvious
candidate for any such enterprise, was composed on a text by Da Ponte and
given in Vienna six months after Figaro, with many of the first Figaro
singers in its cast.
It is full of Mozartian-sounding music; indeed, most opera people know of
the opera, if at all, through Mozart's witty 'in-joke' quotation from
Martn's Act 1 finale in the supper scene of Don Giovanni. But there is far
more to Una cosa rara - as a British colleague said at interval, as we
stumbled out on to the Drottningholm lawns high on all the zest, buoyancy
and inventiveness on offer, 'Where has this opera been all our lives?'
Da Ponte's libretto, with a heroine who remains true to her shepherd beloved
in spite of various attempts on her virtue from higher up the social scale,
is a brilliantly plotted eight-hander up to the halfway mark which loses
pace and impetus thereafter. This, and the sense one gains that Martn's
melodies, structural elaborations and character developments lack sustained
depth for all their captivating charm and telling detail, may be responsible
for the opera's relative neglect. (In fact, modern revivals are not unknown
 -a 1968 London fringe staging featured the young Josephine Barstow and Alan
Opie - and a recording from Barcelona has reached CD format.)
Nevertheless, in the light of McGegan's marvellously enjoyable account of
Una cosa rara - keyed-up, brightly coloured, theatrically zestful at every
moment - even relative neglect seems incomprehensible. There is a Spanish
accent to many of the tunes, a Spanish patina to much of the scoring, (Martn
started life as a Madrid zarzuela composer); it is this that underlines the
distinctness of the opera's musical and dramatic character, and brings to a
halt the inevitable game of contrast-and-compare with Mozart.
Francisco Negrin's production, though based (as everything always is) on the
Drottningholm stock of 'authentic' scenic components, was modern in an
irritatingly unstylish way - too much farce, double-take and general
knockabout, too much extraneously imposed dance movement. This was the only
blot on the evening (and, in truth, only a minor one). In the opera's two
leading roles, the faithful Lilla and the Queen (who offers wise counsel in
difficult situations), the young Swedish soprano Elisabeth Berg and the more
internationally experienced Swedish soprano Lena Nordin produced exactly the
poised, unpushed tones required for the theatre. Among the men there was a
tendency to loudness-for-its-own-sake, but no real weakness.
Zemire et Azor, a Beecham favourite, most affecting of all Beauty and the
Beast operas, is another apt perspective on Mozart (who is said to have
treasured his Gretry vocal score, and remembered Ali, the opera's
servant-figure, when creating Papageno). It is also a beam of light on
penetration of Gluckian ideals into French opera of all types in the latter
part of the 18th century, promoting and sustaining as it does a line of
simplicity - melodies catchy and characterful at first hearing, scoring
light yet full of concealed subtleties - whose underlying strengths a
Drottningholm production is admirably placed to flatter.
John Cox, at his best working in small theatres on intimate, elegantly
fashioned subjects, was an admirable Gretry producer, Louis Langree a
sensitive, careful Gretry conductor. The cast, while short on outstanding
voices, was balanced, musical, uniformly attractive. The opera was given in
the Swedish translation first used in the era of Gustaf III himself, and -
as with the Martn - vaut le voyage.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: Choral Proms at the Albert Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's Promenade season has the look of a holding operation in
anticipation of the 100th season in 1994. Budget constraints and a shortage
of visiting orchestras from overseas (no doubt for the same reason) have
left the director, John Drummond, calling on every ounce of his ingenuity.
Early music must have seemed an irresistible answer to his problems. The
performing groups are small, presumably cost-effective; the audience
response is likely to be good. I was surprised last year to find one early
music programme, not especially popularist and taking place on a Monday
evening which is always difficult to sell, attracting a full house with
queues for returns straggling around the Royal Albert Hall.
So, for the BBC Proms 93 there is a proud parade of leading international
early music groups. The Cologne Chamber Choir, formed in 1970, has been
raising its profile through recordings of late. On Wednesday last week it
came to London for a performance of Bach's B Minor Mass under its conductor
and founder, Peter Neumann. Heard live, the choir did not disappoint: a
youthful, well-balanced sound, clear and nimble, when asked to show its
paces.
Even in the grandest Bach choral works, pace is essential these days.
Neumann is an interpreter in the 'authentic' style. For all its
accomplishments, the performance was not very individual and is best
described in terms of what it was not - not as soul-searching as Parrott,
not as outgoing and public as Gardiner. The lightly-dancing Bach of Gustav
Leonhardt is probably Neumann's nearest equivalent.
In the last resort the Albert Hall seemed too grand for a performance on
this scale (swallowing up the delicate wind solos in the opening 'Kyrie',
for example, so that the strings' wisps of counter-melody strangely took the
spotlight). The Collegium Cartusianum was the orchestra. The five able
soloists were Christine Schafer, Ursula Eittinger, Annette Markert,
Christoph Pregardien and Gotthold Schwarz.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: The Hamlet Project - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiona Shaw has taken a group of young actors from the Abbey Theatre and made
them into a fine company of Shakespeareans. The Hamlet Project grew from her
workshop sessions at the Abbey last summer into a full-scale production of
the play which opened at the Galway Arts Festival and will tour Ireland for
the next month.
It is an exciting Hamlet, demanding of both actors and audience. It runs for
two and a half hours without interval in one corner of a vast, leaky
munitions warehouse. Similarly large, uncomfortable and unorthodox venues
have been carefully selected for the tour. Use of props is minimal, costume
is present day casual, and there is no set as such. The 10 actors rely on
voice, movement and energy - and Fiona Shaw's often inspired direction - to
put new life into the familiar words.
The opening ghost scene is lit only by candles in jam jars and, after a long
mood-setting silence, is played in terrified whispers. Entrances and exits
are made through the audience, usually at running pace. As the play
progresses the empty spaces of the other three-quarters of the warehouse are
brought into use: Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' soliloquy is sprung suddenly
upon the backs of the audience; Ophelia's final scene is delivered from the
top of a distant railway carriage-sized shipping container.
The very absence of normal theatrical trappings becomes a virtue, leading to
ever more ingenious improvisations. For example, the midnight chimes which
herald the second appearance of the ghost are banged out on a cast iron
pillar; a circle of rope spread on the floor becomes the players' stage.
There is an authentic Elizabethan feel to such low-tech makeshift measures.
Hamlet's apparent madness is signalled simply but strongly by his appearance
in court naked, his body bruised and scratched: he wraps his arms in black
plastic sticky tape while delivering his lines.
Instead of drilling Irish voices into standard Shakespearean English, the
policy seems to be to let each actor work with the accent that he or she is
most at home with. It took some time to tune the ears to unexpected Irish
cadences, but once in tune the diversity seemed to enhance and refreshen the
verse.
Jane Brennan, an unusually youthful Gertrude improves as the evening goes
on, finally achieving remarkable depth of feeling. Ophelia, a small,
child-like woman played by Anna Livia Ryan, raised the hair on the back of
the head with her loud songs of madness, and went on to maximum pathos in
the 'herb strewing scene' clad in white bra and pants with a bucket of water
as her only prop. John Lynch as Hamlet looks the right age - 30 - and grew
in moral stature so effectively that Horatio's words at his death - 'now
cracks a noble heart' made perfect sense. Sean McGinley's Claudius - who,
like the whole cast, looked as if he had been sleeping rough for the last
few months - is a guilt-ridden nervous wreck from the very start. Something
rotten in the state of Denmark indeed.
But this Hamlet is so much a company achievement that it seems wrong to
single out individual performances. This is no star vehicle but is the
result of 10 dedicated actors working together to bring a reputedly
difficult play alive for audiences who will include many coming across
Shakespeare for the first time. This is an aggressive, hyperactive
production which provides an unforgettable experience of theatre in the raw.

will disappear within 30 years if current road building plans go ahead. At
9.30 Panorama devotes itself to the compelling topic of rape. A little later
(11.40) the same channel, BBC1, begins an entire series on sexual harassment
at work. Be honest now, you have been saying to yourself for months, 'What
we really need is five half-hour programmes about sexual harassment'. What
in the world can they do for an encore? 'Teach Yourself Trepanning' perhaps.
If you are going to avoid all those and all the repeats your choices become
pretty limited. In BBC Proms (7.30 BBC2) you can hear Stravinsky's
'Petrushka', four songs by Grieg, and Tchaikovsky's Suite No 3. Then at 9.00
in Travellers' Tales (C4) the excellent travel writer Norman Lewis explores
South East Asia, progressing from jungle tribes in Papua New Guinea to a
place in Indonesia where an entire mountain has been removed in the search
for copper.

society
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 13m design and build contract for a new headquarters for Birmingham
Midshires Building Society has been won by MOWLEM MIDLANDS of Wolverhampton
part of John Mowlem Construction.
The Society's new headquarters and computer centre, on an eight acre site at
Pendeford Business Park on the northern outskirts of Wolverhampton, is one
of the largest investments to be made the West Midlands for some time.
The project comprises a high quality, 15,000 sq metres four- storey,
steel-framed building with piled foundations, facing brickwork and a
slate-tiled roof.
There is an extensive services package, designed to make every element of
the installation environmentally friendly. The scheme also includes a
creche, car parking and extensive landscaping which will be enhanced by the
planting of several thousand trees and shrubs. Work has started and
completion is scheduled for the end of 1994.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Cardiff Bay development project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Ports has awarded a Pounds 14m contract to TAYLOR WOODROW
CONSTRUCTION SOUTHERN to build a new headquarters and related infrastructure
for NCM Credit Insurance at Cardiff Bay.
Grosvenor Square Properties Group, the property development subsidiary of
Associated British Ports Holdings, won the 119,000 sq ft pre-let for the
building against stiff competition last August, following NCM's decision to
relocate from Cardiff city centre.
The project has been designed by Cardiff-based Holder Mathias Alcock and
London architects Nicholas Hare for client Associated British Ports. It is
located at Capital Waterside, the former Roath Basin which is to become
Cardiff Bay's leading commercial property centre.
The NCM building is to be situated on a prime position overlooking the inner
harbour at the junction of Harbour Drive and Britannia Quay, and is designed
to reflect the maritime setting. A key design feature is the air
conditioning system, which is based on the displacement ventilation
principle. Completion is scheduled for the end of next year.

The latest move in the on-going shuffle of City economists is that of Mark
Brown from UBS Securities. Brown, 30, has been appointed head of strategy
and economics at Hoare Govett where he will be responsible for the
macro-economic research department covering the UK and Europe.
Brown (above) started his working life as an economist at the Confederation
of British Industry, before moving on to the Treasury in 1984. There, under
the eye of Rachel Lomax, now deputy secretary in charge of financial
institutions, he helped develop a method for working out the number of
individual shareholders in the wake of the privatisations of the early
1980s.
An occasional rock-climber, but now more devoted to his 18-month old son
than to outdoor pursuits, Brown worked at UBS for seven years. He takes up
his post at Hoare Govett sometime towards the end of the year.
In another move, Mark Brett, director of bond and currency strategy at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has announced that he is leaving in September to
join investment advisory firm, Capital International.

The Pounds 5.4m scheme covers the construction of a hall of residence
(pictured above) for Oxford University's Merton College.
The contract will provide 93 study bedrooms in three blocks together with
eight, one and two-bedroom flats, a porter's lodge and glass conservatory.
Building at Merton, amid the historical architecture of central Oxford, will
require Wimpey to use materials carefully selected to blend with the
existing colleges and buildings in the surrounding area.
The three-storey buildings will be enveloped with hand-made brick and a bath
stone cladding and topped with Cumbrian slate pitched roofs.
The 66-week contract will be complete by September next year ready for the

FT  26 JUL 93 / People: Dawes 'earns his spurs' and comes on board at
English Trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
English Trust has made Simon Dawes, a corporate financier from JS Gadd, its
eighth director now that he has 'earned his spurs', according to fellow
director Anthony Wieler.
He joins up with Stephen Goschalk and Charles Good, both former senior Gadd
executives. The two moved to English Trust, Good on a non-executive basis,
when the boutique merchant bank acquired the corporate finance activities of
Gadd last December.
Dawes, however, was not taken on immediately, but worked on a number of
projects for English Trust. 'We wanted everyone to prove their worth,'
Wieler explains. 'People sometimes don't bring as much business with them as
they say they will.' In May, Dawes had worked on a private placement for a
nursing home, Exceler, which raised Pounds 2m.
English Trust reckons the pick-up in corporate finance activity in recent
months signifies an end to recession for smaller companies. Dawes is
understood to be working on two larger deals currently, including one
cross-border venture.
Previously, Dawes, 49, had spent 20 years at Laing &amp; Cruickshank
specialising in engineering and then smaller companies, from the analytical
and institutional broking angle.
His initial foray into corporate finance was when he joined ANZ Merchant
Bank in 1991, but the Australians shut down the UK corporate finance
operation eight months later. At that point he moved to JS Gadd.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (10): Link with M4 may
revive fortunes - The docks: the city is still a working port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLANNED transformation of 2,700 acres of Cardiff is the second biggest
regeneration project of its kind in Britain after London Docklands.
Yet, while both are creating new housing, office, leisure and industrial
opportunities in old port areas, they differ in one important respect. While
the port trades of London have moved down river to Tilbury, and further
afield to Felixstowe, Southampton and elsewhere, Cardiff remains an
important, middle-ranking, working port.
Indeed, from the windows of the spectacular new NCM building now rising
alongside the Roath Basin, office workers will get a grandstand view of the
maximum 35,000 tonnes dwt vessels which can enter the biggest of the two
remaining Cardiff docks, the Queen Alexandra; and yacht owners, coming in an
out of the impounded basin which will be created by the barrage, will have
to take care when large vessels enter and leave the sea locks into the
docks.
Guests who book into the Celtic Bay Hotel, converted out of the brick shell
of a former bonded warehouse, can dream, too, of boarding in Cardiff one of
the most romantic voyages still open to the sea traveller from Britain - a
cruise down to St. Helena, via Tenerife, Ascencion and Cape Town (with a
once-a-year extension to Tristan da Cunha), on the only remaining Royal Mail
Ship, the RMS St Helena.
Yet, despite these reminders of a great past, Cardiff's glory days as a port
have been well behind it for some time. In 1913, when exports reached a
record 13.7m tonnes (including 10.5 m. tonnes of coal), 900 ships a month
called at the port, which for brief periods exceeded both London's and
Liverpool's tonnage. In 1920, the city boasted 122 shipping companies,
owning 1.5m gross tonnes of shipping, to make it the greatest
steamship-owning centre in the world.
The switch to oil for boilers did for Cardiff, and for the Welsh coal
industry, and a long, slow period of decline has followed, taking with it
old ship-owning names like Cory, Seager, Instone, Lovering, Radcliffe,
Tatem, Turnbull, and Reardon Smith. Only two Cardiff shipowning companies
survive - Graig and CM Willie - of which only the latter, with a weekly
liner service to Bilbao, sails out of Cardiff.
As late as the 1960s, efforts were still being made by the port's owners,
the nationalised British Transport Docks Board, to attract new portside
industry to create large new trades for the port on land once occupied by 40
miles of railway track, but these failed to produce any significant results.
Since privatisation, Associated British Ports has pursued a different policy
of seeking to sell off its surplus land, and it has been this which has
opened the way for the dockland developments now taking place. Enough land
has been retained to make sure the port can continue to function, but other
land has been made available for development.
ABP's property arm, Grosvenor Developments, is responsible for two of the
main office blocks currently under way on 170 acres it has set aside for
development - for NCM and the Welsh Health Common Services Agency.
The port itself now handles around 2.5m. tonnes of traffic a year, split
between imports and exports. Coal and coke products are still exported,
though coal is now also imported, along with large quantities of oil and
petroleum products, mainly from refineries around the UK coast. Cardiff is
also an important fruit and timber importing port, though this latter trade
has been badly affected by the recession.
General cargoes, some containerised, are also handled, together with project
cargoes, such as heavy plant and machinery, with the port's hinterland from
which it can draw business extending across much of southern Britain.
Importation of orange juice, one of the fastest-growing grocery products of
recent years, is a relatively new speciality, developed as a result of
investment over recent years by ABP in improving Cardiff's quayside cold
storage. Other trades which could take advantage of the 9,000 tonne cold
store facility are also being investigated.
Just how easily port activities and the whole range of new living, working
and leisure facilities planned for the bay, including a new opera house, can
co-exist, remains to be seen, but the symbiosis that is already developing
looks as though it could benefit both. The bay developments could not have
happened if such large tracts of land, much of it originally reclaimed from
the sea for dock development, had not been available and ripe for
comprehensive development. In return for releasing land, the port is
obtaining not only new neighbours who will bring both income and life to the
area but an extensive new road network.
Originally built to be served exclusively by railway, Cardiff docks will,
with the completion of a peripheral distributor road through the bay, be on
a loop of the M4 motorway, giving instant access to the UK motorway network,
barely more than 20 miles from the second Severn river-crossing. As a
result, the port itself could become much more attractive to importers and
exporters, securing a revival in its fortunes which has eluded it for much
of the present century.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (12): Site offered to
Glamorgan - A refuse tip may become a county cricket ground
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GLAMORGAN County Cricket Club has been looking for a new ground
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and now the development corporation has made land in the bay area available
to it.
If the cricketers can find the money, a ground will be developed on a site
alongside the dual-carriageway which sweeps round the southern half of the
city. Glamorgan hopes that, with its easy access, ample space and new
stands, the proposed new ground will become not just a home for the county
but also an international ground.
Gwyn Stone, secretary to the club, says: 'We have identified a site where we
expect to build a new ground, to international standards, within the next
four years. We would like to think we could play a part as a venue for
matches during the 1998 World Cup.'
The search for a ground is part of a campaign to lift the performance and
profile of Glamorgan cricket, drawn up by the county under its new chairman,
Newport businessman Tony Morgan, working with management consultants,
Andersen Consulting.
The new ground holds the key to the county's long-term hopes of being
successful, profitable and widely-supported.
The club does not own its own ground, but uses the facilities of Cardiff
Athletic Club and other club or local authority grounds elsewhere in
Glamorgan and other parts of Wales.
The move to its own purpose-built ground would enable the county to develop
boxes and other business entertainment facilities, and to improve the
seating and catering available to all spectators, something it cannot do at
its current Cardiff ground in the city's Sophia Gardens. Though the county
would still tour, more matches would be held in Cardiff.
The new site, which is likely to cost about Pounds 10m to develop, would
also include a Welsh national cricket centre and an indoor cricket school,
where new talent could be nurtured.
Among possibilities being considered for financing the scheme are corporate
donations and the issue of debentures. Public funding might also be
available, because of the ground's location within the bay area.
Plans for the new ground, which could be in place three years from the
decision to go ahead, have been drawn up by Cardiff architects Hoggett,
Lock-Necrews, part of the international Whinney Mackay-Lewis group. Terry
Hoggett and Gwyn Stone visited Durham, which only entered the first-class
scene last year, to see its development plans.
'A ground such as the one Cardiff Bay offers us,' says Mr Stone, 'would be
part of our overall strategy to ensure the county has good facilities for
players, members and spectators. It would also be a place of national
excellence, one from which club cricketers and schoolboys could benefit.'
The 13-acre site - about the same size as Surrey's test arena at the Oval,
in south London - could be developed along the lines of Worcester's intimate
ground, Mr Stone believes, holding a full-house of about 8,000 and having a
number of smallish pavilions.
Offering the cricketers these 13 acres has one other advantage for Cardiff
Bay. The site at the moment is the cleared remains of a refuse tip.
Development for housing or industry would involve the bay's authorities in
the enormous expense of clearing the site, because of the possibility of
noxious fumes affecting people living and working there.
Ove Arup, the consultants to Cardiff Bay, have shown that an open-air
activity such as cricket would be perfectly safe and an ideal use for the
area.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (11): Fit for the 21st
century - Art for the people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE day he was appointed chairman of the development corporation, Sir
Geoffrey Inkin was determined the whole development should not just be about
bricks and mortar.
He was conscious of the effect such a massive scheme would have on the
people already living in Cardiff's docklands. He was also aware of the need
to contribute aesthetically to the environment, to produce something that
would not only work but would also look good.
The corporation would lay down the framework, by attracting the best
architects from around the world to design new roads, offices and housing in
an imaginative way.
But it was essential for him, not only that the buildings themselves should
contribute to the overall concept of the new Cardiff, but that public art
should add to the feeling that this was a city fit for the 21st century.
'Art in public places is for the enjoyment of the people,' Inkin says. 'It
helps create environments which are humane, entertaining and stimulating.
They enhance a sense of identity and the scope for art in public places is
now immense.'
To monitor the quality of the buildings, the corporation, in one of its
first moves, set up in 1988 a fine-arts panel, called rather more
prosaically the Design and Architectural Review Panel, to keep an eye on
proposed designs.
A year later, a public art consultancy team was established to research and
develop a strategy for public art and its funding.
This was followed, in 1990, by the appointment of Sally Medlyn, who was then
with North West Arts, as director of the Cardiff Bay Art Trust.
Inkin had been impressed by Per Cent for art, the scheme common in the US
and in some European countries such as the Netherlands, by which developers
put up to 1 per cent of development costs into works of art. Projects in
America showed that sculpture, in particular, was not seen as an addendum to
individual buildings but as an integral part of any development.
Ms Medlyn's trust has had an immediate impact. Three sculptors, French-born
Pierre Vivant, who has studios in Paris and Oxford, Eilis O'Connell, from
Ulster, and a Gibraltarian, Francis Gomila, working in Smethwick in
conjunction with an English architect, Ian Ritchie, were the first winners
of awards for works to be erected on key sites.
Those works were intended to stimulate interest and were funded out of
public money. They have been complemented by others undertaken under the Per
Cent scheme by Bradenham Developments, Sharpe and Fisher, and Grosvenor
Waterside.
'The initial ideal is up and running' says Ms Medlyn. 'Most importantly,
artists are being brought in at an early stage. It is too easy to get an
artist to produce a work almost as an afterthought after a development has
been created. But we are bringing the artist in, in his or her own right,
from the start.'
Such schemes are not restricted to works of art. Ms Medlyn's small team is
also concerned with improving street furniture. Lamp-posts, public seats and
serial works, which will draw visitors around a particular feature, are all
being attended to.
The most imaginative scheme was unveiled in March, when South Wales
Electricity came up with a plan to transform an ugly sub-station into a
futuristic creation. Mr Wynford Evans, chairman of the electricity company,
says the Pounds 5m scheme will transform the station, which will be the
powerhouse of the bay's electricity system, into a building fit to grace the
rest of the developments within the bay.
'We presented plans for the new sub station to artists and asked them how
they would treat a piece of modern technology in such a way that it would
produce minimum environmental intrusion,' says Evans.
'We selected John Gingell, a Welsh artist, who worked with our engineers to
produce a strong primary-coloured scheme which will include enormous
sculptures symbolising energy and power. The focal point is a 60ft light
tower, which will draw attention to the bay by night and day, and the result
of the whole redesign is immensely exciting.'
The challenge is not just to put up works of art, Ms Medlyn says, but to
create places where people can derive pleasure, whether working or visiting
Cardiff Bay.
Success still needs to be worked at, though. Wales is not a country with a
strong architectural heritage, and until NCM published the design for its
new headquarters, next to the site set aside for the opera house, there was
little evidence of distinctive architecture within the Bay. Architects
Holder Mathias Alcock attractively converted an old building for their own
use, and the two remaining Victorian buildings within the area were
sympathetically turned into flats and a hotel.
Elsewhere, there has been little evidence that the design panel has had a
great deal of success. Everyone concerned with Cardiff Bay needs to be aware
of how much remains to be done before they can be fully satisfied.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (9): New roads will
await the incomers - Transport: Rhys David sees an opportunity to re-unite
the city centre with its waterfront
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARDIFF IS a city divided by its main railway line. To the south of the
London-Swansea tracks lie the port, and the inner city suburbs, of Splott,
Tremorfa, Butetown and Grangetown, which provided the workforce for the
docks and the now demolished Guest Keen steelworks. To the north, lie the
splendid Edwardian civic centre, and the plusher suburbs of Cyncoed,
Llanishen, Rhiwbina, Whitchurch, and Llandaff.
The development of Cardiff Bay, an area one sixth the size of the whole
city, is creating an opportunity to change this orientation and to re-unite
the city centre with its waterfront, creating in the process a substantially
larger central urban area.
The objective is being achieved through investment totalling more than
Pounds 450m in infrastructure, a large proportion of which is accounted for
by a new road network. Whereas in London the pace of development in
docklands in the 1980s quickly outpaced the introduction of new
infrastructure, Cardiff has been able to take advantage of the property
market slowdown of the past four years to make sure the roads are put in
place ahead of incoming businesses.
The main piece of infrastructure is a Pounds 100m new peripheral distributor
road, one of the biggest ever urban road projects in Britain. When completed
later this decade, it will leave the M4 east of Cardiff looping through the
bay, passing underground through a central section, before rejoining the
motorway west of the city.
The road, the eastern section of which is being built by a joint venture
between local builders, DMD, and Italian group Cogefar Impresit, will make
southern Cardiff much more accessible, both from outside the city and from
its western and eastern suburbs, than has hitherto been the case, at the
same time creating a new southern perimeter to the city centre.
Other roads between the existing city centre and the bay area have also been
built, but a grand new spine route is also being planned, which will have to
carry the weight of being both the principal physical and symbolic link
between old and new city.
At present, the one-mile-long Bute Street - the heart of what used to be
known as Tiger Bay - runs south from the main east-west railway line to Pier
Head, flanked on one side by a high railway embankment carrying trains from
the Cardiff Valleys.
Under the proposals put forward by the CBDC, the railway embankment will be
removed, and replaced at road level by light railway tracks, with the main
road into the bay, a tree-lined avenue, running on either side of the
tracks.
On the bayside, the avenue will end in a waterfront piazza alongside the
proposed new opera house and the new flagship building being created for
NCM. At its northern end the avenue will deposit traffic in a new square
south of the tracks, from which it will exit into an extension of St Mary
Street, one of the city's principal retailing thoroughfares. Around the new
square there are plans to develop a total of 1m sq ft of offices, retailing,
a hotel and restaurants.
Other improvements in the road system around Cardiff may be recommended, as
a result of studies carried out by consultants into the impact of the
injection into the bay area of the city of an estimated 30,000 new jobs when
the scheme is completed. What has already been shown is that there needs to
be an increase in public transport to achieve as near as possible a 50/50
per cent split between private and public transport, and a variety of
options, including improved bus services and either an upgraded rail, or new
light rail, system, are being considered.
An extensive network of commuter services - the legacy of the former coal
train network which connected the pits with Cardiff docks - fans out from
Cardiff's Central and Queen Street stations to the valleys, with one branch
travelling along the Bute Street embankment
The CBDC has earmarked funds for a possible new light rail system which
could work on existing British Rail lines out of the city and possibly run
eventually along the city's streets. A joint study has been set up with
Nottingham Development Enterprise, which is interested in a similar
development, based on a system in use in Karlsruhe in Germany.
Uinder this system, vehicles operate on diesel or electric power and lower a
guide wheel from their chassis on to a track set in the road for use when
operating away from conventional railway lines.
The improvements planned in the transport to the area are intended to go at
least part of the way to counter the argument that investment in the bay is
depriving other parts of south Wales of badly-needed resources, by making it
much easier for people living within a 15-20 miles radius of Cardiff to
commute to work in the city, while still living in well-established valley
communities.
Improved links will also make it possible for the tourist attractions which
are planned for the area to be reached by the large population within a few
hours drive of the city, not just in south Wales but in southern England and
the Midlands.
Bristol, Avon, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire are all within an hour of
Cardiff, while areas as far away as the western fringe of London are not
much more than two hours away.
Apart from Welsh National Opera, which it is hoped will continue to attract
its own faithful clientele when its new building is developed, there will be
a range of other attractions in the bay area, which CBDC's chief executive,
Michael Boyce, believes can become a Covent Garden-by-the-sea, attracting 2m
visitors a year by 2000.
These will include, if all goes as planned, a National Science Centre,
offering a wide range of hands-on experiences, a National Centre for
Sporting Excellence, and in the areas closest to the watefront a network of
lanes, passageways and piazzas, for eating, drinking, and buying, - or just
strolling and browsing

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (7): Catching the
world's eye - Marketing: A campaign that may run for 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKETING of the Cardiff Bay development project is not simply about
letting people know that it exists. It is also about trying to form
connections with potential investors from across the world and about
informing them precisely what the development has to offer.
Michael Boyce, chief executive of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation
(CBDC), is reluctant to discuss precisely how much has been spent on
marketing the project, but the corporation's former advertising agency,
Travis Dale, says that the account was worth Pounds 500,000 in 1992.
Once parliamentary approval has been obtained, the project will shift gear
and the marketing effort will increase substantially. A gala occasion at the
Mermaid Theatre, in London, on May 18 - originally planned to co-incide with
the much-delayed securing of Parliamentary approval - is reputed to have
cost Pounds 200,000, and was designed to support the second stage message
that Cardiff Bay is now 'open for business'.
Held in the presence of Princess Diana, the event featured music from Verdi,
Bizet, and Gershwin, sung by stars from Welsh National Opera, and a new
orchestral piece, the Cardiff Bay Overture, specially commissioned from
Welsh composer Gareth Wood - set against an audio-visual backdrop of Cardiff
and the bay area.
The hard sell came in the form of speeches from Michael Boyce himself, Sir
Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the CBDC, and the then Welsh Secretary, David
Hunt; the soft sell in the form of on-screen messages from former prime
minister, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, who represented the area now covered by
the scheme in the House of Commons for more than 40 years, and Oscar-winning
Welsh actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins who trained in the city.
The Mermaid Theatre gala was not, however, just a cultural event, addressing
itself to London's political and opinion-forming classes - and, it has to be
said, to a good number of visitors from the Principality itself.
Cardiff Bay's marketing people, Edelman PR Worldwide in London and Quadrant
Public Relations in Cardiff, had made sure that representatives from 14
countries in Europe, north America and the Far East not only attended but
were given a precisely documented list of business possibilities which the
bay can offer.
Duncan Syme, Cardiff Bay's commercial and marketing director says: 'We can't
sell Cardiff Bay in isolation. We have had to try to lift the awareness of
Cardiff in the property and business world generally. The first three years
of our marketing activity have sought to generate that awareness, promoting
the big idea of the transformation of dereliction into a range of
development sites. We are now moving into more specific marketing campaigns
to get inward investment but it is a campaign which will run over 15 to 20
years.'
Peter Miller, of the consultancy, Business Development Group, which has been
responsible for the marketing strategy for the project, says that the
problem has always been how to market something that has not previously
existed.
'The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation has a much broader remit than
simple property development. In the UK the majority of development projects
are about refurbishment but Cardiff Bay is not about rescuing derelict
buildings. It is about the re-orientation of a city, bringing Cardiff into
the first division of international cities. The city, which currently faces
inward, will be turned around so that it has a waterfront.'
The initial phase of the marketing campaign has been constrained in two
ways, says Miller. 'The essential infrastructure work has had to be done
first. There has been a very lengthy period of land acquisition, and public
consultation. The other constraint has been that the scheme involved the
building of a barrage, which in turn needed a parliamentary bill. That also
has taken time. While those two constraints were with us, the marketing was
stuck in a warm-up phase. We now feel we are at a watershed, ready to move
into a new phase. We have moved from an awareness campaign to one which says
we are now open for business.'
The corporation ran an 18-month advertising campaign from 1991, and another
has just started, using a set of 'visionaries from the past' (such as
Pythagoras) to comment on the project. These ads will run in the press,
particularly business publications. 'As the campaign evolves you will see
more closely-targeted advertising, aimed at the industrial, property,
leisure and tourism markets,' says Miller.
Michael Boyce says that one of the most important aspects of the project is
its international marketing, which will attempt to make the world understand
that the project matches any other of the same kind. 'We are re-developing a
sixth of the city, and we will never know when it is finished. It will be a
continuing process, but there will be milestones along the way.'
To draw that international attention, Boyce is looking ahead over the next
three years. 'We have had a link, for almost a decade now, with the
metropolitan area of Baltimore - on the east coast of the US - which was the
inspiration and model for Cardiff Bay. The local county councils,
universities, and chambers of commerce, on both sides of the Atlantic have
built links to help each other's developments, not least by pointing
business people in each other's directions. That is much more effective, we
think, than trying to target the whole of north America, where we have no
chance at all of making an impact.'
Boyce is planning to develop the same kind of links with Sydney, Australia -
in New South Wales, named by its discoverers after the old south Wales
because of the similarity in shape fo the coastline. 'Cardiff, with the bay
development, will be part of a newer South Wales, so there is an immediate
historical and emotional link. We will be trying to persuade the
Australians, who might normally think of investing in the Pacific region, to
consider Cardiff Bay.'
Norway also has longstanding maritime links with Cardiff, evident in the
newly-retored Norwegian church recently moved to a new site in the docks
area. Roald Dahl, the author, was brought up in the city, his Norwegian
father having established a ship-broking business there, while another
brother went to La Rochelle. As a result, Norway too is on Boyce's list.
'Like the US and the Far East, what a nonsense it would be if we sought to
market ourselves to the whole of Europe. In each of the areas we select, we
will, of course, target particularly relevant industries. That is our thrust
for the next three years.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (8): Early lettings
welcomed - Property: A difficult scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGEST pre-let contracts in the UK, in both 1991 and 1992, were
negotiated on 170 acres of land owned by Grosvenor Waterside, the property
development arm of Associated British Ports, in one segment of Cardiff Bay.
The brick-built, flat-roofed, Welsh Health Common Services Authority
building, covering 150,000 sq ft, and costing Pounds 15m, is now approaching
completion and will be ready for occupation from September. Work is about to
start on a Pounds 16m building for NCM Credit Insurance, which will result
in the creation of a flagship 119,000 sq ft office development built to a
very high specificiation in pink granite, with an atrium, facing the inner
harbour.
Also planned for Capital Waterside, which adjoins the historic Pier Head
building, once the headquarters for all the Great Western Railway's dock
operations, are a new Welsh national opera house, which will be the subject
of an international design competition, a high quality 200-250 bed hotel,
25,000 sq ft of shops and 200 houses.
'These lettings represent a significant commitment to the bay,' according to
Mike Rees, director-in-charge of the Cardiff office of Chesterton. And Rhys
James, partner with DTZ Debenham Thorpe, adds: 'In the present climate these
deals represent real success. Now what Grosvenor Waterside has to do is to
create a better mix on the site. The group needs to find clients who will
take around 10,000 sq ft of space, so that one or two very large buildings
do not dominate. Grosvenor has planning permission for 800,000 sq ft on the
site, which is plenty of capacity for such a mix.'
Despite these two big successes, the general property scene in Cardiff has
not been any easier than elsewhere in Britain as the recession bites. 'There
are clients looking around but they cannot get rid of their present leases,
especially those wanting to move out of the south east of England,' Mr James
says.
Among those looking, according to Mike Hall, of Cooke and Arkwright, are the
Property Services Agency, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's department,
which is seeking 45,000 sq ft for a relocation from London; the insurance
group Axa, which wants about the same space; the Department of Health and
Social Services; and Maryland Bank, an American finance house which is
understood to have Cardiff as one of three potential centres for a European
operation.
Any one of these would continue the office-market momentum developed by the
health authority and NCM. The bay itself, a relatively small part of the
Welsh capital, has been successful in the past two years with a number of
high-profile names arriving, among them the Prudential which took 22,000 sq
ft a year ago at Atlantic House for a regional headquarters for 150 staff.
The bay has been given a further boost with the rescue of Alexandra Gate, a
development on the eastern edge of the bay area, the developer of which was
a local firm which subsequently went into receivership. Welsh Water is to
move its corporate headquarters from another building in the city to
Alexandra Gate, a campus-type development, with the private mining group,
Ryan, and Wales and the West Housing Association taking the other two
blocks.
These moves have met some criticism, however. Chesterton's Mr Hall argues
that the incentive packages offered through public and quasi-public sources
have made comparable city centre schemes uncompetitive.
There are about 200,000 sq ft - 18 months supply - of good-quality
accommodation available in the centre of Cardiff. The largest of these is
Principality Building Society's own development in Queen Street, the city's
main shopping street, where about 55,000 sq ft out of the 65,000 sq ft built
is still available.
Mr Hall also says that potential entrants to the bay, such as Legal and
General, and Canada Life Assurance, have been been frightened off by the
lack of speculative developments, poor access and difficult parking. 'About
100,000 sq ft of offices, both refurbished and second-hand, remain vacant at
the commercial heart of the bay at Mount Stuart Square, but poor
accessibility, specification and parking are likely to result in these
remaining vacant in the short- to medium-term.'
Cardiff rents remain, generally, below those asked in Bristol and further
east along the M4 motorway corridor. DTZ Debenham Thorpe's Mr James believes
around Pounds 16 a sq ft is as much as could be obtained. 'Two years ago we
were hoping to reach the Pounds 20 level'.
The Welsh Health Services building has been let on a 25-year full repair and
insurance lease, at an average rent for the first five years of Pounds 14.50
per sq ft with five year reviews. NCM has negotiated a 15-year lease at a
rate in excess of Pounds 15. The shorter-than-normal term represents a
compromise agreed with Grosvenor Waterside between normal UK practice and
10-year deals, common in the Netherlands where NCM is based. Cooke and
Arkwright's Mike Hall agrees that 'between Pounds 14 and Pounds 16 is about
the top of the market at the moment, especially in the bay'.
These rates, however, take no account of hidden incentives, which neither
developer nor client is willing to discuss. Mr Rees believes a client such
as the Prudential may have extracted a rent-free period equal to 12-18
months rent.
The dice are, naturally, very much loaded in the tenants' favour in the
present economic climate. 'Of all the deals done in Cardiff in the last
year,' says Mr James, 'just over 90 per cent were leasehold. That is, they
were in the tenant's favour, with attractive break clauses and rent-free
periods. The developer is now almost looking to the first rent review to
recover.'
According to Jim Fitzsimmons, the property development manager for Cardiff
Bay, the main developments will come on stream at the right time when the
economy generally is emerging from recession. A key area is known as the
Bridge, located between the city centre and the bay. Here around 1m sq ft of
office development is planned around a new city square at the top of the
main highway out of the bay. 'Once the barrage is completed we expect a
strong level of interest. We will have large amounts of land available, too,
at this time,' Fitzsimmons argues.
Elsewhere there is strong activity at the moment in the retail sector, with
Comet, MFI and McDonalds going to an out-of-town location developed by
television contractor HTV, near a recently opened site on which both Tesco
and Marks and Spencer have stores. In the city centre, too, there is
interest in a development being undertaken on the site of a former Allders
store in the main Queen Street shopping thoroughfare by a London and
Edinburgh Trust (LET) and BICC joint venture.
Known as Queen's Arcade, it is planned to open at Easter 1994, with the
largest units totallling around 25,000 sq ft. Pre-lets have been arranged
with Dolcis, Argos and Leeds Permanent building society, and others are
expected in the next few weeks. Tesco is also taking a prestige site for a
superstore on the western side of the barrage in Penarth Haven, where a
successful marina and housing development has already taken place.
On the industrial side, the Bay has three fully-serviced sites at Ocean
Park, Pengam and Tremorfa. Sites at the 100-acre Ocean Park, which has been
zoned for B1/B2 development, are being offered at Pounds 150,000 per acre on
a 999-year lease with an option to convert to full freehold for a peppercorn
sum. The development is expected eventually to provide 1.2m sq ft of factory
floor space, 150.000 sq ft of offices, 300 homes and 30,000 sq ft of leisure
facilities.
According to the CBDC, there are signs of renewed interest among developers,
with a number of interested parties talking about schemes in the region of
140,000sq ft to 180,000 sq ft.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (6): Fewer homes but
more jobs - The economy: consultants predict even more investment than
expected / KPMG made its initial assessment of the consequences of the
barrage in October 1987. Anthony Moreton analyses the firm's latest report
on its likely impact
</HEADLINE>

A DECISION to go ahead with the barrage will have a very positive impact on
the economy and job prospects in the Cardiff region.
This is the main conclusion of a report by KPMG Management Consultants,
commissioned by Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. It says that the
barrage will lead to much greater investment than expected, and certainly
more than would be achieved by a development without the barrage.
'The informal target' set by the Welsh Office of a leverage of four to one
will be substantially exceeded,' the report states, which puts the likely
private-to-public spending ratio at 7.5 to one.
The number of additional direct jobs likely to be created is also estimated
to be around 78 per cent higher than without the barrage. In total, the
barrage is expected to support 23,200 permanent jobs in the Bay area.
In the construction sector alone, the number of projected extra jobs - at
around 16,500 person-years - is around 88 per cent higher than would have
been the case if there had been no barrage.
KPMG made its first economic assessment of the consequences of the barrage
in October 1987, soon after the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had been
set up. A shortened version of this appraisal was published nine months
later and the original report was updated at the start of 1990. The report
was put before the corporation in February.
By comparison with the 1990 document, the present report sees a reduction in
the number of houses and flats as a result of fewer developments on sites
away from the long waterfront. This is a consequence of the corporation's
land-use proposals, an increase in the number of properties facing water and
significantly reduced development around the inner harbour and some other
parts of the bay area.
The real capital cost of the barrage has increased by Pounds 9.01m since
1990, according to KPMG, or around 6 per cent. Of this rise, Pounds 4.63m
represents the increased cost of remedial work for groundwater protection
following representations from people living alongside the river in Cardiff,
who feared a rise would occur in the water table as the result of the
impounding of water behind the barrage.
Total project investment costs in the barrage are Pounds 497.1m, a fall of
around 21 per cent in real terms since 1990. The main reasons for the drop
have been changes in site preparation and the uncommitted costs of the
Butetown link, the road between the bay and the city centre.
The estimated costs of the barrage are put at Pounds 152.76m at mid 1992
prices, but on some calculations the eventual cost could be as much as 15-18
per cent lower.
The main cost, according to KPMG, is Pounds 47.55m for earthworks, followed
by Pounds 39.62m for the lock structures. Sluices would be Pounds 18.03m and
the sewerage system Pounds 14.8m. The costs of improving groundwater
defences and of building a new home for the displaced birdlife - two
important issues raised by opponents - are put at Pounds 14.43m and Pounds
5.67m respectively.
The report warns there is room for a significant margin of error in
estimating the costs of the required infrastructure and site preparation
work. Nevertheless, the conclusion drawn by the bay's economic consultants
is that the net economic effects will be considerable.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (3): The salmon may be
coming back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BARRAGE has to cope with some of the greatest tidal ranges in the world,
writes Anthony Moreton. The difference between high and low water in Cardiff
can be as much as 14m (about 45ft), putting the city's docks into the same
bracket as Bombay and a few other very deep-water ports.
The Severn estuary is noted for its salmon. The Usk, which comes out at
nearby Newport, and the Wye, which emerges a little further east at
Chepstow, where the present M4 motorway bridge crosses the river, are among
the finest salmon rivers in Britain.
Salmon, though, are not yet an attration in Cardiff's rivers. The Taff, the
Ely and the Rhymney, all of which flow into Cardiff Bay, have been far too
polluted to attract the salmon, or most other lesser fish.
But there is evidence of salmon reappearing, and the 1,100m-long barrage
will incorporate the biggest fish pass in Britain.
Other features in the barrage include:
800m of sand and rock embankments.
Five main sluice gates.
Three navigation locks.
Three bascule bridges.
An outer harbour, requiring 370m of wave-screen breakwater.
In addition, the construction experts estimate there will be:
1,700,000 cubic metres of dredging.
1,500,000 cu m of sand fill.
300,000 cu m of rock fill, armour and scour protection.
140,000 cu m of structural concrete.
20,000 tonnes of steel sheet piling.
All this adds up to the largest construction project of its kind in the UK
this century, according to consulting engineers, Sir Alexander Gibb and
Partners.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (4): Flights diverted
to Llanwern - The ecology: migrant birds are to be given a new stopover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE OF the birds which have used the tidal estuary of the bay as a
staging post on their annual migrations has been one of the most contentious
aspects of the barrage.
The bay, a site of special scientific interest for its avifauna, is home to
thousands of over-wintering birds, which feed principally on the
invertebrates living on the large area of mudflats exposed at low tide.
These creatures themselves feed partly on sewage, emptying into the bay and
carried there from other parts of the Severn estuary by the tide.
Up to 40,000 dunlin, 3,650 curlews, 2,000 redshank and 2,300 shelduck feed
there, with the winter months between November and March particularly
important for them. Other waterfowl and invertebrates also inhabit the area.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Friends of the Earth and
others have been unhappy at the consequences of the development on marine
life and have fought the proposal to build a barrage tenaciously.
The bay's answer has been to find another home for the wildlife. It
commissioned Mason Pittendrigh, of Amersham, in conjunction with David
Bellamy Associates, and other consultants to produce proposals to overcome
the loss of feeding grounds.
Their solution is to create a freshwater wetland habitat covering 650 acres
to the south of the Llanwern steelworks, some 15 miles along the coast east
of Cardiff, and a further 90 acres of saline lagoons nearby. The government
has promised to put up the money for the scheme, which could amount to
around Pounds 6m.
The 500-acre freshwater lake is itself expected to act as a suitable
environment for a wide variety of plants, fish and birds. The development
corporation has been working with environmental bodies to encourage this,
and has designed the banks of the barrage, using vertical stone walls in
some places, and gently sloping ground in others, to create different depths
of water suited to different species of plant.
Three broad categories of plant are expected to grow in and around the lake
 -submerged and floating aquatic plants, emergent plants which normally have
roots under the water but stems and leaves above, and marginal plants which
can occupy saturated land along the edges of freshwater lakes.
These plants will themselves attract a range of small fauna. In addition,
special areas designed to attract and support birdlife are planned. These
could include shallows, small islands or rafts within the body of the lake,
and ponds and scrapes on the edge of the lake to attract birds such as
curlew and snipe which favour shallow water and exposed mud.
The lake will be surrounded by walkways and will be stocked with fresh water
fish, such as roach, bream, carp, and tench, all of which are expected to
flourish and to play a big part in keeping down the midge population and to
maintain water quality. Migratory fish, such as salmon and sea trout will
also be encouraged to swim upriver through a fish pass which will be
installed in the barrage.
A series of related wildlife reserves could also be created in areas
adjoining the freshwater environment of the bay itself.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (2): Anxiety over risk
of floods - The opposition: Anthony Moreton tells how concessions were
secured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON

<TEXT>
A LONG battle has taken place to prevent the barrage being built, a campaign
which came near to succeeding. Opponents, though few in number, fought the
hybrid bill necessary to sanction the barrage tenaciously through both
houses of parliament almost line by line and caused considerable delays to
its implementation.
Such a parliamentary measure has been necessary because navigational and
other water rights were involved, as well as others involving different
government departments and local authorities. Private bills can only be
introduced into parliament on one day in the year, late in November, and if
there are too many of them on the same day some are lost and have to wait a
further year to be represented.
The barrage bill did not fail on this count, but it was soon evident that a
number of people, both in Cardiff itself and elsewhere in Wales, were
opposed to the scheme. Most of them owned houses alongside the Taff, the
city's main river, and feared the lagoon created by the barrage would affect
the water table and cause flooding when abnormal amounts of water came down
from the mountains of upper south Wales.
Even without the barrage impounding water, they had suffered from flooding
several times in the recent past. It was claimed that as many as 12,000
houses could be affected by any rise in groundwater levels.
There were also environmental issues. Several rare breeds of birdlife,
especially dunlin, redshank, curlews and shelduck use the bay, which is a
site of special scientific interest (SSSI), as feeding grounds. The Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds became concerned and joined the
opponents. The numbers of these birds are not large - no one put the figure
above 50,000 - but they caused problems out of proportion to their numbers.
There were, too, other environmental issues which brought Friends of the
Earth into the fray. As recently as last February, it was saying that if the
barrage were to be built there could be water pollution problems leading to
growth of poisonous blue-green algae, proliferation of midges and creation
of an environment leading to the potential for spread of leptospire
bacteria. 'The people of Cardiff do not want the problems of damp, midges,
algae or Weil's disease,' they argued. They also urged that SSSIs, such as
Cardiff Bay, needed to be extended, not reduced.
These fears prompted a small group of Labour MPs, headed by Rhodri Morgan
(Cardiff West), to mount a highly effective sniping campaign during the
passage of the bill. Mr Morgan's constituency does not actually cover the
bay itself - it is an irony that his Labour colleague Alun Michael (Cardiff
South and Penarth), who does represent the bay, has all along been a strong
supporter of the scheme - but, as many of the complainants worried about
water-table levels do live in his constituency, he had good grounds to lead
the opposition.
He was backed by a few other Labour MPs, and by Plaid Cymru, the Welsh
nationalist party, which advocated that any government money spent on
projects in Wales should be shared geographically across the country rather
than concentrated in Cardiff.
The opponents secured a series of concessions. In the spring of 1990 they
persuaded a Commons select committee to pass the bill back to the Welsh
Secretary on a technicality, a move that probably added at least a year to
the bill's passage.
Almost exactly a year later, Mr Morgan and his supporters won their greatest
parliamentary triumph by talking the bill out in the Commons following an
all-night sitting lasting 13 hours. The private bill was dropped and the
government picked up the measure and began the long journey to royal assent
all over again.
That success, in April 1991, is the last main victory to fall the way of the
opponents. They have won important concessions along the way since then, but
the bill is now expected to receive royal assent either before parliament
rises for the summer or immediately the session resumes in the autumn.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (5): Opera, heritage
and technology - Leisure: an international view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW opera house for the world-renowned Welsh National Opera Company will
lie at the heart of Cardiff Bay.
Grosvenor Waterside has provided a site facing the inner harbour for the
Pounds 40m building; a financial package is being put together under the
aegis of the Welsh Arts Council; government support, crucial to such a
public scheme, is now (at least, unofficially) committed; and an
architectural competition will be held to ensure that the building compares
with the best in the world.
The opera house will be a centre for the performing arts. This was always
the intention of Lord Crickhowell, secretary of state for Wales between 1979
and 1987, who did so much to get the project moving, but it is also meant to
be a statement that Cardiff bay, and the Welsh capital in general, represent
an international arena able to play host to any event which is looking for a
home.
The opera house is not the only international centre planned. Long before
the first curtain call on the opening evening, Cardiff bay will have
National Techniquest, a hands-on science discovery centre, and a vastly
enlarged industrial and maritime museum.
Techniquest's new home, costing Pounds 7.5m, is now being built, and
Professor John Beetlestone, its director, hopes the doors will be open by
the autumn of next year.
The industrial museum, an arm of the National Museum of Wales, was opened in
1977 and the extention - costing about Pounds 25-30m - is a longer-term
project. If work starts next year it should be completed around the turn of
the century.
All three - opera house, Techniquest and museum - are part of the drive to
internationalise the city. Techniquest was opened in November 1986, the
brainchild of Beetlestone. Children - from 9 to 90 - can play with, or
operate, the exhibits, and with 100,000 visitors this year it has become one
of the leading attractions in Wales.
The building now under construction will allow the centre to develop its
full potential. 'The quality of our exhibits already has international
recognition,' Beetlestone says. 'We have sold our exhibits to the similar
facility in Toronto, one of the first to be set up in the world, to the
Australian National Science and Technical Centre in Canberra, and to
Eksperimentarium in Copenhagen. Canberra has 24 exhibits which originated in
Cardiff.
Professor Beetlestone believes there has to be harmony between the exhibits
and the buildings in which they are housed, something which he claims is
missing both in Canberra and in Helsinki's famous Eureka centre. 'Helsinki
may have won awards for its architecture, but people there admit they are
working against the building. In Australia, although the building is just
200 yards from parliament and next to the national library and the law
courts, it does not work as an exhibition centre.' To overcome difficulties
of this sort, Cardiff has commissioned an international architect, Paul
Koralec, of ABK, to design a place in which there is natural harmony between
shell and contents.
Futuristic conceptions may be a little beyond the industrial and maritime
museum, but Dr Stuart Owen-Jones, the keeper, believes he will be able to
achieve similar results. Development at the industrial building in Cardiff
Bay can now be considered because the Pounds 26m work on new galleries
within the main building in the city's Cathays Park civic centre is drawing
to a close, ready for its official opening in October. 'Development in
Cardiff Bay is the logical next step,' Mr Alistair Wilson, director of the
National Museum of Wales, of which the industrial museum is a part, says.
Any industrial museum needs far more space than one devoted to pottery,
paintings or small artefacts. By its nature, much of industrial machinery is
large. The National Museum of Wales has many exhibits which it simply cannot
display.
Despite this problem, the industrial museum has doubled its attendance
figures to around 70,000 over the past three years, as increasing emphasis
has been put on a range of exhibitions and school programmes.
'Now that we know the infrastructure which will be put in pace in Cardiff
Bay, we are in a much better position to plot our own future,' Dr Owen-Jones
says. 'We know the industrial and maritime museum will be an integral part
of the inner harbour and this allows us to plan ahead with some confidence.
'We intend to ensure that Cardiff's role as a leading coal-exporting port,
and Wales's place as one of the most important coal-producing countries in
the world, are fully reflected.
'But we shall not just be looking to the past. The museum will be about the
industries that replaced coal and steel and slate and chemicals. Like
Techniquest and the opera house, we intend to be a museum with international
status.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (1): 'A Covent Garden
by the sea' - Despite strong opposition, approval is expected early in the
autumn for one of Europe's most ambitious development projects. Now comes
the task of finding the necessary investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN ROYAL assent to the private bill allowing construction of a barrage
across Cardiff Bay has finally been received later this year, the
multi-million pound development of the Welsh capital's docklands, one of the
biggest investment projects in Europe, will at last begin.
Workmen will then move in to make the first investigations for what Sir
Geoffrey Inkin - chairman of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation since
it was set up six years ago - describes as 'probably the biggest development
job in Britain now that work on the Channel Tunnel is ending.'
The barrage, which will impound a 500-acre freshwater lake large enough to
play host to Olympic rowing events, will unlock some eight miles of
waterside development potential.
'We are going to build a capital to grace the 21st century,' says Inkin.
'The regeneration of Cardiff Bay is one of the most ambitious projects of
its kind in Europe.'
'The period of preparation and planning will be behind us. The next step
will be to produce something tangible,' adds Michael Boyce, chief executive
of the corporation, adds.
It will be at least three years before the barrage, which is likely to cost
around Pounds 140m, is in place, but within 12 months Boyce predicts
enormous changes in an area which, before the first world war, was known as
Tiger Bay, hinterland of the greatest coal-exporting port in the world.
New buildings are already rising. A home for the Welsh Health Common
Services Authority is approaching the fitting-out stage, and work has
started on a new headquarters for the Dutch group, NCM Insurance Services.
Both are on land owned by Grosvenor Waterside, property arm in Cardiff of
Associated British Ports. International architects Holder Mathias Alcock
have converted an Edwardian building for their own use, while a hotel,
houses, restaurants, offices and small industrial units are all up.
By this time next year, Boyce forecasts, a start will also have been made on
the Butetown link, an avenue the width of the Champs Elysees, which will
join the docks to the city centre; a university complex which will
eventually house 3,000 students; and one of Harry Ramsden's world-famous
fish-and-chip restaurants, as well as lesser fry.
Much of the impetus is expected to come from the tourism and leisure
facilities that will be created in the bay area. A new home for National
Techniquest, a hands-on science discovery centre, should also be approaching
completion in a year's time, the Rainbow Theatre and the Sky Shuttle will
arrive from the 1992 Ebbw Vale Garden Festival site, a start should be made
on a county cricket ground, and supermarkets will be under construction, as
well as a Pounds 100m marine haven.
Work should also have begun on improving the city's central station, the
orientation of which will be changed so that it has frontages to the south -
the bay area - as well as to the north into the traditional city centre.
There are plans, too, for an international opera house. When Nicholas
Edwards (now Lord Crickhowell) launched the idea of redeveloping Cardiff Bay
in a local hotel in December 1986, he emphasised the need for a centre for
the performing arts. He wanted a building to compete in eye-catching design
with Sydney Opera House. With the Welsh National Opera Company as the
resident company he also wanted a house which could rival Covent Garden, the
Met or La Scala.
Such a scheme needs government financial backing. While the Welsh Office has
still to spell out its commitment, it has given tacit backing to an
architectural competition, the result of which should be announced in 12
months' time.
Not everything has gone smoothly over the past seven years. Opponents of the
barrage have caused delays which, at one time, threatened the scheme. Their
case has centred on environmental issues, in particular the loss of valuable
breeding grounds for over-wintering birds, and on groundwater problems in
neighbouring areas of the city as a result of the rise in the water-table
behind the barrage.
Rhodri Morgan, a Cardiff Labour MP, organised a campaign of harassment in
parliament, proving that the day of the constituency member was far from
over.
He exploited two important issues, bringing about the collapse of the first
bill and forcing the government to come to the rescue and put it through
parliament a second time. Morgan drew attention to the fact that up to
11,000 houses could be affected by a rise in the water-table as a
consequence of the creation of the lake behind the barrage. This was a
highly sensitive issue in a city that has suffered flooding several times as
a result of a rise in the Taff, which, with the Ely, is one of two rivers
that pour out into the bay.
He also worked with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in a
campaign to prevent the destruction of a site of special scientific
interest, which was home for several species of rare birds.
The bill's opponents also disputed the development corporation's forecast
that 25,000 jobs would be created over the next 10 to 15 years, argued that
estimates of 4-5m sq ft of office space being built were pie in the sky.
They suggested, too, that the Pounds 140m cost of the barrage was an
underestimate, and challenged cost-benefit analyses prepared for the
project.
Inkin's team had produced an economic report which suggested that the
barrage would add Pounds 119m in net value, from new building and other
economic activity, and had asserted that, if it were not built, investment
totalling Pounds 153m would flow out. The benefit from having a barrage was,
therefore, put at Pounds 272m.
Inkin has always maintained that Cardiff Bay, in Europe second only in
development potential to London's docklands, could go ahead without the
barrage. Equally, he has insisted that the barrage is essential to unlock
the full benefits.
Time will prove or disprove the accuracy of the estimates. The argument,
however, should soon be over, and as a result of the parliamentary sanction
now obtained, Cardiff will have its barrage by 1996.
The first steps towards putting the city on the international map, so as to
attract the investment that will be needed if this dream is to be fulfilled,
have already been taken. On May 18, Cardiff Bay launched its latest
marketing campaign, before an invited audience in the City of London. The
Princess of Wales was there, as, too, were members of the Welsh National
Opera Company. Welsh artists Shirley Bassey and Sir Anthony Hopkins sent
messages of support.
'We want the rest of the world to know about Cardiff,' says Boyce.' Our
strategy is to build the bay and Cardiff, which we see as one city, into a
leading centre for tourism and leisure pursuits. With a new home for
National Techniquest, an extension of the National Museum of Wales's
industrial and maritime building at Pier Head, with the opera house, and
with new restaurants and festival shopping, the bay can be a grand Covent
Garden by the sea.
'But Cardiff Bay will not just be about attracting 2m visitors a year by the
turn of the century. Our strategy envisages strengthening the financial
services sector, the growth of which has been a feature of recent investment
in the city. We also want a strong manufacturing centre, especially in food,
electronics, pharmaceuticals and the media. Cardiff is already the most
important television production centre in Britain outside London, and we
want to develop and expand that strength.'
Efforts to attract investment will be focused within Europe on the so-called
'motor' regions, such as Baden-Wurttemberg, Rhone-Alpes and Lombardy, the
economies of which are growing rapidly; on north American cities such as
Baltimore and San Francisco; and on Korea and Taiwan.
'And on Australia,' adds Boyce, 'our research has shown that New South Wales
alone has 200 companies which are too large to operate internationally from
the state. They could expand comfortably from old South Wales.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / Management: What type of boss are you?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hay uses its own management style definitions - variations are used by other
researchers. The styles are characterised as:
Coercive: do it the way I tell you. Provides clear direction; does not
listen; expects immediate compliance; controls tightly, requiring many
detailed reports; gives negative feedback; motivates by threats of
discipline or punishment.
Effective in a crisis but ineffective over the long term because
subordinates are not developed. Ineffective with higher-level technical and
professional staff.
Authoritative: firm but fair. Gives clear directions tactfully; listens to
others' ideas; explains directions and decisions in terms of subordinates'
or the organisation's interests; monitors performance; gives positive and
negative feedback.
Effective in large, complex organisations; when clear directions and
standards are needed and when the manager is seen as an expert. Does not
work when manager does not develop subordinates.
Affiliative: people first, tasks second. Has no clear goals or standards;
most concerned with personal popularity; wants to keep people happy; rewards
for personal characteristics, rather than job performance.
Style works when work is routine and subordinates perform adequately, or
when conflicting groups or individuals need to be brought together.
Ineffective when people not performing well, or clear direction needed.
Democratic: participative. Trusts subordinates, rather than supervising
closely; makes decisions by consensus, holding many meetings and listening;
rewards adequate performance but rarely punishes.
Effective way of managing when subordinates are competent, well-informed,
need co-ordinating. Can have drawbacks in a crisis or when subordinates not
competent.
Pace-setting: 'do it myself'. Leads by example, has high standards but
trouble delegating. Coercive when performance is poor and does not develop
others. Lone wolves, provide little co-ordination or social support.
Style works when subordinates highly motivated and competent. Not as
effective when delegation needed, or when subordinates need development and
co-ordination.
Coaching: developmental. Managers see job as showing subordinates how to
improve. Get them to set their own goals and identify solutions to problems.
Style is effective when subordinates want to develop. Does not work as well
when manager lacks expertise or when subordinates need direction, or in a
crisis.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Management: How to stand out in a crowd - Getting yourself
noticed in the jobs market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the 1980s were years of 'boom and bloom' in the US, the 1990s look like
being chronicled for their 'doom and gloom'.
With more than 9m unemployed in the US (approximately 7 per cent of the
workforce), redundancy victims are adopting new tactics to increase their
chances of re-entering the diminishing permanent job market.
'Think portfolio,' urges Marty Nemko, a career consultant and radio
presenter based in Oakland, California. He advises jobless clients to
discard their old curriculum vitae. In its place he prescribes a marketing
document which pieces together only specific projects and experience
directly relevant to the position the candidate is seeking.
Since applicants can be up against anything from 500-800 competing hopefuls
for a single position, 'make your application applicable and unique', says
Nemko.
His recipe for an effective portfolio includes a variety of marketing tools.
For a teacher that might incorporate a lesson plan, a video tape of the
candidate in action, samples of students' work and a superior's evaluation
of the project.
'Old-type resumes are archaic and Neanderthal,' says Nemko. 'Employers view
them as puff pieces of propaganda. They bear no relation to the job at
hand.'
Keith Copeland, manger of employment at Apple Computer, agrees that
applicants should try to stand out. He recommends a one- or two-page CV
highly tailored to the job on offer. 'Be focused. Make an impact. Show you
have understood the position and demonstrate how your skills and your
experience relate.'
The portfolio approach worked for 48-year-old Carolyn Stull, who was forced
to look for a new job in 1991.
'When I first began my job search I came across many companies who 10 years
ago would have been interested in me. But whereas in the past they might
have accepted a candidate with 80 per cent of the required job skills, today
they can get a specialist on board with all the required skills.'
Stull's initial lack of success incited her to begin her own business as a
freelance grant writer, pairing organisations requiring project finance with
fund donors. Once she had handled several projects independently she was
able to craft her own portfolio CV with summarised case studies taken from
her own experience. The result was an executive directorship with the
California Foundation for the Retarded.
With thousands more applicants than vacancies, employers can afford to
demand specific skills, thus paring out the middle management generalists.
Lee Harris, director of employment at the Bank of America, finds that the
pool of redundant resources on the market has reduced the bank's entry-level
recruitment programme. 'Whereas we would have brought in people to train
them up, now we can hire individuals with all the required skills
immediately,' says Harris.
With only 15 per cent of redundant workers presently expecting to be
recalled to their former field of employment, compared with 40 per cent
following past recessions, victims of America's downsizing have a big
challenge on their hands. 'Think job light. Accept change as a friend. And
don't take yourself too seriously,' advises management guru Tom Peters, from
his Vermont-based office.
Consultants urge candidates to consider lower-salaried positions, to add to
their skill base and retrain on to leading-edge technology. Time out of
employment should be used to undertake voluntary or part-time work which is
job related and can be added to the resume.
'And, of course, network,' urges Robert Chope, a psychologist and director
of the Careers and Personal Development Institute in San Francisco. 'Use
people as you have never used them before. Tell the clerk in the
supermarket, the teller at the bank that you are looking for a job. It's
nothing to be ashamed of these days.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / Management: Perceptions of leadership - New findings that
examine the way the sexes rate male and female managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women prefer a female boss; men would rather work for men. Female managers
are not seen by their male subordinates as acting in an authoritative
manner.
Both male and female managers are considerably less effective in the way
they manage than they would like to imagine.
Evidence that all these provocative-sounding assertions may be true comes
from research carried out over the past few months in Britain's National
Health Service but with implications for managers of both sexes and in all
sectors.
The unpublished study is believed to be one of the first of its kind.
Trent Regional Health Authority covers one of the largest geographical
health regions in the UK - South Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire,
Derbyshire and Leicestershire - and a population of 4.5m. There are 75,000
staff in the region, 85 per cent of whom are female.
In common with the rest of the NHS, Trent is staffed mainly by women but run
by men: just 11 per cent of general managers and chief executives in the
region are female.
As part of the employer-led equality drive Opportunity 2000, the health
service overall has a government target of increasing its proportion of
female general managers from 18 per cent in 1991 to 30 per cent by 1994.
To meet these tough targets (some would say they are unrealistic, given the
recession and low staff turnover) specialised training for potential women
managers is being examined throughout the NHS.
Trent asked Hay Management Consultants in January this year to investigate
what women's training needs in the region might be, first establishing
whether there are any differences in the way men and women operate as
managers. This hotly debated area is normally characterised by
generalisation and anecdote - scientific research on men and women as bosses
is thin on the ground.
What Hay did was to question male and female managers about how they thought
they operated and then, revealingly, to ask those managers' subordinates
what they thought of the way their bosses managed.
At the same time, the 'organisational climate' - perceptions about the
quality of the working environment - was charted and linked to the findings
on management style.
Climate takes into account the strength of working relationships, pride in
the organisation, how far individuals feel they are given real
responsibility and rewarded for performance, and the extent to which
challenging but clear and realistic goals are set. Previous research has
shown there exists a strong link between a positive climate and good
individual performance.
A total of 15 male and 20 female middle managers completed questionnaires
about how they saw their own styles, while 191 staff, male and female,
answered questions about their bosses. About the same number of staff filled
in the organisational climate survey.
All managers thought they were high on authoritative, affiliative,
democratic and coaching styles - a view not matched by their subordinates,
who perceived them as being more coercive and pace-setting than the managers
imagined themselves to be.
The styles which produced the highest-quality climates were authoritative,
democratic and coaching; pace-setting and coercive styles produced the
worst. As Hay concludes in its report to Trent 'in practice, managers are
using the least effective styles more than they think'.
Another finding was that reporting to a manager of the same sex appeared to
produce a more positive climate for both male and female subordinates.
There were only marginal differences in the way male and female managers saw
themselves. However, the picture was entirely different when it came to the
way subordinates of different sexes rated male and female bosses.
Most strikingly, men did not rate their female managers as acting in an
authoritative manner, although women did see their female bosses as using
this management style. What the men saw was their women managers using the
pace-setting style. To compound matters, pace-setting had a more negative
effect on organisational climate when used by women than when men employed
it.
As Hay points out, this difference may be accounted for by differing male
and female perceptions of women managers, or it may be that the women were
treating male and female subordinates differently.
Whatever the reason, concludes the research, 'the styles that female
managers use are not working as effectively with their male subordinates.
The men do not see female managers doing such things as giving clear
directions, explaining decisions and monitoring task performance. The
authoritative style is an effective and important one. If women are not seen
as using it by men this may not only affect their team's effectiveness but
could influence their visibility with colleagues and bosses'.
Specialised management training for women, using the Hay findings, may now
be developed by Trent. The research has also revealed the scope that there
is for managers of both sexes to increase their repertoire of management
styles and, for men in particular, to learn from their female colleagues
more about how to be effective in coaching their subordinates.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Battle is waged in 'local' Derby: The review of local
government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy.
FT reporters examine the issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LOCAL Government Commission knew its suggestion of two unitary
authorities for Derbyshire would be open to criticism.
Its recommendation, one of four options it considered for the shape of local
government in the county, is 'the least satisfactory in terms of community
identity', it acknowledged.
It tried to buttress its choice by advocating devolved management of
services to the community level, and to build on what it called local
centres of identity 'an enhanced role for town and parish councils'.
The district councils emphasise community identity as they strain to make
the case for their own survival intact or - failing that - merged with a
neighbour. But even as they manoeuvre to break down the commission proposal
of just one authority outside the city of Derby, their own position in
deferring to local community identity may be just as weak as that of the
commission.
Earlier this year MORI, the research organisation, found that Derbyshire
residents expressed a strong sense of attachment to their local
neighbourhood (in urban areas) or village (in rural parts of the county).
Identification with district areas was less pronounced, with the exception
of the strong attachment expressed towards Chesterfield, and identification
with the county less pronounced again.
But MORI also reported that, as a factor determining the shape of local
government, a sense of local community was deemed important only by 3 per
cent of the sample.
By far the most important factor was that the structure should respond to
the wishes of local people, followed by the cost and quality of services.

<TEXT>
THE CREATION of unitary authorities should reduce central administration
costs and overheads, says the local government commission. But the potential
expense of new civic centres has not been quantified.
In Avon the commission has proposed that a single authority be created from
the existing district councils of Northavon and Kingswood, to the north and
east of Bristol. Both have modern purpose-built council offices. Northavon's
offices were built six years ago at a cost of about Pounds 2.5m and
Kingswood's 11 years ago.
Both lack the space, or adjacent land which could be developed, to act as
the headquarters of a single large authority - unless many administrative
services were housed elsewhere. They are 13 miles apart along congested
roads and if one civic centre became the new town hall residents from the
other district might object to the distance.
The two councils are still pressing the case to become unitary authorities
in their own right and say it is premature to consider the cost of new
headquarters. Both point out that the existing civic centres could be used
as area offices.
At a recent public meeting in Kingswood the commission was criticised for
not favouring the option of the area having its own unitary authority. Miss
Mary Leigh, one of the commissioners, said they believed that only an
authority the size of Kingswood and Northavon combined - 220,000 people -
could provide strategic planning.

<TEXT>
When construction of the Humber bridge started in 1972 the south bank of the
estuary was in Lincolnshire and the north in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
In 1974 the county of Humberside was created, with the bridge at its heart
and including Hull on the north of the river and Grimsby and Scunthorpe to
the south. Planners believed that the physical link between the two banks
would establish common interests but north and south do not seem to have
developed such a county identity. If the Local Government Commission's
proposals are accepted the bridge will soon run from North Lincolnshire to
East Yorkshire. Humberside will be abolished.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Langbaurgh left in options limbo: The review of local
government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy.
FT reporters examine the issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY CONFUSION over precisely which is the Local Government Commission's
preferred option for the Cleveland borough of Langbaurgh is, it says, in the
minds of inattentive journalists influenced by hostile publicity.
In May the commission announced its preferred Cleveland option was four new
unitary authorities, including Langbaurgh, based on existing borough council
boundaries.
One non-preferred option was to scrap Langbaurgh, splitting its territory
between Middlesbrough and a new Yorkshire unitary authority.
Then in June the commission announced its preferred option for North
Yorkshire, based on the historic Ridings. 'The North Riding would cover the
area of the present districts of Hambleton, Richmondshire, Ryedale,
Scarborough and (possibly) that part of the district of Langbaurgh which was
formerly in Yorkshire,' it said.
This, critics say, conflicts with its preferred Cleveland option. Not so,
says the commission. 'You have preferred option A, which is with Langbaurgh,
and preferred option B without it,' it said.
The commission added that while it was obliged to state a preferred option,
'it's still hedged around with a degree of vagueness because further
consultation could lead the commission to change its mind'.
What Langbaurgh's 143,000 residents think is far from clear. Only 582
returned a coupon in the council's free newspaper, delivered to all 59,000
homes, requesting their views. Of the 582, 35.7 per cent backed the
commission's preferred Cleveland option.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Council reformer meets resistance: Why the Banham ideas are
attracting strong criticism - The review of local government structure
itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy. FT reporters examine
the issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN BANHAM'S review of local government in England, which started
announcing proposals for reorganising councils in May, is now itself
destined for a wide-ranging review.
Although the measure was supported by politicians of all parties and was
intended to proceed on the basis of consensus, it has so far aroused fierce
controversy in each of the four areas for which proposals have been
announced. Final reports for these areas are not due until September.
The review, in five tranches, has already recommended creating 24 unitary
councils in place of 66 county and district councils.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has said that changes to the
review will be announced soon - probably this week - amid speculation that
the review might effectively be abandoned. Mr Gummer could change its policy
remit, or make the review voluntary with councils needing to 'opt in'. He is
also under pressure to speed the programme, at present timetabled to last
another three years.
County and district councils have had totally opposing reactions so far, and
business leaders have been scathing. The proposals for North Yorkshire were
labelled 'Shambleshire' by Lady Elizabeth Anson, deputy chairman of the
Association of District Councils.
The review owes its current form to Mr Michael Heseltine, who announced it
as environment secretary in 1991. Unlike the reorganisations in Scotland and
Wales, which were decided by ministers, Mr Heseltine's idea was that an
independent commission should be appointed to consult closely at the
grassroots.
He hoped to deliver local councils which would command popularity with their
electors, unlike the artificial 'counties' created by the last review in
1973, and give back self-governance to the cities - such as Bristol and
Leicester - which had lost their status in the last review.
The first of the review's five tranches took in all the most disliked
'artificial' counties - Avon, Cleveland and Humberside - plus their
surrounding areas, and Derbyshire.
Mr Heseltine also aimed to resolve the debate on the merits of two-tier
councils - with counties having some functions while others are taken by
smaller districts - and unitary councils. England's metropolitan districts
and London boroughs are already unitary, and are untouched by the review.
Critics have been angered by the review's piecemeal nature, which has led to
widely differing outcomes in different counties. However, these stem from
the government's policy guidance, which was intentionally left vague.
This states: 'The commission should examine each area which the secretary of
state directs it to review to see whether a unitary structure would better
reflect the identities and interests of local communities and secure
effective and convenient local government. It should weigh the costs of
change, including the transitional costs, against the benefits of its
proposals.'
On an overall structure, the government 'does not wish to impose a national
blueprint for reform, or to require the wholesale abolition of either
district or county councils'. But it expects 'a substantial increase in the
number of unitary authorities'.
Two flaws quickly became apparent. Measuring cost and community identity,
and balancing between them, have proved almost impossible tasks. Reconciling
these problems without falling foul of the charge that it was 'imposing a
blueprint' proved to be beyond the commission.
The model for cost-effectiveness of different proposals, drawn up by the
accountants Ernst &amp; Young, is at the heart of the problem. E&amp;Y said that
costs would be affected in four areas - staff (which accounts for more than
75 per cent), accommodation, information systems, and the 'cost of
democracy' (which includes any extra administrative costs from holding
elections for different areas).
E&amp;Y's analysis of staff costs showed a hefty 'economy of scale'. While
councils with a population of 50,000 or less needed more than five
administrative staff per 1,000 population, this number dropped to 3.5 for a
population of 300,000, and below three for populations of more than 1m.
These assessments led to several proposed large county-based authorities,
notably in Derbyshire, Durham, North Yorkshire and Somerset, to the fury of
district councillors.
The Association of District Councils objects to the E&amp;Y model, and says
estimates of cost savings should be decided by meetings between counties and
districts. But when E&amp;Y asked counties and districts for estimated staff
costs, it found wide disparities.
Differences between counties and districts have hampered the review in other
ways. The districts, which called for the review and hoped to achieve
unitary status for all districts, maintaining their current boundaries, are
disappointed.
The other alternative facing Mr Gummer is to allow councils to 'opt in' by
inviting the commission to review them. The government could set targets for
the number of councillors or electors who would need to be in favour, making
the process essentially voluntary. Counties would support this, but
districts believe it could be a camouflaged exit from the entire review.

and signed by 100 MPs, calls for section 22 of the 1989 Social Security Act
to be repealed. This allows the Department of Social Security to reclaim
welfare benefits paid to victims who win more than Pounds 2,500 damages in
legal cases against their employers.
The Trades Union Congress, which has been campaigning for the law to be
changed so that victims keep all the money awarded, says present rules
depress compensation levels and encourage insurers to delay cases. The TUC
argues that damages reclaimed by the DSS are awarded as compensation for
disablement, or as punitive damages.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Business gives VAT rules cool response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST six months of the European single-market rules on value added tax
have yielded no benefits for the UK companies affected, a survey by
accountants Price Waterhouse shows.
Respondents asked to compare the possible benefits - such as the savings in
time to carry goods across the European Community - with drawbacks - such as
the additional requirements to report trade data - said they had not gained.
The abolition of customs checks on January 1 meant companies had to record
their own VAT information and compile their own trading records.
Smaller exporters and importers are required to file quarterly trade figures
to Customs while larger traders must make monthly returns.
Customs has calculated that the changeover would cost British business
Pounds 100m in the first year but then lead to net annual savings of Pounds
135m.
The survey showed that 68 per cent of companies questioned were financially
worse off than before. The biggest single difficulty was the completion of
the trade statistics.
One middle-ranking multinational had found compiling the trade data so
complex that it had failed to make any returns.
The second main area of complaint was the changes companies had to make to
their computer systems. One company spent Pounds 500,000 on its computers.
Mr Mike Arnold, VAT partner at Price Waterhouse, said transport companies
did not appear to be passing on the benefits of faster transport times
either in their schedules or in the prices they were quoting.
There were also difficulties in dealing with some other member states,
notably France, Italy and Spain. Some countries insisted on foreign
companies registering locally for VAT while UK companies had encountered
problems in obtaining the VAT registration numbers of customers in these
countries.
Forty six per cent of the UK companies interviewed said they were not
looking forward to the prospect of a second round of VAT changes, intended
to simplify the system and planned for 1997.
Only 30 per cent were in favour of the next round of changes.
Price Waterhouse's respondents ranged from 'smallish' public companies to
big multinationals, to which it provided VAT advice in the approach to the
single market.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Thousands of commuters to face disruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thousands of London commuters face disruption of railway services to and
from Charing Cross station today, Tim King writes.
British Rail will not run any trains to Waterloo East or Charing Cross for
the next three weeks. The stations have been closed because work at London
Bridge (above) has cut off the entry route. Main line services from Ashford,
Kent and suburban line services from Dartford via Bexleyheath are being
diverted to Victoria and the frequency of trains will be reduced. All other
services are being diverted to Cannon Street. Tickets issued by British Rail
for travel to Charing Cross will be valid on the Underground between Cannon
Street and Victoria stations. The Underground station at Cannon Street will
be open longer hours and at the weekend. British Rail is paying London
Transport to provide extra buses from Cannon Street.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Support expressed for reform of tenancy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE to the tax regime governing service-charge sinking funds would be
supported by nearly 90 per cent of property owners, users and advisers, says
a survey by the law firm Cameron Markby Hewitt.
It found that reform of taxation on sinking funds - the sum put aside by
tenants each year to pay for large items of capital expenditure - to permit
a better spread of service charge costs was the most popular of several
potential changes to commercial lease law.
The next most popular reform would be the removal of empty rates on
unlettable buildings, a move backed by nearly eight out of 10 of the
respondents.
The survey also found that there was strong support for an improvement to
the landlord's right to enforce breaches in a tenant's obligation to repair
the building.
The 120 respondents to the survey were landlords (34 per cent), tenants (8
per cent), companies that combined the functions of landlord and tenant (14
per cent) and others (44 per cent).
The government is considering reforms to several aspects of commercial lease
law, covering upward-only rent review clauses, confidentiality clauses and
dispute resolution procedures. A consultation paper governing these issues
was published in May. It has already announced plans to reform the law of
privity of contract.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Shift in spread of SE listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON AND south-east England continued to lose companies quoted on the
Stock Exchange to the recession in 1992-93, shifting the balance of where
quoted companies are located in Britain.
According to BWD Rensburg, the quoted Huddersfield-based stockbroker,
Britain's regions had 666 quoted companies in June. There were gains in the
regions where greater economic resilience has brought more new quotations
than those lost through receivership, administration, takeovers or mergers.
London lost a net 23 quoted companies - 13 new listings compared with 36
losses of Stock Exchange quotations. Its latest total is 505 companies. The
rest of the south-east also lost 23 listings - five gains to 28 losses -
with its total falling to 337.
More than half of the quoted companies outside the south-east are in three
regions: Yorkshire and Humberside, the west Midlands - they have 125 each -
and north-west England, where there are 111.
Scotland gained five listings but lost three to reach its total of 70.
South-west England gained four and lost none to record 68. The east Midlands
lost four but gained only three, slipping to 66 listings.
Of the remaining quoted companies in the regions 37 were in East Anglia and
34 in the north-east and Cumbria - each region was up one from three gains
and two losses during the year. There were 21 in Wales, where three listings
were lost and none gained.
BWD's analysis shows 216 companies in the FTSE Small Capitalised companies
index are in the regions, compared with 103 in London and 90 in the rest of
the south-east.

FT  26 JUL 93 / House prices forecast to rise 8.5% before 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES will rise a further 8.5 per cent by the end of 1994, according
to National Westminster Bank's chief economist.
The bank's economic forecasts, to be published next month, expect East
Anglia, east Midlands and Wales to see prices rise faster than the rest of
the UK, and Greater London to lag behind. The same picture emerges from
Business Strategies, an economic forecaster, in its regional forecasts
published today.
A preview of the bank's national and regional forecasts shows most of the
rise in house prices - 7.5 per cent - will come next year.
Mr David Kern, chief economist, said that the second half of this year would
see only a 'modest' increase of about 0.9 per cent, after a 3 per cent rise
in the first six months.
The bank's report says house prices in East Anglia, east Midlands and Wales
will rise by 10 per cent by the end of next year, and in Greater London by
only 6.9 per cent.
The rest of the south-east, with an expected increase of 8.3 per cent, will
be only slightly behind the average.
The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP of 1.5 per cent this year,
increasing to 2.2 per cent next year, and on the level of employment
reaching 'a cyclical low point around September 1993' and then growing 'by
some 240,000 or 1 per cent' by the end of next year.
Business Strategies' regional planning service report expects a higher rate
of GDP growth of 2.8 per cent both next year and in 1995. 'The strongest
impetus for recovery is coming from the manufacturing sector, as a result of
last September's depreciation of sterling and major new inward investments,
such as the Japanese car plants,' it says.
The south-east, like the south-west, is affected by the 'hangover of the
late 1980s boom' - personal and corporate debt, the squeeze on the financial
sector and the impact of defence cuts.
In the longer run, Business Strategies says, the south-east's growth will
catch up with the rest of the UK as house price rises 'help to buttress
(consumer) spending and support the construction sector'.
It adds, however, that 'unemployment in London will be very hard to bring
down', partly because of productivity growth in services.
As a result the region is unlikely to regain 'its lost share of the UK
economy' and 'the chances of a 1980s style of north - south divide are
remote'.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Unison chief issues threat on pay limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Unison, the new large public-sector union, has warned that it
will be seeking to demonstrate its industrial muscle if the government
attempts a further year of pay restrictions.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, who as well as being general secretary of Unison also
chairs the TUC's public services committee, wants a meeting with Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to warn him of a co-ordinated union offensive
against further pay restraint in the coming public expenditure round.
The government has indicated that while there must be no 'catch-up' on
public-sector pay after this year's l5 per cent limit, there will be a more
flexible approach next year. The 1.5 per cent rise for this year has been
accepted by workers, with the exception of firefighters, ambulance staff and
rail workers.
Mr Jinkinson said: 'The limit was only accepted this year by most people
because of a unique convergence of low inflation and fear for jobs.'
He added: 'There are plenty of people in Unison who want to show that this
new union of 1.4m people has a lot of muscle.'
A TUC paper on public-sector pay says that many of the sector's 5.7m workers
are suffering falls in real wages as earnings across the economy continue to
rise at about 4 per cent. It warns of a 'devastating effect' on morale and
recruitment in the public sector. Pay settlements have bottomed out but are
still well ahead of inflation, says Incomes Data Services, the research
group.
Latest figures, which incorporate settlements to July, show little change
from the trend that has emerged over the past four to five months, with
private-sector pay increases mostly between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Fuel aid plans rejected: Ministers at a loss over method for
VAT compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are at a loss over how to compensate all those who will need extra
help to take account of value added tax on domestic fuel.
They have rejected every suggestion put forward by Whitehall and told
officials to go back to the drawing board. The compensation package for
people who just miss eligibility for income-related benefits is the key to
making this new tax on household fuel more generally acceptable.
The Liberal Democrats yesterday again sought to exploit the unpopularity of
the policy by insisting that a defeat for the Tories at Christchurch could
mean a change in the plans to extend VAT.
Two opinion polls at the weekend showed Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal
Democrat candidate, on course for a resounding victory in Thursday's
by-election.
No final decision has to be reached on the compensation arrangements until
the annual statement about uprating benefits. But Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, will come under pressure to outline his plans and
give renewed guarantees at the Tory party conference in early October.
Ministers have said there will be compensation for poorer people beyond the
automatic impact of the price increase on the uprating formula, and can see
how to provide help for those on income-related benefits.
But since the move was announced in the Budget, Tory backbenchers have made
clear that there must be a proper compensation scheme for pensioners,
especially those whose savings or income just disqualify them from income
support.
Earlier this month the government's social security advisory committee
estimated that compensating about 8m people for fuel bills once the full
rate of VAT was charged from 1995 would cost about Pounds 720m.
Social security ministers have been looking at possibilities such as raising
the amount of savings that makes someone ineligible for income support,
increasing the age-related premiums, and adapting cold-weather payments.
All have been rejected so far - some because they would be too expensive,
others because they are too complicated. Ministers emphasise, however, that
in spite of the difficulty of targeting people in need of help but not on
income-related benefits, they are determined to find some way of making
extra provision.
Unease in the party is reflected in some of the conference motions put
forward by constituency associations.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Spring warns against N Ireland select committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DICK SPRING, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday warned that the UK
government should not set up a select committee on Northern Ireland.
His comments came amid continuing speculation that the understanding forged
last week between the government and the Ulster Unionist party would lead to
the creation of a cross-party committee of MPs. The party's nine MPs backed
Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the critical Commons votes on the
social chapter, having made clear that they expected changes to restore
'accountable democracy' to Northern Ireland.
Mr Spring said the Irish government had to take notice of the assurances
from Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that
the British government had not reached a deal with the Ulster Unionist
party. He underlined, however, the need to ensure that events at Westminster
over the past few days 'should not cause any further difficulties for
Anglo-Irish relations'.
Mr Spring said: 'At this stage it would be unwise to start addressing this
problem on a bit-by-bit basis. The only way is by bringing about an overall
agreement acceptable to both communities.' He added: 'This will involve
compromise, hard decisions and hard choices. And I don't think anything
should be done in the meantime, like, for example, setting up a select
committee.'
The terms of the understanding between the UUP and the government are
clouded. Both say there has been no formal agreement, but the UUP sees
longer-term benefits from its backing for the government.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist Party leader, last night accused Mr
Spring of an unwarranted interference in the affairs of a sovereign state.
He said: 'If John Major has any integrity at all he must demand that Dick
Spring and the Irish government desist from this intolerable interference.'

FT  26 JUL 93 / St Columbus's salutary lesson for the banks: The growth of
the credit unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BANKS digest last week's opinion poll showing a steady fall in the number
of customers satisfied with their services, they could take a salutary look
at the St Columbus parish in Bradford.
Eighteen months ago, after the main bank in the area closed its branch, the
parish set up a credit union. The union has now taken over the old branch
and is running a service that its 180 members think meets many of the roles
of the bank.
Mr Joseph Yewdall, a voluntary worker at the union and a chairman of the
National Federation of Credit Unions, said: 'There's a lot of people here
who have no access to banks. I think we're showing that there can be an
alternative.'
The St Columbus story is more common than it used to be. After decades of
being regarded as a poor man's social fund, the credit union movement is
growing fast, doubling in number from 203 in 1989 to an estimated 405 last
month.
The UK form of credit union involves up to 5,000 people who have a 'common
bond', such as working for the same employer, forming a savings fund.
Members are usually allowed to borrow up to three times their savings, up to
Pounds 5,000.
Credit unions are not allowed to 'leverage' their funds by lending more than
deposits. In return, and on the assumption that the 'common bond' will make
members wary of defaulting, they do not have to hold capital.
Mr Michael Parkinson, chief executive of the Association of British Credit
Unions, said assets and membership had risen by 40 per cent in the past
year, and the 190 credit unions in his association controlled about Pounds
30m of savings.
The movement is still in its infancy compared with the US and Ireland, where
23 per cent of the population are members. Mr Derek Lee, the registrar of
friendly societies and the unions' regulator, describes it as 'tiny'.
Yet Mr Al Charbonneau, chief executive of the World Council of Credit Unions
in Wisconsin, is impressed by the growth rate.
Nevertheless, he warns that it will be 'many years yet' before Britain's
credit unions are able to offer the wide range of financial services
provided by unions in the US, Canada and Australia - including the issuing
of credit cards.
One reason for the growth lies in the increasing reluctance of banks and
building societies to open their doors to poorer customers - leaving the
unions as almost the only source of cheap loans and savings accounts for
many.
While credit companies such as Provident Financial, which collect weekly,
charge annual percentage rates of interest on loans running into three
figures, credit unions are legally allowed to charge only 1 per cent a month
 -12.7 per cent APR.
At St Columbus union workers said most residents could not get a bank
account. One said: 'Never mind the money, to get a bank account you need a
10-year passport or driving licence - and people around here just haven't
got that.'
The credit union, by contrast, has a relatively open-door policy. Any member
of the local community can join without needing to provide extensive
documents.
Members of the credit union who prove to be reliable are allowed to take
larger loans. Those who save receive an annual dividend, usually about 5 per
cent, calculated by dividing the annual surplus made by the union.
Like most credit unions, St Columbus also offers a bill paying service and,
in conjunction with the local TSB bank, household and life insurance
policies. It is required to invest funds securely under the Credit Unions
Act 1979.
A second reason for growth is the shift in the composition and clientele of
the new unions. Although the movement has been best known for its
'community' based unions, its fastest expansion is in the workplace.
According to Abcu 60 per cent of the movement's assets are held in employee
unions. These range from local government unions to those in the police
force and taxi services. This month British Airways has become the first
private-sector company to establish a union for its 48,000 employees.
Expansion has forced more professionalism on the credit unions, with some of
the larger ones employing full-time staff. But it has also led to growing
demands for new financial powers along the lines of the US unions.
Mr Graham Tomlin, the BA engineering manager who set up the union, wants it
to be able to offer mortgages, cheque books and credit cards. 'I don't see
why we couldn't do that. The demand is definitely there,' he said.
Yet such ambitions may cause some prudential worries about the movement. The
act envisaged unions retaining enough profits to hold reserves equal to 10
per cent of assets, but the figure stands at 7.18 per cent.
In addition, Mr Lee said he was 'disappointed' that the industry had not
responded to pressure to ensure that depositors would not lose all their
savings if a union collapsed.
Officials from the Registry of Friendly Societies are meeting credit union
managers to consider proposals for legal reform. The movement would like
legislative reform to be put to parliament soon.

FT  26 JUL 93 / China worried by spate of air crashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX serious air crashes in less than 12 months have cast a shadow over
China's aviation sector, just as it is seeing a boom in passenger traffic
and a proliferation of new airlines.
Last Friday's accident in which a BAe 146 operated by China Northwest
Airlines ploughed into a lake on take-off seems certain to add to pressures
on authorities to improve safety standards.
The crash killed 55 of the 113 passengers and crew, and many survivors were
badly injured.
The accident at Yinchuan, west of Beijing, happened just days after Mr Jiang
Zhuping, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the country's
regulatory agency, announced the Chinese would freeze approvals for new
airlines because of safety concerns.
From one airline just five years ago, China now boasts at least 35 carriers,
with a number of pending applications. In 1992 passenger traffic grew 33 per
cent and is expected to surge 20 per cent this year.
Since July 1992, when a Soviet-made Yak-42 transport exploded and crashed at
Nanjing airport killing 106 people, China's skies have proved anything but
safe. A spate of aircraft and helicopter crashes have left a death toll of
over 300 and badly tarnished China's air safety record.
The Chinese authorities have not speculated on the cause of Friday's crash
in the Ningxia region, a popular tourist destination because of its
proximity to the Great Wall.
Sensitive to negative publicity, China has sent a senior official, Vice
Premier Zou Jiahua, to the crash site and to the local hospital to visit the
injured.
In London, British Aerospace said the company would send investigators to
the site but had no reason to believe there was any fault with the aircraft.
The BAe 146 was one of a fleet of about 16 delivered to China since the
mid-1960s.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Nigeria's other head of state: Abiola is cultivating his
image as a leader as he plays a wary game with the military ruler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE suppression of Nigeria's election result in June has transformed the
image of Mr Moshood Abiola from business tycoon with a chequered career to
champion of democracy.
President Ibrahim Babangida is an old friend of Mr Abiola, but when he
barred him from becoming the next head of state, it was not intended as a
favour.
However, the country's best known Yoruba has nevertheless achieved a rare
feat in Nigerian politics: he has cut across tribal lines and become a focus
of opposition to military rule even among people who did not vote for him
and who did not expect him to make a good president.
The government's refusal to uphold the June election results has left the
self-proclaimed president-elect as the rallying point for a civilian
population tired of a military regime that, after eight years, seems to have
run out of all ideas except how to stay in power.
Though less fortified than the president's palace in Abuja, Mr Abiola's
house in Lagos is beginning to resemble the home of a head of state. Never a
solitary man, Mr Abiola has been besieged by well-wishers since his
unofficial victory was annulled.
Last Tuesday morning, he and his police escort returned from challenging the
government at the Supreme Court to find the house besieged by groups of
supporters, mainly from his home state of Ogun, near Lagos.
The excited Abiola fans were admitted through massive gates at intervals by
security guards, turned out in smart replicas of the New York police
uniform, right down to badge and truncheon. The impression of a state within
a state continues at the entrance to his large-fronted modern house, where
two gilded thrones are placed, one marked president, the other
vice-president, in honour of Mr Abiola's running mate, Mr Babagana Kingibe.
The first group, women from Ogun state in traditional dress, danced and sang
Yoruba songs outside the house for two hours until Mr Abiola emerged to
acknowledge the adulation.
The women then made way for a larger and even more energetic crowd who also
demanded the presence of their leader, holder of some 200 traditional
chieftancies and former Africa director of the US multinational ITT.
The scene was a mix of traditional and modern, as drummers and dancers,
carrying live fish and other gifts from their villages, shuffled past shiny
new cars and guards with surveillance equipment.
Placards declared: 'Babangida is a pharaoh, end military rule', 'Conspiracy
against Nigerian people', 'International communities save us from
dictatorship' and 'We have elected our president.'
'These days the chief's time is not his own,' said an apologetic assistant,
as Mr Abiola stood on a chair to address an equally large throng inside his
house. By mid-afternoon the crowd, fed and refreshed, began to leave and
their hero looked about to wilt.
'I just want to sleep,' said the Social Democratic party leader as food was
brought for him and 20 or so close friends.
During lunch, when the mobile phone was not ringing, he discussed his
tactics.
Mr Abiola has abandoned passionate rhetoric for measured warnings against
the dangers of violence.
He has dissociated himself from protests earlier this month in support of
his presidency. These were organised in Lagos and other parts of the
south-west by the Campaign for Democracy, but degenerated into a looting
spree until the troops were sent on to the streets, leading to a number of
civilian casualties.
Old charges against Mr Abiola, emanating from official circles, that he made
his fortune dishonestly out of telecommunications contracts, have been
followed since the elections by allegations that as a southerner he does not
represent the nation, and even claims that he is a CIA agent and that he has
already granted the US permission to base a submarine in Nigerian waters.
Mr Abiola has met the president twice since the elections but their
positions remain irreconcilable. He denies that Mr Babangida believes his
own propaganda. 'The problem is that he just doesn't want to give up power.'
But what is his strategy if on August 27 - the target date for handover to
civilian rule - Mr Babangida is still president?
'My role is to give leadership, and that will come in due course,' he said.
He has repeated his stand against violence yet remains equivocal. 'Those who
make peaceful protest through the courts impossible will render violence
inevitable,' he said.
He has also denied that he wants to split Nigeria by declaring himself
president of the south.
Mr Abiola's latest ploy, seeking justice through the courts, always looked a
long shot. In the end the trip to the Supreme Court proved futile because
the government has decreed that the judiciary has no power over the
government's transition programme.
From his seat in Lagos, Mr Abiola's position within his own party is unclear
and the government still retains the support of the armed forces. President
Babangida is said to be a shrewd poker player. Mr Abiola may be wise not to
show his hand until he picks up an ace.

<TEXT>
SEVERAL senior officials of Kenya's central bank are being questioned by
police following a crackdown on corruption launched by Mr Musalia Mudavadi,
the finance minister.
Nairobi newspapers quoted the director of criminal investigations, Mr Noah
arap Too, as saying: 'Investigations are on and a number of those bank
officials are being questioned.'
Following the resignation of the central bank governor, Mr Eric Kotut, on
Friday, Mr Mudavadi announced that 'intensive investigations' were being
conducted within the institution and other local banks. 'Prosecution of all
persons involved in malpractices will follow,' he said.
Mr Kotut was firm in his own defence, denying at the weekend that he had
been responsible for bad management. 'I have never in my entire service been
associated with any malpractice or dishonesty,' he said.
Last Friday, Mr Mudavadi withdrew the licence of Pan African Bank, the
second local bank to be closed within a week. Exchange Bank, alleged to have
been involved in forgery of export receipts to claim export rebates from the
government, was shut last Tuesday. It is contesting the order.
Mr Mudavadi said the government would seek to recover interest owed to the
central bank relating to interbank transactions and defaults in foreign
exchange operations.
The minister's efforts to clean up the financial system strikes at the heart
of Kenya's system of political patronage.
International Monetary Fund officials, who have visited Kenya four times in
as many months, have insisted that action be taken as a pre-condition for
the resumption of balance of payments assistance, suspended in November
1991.

SHARES on the Karachi Stock Exchange yesterday recorded their highest rise

index rose 44.63 to close at 1399.68.
The surge came amid expectations that last Thursday's devaluation of the
rupee would improve textile profits by boosting exports. Almost a third of
the 652 companies on the KSE are in textiles, which have suffered heavy
losses over the past year.
The market was also lifted by confidence in Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former vice
president of the World Bank who became interim prime minister a week ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party,
took his campaign for regional autonomy to new heights yesterday in an
attempt to influence democracy negotiators who will today begin debating the
first draft of a new constitution for South Africa.
He told a traditional gathering of tens of thousands of Zulus in
Johannesburg that the African National Congress and the ruling National
party aimed to destroy the Zulu kingdom, whose modern manifestation is the
KwaZulu black homeland which he leads.
'How long can we be expected to give our blessings to the connivance which
is obviously directed at obliterating the Zulu nation, both politically and
physically from the South African map,' he asked the crowd, many of whom
carried spears and clubs, and performed tribal dances.
The key issue of the powers to be granted to regional governments under a
new constitution is likely to be the focus of today's debate, during which
South Africans will get their first glimpse of a draft new constitution
drawn up by technical experts.
The draft is of an interim constitution to be in force until an elected
constituent assembly writes a final one.
It was not clear yesterday whether Inkatha would be present for the debate.
Inkatha, KwaZulu's government and the Conservatives walked out of the
negotiations on July 2 after 19 of the 26 participants agreed by 'sufficient
consensus' to set April 27 as the date for the first multi-racial elections.
They insist that consensus on such a vital issue ought not to have been
reached without them, and Inkatha has said 'sufficient consensus' must be
redefined to require its assent on issues of vital interest.
It has made clear that it will continue to participate in bilateral
discussions on constitutional issues but the Conservatives have given no
such assurance.
Democracy negotiators have made substantial concessions to Chief Buthelezi
on regional autonomy, but his demand that KwaZulu lose none of its current
powers until a new regional constitution is in place may be hard for
negotiators to swallow.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Ten killed at church in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACK assailants armed with an automatic rifle and hand grenades burst into
a white suburban church service in Cape Town last night, killing 10
worshippers including four visiting Russian seamen, Agencies report.
The attack on the church in suburban Kenilworth was the deadliest so far
this year in a series that have targeted white civilians.
Witnesses said a hooded gunman burst through a side door of the church
during the evening service and opened fire with an automatic rifle. Another
man lobbed two grenades into the church, pitching one among about 130
Russian seamen brought to the church by a mission group.
'It was an absolute horror,' Mr Trevor Adams, one of the worshippers, said.
'People were screaming and crying.'
The multi-denominational church was filled with more than 1,000 people,
including Russian sailors who regularly attend services when in port. In
addition to those killed, nearly 50 were injured, including some Russians.
President F W de Klerk expressed outrage at the attack, saying it pointed to
the need for a political resolution of South Africa's tensions.
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the massacre was the 'most foul,
despicable thing imaginable'.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. The
government has accused the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and its
armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, of previous attacks on
whites.
The PAC draws support from radical black township youth and has refused to
follow the lead of Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and suspend
its armed struggle.
Politically motivated attacks against white civilians were extremely rare
until late last year. But there have been at least a half-dozen since last
November, leaving more than 20 whites dead.
The PAC president, Mr Clarence Mawketu, said last month the guerrillas would
continue to target white civilians and the security forces.

The market was also lifted by confidence in Mr Moeen Qureshi, a former vice

He is expected to negotiate new loans worth Dollars 2.5bn from a consortium
at a Paris meeting in September and a Dollars 1bn loan from the IMF under
the extended structural adjustment facility.
Mr Amin Umer, a KSE broker, said he expected the momentum to continue. Other
brokers echoed this, forecasting that bullish sentiment could continue until
the run-up to the October elections.
Before leaving for Washington yesterday, Mr Qureshi denied reports that
Pakistan was seeking a moratorium on its Dollars 18.5bn foreign debt. He
also denied that foreign exchange reserves had fallen sharply. 'In the last
few days, foreign exchange reserves have risen significantly,' he said,
without giving a figure.
A donor consortium meeting in April was called off by Pakistan after Mr
Nawaz Sharif's government was sacked, amid fears that donors would not make
fresh commitments because of concern over reversal of economic reforms.
But Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, and Mr Sharif, the main
contenders in the election, favour similar policies of free market reforms.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Seeking security in S E Asia: Victor Mallet examines Asean's
plans to bring great powers closer to its members' political concerns in a
post-Cold War world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH-EAST Asian countries have formally announced plans to bring together
the US, China and Russia in an 18-member forum, to discuss political and
security issues in Asia and the Pacific. This would be the first group of
its kind in the region.
Foreign ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean)
said in Singapore, at the end of their annual meeting, that the first
gathering of the new Asean Regional Forum would be held alongside Asean's
talks in Bangkok next year.
One reason for the new forum is the uncertainty after the Cold War and the
withdrawal of US forces from the Philippines. Several Asian countries have
embarked on weapon-buying programmes, often taking advantage of bargain
prices in the former Soviet Union.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, was lukewarm towards the idea
of formal multilateral security talks when he arrived in Singapore on
Saturday for discussions with his Asian counterparts.
'These dialogues will build upon, but will not supplant, our alliances and
our forward military presence,' he told reporters. 'We are not reducing our
forces in the region. We are in fact making them more effective.'
Those expected to participate in the first formal round of security talks,
in Bangkok next year, are the Asean states (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), Asean's regular 'dialogue partners'
(the US, the EC, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Korea), as
well as China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea.
Western and Asian diplomats say the participants will probably find common
ground on such issues as piracy and maritime surveillance, but be more
reluctant to agree to a regional arms register, to exchange information
about their defence plans, or to adopt Asean proposals for a zone free of
nuclear weapons.
The confrontation of China against Vietnam and Asean, over the disputed
Spratly islands in the South China Sea, is one issue to be tackled in the
security talks.
Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, dismissed the 'China threat' in a
speech to foreign correspondents in Singapore at the weekend: 'China does
not, and will not, impose hegemony and power politics on others and will not
threaten or bully anyone.'
He described reports of a Chinese military build-up as 'rather fabricated'
and said an airport built on the Paracel islands north of the Spratlys in
1988 was 'to improve transport' and had nothing to do with military
preparations.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, echoed the US administration's
talk of a 'new Pacific community' when he said his government saw Asia and
the Pacific 'developing into a sort of regional security community capable
of efficient peace-keeping in accordance with the UN charter.'
Aware that south-east Asian leaders are concerned at the possibility of
China basing Russian bombers in the South China Sea, Mr Kozyrev gave
assurances that Russia would not sell to Asian countries 'purely offensive'
weapons such as long-range bombers. 'From now on, the main symbols of our
presence here will be freighters instead of missile cruisers and joint
ventures instead of nuclear submarines.'
Mr Christopher had his first encounter as Secretary of State with Mr Qian
yesterday. He spent much of the 80-minute meeting on M-11 missile parts
which, US officials say, China has sent to Pakistan. 'We intend to continue
to pursue this question very seriously,' a senior US official said.
The two men also discussed US proposals for a comprehensive ban on testing
nuclear weapons, and the problem of Chinese citizens being smuggled into the
US by ship as illegal immigrants.
Prompted by the mainly Moslem governments of Malaysia and Indonesia, Asean
said that Bosnia-Hercegovina should be exempted from the UN weapons embargo
on the former Yugoslavia.

inches from the record crest of 47 feet reached last week on the St Louis
flood gauge - three feet above the level reached in 1973, the year of the
last great flood to hit the region.
But the new rains are forecast to produce yet another record, at 48 feet,
this weekend, threatening far greater damage. Besides overflowing some earth
levees that barely withstood the last crest, the Mississippi is also
expected to break through more levees weakened by weeks of waterlogging.
Tributaries such as the Missouri, Illinois, Des Moines, Kansas and Platte
rivers have also flooded and are wreaking havoc in parts of eight states.
Government estimates of the damage caused by the flooding have now topped
Dollars 10bn, much of it to farmers who have been unable to plant in
rainsoaked ground, even when it is not under water.
Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, said yesterday that the administration,
which last week asked Congress for Dollars 2.48bn in flood aid, would now
ask for Dollars 5bn. The flood bill was held up in the House of
Representatives last week after a dispute over whether it should be added to
the deficit or met by offsetting spending cuts. It is expected to pass this
week.
Meanwhile, drought in south-eastern states may be more damaging to US
agriculture because this affects a wider area than the flooding in the
Midwest.
Flood deaths in the Midwest, however, could now start to climb because flash
floods can be triggered by as little as two inches of rain, let alone the
7-10 inch downpours that some parts of the region have suffered during the
last week.

BRAZIL is coming under international pressure to act against the country's
urban death squads, after the murder of seven homeless boys and young men in
the centre of Rio de Janeiro.
Those who died, aged 11 to 22, were among a group of 40 youngsters sleeping
outside the Candelaria church who were sprayed with gunfire by men in cars
at dawn on Friday.
The gunmen are widely believed to be police, though initial witness reports
identifying two policemen have been withdrawn. Yesterday, a member of the
task force set up to investigate the crime said that it believed the
massacre to be the work of 'professional exterminators', adding that
inquiries are now focusing on security guards of banks and shops in the
Candelaria area. Even so, police involvement has not been ruled out.
According to official figures, 320 street children were killed in Rio during
the first six months of this year by death squads. These are said to receive
pay from hoteliers and shopkeepers for so-called 'clean-up operations'.
Their members often include police.
Organisations such as Amnesty International have offered much criticism but
the Brazilian government has done nothing to lessen the poverty forcing
children into the streets, to halt the killings or to undo Brazil's
reputation as a country of impunity. However, the latest attack was
especially shocking in its blatancy and the government may be forced to act.
A European Community communique on Saturday condemned the attack, expressing
'profound indignation by member states'.
President Itamar Franco spent the weekend in Rio conferring with Mr Mauricio
Correia, justice minister, and Governor Leonel Brizola of Rio. Mr Franco's
spokesman says the president was 'horrified'.

FT  26 JUL 93 / US taxation legislator denies allegations of postal
embezzlement

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAN Rostenkowski, the most powerful tax legislator in the US Congress,
broke his silence this weekend to defend himself against allegations of
embezzlement.
He had made no comment all week after Mr Robert Rota, former head of the
post office at the House of Representatives, pleaded guilty to charges of
helping two congressmen to embezzle money through his office.
Mr Rota identified only Congressmen A and B in his plea, but the dates and
amounts of payments listed in documents filed with the court match payments
made to Mr Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat, and to Mr Joe Kolter, a
Pennsylvania Democrat, these being detailed in earlier public documents.
On Saturday, however, Mr Rostenkowski hired new lawyers to defend himself
and called a news conference on Capitol Hill to deny 'the many unfair, false
and baseless allegations that have been made recently about me.'
Mr Rostenkowski went on: 'I am presumed to be innocent. I have been charged
with nothing. But, most importantly, I am in fact innocent of any
wrongdoing.'
Mr Robert Bennett, who will now handle Mr Rostenkowski's defence in tandem
with Mr Carl Rauh, has defended clients such as Mr Casper Weinberger, former
defence secretary, and Mr Robert Altman, now on trial in New York in the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International case.
As chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, Mr Rostenkowski holds
sway over all tax legislation in Congress. He and Senator Pat Moynihan,
chairman of the Senate finance committee, are the key negotiators in the
effort to craft a bill that would reconcile the different budgets recently
passed by the House and the Senate.
Mr Rostenkowski is one of the very few powerful Democrats in Comgress who
has shown any willingness to help President Bill Clinton get his economic
programme passed.
The chairman is leading the search for a compromise on energy taxation that
would take into account the Senate's rejection of a broad tax levied on the
thermal content of all forms of energy, but would raise more money than the
simple petrol tax of 4.3 cents a gallon voted by the Senate.
Having failed to win Senate negotiators over to the idea of adding a
utilities tax to the petrol tax, Mr Rostenkowski is now proposing to lift
the petrol tax in stages to 9 cents a gallon. Congressional aides expect a
final agreement at 6 to 7 cents a gallon; White House officials appear to
have accepted that.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Cuban telephone links eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US State Department has issued new guidelines for telecommunications
companies seeking to provide telephone links to Cuba, opening a small,
symbolic breach in the US trade embargo against the government of President
Fidel Castro, reports George Graham in Washington.
The new rules do not release Cuba's estimated Dollars 80m share of earlier
telecommunications revenues, frozen in an escrow account in New York, but
they allow Cuba to receive half of future telephone revenues.
Cuban exiles are allowed to make small remittances to relatives in Cuba, but
other dollar transfers to the island are banned by the US.
The relaxation of rules for telephone services was authorised by US
legislation last year that otherwise sought to tighten the US embargo
against Cuba by extending restrictions to the foreign subsidiaries of US
companies. This was hotly contested by foreign countries, including the UK,
as an unwarranted extension of US jurisdiction.
Cuban exiles in the US, including those who otherwise oppose any thaw in
relations with the Castro government, strongly favour improved telephone
links.
Telephone links with Cuba have always been difficult, but became even more
so after Hurricane Andrew last year knocked out AT&amp;T's transmission towers
in south Florida.
It is not clear whether Cuba, which has insisted on receiving its money from
escrow, will accept the proposal, but its increasingly desperate need for
foreign exchange may well cause it to settle for the offer under the new
rules.

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) has reached a messy,
last-minute compromise on the future of a controversial Malaysian plan to
establish an east Asian trade group excluding the US and Australia, writes
Victor Mallet from Singapore.
Asean's six foreign ministers agreed that the proposed East Asia Economic
Caucus (Eaec) would be within the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
forum - the broader organisation which does include the US, Australia and
Japan - but would also be able to meet outside the context of the Apec.
A dispute over the relative merits of the Eaec and Apec has soured relations
between Malaysia and Indonesia, and between Asean and the US.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, has argued that the Apec will
be dominated by the US, and he differed from his Asean colleagues by bluntly
refusing to attend an Apec summit planned by President Bill Clinton in
November.
The US has opposed the Eaec, and persuaded Japan and South Korea not to
join, on the grounds that it could become a protectionist trading bloc.
Japan, which has said that it cannot make a decision on the EAEC until Asean
has reached a consensus, will now face pressure from Malaysia to join the
caucus.
The Asean compromise, however, is a confused one, since it suggests both
that the Eaec will have an independent existence, guided by Asean economic
ministers (the Malaysian position), and that the Eaec will simply be a
caucus within Apec (the Indonesian position).
Mr Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, welcomed the Asean compromise
in that it 'recognises the primacy of the Apec'.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Francis Bouygues - concrete king: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANCIS BOUYGUES, one of France's most powerful industrialists and
founder of Bouygues, the world's largest construction company, died at the
weekend of a heart attack at his country home in Brittany.
Known in France as the 'concrete king', Mr Bouygues, 70, was a figure noted
as much for his powerful personality as his business skills. He was one of
the handful of autocratic industrialists, or patrons, who dominated the
industrial development of post-war France.
The prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, described him at the weekend as a
'man of remarkable intelligence, dynamism and imagination'. Mr Jacques
Chirac, mayor of Paris and prospective president, praised his 'imagination,
creativity and tenacity'.
Mr Bouygues was born in Paris in 1922 and, after studying engineering,
founded Bouygues in 1952. The company flourished during the buoyant post-war
era and, helped by Mr Bouygues' political contacts, became a power in the
construction industry. However, he also had the vision to expand the
business internationally. This strategy has been continued by his son,
Martin, who took over as chairman in 1989.
Bouygues has made its mark with a series of grandiose projects both inside
and outside France, including the construction of Charles de Gaulle airport
near Paris and the futuristic Grande Arche at La Defense, as well as being a
big contractor for the Channel Tunnel.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Hauliers' strike threat to Italy food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPLIES of essential materials including foodstuffs and petrol were
threatened yesterday by the onset of a two-week strike of Italy's
independent road hauliers.
Talks between the government and Unatras, the independent road hauliers'
association, are due to continue today to find a compromise, but the two
sides remain far apart.
The strike threatens devastating disruption at a time of political
uncertainty. Road haulage accounts for 62 per cent of all freight in Italy
and Unatras members carry roughly two thirds of this.
Already yesterday anxious motorists had exhausted supplies of petrol in many
of the major cities.
This is the Ciampi government's first serious challenge from a trade
organisation. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, has adopted a
tough stance towards what he regards as excessive demands from Unatras at a
moment when unions and management have agreed to keep wage demands below
inflation.
If necessary, the government says it has prepared emergency measures for
essential distribution and could invoke legislation forcing Unatras members
back to work. However, matters could be complicated if road hauliers decide
to block main roads as some have threatened.
The strike has been the result of a dispute over new tariffs and fiscal
treatment dating back to last year.
The association is demanding a 10 per cent increase in tariffs. The
government is offering 2 per cent for 1993 and 3 per cent for 1994.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Banks meet over Ferruzzi debts: Smaller foreign banks
nervous about suicide of Gardini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN banks owed L6,500bn (Pounds 2.72bn) in the collapse of the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group are due to attend a creditors' meeting in Milan
tomorrow under the auspices of the Bank of Italy.
The meeting has been called by Mediobanca which is co-ordinating the rescue
operation through five Italian and two foreign banks. By holding the session
at the Milan offices of the Bank of Italy, Mediobanca has aimed to give a
sense of neutrality while also demonstrating the central bank's commitment
to the orderly resolution of the problems created by Ferruzzi's L31,000bn
consolidated debt.
But the meeting has been complicated by the extraordinary string of recent
events affecting the leading players in Italy's second largest private group
and the state of Ferruzzi-Montedison's finances.
As a result, some of the smaller foreign banks may well be tempted to invoke
proceedings for default. Until now the two foreign banks on the rescue
committee, Switzerland's UBS and France's Societe Generale, have not raised
the issue.
The foreign banks, however, have been made nervous by the shock-waves
following the suicide by Mr Raul Gardini, the former head of the Ferruzzi
empire, and by arrest warrants issued for four key figures connected with
the group on charges including alleged falsifying accounts and illicit
financing of political parties.
It is now certain, according to Milan magistrates, that Mr Gardini would
have been arrested on similar charges had he not committed suicide.
Mr Carlo Sama, married to one of the three sisters of the empire's founder
the late Arturo Ferruzzi, and former chief executive of Montedison, the
group's chemicals arm, is now in prison on charges of alleged falsifying
accounts and corruption. Mr Vittorio Giuliani Ricci, married to another of
Arturo Ferruzzi's daughters, and a leading group executive, has been
released on bail.
The late Mr Gardini's close associate, Mr Sergio Cusani, a financier close
to the Socialist Party, was also arrested on corruption charges allegedly
related to the creation of a L100bn slush fund resulting from
Ferruzzi-Montedison's involvement in the reorganisation of the chemicals
industry.
Over the weekend Mr Giuseppe Berlini, the Ferruzzi family's private
financier, handed himself in to Milan magistrates after an arrest warrant
was issued for alleged corruption'
These arrests, coupled with the continued interrogation of Mr Giuseppe
Garofano, the former chief executive of Montedison, have already begun to
shed light on some of the reasons behind Ferruzzi's huge debts and losses.
Evidence has emerged that goes some way to explain the mysterious
announcement on June 28 that Montedison had lost an extra L320bn in 1992
only days after shareholders had approved the year's accounts.
According to extracts of Mr Garofano's testimony due to be published today
by Il Mondo, a weekly magazine, these losses relate directly to commodity
trading deals conducted by Mr Gardini. To cover commodities trading losses
of Dollars 60m-Dollars 80m (Pounds 40m-Pounds 53m), Mr Gardini decided to
speculate in soya in 1989. This was already public knowledge since the
Chicago Board of Trade subsequently imposed a Dollars 2m fine on the
Ferruzzi group.
However, according to Mr Garofano's testimony, Mr Gardini lost Dollars
350m-Dollars 400m. Of this only Dollars 150m was written into the accounts
of Ferruzzi Finanzaria (Ferfin) in 1990 and the remainder was temporarily
covered by Montedison arranging a back-to-back financial operation with
Montedison International, allegedly using the services of Mr Berlini.
The Garofano testimony goes on to allege that the extra L320bn hole in
Montedison's 1992 accounts was due to the Ferruzzi family seeking to cover
the bulk of the commodities losses caused by the days of the Gardini
chairmanship by attributing them to Montedison.

MR Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, has
restated his support for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's
production director, despite mounting evidence to support industrial spying
allegations against him.
The statement from Mr Schroder, followed a hurriedly called meeting on
Friday with Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman.
The state's 20 per cent stake lost an estimated DM300m (Pounds 116m) of its
value last week as legal setbacks lopped 7 per cent off VW shares.
It has since emerged that Mr Lopez, linked last Thursday by state
prosecutors with one batch of confidential documents belonging to General
Motors, his former employer, and found in a Wiesbaden house, had personally
collected some of the others.
In early February, more than a month before he abruptly joined VW, he
visited Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, from his Detroit base, to attend
meetings called at his request. On February 3 and 4, during the
presentations, he asked managers from the group's European subsidiaries for
papers on purchasing, cost and new model strategies.
Some of these later turned up in four boxes in the former Wiesbaden home of
two of his Opel colleagues, who followed him to VW.
On the afternoon of February 4, a call was made from his office near
Frankfurt to Wolfsburg, the VW headquarters. Whom he called is not clear,
but according to an extract from his office diary for that day, reproduced
in today's edition of the news magazine Der Spiegel, Mr Lopez had noted:
'14pm Jens Neu'.
The magazine suggested this could have referred to a meeting with Mr Jens
Neumann, the VW director responsible for group strategy.
However, the distances involved suggest a meeting was unlikely. The next
day, when Mr Lopez was to attend talks in Zurich at GM Europe, he cancelled
all appointments and turned up unexpectedly at Eisenach in eastern Germany,
Opel's newest car factory, and asked for documents on the plant's lean
production systems. On February 6, he called Wolfsburg again.
Public prosecutors investigating GM's suspicions of espionage last week
stated that transparencies also found in the boxes, and regarded as
confidential by GM, had also been expressly requested and translated into
German by Mr Lopez.
Der Spiegel, which last week was freed from a reporting gag on the case
imposed through a temporary injunction granted to VW last month, yesterday
quoted a senior VW employee as saying the prosecutors' statement sparked
'blind panic' in Wolfsburg.
It also claimed an eye-witness had seen Mr Lopez's associates, Mr Jorge
Alvarez Aguirre, and Mr Rosario Piazza, using two shredding machines in the
house. Asked what they were doing, Mr Alvarez is said to have replied: 'We
are destroying some General Motors documents.'
The shredding took place after the two had quit Opel.
VW could not be reached for comment yesterday.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Bundesbank will not follow the Fed's lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICA'S money markets barely flinched in response to last week's
congressional testimony by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. His
Humphrey-Hawkins report gave few new clues about when interest rates might
rise, and long-term rates hardly moved.
What was new, and potentially important, was Mr Greenspan's emphasis on
real, inflation-adjusted, interest rates as an indicator of inflationary
pressures. According to the Fed, the relationship between monetary
aggregates, inflation and output appears to have broken down. It fears that
slow growth in its favoured M2 broad money indicator may paint an overly
sanguine picture of future inflationary trends.
But Mr Greenspan did not explain how real interest rates will fill the gap.
Real rates, he said, should not move too far from the long-term 'equilibrium
rate' consistent with steady non-inflationary growth. He also noted that
short-term rates, deflated by post consumer price inflation, have been close
to zero for nine months, as the left-hand chart shows. But does this mean
that short-term real rates are currently too low? And what is their long-run
equilibrium level? Mr Greenspan left the markets guessing.
Europe's money markets are, meanwhile, having similar difficulties guessing
when the Bundesbank's next interest rate cut will arrive. Current parities
in the exchange rate mechanism may not survive much longer without a
substantial cut in German rates. The troubled state of German manufacturing
industry, and an inverted yield curve, both argue for lower rates. But last
week's news that German broad money grew by an annualised and seasonally
adjusted rate of 7.1 per cent in June, taking it outside the bank's target
range of 4.5-6.5 per cent for 1993, appears, for now, to rule out further
cuts.
The Bundesbank, unlike the Fed, has not publicly suggested that the
relationship between broad money and inflation has broken down. Nor should
it, according to Mr Thomas Mayer of Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. Mr Mayer has
re-estimated the Bundesbank's own monetary model to test the sagacity of its
monetarist policy rules. He finds that, despite the monetary turbulence that
has engulfed Germany since monetary unification in July 1990, the bank's old
policy rule still holds: a one percentage point increase in money supply
above that justified by long-run growth still leads to a one percentage
point rise in the price level. Even if broad money growth falls to 6.5 per
cent this year and 6 per cent in 1994, inflation will remain well above 3
per cent throughout next year, despite the bank's 2 1/2 per cent target.
So should the Bundesbank ignore industry's complaints and raise interest
rates, rather than cut them? The bank's problem is that it is battling to
control aggregate inflation in an economy in which the non-traded and traded
sectors are moving in very different directions. Monetary growth is
accelerating because the government is borrowing from the banks to finance
its budget deficit. High interest rates and harsh words from the Bundesbank
have failed to stop this public profligacy, which in turn is fuelling
non-traded price inflation: consumer prices rose, over the past year, by
over 4 per cent.
The Bundesbank's only option, short of abandoning its inflation objective,
has therefore been to use high interest rates and a strong D-Mark to enforce
a fierce offsetting credit squeeze on private industry. Not surprisingly,
producer prices fell by 0.4 per cent in the year to June.
Mr Greenspan's short-term real interest rates provide a powerful
illustration of the Bundesbank's dilemma. The short-term real rate, based on
consumer price inflation, has dropped sharply this year, as the right-hand
charts shows. But the relevant real interest rate for industry - adjusted
for producer price inflation - has barely fallen. If the Bundesbank cares
about traded goods price inflation and the long-term health of German
industry, then it should relieve its suffering by cutting interest rates
now. But if the bank still believes in its monetarist analysis then it is
hard to see how it can credibly do so.

<TEXT>
A BOMB injured three foreign tourists and a Turk at a tourist site in
central Istanbul, yesterday, agencies report.
It was not immediately clear whether the blast was connected with threats by
the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to attack Turkish tourist
sites. But it coincided with other violence blamed on the PKK.
Armed PKK rebels meanwhile kidnapped four French tourists from a bus in
south-eastern Turkey.
In another incident, a mine planted on a railway exploded near the town of
Bingol, derailing a passenger train. Two soldiers protecting the train were
killed and three other people on board were injured. Officials blamed the
PKK for the attack.
Police said the Istanbul bomb had been left in a litter basket under an
automated bank teller machine near the sixth-century Haghia Sophia
Cathedral.
The tourists, two of them Italians, and the Turk were all slightly injured.
No damage was reported to the Haghia Sophia, one of the world's most
celebrated monuments of Byzantine architecture.

<TEXT>
AZERBAIJAN and the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have agreed a three-day
ceasefire along the borders of the disputed enclave, the latest in a series
of attempts to end the bloody fighting, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Gegam Bagdasaryan, a Karabakh parliament spokesman, said the ceasefire,
which took effect at midnight on Saturday, had so far been respected by both
sides.
'We agreed on condition that the time would be used to hold top-level
negotiations between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh,' he said.
Azeri authorities refused to confirm or deny whether a ceasefire had been
introduced, but a defence ministry spokesman in the Azeri capital, Baku,
told local reporters that the fighting had effectively stopped yesterday.
Interfax news agency said the ceasefire was agreed after a series of
consultations between Mr Safar Abiyev, Azeri acting defence minister, and Mr
Samvel Babayan, Karabakh military commander.
Armenian forces this year changed the tide of the five-year war over the
Transcaucasian enclave, which has announced its independence from
Azerbaijan. Repeated international and domestic efforts to resolve the
crisis have come to nothing.
The Armenians have forced Azeri troops out of Karabakh and seized a crucial
region between the enclave and Armenia. Last week, they dealt Baku a further
humiliating blow when they seized the key Azeri town of Agdam, east of
Karabakh, despite repeated denials that they intended to gain control of the
town.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Throwback to Soviet ways: John Lloyd examines the weekend
announcement by the Russian Central Bank that all pre-1993 roubles are to be
scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement over the weekend, by the Russian Central Bank, that all
roubles printed before 1993 must be exchanged during the next two weeks for
new notes is confusing only on the surface. Below the surface, it is
Byzantine.
First, the timing of the announcement was significant. It came early on
Saturday morning, when President Boris Yeltsin was on holiday, when Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the finance minister, was in the US.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, his first deputy, had just left for a summer break -
having told journalists on Friday that the government would demand that Mr
Yeltsin must veto a range of measures passed by the parliament in the
previous week.
No government figure commented on the announcement, as would have been
expected with regard to a move at once so radical and so uncomfortable for
the population.
Instead, the official Tass news agency published a Statement of the Russian
Government: Text of the Official Document, which says, 'the Central Bank's
decision, taken with the aim of stabilising the cash circulation in the
country and eliminating the plurality of forms of cash notes, is supported
by the Russian Government'. (This was without citing a spokesman or minister
 -a throwback to the Soviet period when announcements simply emanated from
the communist party politburo from the government.)
Second, according to a source close to the radicals in the Russian cabinet,
two key reformers - Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, and Mr
Andrei Vavilov, the deputy finance minister - had a series of meetings with
Mr Yeltsin yesterday and finally secured his agreement to issue a decree
cancelling the decision of the Central Bank and sacking Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman.
The reformers were horrified by the move, regarding it as a provocation
designed to deepen the government's unpopularity, taken without notice or
adequate preparation, and largely useless in combatting inflation and crime,
two of the stated aims.
However, no such decree had been published by yesterday evening. Mr Yeltsin
is constitutionally unable to sack Mr Gerashchenko without the agreement of
the Russian parliament, to which the central bank chairman is responsible.
If the president were to decree such a dismissal, he would be again be in
direct confrontation with the parliament.
Third, a clash between the president and the executive, on the one side, and
the parliament, on the other, is now inevitable. It will probably come soon.
The parliament has taken a range of decisions in the past ten days:
To strip the privatisation agency of many of its powers to rescind licences
given to foreign banks;
To tighten control over the Central Bank itself;
To pass a budget with a deficit of Rbs22,000bn (Pounds 14.3bn), or 25 per
cent of GNP;
To give leave to the procurator-general to investigate corruption
allegations against Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister.
(A parallel investigation is proceeding against Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a
deputy prime minister and, like Mr Shumeiko, a close ally of Mr Yeltsin.)
These have added up to the most serious challenge to the president since he
was forced by the Congress of People's Deputies last december to fire Mr
Yegor Gaidar, then the acting prime minister.
Mr Yeltsin has thus cut short a planned two-week break by some four or five
days, and he was at his desk in the Kremlin yesterday.
Fourth, the political temperature is rising rapidly. A congress of the
National Salvation Front, the hard-line grouping that unites the nationalist
and neo-communist movements, met yesterday to hear its co-chairman, Mr Ilya
Constantinov, demand that 'this criminal government be swept away'.
The deepening involvement of Russian troops in the Asian border war between
Tadjikistan and Afghanistan is raising passions as the number of casualties
rises; the worsening relations between Estonians and Russians in the Baltic
republic of Estonia is a prime cause for the nationalists in Russia to
seize, as is the decision of the Russian parliament to claim jurisdiction
over the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, a region of Ukraine.
Mr Yeltsin was told by the supportive daily newspaper Izvestiya last Friday
that 'the President's voice must now be heard'. It seems that such a hearing
cannot be long delayed.

SERB forces fired artillery rounds into a French-staffed United Nations base
in Sarajevo yesterday, setting ablaze several vehicles but with no reported
injuries. The incident occurred hours after the latest Bosnian ceasefire
came into force.
French Colonel Roger Duburg said 68 artillery rounds had slammed into the
parking lot of the UN base, in what he told reporters was a deliberate
attempt to intimidate the UN. The shells hit a satellite base of the UN
force at the Zetra Olympic stadium in the besieged Bosnian capital.
'I believe this was a signal. Under the latest UN resolution we may have the
option to send them a signal,' Col Duburg said, implying that the UN forces
could retaliate.
'This was direct fire. It was not an accident.' he said. The UN has warned
Serb forces it will use Nato aircraft to protect UN peacekeepers if they
come under fire in the six enclaves proclaimed as 'safe areas', including
Sarajevo.
UN Commander Barry Frewer said both sides had ignored the ceasefire. Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic has said he would boycott peace talks in Geneva,
postponed until Tuesday, if the Serbs maintain their offensive.
Bosnian radio said at least 27 people were killed and 60 wounded yesterday
in an all-out Serb tank and artillery attack on the northeastern town of
Brcko.
UN observers saw refugees streaming from the town, headed for Tuzla, the
Bosnian government stronghold 40 miles to the south. The UN reports said
they expected the fighting to intensify amid a build-up of Serbian tanks.
'The entire 65km front line is wrapped in flames and smoke. . . Bosnian
homes are collapsing like houses of cards in the terrible explosions of
Russian Volkov rockets,' said Sarajevo radio, calling yesterday 'the most
difficult since the beginning of the war'.
Belgrade radio confirmed the clashes between Serbs, on one side, and Moslems
and Croats, on the other. It said a powerful counter-offensive has
successfully pushed back the Moslem forces'. Serb forces seized control of
Lipovac, Kolonija and Brod, villages on the outskirts of Brcko, reported
SRNA, the Bosnian Serb news agency.
Brcko has changed hands several times and been heavily damaged since the war
erupted 16 months ago.
The five-day offensive around Brcko follows a pattern established by the
Bosnian Serb army in spring last year when they killed or expelled hundreds
of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia while international attention
was focused on Sarajevo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries clashed at
the weekend over ways to support sagging world oil prices.
Mr Jean Ping, Gabon's oil minister and current president of Opec, has failed
to find a consensus to address what one minister described as 'Opec's worst
crisis since the price collapse of 1986'.
Mr Ping continued his tour of Middle Eastern Opec countries to canvass
opinion for an emergency meeting to agree a strategy for Opec when Iraq
returns to the export market.
Iraqi officials have been involved in negotiations with the United Nations
over limited oil sales.
Mr Ping met officials from the United Arab Emirates, the organisation's
fourth biggest producer, yesterday afternoon.
He said in Abu Dhabi that he might hold further talks today with Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait. His shuttle, which has already included discussions with
the Saudi, Iranian and Kuwaiti oil ministers, was prompted by oil market
jitters over the prospect of Iraq reaching agreement with the United Nations
on a limited exemption to the oil embargo imposed after the Gulf war.
Opec has already abandoned plans for an emergency meeting scheduled for
Wednesday in Vienna in the absence of any agreement and amid increasing
recriminations among its leading members.
In particular, Saudi Arabia and Iran, the organisation's two biggest
producers, are at loggerheads over the course the organisation should take.
Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, is seeking an immediate
meeting, with the backing of Algeria.
But Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, has argued that a meeting would be
pointless until it is known if, when and in what quantities Iraqi oil will
return to the market.
Although Opec, with the exception of Kuwait, agreed at its last meeting to
adhere to an overall ceiling of 23.58m barrels a day, industry estimates put
actual production well above 24m b/d.
Mr Nazer on Friday placed the blame squarely on Iran for the present price
slump, accusing Tehran of pumping 277,000 b/d more than its alloted share
under the last agreement. Iran 'alone bears responsibility', he said. Iraq
yesterday joined the fray, blaming the ruling families of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait for undercutting prices.
The oil market was fairly steady late last week in spite of the Opec
disarray, but price stability remains fragile while the threat of Iraqi oil
sales continues to hang over the market.
Iraqi officials who have been talking to the United Nations about a possible
one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil are still in Baghdad. But they
are expected to resume talks in New York next week.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Violence still setting Mideast agenda: Roger Matthews
assesses the latest blow to a failing peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S extensive air raids and artillery bombardment of Lebanon yesterday
again underlined just how narrow the line is between war and peace in the
Middle East. Since October 1991, when the Middle East peace conference
convened in Madrid, the main issue in the region has been the unique
opportunity that existed for a settlement.
But, after 10 rounds of negotiations, it is still violence and the response
to it that are setting the agenda. Lebanon's southern border with Israel is
where the failures of the peace process are most easily exploited by those
most opposed to it. Since its unsuccessful attempts in 1978 and 1982 to
impose itself on Lebanon politically, Israel has occupied part of the south,
purportedly to protect its territory from rocket attacks. But the occupation
invites retaliation, provides a focus for the rivalry between Syria and
Israel for influence in Lebanon, and has opened the door to the involvement
of Iran through Hizbollah, the radical Shia movement which it largely
finances.
Hizbollah serves several purposes. It can claim to be acting as a national
liberation movement, has a legitimate role in Lebanese political life, but
can also reflect the interests of Syria and Iran, at least for as long as
the aims of those two countries coincide. It is a measure of Hizbollah's
importance to Iran that it continues to be generously funded and well
equipped militarily at a time when Tehran itself is in difficulty meeting
its international obligations.
The increasing sophistication and effectiveness of Hizbollah attacks against
Israeli positions in southern Lebanon, especially during this month when
seven Israeli soldiers have been killed, was always likely, indeed designed,
to draw a response. However, Israel knows from long experience that air
attacks will not deter Hizbollah for long, while wider ground operations
carry the risk of additional casualties.
The reported deaths of several Syrian soldiers in yesterday's attacks also
illustrates how easily the conflict could broaden. Syria maintains at least
35,000 troops in Lebanon as part of an agreement between the two
governments. Israel, and no few Lebanese, see the Syrian presence as an
occupation, but the government in Beirut angrily rejects this. Mr Rafik
al-Hariri, Lebanese prime minister, insists that the Syrian forces will
withdraw as soon as they are no longer required, which is not the case with
Israel. However, there seems to be broad acceptance that the Syrians will
not pull back while Israel still occupies part of south Lebanon and the
Golan Heights. And despite more than 20 months of negotiations, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel have been unable to report any real narrowing of the
gaps.
The proximity of several of yesterday's air raids to the Syrian border was
obviously designed to stress the Israeli accusation that Damascus is
ultimately responsible for the increased activity of Hizbollah. There is
little argument that, although financed by Iran, most supplies reach
Hizbollah through Syrian-controlled territory.
The Israelis suspect, with some reason, that Syrian frustration at Israel's
refusal to commit itself to withdraw from the Golan Heights is shown by the
degree of latitude given to Hizbollah.
The danger of further military confrontation in Lebanon therefore remains
high, although President Hafez al-Assad, robbed of the diplomatic and
military backing of the former Soviet Union, is likely to measure any
response with great care. He will not wish to risk his perhaps irreplaceable
front-line aircraft against Israel, or expose his surface-to-air missiles in
the Bekaa valley to fresh attack.
For those reasons Mr Assad is certain to welcome the visit later this week
to the region by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. But for the
Americans, yesterday's events in Lebanon are the clearest warning yet of the
consequences of continued lack of progress in the Middle East peace process.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S financial community has given a mixed response to measures to
reduce inflation and reform foreign currency controls, announced by the Bank
of Israel and the Treasury.
From today a 2 per cent import surcharge and a 2 per cent export subsidy are
to be scrapped. There will also be a gradual 2 per cent shift in the central
rate of the shekel, in effect a gradual devaluation.
Announcing the measures on Saturday, Mr Jacob Frenkel, central bank
governor, and Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, stated their intention
to let the currency depreciate at an annual rate of 6 per cent.
The changes, said Mr Frenkel, were intended to move Israel closer to
eliminating all foreign exchange controls, creating a unified exchange rate
for the shekel, as well as to stimulate the economy.
He expressed the hope that they would allow a significant reduction in
interest rates.
Mr Shochat said he hoped the moves would lower inflation next year to 8 per
cent, from a predicted 10 per cent for 1993. 'They will also fuel growth in
the economy, stability and a gradual reduction in unemployment,' he said.
Israeli financial analysts hailed the package as a step forward in the fight
against inflation, but leading industrialists said it did not go far enough.
Mr Dan Propper, president of the Manufacturers' Association, called for an
immediate 3 percentage point cut in interest rates, and protested that the
scrapping of the import levy and the exports surcharge would undermine
Israeli competitiveness.
Several leading industrialists are known to have been pressing for an
immediate 6 per cent devaluation of the shekel.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Iraq denies missile fired at US jets: Baghdad seeks to play
down incident over 'no-fly' zone
</HEADLINE>

IRAQ yesterday rejected US reports that a surface-to-air missile had been
launched against a US air force jet over southern Iraq at the weekend,
claiming the defence department report was either a 'plot' or a
'hallucination'.
The statement followed reports from Washington that jets patrolling the
'no-fly' zone late on Saturday had seen a single projectile launched soon
after a US F-4G had fired at and hit an anti-aircraft missile site in the
area. The F-4G had been 'illuminated' by the site's radar.
The Iraqi response to the incident, made in a statement handed to reporters
in Baghdad, was less defiantly aggressive than previous reactions to
reported clashes in the 'no-fly' zone, set up by the Gulf war allies to
prevent Iraq using air power against rebel Shia groups in southern Iraq.
However, the firing of an anti-aircraft missile would be the first attack on
US jets since Iraq declared an informal ceasefire in the region following
President Bill Clinton's inauguration in January.
A Pentagon spokesman said that Saturday's missile launch had been witnessed
by two US jets and was the second such skirmish within a month. Another F-4G
'Wild Weasel' fired at an anti-aircraft site near Basra on June 29.
US aircraft patrolling the 'no-fly' zone from bases in Saudi Arabia are
under orders to attack any missile site if they are 'locked' by its radar.
Iraq said the defence department report 'is either hallucination on the part
of the pilots or an attempt by US administration circles to fabricate a
crisis'. Its dismissive tone suggests Iraq is anxious to avoid further
tension with the US while it embarks on a fresh charm offensive within the
United Nations, with the particular aim of persuading the Security Council
to consider easing economic sanctions.
Talks with the UN on a limited oil sale are expected to resume in New York
this week. Wide-ranging discussions on Iraq's compliance with UN ceasefire
terms are also scheduled to begin in New York as soon as next month. This
results from last week's resolution of a confrontation over the installation
of monitoring cameras at two missile test sites and Iraq's declaration that
it would consider long-term monitoring of all its weapons programmes.
A team of UN weapons inspectors arrived in Baghdad yesterday to install
video cameras at the two sites as part of a compromise brokered between Iraq
and the UN last week by Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN envoy.
The cameras will be turned off pending the results of the UN-Iraq talks next
month and the UN inspectors are expected to leave Iraq within four to seven
days.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Israel pounds Hizbollah bases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI aircraft, artillery and gunboats were reported to have carried out
fresh assaults on Arab guerrilla targets in Lebanon late last night, after
two Israeli civilians died in Arab rocket attacks across the border.
The mounting waves of attack and counter-attack were raising tension in the
region to a new pitch. Israeli air strikes in Lebanon earlier in the day
were the heaviest in more than a decade.
Security officials in Beirut said Israeli gunboats fired missiles late last
night at a Palestinian base at al-Bidawi camp, north of the port of Tripoli.
But there was no immediate word on casualties.
At the same time, Israeli aircraft and artillery were pounding guerrilla
targets in southern Lebanon, they said.
The night-time raids came after guerrillas had fired salvoes of Katyusha
rockets at Israeli targets in retaliation for the day of Israeli air and
artillery bombardment.
About 150,000 residents of northern Israel were spending the night in bomb
shelters for fear Arabs would fire more rockets. The army warned that
hundreds more rockets could be fired at Israeli targets overnight and in the
next few days.
Syria confirmed last night that three of its soldiers in Lebanon had been
killed and three others wounded during the daytime Israeli air attacks.
Lebanese security officials earlier said six Syrians had been killed by
shells or air raids, along with nine Lebanese.
The Israelis made clear that their operation would continue until there was
an end to attacks on northern Israel and on its self-declared security zone
in southern Lebanon.
They said their raids were aimed at strongholds of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Thousands of Lebanese
villagers fled out of range of the attacks.
The aircraft were sent in, after two weeks of threats, to avenge the killing
of seven Israeli soldiers this month in the bloodiest guerrilla attacks on
its forces in southern Lebanon in nearly three years.
Israel accused Syria, one of its partners in Middle East peace talks, of
backing the attacks on its forces in south Lebanon. It warned Damascus to
curb the Hizbollah and Palestinian fighters by cutting arms supply lines
from Iran.
Damascus rejected the warning and said it would regard any attack on Lebanon
as one on itself.
In Washington, the State Department urged Middle Eastern countries to
exercise utmost restraint and rely on peace negotiations to settle
differences.

FT  26 JUL 93 / Sheehy defends proposals for police shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERY FEW police officers are likely to have their careers 'abruptly
terminated' if fixed-term contracts are introduced by the government, Sir
Patrick Sheehy, chairman of the committee recommending the change, says
today.
Proposals to introduce fixed-term contracts are the most controversial
element of the Sheehy report. It recommends that all officers should be
employed on initial 10-year contracts, subsequently renewable every five
years.
Sir Patrick, writing in today's Financial Times, defends his committee's
radical proposals for changes in police pay and conditions. He accuses the
Police Federation, which represents the majority of officers, of having been
long on emotion and short on factual content in its response.
The Sheehy committee's proposals - which include performance related pay and
abolition of three ranks - have drawn opposition from all the police staff
associations.
Pressure on the government to tread carefully mounted yesterday when Mr Paul
Condon, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he might be unable to
continue in his post if some of the reforms went through.
Mr Condon, 45, who was handpicked by Mr Kenneth Clarke when home secretary
to modernise Britain's biggest police force, said in an interview in the
Observer newspaper that he would 'find it very difficult to be a well-paid
commissioner, presiding over a demoralised, badly-paid Metropolitan Police'.
While supporting some Sheehy recommendations, such as those for a flatter
management structure, Mr Condon said the inquiry had not understood the
motivation and nature of policing at street level.
The suggestion that the Sheehy committee has produced unrealistic
recommendations because none of its members had experience of policing has
been a consistent police service claim in the three weeks since the report
was published.
Sir Patrick, chairman of BAT Industries, says in his article that the
committee 'fully recognised that our lack of professional experience of
working with the police service made it vital that we should learn about the
police at first hand'. During 55 visits to 24 forces, he says, committee
members found that constables felt badly managed and chief officers lacked
the tools to manage them.
Sir Patrick describes the claim that fixed-term appointments would be
inconsistent with the concept of the police service as a vocation as a
'curious argument'. The only reasons for refusing to renew a contract would
be medical unfitness, gross misconduct, manifest incompetence, or structural
grounds.

FT  26 JUL 93 / PM's revelations hit hopes for party unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S efforts to call a truce in the Tory party's civil war over
Europe suffered a setback yesterday, as fresh battles loomed after
revelations by the prime minister himself about tensions within his cabinet.
Renewed bouts of sniping between the Eurosceptics and the Euro-enthusiasts
were inflamed by the publication in the Observer newspaper of a taped,
private conversation in which Mr Major spoke bitterly of the 'poison' being
spread by former rightwing ministers and the problems of managing a tiny
parliamentary majority.
'We don't want another three more of the bastards out there,' he said when
asked why he did not sack three cabinet ministers who threatened to resign
if he accepted the social chapter as the price for being able to ratify the
Maastricht treaty.
The latest setback comes as many Conservatives expect a humiliating defeat
in Thursday's by-election at Christchurch.
Factions within the party are already jockeying for position to influence
the government as it makes advance preparations for next June's elections to
the European Parliament and in its approach to future EC summits.
A further revolt by the Eurosceptics is threatened when the government
brings forward legislation on EC finance, in November.
The bill will implement the agreement which was reached at the Edinburgh
summit, increasing national governments' contributions to the Commission.
Though ministers describe it as a good deal, they concede that some hardline
rebels will probably oppose it.
The latest events cast a shadow over today's Anglo-French summit in London,
and comes just hours before the High Court is to hear the legal challenge to
the ratification process brought by Lord Rees-Mogg.
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, yesterday denied that the cabinet
was split over Maastricht, though he made it clear that any minister who had
serious reservations about the government's European policy should consider
his position.
He also called on Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, to set up an urgent
inquiry into how the conversation had been published. It was allegedly
recorded by the BBC during Mr Major's media interviews on Friday. The BBC
had earlier said that the material had been widely available: 'Any number of
places could have been the source of the story.'
The impression of discord was fuelled by Lord Tebbit, the former Tory party
chairman, who said that 'many ministers - perhaps most' hoped that the
Maastricht treaty would never come into effect.
On BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, he also hinted that the European elections
could be good for the Tory party. Perhaps it would make the extreme
Europhiles understand that the British people do not want to be 'dragged
into a union', he said.
The delicacy of trying to keep a balance within the Tory party was
underlined as it became clear that Mr Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic, had
not been offered a formal role in a 'new group' to be set up by Mr Douglas
Hurd, to determine the UK's policy in the run-up to the inter-governmental
conference in 1996, as had been reported.
Instead, Mr Hurd's aides said, Mr Cash had been offered a meeting with the
foreign secretary, whose door was open to all shades of opinion in the
party.

Spain's new finance minister, Pedro Solbes, has warned that the country's
recession shows no sign of ending and that a sharp reduction of labour costs
is required to stimulate the troubled economy. He indicated that there was

FT  26 JUL 93 / ERM pressure builds as threat to franc grows: Bundesbank
urged to consider problems of other EMS members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the European exchange rate mechanism looks set to build again
this week ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank central council.
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spanish finance minister, urged the Bundesbank to take the
problems of other European Monetary System members into account. 'The EMS
cannot live in a situation of permanent crisis,' he told the Financial
Times.
Large-scale intervention by the Bundesbank and Bank of France on Thursday
and Friday of last week did no more than hold the French franc at just over
1 centime above its lower intervention point in the ERM. In active trading
in Tokyo early today, the franc edged down from an opening level marginally
below FFr3.40 against the D-Mark.
Foreign exchange market operators now say that only a significant cut of
perhaps 1 percentage point in German interest rates will save the franc.
However, it is doubtful whether the Bundesbank could agree to such an easing
of credit conditions in the face of continued inflationary pressures in
Germany.
Although the Bank of France and Bundesbank have a formidable reputation for
defending the franc and giving speculators a 'bloody nose', developments in
financial markets late last week were inauspicious for the French currency:
Market assessments of the scale of a Bundesbank rate cut required to
alleviate the crisis rose steadily on Friday, from around half a percentage
point in the morning to a full point by the end of currency trading in
Europe;
Equities in Paris advanced on Friday, showing that investors there expect
the government to cave in to speculators and cut interest rates in the same
way the British government did after last September's departure of sterling
from the ERM;
Conservative bond market investors and pension fund managers were reported
to be moving funds out of the French into the German bond markets in the
expectation of a currency gain from a franc devaluation or suspension of the
ERM;
New York hedge fund managers confirmed that they had so far played hardly
any role in the latest round of speculation against the franc. But some made
clear that they were preparing to act this week unless there were clear
signs of the Bundesbank lowering interest rates.
Market analysts also say that the French banking system is in a less strong
position than before to support the French government's efforts to shore up
the franc through higher rates.
French banks co-operated with the government by not passing higher interest
rates to corporate and individual borrowers in the crises of last September
and early this year.
Banks are less able to take such a strain after suffering losses this year.
Moreover, the French government is in a worse position to 'twist arms' among
the state-owned banks because it is preparing them for privatisation and
cannot risk destroying their profitability.
The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, whose government has
repeatedly vowed to defend the franc's status in the ERM, is due in London
today with President Francois Mitterrand. That message is likely to be
repeated in their talks with the prime minister, Mr John Major.

FT  26 JUL 93 / China unveils tighter property controls to curb credit boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA announced at the weekend a 10-point 'clean-up campaign' to calm its
chaotic property market which is regarded as one of the main causes of an
explosion in credit over the past year.
Mr Wang Xianjin, director of the State Land Administration, spoke of 'chaos
in the land market' and said lax controls had created openings for
'unlawful' speculation.
Among the measures to check rampant speculation will be tighter land use
regulations. These would require an advance payment of at least 20 per cent
of the total project, excluding land price, before the land use right was
legally transferred.
Stringent controls will be imposed to ensure market prices for land sales.
Most land transfers in China have been by private treaty, opening the way
for widespread corruption.
Mr Wang also vowed to crack down on the unrestrained spread of economic
development zones which had mushroomed in the country. He estimated that
about 3,000 zones were in the planning stage or had been established.
The government had given approval for about 300 development areas which
offer tax breaks to foreign investors. Mr Wang said a review was being
conducted and zones that had not complied with procedures would be closed
down or would be turned into industrial parks, which do not have tax
incentives.
The Chinese official stressed that measures to clean up the property market
would not affect normal business, but he urged prospective purchasers of
property to familiarise themselves with the law.
Chinese attempts to cool the overheated property and land market coincide
with a government drive to bring the economy under control. China's economy
grew by nearly 13 per cent last year, and continued to expand rapidly in the
first six months of 1993.
The authorities have instituted a credit squeeze, and curbed speculative
loans. This seems certain to take some of the steam out of the property boom
which was already showing signs of faltering, especially in China's southern
areas.
The property 'clean-up campaign' also coincides with attempts to check land
speculation by the military, which has become deeply involved in business,
including property development. The Central Military Commission, China's top
military body, recently issued a directive, warning specifically against
speculative activities. It also said the army had no business becoming
engaged in building luxury holiday resorts, office buildings and hotels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Moeen Qureshi, Pakistan's interim prime minister, is to leave for
Washington tomorrow where he is expected to meet officials of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund to discuss his country's needs for
external financing, government officials said in Islamabad yesterday.
Mr Qureshi, a former vice president of the World Bank, was appointed last
Sunday until the October elections.
His appointment has raised speculation about his role in negotiating a
Dollars 1bn loan from the IMF which Pakistan is seeking under the Extended
Structural Adjustment Facility. Islamabad is pressed for time because the
ESAF window would close in November, senior western economists say. An IMF
mission is due here next week for further neogtiations.
Pakistan is also due to present its case at the annual 'aid to Pakistan'
consortium at Paris, in September, to seek Dollars 2.5bn in fresh loans. The
consortium meeting was originally due to be held in April, but was postponed
when Mr Nawaz Sharif's government was sacked.
Officials say that Mr Qureshi's contacts with the international financial
community should overcome any concerns about possible reverses in economic
policy.
Both Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, , the
main contenders in the elections, have made it clear that they would
continue with free market policies.
Acting President Wasim Sajjad swore in a six-member caretaker cabinet
yesterday to run Pakistan until national elections set for October 6, Reuter
adds from Islamabad.
The ministers were named as Syed Baber Ali, Mohammad Shafique, Ahmed Farooq,
Fateh Khan Bandial, Nisar Memon and Abdus Sattar, a retired senior diplomat
who was expected to take charge of foreign affairs.
All the ministers are reported to be retired bureaucrats or army officers,
chosen as political neutrals who would not try to influence the election
results. They will serve with Mr Qureshi.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Figures show decline in car output

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE car output figures for the first half of the year indicate that
production from January to June fell 7.2 per cent from the same period last
year.
Car production in Japan slumped to 5.9m units in the six months to June,
falling below the 6m level for the first time in almost eight years,
according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
The fall means the Japanese car industry has suffered its fifth consecutive
half-year decline. Jama said it did not expect demand to recover
significantly in the second half of this year.
Continued weakness in the Japanese market makes it possible that output for
the year will fall below 12m units for the first time since 1984, Jama said.
Among car makers Mazda suffered the largest fall, of 18.6 per cent, followed
by Nissan, which saw a decline of 14.6 per cent. Toyota, Japan's largest car
maker, fell 3.8 per cent.
The weakness of domestic demand is likely to put pressure on Japanese car
makers to step up exports.
However, US car makers have shown increasingly protectionist tendencies,
with the Big Three calling for reduced Japanese imports and claiming
Japanese car makers have dumped mini-vans in the US market.
The west European market is also extremely weak and Japan faces pressure
from the European Community to reduce the number of car imports allowed into
the EC, in a monitoring agreement it has with the Community.
At the same time, the yen's surge against the dollar this year has eroded
Japanese makers' competitiveness in world markets.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Dream house of horrors: Dominic Lawson explains why terror
stalks the English property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a horror story. There is a journalist, let us call her Mrs W, who
once offered to buy the house of a friend of mine. She had paid many visits
to the property, and they were on the verge of exchanging contracts. In the
course of these visits they had become friendly. Once they had even sung
madrigals together. This was civilised upper middle-class England at its
best.
'Tell me,' said the lady buyer when they had put the song sheets away,
'where are you moving to?' And the seller gave the name of the road where
stood the house of his dreams, on which he, too, was about to exchange
contracts. And that, as Edgar Lustgarten used to say, was his fatal error.
Two days later my friend received a call from the estate agent acting for
the vendor of his putative new home. There had been another bid for it,
Pounds 5,000 above his offer. A sudden ghastly thought struck my friend: 'It
wasn't from a woman called Mrs W, was it?'
Yup. It was. He told the agent that he would match Mrs W's offer, and after
doing so rang up Mrs W and confronted her with her treachery. 'We even sang
madrigals together,' he wailed. She seemed embarrassed, said she did not
know what had come over her, it was such a lovely house; but she would not
make another bid for it. 'But you've cost me Pounds 5,000,' he protested.
She apologised profusely.
Two days later he received another call from the estate agent who, in an
irritatingly, if understandably, chirpy manner told him that Mrs W had upped
her bid for his dream home by a further Pounds 5,000. 'She can have it,'
sighed my friend. As far as I know, he still lives in the house where he and
Mrs W sang madrigals together.
The moral of this story, if it can be called a moral, is that when it comes
to the property market, the respectable English middle classes tend to
behave in a very unrespectable way. Even those whose careers are far removed
from the wicked ways of commerce suddenly behave with the cynical savagery
of a Wall Street junk bond salesman when they see the home they want.
I am not superior in this respect, but you will just have to imagine the
depths to which I have sunk to ensure capture of the right property at the
right price, and I will just have to imagine what you have done. This is not
the confessional.
Perhaps it is not so surprising that we behave like animals in the property
market. The home is our nest; it is where we envisage our family safely
sleeping. There are scavenging predators out there; it is kill or be killed.
On a less anthropological level, the property market, in England at least,
is so organised as to cause maximum heartache and stress. Unlike Scotland,
there is no question of sealed bids and may the best man win. At every stage
we are fleeced by the professional classes with their overpriced surveys and
hidden commissions. The government, too, likes to twist the knife: stamp
duty on property transactions is the modern equivalent of the window tax -
and equally fair.
Most bizarre is the recondite business of 'valuations.' These are carried
out by myriad little companies for the benefit of mortgage lenders, with
whom the valuers enjoy a cosy and lucrative relationship. In recent years
the valuations carried out for the lenders have tended to be less than the
prices offered by would-be buyers, with the result that many people cannot
raise the mortgage they need to secure the property they want.
I know of a property which has three bidders, all offering the same price.
But none can buy because the 'valuation' placed on the flat by three firms
acting for three building societies is too low to cover the size of the loan
required.
This is the economics of the madhouse. The value of a property is what the
market is prepared to pay. And the market consists of buyers, not building
societies attempting to guess what will happen to a property's price in six
months time.
This system of 'valuation' is a Marxist concept, based on the notion that a
commodity has an inherent value quite distinct from any price which the
forces of supply and demand have determined.
The British property market is a bizarre mixture of unfettered capitalism
and socialist planning. No wonder it makes monsters of us all.
Dominic Lawson is taking a break from this column in order to write a book.
He will return in November.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Private View: Musical strains and the meaning of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VLADIMIR Ashkenazy holds the door open for other people. He pays their taxi
fares and is always saying thank you. He runs from place to place as if life
were just too short.
The pianist and conductor, a youthful prodigy of 56, was briefly in London
this week to announce a two-year, 40-nation tour of the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra of which he is music director. Since the RPO is one of the three
London symphony orchestras being required to undergo a beauty contest in
order to decide which gets a single Arts Council subsidy (the fourth, the
London Symphony, has been excused) I asked Ashkenazy what he felt about it.
I had expected an outburst, but Ashkenazy was sanguine. The subject did not
seem to excite him much. When, however, in the same context I asked why
classical music was still regarded as the property of the cultural elite,
the words began to pour.
'Do you know what I think it is? I've thought a lot about this thing in my
life. I think it is people don't want to produce any effort in order to go
further in their spiritual development as human beings. That's what it is.
'And then the easiest thing in the world is to say 'Oh, it's elitist. It's
not for me, I'm just too low . . . ha ha.'' He manufactured an ironic laugh.
'I don't like that. Human nature is always to get as much as possible
without much effort. Not always, of course, but it's a very strong
characteristic of human nature which I always fight in me. I fought it quite
successfully but I see too many people who want to grab and not give. In
order to appreciate the great gifts we have from - I don't know, Beethoven,
Stravinsky and Shostakovitch - you have to produce an effort. You have to
give. Effort is giving, of course.'
It was fear of having to work at it which prevented people reaching beyond
accessible pieces such as the Nutcracker Suite, Swan Lake or the New World
Symphony ('they are not cheap music, they are great music, absolutely
fantastic') and finding themselves in that world without which, he said,
music-lovers like himself could not live.
Ashkenazy is obsessed, but cheerfully, by a fear of laziness instilled in
him by his mother Evstolia when he was a child in Gorky. She was a good
Communist who was shocked by her son's decision to emigrate soon after
sharing first prize (with John Ogdon) in the 1962 Tchaikovsky piano
competition. His father David, a travelling accompanist in light music, was
rarely at home.
'When I was a boy, things came terribly easily to me on the piano and I
didn't work. I didn't have to. And then when I won my first prize (in the
Chopin competition in Warsaw) I realised that actually it's all terribly
difficult.' He laughed. 'Then I started to work . . . and never stopped
since.'
There is nothing conceited nor moralising about Ashkenazy's self-assessment.
He has a quick-witted energy kept well under control and finds time to
display perfect courtesy to others.
In view of his own competition successes I asked him: are young musicians
today being made to perform like circus animals?
'I'll try to say something intelligent about it,' he replied. 'There is no
straight answer to this. It is a phenomenon of our time. Maybe it is because
we are so many on this planet that we have to find a way of selecting the
best in this particular fashion. Or maybe it is our need for a spectacle
always, sport and spectacle, gladiators and all that.' On balance, he
thought, the negative outweighed the positive.
The Russian conservatoires have been accused of producing performers whose
technique outshines their musicianship. Ashkenazy said technical excellence
was indispensable but conceded that audiences and record companies can find
it hard to distinguish between what he called 'good delivery' and real
communication.
What will happen to Russian musicians now?
'I'm not very despondent about their state of affairs. I believe the Russian
nation is very potent, full of talent. It will never cease to produce
talent. I don't despair. It goes in cycles. It's a great country with great
indigenous culture and you can't extinguish it just like that.'
Do you regard yourself as primarily a deep-thinking musician and
interpreter, or primarily a deliverer?
'It's not for me to comment.'
You know your own talent, I said.
'You see, music means so much to me that once in a while I manage to send a
message of what it means to me . . . I can't put a label on it.'
Are you a better pianist or conductor?
'I've no idea, no idea. Sometimes I think I'm awful whatever I do. Sometimes
I think, well, maybe it wasn't so bad. It's not for me to say, absolutely
not. My attitude to my life and my activity is simply to do the best I
possibly can, with my potential, with my hard work. The rest is in the hands
of the elements.
'I learn all the time, I learn every day.' (Ashkenazy spends any free
minutes memorising a score). 'There is no end of searching for the truth,
the sincerity of your message, depth, honesty, whatever you want to call
it.'
I said it seemed a monastic sort of vocation.
'It only seems like this, you know? It's not monastic life. It is a sweet
slavery. But I have lived my life to the full as an individual. I have
fallen in love many times, I am married and I have my children and I have to
deal with lots of relationships with other people. My life is very complex
outside of music, very fulfilling.' Ashkenazy married an English-educated
Icelandic girl, Thorunn (known as 'Dody') whom he met at the Moscow
Conservatoire. They have five children. He added: 'After all, music is about
life.'
How is it about life?
'What else is it about?'
Maybe recreation, I said: sitting back and having pleasant sounds float over
your head.
'Of course some music, yes. But some of the most important music, the most
important self-expression of Beethoven or whoever you like - that's not
recreation. It's much more. It is actually perception of life.'
You cannot learn about life by listening to music, can you?
'Oh, yes. But you have to have a good background. You have to grow up to
that point. And if you've got to that point you can learn a lot.'
One might learn from poetry, I said. At least there are words and concrete
images.
'Yes but can you describe all your life with words? You can't. That's where
music comes in. Poetry is wonderful but the poetry is actually much beyond
the words. The words are only symbols.'
Is music at your level of engagement an intellectual thing or an emotional
one? Do you see humans as divided between heart and head?
'No. Mind for me is one thing. It is a unity of everything. Mind is what
decisions we make about our behaviour, about our activities, and those
decisions are based on an inter-relation between our emotional and
intellectual facilities. The proportion is probably different in all of us
but it's still a unifed process.'
Ashkenazy is fond of quoting a Russian poet who speaks of 'the intelligent
heart and kind brain'. He finds it difficult, he said, to justify dividing
music into Classical and Romantic, except in purely formal or historical
terms. 'Look at Mozart piano concertos. There's a lot of self-expression
there but it is in a strict form that developed at that point. Mozart almost
never went beyond that form. He extended it later but he never broke out.
Who knows, if he had lived another 20 years he might have done.'
Is classical music, as opposed to pop or jazz, dead?
'I simply don't know. I have been thinking about this particular topic for
years and years. Lots of people ask me this question, and I am afraid I have
no answer. It could be. But it could also not be. It might need an
overwhelming new talent to find the new path for our so-called classical
music. We can't predict anything. We couldn't predict the collapse of
Communism a few years ago. Most of us thought it would be in a few hundred
years.
'Even in pop music, which is a very primitive sort of basic, barbaric sort
of . . . I wouldn't even call it expression, you can't predict. Heavy metal
suddenly appeared once you thought they'd used up everything.'
Some people have an end-of-millenium feeling that our creative culture is
drying up and we are left worshipping the past. Do you subscribe to that?
'Do you know, we should look more into ourselves, inside our souls and think
more about why we are here on this earth, what we are trying to do with our
lives, what are our relationships with other people, and so on. And if we
look more into ourselves life could be different.
'I firmly believe that if we thought our mission in life was really to find
compassion and love and understanding, honesty and so on and trying to do
our best then life would be that much better for everyone, including the
protagonist himself or herself. And all the rest is secondary, I think. If
it all comes from within, there is so much more value to what we do - value
to everybody.'
Have you found anyone outside music who expresses this well?
'It's from here and there. After all, I didn't create my scale of values
just out of the clear air. It is the interrelation between music and what I
read in my life. I am interested in what people think about life: that's one
of my strongest interests, I think.'
He had recently read a book on Hegel - 'so interesting, so stimulating I
couldn't put it down' - overcoming an aversion acquired at school in the
Soviet Union to lectures on dialectal materialism.
How much exchange is there between music and your other worlds?
'Not much on the surface, but inside me a lot. Because I am not a groundless
idealist who thinks that everything revolves around me. I am very aware of
what is happening around me - intensely so, actually. No, no, I'm not
detached from the ways of the world today.
'I'm lucky that I do what I always wanted to do and I have a gift from
Nature. That's incredible, I think, it's fantastic. But I know how hard life
can be.'

<TEXT>
I HAD another chess lesson yesterday in the company of two friends: Queen
Elizabeth II, head of the House of Windsor, and John Major, prime minister
of Britain. We are preparing ourselves for the world chess championship
tussle in September between Britain's Nigel Short and the title-holder,
Russia's Gary Kasparov. Our teacher is Nigel himself.
The Queen is the star pupil, for she demonstrates mid-game finesse, deep
strategic skill, and end-game brutality. Nigel has warmed to her greatly;
his affection is reciprocated. John Major is the dunce: unable to master
tactics, utterly free of guile, and a ditherer to boot. Nigel treats him
kindly.
With the country teetering on the brink of a bottomless chasm, you might
think it strange that the Queen and prime minister found time to indulge
themselves in a chess lesson. I was surprised they turned up. But they
always keep their appointments.
The Queen chimed and shone. She is convinced that the danger in which her
family found itself earlier this summer is receding. The monarchy is safe.
It has had to trim its sails, but there will be a king (or queen) of England
long after she has gone. The prime minister, however, is not yet aware of
the danger he is in. He is still a cheery chappie - like a dinosaur happily
munching while the asteroid that will obliterate it settles into its
approach run.
Yesterday, we were supposed to be studying Nigel's game against Ljubojevic
(Reykjavik, 1987), in which he used the Yugoslav Attack. But our hearts were
not in it. There was far more chat than chess. The Queen was worried in case
Nigel was being hounded by the media in the run-up to his title match.
She said: 'It is imperative that one is not distracted from one's mission in
life by the tittle-tattle of gossips, or by pensees creuses. The newspapers
are appalling. But book-writers are worse. There has been such a flood of
books about oneself and one's family that one was in danger of submerging.
'For example, there was a book recently by the dreadful Anthony Holden in
which this provincial little man - he really is quite short, you know, and
was born in the north of England - had the gall to estimate the cost of the
monarchy to the British taxpayer in 1992 as exceeding Pounds 75m, or Pounds
192,000 per day - 'more', claimed this common little person, 'than 13 times
the average national wage, before tax, per year.'
'What an impertinence. With whom did this gobe-mouches check his facts? One
could have pointed him in the right direction had he consulted oneself. But
of course he did not telephone one. How could he possibly dare? Lupo
affamato mangia pan muffato, Nigel - a famished wolf eats mouldy bread.
Whatever you do, avoid journalists and book-writers. They will stab you in
the back.'
'Actually,' said Nigel, 'it's really brill at present. No one is hounding
me. They've forgotten I exist. People have convinced themselves that
Kasparov the Barbarian is going to tear me into such small and bloody pieces
that they're avoiding me like the plague.'
'I wish I could say the same,' said the prime minister soulfully. 'It is a
considerable surprise to me how consumed the media are with negative
matters. Because the Maastricht treaty has encountered a few administrative
difficulties in the House of Commons, the political journalists - a
singularly ill-informed group, if I may venture to say so - are whipping up
hysteria.
'But you only have to peruse the inside pages of the newspapers to
acknowledge that many excellent developments are happening in Britain. We
have the strongest economy in Europe. The number of abortions in England and
Wales fell in 1991 for the first time since 1983. A considerable enlargement
of the M25 orbital motorway has been announced.
'The long-range weather forecast is particularly excellent. Our cricketers
are reasserting themselves. Crime is falling. Arrests are rising. The number
of operations conducted in our hospitals is increasing all the time. We have
much to be proud of. Our astronomers at Greenwich have even spotted a new
asteroid. I believe it is a large one. It is emitting steam and flames. When
I get home tonight I plan to observe it, through my binoculars.'
Just then, the lesson ended.

FT  24 JUL 93 / As They Say in Europe: 'Football and television inebriate
rapidly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WE ride the great Euro-Community not-very-merry-go-round, one passenger
after another falls ill. Not as unwell as some of those on the outside, but
worse than they have been for 40-odd years. Britain, Germany and Italy have
all appeared sickly. Now eyes are turning to France.
The French franc has been transformed in a matter of days from a potential
currency anchor to speculators' favourite. That was linked, on the face of
it, to some unsurprisingly gloomy forecasts about immediate prospects for
the economy.
However, the team of analysts employed by this column detected two entirely
different factors undermining the republic. The first was the extraordinary
wound inflicted by the great football scandal which has undermined the
presidency, the system of justice and made everyone look unusually stupid.
New readers begin here: the story opened with the allegation last month that
the European champions, Olympique Marseille, had become champions of France
by bribing members of the Valenciennes team to throw a crucial match.
A common enough tale of footballing folk, you might think, but the boss of
OM is the renowned socialist millionaire Bernard Tapie, while the procurator
for Valenciennes, Eric de Montgolfier, turned out to be a man who relished
the opportunities for cutting a dash hitherto denied him by run-of-the-mill
villainy.
He appeared frequently on TV to discuss the case and his role in it. As a
result, he was called in by the minister of justice and told to shut up.
Meanwhile, the same minister was suing Bernard Tapie, who had compared the
state's investigative techniques unfavourably with those of the Gestapo.
De Montgolfier promised to behave better and called a press conference to
protest his innocence. And, in an exclusive interview with Liberation, he
said he regretted only one remark: 'I am distracting the pack.' By this he
had meant that he kept the media at bay while the investigation proceeded.
The remark had been inspired, said de Montgolfier, by an event at an al
fresco press conference. A municipal registrar standing on a roof had taken
a photo of the procurator which showed his bald head surrounded by a hirsute
press mob.
Liberation wrote: 'Football and television inebriate rapidly. Mixed with a
certain wilfulness in the administration of justice, we are in an infernal
cocktail.' The presumption of innocence, said some, had been forgotten.
President Mitterrand, on the other hand, while demanding prudence in the
conduct of the case, had praised the 'energy' and 'intelligence' of his
friend Tapie,' . . . as if these qualities in themselves were guarantees of
honesty and moral rigour,' wrote Ouest-France.
The second cause of the republic's present discontent is to be found in the
crisis at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which ended
in Jacques Attali's departure a week ago.
This event destroyed a substantial market for French suppliers who, under
the benign rule of Attali, had had no need to worry about such details as
competitive bidding. The affair added to the mood of self-doubt. France-Soir
summarised it characteristically: 'Attali, Jacques. Graduate of the
Polytechnique, the School of Mines, Sciences Po, National School of
Administration (ENA), doctor in economic science. The finest collection of
degrees in the republic. A head, a brain, a machine for thinking . . .
Jacques Attali. Delirium. Megalomania.'
French megalomania is beginning to upset the Germans - always an unwise
move. Klaus Engelen of Handelsblatt was sufficiently upset to ask: 'Why
can't the French let others run an international financial institution once
in a while?' The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and
the International Monetary Fund are led by Frenchmen and Paris says that it
has the right to appoint Attali's successor.
Engelen's view, expressed with his customary tact, is that once the French
control anything they exploit it ruthlessly. 'The IMF was turned into a
self-service shop for French and US interests. The French get the top jobs,
the Americans all the power and the Germans and Japanese provide the money.'
But Engelen is mistaken. The French are not like that, at least not
according to an opinion poll which led Ouest-France to comment: 'In today's
France, which moans about its fate while reading its balance sheets, beliefs
are not what they are said to be. Skilled, educated, cared for, the French
today want only tranquility. Their happiness lies above all in good health,
then work followed by love, justice and friendship. Money is their last but
one concern.'
Football, television and megalomania come nowhere, apparently.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Tell-tale Tony - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIVES of eminent politicians are usually serialised somewhere, but Tony
Benn MP has set a new standard by offering the exclusive rights of his
diaries to Radio 4. As is well known, every night before he goes to bed he
tapes his day's recollections. We heard the first tape of this lot on
Wednesday, at 9.45am - a notable day, marking the resignation of Harold
Wilson on March 17 1976, but actually rather dull.
At the farewell dinner, the recorder lay on the table, but only one phrase
was worth it - 'I've never been a back-bencher,' Wilson said, 'now we can
put that right.' The resignation, kept secret even from colleagues, was
foreseen by the government car service personnel. They have to find a car
for every former prime minister, so Wilson had already been allotted one.
With Plutarch at one elbow and Robin Lane Fox at the other, I hear Radio 4's
new Classic Serial, Alexander, not to learn anything fresh about that great
hero, but to find how writer David Wade has managed to make the exciting
story as exciting as it must be. This week's instalment (of six) began at
Pella, Macedonia, in 356 BC, where Olympias had King Philip's son; and ended
with Alexander about 10 years old - 'a squalid boy', Demosthenes reckoned
him (nor did he change his mind later).
Those 10 years were full of good detail, from the very birth on. Olympias's
parturition was packed with legend - the lion, the snake, the oracle at
Dodona, the boy's dedication to Zeus Ammon. There was a visit to the
Dionysian festivities. We meet Barsine, who became Alexander's Persian
mistress, and Hephaestion, who became his boy-friend. The luxury of
Olympias's care ended when Philip appointed the Spartan Leonidas as tutor, a
believer in cold baths at daybreak. Pausanias lurks with fatal steel. We
shall meet all these people over the weeks, and David Wade has kept the
story vivid by telling it through the memories of Achilles and Patroclus -
not the heroes from the Iliad, I suspect, but Alexander's companions. The
boy Alexander was remarkably well played by Sam Crane.
Greek drama on Sunday on Radio 3 too, another bit of The Golden Ass; but
Radio 3 has also revived its other drama slot, Studio 3, for experimental
writing, on Saturdays. This week it gave us Gie Lienen's Tales from the
Hatbox, translated from the Flemish by Gilberte Lenaerte. The hatbox
contains photos of the Warsaw ghetto in 1941, taken by a Wehrmacht NCO, and
toys kept in memory of young friends. It belonged to the NCO's son by a
Jewish woman, brought up by a ghetto survivor. The tales tell of the people
in the photos, sad tales of an all-too-familiar kind, illustrated with
sounds from the toys. I found it slow and sentimental, with too much detail.
Nothing experimental here.
Tonight Studio 3 offers a very different piece, Headcrash, by Michael Wall.
It supposes a new universe based on motorways. Boy, the hero (Jeremy Flynn),
drives along a fantastic road, happily hitting anyone in his way. His
girl-friend Yoka (Toyah Wilcox), swathed in bandages from some recent
disaster, and scared only of the rats swarming in the tunnels, shoots
drivers of competing cars. Besides the roads, there are 'lost cities', where
only 'creeps' - if anyone - live.
At a road-block, a female Field Controller ruthlessly orders Yoka into
reserve and Boy to a new level. His Mother (Mary Wimbush) appears, goes
through the motions of ordinary mothers, then orders him to be mean, to
hate, before disappearing in devilish fire. So Boy drives on, boosted by a
voice that cries 'Good hitting]' It sounds dotty, but such a world may be
imagined by someone maddened by exposure to the M25, and Jeremy Mortimer's
production, with its ghastly sounds, is as expert as the writing.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Lost in the Louvre - Patricia Morison braves the
crowds in France's treasure house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU plan to be in Paris this summer, a word of warning about the current
plight of the Louvre. It is almost exactly two centuries since, on August 10
1793, the former royal palace of the Louvre opened its doors for the first
time to the French public as a museum of art. Just now, however, the Louvre
is in a royal mess.
Of course, il faut souffrir pour etre beau, and with every day the
realisation of President Mitterrand's Grand Louvre project comes a little
nearer. On November 18 the public will be admitted to the refurbished
Richelieu Wing, formerly the Finance Ministry, which stretches along the Rue
de Rivoli. The size of the Louvre will be effectively doubled, although that
will not mark the end of the museum's travail. Reorganising the collections
and galleries in the 'old' part of the Louvre will take another four years.
For the moment, most of the outside of the Louvre is a huge building site
and so, for good measure, is the Tuileries Gardens. Inside, signs of brutal
disruption are all too evident. Dust lies on the black marble thighs of the
antique statue of Socrates expiring in his bath. An unbelievable number of
paintings are on temporary display, including the entire early French
collection and the Mona Lisa. Poor thing, she always was mobbed in summer
months. Now she creates a major traffic-jam in the Grande Galerie, which for
the remainder of its once glorious length has turned into a rat-run.
Many antiquities are currently not on view and the cabinet rooms of the
Flemish and early Dutch collection are closed. To add to the public's
discomfiture, the Louvre's colour-coded ground plan, fiendishly difficult to
use at the best of times, is now largely irrelevant.
The inevitable crush of summer visitors makes the Louvre a wilting
experience - or worse, if you fall victim to the pickpockets who gleefully
work the Pyramid. Last week was my first experience of Pei's grand gesture
in peak season and I was struck by how different it is from the traditional
entrance to a temple of high culture. There is not a work of art to be seen.
Instead, the concourse of the Pyramid resembles a busy airport terminal or a
shopping mall. It is a place of light, heat, bustle and hubbub.
The din is largely contributed by teenagers of many lands, who evidently
find the Pyramid an exhilarating experience not dissimilar from the
underground shopping at Les Halles. Herded in and then abandoned by their
guides, they are surprised to discover that the Palais du Louvre is not in
the least stuffy and boring. It is, in fact, a terrific place to shout and
run about. They are delirious by the time they ascend to the galleries.
I admit with shame that many years ago, I was expelled from a Paris museum
by a warder who considered that my bare feet demeaned the dignity of his
institution. It would be interesting to know how far you would have to go in
today's Louvre before anyone would take notice, let alone chuck you out. The
Louvre appears to field remarkably few warders, which means that there is no
one to help you find your way. More seriously, it gives the signal that the
authorities have given up any attempt to enforce what were once seen as the
proprieties of museum visiting. If this is to be the shape of the new,
thoroughly egalitarian, non-elitist Grand Louvre, then I at least will mourn
the passing of the old.
If you are minded to brave the Louvre (and next week I shall report on the
summer exhibitions), there is one really useful piece of information,
although people in the know will kill me for mentioning it. No one can quite
credit that Pei's Pyramid has just a single revolving door as the only means
for giving the millions access. Ah, but it is not] Before 5pm it is possible
to enter the Louvre via the little-used Porte Jaujard in the Pavilion de
Flore at the end of the south-western wing whose facade is now obscured by
building mess in the Place du Carrousel. It is most easily accessible from
the Quai des Tuileries.
Another dodge to make life more bearable, not just at the Louvre but at the
Musee d'Orsay and other cultural bottlenecks, is to buy the Carte Musees. It
gives admission to 65 museums and monuments in Paris and the region,
including the Arc de Triomphe and Versailles. It is said you will not have
to queue. One day costs Pounds 7.50/FFr60; three days, Pounds 15/FFr120;
five days, Pounds 21/FFr170. It must be used on consecutive days. (Entry
prices range from FFr25 to FFr40.) It can be bought in museums and metro
stations, and in the UK is sold by Voyages Vacances Internationales (071-287
3171.)

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: A conductor who fell in love with Europe - Andrew
Clark profiles Donald Runnicles, a British star who has forged his career
abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Donald Runnicles lifts his baton to conduct Tannhauser at the Bayreuth
Festival on Monday, it will not be without a sense of irony. He is only the
third British musician to be invited to conduct at Bayreuth in the
festival's 117-year history - but his success owes little to his British
origins.
Runnicles has made his career almost entirely outside Britain, and seems in
no hurry to come back. In spite of his apparent neglect by our orchestras
and opera companies, the 39-year-old Scot from Edinburgh says he does not
feel like a prophet without honour in his own land. He has received
invitations from ENO, Covent Garden and Scottish Opera - but they clashed
with other commitments.
The truth is that Britain has missed the boat with one of the most gifted
conductors of the younger generation. When Runnicles did have time, he was
snapped up by continental and American companies who recognised dynamic
musicianship when they saw it. He made his Met debut in 1988 with Lulu. He
was appointed music director of the San Francisco Opera in 1991. His
Bayreuth debut came last year. Next month he conducts Don Giovanni in
Munich, followed by The Ring and Salome at the Vienna State Opera. Upcoming
are engagements in Berlin, Chicago and Israel, lined up by Columbia Artists
Management, the New York agency which manages his career.
Runnicles' outstanding assets are his technical control, the personal
conviction he brings to every piece of music he conducts, and his intimate
understanding of opera, based on practical experience. Energy, passion,
theatrical sweep - these are qualities often cited in Runnicles
performances. After a Mahler Third Symphony last season in Freiburg, where
he has just ended a four-year contract as Generalmusikdirektor, Runnicles
was dubbed a 'Mahler Ekstatiker' - pacing the music coherently while living
for the moment.
Unlike some better-known but less talented contemporaries trumpeted by the
recording industry, Runnicles had the good fortune to learn his craft out of
the limelight. He studied at Edinburgh University and the London Opera
Centre, but instead of waiting for one of the handful of junior conducting
posts in Britain to become vacant, he opted to work his way up the German
opera house system. His first job was as ballet pianist in Mannheim. Within
a year he was on the opera staff, and by the time he left Mannheim nine
years later in 1987, he had conducted 40 operas.
It was a tough apprenticeship, but it taught him the nuts and bolts of
conducting - how to start and stop an orchestra, how to modify a chord by
gesticulation, how to pull off a successful performance without rehearsal.
'The advantage of starting off in Germany is the regularity of performance,
night after night. It's going into a pit feeling fresh, feeling ill, feeling
prepared, feeling slightly terrified, going in knowing there's a new Leonore
and meeting her just before the performance. I'm not suggesting a similar
situation is not possible in Britain, but in Germany it is an everyday
occurence.
'In a house like Mannheim, you are confronted with a huge repertoire -
tonight it's Italian, tomorrow German, then French. The younger you are when
you start learning these works, the easier they are to absorb. It can sound
a bit like a sausage machine, but there are so many challenges - just to
find out that you can always do it. The best way to learn conducting is to
conduct, but the set-up of opera in Britain means that unless you are a
staff conductor with one of the main companies, you don't get enough chances
to make conducting second nature.'
Although he maintains a strong interest in British music, from Vaughan
Williams to David Matthews, Runnicles makes no claims to be 'particularly
patriotic', and says his home at the edge of the Black Forest will continue
to serve as his European base. In spite of his growing list of guest
engagements, he is at heart a company man, and refers to his San Francisco
job as a long-term commitment. But he is already being tipped as a future
music director in one or other of the big German cities.
What is clear is that more frequent British appearances - never mind a
London debut - are unlikely in the foreseeable future. He pays tribute to
Anthony Whitworth-Jones, Glyndebourne's general administrator, for 'keeping
at it' until the right opening appeared - a unanimously praised Don Giovanni
at the 1991 festival. And it will be at Glyndebourne that Runnicles next
conducts opera in Britain - Queen of Spades in 1995. There are also the
makings of a link with the Edinburgh Festival: following his Scottish
Chamber Orchestra concert there last year, he will open the 1994 festival
with Mahler's Eighth Symphony.
Son of the choirmaster and organist at the episcopal church in Morningside,
Runnicles says his church background has always been an important influence.
'That's where I learned organ and piano. It's sometimes hard for me to find
common ground between this background and conducting a work such as Salome,
so sensuous and seductive that it's almost corrupting - I almost feel as if
it's a sin to be enjoying it] This was never the music we heard at home. It
was me with my radio when I was growing up, listening to Bayreuth broadcasts
while the family were downstairs - I wanted to hear it. Ever since, church
music has been something terribly sobering and purifying, and at the end of
a day I still listen to it. I need that, because this operatic world which I
love is just one inflated ego.'
The 1993 Bayreuth Festival opens tomorrow with a new production of Tristan
und Isolde. Donald Runnicles conducts Tannhauser on July 26, August 1, 7,
14, 18 and 23.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Aix proves bankrupt of ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RECESSION bites in France, it is likely that the arts will face a
difficult few years. There is a rumour that the Aix-en-Provence festival is
uncertain how far its formerly secure patronage will be maintained next
year. Unfortunately its fund of artistic inventiveness inconveniently seems
to be running out at the same time.
Of this year's three operas, two were intellectually bankrupt. The more
important failure was Weber's Euryanthe, which always seems to be unlucky in
the theatre. The opera is the very archetype of the early-romantic German
lyric drama, an idealised vision of medieval chivalry, told in vivid musical
narrative. There is no obvious reason why its spirit should be difficult to
convey, although one might not have thought so from ENO's drab production in
the 1970s.
This effort at Aix was worse. For an evening of visual ghastliness it could
hardly be surpassed. Forget romantic forests, rocky gorges, castle halls.
For the opening scene the only prop was an enormous spiked ball hanging from
the ceiling of a grey hall. The women of the chorus wore a variety of
designer flowerpots on their heads; the men stood around in hang-dog fashion
dressed as medieval oafs. When a group of girls in flimsy blue bikinis
fluttered on, they seemed quite uninterested. Everything was enervated,
gloomy, ugly.
The producer of this sorry enterprise was Hans Peter Cloos, the designer
Jean Haas. The extent of their combined ingenuity can be judged from the
heroic battle in Act 3. In a wild ravine (empty stage, low lighting) Adolar
is supposed to face a monster in combat. Insteaed he sits motionless on an
empty stage, while his adversary turns out to be a woman who appears in a
puff of dry ice on a platform way out of reach - poor girl, this was her
second role of the festival, in the nude again, but now bald as well]
For the stage-wise singer, ready to seize an opportunity, the production
offered an open door. Karen Huffstodt, as the evil Eglantine, duly took it,
staking her claim to the most dramatic role of the opera with a portrayal of
Hollywood bad-girl glamour, school of Bette Davis, accompanied by singing of
the fearsome vocal part that was confident and abandoned. She stole the
show.
In an interesting contrast, her partner-in-crime Lysiart was played by
Andreas Schmidt, whose impeccably-moulded singing made inward all that she
externalised so forcibly. Once past the ungratefully-written opening aria,
Thomas Moser's Adolar was strong and secure. Elisabeth Meyer-Topsoe was an
able, not very moving Euryanthe. Jeffrey Tate conducted what seemed an
undersized English Chamber Orchestra, unable to give the music sufficient
punch in this open-air venue. The opera should be seen to be the forerunner
of Wagner's grand music dramas. Here it merely seemed to be as long as one.
                          *       *       *
Just a note on Don Giovanni. This was officially a revival, although in
practice the original production last year had been judged such a disaster
that the producer, Giorgio Marini, was asked to re-think from scratch. To
anyone coming to this staging for the first time, it was difficult to see
what his re-thinking had entailed. Or, indeed, if any thinking had taken
place at all.
Mozart described Don Giovanni as a 'dramma giocoso', but neither drama nor
comedy was to be divined either from the stage action, or from Armin
Jordan's stylish, but undramatic conducting. Once again, individual singers
were left to put across their own performances with success, where they
could. Hillevi Martinpelto as Donna Anna and John Mark Ainsley as Don
Ottavio won the audience's enthusiastic approval, a view with which I would
not take issue. Deborah Riedel stood in bravely as Donna Elvira at short
notice. But this was not a Don Giovanni of festival standard.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Thinking big in Bregenz - Summer Festivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN BREGENZ built its Seebuhne, its opera-stage on beautiful Lake Constance
 -really on it, not beside it, utilising a neglected islet - nobody would
have thought they were testing Providence. For many years it was just a
picturesque place for staging summer operetta and musical comedy, for a
popular audience in the lakeside bleachers. It afforded pretty
lighting-effects on the waters between; if the show was Eine Nacht in
Venedig, there could be gondolas. And if it rained, as in Bregenz it very
often does, that was no great tragedy.
All that changed when Jerome Savary and then David Pountney were invited to
produce real operas, and succeeded beyond expectation: Bregenz now has a
significant opera festival. The islet has grown into a massive Captain Nemo
construction, honeycombed with secret tunnels, machinery and electronic
circuits for generating giant-scale wizardry. In case of rain, the new
Festspielhaus on the shore can accommodate a fraction of the dampened
audience, but only for a 'concertante' version of the opera they came to
see.
When patches of sun and flash showers alternated all day on Wednesday, with
the international press in town for Pountney's new production of Verdi's
early Nabucco, municipal anxiety was great. In the event Providence smiled:
Ulf Schirmer's brisk conducting of the overture got gently sprinkled, but
after that nothing more came from the constantly threatening clouds. The
missing thunder and lightning were fully compensated by the roaring
stage-effects, by Stefanos Lazaridis's spectacular sets (barbaric splendour
for 'Nabucco'/Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian forces, piously severe
white-and-black expanses for the downtrodden Jews), by bold attacks on the
principal roles and by Pountney's aggressive reading of the opera.
'Aggressive', because nobody - in a largely Austrian audience - is allowed
to forget that this is an opera about the persecution of the Jews. Amid the
ancient-world trappings, there are modern army uniforms and machine-guns.
During the overture, schoolchildren are marshalled into a black boat and
shipped away, their confiscated violins flung into the water. The great 'Va
pensiero' chorus is delivered by agonised families behind a metal fence,
topped with barbed wire, confronting the audience along the full breadth of
the playing-area.
Beyond the brutally underlined message, Pountney indulges in no Freudian
games or surrealist trickery. The singers go through the traditional
grand-opera paces (sometimes from dizzying heights), as they must in such a
huge venue. Since the opera is played almost nightly, the principal roles
are doubly, triply and even quadruply cast. Nobody needs to force, however;
with the sophisticated amplification - for singers and unseen orchestra
alike - more lyrical detail comes across than in many opera houses.
In the first-night cast, Covent Garden's Gregory Yurisich outdid himself as
a towering, tortured Nabucco, his mad scenes ever more sonorous and subtle.
As his daughters Abigaille and Fenena, respectively nasty and nice, young
Jane Thorner-Mengedoht wielded a curious, husky voice to strong dramatic
purpose and Vesselina Kasarova was true and sweet. The latter's Jewish lover
Ismaele was the eager, virile Paolo Kudriavchenko; Michail Krutikov lent his
imposing bass to the high priest Zaccaria.
With the Vienna Symphony, choruses from the Vienna Volksoper,Sofia and
Bregenz were admirably energetic. The naughty thought occurred that since
digital tape must be in play, if later casts should prove weaker they could
just mime to the first-night soundtrack: hardly anybody would twig.
Performances held most nights until August 22.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: How many orchestras do we need? - Sir Alan Peacock
adds his voice to the Arts Council cash debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR ALAN PEACOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council has had a difficult time over the recent decision to fund
only two orchestras in London. Following a long tradition of assuming
infallibility in cultural judgments, musical pundits have ritually
castigated the Council for having the courage of its convictions. But it has
taken nearly 25 years for the Arts Council to endorse the findings of the
closely-reasoned Report of the Orchestral Resources Enquiry published in
1970.
Let me declare an interest. I was the chairman of that enquiry, which
included among its musician members such luminaries as Malcolm Arnold, Myers
Foggin and Thomas Russell. Lord Goodman, the then chairman of the Arts
Council, disregarded the advice of his music committee and offered the
committee the choice of revising its conclusions or having them denounced on
publication. The committee refused to budge. A charter for sensible funding,
not only of London but of all government-assisted orchestras, was torn to
shreds.
In the interim, our ideas have regained currency. The more thoughtful
internationally-known conductors and players have recognised that squaring
the interests of those who perform music with those who have to pay the
piper is a much more complex matter than would appear from the emotional
outbursts of musical interest groups. I am proud of that report but my views
on funding the arts have changed considerably since those days.
Such views cannot be divorced from one's value judgments about the 'good
society'. I would like as many people as possible to have the opportunity to
enjoy good music and to be so taken with it that they are willing to pay for
it. Only the integration of arts education with our general education will
achieve such an objective. There is a dilemma in the case of music because
many serious composers of today are not primarily interested in winning over
the public but in maximising their reputation with each other. There is
nothing inherently wrong in their doing so - at their own expense.
I calculate that no orchestra in the UK can afford to offer living composers
more than 10 per cent of its programme time. Still, I support the funding of
new and unfamiliar musical experiments. However, the general aim to be
achieved - I suspect never completely - will be to adopt funding methods
which win the public round to voluntary support so that state funding
becomes unnecessary. The emphasis in funding should shift towards supporting
music societies and educational institutions, and even individuals through
voucher systems targeted to particular groups.
It is a far cry from this description of the ideal to the realities of
direct funding of major symphony orchestras (along with all large arts
companies) which have acquired all the advantages of incumbency. If we have
to live with this method In the meantime, then some of its worst features
should be eradicated.
The most important one is that it encourages the belief among the big
players that they have a right to direct funding in perpetuity. This is
surely wrong. The interest of the tax-paying public is in specific art
forms, music being a major one, and the 'demand mix' will change as public
tastes develop. That being so, the system of direct subsidy must be flexible
between different art forms and between those wishing to provide the
services required within each art form. There should be more open
competition for funding. Arts companies should hold 'franchises' for a
number of years, after which the franchise holders would have their
performance measured against that of possible new entrants.
The Arts Council proposals for funding London's orchestras is therefore a
step in the right direction, and I hope that it will pave the way for the
more flexible funding arrangements that I have proposed.
First, the concentration of funding to achieve artistic excellence makes
sense. Second, it would be wrong to 'Balkanise' artistic funding and give
the London so-called 'national' orchestras, opera and ballet companies
direct access to the Department of Heritage. This is merely a device for
special treatment which conflicts with the present policy of increasing
access to arts events nationally. There is no reason why the top slice of
arts funding should be allocated to metropolitan institutions, and every
reason why the Arts Council should decide on the 'opportunity cost' of
funding them, alongside the alternative uses of funds.
Third, those who have mocked the setting up of a committee under Sir Leonard
Hoffman which will recommend who will join the LSO as the second funded
orchestra lay themselves open to the charge that they believe that any
recommendation should be supplied only by those who represent the producer
interest. I agree that a necessary condition for being chosen must be clear
evidence of artistic excellence, but this in itself is not a sufficient
condition. Evidence of good management and a firm commitment to winning
audiences for adventurous programmes must also be provided.
The Arts Council is an easy target. Those who are denied funding protest
about those who get it, and those who get it protest that what they get is
not enough. Being a member is the easiest way of losing friends and
alienating people. The Bard says somewhere that 'rich gifts wax poor when
givers prove unkind'. Whatever decision the Arts Council eventually takes
about the second orchestra, reasonable people may disagree with it. The
trouble is that the voice of reason may be difficult to detect among those
who trade in cultural polemics. When it comes to spreading light rather than
heat about the funding of the arts, the musical public is at present
particularly poorly served by influential metropolitan critics.
Sir Alan Peacock was Chairman of the Scottish Arts Council (1986-92). The
themes in this article are expanded in his forthcoming book, Paying the
Piper, to be published in September by Edinburgh University Press.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Kirov's tarnished treasure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREATEST treasure in the Kirov Ballet's repertory is The Sleeping
Beauty. This ultimate exposition of the grandeur and noble aspirations of
academic dancing was made at the Mariinsky Theatre for the troupe whose
direct descendants we see today. Across war and revolution and social
change, through siege and the dissolution of a political system, the
miracles of Tchaikovsky's score and Petipa's choreography have been
preserved in a dance style as serene in proportion, as civilised in
humanity, as the great city which gave them birth. To sit in the Mariinsky
Theatre and watch Beauty, is to sense something of the moral implications
('Dance is a moral question,' said Balanchine, product of this theatre's -
and of Beauty's - traditions) as well as the physical harmonies the ballet
celebrates.
The Kirov has toured Beauty since its first venture to the West with the
Covent Garden season of 1961. Then Beauty looked sublime, in ensemble as in
the performances of such glorious artists as Kolpakova, Sizova, Zubkovskaya,
Sokolov, Solovyov. Whatever the vicissitudes of the company's history
thereafter, I have felt that Beauty was the touchstone of its qualities, the
vital point of reference for the troupe's well-being. Touring imposes
constraints upon effects and, maybe, casting. But in Thursday's performance
that brought the piece into the Coliseum repertory, I noted erosions of
manner, accommodations of effect, which minimised the piece, and the
company's golden reputation.
The staging looked cramped - which it did not at Covent Garden - and
somewhat cursory. Was it necessary to reduce the Hunting scene - whose
autumnal grace the Kirov alone knows how to show - into a bad joke about
arrows thrown at a target, with the loss of the court dances and the
charming Farandole for the peasants? (The inclusion of the second act
entr'acte was justified because we had the Mariinsky orchestra playing
magnificently, with a fine but unnamed violinist - worthy heir to Leopold
Auer for whom this music was first written.).
The general run of mime performance, and the supernumeraries who dress the
stage, seemed numb with tedium. The Virsaladze designs - more truncated than
heretofore - are still beautiful, even if the last act shows us a distant
prospect of the casino at Beaulieu rather than Versailles. But the costuming
needs attention: wigs are increasingly improbable except as examples of what
a bright girl can do with cotton wool; some of the court outfits, still worn
with flair, are risible. The production, in sum, is an unworthy frame for
the company's classic style - exquisite in poise and lightness; the shape of
movement ideal in balance and generosity. The work of the corps de ballet
exemplifies these virtues quite as much as the dancing of the soloists. We
watch, and marvel. Academism becomes highest art.
In Thursday's performance by Larissa Lezhnina as Aurora, the dance was true
and lovely. Hers is an interpretation which combines easiest grace with
something gentle. Never badgering her audience with technique, Lezhnina
dances with a dulcet mastery that is irresistible. Line is pure; the
character is youthful; there is something happily engaging in every moment;
here, indeed, is a young princess, with all that implies of aristocratic
means and femininity. There are moments when Lezhnina shows she can command
formidable resources of skill, but everything is dedicated to Petipa's steps
in their purest form. It is an exemplary reading.
Her Prince was Farukh Ruzimatov. The Kirov has taught us how this role may
be grandly danced. Interpretations by Semenyov, by Sokolov (a marvel of
elegance and technical distinction: on his first London appearance he had to
repeat the coda of his variation), and by the angelic Solovyov, were as
near-perfect as makes no difference. Ruzimatov took to the stage in what
looked a sulky impersonation of Nureyev (another great Kirov Prince). Given
his tangled Medusa-locks and his sniffy expression, Aurora might be forgiven
for thinking she had been awakened by Carabosse. Nor did Ruzimatov's dancing
make much of a case for his princely status. I thought it an unlikely
reading.
The dancing of the Fairy soloists and of the corps de ballet was - in spite
of a sense of cramped conditions - distinguished. I record, for
fellow-admirers of Good King Herod, that there was an outburst of smirking
tots in the first act waltz, all of whom should have been in bed hours
before. In fairness, though, I note that on home territory the Kirov's child
cohorts are quite clearly human, and beautifully trained.
The Kirov Ballet is at the Coliseum, London, until July 31. Programming
varies.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Brooke bites back - Off The Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE game up for the Arts Council? Is Heritage Minister Peter Brooke
attempting to achieve by stealth what his predecessor, David Mellor, failed
to pull off by force?
In a remarkably honest moment, Mellor wondered what was the fun in being
paymaster to the arts if you could not decide how the money was spent.
Brooke, an ingrained politician, would never be so blatant. This week he
gave a ringing affirmation to the arm's length principle. He scrapped most
of the report into the Council's operations that he had paid Price
Waterhouse Pounds 60,000 to produce.
Yet behind the affirmation of faith in the Council there were glimpses of
steel. Brooke wants the Council to be more accountable; he stressed that
there would be occasions when he could act as the conduit for public and
political opinion. And he drew attention to the disquiet expressed by MPs at
the prospect of the Arts Council withdrawing its grants to 10 regional
theatre companies.
The less than subtle hint was that the Council should think again about
cutting its money for drama by Pounds 1m, or 3.5 per cent, next year.
Anthony Everitt, secretary general of the Council, is still holding firm
that the Council must take strategic decisions, must back winners and punish
losers, must encourage the cutting edge of the arts, which it currently sees
as contemporary dance and the visual arts, at the expense of regional
theatres.
But behind the scenes there could be some back tracking. The drama panel,
many of whom were against the cuts, is looking again at the matter. It must
apparently save the money from somewhere, but there are alternatives to
threatening the theatres at Plymouth, Greenwich, Hammersmith, Watford,
Oldham, Coventry and the Bristol Old Vic, among others, with possible
closure. It could cut 3.5 per cent from its grants to all drama clients.
Project funding could be halted. The theatres might be encouraged to survive
by the Council financing visits to them by touring companies to make good
the loss of their home-created productions.
Then, the government may decide not to go ahead with its projected cut of
Pounds 5m in the Council's grant next year, which would take away most of
the pressure on drama. As usual in the arts, compromise, wheeler dealing and
procrastination are back on the agenda.
The most likely scenario is that having shown the Arts Council who holds the
purse strings, Brooke will allow it to continue with its apparent autonomy.
He might even give back some of the Pounds 700,000 he wants the Council to
come up with in savings by October. In return the Council will not create a
scandal by hitting well-loved theatre companies.
One thing seems certain: by choosing a time of reduced budget to switch
money between arts forms, the Council has played into the government's
hands. The Council, not the government, appears to be the spoiler of the
arts. Of course if this was an election year the government would restore
its planned cuts and claim the credit for rescuing the arts. But this is not
 -yet - an election year.
                          *       *       *
Few industries are as bolshie, back biting and temperamental as the pop
record business, so the success of the Mercury Music Prize last year was a
surprise. This was designed to uncover the best British album of the year
and it gave generally lacklustre album sales a definite shot. The winners,
the Scottish band Primal Scream, added 30,000 to sales, pushing its album
Screamadelica above the 100,000 mark, as well as picking up a Pounds 20,000
prize.
From an entry of over 120 albums the judges this year have come up with a
controversial list of 10 to fight for a Pounds 25,000 prize. They have
cocked a snook at the big record companies. There is nothing from EMI,
Warners or BMG on the short list; no mention of nominated albums by Eric
Clapton, Van Morrison, or Paul McCartney.
Artists in the frame are New Order, Apache Indian, Sting, Suede, Stan
Tracey, Dina Carroll, Gavin Bryars, The Auteurs, PJ Harvey and Stereo MC.
Suede have been made the obvious favourite, but a flutter on outsider Apache
Indian, which fuses Indian Bhangra music with Jamaican Ragga, might be
productive.
                          *       *       *
The Mercury Prize is commendable in giving a boost to lesser-known artists
who might have something to offer the public. Can the same be said of the
Turner Prize, which also produced a short-list this week for the Pounds
20,000 it will hand out on November 23 to the British artist under 50 who
produced the best exhibition of the past year?
Two of the four, the two British-born, have not actually shown in the UK.
Hannah Collins, who blows up photographs and prints them on canvas, lives in
Barcelona, while Rachel Whiteread, a 1992 nominee who makes casts of
commonplace objects, works in Berlin. The Laotian Vong Phaophanit, an
installation artist, has lived in the UK for eight years and showed at the
Serpentine. Irish-born Sean Scully did have a Waddington exhibition this
year.
The Turner judges have put themselves in a ridiculous position. Scully, a
painter of the Mark Rothko stripey-colour-abstract school, stands head,
shoulders, and waist-line above the others in terms of achievement, status,
and contribution to art. He is an artist of international stature; the
others are flavours of the month. It would be appalling behaviour to
short-list him and then pass him over. And it would be nice for a painter to
win the Turner: it has not happened since Howard Hodgkin in 1985.
Of course Scully mostly lives and works in the US, but that is just a
reflection on the lack of British interest in contemporary art - a lack of
interest that the Turner has done little to redress.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: The making of a fool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN AMIDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY'S FOOL by Richard Russo Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 552 pages
IT IS not easy being nobody's fool. In fact, for Donald 'Sully' Sullivan it
has turned out to be a full time job. For his entire adult life the sometime
construction worker, sometime philosophy student has been able to keep the
residents of North Bath, New York, from making a fool of him. Unfortunately
in the process he has managed to alienate just about everyone he knows.
Richard Russo's remarkable third novel is about the few weeks in Sully's
60th year when he finally decides to let down his guard and let in some of
the people he has been keeping at bay.
For all his headstrong independence, Sully has precious little to show for
himself. He lives in a barely furnished apartment in the house of Miss
Beryl, a common-sensical widow who has had Sully's measure since she taught
him in the eighth grade. Sully's neurotic ex-wife dropped him 30 years
earlier, moving as far uptown as you can in the claustrophobic environs of
North Bath. His son Peter lives in West Virginia, still smarting from
Sully's decision to walk away from him as a boy and avoid the potential cap
and bells of fatherhood. And his married lover, Ruth, has just about had it
with him as well, thinking with some justification that if a man at 60 is
not prepared to settle down then he probably never will.
So Sully spends his time with the few people who will have him - his
woebegone and odoriferous co-worker Rub, the butt of countless jokes; his
drunken, one-legged lawyer Wirf, who tries with scant success to keep Sully
out of trouble; and his womanising boss Carl Roebuck, whose wife Toby is the
true apple of Sully's eye. Their protracted drinking sessions at the local
bar are hilarious set-pieces, scruffy jewels of buffoonery and smart-aleck
dialogue.
Sully's independence is sorely threatened over the Thanksgiving and
Christmas holidays of 1984, however, when Peter returns to town, escaping a
troubled marriage and a ruined career. To his surprise and initial horror,
Sully is forced to be both the father he never was and the grandfather he
hoped never to be, helping Peter and his own troubled son Will land on their
feet. In the process, he comes to terms with the ghost of his abusive
father, Big Jim, whose constant belittlement of the boy Sully might be the
cause of his lifelong pigheadedness.
Nobody's Fool is big, funny and richly human, a garrulous book that button
holes you in the first few pages and does not let you go until it has had
its say. The town of North Bath is a wonderful creation, the sort of place
where Texan investors choose not to build a theme park because, well, the
people there look sort of funny. It is a place of beautiful old houses
occupied by widows who refuse to die simply for the sake of a property boom;
of doomed civic boosters who will run off with S &amp; L funds at the drop of a
hat; of middle-aged Lotharios and their fading cheerleader mistresses. Like
Garrison Keillor, Russo is able to show small-town life warts and all. In
fact, half the time he makes you think it is nothing but warts.
And in Sully Russo has created a character you cannot resist - as long as
you are reading about him and not related to him. He is 'the uncontested
master of the futile gesture' and a 'case study underachiever', the sort of
man people think could have been so much more, though they could not say
exactly what if pressed. But just when the reader is at the point of getting
fatally exasperated with Sully, Russo shows the real pain that has caused
him to be the way he is. Sully's conversion to his own rough and ready form
of responsibility is both comic and strangely moving. In the end, he learns
what most people know and he should have known all along - that everybody
has to be somebody's fool.

EAST OF WIMBLEDON by Nigel Williams Faber Pounds 14.99, 374 pages
IN THE KINGDOM OF AIR by Tim Binding Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 374 pages
KISSING THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS by Peter Michael Rosenberg Simon &amp; Schuster
Pounds 14.99, 235 pages
THE CENTRE OF THE LABYRINTH by Philip Lloyd-Bostock Quartet Pounds 16.95,
472 pagews
BRAVE OF Nigel Williams to write a book about English Moslems, poking fun at
the eccentricities of a religion not noted for its sense of humour towards
British novelists. Brave, but not blasphemous, so the mullahs need not be
alarmed. There is nothing in East of Wimbledon to get them issuing fatwas or
burning the book in the streets. It is just a gentle dig at the oddities of
Islam, as exemplified by the activities of a group of Dharjees - loosely
based on a real Shiite sect - who prowl London's better-class suburbs,
threatening death and damnation to anyone who has the temerity to get in
their way.
The plot revolves around Robert Wilson, an unemployed and rather feeble
Englishman who fakes a conversion to Islam in order to get a job at
Wimbledon's Islamic Independent Boys' Day School. The school is run by Mr
Malik, a disgraceful reprobate whose interest in drink and women is not what
a headmaster's ought to be, especially a Moslem headmaster's. Among the
pupils is Hasan, a blind 10-year-old 'prophet' - again based on a real
Islamic character - who the Dharjees believe is destined to appear on earth
one day and save the world.
So far, so Evelyn Waugh. But the author's approach is more PG Wodehouse than
anything, Wodehouse combined with a fair measure of slapstick and farce of
the Carry On kind. There are mad Irishmen here, dog murderers, Moslems with
tea towels on their heads, old ladies helped on their way to Paradise by a
No 33 bus. The Radcliffe Camera triggers a joke about photography, and the
failure of anyone to murder Robert Wilson for a reward of Pounds 10 is
promptly followed by a raising of the blood money to Pounds 12.50, but still
without result.
Williams' humour, in other words, is a little forced in places, rather more
forced than is welcome. He pitches his wit at the undergraduate level and
hits the mark as often as not. But one cannot help feeling that he would
have written a better book if he had suppressed the urge to amuse all the
time and simply allowed the jokes to arise naturally from the writing, as
they surely would have done if he had had enough confidence in himself and
his past achievements to let it flow.
Tim Binding has no past literary achievements to fall back on, being a
first-time author and a former publisher to boot, but he has not let that
stop him. In the Kingdom of Air is a most interesting book, albeit flawed in
one or two respects. It tells the story of a young man growing up on the
Medway, and of his affair with a teenage girl named Stella, who disappears
one night, never to be seen again. The police suspect the young man of her
murder and question him endlessly. However, they have no evidence and let
the case drop. Many years later, the young man's sister spots Stella at a
London railway station and follows her home. Gradually the truth emerges
about Stella's disappearance.
It is an intriguing story, neatly put together, although the structure is
rather too complicated for what is in essence a fairly simple plot. The
author fights shy of dialogue and writes paragraphs of prose that go on for
pages at a time. But he has a definite talent nonetheless, one that will
doubtless serve him well in future years. What a pity he has already wasted
so much of his life as a publisher.
It is not a bad week for first novels. Peter Michael Rosenberg's Kissing
through a Pane of Glass was runner-up for last year's Betty Trask prize - a
greater recommendation than it might at first appear - and is about love, as
Trask awards have to be. In particular, it is about a young man's passion
for a beautiful girl he met in India, a girl with a mysterious past.
The story begins unpromisingly at Sussex University, where the young man is
learning everything he can about sex. Since he is not in the least
good-looking, this is an uphill task. But just when one is thinking that
there is only so much one wants to know about an unattractive youth
searching for sex on the south coast, the story switches to India, where he
has gone after graduation. There he meets the beautiful Liana, who promptly
surrenders her virginity to him within a few hours of their first meeting.
Well, we all have our fantasies. But there is method in the author's
madness, as soon becomes apparent. The madness in fact is Liana's, because
she is seriously disturbed, and it becomes the hero's mission in life to
take care of her and protect her from herself. The story is a moving one,
skilfully told, well worth persevering with after a hesitant start.
Philip Lloyd-Bostock's first novel, The Centre of the Labyrinth, is also his
last, the author having died of Aids seven years ago. Indeed, he was still
working on the book when he died. It is a highly intellectual work -
Lloyd-Bostock was an Oxford don with an interest in semiotics - which begins
by charting the relationship between a beautiful heiress and a homosexual
photographer, and ends not altogether surprisingly with the photographer's
discovery that he has Aids and is going to die.
People in a similar situation may well wish to read the book and empathise.
If they do, they should be warned that it is not a particularly easy read,
partly because the author still had plenty of corrections to make, but
mostly because he wrote like an academic in the first place, which is not
always the best of recommendations for a novelist, even one with as large a
vocabulary as Lloyd-Bostock's.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: Unresolved conflict, attitudes to war - Martial
fervour, fear of invasion, a gate to utopia / A C Grayling explores people's
changing view of battle over the years

<TEXT>
WAR MACHINE by Daniel Pick Yale Pounds 19.95, 292 pages
AT CHRISTMAS 1792 Edmund Burke attacked the French revolution in a
passionate speech to the House of Commons. Pulling out a dagger and hurling
it to the floor, he cried, 'It is my object to keep the French infection
from this country; their principles from our minds and their daggers from
our hearts]'
Burke's martial fervour is reported in Daniel Pick's compelling study of
attitudes to war during the last two centuries. The account of Burke's
speech is given by Richard Cobden, an indefatigable opponent of war because
it harms commerce and hinders progress. But as Pick shows, Cobden was one of
the 19th century's few unequivocal adversaries of war. Some quite
extraordinary nonsense was written on the subject by his contemporaries,
extolling war's virility-promoting, racially-purifying, creativity-enhancing
virtues.
Pick's book explores these views, drawing on a wide variety of literary and
polemical sources. And he introduces us to some aspects of our own recent
past - the fear of invasion through a Channel Tunnel, for example, and the
increasing prominence of mechanistic metaphors for war  - which were
important factors in the shaping of recent history. The list of thinkers who
saw war as necessary, desirable, or both, is a dismayingly long one.
Carl von Clauswitz argued that it is war alone that gives a nation its place
in the world, while simultaneously purging its people of 'effeminacy and
degeneracy'. Proudhon regarded war as part of the very constitution of human
identity. Engels was uncannily prescient in his vision of modern war,
predicting terrible violence in which millions would be slaughtered and
Europe laid waste. Like Cobden but unlike Clauswitz, he regarded war as
ungovernable once begun, and unstoppable until it burns itself out; but he
nevertheless thought it has a place in the dialectic of progress, because it
is the way capitalism will destroy itself, thus opening the gates to utopia.
Some readers will be surprised to find Thomas de Quincy and John Ruskin
among those who romanticised war. It is startling to find the peaceful
author of The English Mail-Coach describing war as a 'physical necessity'
for man, and arguing that it 'purifies and redeems itself' by bringing
greater evils than itself to an end. In this latter respect de Quincy is
right; the war against Nazism was necessary in just this way. But
unfortunately the 'evils' de Quincy had in mind were not of that order. He
meant England slipping behind in the colonial race for raw materials, or
suffering disadvantages in the jostle for world pre-eminence.
Both de Quincy and Ruskin bemoaned the modern mechanisation of war. For them
it meant the passing of courtly conflict, the end of chivalrous jousts
between knights under fluttering banners. There is no romance, they both
daintily opined, in mass extermination in the mud. Ruskin especially had a
Pre-Raphaelite view of war; once, he wrote, it was a sublime enterprise, in
which 'Every man put on a crown, when the band of flute-players gave the
signal for attack; all the shields of the line glittered with their high
polish, and mingled their splendour with the dark red of the purple
mantles.' Combatants were sanctified by struggle, from which rose all that
is highest in culture. 'There is no art,' said Ruskin, 'among an
agricultural people, if it remains at peace. There is no great art possible
to a nation but that which is based on battle.'
Such nonsense was, however, harmless in comparison to eugenic theories of
war. Darwinism led some to treat it as a mechanism of natural selection. A
British general, Sir Reginald Hart, applauded war's 'extermination of
inferior individuals and nations'. Heinrich von Treitschke argued that war
is compassionate because it rescues the weak and feeble from their misery.
Fortunately such notions did not go unchallenged. GF Nicolai argued that war
is in fact dysgenic, because the fittest and best march off to slaughter,
leaving the unfit at home to father children.
All this constitutes only part of a richly absorbing book. Pick considers
much besides, including British fear of invasion, as exemplified in the
intense opposition which met revived proposals for a Channel Tunnel.
Invasion stories proliferated, portraying the danger of cut-throat French
soldiers creeping through the tunnel by night. Metaphors of rape abounded:
the French, complained the fearful, wished to protrude their steel tube
under England's girdle of virgin sea.
The book ends with a discussion of the correspondence between Freud and
Einstein on the question, 'Why war?' Einstein had pacificist yearnings;
Freud in reply was pessimistic about the prospects for ending human
conflict. In their somewhat stilted exchange of views the dilemma of war,
and the problem of violence's deep roots in human nature, remain unresolved.
If they had been able to read Pick's book, they would have been mightily
helped in their deliberations.

The missing name in your library of great Italian masters of the
quattrocento may well be Fra Filippo Lippi, writes Patricia Morison. Few
books have been devoted to this marvellously distinctive and beautiful
Florentine painter, and none in English. Jeffrey Ruda's Fra Filippo Lippi:
Life and Work with a Complete Catalogue (Phaidon Pounds 95, 560 pages) fills
the gap admirably, if expensively, with clear and unpretentious text and
many beautiful illustrations such as that pictured above: 'The Madonna and
child with the Birth of the Virgin and the Meeting of Joachim and Anna.'

A DIFFERENT SEA by Claudio Magris Harvill Pounds 12.99, 104 pages
BENGAL NIGHTS by Mircea Eliade Carcanet Pounds 14.95, 176 pages
COMMISSION by Finn Carling Peter Owen Pounds 14.95, 120 pages
FICCIONES Jorge Luis Borges Everyman's Library Pounds 6.99, 188 pages
CLAUDIO MAGRIS' last book to be translated into English, the widely
acclaimed Danube (now available as a Harvill paperback at Pounds 7.99), was
part fictional speculation, part anecdote, and part an intellectual and
literary history of the Danubian lands and therefore of the idea of
mitteleuropa as a whole. Spasmodic, arresting and oddly illuminating in its
details, it managed to be both minute and vast at the same time.
His new work, a novel - though its level of scholarly detail seems to
suggest that it is striving to be intellectual history too - is as small as
the other was large. This time it is a tiny corner of the Danubian empire
that Magris explores through his narrator, Enrico, a disenchanted resident
of the Austro-Hungarian city of Gorizia.
Enrico, philologist and desiccated intellectual, flees to Patagonia in 1910,
and is pursued in his life of wandering by memories of his schoolboy friend,
the philosophical Carlo, who represents a kind of ideal to the rootless
Enrico. By the time he returns to Europe in 1922, a new world order is in
place and Carlo has committed suicide. Thereafter Enrico, who never quite
succeeds in conquering desire by the application of intellect alone, finds
himself at the mercy of historical forces that he would choose to rise above
 -fascism, nationalism and Titoism.
It is a novel of great intellectual ambition, exercised within a small
compass, but fails because Magris has not succeeded, for all his scholarly
credentials, in breathing life into the central character.
At the turn of the 1930s, Mircea Eliade, the Romanian philosopher of
religion and sometime fascist, was living in India, and his early novel of
these years is a lively and sympathetic, though often intense and febrile,
narrative of a bumptious young man's voyage of self discovery.
A young European arrives in India possessed of a pioneering spirit; he
believes himself the bearer of civilised values. Unfortunately, he soon
becomes hopelessly entangled in a mesalliance with an under-age Bengali girl
from a Brahmin background. The consequences for both are catastrophic.
Eliade shows an acute sensitivity to cultural differences; how excessive
displays of human feeling can be so unwelcome in a culture that exalts
dispassion above all things; and how the two young people, separated by
violence when their feelings for each other can no longer be hidden, become
tinged with elements of Untouchable mythology. An excellent tragi-comedy of
cultural manners.
In Commission, by the Norwegian novelist Finn Carling, a nameless man living
alone on the island of Corsica receives an unexpected commission: to write
the biography of a young man who has either committed suicide or been
murdered in Singapore. Who is this man? And why has he, of all people, been
given such a task?
The novel takes the form of a detective story. The nameless writer, at first
repelled by the intrusions into his own desolate, self-absorbed life of the
relatives and lovers of the dead man, gradually acquires a passion to learn
the truth. And, little by little, the fragments of his own begin to assume a
more meaningful shape. A compelling, though characteristically spare and
laconic, piece of Nordic fiction.
This month Everyman's Library has added to its excellent list of 20th
century classics two collections of short stories by the Argentinian writer
Jorge Luis Borges, The Garden of Forking Paths (1941) and Artifices (1944)
under the collective title of Ficciones. Like other titles in the revamped
library, the book represents excellent value for money, and not only
includes a full and fair account of Borges's life and intellectual history
but also provides a separately chronology which lists, in a series of
tables, the principal events of 20th century world and South American
history, the major works of 20th century fiction, and the publications of
Borges himself. (We see at a glance, for example, that in 1949, the year in
which Borges published his second major collection of stories, The Aleph;
Simone de Bouvoir published The Second Sex; George Orwell Animal Farm, and
the Berlin blockade was lifted).
Borges, that master of the shortest and most playful of narratives, a
supreme juggler with ideas, is at his best in some of these stories: in the
lamentable tale of Ireneo Funes, for example, who, as a result of a terrible
accident, has a memory capable of total recall. His life is overwhelmed by
useless and inexhaustible detail.
A writer, any writer, Borges seems to be saying (though he would never have
admitted to it), needs the skill to know how to deal with facts in fiction -
too much reality can all too easily overwhelm the unreality of art. Claudio
Magris might reflect on this story.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: What price a Czar after Communism?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CARVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NICHOLAS II EMPEROR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS by Dominic Lieven John Murray Pounds
19.99, 304 pages
IN FEBRUARY 1991, six months before Communism collapsed, I stood in the
Peter and Paul Cathedral of what was still then Leningrad. There was a large
hole being dug next to the line of tombs holding the remains of Russia's
rulers. 'For Nicholas II,' a fierce young student explained, 'And with God's
help we'll soon see a Czar crowned here again'. At the time this had about
all the apparent likeliness of a Jacobite fulminating in Westminster
Cathedral.
Lievan, an LSE don specialising in late Imperial Russia, has written this
biography in the light of Communism's recent collapse: no longer are the
Romanovs the pariahs they once were. The dustbin of history is now crammed
with the cadavers of former consigners.
There is a certain amount of fresh archive information here but not enough
to justify another biography. The interesting part of the book is the new
perspective and the insights that flow from it. Lievan's last chapter, 'Then
and Now', where he weighs up the Romanovs and Nicholas II in the light of
Communism's collapse, contains stimulating ideas and should have come at the
start of the book. Since capitalism won in the Cold War, the late flowering
of an industrial and mercantile culture under Czarism now looks healthier,
he argues, than the State-run artifices which replaced it under Lenin and
Stalin. The concept of three waves of 'modernism imposed from above' which
Lievan perceives in Russia's history is sound and insightful.
Lievan counters the usual canard about the Empress Alexandra's pro-Germanism
by bringing out the intense Englishness of her character. It was Nicholas
and Alexandra's very lack of Russianness which so alienated them from
fashionable upper-class Petersburg. The pusillanimous refusal of Nicholas's
cousin, George V of England, to grant the deposed Romanovs visas for England
leaves the author with 'a somewhat sour taste In the mouth' - perhaps the
greatest understatement in an understated book.
It was the disastrous Russo-Japanese war which lost the Romanovs their
autocracy and their legitimacy, and the even more catastrophic First War
which destroyed both them and their dynasty. Nicholas was certainly at fault
in precipitating the former, but the latter he saw clearly as a grave menace
and tried to avoid with all his power.
This chapter of history is by no means closed. The Yeltsin era may yet come
to be seen as Kerensky-in-reverse, a republican interregnum between
Communism and a full-blown return to Czarist-style, right wing, Russian
nationalist autocracy. Many would say Yeltsin already has many of the
hallmarks of a new, absolutist Emperor in embryo.

FT  24 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Home is the sailor, right by the sea -
A selection of berths on land for those who like to mess about in boats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE whose passion is messing about in boats, and have the money,
buying a house or flat close to their vessel can make good sense. But avoid
marinas if you are a sailor who prefers to be alone.
For the clubby, however, Moriconium Quay, a new development around a yacht
basin at Poole, Dorset - which Savills is marketing - could be ideal. The
first stage sold quickly and the second-stage apartments come to market in
September (although some have gone already).
Prices are Pounds 129,000 or Pounds 135,000 for 125-year leaseholds but,
unlike the houses in the first stage, do not include berths. These (also
leasehold) cost Pounds 35,000 for a boat of 11 metres (36ft) or Pounds
40,000 for 13 metres (42.5ft), which is good value when spread over several
years.
A similar project in Dorset is Priory Quay at Christchurch, near
Bournemouth; there are two units left at Pounds 235,000 - but these do
include a berth (with an annual service charge of around Pounds 800). Black
Horse is selling them on behalf of the developer, Portman Homes.
At Sandbanks, overlooking Poole harbour, the two-year-old Beach House has an
unusual design and a private beach. Three agents (Fox, Norris &amp; Owen, and
Black Horse - Canford Cliffs office) offer it at Pounds 495,000.
In Sussex, Jackson-Stops at Chichester is asking Pounds 385,000 for
Moonrakers, a 1934 house at Bosham, on Chichester harbour, with slipway and
jetty. At Brighton Marina, Fox, in Haywards Heath, is selling units at
Roedean House for Pounds 375,000. This is new on the market and all buyers
get a 40ft mooring for Pounds 1,224 a year - which they must pay even if
they do not keep a boat.
If a marina is too communal, Bar House on the Helford river in Cornwall is
the antithesis. The seven-bedroomed property, which includes a small beach
and boathouse with slipway, once belonged to Claude Worth, a pioneer of
modern small-boat cruising who wrote Yacht Cruising (1910) and Yacht
Navigation and Voyaging (1927). Jackson-Stops in Exeter is seeking Pounds
600,000-plus.
Another Cornish property with boathouse and slipway is at Restronguet Point
on the Fal estuary. Called The Boathouse, it is priced at Pounds 420,000
from Miller. Five houses along, Carrick Cottage is Pounds 20,000 cheaper; it
has a slipway but no boathouse.
A further Boat House (with slipway) is available in the village of Portloe
for around Pounds 270,000, while 3 Mulberry Quay, on the inner harbour of
Falmouth, offers use of the private quay and dinghy davit; price: Pounds
165,000. Both are from Miller.
In south Devon, Stratton Creber is selling the white-painted Rock Cottage in
Newton Ferrers; it has a garden with 120ft frontage to the Yealm estuary and
steps down to the foreshore, where the dinghy can be beached. Price: Pounds
175,000.
Gales can be a problem around the south coast, of course, but they are not
usually a worry on canals. At Bradford on Avon, eight miles from Bath, Logis
Homes has developed St Katherine's Quay to offer a base on the Kennet and
Avon canal for Pounds 49,950 to Pounds 129,950 (through Gratton Palmer
Snell).
At Braunston, near Daventry in Northamptonshire, Stepnells is developing
Brindley Quays. The basin has plenty of space for berthing narrow boats
(around Pounds 1,200 a year for a typical 50-footer) while a 1792 dry dock
remains in use. Houses will be ready later in the year for Pounds 129,750
(through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley).
Somewhere between canalside and seaside is the Georgian Red House on a
tributary of the river Great Ouse at Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire. This
red-brick property has many bedrooms, a boathouse and a riverside studio.
Price: Pounds 245,000 (from Carter Jonas).
The Landmark Trust, meanwhile, is asking Pounds 1.25m for The Limes, an
imposing house built in 1720 and overlooking the Thames from Mortlake High
Street, west London. Turner painted the house twice in 1827; both pictures
are in the US.
The trust bought the property as an investment and has refurbished it. It
now wants to find a sympathetic buyer in order to raise money for saving
other buildings. Three agents are handling the sale: DTZ Debenham Thorpe,
Hamptons and Martin Campbell.
Further information: Black Horse, Canford Cliffs (0202-707364) and

FT  24 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Market progress slows, say agents -
Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPERTY market's progress slowed in June, with net sales 5.8 per cent
down compared with May, the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index reports.
Contracts exchanged rose marginally, but are still down in comparison with
March, which has been the peak month for business in 1993.
Confidence in the government was stronger then than now. And even if the
recovery is under way, the spectre of higher taxes in the Budget in the
autumn is still a dampener.
Estate agent John D. Wood reports that its February-April quarter was
profitable but the previous six months had been the worst for more than 20
years. It had a pre-tax loss for the year until April 30 of Pounds 291,000,
down from Pounds 497,000 on the previous year.
Savills, however, has turned a Pounds 1.44m loss into a Pounds 2.86m profit,
on the year to April 30, selling twice as many houses in London in the
second half-year as it had the year before.
THE ORANGERY, in Mamhead Park, seven miles from Exeter, is an octagonal
pleasure-dome said to be by Robert Adam.
Originally it was a temple or water house. In the last century it became a
gardener's cottage, but now it is a most sophisticated rural delight with
two bedrooms, in 46 acres with views over the Exe estuary. Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, in Exeter, (0392-433033) will sell it by informal tender on August
12. The guide price is Pounds 325,000.
Also new on the market is a thatched cottage by John Nash, a picturesque
change from his stucco cottages in Regent's Park in London. Home Farm at
Burley on the Hill near Oakham in Rutland is on high ground and has five
bedrooms, a walled garden and a thatched game larder, and the original plans
are in the Leicestershire Records Office. Humphrey Repton commissioned this
curio of architectural history as part of his work at the big house. Clegg
Kennedy Drew in Stamford (0780-52788) offers it at Pounds 375,000.
BUCKLAND HOUSE, near Faringdon, in Oxfordshire, is a Georgian villa built
for the Throckmorton family by the famous Bath architects, John Wood father
and son, on strict Palladian lines, with a central block linked by passages
to octagons.
One was the library and the other served as a Roman Catholic chapel. The
house has fine plasterwork and chimney pieces, and a big white-tiled area
below-stairs, but will be costly to repair. The purchaser might wish to
restore its 18th century aspect by demolishing the parts added for a planned
visit by Edward VII, which never took place. The price for two lots is
Pounds 1m, from Cluttons (0865-793900).
Next door is the Tudor Manor House turned into Strawberry Hill Gothic-style
stables by the Throckmortons in the late 18th century. Cluttons hopes for
Pounds 275,000 but, as with the big house, redoing it will be expensive. You
can walk straight from the downstairs rooms into the loose boxes without
going outside.
IN BEVERLY HILLS, California, 822 North Roxbury Drive was the home of
Marlene Dietrich. The solidly built Art Deco building was built in 1928 and
influenced by styles from ancient Egypt (in the aftermath of finding king
Tutankhamun's tomb). The director Joseph von Steinberg chose it for her in
1931, complete with a very large living room, a large kitchen, a large pool
and a cellar that held 5000 bottles. Rita Hayworth lived there later.
Sotheby's International Realty in New York (800-848-2541) and Stan Herman
and Stephen Shapiro in Beverly Hills (310-274-9494) are agents. The price is
Dollars 2.495m. (Pounds 1.66m).

FT  24 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Mooring charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO spend their leisure time on the water quickly find there are
plenty of hidden extras such as insurance, supplies (including paint for the
boat), repairs, membership of a club, and harbour dues.
Berthing charges are probably the heftiest item, though. Swinging moorings
on a buoy in the harbour or estuary are cheaper than renting a berth in a
marina; but for such a lovely spot as the Beaulieu river in Hampshire, they
are still pricy, with an annual charge of Pounds 42 a foot plus VAT. For a
typical 30ft boat, that is Pounds 1,480 before you raise a sail.
Marinas are dearer, even though some prices are reduced slightly from last
year and could come down further in 1994. Lymington Yacht Haven in Hampshire
charges Pounds 2,908 for a 30ft boat, to include everything except
electricity, while Swanwick at Hamble, Hampshire, is Pounds 2,820 (at Pounds
80 a foot, down from Pounds 82). Brighton Marina is cheaper, giving a 20 per
cent discount on the list price of Pounds 225 a metre (including VAT) which
makes Pounds 1,710 for the 30-footer (9.5 metres).
On the Isle of Wight, Cowes Yacht Haven has a two-tier system, with
provisional charges for October 1993 to March 1994 of Pounds 45 a metre, and
for April to September 1994 of Pounds 170 a metre, both plus VAT.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Fashion: Strictly for consenting adults only - Avril Groom
moves among those wealthy few who will always say 'toujours couture'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAUTE COUTURE, say the doom-mongers, is an outmoded industry sliding
gracefully towards its inevitable demise. Yet at least 500 people find it
necessary to be in Paris twice a year for each of the 20 shows, with the
full catwalk works, estimated to cost up to Pounds 1m a time.
In this topsy-turvy world, only a tiny percentage of these are clients. The
rest, who create the often hysterical fantasy which surrounds the shows and
who provide an entertaining fashion show in themselves, are there for many
less direct reasons. In 1993 who can say honestly that an haute couture
fashion show is relevant to their lives?
Certainly not the clients, who number perhaps only 3,000 around the world.
Nowadays haute couture is so politically incorrect that it is something worn
between consenting adults behind closed doors. The places where it survives
are in areas less sensitive to criticism - the Middle East, Japan, Hong Kong
and South Korea (the newest market to be courted) and those parts of the US
and European society still cushioned by vast wealth. The clients are in a
closed system populated only by similar individuals and they make their
choice at small showings as private as the subsequent fittings.
A few celebrities and clients do 'come out' in the glare of the flashbulbs.
No one knows, or dares ask, if they are actually buying or just looking. It
may be a favour to the designer, adding to his celebrity-count and his
publicity, which is what a couture show is really about.
Thus, Mrs Mick Jagger emerged on the catwalk this week at Dior where, as
Jerry Hall, she used to model regularly. A bewigged Joan Collins appeared at
Chanel, Paloma Picasso played the field and le tout Paris went to Yves St
Laurent to offer the fragile designer their support. At Balmain, Pamela
Harriman, the US ambassador, and a sprinkling of her big-spending
compatriots, thought it politically correct to turn up for 'their boy',
designer Oscar de la Renta.
In France it is acceptable for politicians' wives, such as Mesdames Chirac
and Pompidou, to go to shows like Dior, which is an institution, and Chanel,
which they wear. The wife of Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, is a Nina
Ricci customer but only, it is said, for ready-to-wear.
Royal guests are the biggest coup. Last season Dior claimed Princess Michael
of Kent. This season the Princess of Wales did not appear at Chanel, where
she is said to be a couture client, and we had to make do with a gum-chewing
Prince Albert of Monaco.
Real clients do exist but are thin on the ground. Versace's staff were well
satisfied with the '10 genuine private clients' scattered discreetly among
the high profiles like Elton John and Roman Polanski. At Ungaro, British
names such as Hambro and Goldsmith do not appear in the front row and enter
and leave anonymously.
But if clients often shun the shows, their place has been more than filled
by the press. The army of photographers, a jostling bunch wielding big
lenses, metal camera boxes and wearing multi-pocketed combat jackets, has
created the myth of the supermodel, recording every move of, as the Chanel
soundtrack had it, the 'million-dollar derrieres'.
Amid the organised chaos backstage at Chanel, the tension was highest among
those keen for the perfect shot of designer Karl Lagerfeld on his tour of
inspection or Claudia Schiffers's curls being pinned in place. Cameramen
undertake not to photograph the girls changing yet they snap away on the
catwalk at outfits with only a strip of chiffon hiding the same girl's
modesty.
The photographers are abetted by the fashion writers, who turn any change in
design direction or a hint of scandal into a newspaper story. A rumour that
Karl Lagerfeld was introducing the micro-skirt at Chanel produced headlines
even before his pelmet skirt reached the catwalk. The irony is that, in its
attempt to stay afloat, couture is now returning to making what customers
might buy rather than making the fashion headlines, which are the proper
province of the ready-to-wear collections.
What to wear, to assist in this spectacle, is a journalist's dilemma. Very
few can either afford or want the clothes, preferring avant garde
deconstructionism. The variations produced by British journalists on long
black layers and sunglasses are amazing. The international hackpack are
determined down- dressers, and even grand dames such as the International
Herald Tribune's Suzy Menkes, champion of Christian Lacroix's enormous
jewellery, and American Vogue's Anna Wintour, high priestess of short, sharp
Chanel, have reduced themselves to simple severity.
Head girl of the press pack is Denise Dubois, chief press officer of
couture's governing body, who does not dress down at all but always appears
elegantly attired in an outfit by one of the designers whose interest she
protects so efficiently.
Dressing up is the preserve of guests from the trade, the wives of fabric
manufacturers and accessory makers, boutique owners and store buyers from
around the world, to whom the show is a treat that also informs them of
their master's design thinking. They always turn up in his latest
ready-to-wear collection. At Lacroix, the philosophy is if you cannot afford
the clothes, wear the jewellery - and as much as possible. The uniform is
the short suit, whatever one's age and shape, so one mustsuspend one's
critical faculties. British women are often quoted as the world's worst
formal dressers but a couture crowd scrabbling for free champagne and
canapes is only marginally more stylish.
Then, of course, there are the hangers-on, who have no real reason to be
present except to see and be seen and whip up hysteria about the divine
clothes. They may be a friend of a friend of the hairdresser or a fashion
student whose former college chum is now a workroom assistant. Their
prerequisite is to look exotic and clap loudly.
The designers are the other key players in the couture game. Beatrice
Keller, Versace's Paris assistant, says the show is: 'Essential as something
for Gianni to aim for, a way of seeing how all his ideas work together.'
Asked on French television how couture could survive la crise, Christian
Lacroix said that designers 'must fight the recession by making couture even
more unique compared with ready-to-wear so its customers find in it a value
they cannot get elsewhere.'
He is quite right. The gap between couture and ready-to-wear has never been
bigger. Avant-garde ready-to-wear is experimenting with long lengths and
ideas that challenge the accepted construction of clothes. Couture has gone
back to short because it knows that is what its customers like. Lagerfeld's
micro-skirts have it both ways, providing the publicity and, by their
perfunctoriness, allowing the customer to concentrate on the subtleties of
the perfectly-fitting jackets which are the collection's real backbone.
Couture has gone back to its roots of fit and detail - the curvy box-pleated
peplum at the back of a Balmain jacket, the simplicity of a Dior pants suit
or a strappy Givenchy jumpsuit under a spencer jacket. The detail comes with
the fabric, especially for evening: Versace's crushed silk and slashed panne
velvet mixed with lace; Lacroix's antique and devore velvets heavy with
braid and beading but contrasted with delicate chiffon, lace and even woven
leather; Dior's mixture of pleated shot velvet, old gold chiffon and
sumptuous brocade; and Ungaro's moth-wing mixes of shimmery velvet, chiffon,
chenille and fine beading.
Such details, which are the heart of couture, are rarely discernible from
the raucous broad canvas of the catwalk. Only the customer really knows such
intimate pleasures, and that is as it should be.

FT  24 JUL 93 / How To Spend It: At last, the perfect shirt - Lucia van der
Post finally tracks down an elusive fashion classic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYBODY WHO has ever searched for the perfect white shirt will know what an
elusive little number it is. If the cotton is perfect then the collar is
wrong. If the collar is right then, nine times out of 10, the cuffs are too
mean or the sleeves too narrow. And if everything is perfect then chances
are the price is too high.
When I last went hunting for the perfect white cotton shirt (in February
last year), looking for one where every single detail, from the placing of
the seams, the choice of buttons, the quality of the cut and the stitching
had been scrupulously attended to, it took quite a trawl but I did
eventually find one. It cost Pounds 100 - a sum that in my view verges on
the improper for something as simple, as basic, as everyday as a plain white
shirt.
Anybody who is still on the trail might like to know about Workshop.
Workshop sells nothing but shirts - overshirts, tie-shirts, collarless
shirts, striped shirts, pirate shirts, what it calls 'the ultimate big
shirt' - you name it, Workshop sells it. And in there among the more
colourful numbers is what I think is the perfect white shirt. Although in
our photograph, as in the catalogue, it is lime green, it also comes in
plain white as well as khaki, flame, fuchsia, lilac and navy. Crisp,
beautifully cut with good generous double-cuffs, it costs just Pounds 45.
Mostly Workshop sells by mail order - its full-colour, beautifully
illustrated brochure is available by calling 071-498 5878. Each shirt
arrives beautifully boxed and Workshop promises to despatch all orders
within 72 hours of getting the order.
Other shirts to look out for are the 'ultimate big shirt' - in linen as well
as cotton, it comes in a brilliant blue as well as green, rose, purple,
yellow, white and khaki and sells for Pounds 69.95 in linen and Pounds 39.95
in cotton. There is also a collarless overshirt made from a herringbone
weave linen/cotton mixture of beige and grey with a matching shorter
waistcoat that is perfect summer city wear - cool, chic and could be teamed
with trousers or skirt. Pounds 145 for the pair (they are only sold
together).
For those who want to see the shirts before they buy there are now two shops
 -20 Regent Street, Cheltenham GL50 1HL and, the latest addition, Workshop
at 52 Bow Lane, London EC4M 9ET. Both stock all the shirts in the catalogue
and also a few extra designs, too.

LYNNE FRANKS, doyenne of the public relations world, believes that colour is
important.
She explains that the purple of the paint work and sofa in her office is the
colour of spiritual receiving, and that the pale green of the walls provides
energy. The frieze of white convolvulus, after Georgia O'Keefe, which runs
from side to side of the office was suggested by 'dowsing' to balance energy
levels.
Franks aims for a relaxed and comfortable place where clients will unwind,
colleagues feel able to express their anxieties, and her charitable
interests may be discussed profitably. She talks of the atmosphere of her
office conveying the 'balanced woman, with career and family life in
equilibrium'; of it being a place in which to 'be centred, and feel good
in.'
It is a high room, top-lit and without windows. It could be a daunting
space. However, with designer Ben Kelly she has made an environment which is
stimulating, friendly and relaxing.
She has no formal desk but uses a glass-topped table on an antique stand
pushed into the corner. She talks with people sitting on one of two sofas:
the day I visited there was a terracotta vase of catkins on the coffee
table. A glass screen by Danny Lane stands behind, and the walls are covered
with family photographs.
Personal and professional mementos are displayed on a wooden shelf running
beneath the frieze.
It is very much a living-office, without a computer terminal or paper
storage and with just a refrigerator sitting against the wall. I asked
Franks whether the lighting, from translucent orbs hanging from the ceiling,
provided the right atmosphere at night. She said she was not there then, so
it did not matter.
She uses the boardroom for formal meetings, sitting on an orange, scarlet or
fuchsia Arne Jacobsen chair at a glass-topped table by Tom Dixon,
asymmetrical on a miniature space frame.
Everywhere Kelly has used colour and materials in exciting ways, converting
this garage in London's Harrow Road into a corporate office which impresses
such clients as Coca-Cola, Lloyds Bank or the pop singer Annie Lennox.
The door to Lynne Franks's office is never closed, and for much of the time
she is out on the floor with her account executives.

LORD YOUNG spends much of his working life talking to people in his office
in Cable &amp; Wireless's headquarters in Theobald's Road, London.
The restoration of this 1950s building by architects Austin-Smith Lord is a
model of how to convert an old building into something both memorable and
technologically advanced. The architects have succeeded in providing a
building which is discreetly opulent but still workmanlike. With only 3
metres between each floor, introducing services and information technology
required extensive drilling through beams and a cat's cradle of structural
stiffening.
The building has sophisticated networks (and fibre-optic cabling)
throughout. There are an internal video phone system, E-mail, and three
video conferencing rooms. Exchange rooms in the basement keep the place in
touch with the company's world-wide telecommunications interests.
Lord Young sees his office as an 'environment which relaxes; it does not
stand up and hit you.' As his 80-year-old mother exclaimed, it is 'an office
with a sofa]' In fact there are two sofas, both covered in aquamarine
leather.
Young is a tidy, 'clean desk' person, keeping action papers in front of him
until they are dealt with and passed on to his secretary next door. 'Papers
on the desk are my conscience until I get rid of them.' He does not believe
in desks, with drawers where things get put away and forgotten, and in the
past has operated without one altogether. Here he has a table, the only
problem being that computer cabling forms an unfortunate 'fifth leg'.
Young is becoming minimalist - 'individual objects look good' - and dislikes
clutter. The few objects displayed include a statuette from the Solomon
Islands, a present, to 'ward off enemies and keep away evil.' Two fine
painting by Ben Johnson, with their infinite perspective, provide a valuable
feeling of depth to the space. 'They expand the horizon and might almost
have been painted for the room.' There are photographs of grandchildren, and
next door, in the boardroom, an array of cartoons published during his time
in government. A red dispatch box on a side table is also a reminder of that
time.
It is a light room with windows on two walls, double glazed, and with
venetian blinds to control glare and to mask an unattractive roofscape. The
curtains have a geometric design and contrast with the pale aquamarine
walls. Low voltage spots and lamps illuminate the room at night, and though
Young would have preferred indirect lighting with dimmers, he finds the
system 'all right.' This is a living room in the fullest sense of the word,
in which he spends time working: the 'sort of office where you might have a
CD player, except that I would listen to music and not work.'
It is a modern and functional living room although very different from his
homes, both of which are furnished traditionally. He believes the office
should be a contrast: that a traditionally furnished office can imply a lack
of efficiency, and would be particularly unsuitable for someone operating in
his technological world.

FT  24 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Office gossip, how the power brokers work
and play - Santa Raymond, a practising architect and interior designer,
looks at the offices that three movers and shakers have created / Gary
Withers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANTA RAYMONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARY WITHERS' office is an eyrie in the apex of the Imagination building in
London's Store Street, over the front door. It has views across to Tottenham
Court Road and towards the University of London's Senate House, and a
balcony at the back overlooks the airy atrium. The pitched roof is glazed,
with light controlled by venetian blinds.
Withers's professional life is very varied. One day he might talk to graphic
or interior designers and architects, the next he may see writers or film
makers about projects ranging from promoting Ford cars to building a castle
at EuroDisney. This complexity is reflected in his working space. From the
double-height living area a spiral staircase leads up to a working gallery.
Here files are piled high, overflowing on to the floor: 'A secretary's
nightmare, but all in current use.' Conceptual work, internal meetings, and
dictation take place up here.
Downstairs is used for more formal meetings, some client presentations, and
entertaining.
At night the lights - low-voltage spots and up-lighters - can be turned
right down to give 'a quite different atmosphere with really moody
lighting.' A fire burns within the marble fireplace and there is a Bechstein
baby grand. There is a complicated sound system, but no computer: 'I can't
stand computers,' says Withers, 'though of course the rest of the building
is full of them.'
Windows here, as elsewhere in the building, can be opened and heating is
surprisingly by night storage heaters: 'Cheaper to install. Cheaper to run.'
The furnishings are eclectic, a mixture of ancient and modern, chosen by
Withers himself with extraordinary speed.
The cool functionalism of chairs by Charles Eames and tables by Eileen Gray
is contrasted with ornate antiques, carved and gilded mirror and side
tables, marble bases and decorative flambeaux from France. With black and
white photographs on the walls (some in-house and some by Mapplethorpe),
black sofas (copies of some at Blenheim) and black tables, the only colour
is from some original sketches for a 1930s clothes catalogue in gouache and
charcoal.
There is a nice rhythm between a round timber mirror over the fireplace
(carved by Norman Simpson), the circular window (externally the fulcrum of
the facade), walnuts in a great glass jar, and some oversize spheres of
lavender (by Robert Day). Colour in the rest of the building comes from
photographs of projects all over the place. Otherwise, colour is restrained:
white walls, beech and chrome elements, dark grey carpets, grey
workstations, black files.
Architects, Herron Associates, designed the conversion of this building,
originally a Victorian school, in close collaboration with Withers. It
illustrates perfectly the effect of a good partnership between a dedicated
client and talented designer.
These are exciting and practical interiors which serve well the needs of the
organisation while showing clearly the ethos of this design and
communications company: flamboyant, theatrical and yet timeless; simple and
direct, underlined with quality.

GARY WITHERS, of the public relations company Imagination, Lord Young,
chairman of Cable and Wireless, and Lynne Franks, the public relations
consultant, all work in offices which express clearly the culture of their
businesses as well as their personalities and preferences.
Although the businesses with which Franks, Withers and Young are involved
are technologically sophisticated, the primary work of all three is
face-to-face communication.
This is reflected in the design of their offices. None of them is setting
out to impress from behind large desks. Each office is comfortable and
unpretentious, a place in which people may be encouraged to talk openly and
effectively.
Withers is himself a designer by trade, Franks has worked with her designer,
Ben Kelly, over many years, and though Lord Young only came in on the design
process when he joined the company half way through the building works he
has 'no hang ups about talking with designers.'
Each has had a highly creative relationship with their designer, and for
each the result has been an office which fits them as individuals, and which
portrays to colleagues and visitors the essence of their company culture.
Here, in a nutshell, is how their offices help them succeed . . .

FT  24 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A bit of history fights to survive - Common
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE centuries those who work in and around the City of London have had
a plethora of good food suppliers on their doorstep.
Meat from the butchers at Smithfield, fish from Billingsgate, and a little
bit of everything under one beautiful roof at Leadenhall Market.
But while property values and changing buying patterns have already forced
changes on Smithfield and Billingsgate, further changes in the City of
London are making survival precarious for Leadenhall Market traders. A
shortage of retail customers and financial pressures on the market's
traditional big spenders, the managers of company dining rooms, mean empty
and unlet shops in Leadenhall for possibly the first time in the market's
history.
This is a shame, but there is still a wide variety of quality foods
available from the 600-year-old market: fruit and veg from W Baxter, meat
from R S Ashby, fish and oysters from Ashdown's, flowers from A Booth:
plenty of watering holes - the New Moon, the Lamb Tavern (with a magnificent
Victorian tile mural of Sir Christopher Wren planning the Monument) - as
well as an Oddbins wine shop and English, French and Spanish restaurants.
Poulterers met at Leadenhall as early as 1321 and were joined by the
Cheesemongers in 1397. By 1411 it was a flourishing market for fish, meat,
cheese and corn and survived the Great Fire of 1666. Its present striking
structure was created by Sir Horace Jones in 1881 for a mere Pounds 99,000.
A late 19th century drawing in the entrance to Beauchamp's restaurant shows
the market busier than any modern superstore - with every man in a top hat
or bowler and every woman in a bonnet.
Those were the days, cries Edward Blackett of Ashdowns, the third generation
manager of the family fish business. With rent and rates now over Pounds
100,000 per annum, profits from fish, that most perishable of comodities,
can be elusive. And the last decade has brought fundamental changes to the
way the market operates.
The first happened gradually. Since the early 1980s corporate entertaining
has come under the scrutiny of company finance directors. Out, in
cost-cutting exercises, have gone in-house catering staff, and in have come
catering companies who buy centrally, often from wholesalers with much
cheaper premises. The boom of the 1980s disguised this but the crash of 1987
marked not only Ashdown's best trading year but also the beginning of the
market's decline. In 1989 shops started to close and, in 1991, H Blankley,
the oldest shop on the market (opened in 1881), closed. The sites are still
vacant.
The troubles of Leadenhall's closest neighbour, Lloyd's of London, have also
made trading more difficult, but it is the very close ties to the City - for
centuries Leadenhall's lifeblood - which make it unable to profit from any
economic upturn today.
Other food and drink retailers report their best day's takings on Saturdays,
with increasingly more people shopping on Sundays and bank holidays - just
when Leadenhall Market puts up the shutters. It is only open 248 working
days a year and bank holidays mean red ink for the market's monthly trading
figures. In April and May this year it was only open for 20 and 19 days out
of each month. Additionally, there is no point in offering late night
shopping - the City worker has gone home. And, while Leadenhall Market
should certainly be on any visitor's itinerary, tourists are unlikely buyers
of fresh salmon, beef or dressed crab.
The busiest site today on the market shows how much its customers have
changed. On a corner stands Croissant Express where, incongruously, an
almost entirely Asian kitchen brigade fills baguettes, pours cappucinos and
bakes croissants and pizzas for City folk who stand to eat looking up at the
market's arcades. Above the pizza oven history intrudes. Up a narrow
staircase is a small office in which Pickwick would have felt at home.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Gardening: Sow the seed of next year's triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE just bought a pale yellow Day Lily, pot-grown and over-priced at
Pounds 3.95. It is growing in a peat compost which bounces like a tennis
ball when you drop it. It mops up water and it is not going to like the
great outdoors.
Why buy it, then, in the first place?
I blame impulse and emotion. It looked good at the time, paler than my own
Day Lilies which turn out to be the same variety, the excellent Hyperion. It
aroused my sympathy for the nurseryman (until he turned out to have bought
in the plants from Holland); it satisfied my sudden paranoia that I would
have nothing left in flower by August. Above all, named Day Lilies cannot be
grown from seed. If they could, I would follow the advice in this week's
column and set about sowing them myself.
Beginners and occasional gardeners should not be frightened. The next two
weeks are a critical season for good sowers. For the cost of a single Day
Lily, you can sow three or four types of border plant, grow them on and
reckon to move them to a permanent home next spring.
Choose your varieties carefully; you need a seed box for sowing and time for
brief supervisions during three weeks. Two or three more boxes will suffice
for the first transplanting when you space out the first show of seedlings.
Then, you need a patch of bare ground where the soil can be broken down to
receive the transplants in late September. A watering can with a fine rose
is essential, but the weather is wonderfully in your favour this fortnight.
Unless you choose awkward starters, you will be amazed by your own successes
next year.
Where should you begin? In late July, I have to suggest that you start with
my most-noticed border plant in these weeks after the first roses. It is
listed as Salvia sclarea Turkestanica, but county ladies used to know it as
Hothousemaids, because of the bodily smell from its leaves. Like all the
seeds which I mention, it is offered by Chiltern Seeds in Ulverston,
Cumbria, which offers a service by post to credit card holders (tel:
0229-581137).
After a sowing in 1992, this Salvia has just peaked at 3ft or 4ft, but its
mauve and off-white flowers continue to look pretty in its dying months: I
even have a white one. Nurserymen seldom sell it and if they do, they ask up
to Pounds 3 for one plant. It is best grown as a biennial and is magnificent
in dry climates.
In this wet weather, seed can be sown into shallow drills, made by pressing
the back of a garden rake into lightly-broken soil to a depth of about a
quarter of an inch. Cover the seed and press the ground lightly with the
rake: within a fortnight, this Salvia will be showing above ground. If the
weather turns dry, water it daily. If you expect a dry August, sow it in a
box and keep it damp.
Next spring, you can transplant the fast-growing seedlings into borders and
reckon that they will flower in July. This year, I moved some big plants
which were in bud in late May, but they all defied the books and
transplanted wonderfully. The trick seems to work if you water heavily for
two days before moving it.
This salvia has an admirable cousin, the sky-blue Haematodes, which looks
exquisite at Sissinghurst in early July. Chiltern Seeds sell it too and, in
this case, the housemaid has cooled down. Like its cousin, it is almost
full-proof so you can try it and find out if you are a fool.
At the same time, try sowing the lovely Apricot Foxgloves, sold by Suttons
or Thompson and Morgan, and now in major garden centres. Foxgloves are
child's play from seed, and very good for morale. They, too, can be moved
around just before they show buds: the apricot forms do not always stay true
to their original colour after their first season.
All these plants allow the scattered informality which distinguishes a true
garden from a garden made by numbers and designed neatly in blocks on paper.
As the white roses fade, two of my other white protections against formality
have been at their best.
Both have flowers on long stems for which nurseries will charge you up to
Pounds 2.50 per plant. The taller is the white Verbascum Chaixii Album which
looks admirable for a fortnight in flower and then fades so badly that even
a lazy owner would dead-head it. Greater quality is the claim of the white
form of Campanula Persicifolia which grows extremely easily from seed and
has wonderful stems of open, cup-shaped flowers. I am also a devotee of its
near relations, the Balloon Flowers, or Platycodons. Gardeners seem to have
forgotten about these lovely plants.
For less than a single Day Lily, you already have the theme of a series of
summer flowerbeds. You do not yet have my favourite of the week. Gaura
lindheimeri is just starting to open, grown from seed and showing a mass of
pink-white flowers like a better sort of willow herb. It grows like cress
from seed and can either be sown now or under cover next February. It will
then flower in 1994, just when the garden needs some relaxed, informal
touches of off-white. Gaura is not always completely hardy in British
winters: it would be magnificent in warmer European gardens, but few seem to
know it: at Pounds 1 a packet for 50 or more seedlings, who cares if this
lovely touch of informality sometimes fails to make it to the following
summer?

FT  24 JUL 93 / Cookery: The fruity thrills of summer berries - A party
piece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT the first scarlet flush of summer fruits is over, the thrill of
eating berries pure and simple is not quite what it was. Pudding menus
progress naturally from the unadorned to the more elaborate.
The first raspberries and strawberries call for nothing more than a sifting
of sugar and a squeeze of lemon.
Later, perfect fruit are served on a bed of coeur a la creme or junket or
almond milk blancmange. Any that are lightly bruised or too full blown are
crushed for fools, brulees and ice-creams or packed into bread-lined basins
for summer pudding.
If the weather turns goose-pimple cool, cherries, currants and berries can
be tucked under a blanket of almond crumble and baked, or they can be warmed
and spooned over buttery fried slices of brioche.
Another favourite of mine is red fruit jelly. This is, in effect, a summer
fruit salad softly set in its own juices. Strawberries, raspberries, red,
white and blackcurrants, cherries, tay and loganberries, apricots, peaches,
nectarines, blueberries, blackberries and mulberries can all be included,
but redcurrants are the best basis for the jelly, jewel bright and agreeably
sharp.
The simplest, and I think the best, way to make it, is in a large glass bowl
from which it can be spooned for serving. The bowl shows off the stained
glass colours. It spares the cook the unnerving job of unmoulding and it
means that little setting agent is needed so the taste of the fruits shines
through.
Served with creme fraiche and home-made sponge fingers maybe, it makes a
good choice for Sunday lunch or a supper party.
Sophisticates may consider it too nurseryish and may want to smarten it up.
By all means use a long loaf tin to make it, unmould it, slice it for
serving and call it 'terrine of summer fruits' if you will. More gelatine
will be needed, however, or your creation may split and collapse
ignominiously when turned out. The following party piece might be safer.
SUMMER SAVARIN (serves 6-8)
This is as easy as pie using a food processor and easy-blend yeast. Harvest
Gold is the brand of yeast I like best as it contains no unnecessary
additives. It is not widely sold but is always stocked by Safeways. Fill the
savarin just before serving with 1lb-1 1/2 lb summer fruits (say  1/2 lb
each raspberries, sliced peaches and stoned cherries) gently tossed in 2
teaspoons each sugar and lemon juice.
For the cake: 6oz unbleached white bread flour; 1 tablespoon sugar; a large
pinch of salt; 1 teaspoon or 3 grams (half a sachet) of Harvest Gold
easy-blend yeast; 3 eggs, broken up with a fork; 5 tablespoons hot milk; 3oz
butter.
For the syrup:  1/2 lb sugar; 3 tablespoons lemon juice.
Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a food processor. Stir in the yeast and
process briefly to mix. Pour the eggs through the spout while the machine is
running, then add the hot milk gradually, and continue processing until you
have a smooth rich batter. Cover it and set it aside until doubled in
volume.
Dice the butter, melt it and beat it throughly into the risen dough. Turn
the mixture into a well buttered and lightly floured savarin tin or ring
mould measuring about 9in in diameter. Cover and leave to prove in a warm
place until the mixture three-quarters or more fills the tin.
Bake the cake at 200'C (400'F) gas mark 6 for 25-30 minutes until golden and
springy to the touch. While it cooks, make the syrup: melt the sugar in  3/4
pt water and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon
juice.
Let the cooked savarin rest in its tin for a few minutes then unmould it
carefully on to a shallow dish.
Baste it immediately with the lemon syrup, pouring it on spoonful by
spoonful. The cake should drink it up thirstily, gradually absorbing almost
every drop, so the crumb ends up sated and slightly soggy.
Shortly before serving, when the savarin is quite cold, spoon the fruits and
their juices into the well of the cake. Serve alone or, preferably, with
creme fraiche.
Sainsbury has just introduced a low-fat version for the calorie conscious.
It is not at all bad but only a ghost of Sainsbury's marvellous original own
label creme fraiche. I would opt for half quantities of the full-fat version
every time.

<DATELINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL, GILES MACDONOGH and JANCIS ROBINSON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE fifth year in succession Champagne will be faced with a large
vintage and, unless bad weather intervenes, a very good one. It will be
picked several weeks earlier than usual - within the first 10days of
September. In view of the very high level of unsold stocks, the price of
grapes is likely to be lower than last year, which will be decided between
merchants and growers at the end of next month as a recommended figure,
perhaps as low as FFr20 a kilo for the top commune grapes.
EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
Following the decision taken by the EC on June 1 to tax beer at 'factory
gate' strength as opposed to the cumbersome system of original gravity
(which measures potential alcohol), Camra's monthly journal What's Brewing
reports a move made by at least two major brewers to avoid higher duty by
reducing the alcoholic strength of their ales and lagers.
This could also involve an increase in the levels of unfermented malt sugar
in the beer in an attempt to disguise any resulting flavour imbalance. Those
chiefly involved to date are Bass and Courage. The following brands are
affected: Webster's Yorkshire Bitter, Wilson's Original Bitter,
Worthington's Best Bitter and Holsten Pils lager.
One brewer which has not gone in for this sort of thing is Britain's oldest,
Shepherd Neame, in Faversham, Kent. It has not only maintained its good
reputation for cask-conditioned ales, but also been at the forefront of the
revival of good bottle-conditioned beers.
The latest to arrive is Spitfire, a bitter originally brewed to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.
It is a suitably hoppy ale, given Kent's position as the centre of Britain's
hop-farming business.
Spitfire is available in 500cl bottles from Shepherd Neame pubs, priced
around Pounds 1.82, and from select branches of Safeway at about Pounds
1.45. The beer contains yeast and should be poured with care.
GILES MACDONOGH
Owners of the Stratford label blend California wine have been able to offer
better value West Coast wine than most. Majestic, in particular, has been a
good source of their Zinfandel, Chardonnay and Cabernet. But the best buy to
date must be their Pinot Noir, Pounds 4.89 from better branches of Victoria
Wine until the end of this month. I was fooled into pricing it several
pounds higher when served this juicy, rich red. A second bottle might cloy,
but the first should delight both palate and pocket.
JANCIS ROBINSON
Many wine drinkers are intrigued by the idea of becoming wine tasters, but
are reluctant to expose themselves to public ridicule. The Wine Society of
Stevenage (0438-740222) has the perfect answer: eight very different
six-bottle tasting cases which come with a sensible booklet, How to Taste,
tasting sheets, and detailed notes on each case's theme and the individual
wines. Prices range from Pounds 34.50 for the basic assortment, to Pounds
65.75 for six half bottles of sweet wine which constitute 'the best of the
bunch'. There is a Pounds 20 life membership fee.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sleeping beauties - Jancis Robinson unearths
some classics at bargain prices / Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THANK GOODNESS some wine merchants are being pro-active about this
recession. Too many British merchants have been concentrating solely on
improving their range under Pounds 5 a bottle, often rather belatedly - 'Now
let's see, where is this place Oc?' But some have been alert enough to
realise that some of the best wine buys around are of classic wines
desperate to find a buyer.
The most obvious examples of this have been vintage ports, particularly
1983s and 1985s, which have been going for a song at auction and have been
retailed by the single bottle for hardly a couple of songs. Oddbins has had
the delicious Smith Woodhouse 1983 at just Pounds 11.99 a bottle, not much
more than when it was released.
But perhaps the richest hunting ground for fine wine bargains at the moment
is Burgundy, where both negociants and individual domaines are suffering a
severe case of post-opportunism.
Throughout the 1980s these sheltered producers of prototype Chardonnay and
Pinot Noir could hardly keep up with demand. Prices, and yields, rose
accordingly. Many wines, especially whites, came less to express place than
grape variety, contrary to the spirit of France's appellation controlee law.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world's growers of these grapes made rapid
strides in producing wines with more finesse and integrity, but at much
lower prices.
The result is that in too many cases burgundy became over-priced and
under-expressive in comparison with its counterparts elsewhere (particularly
parts of California, Australia and New Zealand, although the New World is
yet to rival Burgundy at its best).
Even more importantly than this, burgundy (a bit like champagne) is
associated with the extravagances of the 1980s, and stocks in the Burgundy
region have been sleeping beautifully, awaiting a wake-up call from the
princely likes of Tony Mason of Majestic, Graham Chidgey of Laytons, and
Robin Crameri of Peatlings. All three have made notable raids on the cellars
of Burgundy, although Chidgey is a particularly veteran campaigner.
Majestic is selling through its wine warehouses 3,000 cases of growers'
burgundies at prices that would have been unthinkable this time last year,
although some of the examples I tasted exhibited some of the faults of some
growers' burgundies: an earthy lack of fruit. Nevertheless, neither their
Bourgogne Rouge 1991, from Mongeard-Mugneret, nor their Bourgogne Rouge
1989, from the Maconnais Domaine de la Chapelle, are to be sniffed at when
offered at Pounds 5.99 a bottle - and the Chablis 1991 is a very respectable
mouthful for Pounds 4.99.
Chidgey has found a clutch of genuinely interesting white burgundies under
Pounds 10, currently available either at Laytons, of London NW1
(071-388-5081), or by the bottle from Andre Simon shops in central London.
Jean-Marie Guffens, the talented and idiosyncratic Belgian whose sky-high
Pouilly-Fuisses have long been sold by Laytons, now has his own negociant
house, Verget, buying in grapes from Cote d'Or vineyards.
Verget's Bourgogne Blanc 1991 is a fascinating hotchpotch of leftovers. The
subtlety and depth of flavour transmitted by fermenting lesser wine on the
lees from various famous vineyards can be tasted.
And Laytons' own Pouilly-Fuisse 1992, made in Ropiteau's cellars, is
tailor-made for those who complain that the punch has gone out of white
burgundy. Both wines sell for about Pounds 9 for a single bottle, or about
Pounds 8 as part of a case.
Perhaps most enterprising is Peatlings' special offer of domaine burgundy,
bottled in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. In an uncharacteristically snazzy
booklet, the wine division of Greene King, the East Anglian brewers, is
offering four red 1991s and three white 1992s at extremely competitive
prices. Here is a rare opportunity for the humble wine drinker to benefit
from boardroom machinations (as Bernard Pinault has done by buying Ch Latour
so advantageously from Allied Lyons).
The wines are the produce of eminently respectable Burgundian sources and
taste delightfully frank and true - most of them genuinely of the terrain.
I found the best white by quite a margin was the Chassagne Montrachet 1992
from Michel Colin's own vines, and was thrilled by all three 1991 reds from
Lucien Boillot: the charming Volnay at Pounds 9.99 for the next year or two,
and the premier cru Volnay, Les Angles at Pounds 11.99 and the
Gevrey-Chambertin at Pounds 9.99 for keeping. The Gevrey is probably the
best buy of all. Peatlings, which has a shop in London EC1 as well as 26 in
East Anglia, is also offering free cellarage of all wines bought through
them - a not inconsiderable incentive.
There are also bargains to be had higher up the scale, and not just in
Burgundy. Farr Vintners, of London SW1 (071-828-1960), has been selling
Bonneau de Martray's famous Corton Charlemagne 1987 at the silly price of
Pounds 150 a case, and has a number of claret bargains too. Meanwhile rivals
Cave Cru Classe, of London SE1 (071-378-8579), has a special offer of
Domaine Ponsot's highly acclaimed 1990 red burgundies, and rivals Turville
Valley Wines, of Great Missenden (02406-8818), and Wilkinson Vintners, of
London NW3 (071-267-1945), are also busy paring prices to the bone.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Sport: Irish chase a Cup that cheers - Yachting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INGENUITY has been the key to the 1993 Champagne Mumm Admiral's Cup. When
the unofficial world championship of yacht racing begins off Cowes next
Thursday, it will be a small, devious field that crosses the start line.
Take the Irish team, for example.
Ireland has been in and out of the AC over the years but never won the
trophy. Thanks to Sydney-based businessman John Storey, the Emerald Isle,
which has previously tended to export its sailing talent, is co-favourite to
take the cup.
Several years ago Storey encountered Harold Cudmore, the Cork-born
professional who skippered Britain's bid for the America's Cup in 1986.
Cudmore showed him that by chartering top boats at exactly the right moment,
one could both block the opposition and 'ride good horses.' Stir in the
visceral willingness of Irishmen who ply their trade in other countries to
fight for the Auld Sod, and one has a winning combination. The first
consequence was victory for Storey/Cudmore/Ireland in the 1992 Southern
Cross series in Australia.
Bitten by the bug, Storey moved on with the svengali Cudmore at his elbow.
Their master-stroke for this campaign was to buy the world champion
two-tonner Shockwave from Kiwi owner Neville Crichton.
Under the procedures devised for the 1993 Admiral's Cup, the points scored
by each team's two-tonner will probably be crucial. As the middle-sized
component of each team, between the one-tonner and 50ft yachts, they should
be competitive across the whole range of conditions. With only the best two
results per team from each race scoring, this is important.
As a class this is likely to be the swansong for the two-tonners. Numbers
are declining and good ones have been stalked and hunted across the world by
would-be Admiral's Cup captains. Britain could not be certain of having a
team until some appallingly delicate negotiations with the Turkish owner of
Prodzza (the former Unibank, of Denmark) were concluded.
Cudmore's 'stroke' - as the Irish would put it - with Shockwave had a
beautiful symmetry to it. As well as giving his team the most powerful
platform possible, New Zealand's sailors were unable to find an adequate
two-tonner and are not competing at Cowes. They have always provided
formidable opposition in previous events. With only eight countries
competing, the field is smaller than since the early 1970s.
Cudmore, sailing for his own country for the first time since 1979, will
skipper the one-tonner Jameson I (ex Fram XI, owned by King Harald of
Norway). Jameson II (ex-Shockwave) is steered by Gordon Maguire and the
50-footer (Jameson III, aka Heaven Can Wait) is under the control of
ex-Whitbread skipper Joe English.
Once this formidable collection of personnel and hardware was assembled,
'King Harold of Cowes', as Cudmore is sometimes known, was able to go to
Jameson, the leading Irish whiskey brand, and secure team sponsorship.
Cudmore had to act like an independent film producer: juggling the studio,
the stars and the bank until they are all safely to hand, pointing in the
same direction.
Britain has had to go through broadly the same process to assemble a team.
It may be no coincidence that team captain Graham Walker has had Cudmore
skipper a good number of his racing yachts over the past decade. Once Walker
acquired the 50ft Indulgence (ex-Juno) earlier this year, it was a question
of building the rest of a team around that platform.
'I'm sure that despite a low number of teams this is going to be the most
competitive Admiral's Cup ever,' said Walker. With a dearth of top-level
racing available around the world, there is absolutely no doubt that the
best boats and top crews are gathered in Cowes. However, Walker is confident
of Britain's chances of regaining the trophy they last won in 1989.

FT  24 JUL 93 / An elegy to young graduates - Summer rites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS more than a hint of the passing-out parade on graduation day. As
they watch their charges march beyond the gentle garrisons of academia, most
lecturers are glad not to be going where the graduands are bound: it is an
altogether rougher place.
Gilded youth is not, these days, uncluttered. The Volvos are out in force,
to gather up the baggage of learning: the TV, the CD, the ice hockey pads,
the mountain bicycle not yet nicked. It is a labour that most parents
undertake gladly, for they see this as a coming of age, of sorts. The hand
that takes the degree waves goodbye to the paternal chequebook. That is how
the arrangement ought to function. Fathers may be seen happily capering
under college portals at the thought of it, though soon, no doubt, some will
find the arrangement only honoured in the breach.
Gilded youth shimmers out to parade through town so as to show local New
Agers and vagabonds what it is to be an Adequately Launched Young Adult.
Thence to a ceremony made numinous by a coalition of three ingredients.
First, it is essentially for the benefit of spectators. Second, it is staged
in such a way that the spectators shall understand none of it (Latin, Welsh
or Gaelic are commonly used, furthering the fiction of dons at ease in all
the ancient languages).
Third, all the protagonists wear the garb of crows or bats. Some carry
floppy black fishcakes on their heads, others sport crests of bright
plumage. As a general rule, the gaudiness of the plumage correlates
inversely to the distinction of its awarding institution.
Once upon a time, a dose of hocus-pocus and a tap on the head with the Bible
was enough to send gilded youth on its way. This is not so now. The
managerial navigators of today's universities have an eye to the future:
graduands are assiduously cultivated from the moment their diploma is in the
bag.
Indeed, they may even be handed their degree certificate in a (heraldic)
plastic carrier bag, which contains all the necessary paperwork for the
imminently prosperous to unload the burden of their prosperity on to the
alma mater. She stands there with open arms, or at least an extended palm.
At some juncture a speech must be made. Whether witty or dull, it must be
portentous. It must mention straitened prospects, reduced circumstance and
hostile forces on the margins of the campus or the cloisters. Latin will not
be used: this is a message that has to get across.
The graduands - and for that matter their great-aunts and younger sisters -
are being mobilised for the advancement of learning. One day, perhaps, one
of them will hold the purse-strings, and since holders of purse-strings
habitually get third-class degrees, the speaker will make a point of
congratulating everyone present, even if they got through three years
without ever distinguishing the university library from the local
fire-station.
Ordeal by sherry or something Liebfraumilky follows. Strawberries pop up, as
they will on such occasions. Stilettos plunging nicely in the learned turf,
mothers who could all be the Duchess of Kent lose their offspring and find
themselves either next to the don with no small talk or the don struggling
with the periphrasis of polite conversation.
'Oh yes, Jason was well to the fore on the rugby field' (meaning: if Jason
ever did turn up to a seminar, it was breathlessly, and wearing repellent
lycra shorts). Or: 'Samantha is something of a rara avis, isn't she?'
(meaning: Samantha, having arrived as a convent-reared English rose, now
trudges around under a pile of matted pink hair and a crucifix through each
nostril).
Ah. To those who have suffered all - mortgage, marriage, equity, negative
equity, marriage again - this ritual, sometimes likened to the processing of
sausages, is hedged about with an elegaic sadness that sausage-makers surely
never feel.
But the sadness is short-lived. Clear the graduates out. Tomorrow, new
applicants arrive.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Geese to keep birdies away: The strange battle over a golf
course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and THOMAS HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARY Holloway does not look like the sort of woman to do battle with a
Japanese golf company. A mild-mannered housewife, she lives in a picturesque
house in the depths of Weavers Down wood, west Sussex, and is happiest, she
says, tending her flock of geese and looking after her garden.
But two years ago she embarked on a campaign that has sent an ominous
warning to the golf world and left a Japanese company embroiled in a bizarre
battle - one that has pitted golfers against ancient common-land rights and
a motley collection of cows, goats and geese.
Weavers Down common, a valley dotted with elegant houses sporting names such
as 'Squirrels', seems a strange place to stage a golf battle. Indeed, when
Kosaido, a Japanese printing group, took over an ailing local golf club, Old
Thorns, eight years ago, it caused barely a stir in the tranquil woods.
Though some locals muttered about the arrival of the Japanese, and the new
shiatsu centre, conference complex and Japanese restaurant which had
appeared at the club, most accepted the new mangement.
The battle started when Kosaido announced that it intended to extend the
course. On paper, this seemed unremarkable. Kosaido, which manages 11 other
golf courses around the world, owned the land, and with golf booming in
Britain there seemed little doubt that it could attract the necessary
business clientele.
But the site was part of the 1.5m acres of common land in England and Wales.
Back in the Middle Ages local houses had been allocated 'estovers' - rights
for wood-cutting and animal grazing. Though some of the 20th century
'commoners' had let these rights lapse, a newly-discovered sense of
ecological outrage prompted the rest to action.
'I think we felt annoyed that they just assumed they could build a new golf
course. We've already got so many golf courses round here anyway,' says
Mary.
Taken aback, the Japanese' first response was to offer a business solution.
In a letter, they offered to buy the rights: Pounds 1,300 for the
wood-collecting rights, and rather more for geese and cattle grazing. But
the commoners refused to budge, and threatened to appeal to the Royal
Commoners' Commission if the Japanese infringed on their grazing rights.
Kosaido then produced a new, environmentally-friendly plan which promised to
let some of the land revert to its original heathland state, and respect its
common land status. After all, it pointed out, other golf courses in England
were already built on common land.
But surely this did not mean that the cows would be allowed to graze on the
golf course? asked the commoners. Yes, replied Kosaido, adding that it all
boiled down to the '4-inch rule.'
'Since free-ranging cattle require grass of at least 4in length around which
to wrap their tongues while feeding,' the cows would ignore the greens, it
said.
But what if the cows wandered across the greens during play? And what about
the geese? 'Geese would love bunkers. And they can make a tremendous pooh,'
chuckles Mary, gleefully. She claims that the commoners had also taken
expert golfing advice which showed that most golfing greens could not
withstand a cattle herd.
Undeterred, Kosaido submitted its application to the local council, arguing
that since it already had permission to build a new hotel, the extension of
the golf course was a necessity.
'We have nothing to say. We certainly don't want any publicity over this,'
Kosaido declared nervously. At this point, though, the commoners discovered
they were not alone in arguing that there were already too many golf courses
in the world.
English Nature, for example, was concerned about the well-being of the
solitary bees and Dartford warblers. And the local reptile society announced
that the land was home to the little-known smooth snake and sand lizard, and
thus a proposed Site of Special Scientific Interest.
'We were rather surprised when they popped out of the grass. We'd never
heard of them before,' says Sam Howes, assistant planning officer from
Chichester District Council, whose task it had been to plough through
100-odd protest letters.
Meanwhile, the Royal Commoners' Commission, whose job it is to decide on the
status of common land, expressed confusion. 'We can only deal with cases
that are referred to us by the county council,' it admitted.
This week, just when the council was due to meet to decide the case - it was
expected to support Kosaido - an 11th hour fax from English Nature,
contesting the status of the access roads through the snakes' habitat,
prompted deferral of the hearing.
The commoners says that if Kosaido wins planning permission at the next
hearing they will take their case higher - and carry on a grazing war on the
golf course with their geese and goats.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Little Tokyo, Golders Green / A look at London's hidden
community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARCUS DALRYMPLE and KATHERINE CRACKNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 10am, just another busy day at Iseya's Japanese supermarket. Mrs
Sasaki, her basket full of packets of sashimi raw fish, noodles, dried
sea-weed, soya sauce, bottles of sake wine and Japanese washing-up liquid,
exchanges pleasantries with the other Japanese housewives as she passes up
and down the aisles.
A typical Tokyo scene? Not a bit. This is Preston Road, Wembley, in London.
Mrs Sasaki and her family are part of a 30,000-strong community of Japanese
in London. Most Londoners are unaware of the Japanese in their midst. In a
city as large as London, it is easy for them to be almost totally hidden.
Once they arrive in London, most Japanese families head for established
Japanese areas such as Wimbledon, Hampstead, Golders Green or Ealing.
'These Japanese enclaves,' says Caroline Javis, who works at the Japan
Centre, 'have everything they need. They have their own schools,
supermarkets, butchers, hair salons, book shops, restaurants and even video
stores. They are so self-sufficient that in some parts of London, such as
Finchley, where there are whole streets inhabited by Japanese, they hardly
need venture more than a short distance.'
The Red Directory, published by Cross Media for Japanese residents, lists
more than 700 Japanese businesses in London, roughly a third of the number
of such businesses in Britain. They range from airlines to supermarkets and
include commercial organisations, insurance companies, legal services,
couriers, language schools, estate agents, restaurants, karaoke bars,
nightclubs, sports centres and newspapers. With so many industries and
services to serve the Japanese, the incentive to integrate is further
diminished.
Sonobe, a discreet Japanese nightclub at 118 Piccadilly, is one such
service. Here, in the centre of London, is a Japanese retreat. But unless
you are Japanese, or you are invited, it is unlikely you would know it
existed.
Established in the mid-1970s by Gordon Marsham - unusually for a Japanese
business, he is an Englishman - Sonobe caters to Japanese businessmen
willing to spend Pounds 100 a night or more entertaining Japanese-style.
Company salarymen visit restaurants and bars in London as often as they do
in Japan. At around 9.30pm, when the organist starts at his electronic
keyboard, in come the hostess girls to keep the whisky and conversation
flowing.
Although 'Mr Gordon,' as he is affectionately known, and some of the
hostesses are English, the rest of the staff are Japanese, including the
mama-san (manageress). In the back, rows and rows of Chivas Regal, at Pounds
22 a bottle, testify to another custom. Each is personally labelled.
While the husbands are working or soaking up Japanese food and nightlife,
their wives are visiting Japanese supermarkets and hairdressers, socialising
with other Japanese women, and cooking Japanese food. The children go to
Japanese schools, have Japanese friends, read Japanese comics and watch
Japanese satellite TV. For some, English flower-arranging and tea at Fortnum
and Mason is about as close as they get to British culture.
Mrs Hashimoto is the editor of the Eikoku News Digest, a weekly newspaper
catering to the Japanese. The reason why the Japanese remain such a hidden
community, she explains, has much to do with the fact that the Japanese are
extremely homogenous, often suspicious of the outside world, of 'otherness.'
'It is often a huge cultural shock for the Japanese to move from Japan and
live abroad,' she says. 'Even in Britain they feel the same social and peer
pressures as they would back home.'
Ms Totsuka is a Japanese psychiatrist living in London. The vast majority of
her patients are Japanese women. 'How can they adjust to life in London?'
she asks. 'They are not encouraged to learn English, they don't make English
friends, their lives revolve around their children and their husbands. Life
in London is a sentence for them.'
There are other reasons why the Japanese in London live secluded lives. Most
are posted abroad for up to three to four years. Inevitably, one of the
biggest barriers to better integration is language, says Mrs Morishita,
director of an English language school for Japanese.
'Although housewives have more time and therefore an incentive to go to
English classes, many feel inhibited about learning and practising English
for fear of it being interpreted as showing off to their friends - a major
social taboo in Japan.'
British employees of Japanese companies have stories to tell which
illustrate this separation of the Japanese community. Joanna Carpenter works
for a Japanese travel agent in central London.
'The office is distinguished by two separate sets of staff, it seems - the
Japanese and the English. Although we all work for the same company, we
hardly ever mix. Even at office parties, the Japanese sit at one end of the
table and we sit at the other. It is almost as if they are not really in the
UK.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Sport: Gather ye rosebuds - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH soccer's short, hot summer came to an early end this week. Across
the Midlands crowds wrapped in sweaters against the chill gathered to watch
an unseasonal spectacle: soccer in July. Their interest in the European
under-18 tournament is a triumph of hope over recent experience.
When England's under-18s opened the 1993-94 season by playing France at
Stoke last Sunday, only 29 days had passed since England's senior team
closed the 1992-93 season by losing 2-1 to Germany in Detroit after a
miserable tour.
Since then, Europe has been in the grip of match-rigging mania: from Warsaw
to Marseilles, from Italy to the Highland League in Scotland, championships
and promotions apparently settled on the playing field have been fought
again round committee tables. It was left to a bunch of 18-year-olds to
restore a little dignity to a battered sport.
One of the most cheering aspects of England's advance to tomorrow's final
against Turkey is the way the team has challenged soccer stereotypes. The
English players have exploded the myth that the country's youth system
cannot produce skill. They have beaten teams who possessed much more of the
traditional English virtues of organisation and physical strength.
National youth teams are unsteady producers of talent. England have won this
competition five times since 1970 yet those teams contained only eight
future internationals, led by Trevor Francis, Ray Wilkins and Glenn Hoddle
but also including John Gidman (whose only full cap was against Luxembourg)
and Paul Walsh (three caps against Australia).
The unreliability of the pituitary gland is one reason. This is a team of
tiny tots. After they beat the Dutch, Alan Mullery, the former Spurs and
England midfielder, said he thought Darren Caskey, who captained the team
with striking maturity, had modelled his play on another Spurs midfielder,
Hoddle. Now, said Mullery, Caskey must follow Hoddle's example and make an
early breakthrough into Tottenham's first team. At 18 Hoddle was already
close to 6ft. I doubt that Caskey, who slipped by in his England blazer as
Mullery spoke, is 5ft 8in. Even so he is taller than several team-mates.
The under-18s are managed by Ted Powell, a former amateur international, but
fall under the aegis of Charles Hughes, the FA coaching director, whose
long-ball evangelism has earned him the contempt of the English press. At
first glance the team's fluid, skilful soccer with short passes and bursts
of dribbling mixed with the longer balls, is a refreshing contrast to the
under-19s, whose rigid tactics made them the ugly ducklings of the spring's
world championships in Sydney. In truth the under-18s are the attractive
face of what Hughes has dubbed his 'winning formula'. It is a team most
dangerous on rapid breaks and at set pieces.
The difference is that Powell does not force his players into a tactical
straitjacket. He trusts their skill and intelligence. They are free to
produce the flashes of genius with which Robbie Fowler, of Liverpool, and
the dazzling Julian Joachim, of Leicester, have ripped open defences.
Powell is a man you would want to coach your son. On Sunday he glowed with
pride as he introduced Fowler to the press. After Tuesday's win he argued
that English soccer places such demands on its youngsters, even
nine-year-olds, that it risks the 'physical and mental burn-out' of its
potential stars. Some of Powell's squad might play 70 games a season. Their
Dutch counterparts play 40 to 45.
Powell's masters at the FA must share the blame. They have not managed to
trim the Premier League and it does not seem to have occurred to them to
reduce the size of the youth and reserve leagues where the youngsters play
so much. The demands of the FA's international teams do not help.
Powell complained that one promising player had turned out for his club on a
Saturday, a Sunday and a Tuesday. Tomorrow's final will be England's fourth
game in eight days. One reason England started this tournament as a rabble
was that Manchester United and Leeds, who between them supply nine squad
members, refused to let their players take part in a warm-up tour.
All those games have one advantage. England's young players are
battle-hardened. They were outplayed by France and Spain but knew something
their opponents did not: how to win. If England's young rosebuds are to
flourish in professional soccer's weed-choked garden when frozen, muddy
winter comes, they will need their thorns.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Dollars 3 notes; Samoan warriors; jungle retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the minor businesses of the Cook Islands - there are no major ones,
though they are trying to grow coffee and vanilla - is the currency. It is
tied to the New Zealand dollar, but is supplemented by some unique mintings
which cannot be used abroad, even in New Zealand. The paper money, designed
by a resident American, includes one of the world's few Dollars 3 notes.
Among the coinage are a 12-sided 50-cent piece, a triangular Dollars 2, and
a wavy-edged Dollars 1 coin featuring the god Tangaroa - naked, and so
well-endowed that Queen Elizabeth II was said to have been extremely
hesitant about appearing on the other side.
A recent component of the Pacific myth is rugby, played hard and fast; and
the current champions are Manu Samoa ('Samoan warriors'), who embarrassed
Wales in the World Cup and frequently contribute players to New Zealand's
All Blacks. We went to watch them play Scotland in Apia. The Scots, tired
and hot, kicked a lot. Manu Samoa, gloriously, ran the ball from everywhere,
and won 28-11. The crowd cheered their three tries but otherwise, though
delighted with the result, were unexpectedly quiet and decorous - closer to
Lord's than Twickenham. More than other islanders, Samoans are a reserved
people.
Eccentric hotel of the year must be Hana Iti, on the Tahitian island of
Huahine. American Thomas Kurth has built a series of bungalows, according to
whim, scattered around a hillside; some are built into cliff faces, others
in or around trees, all partly open to the elements.
No two are the same; four-wheel drive vehicles are the only way of moving
between them. We made the mistake of arriving after dark; for some, the
prospect of a night in a door-less chalet in an unseen jungle was
offputting. As long as you are prepared for the isolation, though, this
could be the unique battery- recharging experience Kurth planned.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Tried Cyprus? - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VINEYARDS, olive groves and orange trees; mimosa along the motorways;
monasteries where monks make wine and nuns make honey; Byzantine churches
and beach resorts - this is Cyprus, the third largest island in the
Mediterranean and divided in two since 1974 when the Turks invaded and
occupied a third of the northern part.
'It's a small country, how can you divide it?' asked a home-sick Greek
Cypriot border guard re-settled from the north as we, in the Greek and
southern half of Nicosia, stared at the rolled wire and bare walls of the
buffer zone that cuts the city in half. Tourists can cross the border; they
need a passport and must return by sunset.
The best way to get around is by car, although there are inter-city and
village buses, as well as service taxis which run every half-hour between
the main towns and can be shared.
Nicosia, the capital, seems to be neglected by all but a few tour operators
as a place to stay. This is a pity, because it is a delight.
Coastal towns in Cyprus do not only have beautiful beaches - they have
chunks of history all around them. Limassol, the island's largest resort and
wine-making centre, has the recently-excavated ruins of ancient Amathus, the
castle of the Knights of St John, dark-sand beaches, a glitzy tourist strip
and five-star beach hotels.
Just outside the town, the spectacular amphitheatre overlooking the sea at
Curium (or Kourion - there are many ways to spell names in Cyprus) is still
used for concerts and plays. A short drive from the harbour at Paphos you
find restored third-century mosaics in the House of Dionysus, the rock where
Aphrodite rose from the sea, and the grotto where she bathed. The practical
traveller in Paphos might also like to know that contact lenses can be
bought there for two-thirds of their UK cost.
'People come to Cyprus,' a guide told me, 'for the good weather, the
beaches, a lot of culture and the antiquities. But to see the real Cyprus,
you must go into the villages where old ladies wear black and men sit around
in coffee shops. It's still a traditional way of life there.'
Houses in small villages, as yet untouched by tourism, are now being
restored and are available for holiday rental, though the Cyprus tourist
authority is treading cautiously and taking local peoples' feelings into
account. Not everyone wants an influx of visitors. If they want to, visitors
can help with grape-picking, wine- and bread-making. A car is essential for
this kind of holiday.
The Cyprus Tourist Office in London (tel: 071-734-9822) offers excellent
free booklets on the history of the island, special interest holidays,
accommodation, nature trails in the Troodos mountains, and a diary of
events. More than 50 UK tour operators feature holidays in Cyprus: for a
complete list and information about activity holidays, contact Greystone
International Publishing (0708-757423) and ask for its free Explore Cyprus
booklet.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Island-hopping through the South Seas - John
Westbrooke watches coconuts grow on the Cook Islands, meets friendly Fijians
and studies serious rugby-playing Samoans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE no such word as 'Pacificism'? Maybe we should invent it, to
describe the hold the South Seas have on our imaginations. 'Orientalism,'
after all, is the way we construct a myth of the east. But the Pacific
islands play as big a part in our dreams of paradise. Just think of Gauguin,
Robert Louis Stevenson, grass skirts, blue lagoons. We need a word for all
this Pacific dreaming.
Tahiti is probably the place most people think of as an island nirvana
(except Americans, who think of Hawaii). Moorea and Bora Bora fit every
requirement: cloud-capped peaks, steep green slopes tumbling to golden
sands, coral reefs with white waves outside and calm pale blue water within.
The natives are friendly francophones - this is French Polynesia, baguettes
and yellow headlights. They beguiled poor Captain Bligh's men into mutinying
so that The Bounty could stay a while longer. Their happy promiscuity had
long been suppressed by missionaries by the time Gauguin was drawn there,
which is probably just as well, otherwise Papeete would be the Bangkok of
the South Pacific. But while women no longer swim out naked to greet sailing
ships, new arrivals at the airport will be welcomed with leis and ukulele
music.
Sometimes it is hard to look on all this natural beauty without wondering
whether tourists do it any good, and hearing in your mind's ear Big Yellow
Taxi, Joni Mitchell's lament for Hawaii: 'You don't know what you've got
till it's gone, They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.'
A common feature of the beach hotels, for instance, is bungalows built
ostentatiously over shallow water and containing glass coffee tables through
which you can watch and even feed vivid tropical fish from the comfort of
your living room. At one such hotel we saw sand being pumped in from the
next bay to improve the beach. Ecologically sound, we were assured; but it
does not seem right.
By way of an awful ecological warning, there are the Bali Hyatt Ruins on
Bora Bora, half-built on a hill when the rains washed the land away and the
money ran out. The Tahitians know their Joni Mitchell, and promise that
their island will not go the way of Hawaii. Bora Bora will not go the way of
Tahiti. Huahine will not go the way of Bora Bora. I hope they are right. And
Hyatt (which denies any connection with the ruins) merits some sort of
sensitivity prize for its Regency Hotel, which clings so modestly to a
hillside outside Papeete you can hardly see it.
FOR an equally Pacific and much less touristy experience, fly a few hundred
miles west to the Cook Islands. In this easy-going backwater people speak
English, drive on the left and wave to strangers; and the towns look like
rural New Zealand. The best hotel in the islands, the Rarotongan Resort, is
nobody's idea of luxury, but it has beaches and island nights where the
vigorous local music and dancing are on display.
And again, you are in blue lagoon country. A day trip to Aitutaki, one of
the neighbouring atolls, must rank high among the world's best: barbecues
under the palms, snorkeling over the coral, white sand between your toes.
There is a prosaic explanation for the palm-fringed beaches: coconuts wash
ashore, and seeds sprout at the high-water mark. Knowing this does not make
them any less idyllic.
Though the islands were named after James Cook, the first Europeans to see
them were Spanish, in 1595. A Spanish Polynesia never developed, but the
notion is a pleasing one: corridas in which matadors throw leis round the
bulls' necks, perhaps, and a redoubled respect for manana. These days the
Cook Islands' main connection is with New Zealand, in a Monegasque
arrangement whereby the islands are self-governing but Wellington provides
defence and a lot of aid.
ANOTHER short flight takes you on to the islands of Western Samoa, which is
a different sort of place. You can see it at once on the airport road, in
the vivid gardens, covered in black rocks, rootling pigs and the occasional
family grave; in the 100 churches in 20 miles; and in the way most people
don't live in houses.
Instead they have a fale - a floor and a palm-frond roof, separated only by
poles. If it is too hot or cold or wet or windy, blinds are let down, but
there are no walls and only basic furniture.
Stevenson lived, died and is buried on a hill outside Apia. Somerset Maugham
(who set Rain in nearby American Samoa) would be at home in the sunny,
slightly seedy capital, too: you might find him observing the crowd in a
bar, while Paul Theroux sits next to him muttering into his beer. He would
be staying at Aggie Grey's, a burger bar which grew into one of the great
colonial hotels and has recently been brightly refurbished.
Western Samoa feels unwestern. People are friendly enough, but Theroux is
not the only foreigner to have found a sort of teasing hostility in small
villages. The country was the first Pacific island to achieve independence,
in 1962, after decades of often oppressive rule by Germany and New Zealand;
and Samoans are proud of it.
But independence comes at a price. Agriculture and fishing provide little
money. The banana trade was brought to its knees by bad weather and erratic
shipping, and mostly lost to central America. Tourism is one of the biggest
businesses, though it is not very big. The locals might look content but
many are unemployed, and remittances from those who leave home are a big
source of income.
Samoans are their own people, but they hold a special place in the western
imagination, too, thanks to Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa (drawn
from American Samoa), suggesting that, for Samoans, growing up could be free
of trauma and sex free of guilt. Her findings have been hotly disputed and
certainly aren't true now, but they are a prime example of Pacificism, the
attributing of a better life to a far-off place.
IN FIJI, you are back with the tourists. Not so long ago Fiji was the dark
side of the Pacific myth. Lots of south sea islanders ate people, but the
Fijians seem to have pursued their cuisine with unusual gusto; startled
visitors had their buttocks fondled as they arrived, to check for fat
content. Bligh passed through these waters, hastily and without landing, the
locals hot on his heels.
But the missionaries were as successful here as anywhere else. Fijians are
now devout Christians, and the singing of a church choir will weaken your
knees. Violence is not unknown - we watched a village rugby match end after
10 minutes, with a man carried off and the opposing team facing suspension
for the season - but tourists are no longer in danger.
If they do not come it may be for another reason: politics. In 1987, the
army overthrew the elected government and set out to limit the influence of
Indians, originally brought in by Europeans to work the cane fields but now
almost outnumbering the natives. Fiji isn't South Africa, and the races seem
to co-exist, but the tensions between them are an unwelcome reminder that,
even in paradise, some angels may be more equal than others.
Liberal travellers are used to seeing locals worse off than themselves (if
you want a wealthy Pacific island try Nauru, the Saudi Arabia of guano), but
the sight of inequality being imposed, and the thought of the military doing
it, may make some of them prefer to holiday elsewhere.
They would be missing something if they did. Hard up against the date line,
Fiji claims to be the first country in the world. The sun pours down. The
people are friendly, without fondling your buttocks. The palm trees are
forbidden to grow lower than the hotels. The reefs teem with lurid fish.
The blue lagoons. . . well, both Blue Lagoons, the Jean Simmons one and the
Brooke Shields re-make, were filmed around Yasawa, a string of islands at
the west end. We stayed at the Yasawa Island Lodge in big, bright bungalows
amid vegetation so lush it was hard to believe it had been devastated by a
cyclone only last January. (The cyclone-free southern winter is the time to
visit).
At the east end of Fiji, famous for its glottal stops, we stopped at Matagi
island, which specialises in diving; you can spend the days among some of
the world's richest coral walls and the evenings chatting about tables and
bommies, or swim under waterfalls on neighbouring Taveuni and look out at
night for the cane toads.
You can fly between islands - atolls look particularly beautiful from the
air - or take a cruise, or stay at a hotel and luxuriate. And whenever you
leave, the locals will sing Isa Lei, the haunting Fijian song of farewell.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Old Plovdiv - an outcrop of history / James
Henderson visited Bulgaria's second city and found it ancient and charming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL travellers have their indulgences, little things to keep them happy when
they are on their own in a strange land, hearing a language they do not
understand, in a fix, half-way up a mountain, wondering where on earth they
are going to spend the night. One thing that I enjoy is taking place-names
out of context, or simply repeating them until they sound ridiculous.
Dazed after four days of ferries, buses and trains shared with Albanians,
gipsies and backpackers, I happened on Plovdiv. It ranks among my favourite
silly-sounding names, up there with Sixpenny Handley and Tit. Repeated by a
tired man, Plovdiv begins to sound absurd.
I travelled to Bulgaria via the capital, Sofia. No absurdity there - the
name has almost a sublime quality about it. It sounds alluring and gentle.
Certainly there is no hint of a hard-line communist capital to it: Sofia
hints at years of accumulated beauty, and of course it speaks of wisdom. Yet
the city itself is relatively modern and not that attractive.
The few remnants of the medieval town have been swallowed by grander and
larger buildings. And the last 40 years have left the place with an
over-abundant acreage of concrete, now liberally used by skate-boarders and
graffiti artists.
Plovdiv sounds like an ugly, tortured mouthful of a town, probably in the
worst communist tradition, a tangle of factories and faceless tenements. It
is Bulgaria's second city. But, again, the name belies the fact. The centre
of Plovdiv is ancient and charming. For no better reason than another
traveller's indulgence, I decided to go and have a look at it.
Old Plovdiv is perched on an outcrop of rock that has given it protection
from passing armies for the last 3,000 years: Thracians, Romans, barbarians,
Ottoman Turks.
It has also had its peaceful moments. The Romans stopped long enough to
build an amphitheatre, which was unearthed in a landslide in 1972. But
Plovdiv's ramparts are coming under threat again, this time from marauding
bus-borne tourists. (Until a few years ago the communist trades unions had
the run of the place). From now on it seems that Old Plovdiv is destined to
be a hill-top redoubt of restaurants and galleries, though for the moment,
at least, people will still let you into their houses to have a look round.
The streets are cobbled and overhung with dark wooden eaves; it is easy to
feel an ancient air. Standing among the trees are heavy brick and wooden
villas, built in Bulgarian National Revival style during Plovdiv's
prosperous period in the last century.
One of the art galleries in this area is devoted to a favourite son of
Plovdiv, Zlatyu Boyadiev. His was a remarkable story. At the age of 40,
after half a lifetime of painting, he suffered a stroke and was paralysed
down his right side, so he learned to paint with his left hand. From an
ordinary painter he turned into one of Bulgaria's best. Intriguingly, his
style changed completely in the process.
A breathlessly enthusiastic guide latched on to me as I pondered the first
room, the only one in the house that exhibits paintings of Boyadiev's early
period (most of them are in the National Gallery of Art in Sofia). At this
stage the artist consciously adopted the style of the Old Masters. The
colours are solid, dark and realistic, the subjects formal.
Then the guide raced me through the rest of the house - an explosion of
colour and unexpected shapes. The artist's technique had loosened up and
resembled more Breughel and Egon Schiele than the great masters. The change
was weird. It was as though he were delving into new areas of his mind. His
personality might have undergone changes in learning to gain control of his
left hand, but it is mind-boggling to speculate how the re-routing of ideas
in his brain might have affected his art.
As a man of no political conviction, life could have been difficult for
Boyadiev in post-war Bulgaria. Unorthodox art such as his was unpopular with
the authorities, and he certainly did not honour the regime in his
paintings. However, he won their respect in his struggle to overcome his
disability and he received the accolade of People's Artist.
Boyadiev would often paint a mountain in his pictures, and my guide sent me
off, past the streetside icon salesmen, to a favourite area of his. Outside
Asenovgrad, to the south of Plovdiv, you will find the old monastery of
Bachkovo, one of Bulgaria's best known. It could be a retreat of quiet and
contemplation, but the bus-borne hordes penetrate here, too.
Bachkovo is set in a cool mountain gorge. Surrounded by arched colonnades,
the courtyards of the monastery are laid with irregular cobbles and planted
here and there with trees. Vines clamber up the walls. In the centre of each
courtyard stands a chapel.
Through an open-air ante-chamber painted with murals I descended into the
semi-obscurity of the church itself. The flagstones were blackened and
covered with ancient carpets, the panelling stained by centuries of smoke
from two or three forests of candles, permanently aglow. There were tiny
windows high up but little light gets in.
On the wall facing me as I entered was a screen of icons; around the walls
were murals. Visitors were milling. Wandering among them were local women in
scarves, lighting new candles in the iron chandeliers. Occasionally a door
would open in the screen of icons and a priest in black robes would emerge
and re-arrange the tables.
I sidled into one of the standing pews with elbow rests around the outside
walls and admired the scene. A shaft of sunlight penetrated the darkness
from on high; lazy swirls of smoke and incense played in the light.
Suddenly I realised that I was in the middle of a wedding. A small group had
clustered around a table in the centre of the nave. Facing each other were
the priest and the marrying couple: she in a white dress, with a green
handbag over her shoulder to match her high-heeled shoes, he in a grey suit.
Behind them were the best man and the maid of honour, each holding a candle.
Two crowns were blessed, kissed by the bride and groom in turn and then
placed on their heads.
They drank from a glass of wine, three quick sips, and then joined hands and
circled the altar, bowing to the points of the compass in turn, three times.
The priest took the candles and the couple blew them out. They all left as
quickly as they had arrived. The women in scarves continued their vigil with
the candles, shuffling from one chandelier to the next. As I stood, the
priest offered me a sip from the glass of wine which had been blessed for
the wedding.
So much for Plovdiv. Silly-sounding, but charming.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: In the cave of the cannibal kingdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDING in a Scottish cannibal's cave with a single lighted match was an
unnerving experience in itself. Discovering my own name scrawled on the rock
was a surreal surprise. Just graffiti, or the menu?
Five hundred years earlier the king's men had stood on the same spot, drawn
there by the gruesome flotsam washed up on the coast at nearby Ballantrae. A
mile inside the cliff they found Sawney Bean and his charming family.
While the legend of Sawney Bean may still be popular in Scotland, finding
the cave is more difficult. Sawney Bean's Cave is a tourist attraction in
the same way that Irish pixies are: nothing on the map, no paths and no
refreshments.
We set out by car from Stranraer along the A77 coast road with the
knowledge, culled from collective local memory, that the cave was 'somewhere
near Ballantrae'. In the village a Scottish mist had drenched the castle and
driven everyone indoors.
At the shop, the woman behind the counter knew what we had to do. For those
who wish to follow, this is what she said. Drive north on the A77 until the
road rises to clear Bennane Head. At the top there is a small car park on
the left. Park here, climb through the barbed wire (where everyone else has)
and follow the path northwards for 50 yards. Be careful: the tourist board
describes the descent as 'treacherous'.
At this point, a giddy few hundred feet below you, will appear a beach of
grey stone. The path drops with sickening speed down to the left and towards
the beach. At the bottom a lorry rusts on the beach. When you reach the sea
turn right and skirt a large rock. Just beyond this is a narrow cleft
leading to the entrance to a cave partly blocked by a boulder. This was the
home of Sawney Bean.
On the day we went there was a tremendous sea blowing and the rain ran in a
black flood down the cliffs. Standing on the beach, and looking up, it is
easy to see how no one ever escaped.
And no one ever did. For 25 years in the early 15th century Sawney Bean, the
son of an east Lothian hedger and ditcher, lived in the cave with an ever
expanding family. By the time the king's men arrived, the grandchildren
(incestuous offspring of Sawney's own) had enlarged the family to 48: a lot
of mouths to feed.
The family ranged widely across the countryside, preying on lonely
travellers and dragging them back to Bennane Head. By the time King James I
arrived at Bennane Head, the number of victims that had made the one-way
journey down the path had (allegedly) exceeded 1,000.
When the king's men entered Sawney's cave, they found a 'ghastly,
gibbet-like larder of human limbs and parts hung drying on the cords and
ropes; and pickled in barrels of brine against the walls were the inner
organs, hands and feet, and still more human flesh . . . '
The family was led, chained in single file, to Edinburgh and imprisoned in
the Tolbooth. A trial was considered unnecessary. The men were dismembered
in public, while the women were forced to watch. Then they were burnt at the
stake.
The journey to their little home is worth the trouble. Standing on the beach
gives you a rare opportunity to imagine what it is like to be lunch.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: For those yet to be converted
. . . - Diesels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND-car buyers who do not consider a diesel are denying themselves the
opportunity to cut fuel costs by at least 30 per cent and make a modest
contribution to protecting the environment. More than 200,000 diesel cars
were sold in Britain last year, most to company fleets. This year, sales
have continued to climb steeply and a total of 250,000 registrations, or
more than 20 per cent of the total car market, is on the cards.
Every kind of car is now available with a diesel engine. Well, nearly every
kind. No maker has yet marketed a diesel-powered convertible or sports car,
although you could call Citroen's ZX Volcane turbo-diesel (a top speed of
118 mph/190 kph) a diesel GTi. And one really must think of BMW's fast and
ultra-refined six-cylinder, 2.5-litre turbo-diesels, newly-arrived in
Britain, as typical BMWs first and diesel cars second.
Diesels save on running costs, not because the fuel they burn is
significantly cheaper than unleaded petrol but because they use so much less
of it. When running below full power - as car engines are for 99 per cent of
the time - and especially when warming after cold starting, diesels can be
spectacularly more economical than petrol engines.
A typical family diesel hatchback - say, a VW Golf, Ford Escort or Peugeot
205 - used almost entirely on short runs of a mile or two may have half the
fuel consumption of a petrol equivalent. Only when driven hard on motorways
do diesels lose some of their economy benefits. Even then, they are still
less thirsty than petrol cars.
Economy over very large mileages once was the only reason for buying a
diesel because they were less attractive than petrol cars to drive, had
basic trim and cost more. None of these disadvantages applies now. Diesel
cars burn fuel so efficiently that they cause less atmospheric pollution
than petrol cars - less even than the latest ones with exhaust catalysers.
A diesel car is noisier than a petrol model at start-up but, after a couple
of minutes, it will be hard - in some cases, virtually impossible - to tell
the difference. And turbo-charged diesels have similar acceleration to
petrol cars; the Citroen ZX actually out-performs some petrol-engined rivals
in the same price class.
Trim and equipment levels are no different, and the hefty price premium once
charged for a diesel has almost disappeared, not least because all petrol
cars must now have fuel injection and a catalyser. The new Citroen Xantia
1.6i petrol and 1.9 diesel are both Pounds 10,895. The cheapest Vauxhall
Cavalier is the entry level 1.7D Envoy at Pounds 10,360, which is Pounds 170
cheaper than the 1.6i petrol.
Reliability is another good reason for buying a diesel as a second car. A
diesel engine has no electric ignition, which removes at a stroke the main
cause of roadside breakdowns.
For starting from cold, a diesel has glow plugs. All you need do is leave
the ignition key in the pre-start position while you fasten your seat belt,
and then turn it to operate the starter. The engine fires instantly and runs
untemperamentally while warming up. (For more than 15 years, my personal
cars have been diesels. None has ever failed to start first time; none has
ever let me down on the road. I cannot see myself ever buying a
petrol-engined car again).
Diesel car prices start at under Pounds 7,000. Among the cheapest are the
Vauxhall Corsa Merit 1.5D, Rover Metro 1.4CD and Seat Ibiza 1.7D, all
three-door hatchbacks. The Corsa's engine is a Japanese-made Isuzu while the
Metro has the same PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) diesel used in the Citroen AX and
Peugeot 106. Most Seats, although not the Ibiza, have Volkswagen engines.
PSA is the leading European manufacturer of small diesels; its 1.9-litre
engines power the Rover 200 and 400 diesels as well as the Citroen BX, ZX
and Xantia and Peugeot 205, 309 and 405.
Although, litre for litre of cylinder capacity, diesels do not develop as
much power as petrol engines, they tend to pull very hard at low
revolutions. In practical terms, this means that a diesel in fifth gear
often will climb a hill that would call for fourth or even third gear in a
petrol-engined car. And the need for fewer gear changes makes for relaxed
driving.
Is there no diesel down-side? Honesty compels me to admit that no diesel
ticks over as quietly as a petrol engine, and some can sound rather gruff
when accelerating hard. But there is no truth in the hoary old myth that
diesel pumps are so filthy that, after tanking up, your next stop is the dry
cleaner.
At modern sites, the pumps are on same islands as those dispensing unleaded
and premium petrols. Disposable plastic gloves are there for the taking. I
never bother and rarely have to wipe my hands on a free paper towel.
Another complaint was that diesel cars were smelly. Yes, they were - but not
any more. Now, the really smelly ones are hard-driven petrol cars with
catalysers which leave a strong aroma of rotting cabbage.
The more you look at the case for buying a diesel second car, the more
compelling it becomes. In the last Budget, all motor fuel duty went up 10
per cent. The chancellor said it would continue to rise annually by at least
3 per cent over inflation. As the running costs of a second car in most
households cannot be set against tax, curbing its fuel consumption will
become progressively more important. There is no better way of doing this
than going for a diesel next time.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Why it can pay to go foreign
 -Financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
SECOND cars normally are bought out of taxed income, which makes first cost
a matter of great importance. So, how can you limit the amount of capital
that has to be invested - or borrowed - to buy what is bound to be a
depreciating asset?
If saving pennies is important, it can pay to think foreign - to faraway
places where cars with strange-sounding names are made. Have you, for
example, ever heard of a Kia, Hyundai, Proton or Sao Penza? Possibly not.
But should you be in the market for a brand-new second car, make a note of
the names.
Kia and Hyundai are Korean; Proton is Malaysian; and Sao Penza, despite
sounding like a minor Portugese saint, is South African. Just to complicate
matters further, deep down they have a lot of Japanese in them.
A Kia Pride is really the former Mazda 121 hatchback (which, incidentally,
was sold for some years in the US as a Ford Festiva. The explanation is that
Ford owns a large chunk of Toyo Kogyo, which makes Mazdas).
Both Hyundais and Protons make use of a lot of Mitsubshi technology,
although Hyundai is pioneering new models entirely of its own design. And
the Sao Penza is a born-again, old-model Mazda 323. Oriental provenance
apart, they also have very competitive on-road pricing in common.
A Kia Pride is a tall, thin car of super-mini size with generous head room,
three or five doors, and a choice of 1.1 or 1.3-litre engines. The controls,
including steering, are light, it rides pretty well and it is cheap - about
Pounds 500 cheaper than a comparable Rover Metro, for example. Prices start
at Pounds 5,499 for the four-speed, 1.1-litre three-door, and Pounds 6,899
buys the longer-wheelbase five-door with a 1.3-litre engine and five-speed
gearbox.
Hyundai's entry model is the X2 1.3-litre three-door with a four-speed
gearbox. It costs Pounds 6,498, which makes it more than Pounds 400 cheaper
than the most basic Renault Clio. But if you fancy driving a sporty-looking
two-door, a 1.5-litre, five-speed Hyundai S-Coupe is quite a bargain at
Pounds 9,938. And an up-market Hyundai Lantra 1.6 GLSi saloon, complete with
power steering and four electric windows, costs only Pounds 10,298,
undercutting the cheapest 1.4-litre Rover 400 (without power steering) by
nearly Pounds 500.
Proton 1.3 and 1.5-litre four-door saloons and five-door Aerobacks resemble
closely the Lancers that Mitsubishi stopped making in Japan several years
ago. All have five-speed gearboxes and power steering, standard on the
1.5-litre models, is a Pounds 350 option on all but the basic 1.3 litre.
Prices start at Pounds 6,990 for a four-door, and even a top-model automatic
Proton Aeroback 1.5 is less than Pounds 10,000.
The Sao Penza is a South African-built version of the old Mazda 323 - the
car that was so similar to the last model Ford Escort that it was even sold
as one in some south-east Asian markets. It has a 1.3-litre engine, five
gears, and is equipped simply. Build quality is up to Japanese standards but
the cost is low - Pounds 6,623 for the three-door, Pounds 6,479 for a
five-door.
There are even cheaper new cars. The rear-wheel driven Russian Lada is based
on the Fiat 124 that died in the 1970s. It is unrefined, but owners say it
is reliable, long suffering and easy to service. (You have only to look at
Russian roads to see why these qualities are much admired back home).
A Lada Riva 1.5 four-door at Pounds 3,905 is a lot of car for the money. If
you do not expect too much - and do not plan to change it too soon - it is
likely to prove good value. The much more up-to-date, front-wheel driven
Lada Samara has its rough edges, too, although the engine (1.3 or 1.5) is
quite sweet and seems tireless.
Prices start at Pounds 4,580 for a five-speed 1.3-litre three-door. At that
kind of figure you cannot really complain about heavy brakes and rather
sloppy handling.
I have saved the best until last: the Skoda Favorit. Forget the jokes about
the old rear-engined Lada (sample: what do they call a Skoda Convertible? A
skip). The 1.3-litre Favorit is a smartly-styled, front-wheel driven
five-door hatchback or estate car.
Volkswagen owns Skoda, and it shows in the build quality. But Skoda prices
remain highly competitive, ranging from Pounds 4,849 to Pounds 6,372.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: The luxury that has become a
necessity - Recession has failed to halt the second-car market, but it faces
another threat from tax changes next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFINING a 'second' car is not easy. Most would, perhaps, see it as a cheap
family runabout, secondary to the company-provided 'first' car. But, in
fact, it takes many forms:
It is the lovingly-maintained classic sports car used only on special
occasions - and then only when the weather is dry.
It is the Range Rover Vogue, dripping with accessories, used for dropping
off the children at their day public school en route to the tennis club - a
four-wheel-drive as a fashion statement. It is the small, open, Japanese
two-seater reviving 1960s' MG memories for nostalgic, middle-aged
businessmen.
Or it is the battered Mini which the caring father drives daily to the
station, leaving the company car for his nearest and dearest
The growth of the second-car market has been slowed, but not halted, by
recession. As bus and rail services continue to decline, so the second car
is becoming a necessity rather than a luxury.
More than a third of households now operate two cars, and more than one in
20 run three. Around 500,000 'second' vehicles, both new and used, are
likely to be bought this year. But the exact cost of running them - in terms
of purchase, depreciation and, particularly, insurance (as a result of
soaring car crime) - is likely to be examined more closely than usual this
year by many families.
Doing so should provide some clues as to what company car drivers should do
when new rules for taxing the private benefit of company cars start on April
6. Many companies already are offering staff a cash alternative to their
company vehicles. But surveys - such as this year's Lex Report on Motoring -
indicate that few drivers have any accurate idea of how much salary would be
needed in lieu.
Since most second cars are bought with private, after-tax income, a close
study of total costs - including finance charges, or interest foregone on
money used for a cash purchase - could make many drivers ponder long and
hard before handing back the company car keys.
That favoured small band of employees which gets two company cars will find
from April 6 that both will be assessed for tax on exactly the same basis,
so that the second car - which is likely to do little or no business mileage
 -will be taxed at the highest rate. The new taxation regime, based on a
simple percentage of a vehicle's cost, will thus hit small pockets of the
second-car market hard.
Because there is no 'cap' on the system, drivers of very expensive cars face
almost unlimited tax bills - an actual cash payment of more than Pounds
58,000, for example, for anyone running one of Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220
sports coupes on the company and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles a
year.
There is also a nasty shock in store for anyone running an exotic classic
car as a second company vehicle. Historically, doing this has been quite
sensible because they were taxed on the basis of original purchase price,
long since slashed by inflation. But next year's tax regime will cover them
on the basis of present market value.
Women now account for 40 per cent of the UK driving population, and most are
making clear they are more interested in value for money than driving
'classics' or what time it takes a car to go from 0/60 mph. This bodes well
for the further rapid growth of diesels in the second-car market because of
their much greater fuel economy compared with petrol vehicles.
Another sector showing sharp sales growth is that for highly versatile
'people carriers.' These high-roof, multi-passenger, multi-purpose vehicles
were pioneered in the US by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Based on
commercial vans, most have long since parted company with their mundane
forebears and versions sold by specialist converters include refrigerators,
videos, televisions, carpets, curtains, sofas which convert into beds,
air-conditioning and even cookers - all at prices that would yield only a
mid-range family saloon to buyers elsewhere. European manufacturers have yet
to take such a bold step, though.
A few years from now, it is possible that the second car - at least, if used
as a local runabout - will be battery-powered. But electric car development
in the UK is lagging behind some continental countries and France in
particular, where low-cost nuclear energy is particularly suitable for
charging electric cars and facilities for this are being set up in cities
throughout the country.
These facilities are aimed particularly at Peugeot and Renault electric cars
to be launched from the mid-1990s. Peugeot estimates Europeans will be
buying 200,000 such vehicles annually by year-2000.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Checks and balances - Buying
second-hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people who buy a private car new know that its value will drop by
Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000 even before they drive it away from the
showroom. That is what happens when the first name is entered in the
registration document. So, it makes financial sense to buy a 'nearly-new'
car instead.
Buying a car is also about image, though - particularly, the image of
ourselves which we wish to convey to others. In the boom years of the 1980s
the desire to project the right image often took precedence over financial
common sense but the recession has produced a cannier consumer who is more
concerned about value.
A recent survey by RAC Motoring Services revealed that more than 60 per cent
of those questioned were considering buying a used car next time 'to save
money.' But this cannier consumer is having an impact on the used car market
already. Prices of desirable, low-mileage models have been rising steadily
this year.
Andrew Wilkinson, senior editor of the CAP Black Book - used by the car
trade as a guide to prices - explains that there is a shortage of cars,
caused partly by the dramatic downturn in new vehicle registrations since
1990 and the tendency during the recession for companies to keep their fleet
cars longer.
He says that ex-fleet cars, even those with high mileages, are 'making very
strong money' just now. And the poor condition of some of these vehicles is
not deterring buyers from paying relatively high prices.
'Even executive and high-performance cars, which in the recent past have
been out of favour and difficult for a dealer to sell at anything but low
prices, have now made a comeback,' Wilkinson adds. Only the 'hot hatch'
models have not been following the rest of the market - although, even here,
prices have stabilised.
Buyers are more confident about used cars because it has become clear that
modern vehicles last well and tolerate high mileages. Neither is rusty
bodywork the problem it was, as manufacturers have taken to using much more
galvanised steel and better production techniques.
A nearly-new car today will usually come with a manufacturer's transferable
rust warranty. While these are complicated and hardly worth the paper on
which they are printed, they are an indication that makers are taking the
matter seriously.
Many cars have transferable manufacturers' warranties, offering genuine
protection against major defects. Some Japanese makes are offering
warranties for three years or 60,000 miles. Dealers often offer warranties
when selling used cars, but some are better than others. If the dealer
offers warranties that do not cover electronics and other expensive items,
you could probably do better buying one from an insurance company.
There are always some risks associated with buying used cars. Astonishingly,
there is no totally reliable way of proving who owns a vehicle. You cannot
rely on the registration document; it shows only the 'registered keeper,'
who might not be the owner. It could be a leased company car. And if you buy
a car that turns out to be stolen, in nearly every case you have no right to
keep it.
HPI Autodata, during test marketing early in 1993, was asked by more than
10,000 people if the cars they were about to buy had a 'record.' Searches
showed there was cause for concern in one-third of cases. The vehicle was
not what it appeared, had been reported as stolen or at risk from theft, was
the subject of an accident write-off, or had outstanding finance.
HPI has data on millions of cars, provided by insurance companies and
finance houses throughout the UK. Recently, it went national with its
information service. Instant data, followed by written confirmation, is
available on used cars registered after August 1986 for a Pounds 15 fee by
phoning 0722-422 422 between 8 am and 8 pm Monday-Saturday.
Another way a buyer can protect himself is to ask for the invoice that the
seller received when buying the car. (In this connection, it is also a good
idea to keep safely the paperwork you obtain). Other documents might help,
such as MOT test certificates and servicing documents.
In any case, a would-be buyer should ask for documents giving the full
service history of a used car. This helps combat another big risk - that the
car might have been 'clocked' (ie, had its odometer turned back). Trading
standards officers estimate that this has happened to 20 per cent of used
cars; the lower the recorded mileage, the higher the price that can be
charged.
Villains are also getting better at repairing cars written off by insurance
companies, welding two or three bodies together to make one so expertly that
only an experienced engineer can spot the deception. The best protection
against this fraud is to ask for an inspection by the Automobile Association
(0345-500 610) or the Royal Automobile Club (0800-333 660). Charges start at
about Pounds 100 but vary considerably depending on the size and complexity
of the vehicle.
The Consumers' Association offers an action pack on buying a used car. This
costs Pounds 4.45 by mail order from PO Box 44, Hertford Z, SG14 1SH, or at
the Which? bookshop, 361 Euston Road, London. It is available for Pounds 9
at other bookshops.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Putting safety first -
Four-wheel drives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU worry about your wife driving the children to school during a wintry
spell? Will your second car be used to take the family to the ski slopes? If
so, you are a prospective buyer of a four-wheel drive.
It need not be one of those rugged, on/off-road machines with high clearance
and knobbly tyres (although, human nature being what it is, it probably will
be). No, what I mean are normal-looking cars meant to be driven on roads,
not across virgin country. The only thing special about them is that their
engine's power is put on the road through four wheels, not two.
Four-wheel drive is all to do with maximising grip. The more slippery the
surface, the less power a tyre can handle before losing grip and allowing
the wheel to spin.
Family cars do not spin their drive wheels on dry roads but may on wet ones.
On snow, sheer lack of grip can bring any two-wheel driven car to a stop.
Four-wheel drive keeps a car going on low-grip surfaces by halving the
amount of power each drive wheel tyre has to transmit. In turn, this halves
the chance of the tyre losing grip and spinning.
As a rough rule of thumb, a car with four driven wheels is four times more
likely to keep moving - or behave itself when driven hard on slippery
surfaces - than one with front or rear drive only.
High-performing cars like the Audi quattro or Mitsubishi 3000GT have
permanent four-wheel drive. Their more elaborate transmissions have a
central differential or viscous coupling to allow the front wheels to
revolve at different speeds from the back ones when the car is going round a
corner. The whole point of giving such cars four-wheel drive is not to let
them be driven fast on dangerously slippery roads but to make them safer at
normal speeds.
Road-going cars with four-wheel drive can cost as little as Pounds 6,697.
This buys a pint-sized but very practical Subaru Vivio five-door. A 4WD
Subaru Justy three-door is a little bigger but not much dearer at Pounds
7,799. Both have four-wheel drive selected at the touch of a button in the
gear lever knob.
At the other extreme, you can pay Pounds 45,894 for an automatic Audi V8
quattro or Pounds 58,960 for a Porsche 911 Carrera 4. In the middle ground
are cars like the BMW 525i X (Pounds 26,700), Subaru Legacy (from Pounds
13,149) and Vauxhall Cavalier 2.0 Turbo 4x4 6sp (Pounds 19,705).
Mention four-wheel drive to most car-buyers, though, and they think
automatically of butch-looking on/off-roaders - even though they intend to
take them off the tarmac rarely, if ever. Dominating the market are the Land
Rover Defender and Discovery and their posh cousin, the Range Rover.
Snapping at their heels for years have been the Mitsubishi Shogun, Nissan
Patrol, Toyota Land Cruiser, Isuzu Trooper, Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen, Daihatsu
Fourtrak and Sportrak, and Suzuki's Samurai and Vitara. Recent arrivals on
the British market have been the Jeep Cherokee station wagons and the rough,
tough Jeep Wrangler.
All are of basically similar layout to the immortal Jeep of the second world
war. Some (for example, all Land Rover products and the G-Wagen) have
permanent all-wheel drive. Shogun and Jeep Cherokee users can pick
four-wheel or two-wheel drive on hard, dry roads. The others - including the
new Nissan Terrano II and Ford Maverick - normally are rear-driven on
tarmac, all-wheel driven off-road.
Why have an on/off-roader to drive only on the road? There is no sensible
answer. Owners say they like the high driving position that lets them look
over hedges. And the rugged construction of their vehicles makes them feel
safe.
In truth, buying an on/off-road 4 x 4 as a car alternative has more to do
with life style (real or assumed) than logic. People who have never ridden a
horse or raised a 12-bore to their shoulder like to wear jodhpurs or waxed
jackets with game pockets. So, if that is what you fancy, why not drive a 4
x 4 that can carry you across ploughed fields as easily as it goes to the
supermarket?
This kind of vehicle used to be either spartan (the old Land Rover) or very
expensive (Range Rover). Now, recreational all-wheel drives feel more like
high-slung Volvo estate cars than distant relatives of wartime Jeeps.
Their weight and bluff shape make them fairly heavy on fuel, though, which
is why most buyers go for the diesel-engined versions - where they exist.
Among the best buys for mainly on-road use are the Vauxhall Frontera (from
Pounds 12,920), Jeep Cherokee (from Pounds 15,995, equipped like a posh
executive saloon), and Isuzu Trooper (from Pounds 16,849). The new,
Spanish-built Nissan Terrano II and Ford Maverick offer car-type, on-road
refinement from about Pounds 14,000, plus more off-road capability than a
typical owner will ever exploit.
Paradoxically, a problem many 4 x 4 owners face is finding rough country
where they may play legally with their vehicles. So, most of the makers now
offer to show buyers how to drive their new 4 x 4 off-road. It is worth
taking up, if only to prove just what a safe, versatile, go-almost-anywhere
package you have bought.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Bring on the Twingo -
Practical runabouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHERE IS the second car that is, above all, practical? A car cheap to buy
and run; compact, yet roomy; and cleanable inside and out, if not with a
hosepipe, then with a bucket and sponge?
There used to be one: the Renault 4. But, having made 8,135,424 of them (two
of which I bought) in 32 years, Renault knocked it on the head last
December. Nothing like it exists now, although the Fiat Panda (also nearing
the end of the road) could have been. It is cheap, square and sensible but
not quite long enough as a load-carrier. And it was never made with four
passenger doors - a must if children are to be stowed away easily and
elderly passengers allowed to enter and leave with dignity.
The Renault 4, like the Citroen 2CV that preceded it, was created for a
France that no longer exists. It was a country populated by peasant farmers
who had been weaned only recently from horses and carts. They wanted a
cheap, simple car that would stand being driven overloaded on bad roads or
across fields.
The 2CV was an unbreakable runabout but the R4 was a better load-carrier -
its tailgate and flat floor were bigger. Like the 2CV, it had nothing
hanging down underneath and very soft, long-travel suspension.
The soft suspension also meant that it rolled on corners like a
flat-bottomed boat in a beam sea but never fell over. I cannot say it was
very fast, but it would hold 65mph on a motorway and even gallop up to an
indicated 80mph, downhill with a following wind.
Its unorthodox gear lever sprouting from the fascia put off many prospective
British buyers, but it worked in the same way as one on the floor. Its great
advantage was leaving the front of the car free of any obstruction. When you
parked, you slid across the seats - lovely soft ones they were, too - and
stepped straight on to the pavement.
The heater was adequate and the fresh-air ventilation primitive but
effective. You opened two large vents in the fascia and bucketfuls of air
rushed in. Wire mesh like a kitchen strainer removed the larger insects and
small birds.
A huge fabric sun-roof was a cheap R4 extra. Open, you could carry long
poles or a ladder - on a fine day, at any rate. Closed, it was leak-proof in
a thunderstorm (or a car wash). And because it was tall, there was enough
room in a Renault 4 for dustbins - even old-fashioned milk churns - to stand
upright. What would not go in could hang out.
Stricter crash-safety requirements finished off the Renault 4. A 32-year-old
design based on a strong, load-bearing platform with a flimsy, lightweight
body could not crumple in the controlled, impact-absorbing way regulations
now demand.
Perhaps buyers are too sophisticated now to appreciate the merits of an
ugly, if practical, car. And since it must be at least 10 years since I
drove a Renault 4, maybe I would find it unacceptably basic as a semi-rural
runabout. But there must be a place for a really simple, roomy car today.
The idea of one lives on at Renault. Star of the 1992 Paris motor show was
its Twingo, a brilliant 'one box' (no bonnet or boot) design with styling
overtones of the Renault Espace but aimed at the broad base of the car
market. Although not as long as the dear old R4 and only a three-door, it is
roomier inside than it looks. That is because its cross-mounted engine takes
up far less space than the 4's fore-and-aft engine plus gearbox stuck out in
front.
Renault is not sure if the Twingo will come to Britain. I reckon it would be
the UK's loss (and Renault's) if it did not.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Spoiled for choice - Load
carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU HAVE a young family, dogs, or both. Perhaps, as a keen gardener, you
need to carry loads of rockery stone. Or you haunt furniture auctions,
hoping for bargains. Whichever the case, you need a roomy estate car.
There was a time when, if a Mercedes-Benz 200-300T, Volvo 240/740/940,
Renault Savanna or Vauxhall Carlton suited neither your pocket nor your
requirements, you were stuck. But, within the past year or two, Ford's
Granada (Scorpio) estate has made a welcome (if belated) reappearance;
Citroen's champion weight-lifter, the XM estate, was introduced; and two
beefy Germans - the Audi 100 and BMW 5-Series Touring, the latter an estate
car in all but name - joined the load-carrying ranks.
More recently, yet more have arrived. Mitsubishi's Australian-built,
front-wheel driven, three-litre Sigma has a huge amount of interior space
and combines US-style smoothness with an almost Germanic feeling of strength
and swiftness. Toyota's Camry luxury estate car was developed and is being
produced in the US from which - like Honda's agreeable Accord estate - it is
exported to Britain. And one of the best all-rounders for space and
refinement (as well as secure handling) is the new Volvo 850 estate with
front-wheel drive.
Sadly, the genuine seven-seat estate car - where everyone faces forward and
which has a realistic amount of space for their luggage - is a disappearing
breed. The splendid Peugeot 505 and Citroen CX Familiale models are no more,
though a Renault Savanna with seven front-facing seats is still around.
Several large estates, among them the much underrated Rover Montego and
various Volvos, can be had with seven seats but the rearmost bench faces
backward. When in use, it is suitable only for children up to the age of 12
and takes up all the luggage space. This, too, is the snag with
multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) such as the Renault Espace and Nissan Serena.
Because recreational 4 x 4s like the Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery and
Mitsubishi Shogun are massively broad-shouldered does not mean they have
huge amounts of cargo space. They do not. The Range Rover is the worst
because its enormous spare wheel is stowed internally; the others do at
least have it bolted on to the back door.
Bought new, large estate cars can be fairly pricy. A Mercedes-Benz 240T
starts at Pounds 23,400, an Audi 100 at Pounds 19,170, and a BMW 5-Series
Touring Pounds 21,800. Ford's Granada estate (from Pounds 17,916), the
Renault Savanna (remarkably, from only Pounds 10,870 for a 1.7-litre), the
Vauxhall Carlton (from Pounds 15,570) and the Volvo 240 (from Pounds 13,395
for a soon-to-disappear Torslanda) are among the best, and least
capital-intensive, buys.
Those looking for second-hand purchases find that large estates hold their
prices better than saloons. Two for which to look out are the Citroen XM and
Volvo 940 2.4SE turbo-diesels (Pounds 20,465 and Pounds 20,745 respectively
when new). For a combination of price, space, weight-shifting ability and
fuel economy, they have no peers.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: VAT 'fraud' by stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING SPENT much time working abroad, I now have frequent opportunities to
host numerous overseas visitors, whom I naturally encourage to spend freely
in our shops.
To my extreme embarrassment, however, I find that some of our major stores
have a policy which appears to defraud overseas residents of some of the VAT
amount that the tax legislation entitles them to.
This is done by making an administrative charge, or by refusing to make any
refund other than through a third party who, in turn, deducts an
administrative fee from the VAT amount. Can visitors insist on a refund of
the full VAT amount?
Suppliers of goods are not obliged to operate the VAT refund scheme but, if
they do, they have to comply with the conditions of the scheme. No doubt,
some take the view that, because of the extra work involved, they should
make a charge for operating the scheme. Some retailers use refund companies
to make the refund arrangements.
If an administrative fee is to be charged, the retailer should explain this
clearly to the customer. There is no question of the full amount of VAT not
being refunded in appropriate cases. This does not mean that a retailer
cannot make a charge for operating the refund scheme. The rules are set out
in HM Customs and Excise Notice 704, which you can obtain from your local
VAT office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR CAPITAL gains tax purposes, my shareholding in RTZ is split into two
pools, before and after April 5 1982. In April this year, I opted for the
enhanced scrip dividend of the company and accepted the corresponding BZW
cash offer, and intend to do the same with the current enhanced scrip
dividend and BZW cash offer.
To compute capital gains/losses:
1. Does the 10-day rule apply, whereby the new shares acquired are
identified with the same shares disposed of, given that the acquisitions and
disposals take place within 10 days? Or,
2. Does one add the cost of the new shares to the cost base of the
post-April 1982 pool? Or,
3. Does one apportion the new shares between the ante- and post-April 1982
pools, adding their costs to the base costs of these pools?
1. No.
2. No.
3. Yes, by virtue of section 141 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992, in conjunction with section 128(1).
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (The indexation allowance
for quoted shares).

FT  24 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Complicated tax rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS ABROAD when the 1993/94 Budget was submitted to parliament. In due
course, I saw that the tax dividend credit on shares had been reduced to 20
per cent from the previous 25. I am still not clear as to the effect this
will have on my income tax.
In April 1993, I had no further tax liability (as a standard 25 per cent
taxpayer) on dividends received. Does the new provision mean that I will
have to pay the additional 5 per cent when my annual tax assessment is
raised?
If your income does not exceed the basic-rate limit, you will be liable only
to tax at 20 per cent on your dividends (not 25 per cent). On the other
hand, higher rate-payers have to pay 40 per cent on their dividends.
The effect of these new tax rules for dividends is very complicated for
capital gains tax-payers (and, indeed, the rules had to be re-written at the
committee stage of the Finance (No 2) Bill). They are difficult to explain
in words, but we shall be happy to give you a specimen calculation if you
care to suggest some likely figures of (a) UK dividends, (b) foreign
dividends, (c) other income, and (d) net chargeable gains.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Software that shifts the
furniture - Daniel Green enjoys the multimedia revolution / Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I REBUILT my flat at the weekend. Everything from doors and walls to kitchen
fittings and furniture. It took about an hour and looked very pretty.
Then I walked around it, stepping easily through solid partitions like
Hamlet's father at Elsinore. I moved doors and chairs willy nilly and began
to dream of a career as an interior designer. But I lost patience with my
creation, put up a few pictures and demolished a load-bearing beam. Then I
walked through some more walls just for fun.
Was I on some press junket to the West Coast to play with the latest in
virtual reality gadgetry? No. I was using an architectural package called
Virtus Walkthrough on an ordinary Apple Macintosh desk-top computer.
Virtus Walkthrough is one of those delightful computer products anyone can
use within a few minutes. It is aimed at professional architects and
interior designers and is intended to give them and their clients an idea of
what it would be like to live and work inside their designs.
It works simply. As you prepare a two-dimensional floor plan or elevation on
the left side of the screen, the computer automatically creates a
three-dimensional version on the right side. In the middle of the right side
is a cross. Put your cursor above the cross, click and you slide forward in
the three-dimensional world. Put the cursor to the left or right of the
cross and the view swivels around you.
When you have finished your work you can record a whole sequence of zooms,
through doors and walls, up ladders and down stairs to give a client an
occupant's eye view.
Virtus Walkthrough is neat, but its significance is broader. It is part of a
new generation of programs that take desktop computers beyond the realms of
accounts packages and spreadsheets into a world where video-game technology
becomes a business tool. This new type of software has a new name:
multimedia.
Like much jargon, the definition of multimedia is vague. In principle it
means using pictures, and maybe sound, as well as words and numbers.
There are two families of multimedia program:
authoring packages, in which architects, marketing executives, advertisement
directors and a host of others can prepare sales presentations and
brochures, edit videotape, create animations and prepare colour
advertisements. reference, in which huge numbers of words, pictures and
sounds are stored on a compact disc whence they can be retrieved in seconds.
Examples are encyclopaedias, do-it-yourself manuals and music appreciation
lessons in which you can play digitally-recorded sounds from any of hundreds
of solo instruments, orchestras and pop groups while reading about them and
looking at colour illustrations.
At their best, multimedia programs are both powerful and a pleasure to use.
The catch is you may have to change your computer to make the best use of
them.
The authoring packages are most comfortable in the world of Apple's
Macintosh. Apple has for a decade concentrated on pictures and sound while
IBM and its clones got on with number crunching.
As a result, Mac owners are often deprived of the latest version of a word
processor or spreadsheet for months after the PC version is launched.
On the other hand, Virtus Walkthrough has been available for the Mac for
three years but was launched for Windows only this spring. Mac users also
get first bite at Photoshop, a powerful picture retouching package that
allows you to eliminate wrinkles and whiten teeth without going near Harley
Street. They are often first in line for video editors, desktop publishers
and 'rendering' packages that can create pictures of photographic realism.
But while Apples may have the edge for those wanting to be original, Windows
PCs may give you more choice of compact disc software. The reason is simple:
although you can buy both Apple and Windows computers with built-in CD
players, there are many more Windows computers than Macintoshes. The cost of
a CD falls quickly as production rises, so software companies have
concentrated on the Windows.
It is early days for both kinds of multimedia program. Only now are
Macintoshes powerful enough to manipulate pictures quickly. CD computers are
still unusual and less than 100 CD-based packages are on the market.
But the pace is quickening. The next generation of even faster Macs is
planned. Software houses are joining with book publishers to find products
for CD-based computers.
Virtus Walkthrough, rrp Pounds 410, Stratavision 3D rrp Pounds 680 Gomark,
071 - 731 7930. In the US, 919 - 467 9700.
Adobe Photoshop. rrp Pounds 725 Adobe 081 - 547 1900. In the US. 415 - 961
4400.
Shop around for discounts.
Macintoshes powerful enough to run graphics well cost at least Pounds 1,000.
If you want a CD too, the Apple Perfoma 600CD costs about Pounds 2,150.
Typical Windows CD computers are Compaq's Prolinea 4/25 S at about Pounds
1,800 and Apricot's Xen PC at about Pounds 1,200.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Spitfires on the runway - Clive
Fewins visits a small company that rebuilds old aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1944 Spitfire Mk16E stands forlorn, its fuselage on large trestles,
wings standing separately beside it in the bright, clean hangar. It is for
sale for Pounds 275,000. A further Pounds 425,000 could make it fly.
The hangar is the home of Historic Flying. The Spitfire is the last of five
that the 11-man company acquired from the RAF in 1988. It was a deal in
which no money changed hands. HFL gave a restored Bristol Beaufort and an
American P40 WSM ('Kitty Hawk') fighter to the RAF Museum at Hendon and paid
for nine glass fibre replica Spitfires and three replica Hurricanes to act
as 'gate guardians' at RAF stations. In exchange, it received the Spitfires,
which had acted as gate guardians.
The five Spitfires will eventually join the 40 or so that are airworthy. In
the five years since it was formed, HFL has worked on seven of them. Two
owners regularly fly their machines into the company's grass landing strip
near Saffron Walden, Essex, for checks.
One of the Spitfires is domiciled in the HFL hangar, while in yet another
corner of the 10,000 sq ft building are the airframe, wings and several more
sections of Spitfire BM597, destined to be the personal aircraft of managing
director Tim Routsis.
Since he was 18, Routsis, 33, has wanted his own Spitfire. He formed HFL in
1988 with four others with the express aim of eventually rebuilding his own
aircraft.
Routsis believes it will be at least two years before he achieves his
ambition. In the meantime, he and fellow director, Clive Denny, have to
content themselves with flying the company's 1952 Chipmunk trainer, and
occasionally flying clients' Spitfires to air shows and to Saffron Walden
for maintenance checks.
'Flying a Spitfire is every bit as good as it has been made out to be by
writers over the years,' says Routsis. 'It is the sound of freedom. Even if,
like me, you are far too young for it to bring back memories, it is a sound
that cannot fail to grab you.'
Routsis and his colleagues discovered they had a mutual love of Spitfires
when they met in the mid-1980s through the Cambridge flying club. Denny and
his friend Ian Warren (now a director of HFL) were working at nearby
Stansted in their own particular fields of aircraft finishing and metal
fitting.
For the first two years they ran the business from an old milking parlour
near Braintree, bringing in aircraft by road and using a private airstrip a
mile away.
Gradually they recruited airframe, engine and electrical experts, fitters
and painting specialists to the team, which tackles almost all kinds of work
on aircraft of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.
Three years ago, after the sale of its first Spitfire, HFL moved to the new
site, which it rents, and built the Pounds 300,000 hangar with the proceeds
of the sale. Since then the company has been self-financing, with the aid of
a small loan.
The team usually hears of jobs through the tightly-knit world of historic
flying enthusiasts. A typical job was the Pounds 35,000 engine change and
inspection of a 1944 US-designed Australian-built Mustang fighter. It came
via an intermediary acting for the owner, a wealthy French businessman, whom
Routsis and his colleagues never met.
Jobs can take years. A second world war Luftwaffe Bucker-Yungman trainer - a
small biplane, akin to the British Tiger Moth - is being rebuilt for a
private customer who is paying for the work in stages, as he can afford it.
Other jobs are more exotic, such as the recent rebuild of a Russian YAK 1
fighter, shot down in 1941. It crash-landed on a frozen lake; when the ice
melted it sank.
'It was recovered in 1991, acquired by a private collection, and brought
here,' says Denny. 'We managed to find a Russian Klimov engine of the
original type, which we fitted, so it was able to fly out in style.'
HFL does not rebuild engines. 'Rolls-Royce won't touch Merlin engines, so we
have to go to a specialist company in California for them,' says Denny. 'The
ironic thing is that we have had two Spitfires back from the US partly
restored for us to finish the job here. The reason the owners stopped the
American restoration in mid-flight was the problem of access to authentic
spares. US rivets, nuts and bolts often lack authenticity. If you are
spending Pounds 700,000 on a rebuild you might as well get it absolutely
correct.'
For the HFL team, work on Spitfires is a high note. They scour the world for
spares. In the case of Spitfires it is not always difficult to find spares.
'If you know where to look, it's like the Austin 7 club. You can pick up all
sorts of original spares from companies specialising in surplus military
equipment,' says Denny.
For much of the time the team has to be content with what they call 'bread
and butter' work: inspection and maintenance of all manner of small
aircraft, often quite modern ones. HFL also has a contract with the RAF to
rebuild and supply wings for Chipmunk trainers.
Says Denny: 'We are going through a quiet period, so work like this is
welcome. In the present climate not many people can find the money to buy a
Spitfire, let alone the Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 2,000 an hour needed to run
it.'
Last year HFL turned over Pounds 750,000. 'It's a roller-coaster business
and in a good year business is very good,' says Routsis. 'We are all
enthusiasts, and we are managing to keep the team together, which is all we
can hope for in the present circumstances.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: How sport can damage the national
health - Injuries to amateurs and loss of production total nearly Pounds 1bn
each year. But you can insure against disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPORT is supposed to make you healthier but the number of people limping
back from skiing holidays, or appearing with an arm in a sling after a
squash match, can give the opposite impression.
A study by Sheffield University's medical school estimated that 8m days were
taken off work every year in England and Wales because of amateur sporting
injuries. Recurrent injuries accounted for another 3m days off. The study
put the cost of lost production and treatment for all of these injuries at
almost Pounds 1bn a year.
Researchers found that while more than a quarter of injuries came from
soccer, the most risky amateur sport was rugby, with 54 significant injuries
for every 1,000 occasions of play compared with three per 1,000 in swimming.
Another risk faced by amateur sportsmen is being sued for damages - say, if
a golfer injures someone with a bad slice off the tee or a cricketer damages
property with a towering six of the Botham variety. But insurance is
available for all these eventualities; in fact, you might be covered already
without realising it.
Many sports groups, teams and clubs have insurance covering all their
members for accidents, whether to themselves or others. But such cover tends
to provide fairly low pay-outs, so you might find it prudent to take out
another policy, either as a top-up with the same insurer or separately.
If you have a personal accident or permanent health insurance policy
already, you might find it covers injuries from the milder sports. But these
policies often exclude horse, car or motor cycle racing, mountaineering,
potholing, flying (as a pilot) and winter sports. Some may exclude 'violent'
sports like rugby or karate or insist on special terms for them, such as
higher premiums or a lower level of cover.
Winter sports can be covered most easily with a travel insurance policy  -
unless you indulge often, in which case an individual sports insurance
policy could be worthwhile.
A number of specialist insurers offer personal accident policies for one
specific sport, often through an arrangement with its national controlling
body. Some also cover sports equipment for theft and damage under the same
policy. Ask your organisation about any scheme it might have.
If you are an all-rounder who prefers to take part in a number of different
activities, it could be worth your while to examine a policy of the type
offered by Crispin Speers and Amsport, a subsidiary of Norex. This divides
sport into three risk levels.
You take out insurance at the level appropriate for your most dangerous
activity; this then covers you for any other activity in the same or a lower
category.
Crispin Speers' (071-480-5083) amateur sports policy can be taken out for
individuals or teams of up to 20 people. It divides a list of several dozen
sports into three risk categories.
The lowest includes badminton, golf, rowing and squash. Football, polo,
martial arts and equestrian sports are rated medium risk; while rugby,
American football, mountaineering and motor racing are high risk.
The premiums are calculated in units of Pounds 100, and the amount of cover
for each depends on the risk category. For an individual in a low-risk
sport, Pounds 100 would buy accidental death and dismemberment cover of
Pounds 25,000, permanent total disablement cover of Pounds 50,000, and
temporary total disablement of Pounds 100 a week.
For a high-risk sport, the same premium would buy Pounds 10,000 of
accidental death and dismemberment cover, Pounds 20,000 of permanent total
disablement, and Pounds 50 a week for temporary total disablement. A maximum
of 10 units can be taken out, but Crispin Speers does not offer liability
cover.
Amsport's (071-895-9950) Gameplan policy for individuals lists 102 sports in
three risk categories. The list is similar to that of Crispin Speers but the
companies take a different view of some activities. Amsport defines
water-skiing as high risk but Crispin Speers rates it as low.
Cover comes in gold, silver or bronze versions. Gold cover provides a weekly
benefit of Pounds 100; hospital benefit of Pounds 30 a night; dental fees of
Pounds 275; physiotherapy fees of Pounds 300, Pounds 37,500 if you should
lose a hand, foot, arm, eye or leg, or as a death benefit; and Pounds 75,000
if you should lose both of any of them, or for permanent total disablement.
There is also Pounds 1m personal liability insurance and all the cover
applies to any sport you attend as a spectator. Gold cover costs Pounds 124
a year for high risk, Pounds 84 for intermediate and Pounds 58 for low risk.
A discount of 20 per cent is available if you opt out of the weekly benefit.
Amsport also has separate policies for school-age footballers, as well as
adult football and rugby teams.
Wellesley (0279-626262) offers a policy for amateur sports teams of up to 20
people. The premiums are calculated by units and each covers each member of
the team for benefits of Pounds 5,000 each for death, loss of an eye or
limb, or permanent total disablement; Pounds 25 a week for temporary total
disablement; Pounds 10 a night in hospital; and up to Pounds 250 for dental
fees.
A cricket team would pay Pounds 125 a unit, a football team Pounds 165 and a
rugby team Pounds 450. Public liability cover of Pounds 1m is an optional
extra at Pounds 75 for a rugby team or Pounds 50 for other team.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Prolific comes in from the heat -
Unit trusts / A fund which survived turbulence to reach calm waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW COMPANIES can claim historical links with John Maynard Keynes but
Prolific is one. Keynes, who died in 1946, worked as a fund manager for
Provincial, the privately-run insurance company established in the 1900s.
Provincial was the parent company of Prolific, the unit trust subsidiary
which it set up in 1969.
Prolific was as good as its name, and had become the UK's 15th-largest unit
trust group by the late 1980s. But its growth brought it into collision with
its parent and, after a period of rebellion, it finally demerged from
Provincial in an acrimonious split.
After trying to stand on its own feet, the need for capital to finance an
expansion of the business led to its purchase by Hafnia, the Danish
financial services conglomerate which was broken up last year after becoming
insolvent.
Michael Vogel, fund manager of the High Income fund - one of the best
performers in the Prolific stable - acknowledges that the company has been
through torrid times. But it now appears to be back on a more even keel
after its purchase last year by Scottish Provident, the mutual life insurer,
which has left the unit trust and investment management part of Prolific as
a stand-alone business.
This period of turmoil has not helped to achieve stable performance but the
fund, which had a weak year in 1990, seems to have overcome these problems
in the past 12 months.
The High Income fund was launched in 1974 and, with more than Pounds 350m
under management, it is one of the largest in the UK equity income sector.
It is sixth in terms of performance in the 10 years to July 1, according to
Finstat, and has appeared consistently as one of the 20 top-performing funds
since then (with the exception of the year to July 1, when it was ranked 28
out of 112 funds.)
The fund has only had two managers. Andrew Cherniavsky took it through its
first 14 years and Vogel, who had been with M &amp; G unit trusts, took over
five years ago. Its emphasis is on total return by trying to achieve capital
growth while providing real growth in income. Vogel is proud of the fund's
record of never having cut its distribution, and says the average annual
dividend growth has been 15 per cent since its launch.
This commitment to an increasing dividend helps to account for the lack of
resemblance of the fund's portfolio to traditional high-yielding funds.
Instead of having a large holding of utilities or other high-yielding
stocks, the fund is concentrated in 20 companies. These have been selected
for their capacity to sustain dividend growth over a long period of time,
rather than a high yield.
Kalon, the paint company, is a good example. It has a yield of 2.7 per cent
but its dividend growth has been 40 per cent for the past two years. 'We
don't buy into high-yielding stocks which then cut the dividend,' says
Vogel.
The largest holdings are in Siebe, the instruments and controls manufacturer
which has a yield of only 2.7 per cent; BTP, the chemical company; Shell,
the oil giant: and BAT Industries, the tobacco conglomerate.
The 20 holdings account for just under 60 per cent of High Income while 15
per cent is invested in high-yielding convertibles and preference shares.
By tradition the fund has had a heavy weighting in small to medium size
companies in order to push up growth. Around 40 per cent is invested in
companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 100-500m and a further 8
per cent is held in smaller companies, with the balance in FT-SE 100
companies.
The drawback is that the smaller companies tend to fare badly in times of
recession as investors flock to the relative safety of the blue chip
companies. High Income was hit heavily after the 1987 crash and performance
dipped again in 1990/91 as the recession took its toll on its core holdings.
'We did sit down more than once after the crash and asked ourselves whether
our theory was flawed, but we concluded that quality will come through,'
says Vogel. He is now glad to have kept his nerve by retaining his core
holdings, such as T. Cowie, the vehicle finance company which bounced back
from a low of 28p to 245p; Kalon, which fell to 33p and is now 155p; and
London Forfaiting, the specialist trade finance house: its price price
dropped to 40p and is now 215p.
To balance the concentration on medium-size stocks, the fund has a
relatively high overseas exposure through its investment in UK-quoted
companies with a high proportion of overseas earnings, such as Siebe.
'This is a defensive position because we think that, over time, sterling
will decline and the UK economy will be weaker than the average Western
economy,' says Vogel. 'It does mean, though, that in times when the pound is
strong, the fund underperforms.'
Overall, 60-65 per cent of the earnings of the companies in the fund are
from overseas, some 10 per cent above the average for the market.
How can Vogel tell which companies will maintain dividend growth? He uses
some brokers but, in the main, 'we find our dividend growth companies from
the management of the companies we have cultivated over a number of years.'
Despite High Income's commitment to dividend growth, what of those investors
who need a high income to live off? The yield on High Income is 3.9 per
cent, which is lower than the average income unit trust and lower, too, than
the yield on the FT-SE 100 of just over 4 per cent. (The graph does not
include re-invested income and, therefore, under-represents the fund
performance).
Vogel says that for the sacrifice of a low yield in the first few years, the
dividend growth will more than make up the shortfall. He argues that this is
a fund for the long-term investor wanting a steady stream of increasing
income combined with capital growth.
Charges
The initial charge on the units is 5.25 per cent and the bid-offer spread on
July 21 was 6 per cent. The annual mangement fee is 1 per cent and the
minimum investment is Pounds 250. The minimum monthly investment into the
savings scheme is Pounds 50. High Income qualifies for full Pep status;
there are no extra charges for the Pep.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Oxford is next for BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOLLOWING its stock market-linked business expansion scheme launched just
two weeks ago, Close Brothers is sponsoring a similar plan. Money raised
through BESSA Oxford will go towards providing student accommodation for
Oxford colleges.
As with BESSA Christ's College Companies, which has sold out, investors are
given a choice of two companies in which to invest. The first offers a fixed
return after five years of 120p for every 100p invested, which equates to a
return of 13.7 per cent a year to a higher-rate taxpayer and 9.4 per cent to
a lower rate-payer. The return is backed by five-year zero coupon bonds.
The second will give a fixed return of 60p for each 100p invested after five
years - the original net investment for a higher-rate taxpayer - with a
variable return which depends on a rise in the FT-SE 100 index over four
years and 11 months. Close Brothers says it can treble the rise in the
Footsie on the net investment through the use of options.
How? The terms of the option mean that, for each 1 per cent rise in the
index, the variable return will increase by 181p a share. Since the cost to
a higher rate-payer investing 100p a share is only a net 60p, the 1 per cent
rise will give shareholders 181p for their 100p gross investment - three
times the net investment.
If the Footsie falls, or does not rise, the index options will have no value
and investors will simply get back their original investment. They can
divide their money between the two companies; the minimum investment is
Pounds 2,000.
Capital Ventures has increased the contracted exit price on its Cambridge
Collegiate Consortium BES from 117p after five years for every 100p
invested, to 120p.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Bankruptcy poses threat to pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL bankruptcies increased by 44 per cent last year compared with
1991, according to figures published by the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI). This means that, last year, almost 37,000 people met financial ruin.
They may feel that their retirement provision at least is protected securely
through their pension. But some pension specialists believe the law
surrounding pension rights in bankruptcy is unclear and that, in certain
cases, the Official Receiver (the liquidator) or Trustee in Bankruptcy can
gain access to your pension fund.
If you are declared bankrupt, an Official Receiver or Trustee in Bankruptcy
is appointed to investigate your financial affairs.
The DTI says: 'Bankruptcy will almost certainly involve the closure of any
business you run and the dismissal of your employees. You will have to give
up any possessions of value and your interest in your house.'
The Official Receiver will take control of your assets, and either he or the
Trustee will dispose of them to pay your creditors. Perhaps most
devastating, your family home could be sold to help pay your debts.
Next to the family home, a pension is usually a person's most valuable
possession. Under the Insolvency Act, pensions are classed as assets and
can, in theory, be used to help pay the bankrupt's debts.
The treatment of the pension will depend, however, on whether the person
actually has retired (and, therefore, has a tangible asset in his hands) or
is still working and has only 'future rights' to the benefits. By law,
employees with personal pensions cannot gain access to their fund until at
least age 50. In most occupational schemes, they must wait until company
pension age - usually, between 60 and 65.
Once the pension is due, it becomes an asset. But those nearing retirement
and facing potential bankruptcy should take advice before requesting that
part of their benefits are paid as a tax-free cash lump sum (known as
commutation).
Lesley Browning, a solicitor with Nabarro Nathanson, says: 'Although the
Trustee in Bankruptcy does not automatically take possession of the lump
sum, he can serve notice on the bankrupt so that the lump sum becomes his
property. The bankrupt must notify the Trustee in Bankruptcy within 21 days
of receipt of the lump sum. Clearly, in these circumstances it makes sense
not to elect to take a lump sum but to take the entire benefit as pension
instead.'
Of course, the Trustee also can gain access to the bankrupt's income from
the occupational scheme. Browning says: 'The Trustee can apply to the courts
for an income payments order under the Insolvency Act under which part of
the pension payments are redirected to him. However, the court will always
assess the pensioner's needs and will not reduce the pension to an amount
upon which it would be difficult to live.'
With personal pensions, employees could face problems if they are over 50
but still working. David Holland, managing director of financial adviser RK
Harrison, warns: 'The Trustee in Bankruptcy 'stands in the shoes' of the
bankrupt and in the case of a personal pension, where the bankrupt has the
option of taking benefits at age-50, the Trustee can take the benefits in
the same way.' Holland added, however, that there was little evidence that
liquidators were doing this.
The situation regarding individuals who are still working when they become
bankrupt is more complex. Robin Ellison, a partner with pensions solicitor
Ellison Westhorp, says that though your pension is classed as an asset, it
does not really become so until it is realised.
The same is true of preserved (or 'frozen') pensions. These are the benefits
you leave behind in a company scheme when you change jobs.
Rather worryingly, the Social Security Act 1973 states that 'scheme rules
can permit forfeiture of short service benefits (ie, preserved pensions)
when an individual becomes bankrupt.' But Ellison says the vast majority of
occupational schemes include a Catch-22 clause in their trust deed. This has
the effect of changing the individual's right to a benefit into a
discretion. Once the benefits can be paid only by the discretion of the
scheme's trustees, the pension is no longer an asset and cannot be seized by
the liquidators.
One exception to this rule is where a company or individual on the brink of
insolvency pays large contributions into a pension scheme in an attempt to
shelter assets from creditors. Lloyd's Names, for example, might be tempted
particularly by this device, given their present plight.
In these circumstances, the Trustee could have a strong case for gaining
access to the funds, although experts believe the law is unclear.
Paul Newman, a barrister at Wilberforce Chambers, says: 'It seems on balance
that it would actually be very difficult for the Trustee to stop a potential
bankrupt from putting money into a pension scheme to shelter it from
creditors.'
Newman explains that part of the problem lies in the fact that the money is
not being passed on to a third party but is being set aside for the
bankrupt.
Bankruptcy generally lasts for three years and then the debt is discharged
so there is also the practical problem for the Trustee in Bankruptcy to gain
access to the future rights of a scheme if they are not available to the
bankrupt until the three years is up.'
It would seem that the law almost goes out of its way to protect the pension
rights of bankrupts, although test cases may force legislative changes in
the case of individuals who use their scheme or plan deliberately as a way
to shelter funds from creditors.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: There'll be L to pay in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first L-registered cars appear next month and motorists' thoughts will
be turning to how best to pay for a new one. Shrewder drivers may also be
thinking about buying a used car.
Car finance can be a complicated area, as different options are difficult to
compare. The main choices are between manufacturer's finance, or a loan or
hire purchase plan with a financial institution.
The traditional way to buy a car is on hire purchase, and this is still
offered by car companies' finance arms and some independent finance
companies. Interest rates are lower than on personal loans, but you will not
own the car until you have made the final payment. Defaulting will lose you
both the car and everything you have paid. Manufacturers' own loans can be
good value, with lower annual percentage rates than from other lenders, but
the attractiveness of the rate will depend on how much deposit you put down,
and there may be a relatively short time to pay off the loan. A personal
loan from another lender could be more flexible.
A new option, strongly promoted by most car makers, is an American-style
personal contract purchase scheme. Ford's scheme is called Options,
Vauxhall's is Choices 1-2-3, Rover and BMW both call theirs Select, and so
on.
Essentially, all work in the same way, based on the concept of a minimum
guaranteed future value (MGFV). This is what the dealer and customer agree
the car should be worth at the end of a two- or three-year contract,
allowing for limited annual mileage and reasonable maintenance. Then, a hire
purchase-type contract is set up for two or three years. The customer pays
only for the car's price less a deposit and the MGFV - although interest is
charged on the price including the MGFV - making monthly payments cheaper
than normal hire purchase.
At the end of the contract period, the customer can either hand the car back
and walk away, buy it outright for the MGFV (using savings or a loan), or
trade it in for a new model.
This type of contract is very common in the US, and is starting to prove
popular in the UK. One drawback is that contracts are based on the car's
list price, rather than a price you negotiate with a dealer.
Price negotiation may still be possible with other kinds of manufacturer's
finance, but you will probably have the most leverage if you are effectively
a cash buyer.
August is not a good month for trying to get a large discount on a new car,
except perhaps towards the end of the month when dealers are under pressure
to meet sales targets. However, the large numbers of people trying to sell
their old cars and buy newly-registered vehicles can mean there are good
used motor deals. TSB has published a free booklet giving tips on how to
bargain for goods and services. The chapter on cars includes a calendar of
best times to buy.
If you decide to use a personal loan to finance your purchase, a wide range
of companies will be eager to lend you money. If you are a homeowner whose
mortgage is less than the current value of your home, you could take out a
secured loan. These are generally cheaper than unsecured loans, but remember
you are putting your house at risk if you do not keep up repayments. It is
unlikely to be worth staking your home for a lower rate of interest on a
relatively small loan.
Unsecured personal loans are riskier for the lender, so interest rates tend
to be higher, but if you shop around, you can find good deals.
There is usually a maximum amount of around Pounds 10,000 that banks and
building societies are willing to lend as an unsecured loan for a car. Some
offer loans only to existing customers, although others will let you take
out a loan and open an account at the same time. Marks and Spencer offers a
good deal for account customers, but its maximum loan is Pounds 5,000, and
interest rates are slightly higher for non-account holders.
Many high street lenders have special offers on personal loans for car
buyers during August, such as cuts in interest rates, free gifts or discount
vouchers. Barclays, Midland and the TSB are all cutting normal loan rates by
2 percentage points for car purchases before the end of August, while
Halifax has cut its rate by 1 percentage point.
Abbey National is giving away a free car alarm or steering wheel lock with
every car loan taken out before the end of August. HFC bank has a package of
offers and discounts with its car loans, including free RAC membership, and
discounts on Scorpion car alarms, RAC motor insurance and inspections of
second-hand cars.
However, free gifts can obscure the fact that HFC's loans are more expensive
than competitors' (see table), with APRs of 23.6 per cent on loans of Pounds
2,000-Pounds 4,999, and 21.9 per cent on loans over Pounds 5,000. As with
all special offers, it is worth checking exactly what the offer is worth.
Most lenders will offer payment protection insurance for the loan, which
will cover repayments if you cannot work because of illness or unemployment,
or if you die. But this can add significantly to loan costs. Ask for details
before you sign. Beware of inertia selling. For example, Barclays requires
you to tick a box if you do not want insurance. The application form for a
loan from the Alliance and Leicester does not even have a box to tick - some
extremely small print instructs you to delete a clause and initial it if you
do not want the insurance, which adds more than Pounds 500 to the cost of a
Pounds 5,000 loan over two years.
A two-page special report on second cars appears on Pages VIII and IX.

FT  24 JUL 93 / CGT for June
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in June.
Multiply the original cost of the asset for the figure shown for the month
in which you bought it.  Subtract the results from the proceeds of your sale
and the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 5,000 in June 1985 and sold them
in June 1993 for Pounds 13,000.  Multiplying the original cost by the June
1985 figure of 1,478 gives a total of Pounds 7,390.
Subtracting that from the Pound 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 5,610,
which is below the 1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800.  If you sell
shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure.
The RPI in June was 141.0

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Computer data quiz for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET banks are to be asked what information they keep on customers
after it was disclosed this week that National Westminster holds computer
information about the political affiliation and religious beliefs of some of
its 6.5m personal customers.
Francis Aldhouse, the deputy data protection registrar, said that holding
information about political affiliations was 'potentially sensitive' and
indicated that customers were entitled to an explanation.
'We will be taking this issue up with all leading banks because we are not
quite sure what the situation is,' he added.
The other three big English banks - Midland, Barclays and Lloyds - have said
they do not hold information about a customer's political views on file.
NatWest said it does not solicit the information but might record it if it
were to crop up in conversation. The bank claimed the main purpose of
holding the information was to build a relationship with customers.
'If a bank manager is entertaining a customer who is a vegetarian, he won't
want to put his foot in it by serving him meat,' said NatWest.
'The same applies to some leisure activities or knowing whether the customer
is a member of the local conservative club. This is what relationship
banking is about.'
There is nothing illegal about NatWest's actions since it is registered to
hold this information. Under the Data Protection Act 1984, information
stored on a computer for any reason other than accounting purposes must be
recorded with the Data Protection Registrar.
'The registry is in essence a declaration by an organisation of the sort of
information it holds on computer,' said John Lamidey, assistant data
protection registrar. There are more than 160,000 organisations on it and it
is open to public inspection.
Banks often record information which might be helpful to them for marketing
some of their products, which could be insurance-related or investment
oriented, such as a unit trust or services offered by the credit card it
issues.
The worry for consumers is that what is held on computer is available to
credit reference agencies. NatWest says it would make available information
relevant only to the granting of credit, such as a customer's income.
Under the Consumer Credit Act, individuals have a right to see information
held on them by a credit reference agency on payment of Pounds 1.
Public concern about personal data stored on computer extends beyond the
access which credit reference agencies and tracing agents - licensed
organisations which specialise in debt collection - have to it.
Earlier this month Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, said he was
worried about about the growing black market in confidential personal
information.
The market has arisen either because bank staff supply details knowingly to
third parties or because they are tricked into giving away confidential
information.
Customers who are worried about the information that might be held by their
bank have a right under the Data Protection Act to see what is in their
files. Banks are not allowed to charge more than Pounds 10 for this access.

THE SHARE price performance of electronics group Vistec over the past 2 1/2
years has been strong. Robert Morton, the group's high-profile chairman,
capitalised when he bought 1.8m at between 10-13p in 1991. Now, chief
executive Adrian Wallis has sold 350,000 at 29p, having disposed of 650,000
for 26p at the start of the year.
Having slumbered peacefully for most of the past five years, Norbain
Electronics' share price burst into life at the turn of the year, rising
from a low of 58p to the present level, a record high. John Nicol, chairman
and managing director, has sold 350,000 shares at 155p. But perhaps this
disposal should be viewed in the context of two previous sales - one of 1m
shares at 37p, the other of 350,000 for the same price - in September 1991
and 1992 respectively.
There was selling this week in another electronics company, Logica. Logica
has had its fair share of problems in recent times but seems to have got
over the worst. In September 1990, Leonard Taylor, a non-executive director,
bought 100,000 shares at 155p and sold them for 236p a few months later.
This time, he and a colleague have each sold sold 75,000 at 245p, leaving
Taylor with about 1.4m.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Court boost for income plan victims
 -Judges clear way for pay-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of people who were not warned of the risks of home income plans
stand to receive thousands of pounds in compensation, thanks to a high court
ruling this week which extended the grounds for compensation.
Home income plans were sold late in the 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as
a safe way to release income from their homes. In fact, the schemes were
highly risky and involved taking out a mortgage and investing in
equity-linked bonds.
The investment was meant to produce returns high enough to meet the mortgage
payments and to produce an income on top. But the value of the bonds fell as
interest rates rose and house prices dropped, pushing many people into debt.
Earlier this month, William Powell, Conservative MP for Corby, said the
schemes had resulted in 'misery across the country' and accused West
Bromwich building society - which lent about Pounds 24m through them - of
acting improperly in the way it marketed them.
People who were sold a plan by a member of Fimbra (the self-regulatory
organisation for independent financial advisers), which then went into
default, have recourse under the investors compensation scheme - but this
limits the maximum payout per claim to Pounds 48,000. The ICS came into
existence only on August 28 1988 and has always maintained that compensation
is not available to those who were sold plans before then.
The cases were brought against the ICS in the High Court by solicitor
Barnett Sampson, which represents 450 people who bought home income plans.
One of them is Margaret Weyell, a widow who owned a house in Kent worth
Pounds 160,000 in 1988 and free of a mortgage. She wanted to raise Pounds
10,000 to help her son buy a house and took out a home income plan after
advice in July 1988 from Aylesbury Associates, a Fimbra member.
She was not told that the plan carried any risk, and the mortgage was
executed in September. After her plan collapsed, she was forced to sell her
home in 1991 and move to a cheaper property. Aylesbury went into default
last year but the ICS refused her compensation because the deal took place
before August 28 1988.
Finding for Weyell, Lord Justice Glidewell and Mr Justice Cresswell said in
part: 'Under their agreements with the investors, Aylesbury undertook to
report on the portfolio every six months. This obligation itself imposed
upon them a duty in contract to give reasonable competent advice about the
future mangement of the clients' portfolio.'
In another case, John Veniard and his wife agreed to invest in a plan in
1987 after meeting an Aylesbury adviser socially. The couple took out a
Pounds 60,000 mortgage and Aylesbury started to manage their investment fund
in October 1987.
By November 1990, the investment fund was empty and, instead of reducing the
size of the mortgage, the loan had climbed to more than Pounds 66,000. The
couple had to sell their home and move into rented accommodation.
The court decided that although the couple could not claim full compensation
for the bad advice given, since the whole investment transaction had taken
place before 1988, they were entitled to compensation for losses occurring
as a result of poor advice after that date.
The court also ruled that the ICS was wrong to halve the amount of
compensation to a surviving spouse. Earlier this year, relatives of victims
had managed to win in the High Court the right to bring or pursue
compensation on behalf of a claimant who had died.
The ICS then said it would halve an award if a husband or wife died by
applying one of its rules which treats the claim brought by two or more
people as one claim. But the judges said this week that the rules did not
provide any support for such 'an unjust conclusion.'
They added: 'It would be an extraordinary result if the surviving spouse's
claim for compensation could not reflect the fact that he or she remained
liable for the full amount of the outstanding mortgage.'
Richard Barnett, of Barnett Sampson, said the court's decision would
'relieve the tremendous worry caused to many denied proper compensation.'
The Securities and Investments Board (SIB) - the chief regulatory body for
the financial services industry, which manages the ICS - said it now
expected another 150 new claims. The ICS has paid out Pounds 16.3m to 1,300
investors so far.
This figure does not cover compensation to investors who bought a plan after
bad advice from a salesman 'tied' to an insurance company. They can complain
to Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life industry and, if eligible
for compensation, will get it from the life office involved. SIB has a help
desk to guide those who have not yet made a claim but think they might have
grounds. Contact SIB Home Income Scheme Help Desk, Gavrelle House, 2-14
Bunhill Row, London EC1.

ON THURSDAY, Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group,
reports its first interim results without its bioscience business, Zeneca.
Industry analysts' forecasts reckon pre-tax profits will be down from last
year's Pounds 159m (excluding exceptionals) to about Pounds 140m. Figures
will also be given for the old ICI, which included Zeneca. The performance
of the industrial chemicals division will also be watched closely. Its
titanium dioxide and caustic businesses are struggling, but chemicals and
polymers are expected to post significant improvements.
Zeneca also reports its half-year results on Thursday. Analysts expect it to
report pre-tax profits at between Pounds 330m and Pounds 340m. Of particular
interest will be the performance of the pharmaceuticals division.
Reuters, the international information and news group, is expected to report
an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 187m to about Pounds 210m
on Tuesday. Interest will centre on whether the group plans to distribute
some of its Pounds 710m cash pile to shareholders - and on the progress of
new dealing systems such as Globex, for financial futures and options
markets; and Dealing 2000-2, the automated foreign exchange product.
BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, is expected to show
increased interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday. Despite concerns about the
prospects for the group's US tobacco business, profits are predicted to rise
to Pounds 710m-Pounds 780m (Pounds 672m a year earlier). Eagle Star, the
non-life insurance subsidiary, is gradually recovering profitability
following increases in premium rates and a fall-off in weather-related
claims.
The interim reporting season for clearing banks starts on Friday with
Lloyds, which is expected to show less of a rebound in profits than others
because of greater consistency in earnings in the past two years.
Lloyds is also expected to be under pressure in its net interest income
because its UK loan book has been contracting. But analysts expect it to
benefit from around Pounds 100m of release of less developed country debt.
Analysts expect a rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 450m-Pounds 560m (Pounds
369m). Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are expected to fall to between
Pounds 250m and Pounds 270m from Pounds 347m.
British Telecommunications is reporting first-quarter results on Wednesday.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 780m (Pounds 731m) are likely.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: When money talks - International
bond funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL bond funds usually aim for maximum total returns from their
investments in government and corporate bonds around the world. Currency
gains have led to healthy growth for funds in this sector recently,
particularly since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. But yields
generally are lower than for funds invested in UK gilts.
Some fund managers now say the time for massive gains from currency plays
has passed. 'It is unlikely sterling is going to devalue again,' says
Christopher Rothery, manager of Save &amp; Prosper's international bond fund. 'I
think the returns we are looking at over the next year are going to be more
modest, but you can still say they are attractive.'
Currency gains are still possible in some areas, though. 'We believe that
the dollar will continue to appreciate against European currencies this
year, and the yen is still fundamentally strong,' says Rothery.
The S &amp; P fund is weighted heavily in the US and Canada compared with some
other funds in this sector, with a total of 42 per cent invested in North
America. It has 17 per cent in Japan, about 20 per cent in the UK, and 19
per cent in continental Europe.
Letitia Ash-Lameer, who manages Norwich Union's international bond fund,
shares a positive view of the US dollar but is weighted less heavily in the
US. 'We prefer Canada,' she says. 'We are still looking for rate cuts in
Canada, but we are not looking for any more in the US.'
The tensions in the ERM also are worrying managers. Ash-Lameer hedges
investments in the weaker ERM members - such as Spain, Sweden and Denmark -
into US dollars to reduce the risk. Her fund is invested 17 per cent in the
UK, 16 per cent in the US and 14.5 per cent in Canada, with smaller amounts
in European countries and Australia.
Whittingdale's fund in this sector is rather a special case, as it is US
dollar-denominated and invests only in short-dated US government bonds. Its
performance in sterling terms is determined by the strength of the dollar.
'It is not an ordinary international bond fund,' says Whittingdale's Jeremy
Alford.
'The fund is really there for people who either want to match US dollar
liabilities, which is not that easy in this country, or who share our view
that the dollar is undervalued.' Minimum investment is Dollars 2,000, with
an initial charge of 1.25 per cent and an annual charge of 1 per cent.
Minimum for the Norwich Union fund is Pounds 500, or Pounds 30 a month with
a savings plan. The initial charge is 6 per cent, and 1.25 per cent annual
management fee. The initial charge on the S &amp; P fund is 5.5 per cent, with
an annual charge of 0.75 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or
Pounds 35 monthly.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Ethical investment - honest, or just
hype? / The sector is small but has been growing steadily. Yet, some say it
is no more than a marketing tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOW CLEAR is your conscience? Ever since the market in ethical and
environmental funds started to grow late in the 1980s, there has been a
suspicion that they are more a marketing tool than a wholehearted attempt to
offer investors the choice of putting money into companies meeting a series
of moral criteria.
The amount placed in these funds has been rising steadily, although it
remains a very small market. Some Pounds 365m was invested in
ethical/environmental unit trusts by May 1993 compared with Pounds 283m in
July 1991, according to the Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris);
this monitors the activities of UK companies to see if they meet the
required criteria.
Most ethical/environmental funds are unit trusts but there is also a
smattering of investment trusts, such as Jupiter Tyndall Merlin's
International Green. Commercial Union runs an environmental pension fund,
while Henderson offers a Green personal equity plan and Homeowners, a
friendly society, has a Green Chip growth bond.
The type of fund you choose depends very much on your own views about a
given issue. Take Eagle Star's Environmental Opportunities fund, which might
seem a non-starter for many since the company is owned by BAT, the tobacco
group.
Eagle Star denies it is an ethical fund and says the trust 'should not in
any way be labelled a green trust; neither is it an ethical trust. We are
not making moral judgments.' Nevertheless, the company says its main aim is
to invest in 'far-sighted' companies which take a positive attitude to
environmental issues.
If you do not think tobacco is an environmental issue, this is not a
problem. But if you regard smoking as 'pollution,' you will not think of
this as a 'true' environmental fund.
Greener than White?
Idealists will find it difficult to find a perfect fund, partly because of
the different criteria chosen by the trusts. Some green funds will invest in
companies trying to clean up their act by using environmentally friendly
materials in their offices.
Others will invest in companies producing goods and services which
contribute to the environment, without taking a view on the shade of green
adopted by the management of the company.
John Allan, of Clerical Medical's Evergreen fund, says: 'We would avoid
investing in companies such as British Petroleum or Shell oil.
'But others will invest on the basis that these companies are involved in
research into the environment and are making efforts to clean up their act.'
A survey in this month's issue of Which?, the Consumer's Association
magazine, gives plenty of ground for disillusionment and would appear to
confirm the cynical view of ethical/environmental funds as marketing hype.
Its investigation, into 17 of them, found that none managed to avoid
completely five areas of ethical or environmental concern.
Only three of the funds - Ethical Investment, Friends Provident Stewardship
and Scottish Equitable - said they avoided companies where they were unable
to monitor investments.
The criteria chosen by Which? were animal testing, weapons, oppressive
regimes, political donations and green issues such as pollution, nuclear
power and ozone-depleting chemicals.
Some funds scored particularly low marks, although the criteria used did not
necessarily match the funds' own. TSB Environmental Investor rated the
lowest over animal exploitation because it invests in Unilever, which tests
cosmetics on animals.
Abtrust's ethical fund fared poorly in avoiding companies linked with making
or supplying arms because of an investment in Weir Group, the engineering
company which manufactures missile launching systems for nuclear submarines.
Abtrust, however, has sold its holding in Weir and says the company had been
under review for some time because of its activities.
The Environ trust run by Co-Operative Insurance (CIS) also fell short in the
survey. It has a holding in BOC, the industrial gases and drugs group which
has subsidiaries in countries such as China, condemned by Amnesty
International for human rights abuses.
Environ also has a stake in Siebe, an engineering company which makes parts
for nuclear submarines and has a subsidiary in South Africa which pays low
wages, according to Eiris.
Environ does avoid companies which, among other criteria, make more than 10
per cent of their turnover in countries with oppressive regimes, or in
arms-related activities. 'If you dig deep enough, you could find fault with
any company,' says David Mott, of CIS. 'We think we have been successful in
striking a balance between good investment returns and establishing criteria
which the average, caring investor would be happy with.'
Performance
CIS argues that it adopts a more relaxed policy than some funds in order to
assist performance, and this appears to be borne out by the table.
It was the second highest-performer of any ethical/green fund in the
international growth sector in the three years to July 1, although it has
not matched that performance in the year to July 1.
By contrast, Clerical Medical's Evergreen - which, along with Friends
Provident and Scottish Equitable's ethical fund, came out best in the Which?
survey - is second from bottom over the three years to July 1. It invests in
companies where a major part of the business lies in making a contribution
to the environment, but excludes those where other operations might cause
damage to the environment.
'This automatically means that we have a narrow band of companies which we
can invest in,' says Allan. 'Performance is affected to the same degree as
any fund limited to a narrow band, such as a single country emerging market
fund.'
Most of the companies involved in providing goods and services of the
environmental type tend to be small, so performance often can be volatile.
Ethical/green unit trusts underperformed the average for the two sectors
listed in the table in the year to July 1, but have outperformed the average
in the three and five years to the same date.
This should give cheer to idealists who also want good returns. 'Investors
should look around to find a fund that best meets their own principles,'
says Eiris.
'Some people may not find them perfect but, for many, one or more of these
funds will get them much closer to their ideal.'
And to a clearer conscience, Eiris could have added.
To celebrate its ninth anniversary, Friends Provident is offering an extra 1
per cent unit allocation for new investments of more than Pounds 3,000 into
Stewardship, the largest ethical fund.
The offer runs to September 17.

Other fixed rate offers, ranging from 6.75 per cent (APR 7 per cent) fixed
for 15 months, to 8.95 per cent (APR 9.5 per cent) fixed for 10 years.
Arrangement fees vary between Pounds 200 and Pounds 300, and early
redemption penalties range between 60 days' interest and 300 days' interest.
All mortgages are portable.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Leasehold act becomes law - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act became law this
week. The new law will mean that from November 1, some of the 750,000 owners
of long leaseholds on flats in the UK will be able either to club together
to buy the freehold of their block (enfranchise) or to extend their leases.
Some owners of leasehold houses will also be able to buy their freeholds.
Whether or not a block is eligible for enfranchisement will depend on: the
number of flats in the block; whether the ground rent is classified as low;
the amount of retail or commercial floorspace in the block; whether the
landlord also lives in the block; whether at least half the leaseholders
wishing to enfranchise occupy their flats as their principal residence, or
have done for three of the past 10 years.

At a glance

<TEXT>
Savers withdrew more money from building societies than they deposited in
June, creating a net outflow of Pounds 56m. This followed a net inflow of
Pounds 700m in May and more than Pounds 1bn in April. The net inflow for the
second quarter as a whole was Pounds 1.7bn, compared to Pounds 77m in the
same period last year. The Building Societies Association blamed June's
outflow on seasonal factors combined with the BT3 share offer, for which
many savers withdrew money.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: Retailers - not a super market / The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ALISTAIR Grant, chairman of Argyll, may be rereading his statement to
the group's annual meeting this week to find out just what he said to upset
the City so much. His statement, although generally positive, knocked 11p
off the share price of Argyll, which owns the Safeway superstore chain, and
precipitated another round of downgrades of analysts' profits forecasts for
the big food retailers.
There seems to be little anyone can do to lift the sector, which has
underperformed the stock market by more than 10 per cent since January.
The main fear is that intensifying competition and a growing price
sensitivity among consumers means the big grocery chains cannot sustain the
spectacular profit growth enjoyed in the last 10 years.
There are two elements to this. One is the fear that the UK food market is
approaching saturation, that there is room for only so many superstores
before they start 'cannibalising' each other's sales.
The second factor is the rapid spread of discount retailers, which cut costs
and margins to the minimum and concentrate on offering the lowest possible
prices.
The 'big three' grocery chains, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, have played
down these threats. Only Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the UK's
number four, has broken ranks to warn that the 'halcyon days' of food
retailing are at an end.
Recently, a third threat has emerged: low inflation. While the government
has made strenuous efforts to reduce it, inflation is, in some ways, the
retailer's friend. Inflation means the value of a retailer's stock rises
between the time goods are bought and re-sold to the consumer, boosting the
profit margin. Low inflation means retailers have to be more efficient and
cut costs to maintain or increase margins.
Although Sir Alistair made some negative noises about 'highly competitive
trading conditions', inflation was the real reason the markets reacted badly
to his statement.
He said current inflation, at just under 1.5 per cent excluding petrol, was
'below our expectation of some modest food price inflation . . . The current
year is likely to be somewhat more challenging than anticipated a few weeks
ago.'
What is strange about the slide in share prices, is that it has affected
almost all the big food retailers, except for Asda, which is staging a
recovery after getting into financial difficulties at the end of the 1980s.
Analysts believe the sector will bounce eventually, but only those companies
who are perceived to have got their formula right will gain.
'It's true that it's dog eat dog in food retailing, but some of them are
rottweilers, and others are poodles,' says Bill Currie of BZW. 'The big dogs
will eat the little dogs.'
Sainsbury is agreed to be the rottweiler of the sector. Its shares are
recommended by most analysts. Some favour Argyll, but there are fears about
its spending on expansion. Tesco, however, is widely out of favour. It has a
younger customer base than its rivals, which has been hit harder by the
recession and is seen as more susceptible to the charms of the discounters.
Opinions differ on Asda. It is seen as a recovery stock, but many analysts
believe its price is already high enough.
Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based regional superstore operator which was voted
the UK's top-performing company by the Institute of Directors, has many
supporters in the City.
Among the discounters, Kwik Save, the oldest and biggest, is recommended by
some. But other analysts fear its decision to extend its range has left it
in 'no man's land', as neither a limited-range, deep discounter, nor a
discount superstore, and it may lose sales as a result.
Shoprite, the fast-expanding chain which operates mainly in Scotland, is the
only quoted deep discounter and some analysts believe it offers significant
growth potential.
But with few opportunities for good news before Tesco's interim results and
Asda's AGM in September, the sector may continue its downward drift for a
while. Those holding the stronger shares are not advised to sell, but for
those who do not, there is probably no rush to buy.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: An essential reading list for the hols - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH summer holidays upon us, thoughts are turning to reading material for
those long, lazy days on the beach. Here is a selection of the latest
business books which should ensure that the time is productively employed.
The View from Number 11, by Kenneth Clarke
Not the memoirs of the same name by Nigel Lawson, but an instant book from
the new chancellor containing his views on the economy, as related to the
Treasury select committee. He believes Britain is experiencing 'an all-round
recovery'. But Clarke recognises the problem of the Pounds 50bn budget
deficit, hinting that tax increases are to come? Drawing on positive recent
economic statistics, such as the rise in retail sales and the strength of
exports in June, Clarke propounds his theory that the recovery is
'incipient'. His views have since been confirmed by second quarter growth
figures showing a rise of 0.5 per cent. A revised edition of this book will
be published on November 30.
Privatisations. The Warburg guide to selling state assets.
At last the definitive work on the subject. But sadly this book appears
after the completion of the last UK privatisation of any size for some years
to come, though the book is being translated into French. Taking the BT3
sale as its example, Warburg shows how a privatisation can be played to give
investors a premium on day one, without falling into the
selling-assets-on-the-cheap trap. Some private investors who bought through
share shops and have been unable to sell without their share certificates,
may not agree with the Warburg thesis that perfection in privatisations has
been reached.
Is the Stock Market going up? by A Guru, of Puffit and Floggit,
stockbrokers.
Despite all this good economic news the equity market has been doggedly
refusing to rise. A leading stockmarket commentator explains why he thinks
the market is still cheap - based partly on the technical view that the
Footsie index is oversold, and 2800 provides a floor. Friday's recovery from
an opening 20 point fall backs up that idea.
Guru also suggests that strong export growth will begin to show up in
corporate earnings figures in the coming interim results reporting season,
underpinning p/e ratios. Further, the UK market is looking cheap compared to
other European stock markets. However, he admits, loss of momentum in the
gilt-edged market is not helping the equity market.
Free the Belgravia One by Asil Nadir.
Unfortunately legal restricitions prevent us disclosing anything about this
book, published and distributed at the author's own expense. Drug Research:
is it worth the candle? by Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots
A bitter man, Sir James. But who could blame him? After pouring over Pounds
100m into researching Manoplax, a drug for heart failure, and finally
getting it to the market he then had to withdraw the drug within months. His
only consolation must be that the stock market had long since given up the
idea that Manoplax would be the motor for Boots profit growth in the 1990s
and Boots shares actually rose on the publication. But will Boots now give
up ethical drug research altogether? We will have to wait for the sequel.
Up like a rocket, down like a stick, by Bernard Taylor and Bill Rooney.
Why is it that the most spectacular rises so often lead to the most
uncomfortable falls? Taking Medeva and Spring Ram as examples - with Sage
Group, the software company, covered in a footnote - the authors completely
fail to explain what went wrong. Ian Gowrie-Smith, Taylor's associate at
drugs company Medeva, remarks: 'We are still en route to being one of the
most successful companies in corporate British history.' This is in spite of
the halving of the share price on the day the company warned on current year
profits. Meanwhile, Bill Rooney, of Spring Ram, was still clutching the jar
of magic beans to which he attributed the group's earlier success as
institutional investors in the kitchen and bathroom company kept up the
pressure for him to stand down. A postscript from Taylor admits Medeva needs
to 'rebuild investor confidence', hardly a profound conclusion.
How to make a Billion in Property, by George Soros and Alastair Ross Goobey,
with a foreword by Gerald Ronson
A sequel to Soros's bestseller, How to make a Billion in the Foreign
Exchanges, this book will be of particular interest to those convinced that
what comes down must go up. Aside from Ronson's quip in the foreword - start
with two billion - Soros and Ross Goobey set out their view that the
property market is cheap. Putting their money where the mouths are Soros has
already backed a deal with British Land, and Ross Goobey has rescued
Greycoat. This week Ross Goobey used another Pounds 62m of the Postel
pension fund to buy three of Ronson's properties.
The House of Fraser Sale, published by SG Warburg.
And finally, one for next year's holiday. Promised by the publishers this
week, the history and prospectus for this long established department store
group, although omitting the tale of Harrods, the best known of all. It is
to be hoped the book will answer the many questions which have surrounded
this business. Just who are the mysterious, eastern, Fayed brothers? Why do
they want to sell this prestigious business which they acquired only eight
years ago? How has it performed under their leadership? Can Tiny Rowland, of
Lonrho, put a spoke in the wheel? What will readers discover in the small
print at the back of the book? A thriller destined to become a bestseller.
Good reading and happy holidays.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: Buffeted equities emerge unscathed again - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN, the stock markets have been buffeted by the rapidly shifting
winds of corporate earnings, economic fundamentals, monetary policy and bond
price movements and, once again, they have emerged unscathed. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average even managed to set a record high during the week when it
closed at 3,555.40 on Wednesday. That achievement, however, was marred by
the failure of other indices to match its performance.
On the same day the Dow peaked, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq
composite and the American Stock Exchange composite all fell - an indication
that the buying which lifted the Dow into previously unexplored territory
was limited to a few leading stocks.
There was a further qualification to Wednesday's record-breaking gains: they
were achieved in the final minutes of business on the back of a series of
late computer program trades. And the fact that prices dropped sharply on
Thursday suggested that investors viewed the markets' breakthrough as an
opportunity to profits, not celebrate.
By midday yesterday, stocks were about back where they started the week.
Clearly, the equity markets remain trapped in a trading range between 3,450
and 3,550 on the Dow and, barring a big move from the Federal Reserve on
monetary policy or a dramatic shift in bond yields, they will probably stay
in that range for the rest of the summer.
The performance of corporate America appears unlikely to break the pattern,
although a cluster of surprisingly bullish second-quarter earnings' reports
were disclosed this week. There were strong showings from a wide variety of
industry groupings, including Sears, Roebuck (retailers); American and Delta
(airlines); Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Salomon and Primerica (banks and
financial services groups); Texaco and Exxon (oil companies); Lockheed and
McDonnell Douglas (defence and aviation contractors; and SmithKline Beecham,
Schering-Plough and Merck (pharmaceuticals companies).
A large part of the quarterly reporting season is now out of the way,
although IBM has yet to announce its earnings. (This week, IBM shares
dropped to their lowest since 1975 as investors anticipated that the
computer group would announce further job cuts when it publishes its results
next week). For a couple of reasons, though, the latest batch of good
earnings news had little positive impact upon the markets as a whole.
First, the latest quarterly results represent snapshots of past performance.
Investors are much more interested in the future, and how well corporate
profits will hold up during what could be a sustained period of weak
economic growth. Second, with markets at or near record highs, many stocks
are looking expensive and strong earnings are priced into share values
already.
If corporate profitability is not greatly influencing equity markets, then
what is? The answer: interest rates and bond prices, the same factors that
have dominated stock market sentiment for the best part of a year. Share
prices are hovering around record highs because interest rates and bond
yields are hovering near record lows. Yet, share prices are struggling to
break from a narrow trading range and move any higher because many investors
fear that interest rates and bond yields may have bottomed.
These fears were not soothed by this week's comments from Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve. In his semi-annual Humphrey Hawkins address
to Congress, he made a series of statements about inflation, the economic
outlook and interest rates that unsettled the bond market and further
rattled equity investors' already frazzled nerves.
There was nothing particularly new or shocking in what he said. He indicated
he was ready to raise interest rates at any time if warranted by inflation,
although he remained cautious about the inflation outlook in spite of
welcome improvements in recent consumer and producer price data.
In ordinary times, the bond and stock markets might have taken Greenspan's
remarks in their stride. But these are not ordinary times. Bond yields are
at record lows, share prices are near record highs, and investors are quick
to sell at the first hint of higher interest rates. There is little doubt
that rates will be raised sometime within the next six to 12 months. In an
accurate, but not particularly helpful, phrase, Greenspan said on Thursday
that a tightening of monetary policy was 'somewhere out there.'
The only question is: can corporate profitability and economic growth
improve sufficiently quickly so that, when a rate rise comes, the stock
markets will be strong enough to take it on the chin and stay upright?

FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: 'Advice' that you can do without - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNBIASED financial advice is hard to get. Unlike the legal, medical and
accountancy professions, where most people's worries are confined to whether
the adviser is clever or affordable, the financial services industry is
warped by a peculiar and intractable distortion - commission. It is
dominated by the large life offices which pay commission to salesman to sell
their products. The rationale is the old industry adage that people do not
buy insurance - they must be sold it.
Sale by commission is not confined to insurance products. It extends to
other investments such as unit trusts and even to deposit-based savings such
as some tax-exempt special savings accounts (when sold through an adviser).
There are two particular problems with the commission system. One is that
people do not know what proportion of their premiums is being used to pay
the commission - ie, they do not know the overall 'cost' of their
investment. The other is that payment by commission causes a potential
conflict of interest for the adviser, who might have to choose between
giving good advice and earning a living.
The Financial Services Act, which established the regulatory system, tried
to address some of the problems by dividing those who can sell products by
commission into two categories: the 'tied' agent, who can sell only the
policies of one company, and the independent financial adviser, who can
choose between products offered by the whole industry.
Tied agents must declare their affiliation before selling a product. This
will be familiar to many people who have taken out a mortgage in the past
five years, since almost all the large banks and building societies are tied
to a single life office.
There can be few people who would consult a doctor if they knew he was paid
by the drug companies to sell their medicine. He might be under pressure to
meet a sales target for a certain number of headache pills if he did not
want to be fired. This would hardly seem a desirable state of affairs.
Yet, the life offices are good at producing surveys showing consumers are
happy with the commission system. This is because many people do not
appreciate the way the system works.
Say, for instance, you want an endowment policy. Would you prefer to pay an
adviser to sell it to you or would you rather have the life company pay the
adviser?
Given that question, you might choose the latter. But, in fact, you end up
paying the adviser either way because the life company pays him out of your
premiums.
Although there are many hard-working and scrupulous commission-based
independent financial advisers, there are also many who are not, as the
plight of those misled into buying risky home income plans (see page IV) has
demonstrated amply. But the information gathered suggests that the greatest
problems have been caused by the tied agents and direct sales forces of the
life companies.
Anthony Nelson, economics secretary to the Treasury, who this week took an
important step to improve the system, said he had been alarmed by the high
lapse rates in the life industry - an indication as sure as any that people
are being sold policies they are either do not want or cannot afford. A
report by management consultant AKG showed that, in 1991, up to one quarter
of new life and pension policies lapsed within a year of their sale.
Policies sold by a direct sales force or a tied agent have the highest lapse
rates.
The action Nelson has taken is to order the regulators to draft rules
obliging both tied agents and IFAs to reveal the amount of commission they
receive when they recommend a product. He also wants companies to tell
consumers the effect the charges will have on their investment, by stating
the amount by which their investment is reduced as a result of the charges.
In ordering these and other changes, he has acted upon and extended the
scope of recommendations made by the Office of Fair Trading in March.
The industry is still drawing its breath before deciding what to do, but
most IFAs and life offices are not pleased. IFA Promotion, an association
representing the interests of IFAs, said yesterday: 'We are somewhat
disappointed that the chancellor sees commission disclosure as vital to the
consumer.'
Standard Life, one of the largest offices, has been blunter. 'The
chancellor's decisions are not what we were hoping for, especially in
relation to disclosure of commission and longer term surrender values,' said
spokesman Tom King. But the Consumers' Association is delighted.
The Treasury's action is certainly good news for the consumer, but the life
insurance industry has been adept at turning adverse circumstances to its
advantage. The danger is that the industry will adopt policies which will
succeed in frustrating the spirit of the Treasury's action when the new
rules are drawn up.
Finally, the measures still do not confront the central problem of providing
unbiased advice to those who seek it. Consumers can go to fee-based
advisers. This is a small market although it would expand were the
commission system eroded. Until this happens, consumers will have to
continue their hard search for unbiased financial advice.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Victims of Vichy, victims of France: Suppressing Vichy's
shame helped restore French morale and unity after the war. But how, 50
years on, can the Republic now respond honourably to the suffering of
victims? asks Robert Cottrell
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT COTTRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE deranged killer of Rene Bousquet, the former Vichy government police
chief, acted criminally in the eyes of the French authorities, it must also
be said that he acted conveniently. Bousquet's murder on June 8 came barely
a month before France's first annual day of official remembrance for victims
of Vichy's 'racist and anti-semitic persecutions.'
As a result, when prime minister Edouard Balladur delivered his remembrance
day speech in Paris on July 16, he was no longer obliged to explain how the
man who had organised many of those 'racist and anti-semitic persecutions'
was still leading, at 84, the comfortable life of a retired banker barely a
mile away on the Avenue Raphael.
Though coincidental, the death of Bousquet and the introduction of a
remembrance day for Vichy's victims have dramatised a national dilemma for
France in which history, morality and politics each plays a part: the
dilemma of whether Vichy, the wartime government of Marshal Philippe Petain,
which sought to lead a defeated and part-occupied France along the 'way of
collaboration' with Hitler, is a chapter of French history best remembered,
or best forgotten.
The inaugurating of a remembrance day may argue that the first of those
sentiments - to remember - has gained the high ground. But Rene Bousquet,
while he lived, proved the enduring power of those who would rather forget.
He displayed to his end a grim confidence that he would never be required to
face trial for his part in the deportation of some 75,000 Jews from France
to the Nazi death-camps.
'If they want to mess with me,' he said shortly before his death, 'then fine
. . . I will defend myself, and I have the material to do so. But I will be
utterly astonished if the trial takes place.'
It was with Bousquet's authority that French police arrested 13,000 Jews in
Paris on July 16-17 1942, including 4,000 children whom even the Nazis had
been willing to spare. Most were held in the Velodrome d'Hiver, a
since-demolished bicycle-track, before being sent to French-run
concentration camps south of Paris - and thence to Auschwitz.
The date of the start of that round-up having been fixed for the new
remembrance day, the ceremony in Paris was held at the site of the
Velodrome, where unofficial ceremonies have taken place in past years. In
the course of a short and solemn speech, the prime minister declared that
France was 'in mourning,' and repeated the promise given by President
Francois Mitterrand that a monument would be erected 'to perpetuate the
memory of what took place here.'
Until that monument arises, the perpetuation of memory will rest heavily on
the work of Serge Klarsfeld, the French lawyer and Nazi-hunter who published
his investigation of Bousquet 10 years ago in a book called Vichy-Auschwitz.
Impelled by Klarsfeld, the French public prosecutor eventually charged
Bousquet in 1991 with 'crimes against humanity' (which under French law
enjoy no statute of limitation); but the case vanished into such thickets of
procedural delay that the prospective defendant was not alone in his doubts
that it would ever reach court.
Bousquet had already walked free from one post-war trial in 1949 because the
courts at that time were concerned with treason, not genocide, even though
the leaders of Vichy had furthered both causes. A half-century later, he was
the last survivor of those who planned the worst of Vichy's persecutions. To
that extent, his death has given one irreversible victory to those who think
Vichy best forgotten.
The possibility has been lost for ever of a great pedagogical trial which
might have examined and judged not only Bousquet himself, but also, through
him, the regime of which he was a part. French courts may yet try Paul
Touvier, a former officer in the collaborationist Militia, for alleged war
crimes. But Touvier was a relatively low-level figure, and is in any case
charged with acting on the orders of the Gestapo, not of Vichy.
To explain the last and decisive hesitations of French justice in respect of
the Bousquet case, Klarsfeld and others have pointed a finger at President
Mitterrand, who worked for the Vichy government from 1941-42 before entering
the resistance. Mitterrand reputedly met Bousquet in Vichy, and they moved
in the same political circles after the war.
Klarsfeld suggests that Mitterrand may nurse a 'nostalgia for his youth.' It
is, at any rate, an observable truth that the further the French president's
motives and actions extend into his past, the more impenetrable they become.
If Mitterrand did indeed choose discreetly to discourage Bousquet's trial,
then he may well have done so partly out of a political judgment that such a
trial would not be in the public interest; partly out of a personal loyalty;
and partly out of that strange private reservoir of affections which has
also led him to send a bouquet of roses to Marshal Petain's tomb each
November 11, the anniversary of the ending of the first world war.
Only after a barrage of criticism from his friends as well as political
rivals last November did the president finally concede that he would have to
find a way of managing differently the 'contradictions of history.' His
decree, three months later, instituting the remembrance day for Marshal
Petain's victims, must be read as a realisation of that promise.
In opposing a judicial reopening of the great questions of Vichy, President
Mitterrand would also have been echoing the policy of France since the
Liberation. It was General de Gaulle who recognised in 1944 that France
could scarcely take its place among the victors of the second world war if
it also acknowledged the realities of the armistice and the collaboration
over which the Vichy government had presided.
His response was to decree that the French Third Republic had assigned power
unconstitutionally to Marshal Petain in June 1940; that the Vichy government
had been illegal from its formation; and that the armistice concluded by
Petain with Germany had been void. To efface what had once been the
substance of Vichy, the Gaullists substituted their insistence that the
'true' France had never surrendered; that the flame of legitimate government
had been carried through its dark hour by de Gaulle's Free French forces;
and that the mass of ordinary people remaining in France had manifested
their loyalty by resisting the Nazi occupant.
It necessarily followed from the Gaullist version of history that atrocities
which had taken place in wartime France must have been attributable to
Germans, not Frenchmen. The plain fact that the Vichy government had devised
and implemented a policy of Jewish persecution, initially of its own
volition and later as the French contribution to the Nazi genocide, was -
with its potentially devastating implications for France's reputation - the
most taboo subject of all, and one which the specially-convened High Court
of Justice showed absolutely no disposition to pursue in its post-war trials
of Vichy officials.
Thus Bousquet, among the last defendants to go before the court, faced no
serious questioning about his role in the arrest and deportation of Jews
from France, and the documentary evidence in his prosecution file went
unexamined.
Suppressing the shame of Vichy helped restore the morale and the unity of
France. But it also impeded the drawing of lessons about how and why the
machinery of French government had in reality passed very smoothly into
Petain's hands.
Not until May 1992, for example, did the national training centre for the
French police force feel able to conduct its first internal seminars on
police work during the war, the Ministry of the Interior having judged,
according to Le Monde, 'that the wounds were sufficiently healed for
reflection to be undertaken at the institutional level.'
Those who attended the seminars were reminded that Nazi Germany had been
able, with only 3,000 members of its own security services operating in
France, to secure the arrest and deportation from France of 75,000 Jews and
40,000 resistants, as well as to supply itself with 650,000 French forced
labourers.
Had the French police refused to do the Nazis' work, Germany would have been
obliged either to commit much more of its own manpower to France, or else
reduce the scale of its oppressions there.
Today, if arguments still rage about the motives and the intentions of
Petain's government, the concrete actions of Vichy are neither denied nor
deniable.
The problem which remains is one of political acceptance. The victims of
Vichy were persecuted on French soil, by agents of a French government, in
conformity with the French law of the day.
Can a formula be found by which the Republic of France may respond
honourably to the suffering of Vichy's victims, and yet still, as it
believes it must, avoid identifying their tormentors at least to some degree
with France itself?
According to Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the former French defence minister,
the danger of blurring the distinction between the 'Vichy' and the 'France'
of 1940-44 remains that France would then 'stand with Germany, Italy and
Japan in the fascist camp which lost the second world war . . . Her
permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, with right of
veto, would lose its justification . . . By going down that road, France
would abdicate its place in the world.'
If Chevenement's warnings appear exaggerated, they reflect well enough
France's acute sensitivity to its 'rank,' particularly in relation to
Germany within Europe.
Yet as the decades pass, and as death claims both the tormentors and
survivors of Vichy, the justification for denying Vichy so absolutely must
appear increasingly open to question, if the legacy and the lessons of Vichy
are to be rooted enduringly in France's memory.
In the view of Alfred Grosser, France's leading political scientist: 'Let us
not make-believe that the Vichy regime was a little island standing apart
from French society, or that the ruling class of France went into
hibernation until the parenthesis was closed and the Republic could resume
its interrupted life.
'The victims of Vichy, French and non-French alike, were indeed the victims
of France. A France with a twisted expression, but a France which stands
clearly within the continuity of its own history.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / The Long View: Time for franc talking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR might have been able to enjoy a quiet gloat over the renewed
plight of the French franc this week if only he had not had one or two other
small matters on his mind.
The real irony of the Westminster battle, perhaps, is that it has been all
about a treaty which is apparently in the process of being undermined by the
foreign exchange markets, anyway. All the elaborate plans for a smooth and
orderly transition to economic and monetary union are being tested to
destruction as recession-hit Europe sado-masochistically raises its
short-term interest rates: this week, they hit 8 per cent in Belgium, 10 per
cent in France, and more like 20 per cent in Denmark and Spain.
It is possible that the link between the franc and the D-mark can survive
another weekend. But the fragility of the European Monetary System has been
emphasised once again, and there is precious little indication that the
lessons have really been taken on board.
Economic craziness usually stems from well-meaning political imperatives.
The French, in the post-war era, have always been committed to building
close relationships with Germany: this was, after all, the original central
purpose of the European Community. One result was the Maastricht treaty and
the strategy of the franc fort which, through its unquestionable stability
against the D-mark, would reflect political as well as economic convergence.
The objective even transcended party politics and the Socialists duly
trooped to political disaster in the April election, happy to have won the
'battle of the franc.'
British attitudes have been vastly different, of course. In 1990, John Major
put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism largely because there was a
short-term problem with inflation, which had hit 10.9 per cent, and an
associated crisis over 15 per cent interest rates.
Inside the ERM, there was a chance that interest rates could come down; and,
indeed, they did for a while. But once the British economy had slid into
recession, much lower interest rates still were appropriate. By the summer
of last year, a banking crisis loomed, making it highly dangerous to raise
rates again to defend sterling's parity.
A year later, we seem to have a re-run of the 1992 summer crisis, this time
with the French under fire. Last year, the French economy was still
expanding, but this time it is in quite deep recession and will contract by
approaching 1 per cent in 1993, according to the latest forecasts. High
interest rates are becoming not just awkward but dangerous.
It has been all rather predictable; and yet, the EC Monetary Committee
decided in May that there were no serious 'fault lines' in the EMS. But,
they said, exchange rate adjustments should remain a crucial feature of the
system and fundamental disequilibria should be recognised early. Moreover
Germany, as the anchor country, should be ready to raise taxes rather than
run an excessively tight monetary policy which would impose intolerable
interest rates upon other member states.
This is, needless to say, all pie in the sky. Run by dispassionate
economists, the ERM might stand a slight chance; but, in practice, it is at
the mercy of politicians who are not always known for being flexible and
pragmatic.
Should Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, increase taxes on German
voters in order to help out the French or the Danes? It is a nice idea, but
there is no political mechanism to make it happen.
Extreme cyclical pressures have also exposed weaknesses in the system. Its
flexibility has been limited mostly to one-off exchange rate adjustments
intended to reflect permanent changes in competitiveness. But recent
difficulties have not really concerned relative costs or inflation but have
been about interest rates where Germany, for the time being, needs a
significantly higher level than France or the UK. Purely temporary changes
in exchange rates up and down would destroy the point of a fixed-rate
system. But if inappropriate interest rates are applied for too long, the
system must collapse, anyway.
The right approach would have been to accept, about two years ago, that the
economic shocks resulting from the re-unification of Germany required that
the D-mark should be floated or, at any rate, permitted a sharp
up-valuation. But the French analysis was that the German upheavals made it
even more essential politically that the currency link should be maintained
and re-emphasised. It has a crazy logic and you have to admire men of
principle - but, usually, it is wiser to follow practical chaps.
In the past few months, too, the example of the UK has become increasingly
embarrassing for the French. When sterling was pulled out of the ERM last
September, the continentals nodded knowingly: the feckless Brits had opted
for the easy, inflationary way out once again. In fact, the British economy
has responded encouragingly to the opportunities outside the ERM, and
yesterday's figures of an upturn in second-quarter GDP were in stark
contrast to what is going on in any country with a currency tied to the
D-mark.
Moreover, what goes down can come up again: the pound tumbled to 7.9 francs
at one stage five months ago, but the rate is now near 9. Left to float, the
franc could soon become much stronger than the mark.
Perhaps the monetary committee members should compile another report. I
believe they should conclude that progress towards an ever-closer union must
be led by political initiatives, behind which can follow economic
integration. Exchange rates should come second, not first.
As for John Major, he might ponder on the response of sterling and the gilt
market as he faced political extinction this week: they turned not a hair at
the prospect of his fall. That is not much of a vote of confidence.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Ex-Ferruzzi chief in apparent suicide

MR RAUL GARDINI, 60-year-old former chairman of Ferruzzi, Italy's second
biggest private sector company, was found in his Milan apartment yesterday
with a single shot to the head, an apparent suicide.
Mr Gardini was rushed to the first-aid unit of a nearby hospital, where he
was dead on arrival.
Magistrates were investigating Mr Gardini among others over alleged
corruption and illicit financing of political parties.
Yesterday afternoon an arrest warrant was issued for Mr Carlo Sama, the
former chief executive officer of Montedison, the controlling company of
Ferruzzi. Mr Sama is married to a daughter of the late Serafino Ferruzzi,
the company's founder.
Warrants were also issued for Mr Vittorio Giuliani Ricci, brother-in-law of
the late Mr Gardini, Mr Sergio Cusani, a close associate of Mr Gardini with
links to the Socialist party, and Mr Giuseppe Berlini, who manages the
Ferruzzi family finances.
Mr Sama was charged with falsifying the 1992 Montedison accounts which
reported an unexplained L320bn (Pounds 134m) extra loss after shareholders
had approved the balance sheet.
Mr Gardini's death was discovered just two hours before a funeral service
began in a nearby church for Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of
the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. Mr Cagliari committed
suicide on Tuesday in his cell in Milan's San Vittore prison where he had
been held since March on corruption charges.
Mr Gardini and Mr Cagliari were rivals in the lengthy battle for control of
Enimont, the chemicals joint venture set up between Ferruzzi's Montedison
chemicals subsidiary and Eni in 1989.
Hailed as a long-overdue attempt to create a world-class Italian chemicals
group, management of the joint venture soon deteriorated into a lengthy war
of attrition between the two sides.
Magistrates investigating Enimont suspect that the events surrounding its
launch and its eventual dissolution in late 1990, when Eni bought out
Montedison's 40 per cent share, hide some of the worst excesses in Italy's
17-month-old political corruption scandal.
The Enimont affair may already have contributed to the suicide this year of
Mr Sergio Castellari, the top civil servant in the former Ministry of State
Shareholdings, closely involved in the formation and dissolution of the
joint venture. Mr Castel-lari's body was found on a hillside near his Rome
home.
Mr Gardini's death was almost certainly prompted by the return to Italy last
week of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, a former Montedison executive.
Mr Garofano, who went into hiding this year after being told by magistrates
he was under investigation over a L250m contribution to the Christian
Democrat party, was arrested in Geneva last week. He was apparently on his
way back to Italy to give himself up.
On Thursday night, an Italian news magazine released an extract of leaked
testimony from Mr Garofano, accusing Mr Gardini of various financial
irregularities at Montedison.
Mr Garofano reportedly confirmed suspicions that creating and dissolving
Enimont involved kickbacks to politicians and that Mr Gardini had authorised
property transactions to create a pool of L80bn-L100bn in off-balance-sheet
funds to pay kickbacks.
However, pressure had been mounting on Mr Gardini after his name was
formally added to those under investigation over Enimont earlier this year,
before Mr Garofano's return to Italy.

THE RUSSIAN parliament stepped up its challenge to President Boris Yeltsin
yesterday by voting to investigate one of his closest allies for alleged
corruption amid charges and countercharges of an impending putsch by
supporters of both sides.
The parliament voted to permit the procurator general to investigate Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's most
senior cabinet supporter, on charges that he misappropriated Dollars 14.5m
(Pounds 9.6m) of hard currency meant to buy baby food from a Swiss company.
Mr Shumeiko, in a television interview, dismissed the charges, saying they
were a purely 'political game'. His press secretary likened the move to
Stalin's liquidation of his opponents in the late 1930s.
The investigation follows another corruption probe into the affairs of Mr
Mikhail Poltaranin, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin and a man whose abrasive
insults to deputies made him unpopular.
During yesterday's session, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary
speaker, also produced one of his most vitriolic speeches against the
presidency.
At a press conference later, Mr Lev Ponomareyev, a leader of the Democratic
Russia group, urged Mr Yeltsin to cut short his two-week holiday because of
the 'pre-putsch situation' in the capital.
The fragile recovery in the Russian economy was also in jeopardy after
parliament passed a budget on Thursday night with a deficit of some
Rbs22,000bn (Pounds 14.6bn) or 25 per cent of gross national product,
compared with a government draft budget with a deficit of Rbs12,000bn.
Approval of the budget triggered a struggle that could threaten the delivery
of western financial assistance for further reforms.
Mr Khasbulatov said Russia was on the verge of economic collapse. He
commanded the parliament's presidium to remain in permanent session to be
ready for a 'sudden turnabout in the development of the political
situation'.

FT  24 JUL 93 / VW shares hit on spy probe links to Lopez: Speculation grows
over ex-GM executive's future

VOLKSWAGEN shares lost further ground yesterday as speculation grew that Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the motor group's controversial production
director, might be forced out.
The shares shed another 1 per cent of their value in Frankfurt as markets
reacted to Thursday's statement from prosecutors probing allegations of
industrial espionage against Mr Lopez.
The statement showed investigators had established a link between Mr Lopez
and a cache of confidential documents belonging to General Motors, his
former employer, found recently in a Wiesbaden house.
VW stocks closed DM3.2 lower at DM345, while other leading German motor
manufacturers gained and the Dax blue-chip index rose more than 17 points to
1830.83.
Mr Lopez would probably have to go sooner or later because suspicions about
his activities were harming confidence in the VW management, analysts said.
However, they agreed his loss would not seriously damage VW's recovery
prospects since restructuring measures were already well-established.
The company's comment on Thursday that there was no reason for Mr Lopez to
resign 'at present' was seen by one as a sign that the company was 'keeping
the back door open'.
Meanwhile, complaints from VW that the prosecutors' statement was
'one-sided' earned the company a brusque rebuff yesterday.
The prosecutors' Darmstadt office described as 'incomprehensible' charges of
bias on the grounds that VW had not been allowed to see four boxes of
documents found in a house recently vacated by two GM employees who followed
Mr Lopez to VW after he quit the US group in March.
The boxes contained details of a secret new car model, future sales
strategies, and, crucially, confidential information specifically requested
by Mr Lopez when he still worked in the US.
It also emerged that Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, yesterday met Mr
Gerhard Schroder, a senior member of the group's supervisory board.
Mr Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 per cent of VW,
has been a vociferous supporter of Mr Lopez and Mr Piech, defending them
against what he claims is a 'campaign' by a 'foreign' company to damage VW.
A state government spokesman said the two men would consider what
conclusions could be drawn from the week's events.

to a government draft budget with a deficit of Rbs12trln.
Approval of the budget triggered a struggle which could threaten the
delivery of Western financial assistance for further reforms.
Mr Khasbulatov said Russia was on the verge of economic collapse.
He commanded the parliament's praesidium to remain in permanent session to
be ready for a 'sudden turnabout in the development of the political
situation'.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, the first deputy finance minister, said the budget would
mean inflation surging up again to 25-30 per cent a month, from its present
level of around 17 per cent. He said he would ask Mr Yeltsin to use his
powers of veto on the parliamentary version.
The government's deficit would still be near the 5 per cent of GNP target
agreed with the Group of Seven industrialised countries - since assistance
provided by the G7, largely via the International Monetary Fund, would bring
down the deficit which had to be financed from domestic sources.
However, a team from the IMF returns to Washington this weekend sceptical of
the durability of the cuts suggested by the government - especially cuts to
wages and pensions, agricultural subsidies and payments at the military
industrial complex.
The first Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the G7's Dollars 3bn 'systemic
transformation facility' was disbursed last month - but a decision on the
second tranche will not be taken before mid September at the earliest.

FT  24 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: ShareLink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ShareLink's over-subscribed flotation suggests private investors are still
eager to invest in new issues, especially those of smaller companies. Since
the returns on cash have dwindled and small company shares have risen
steadily - the FT-SE SmallCap index has roundly outperformed the FT-SE 100
this year - such enthusiasm is understandable. That is doubly good news for
ShareLink, which profits from individuals' willingness to buy and sell
shares. The question for both the company and the new issues market is
whether retail interest will evaporate at the first hint of a bear market.
The number of small shareholders has already fallen by almost 2m from the
11m peak reached in 1991, thanks in large part to recession. With few big
privatisation issues in the pipeline, there seems little to tempt the
first-time buyers out of alternative investments. Tougher disclosure rules
for life insurance might just help the cause of equities. But without
further tax incentives from government, the high ideal of a share owning
democracy will remain no more than that.
That will not bother ShareLink, though, so long as the remaining core of
private shareholders are prepared to trade. Its figures point to a hardened
band of investors dealing more regularly, in greater size, and  - one hopes
 -aware of the risks.

FT  24 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome's victory in the first round of its fight to defend the patent of
AZT, its HIV treatment, came as a relief in a week of bad news for the
pharmaceuticals sector. Since the court case will almost certainly go to
appeal, though, it is too early to open the champagne. One can only hope
that management time spent defending AZT - first against medical studies
which questioned its efficiency and now in court - did not distract from
other tasks.
While AZT still holds promise, the engine for growth is more likely to come
from Zovirax, Wellcome's anti-viral drug. The broader question is whether
drugs companies will have to learn to live with litigation. Few compounds
unearthed in research survive to become marketable drugs. Boots' decision to
withdraw its heart drug Manoplax after Pounds 100m development underlines
the risks. If patent protection for the successful few is increasingly
called into question, drugs companies will be more risky investments.
Generic drugs producers in North America are certainly more willing to take
legal pot-shots, especially where the prize is great. Glaxo's defence next
month of the US patent of Zantac, its big-selling ulcer treatment, against a
generics company is a case in point.
The market is left with the tricky task of assessing the probability of
failure. Given the highly technical nature of the arguments, it is only
natural to err on the side of caution. The worry is that the threat of
litigation, like the threat of regulation, will not go away.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The short term economic logic for floating the franc is increasing as
inexorably as the pressure on the foreign exchange markets. The surge in
French bond and share prices yesterday reflects the growing conviction that
interest rates will have to come down by one means or another. Paris
financial markets assume either that the Bundesbank will buckle next
Thursday and reduce rates - a seemingly unlikely prospect - or that a franc
float will enable France to cut the cost of borrowing.
Yesterday's increase in money market rates suggests the authorities are
determined to tough it out. The government has mobilised a panoply of market
tactics as well as the heavy artillery of intervention while the franc is
still more than a centime above its D-Mark floor. At present, there is a
solid political consensus behind the policy. There are no psychological
deadlines, such as elections or referendums, to force a resolution of the
issue. Though battered, the franc could remain in the fight for some time to
come.
Such a policy, though, would be unsustainable if it meant market interest
rates remained high and fed through into bank lending rates. With
unemployment nudging 12 per cent, the clamour for some economic stimulus
would grow shriller. The privatisation programme, which was finally
unleashed this week, would also be jeopardised. Domestic investors,
unsettled by job insecurity, would be loath to switch out of safe money
market funds. Overseas investors would be nervous about buying shares
denominated in a vulnerable currency. Both would worry about the dismal
outlook for corporate earnings.

<TEXT>
After Maastricht, Christchurch. By the end of next week Mr John Major will
at least have these distractions out of the way, but his leadership will
hardly have been strengthened by his recourse to a confidence vote on the
social chapter and what promises to be a crushing by-election defeat. If the
equity market has remained relatively sanguine, it may be partly because Mr
Major's desire to restore his credibility reinforces his need for a
growth-oriented economic policy.
Recent statistics, including yesterday's second quarter GDP figures, show
the recovery remains in place. Presumably Mr Major's hope is that after the
summer holidays, the shame of this month's reverses will have been forgotten
and the economic recovery will lend fresh vigour to his leadership. The
chances are that he will respond to any setbacks by cutting interest rates,
a thought which should continue to underpin equities.
But a sterner test looms in the form of the interim results season. While
higher gilt prices leave the gilt/equity yield ratio comfortably over two,
equity valuations look somewhat stretched by a market prospective multiple
in excess of 14. Since worries over insider trading have made companies
particularly reluctant to steer City forecasts, it is unusually difficult to
anticipate the message from interim results. The chances are, though, that
it could be one of mild disappointment. The UK recovery may not yet show
through strongly in earnings and the downturn in continental Europe has
accelerated. It would help UK companies if the current ERM unrest led to
lower continental interest rates which would boost demand.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Pressures on House of Fraser shown in accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL pressures which caused the Fayed brothers to announce plans to
float the House of Fraser department store chain next year became clearer
yesterday.
House of Fraser Ltd's net assets fell from Pounds 811m to Pounds 755m in the
year to January 30, the annual report showed. The store-chain subsidiary
includes 59 House of Fraser stores, and Harrods, which is not to be floated.
Even allowing for some adjustments, these figures mean the Fayeds would have
risked breaking covenants to House of Fraser's bankers, which required an
increase in net worth of 5 per cent a year.
The accounts also confirm that House of Fraser Ltd provided borrowing
guarantees to the group holding company amounting to Pounds 668m, of which
Pounds 616m had been drawn down at April 30. House of Fraser group denied
this week that the Fayeds were under financial pressure and said a
refinancing was arranged in April.
The accounts show that House of Fraser Ltd's borrowings were refinanced at
variable rates linked to the London interbank offered rate, but the terms
are not disclosed. One indication of financial pressure is that Pounds 60m
must be repaid by April next year and Pounds 175m before April 1995.
The Fayeds believe the flotation of the stores will enable them to reduce
their debts and to retain Harrods.
Turnover at House of Fraser Ltd grew by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 1.06bn in the
year to January, which the company described as a 'strong performance in
difficult market conditions'.
It said operating profits increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 74.5m. An
exceptional charge of Pounds 68.7m meant House of Fraser Ltd made a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 7.8m, compared with a profit of Pounds 40.3m the previous
year. The charge mainly related to the waiving of inter-company loans.
The European Commission of Human Rights said yesterday the Fayeds had not
been denied justice by Britain, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. The brothers
claim they were denied redress in British courts against a damning
Department of Trade and Industry report in 1990 about their business
affairs.

US stock markets ended the week on a positive note yesterday as share prices
posted solid gains across the board on a burst of late buying, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 21.52 firmer at 3,546.74.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.59 at 447.10, while
the Amex composite finished 0.69 higher at 432.05, and the Nasdaq composite
up 4.72 at 700.24. Trading volume on the NYSE was 218m shares.
The equity markets ended a week of see-sawing share prices with further
fluctuations. Thursday's 30-point sell-off prompted some early buying,
lifting the Dow 20 points in the opening half an hour of trading.
Prices could not hold on to their gains, however, and continued selling in
the bond markets - where the benchmark 30-year government bond fell  23/32
to 105 11/32 , yielding 6.704 per cent - quickly unsettled equity investors,
forcing stocks to retreat to opening values.
Stocks subsequently staged their second rally of the day in the final hour
of trading as futures-related program buying in a thin market lifted prices
across the board.
Among individual stocks, Walt Disney climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 39 1/2
after the company's stock was upgraded by Prudential Securities and the
State of California announced it would fund the building of access roads to
Disney's new theme park.
Oil stocks were mostly firmer as more companies announced strong quarterly
earnings. Exxon, which reported second quarter profits of 98 cents a share,
up from 73 cents a share a year ago, climbed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 65 1/8 .
Chevron rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 87 5/8 , Texaco Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 62 1/4 , Mobil Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71, and Amoco Dollars 3/8 to
Dollars 53 1/8 . Sunbeam-Oster jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 18 3/8 after
the company announced plans to buy back 12.4m shares from a partnership
headed by former chief executive Mr Paul Kazarian.
Ralston-Purina dropped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 39 after brokers' downgraded
the stock following disappointing fiscal third quarter earnings of 59 cents
a share, down slightly from a year ago and well below expectations.
Telmex climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 49 1/8 in heavy trading on news of a
solid rise in first half earnings.
On the Nasdaq market, Amgen rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 after the
chairman said 1993 earnings would come in between Dollars 2.35 and Dollars
2.42 a share, up from Dollars 2.11 a share in 1992.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed lower in quiet, end-of-the-week trading.
According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell 8.31 points, or
0.22 per cent, to close at 3,830.19.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 353 to 313. Volume was 40.089m shares,
down from Thursday's 50.896m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars
417.6m from CDollars 517.9m.
The decline was the index's seventh in the past eight sessions, and brought
the index's decline for the week to about 72 points. Since closing just
below 4,000 points on July 2, the index has tumbled almost 170 points, or
more than 4 per cent.
Yesterday, seven of 14 sub-indexes finished lower, led by transport and
financial services, both off 1.0 per cent.

FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency turmoil moves Paris
closer to 2,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY speculation in France, massive corporate deals in Germany, and
personal tragedy in Italy moved bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS endured another day of drama in the money markets, which was reflected
in equities by a strong gain in the CAC-40 index, closing the day 29.32
higher at 1,995.04, up 1 per cent on the week.
Turnover was impressive at FFr3.7bn on the last day of the account as many
market participants continued to speculate that the franc would be devalued,
enabling interest rates to be cut.
The day's excitement began with the Bank of France raising its overnight
lending rate to 10 per cent from 7.75 per cent. The CAC index immediately
rallied and looked set to break the 2,000 level, but it shied just short to
record a day's best of 1,998.
Devaluation hopes lifted interest rate-sensitive sub-indices, with consumer
durables adding nearly 2 per cent. Among financials, SocGen gained FFr23 to
FFr628 for a week's advance of 7.5 per cent and Paribas FFr12.40 to
FFr439.90.
FRANKFURT concentrated on special situations as the DAX index closed 7.30
higher at 1,830.83, up 1 per cent on the week in turnover up from DM7.9bn to
DM9bn.
Viag climbed DM23.50, or 6.1 per cent to DM410 after the state of Bavaria
offered it the bulk of Bayernwerk, Germany's third largest electricity
generator, for 'at least' DM1bn and a Viag stake of 25.1 per cent. Analysts
said this was cheap at the price. Other utility groups like RWE, up DM3 at
DM413.50, and Veba, up DM4.40 at DM408.20, rose in sympathy and Viag itself
hit DM422 in the post-bourse, up 9.2 per cent on the day.
Deutsche Babcock also rose by 6.1 per cent, or DM11.20 to DM194.70 on a big
Swiss order and the company's perceived ability to benefit from federal
funds released to build and refurbish energy plants in eastern Germany. In
metals, Metallgesellschaft, recently volatile, climbed DM16, or 4.5 per cent
to DM385 on a similar rationale.
Allianz, the insurer, did not react to a DM2bn convertible or warrant bond
issue, and an equity rights issue which could raise around DM400m more. The
shares closed DM2 higher at DM2,288.
MILAN was shocked by the death of Mr Raul Gardini, former chairman of
Ferruzzi. But prices picked up later, although the mood remained uncertain,
and the Comit index finished 2.40 lower at 550.17, a 1.1 per cent decline on
the week.
'The news about Mr Gardini came as a complete surprise,' said Mr Guiseppe
Bonini of Intersim in Milan. 'People are wondering what can have been behind
it and they are becoming really worried about what is going on.'
Ferruzzi shares, which lost 8 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the
news, finished L23.5 or 5.5 per cent down at L406.5. Montedison, down 4 per
cent in early business, edged L1.5 higher to L703.5 in heavy volume of
almost 14m shares.
ZURICH picked up from a quiet start with the arrival of renewed foreign
demand and the SMI index rose 10.0 to 2,350.5, for a weekly fall of 1.9 per
cent.
Nestle, under pressure earlier in the week, gave up most of an early SFr13
rise to finish SFr1 ahead at SFr1,026 on first-half results in line with all
but the most optimistic expectations. Sulzer fell SFr17 or 2.3 per cent to
SFr713 in response to a forecast of unchanged profits for 1993.
AMSTERDAM showed a modest gain, the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.4 to 118.0,
unchanged on the week. KLM, which launched a Fl 250m commercial paper
programme, rose 30 cents to Fl 334.10 for a week's gain of 2.4 per cent.
Royal Dutch added Fl 1.60 to Fl 178.40.
MADRID's turnover rose again, with an estimate of Pta20bn against Pta18.4bn
as the general index rose 1.41 to 260.40 on interest rate speculation, up
0.9 per cent on the week.

FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sharp rise in yen
unsettles Nikkei average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the yen, reports of a spreading bribery scandal, and further
uncertainty over the shape of the next government discouraged investors, and
the Nikkei average lost 1.9 per cent on arbitrage-linked selling amid low
trading volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index fell 381.24 to 19,734.57, a loss on the week of 2.9 per
cent. The index opened at 20,049.80, but tumbled below the 20,000 level
during the morning session in tandem with the futures market. Arbitrage
unwinding depressed the index to a day's low of 19,733.77 just before the
close.
Volume fell to 200m shares against 236m. Declines overwhelmed advances by
900 to 99, with 141 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks lost 24.96 to 1,609.33 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
1.24 to 1,224.46.
A sharp rise in the yen depressed investors, with the dollar trading below
the Y107 level for the first time since July 8, and finally closing at
Y106.55, down Y1.73.
Reports that a provincial governor was likely to be implicated in the
country's bribery scandal involving Hazama, the construction company, also
hurt investor sentiment. A move by opposition parties, including the
splinter groups from the Liberal Democratic Party, to form a coalition,
added to the negative impact on prices.
Construction companies were sold on fears of the bribery scandal spreading
further to other contractors and local governments. Hazama fell Y10 to Y435
and Obayashi lost Y30 to Y611.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 309.71 to 21,835.55 in volume of 13.8m
shares.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING emerged in some of the Pacific Rim markets after their
strength in recent days.
TAIWAN surged 2.4 per cent in active trade on low short-term interest rates,
news that the central bank had agreed to ease curbs on foreign investment
and after small deposit rate cuts by local banks.
The weighted index opened higher and late buying pushed it up more than 100
points at one stage. It closed 95.43 ahead at 4,027.58, or 2.9 per cent
higher on the week, in turnover that rose to TDollars 21.3bn from Thursday's
TDollars 12.56bn.
All sectors rose but the Taiwan dollar's fall against the US currency caused
buying to focus on export-related shares, especially electronics.
MANILA set a third consecutive record close although profit-taking began to
take a toll after the week's strong rally. The composite index rose 8.83 to
1,715.78, up 6.2 per cent on the week.
AUSTRALIA recovered early losses and the All Ordinaries index finished 4.2
higher at 1,806.8, or 0.4 per cent higher on the week. The market found
support in strong offshore and local buying and renewed hope of an early
interest rate cut.
NEW ZEALAND's four-day rally ran out of steam and profits were taken amid
concern about the strength of the local currency. The NZSE-40 index closed
down 9.27 at 1,720.07.
SEOUL ended lower in weak trading, depressed by worsening labour disputes at
Hyundai subsidiaries and tight liquidity. The composite index shed 4.75 at
741.81, a 2.4 per cent weekly decline.
HONG KONG again saw selling by foreign institutions, worried about the
Chinese economy, but the Hang Seng index, which was more than 50 points
lower at one stage, recovered much of the loss to finish 9.69 easier at
6,750.33 or 2.5 per cent down on the week.
SINGAPORE saw late buying of speculative Malaysian shares and the Straits
Times industrial index added 4.67 at 1,823.08 for a 2.6 per cent rise on the
week.
BOMBAY was officially open, but no deals took place as a result of a
brokers' protest against the suspension of 11 Ahmedabad colleagues for not
paying registration fees.

FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign institutions break Austrian
bear market - Lower interest rates and a favourable tax reform package have
brought the buyers in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's slump-battered bankers still cannot quite believe their eyes. But
when they study their charts, it looks more and more as if the bearish
sentiment that has dominated the Vienna stock market for three years has
finally evaporated.
Since the beginning of this year, the ATX index of the 19 continually traded
shares on the Vienna Borse has gained over 25 per cent, nearly half of it in
a spurt this month.
At 936.90, up another 13.65 yesterday for a 6.7 per cent gain on the week,
the ATX is still a long way from its all time peak above 1,700 in March
1990, but this upturn has been greater and more sustained than any of the
four previous advances that turned into bull traps.
Analysts say that the latest surge has been driven mainly by foreign
institutional investors, a sign that the bad days are truly over. 'For the
first time, we are seeing new money coming in real volume,' says Mr Lukas
Stipkovich, an analyst at GiroCredit in Vienna.
Also, for the first time in a long while, analysts feel there are a number
of solid reasons for buying Austrian equities.
The declining interest rate trend has gathered pace in recent months,
enabling the yield curve to straighten out and signalling an impending turn
in the economic cycle. If the timing of that turnround still seems
uncertain, to say the least, an unexpectedly favourable tax reform package
announced last month has given an immediate fillip to many shares.
Also, some analysts are beginning to talk again about the promise of central
and eastern Europe, and the process of institutional reforms to improve
transparency and stamp out insider offences is progressing well.
However, the Austrian market is still not for the faint hearted. Only a few
shares can be traded easily, so prices tend to be volatile. The flow of
price sensitive information is uneven. And, as Mr Marko Musulin, director of
securities at Creditanstalt points out, even at today's prices the market as
a whole, on a prospective price earnings ratio of about 30, is not cheap.
Until the last few weeks, most of the action had been concentrated on only
three shares, Creditanstalt preferred and the energy utilities, Verbund and
EVN.
Expectations that declining interest rates would enable Creditanstalt to
bounce back quickly after a terrible 1992 have propelled the preferred
shares from a low of Sch409 at the beginning of the year to Sch663
yesterday, a 62 per cent rise.
Verbund and EVN stood out among the companies gaining most from tax reforms
announced by the government last month.
The reforms, which are to be implemented at the beginning of next year, will
eliminate five profit-based taxes, raise the main corporate tax from 30 per
cent to 34 per cent and simplify several other taxes.
On average, the overall level of profit-based taxes will go down by 10 per
cent, which is good news for all shares, but inevitably there are
exceptional winners and losers. The elimination of a property tax is
especially helpful for the banks and utilities, and the removal of the trade
tax, which penalises borrowing, provides a further boost to utility stocks.
Bank Austria Investment Bank has estimated that the reform will push up
EVN's earnings by 15 per cent next year. EVN shares have jumped from Sch840,
just before the reform was announced on June 8, to a year's high of Sch980
this week.
In the wake of the tax reform announcement, the market attracted increasing
attention from overseas institutional investors, many of whom have since
boosted their weighting for Austrian equities.
Thus, for the moment, the market is showing signs of being liquidity driven.
Analysts believe there is still something to go for in the market leaders,
but are now widening their range of interest. GiroCredit thinks Bank
Austria, which has not performed as well as Creditanstalt, could move if
interim profits, to be reported next Thursday, reflect the expected
recovery.
Sentiment about OMV, the big integrated oil and chemicals group, is mixed
following a series of disappointments last year. The heavily traded share
has moved up with the market this month, but Mr Robin Horne of ICE
Securities in London suspects that its refinery margins are still being
squeezed by eastern European competitors, so there is no hurry to buy.
Special situations, such as the construction groups Bau Holding and Maculan
with big exposure in eastern Europe, have been popular, and investors are
even turning to cyclical stocks. Radex, a maker of refractory bricks, has
jumped Sch40 in the past week to Sch423. Lenzing, a fibres group, has soared
from Sch691 to Sch830 over the same period.
The danger, as Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson in London, points out,
is that all this is happening too quickly and too early.
'This liquidity-driven market may well continue, but in three months, many
people may start to wonder where the economic recovery is,' Mr Thomson says.
Also, the liquidity could start being soaked up by new issues. Many
companies have held back from raising new equity in the past two years
because of depressed prices.
At that point, he suspects international investors would move into other
markets. 'I am not looking for a big setback, but I think things will
drift.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY morning jitters in stock index futures gave way to more positive trade
as optimism grew that the government would survive the Commons vote of
confidence, Christine Buckley writes.
The nervousness which had held back the September contract on the FT-SE 100
began to subside as hopes firmed that the spectre of Maastricht would soon
be exorcised. Investors returned and significant buying was seen. The
contract traded in one of its widest ranges of recent sessions and rose well
above low levels prevalent over the past few days.
It opened at 2,812 and dipped to 2,809 before embarking on an upward course.
It hit its high of the day of 2,846 at about 3pm when profit-taking set in
to take off the shine. The closing rate was 2,834 and volume 9,108
contracts. September finished the week 2 points ahead of its fair value
premium to cash.
In traded options the most activity in stocks was seen in Prudential as
sellers acted on fresh regulatory plans. It traded 2,985 lots.

FT  24 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firm as political tensions
ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government's success in winning a vote of confidence in the House of
Commons was no surprise for a London stock market which, after recovering
from an initial, nervous, mark-down in share prices, was in steadier form
yesterday.
While political uncertainty is expected to remain an unsettling investment
factor, the stock market hopes that the impending parliamentary recess will
reduce such pressures.
Much of the session was spent mulling over Thursday night's dramatic
parliamentary developments and awaiting the outcome of yesterday's vote.
With sterling easier, export worries slackened.
Government bonds steadied following the result of the confidence debate,
closing with minor losses as growth of 0.5 per cent in second quarter gross
domestic product suggested that the UK economy was gathering momentum.
Long-dated bonds shed about  1/4 of a point while near-dates, closely linked
to interest rate expectations, closed un-changed. Index-linked gilts, the
prime anti-inflation hedge, shaded lower.
Early deals saw the FT-SE Index down to 2,801.2, a fall of nearly 19 points
as marketmakers took avoiding action while waiting for the political fog to
clear. There was little selling, however, and the 2,800 area again proved a
secure base. Helped by favourable comment from market strategists, share
prices quickly turned higher.
At best, the Footsie was a net 11.9 up before settling back to await the
news from Westminster. Few traders appeared willing to act decisively ahead
of the weekend, and the final reading of 2,827.7 showed the FT-SE Index 7.6
ahead.
The first week of the equity account has seen the Footsie ease by 5.3 as the
Maastricht debate in the UK overshadowed an already uncertain stock market.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 2.4 to 3,202.9 yesterday and has shed 14.6
over the week.
Seaq volume slipped to 531.6m shares from 582.4m on Thursday when retail
business was worth Pounds 1.29bn.
At Nomura Securities, Mr Nick Knight suggested that political issues may be
irrelevant and that current market levels could be the last chance to 'get
on board' at around Footsie 2,800. But Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull
disagreed, warning that political, risk will remain 'an important brake' on
equities in the short term.

<TEXT>
Opportunities in the German market pepped up the fortunes of RMC after
NatWest Securities recommended it as being in a prime position to take
advantage of building developments there. Pushing the stock as a buy,
NatWest said that although the German picture can be mixed, RMC is well
poised for good results, especially as it has the lion's share of the Berlin
market.
The share price rose 8 to 776p although the market was relatively thin.
Redland also saw an improvement in its fortunes along similar lines and it
advanced 6 to 477p.
Shares in chemicals group ICI added 6 to 651p, ahead of its first post
merger results on Thursday. Hoare Govett, the broker, is predicting interim
profits of Pounds 135m, and an interim dividend of 10.5p. It said the
results 'are likely to reflect a patchy six months trading'. Zeneca,
demerged from ICI at the begining of June, also reports on Thursday. The
shares gained 14 to 613p, ahead of the results in trade of 4.9m.
The favourable figures announced earlier this week by SmithKline Beecham
continued to boost the stock and the shares gained another 10 to 435p.
Profit-taking left Wellcome trailing 3 at 638p.
Property stocks boasted a couple of success stories. Hammerson Ord added 10
to 355p while the 'A' shares went up 10 to 324p after the Pounds 87m sale of
Woolgate House, one of its City office properties. Asda Properties advanced
2 to 90p after announcing a 97.2 per cent take-up of its recent rights
issue.
Shaftesbury fell back 2 to 96 on news that it aimed to raise Pounds 20.8m to
fund expansion via a placing and open offer with new shares priced at 88p.
A standstill agreement with its bankers gave Hartstone, the leather and
hosiery company, a breathing space that pleased the market. Its share price
moved ahead 7 to 56p. It was the successful culmination of banking
negotiations that the company had worked very hard on, said one industry
specialist.
Power companies staged a recovery. National Power went ahead 3 to 354p and
PowerGen put on 5 to 377p.
Among transport stocks, recent favourable figures from US airlines brought
US investors to British Airways. The shares gained 6 to 326p, with some 4.7m
shares having been dealt by the close.
Bid-speculation continued to surround container transport group Tiphook. The
shares added a further 6 to 250p, as some US investors used the renewed
strength of the share price to bale out of the stock.
Hints from Taiwan that the regional jets joint venture with British
Aerospace would be signed shortly boosted trading, sending the shares 8
forward to 404p.
Bargain hunters in Rolls-Royce helped the shares bounce 2 1/2 to 140p.
British Steel, a penny better at 108p, was the subject of a two-way pull
which brought volume of 24m.
A profits warning from Computer services group Rolfe &amp; Nolan sent the shares
falling 28 to 255p.
Chemicals stocks were quiet all day. Laporte, oversold over the last couple
of weeks while waiting for market analysts to assess the results, recovered
7p to 593p.
Yorkshire Chemicals, which started at 330p against 350p the previous night,
managed to climb back to 345p. Jeremy Chantry with Kleinwort Benson said the
movement was more technical than fundamental, pointing to turnover of only
63,000 shares.
Waste Management continued the decline prompted by the announcement on
Monday of a 15 per cent earnings increase in the first half of the year,
which disappointed market expectations. The shares slid 12p to 555p
yesterday.
In the textile sector, Parkland 'A' shed 9p to 141p while Courtauld Textile
closed up 3p at 537p. De La Rue did well in the printing sector, gaining 10p
to 649p.
BAT Industries hit 452p in the afternoon session but fell back to close up 5
to 449p.

THE ORDER from the Treasury to securities regulators to draft rules
requiring life insurance agents to disclose more about their products took
the market by surprise and sent shares in the sector sharply downwards.
Dealers said the regulatory changes were 'more wide ranging than anybody had
anticipated' and were uncertain about how the life companies will cope with
them.
Among the big life companies, the biggest fall was recorded in Legal &amp;
General where the shares were down 33 at the day's worst before steadying to
close a net 31 off at 470p after hefty trading of 7.5m.
Also hit was Prudential Corporation, in which hectic trading brought heavy
volume of 20m as the shares fell 22 to 310p. Sentiment in Prudential was
already poor following the release of disappointing new business figures on
Thursday.
Goldman Sachs took both stocks off its buy list, downgrading them to a
'hold'. Mr Stephen Dias at the US investment bank said the new regulations
will cause uncertainty and put the whole sector under a cloud for some time.
But he predicted that stronger companies such as the Prudential would emerge
yet stronger in a slimmed-down life market. NatWest Securities urged
investors to buy Prudential saying that it offers the greatest upside on the
'orphan asset issue'.
The day's other casualties in the sector included Refuge Group which gave up
53 to 950p, United Friendly 'B' down 25 at 638p, and Lloyds Abbey which run
back 28 to 412p.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Rates tense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France's decision to increase its emergency lending rate
yesterday sent further tremors through European money markets, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
French cash rates rose sharply after the Bank of France's raised interest
rates in the morning. They continued to face upward pressure as the currency
drama continued, with investors striving to cover short franc positions. One
month rates rose to 10.5 per cent on the bid side, up nearly 250 basis
points, while three month rates ended the week nearly 100 basis points
higher than Thursday's close, at around 8.90 per cent on the bid side.
Trading in French futures initially painted a rather different picture,
because some thought that the crisis meant lower French interest rates by
the autumn, whatever happened to the franc in the meantime. The September
Pibor contract rose over 25 basis points during the morning, but the
confusion was such that it retreated rapidly in the afternoon, closing 5
basis points down at around 92.62.
'The fact that at one point we had the September Pibor, cash rates and the
French stock market all going up at the same time shows just how uncertain
the situation is,' commented Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland
Global Markets in London.
In German money markets, events were dictated early on by the Bundesbank's
decision to issue three-day treasury bills at a rate of 7 per cent. The
issue was intended to remove some of the excess liquidity caused by the last
few day's interventions, which otherwise might have sent call money rates
down to dangerously near the 6.75 per cent official intervention rate.
The immediate result was a fall in German call money rates to around 7.02
per cent, compared with Thursday's level of 7.15 per cent. But observers
pointed out that by leaving the treasury bill rate at 7 per cent, the German
central bank had conspicuously failed to signal a cut in official interest
rates at Thursday's council meeting.
'In the past', said Julian Callow of Kleinwort Benson, 'the Bundesbank has
cut the three-day treasury bill rate to the discount rate, or even lower,
prior to reducing the discount rate itself. The fact that it chose not to do
so suggests to the market that it does not want to cut rates.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: French bid to scare speculators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Bank of France took the initiative in the defence of the franc yesterday
when it raised the French 24 hour lending rate and joined the Bundesbank in
verbal and monetary support of the French currency, writes Stephanie
Flanders.
The French authorities announced the 2.25 per cent rate hike early in the
day, raising the official overnight rate to 10 per cent from the previous
level of 7.75 per cent. This was followed by a day of frequent and open
purchases of the franc by both the French and German central banks.
By the end of trading, a concerted official effort to keep the franc from
falling below Ffr3.418 against the D-Mark appeared to have worked. In
London, the French currency closed at Ffr3.416, a little stronger than
Thursday's close of Ffr3.419, but still little more than a centime above its
ERM floor of Ffr3.4305.
On balance, few in the market thought that there would be a realignment of
the ERM over the weekend, despite rumours of emergency EC monetary committee
sessions which were quickly denied. For many, the fact that the Bank of
France did not feel able to raise any other official rates showed that the
underlying cause of the crisis, too high real interest rates, remained.
'The market's mood is still very negative towards the ERM,' said Neil
MacKinnon of Citibank in London. 'The interest rate hikes that we've seen
this week from a number of countries are generally judged to be counter
productive and unsustainable against a background of deteriorating economic
conditions.'
Other recently embattled ERM currencies saw a similar easing of pressure.
The Spanish peseta closed at Pta79.63, a little up on Thursday's Pta79.84,
and the Portuguese escudo similarly held its own, closing at Esc99.85
against the D-Mark compared with the previous day's Esc100.25.
Less fortunate was the Danish krone, which lurched down towards its ERM
floor once again, closing at around Dkr3.8942 against the German currency
compared with a previous finish of Dkr3.8805. By the end of the week's
trading, the Danish currency had once again taken the French franc's place
at the bottom of the ERM currency grid, just above its floor rate against
the D-Mark of Dkr3.9016.
Meanwhile the yen strengthened, partly as a result of the European tensions.
The Japanese currency rose sharply across the board for much of the day, but
later retreated. It closed at Y159.75 against the pound, up from the
previous Y161.00, and nearly half a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at
Y62.11.

MARRIOTT Corporation, the lodging and food services group, won shareholder
approval at yesterday's annual meeting for its controversial proposal to
split the company into two.
It wants to demerge its main operating interests - the lodging business and
food services operations, to be known as Marriott International - from its
property assets and the bulk of the group's debts, which will be grouped in
a business to be known as Host Marriott.
Just before yesterday's meeting Marriott also announced it had reached a
settlement with a group which had opposed the plan: preferred shareholders
who argued the split would hurt them financially.
The settlement involves the dissidents converting their preferred stock into
common stock before the demerger goes ahead, and a payment to them which the
company described as 'immaterial'.
The company has already seen off a bondholder revolt by agreeing to swap
Dollars 1.525bn of existing bonds for new high- yielding debt.

<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals-based group, is to merge most of its
environmental service businesses into a new subsidiary with an annual
turnover of DM3.6bn (Dollars 2.09bn), based on 1991-92 sales, and around
12,000 employees.
The new company, Metallgesellschaft Umwelt (MGU),will be run by board member
Mr Karlheinz Arras and include six specialist operating units.
These will be involved in waste processing; dumping; recycling and burning;
transport; water and sewerage services; and site clearance and cleaning. The
last unit covers a growing business in highly-polluted industrial areas of
eastern Germany and the former communist bloc.
The bundling process, which excludes the plant construction division and the
Lurgi engineering services business, is part of group strategy which focuses
on high-margin and growing businesses.
Metallgesellschaft's environmental divisions occupy important niches. Two
units to be merged into MGU's new metals recycling division, for example,
will represent Europe's biggest processor of exhausted dry and wet-cell
batteries.

buy OTB

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUOCCO Group, which owns Dao Heng Bank, yesterday emerged as the victor in
the contest to acquire Overseas Trust Bank (OTB), which has been under Hong
Kong government administration since 1985.
Analysts in Hong Kong expect the sale price to be in the vicinity of
HKDollars 4bn (USDollars 516m).
Mr Michael Cartland, the colony's secretary for financial services, said
Guocco had agreed to pay HKDollars 420m in excess of the OTB's net assets,
which are being assessed.
In the year to June 1992 OTB made net profit of HKDollars 353m, up 70 per
cent on the HKDollars 210m to the end of June 1991.
Hong Kong's banking industry is among the most profitable in the world.
Among the many barriers to entry, the high cost of land is the main one
which makes expansion of a retail banking network extremely expensive.
With the acquisition of OTB, Dao Heng's branch network in the colony will
double. It will leave Guocco's enlarged banking group ranking third in terms
of branches and capital base among locally-incorporated banks, and fifth in
terms of total assets.
Mr Werner Makowski, managing director of Guocco, described the acquisition
as 'a wonderful deal'. The acquisition would substantially increase the
banking group's capitalisation and give it a solid foundation for expansion,
he said.
Guocco will finance the acquisition from internal resources and external
loan finance. Mr Makowski said Guocco's aimed to seek a separate listing for
its banking interests, probably later this year.
OTB was rescued by the HK government in 1985 after investigators discovered
widespread fraud and false loans totalling USDollars 70m. During its
administration, the government subscribed to about HKDollars 2bn in
additional capital to keep the bank solvent.
Since 1988, OTB has traded profitably at an operational level, but at the
end of June last year its accumulated losses are thought to have been about
HKDollars 2bn.
Guocco has undertaken to maintain OTB as a separate bank for two years,
after which it is free to merge it with Dao Heng.

FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Death of a legendary Wall St
partnership - Joseph Perella's departure from the deal-maker he co-founded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE departure on Thursday of Mr Joseph Perella, co-founder of Wasserstein
Perella, to 'seek new challenges', breaks up a legendary Wall Street
partnership.
Suddenly, for the firm that created such seminal 1980s deals as the creation
of Time Warner and Philip Morris' takeover of Kraft, the future looks far
from settled.
Perella, a 51-year-old accountant, has always portrayed a low-key image,
both inside and outside the firm. It was Bruce Wasserstein, the former
lawyer and renowned deal-maker, who stole the limelight. The two had worked
together for 16 years, turning First Boston in to the top US mergers and
acquisitions adviser before leaving to set up on their own five years ago.
Perella's departure will further shake up what has become a seriously
weakened advisory business.
The failure of a number of the highly-leveraged deals it helped put
together, such as the Campeau department store chain, has undermined the
firm's reputation in a shrunken market.
To some, 'Wasserella' has become synonymous with all the worst excesses of
the takeover boom. During the first half of this year, the firm ranked a
lowly 35th in the league table of advisers to US M&amp;A transactions, with just
seven transactions valued at Dollars 270m to its credit, according to
Securities Data. This is a far cry from its 1989 heyday as the third-ranked
adviser in the biggest ever US takeover boom.
Perella's split with Wasserstein has been in the air for some time,
according to people close to the firm. One former top executive who recently
left says: 'Personally, they were always very close. Joe was extremely
effective at winning business; Bruce was good at doing deals. But
particularly in the last couple of years, when things started to go awry,
there have been a lot of arguments.'
He says Perella has grown increasingly angry at the adverse publicity the
firm has attracted, which he blames on Wasserstein. He is given to frequent
outbursts of temper, much of it directed at his long-standing partner.
As the firm's chairman, he also had to deal with growing pressures created
by the decline in advisory work and growth of other businesses.
This has been particularly true of the trading of junk (sub-investment
grade) bonds, a business which first boomed and collapsed with the leveraged
buy-out boom of the late 1980s, but which has made a come-back on Wall
Street. According to one inside estimate, Grantchester, the firm's junk bond
trading arm headed by William Begley, has made operating profits of between
Dollars 20m and Dollars 25m a year in the last two years.
'As always happens on Wall Street, as Begley's group did better, they began
strutting around,' says the former executive. The demands for more power and
a larger share of the firm's profits are reported to have angered Perella.
The management shake-up following Perella's departure could help to ease
these tensions. Begley was named deputy chairman yesterday, while two other
top executives - Charles Ward and Gary Parr - were appointed co-presidents.
Wasserstein himself has become chairman.
However, Perella's departure will intensify pressure on the firm's M&amp;A
business. While Wasserstein built up an unrivalled reputation in the late
1980s for his robust deal-making, Perella was the relationship banker,
bringing in new business and maintaining links with big US companies and,
increasingly, those abroad.
James Van Meter, chief financial officer of Georgia-Pacific, the US's
biggest paper group and among Wasserstein Perella biggest customers, said:
'There is absolutely no way an organisation of which Joe Perella is a part
can help but be substantially weakened by his departure - he is a premier
banker.'
The departure also raises questions about the firm's ownership. The two
founding partners are understood to have held a majority of the shares
before a Dollars 100m investment by Nomura, which took their stake down to
close to 40 per cent. Of this, Wasserstein is understood to hold the largest
portion, with Perella's interest between 15 and 20 per cent.
A spokesman for Wasserstein Perella says the 20 per cent stake held by
Nomura is locked in by agreement for at least another three years. Nomura,
though, says the original five-year agreement runs out next month, and that
any extension beyond that has only been a 'gentleman's agreement'. With
questions hanging over two big shareholdings, the future for a former Wall
Street legend remains far from clear.

CATERPILLAR, the world's biggest construction equipment maker, yesterday
unveiled better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, thanks to growth in
new business, record revenues and an improving economy.
In the three months to June 30, it earned Dollars 67m, or 66 cents a share.
A year earlier, the US recession and a bitter employee strike pushed the
company into the red with a loss of Dollars 64m, or 63 cents.
Sales and revenues rose 12 per cent to Dollars 2.91bn in the latest quarter
from Dollars 2.6bn, largely due to a 24 per cent rise in US sales, to
Dollars 1.44bn. Outside the US, sales edged 1 per cent higher to Dollars
1.37bn from Dollars 1.35bn.
Physical sales volume of machinery and engines rose 7 per cent. Higher
prices helped lift sales by 12 per cent, to Dollars 2.81bn, while pre-tax
profits climbed to Dollars 74m, against a loss of Dollars 100m a year
earlier.
The company said its overall earnings projections for the rest of the year
had not changed significantly. However it warned the outlook for Europe
continued to deteriorate in the second quarter. Caterpillar hopes higher US
sales will offset the shortfall.
Caterpillar's labour conditions remain uncertain. Although the United Auto
Workers' strike ended last April, the company has not resumed negotiations
with the union and a new contract has yet to be signed.
The company said its results would depend on the strength of the recovery in
the US, the severity of recession in Europe, and economic and political
conditions in Brazil, where the company has large operations.
Caterpillar's first-half profits were Dollars 101m, or Dollars 1, against a
restated loss of Dollars 221m a year earlier. Sales and revenues rose 17 per
cent to Dollars 5.6bn.

NORWAY'S Bank Insurance Fund is to convert NKr3.5bn (Dollars 479.5m) in
preference capital in Den norske Bank, the country's biggest bank, to 350m
shares.
DnB's shares closed down sharply on the Oslo bourse following yesterday's
unexpected news. The bank's ordinary A shares shed NKr2.90 to NKr14.60 and
non-voting 'free' shares plunged NKr4 to NKr19.
Analysts said the shares could come under heavy pressure next week, at least
until the BIF clarifies when it plans to exercise the option for the
conversion and stipulates how many shares it will retain and how many it
intends to sell.
DnB said its current share capital was NKr2.37bn, of which the BIF holds 69
per cent. The remaining shares are spread among 6,000 private shareholders.
Last autumn the finance ministry announced the government intended to
re-privatise Christiania Bank (CBK), the second biggest bank, and indicated
it would dispose of a portion of its DnB stake.
However, analysts had not expected to see the move until next year.

FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bavaria to sell its Bayernwerk
stake to Viag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German state of Bavaria is selling its majority stake in Bayernwerk, the
country's third-largest utility, to Viag, the energy-based conglomerate.
The Bavarian government is swapping its 58.3 per cent stake in Bayernwerk
for a 25 per cent stake in Viag, in addition to DM1bn (Dollars 588m). The
deal will mean Viag will move its headquarters from Bonn to Munich, and be
able to expand its energy base.
The share exchange will lead to the merger of two companies which already
have close ties. The merged group will have an annual turnover of more than
DM40bn, and 100,000 employees.
The deal is seen as a two-pronged strategy by the Bavarian government to
attract larger companies to the state and speed up privatisation.
Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister, denied he was selling off the
'family silver'. The government maintains it is determined to boost, as well
as diversify, the state's industrial base, partly through privatisation.
The deal, which will be sealed later this year at an extraordinary
shareholders meeting of Viag, lifted Viag's shares DM6 to DM392.50.
The merger will also give Bayernwerk, released from state control, greater
freedom in the capital and stock markets, as well as opportunities to
diverse and invest outside Germany.
It could also place the new company in a stronger position to compete abroad
with RWE Energie, the German market leader, and the Veba unit
PreussenElektra, the runner-up.
Mr Max Streibl, former prime minister of Bavaria, had resisted moves to
relinquish control over Bayernwerk or to introduce privatisation on broad
scale.
Viag and Bayernwerk already have a close relationship. Before the merger,
Viag owned 39 per cent of Bayernwerk, and the latter held a 24.9 per cent
stake in Viag. In addition, Mr Jochen Holzer is chairman of the supervisory
board of Viag, and chairman of Bayernwerk.

GROUPE Bull, the state-owned french computer manufacturer, said yesterday it
was close to completing an agreement with NEC of Japan on collaboration in
mainframe computers.
The agreement, expected to be announced in September, will represent a
strengthening of ties between the two groups. NEC owns 4.3 per cent of the
loss-making French computer group, and the two have had a technological
partnership for more than 10 years.
An accord on mainframe computers would also be a further step in Bull's
strategy of extending alliances with other international manufacturers.
This strategy is aimed at developing models and expanding its presence in
international markets. Last month, Bull signed an agreement with Packard
Bell of the US for the development and manufacture of personal computers.
The French computer company is in talks with its government on a strategy to
reduce its losses. Last year, Bull suffered losses of FFr4.7bn (Dollars
800m).
Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has said the state cannot continue
to fund the deficit.

At issue is CSM's use of non-convertible depositary receipts, a type of

FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gucci chief in fight to retain
50% shareholding - Court battle for control of luxury goods maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE battle for control of luxury goods maker Gucci is being launched in
the US courts and threatens to be as bloody as the family rivalries which
rocked the Italian fashion house for more than a decade.
Investcorp, the international investment bank based in Bahrain which owns 50
per cent of Gucci, is seeking to unseat the chairman and grandson of the
founder and win control of his 50 per cent stake through two court actions
begun in New York this week.
The bank claims that several operating subsidiaries of what was once one of
Italy's greatest fashion houses are 'in or near insolvency' due to the
conduct of Mr Maurizio Gucci.
Investcorp has won a temporary order freezing his 50 per cent stake for 10
days. The action was taken following Investcorp's claims that he was seeking
to put his holding out of the reach of the bank, which has rights of first
refusal over the shares.
Maurizio is the last remaining Gucci on the board and was the apparent
victor in a fight for control of the 70-year-old company which set fathers,
sons, brothers and cousins against one another in the 1980s.
Investcorp is also seeking to remove Mr Gucci through an arbitration
procedure alleging several violations of the shareholder agreement drawn up
in 1991, when Investcorp took its 47.8 per cent stake to 50 per cent.
Mr Gucci is alleged to have pledged shares to secure debts and borrowed
Dollars 800,000 (Pounds 533,000) from Gucci America without Investcorp's
knowledge.
Furthermore, Investcorp also alleges that in 1991 Mr Gucci planned to
auction 90 per cent of his stake to pay off a judgment against him.
Questioned on how he managed to repay the debt at the eleventh hour, without
selling his shares, Investcorp claims Mr Gucci said he had found the money
under the floorboards of his house after 'being visited in a dream by the
ghost of his father'.
A spokesman for Investcorp said the decision to resolve the dispute in court
followed two years of discussions with Mr Gucci over managing the company.
It is believed the bank has offered Mr Gucci the titular chairmanship as
long as it controls day-to-day running of the company. The bank is believed
to have identified a number of possible replacements for Mr Gucci.
Spokesmen for Mr Gucci in Milan dismissed the initiative. The arbitration
procedure 'can have no influence on the Gucci group shares, which are and
will remain Maurizio Gucci's', and the company would continue to be run
normally, they said.
Any conduct 'injurious' to the agreement between Mr Gucci and Investcorp 'is
solely attributable to the Arab shareholders', according to Gucci. As for
the criticisms of the group's management, these reflect a 'distorted reading
of the facts and strategies', which emerges in the 'divergent judgments
about the real situation of the Gucci group'.
The bank, which has come to prominence by purchasing, developing and selling
on western luxury goods companies such as Tiffany, Chaumet and most recently
Saks Fifth Avenue, claims Gucci has been deprived of vital funding.
Investcorp alleges that attempts to inject capital of between Dollars 50m
and Dollars 100m, in return for a controlling stake in Gucci, have been
rejected by Maurizio.
Gucci has had a troubled time since the bitter family dispute which
distracted managers' attention from running the business was finally
resolved in 1990.
Mr Gucci has tried to rationalise the group's products and geographical
expansion, both of which had grown out of hand in the booming 1980s.
The aim has been to return Gucci to its roots as a producer of up-market
accessories, notably shoes and bags, and clothing, rather than attach its
name to any articles which might sell.
The number of authorised sales outlets has also been pared, with a sharp
reduction in stores which are not deemed to be sufficiently upmarket or
suitably located to reflect the Gucci name. In addition, the product range
has been purged.
However, the restructuring has coincided with the severe recession in the
luxury goods market. Italian newspaper readers were astonished this month to
see discreet advertisements for an end of season sale at Gucci's flagship
stores in Milan's via Montenapoleone.
Sales are estimated to have fallen from more than Dollars 300m three years
ago to less than Dollars 180m, while a profit of Dollars 50m has been
reversed into a loss of more than Dollars 30m. Gucci is also reported to be
struggling with a serious liquidity problem.
Matters have not been helped by the increasingly strained relations between
Mr Gucci and Investcorp.
Late last year, strong rumours circulated that the company, or a significant
stake, was to be sold to the UK's Dunhill group.
The reports, swiftly denied, were immediately attributed by Mr Gucci's aides
to an ill-advised attempt by Investcorp to step up the pressure on the
family at an increasingly difficult time in the market.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Iraq and
Opec give oil the jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL market has been jittery as it looked for something concrete to
emerge from talks between Iraq and the United Nations as well as for some
direction from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Expectations that Iraq would be allowed to return to the oil market, albeit
with limited sales, knocked prices down to Dollars 15.98 a barrel early on
Monday - the lowest level since the Gulf War in 1991. But an announcement
from Opec of an emergency meeting to be held next Wednesday in Vienna pushed
prices back up to Dollars 16.71 by the end of the day.
On Wednesday Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said Opec was
facing its worst crisis since 1986, when prices fell from Dollars 30 to
Dollars 15 a barrel in a few days after excess production. Since May this
year oil has fallen by Dollars 3 a barrel because of over-production by Opec
members and the threat of Iraq's return to the market.
But on Thursday Mr Jean Ping, Opec president, postponed next week's
emergency meeting until at least the second week of August. He explained
that the organisation had not had enough time for proper consultations. The
Brent September price slipped back to Dollars 16.50 a barrel.
Opec members are already producing between 24.3m and 24.5m barrels a day
compared with their own ceiling of 23.6m b/d set at their last meeting in
early June. The market feared that Iraq was close to a deal with the UN to
allow it to supply Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil - between 500,000 and 600,000
b/d - over six months.
Yesterday the market recovered some of Thursday's losses. The talks between
Iraq and the UN were seen as unlikely to resume until next week. Until the
outcome of the talks is known, there is little point in Opec making any
decisions.
The London Metal Exchange this week described a rise of 46 per cent in its
turnover for 1992 as 'heartening,' since the base metals industry had
suffered more than most in what had proved to be a difficult trading year.
The difficulties have continued this year, particularly for tin and nickel
which have hit 20-year and six-year lows respectively this week.
Three-month nickel crashed through the Dollars 5,000 a tonne barrier on
Tuesday as stocks in LME warehouses rose by 1,332 tonnes to a new record of
97,104 tonnes.
This reversed the recent draw-down which took LME stocks from 96,000 tonnes
to 85,476 tonnes at the beginning of the month. In the first half of the
year the nickel market saw strong consumption by the stainless steel
industry, tight supplies of stainless steel scrap and less metal exported
from the CIS.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, said that things had now turned round completely, with
exports from the CIS resuming just as stainless steel scrap was becoming
readily available. 'The downward pressure will be maintained. We are heading
for 100,000 tonnes of stocks this autumn,' he said.
Yesterday LME warehouse stocks of nickel rose by a further 1,920 tonnes. The
three-month price closed at Dollars 4,910 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 157.50
on the week.
Coincidentally three-month tin also crashed through Dollars 5,000 a tonne
this week, taking the price well below most mines' production costs. The
move came on Wednesday, after the price hit a record low of MDollars 12.50
in Kuala Lumpur. Traders blamed selling from China and Brazil, the high
level of stocks and lack of consumer interest. In addition Vietnam has
emerged as a seller recently, and scrap is coming out of Russia.
Three-month tin closed yesterday at Dollars 4,945 a tonne, down Dollars
97.50 on the week. At the beginning of the year it was above Dollars 6,000 a
tonne.
Stocks in LME warehouses are about 120 tonnes off recent highs at 20,395
tonnes. But worldwide stocks are thought to be about 40,000 tonnes, the
highest level since 1986 and equivalent to about 12 weeks' consumption.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst with Commodities Research Unit, suggested that
the price could now force some weak producers to call it a day. Only then
could the market form a base.
Gold managed to end the week above Dollars 390 a troy ounce after testing
support at Dollars 388 on Thursday on the London bullion market. It closed
yesterday at Dollars 390.50, down Dollars 3 in the week.
Dealers said this price level reflected diminishing hopes for a test of
Dollars 400 on the current swing.
Robusta coffee prices have held up well following the disappearance of the
Brazilian frost scare. September coffee closed yesterday at Dollars 992 a
tonne, up Dollars 15 on the week.
The growing credibility of the Latin American coffee retention scheme is
behind the relative strength of the market, analysts said. This week
Colombia and Central American countries said after a meeting in Guatemala
City that they had sufficient controls to implement the scheme from October,
while eight African countries, including the Ivory Coast, Uganda and Kenya,
are thought to be ready to join it.
Next week the Latin American producers meet in Rio de Janeiro to thrash out
the rules for the scheme, which aims to withhold 20 per cent of their coffee
exports from the market. If the Africans join them, the new Association of
Coffee Producing Countries will represent more than 64 per cent of world
production.

FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: A diet too rich for the digestion /
Analysis of the rapid expansion and demise of Conder Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH flow difficulties are hampering the efforts of small companies to beat
recession.
That is the considered opinion of Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, president of
the British Chamber of Commerce, who on BBC's Today programme earlier this
week called on larger companies to ease the cash squeeze on their smaller
brethren by paying bills on time.
As a former chairman of the specialist builder, Conder Group, which went
into liquidation just last week, he is particularly well-placed to know
about cash flow difficulties.
The demise of Conder went largely unremarked in the City.
It seemed like just another construction company in a raft of builders to go
under. However, for Conder's employees - who held 26 per cent of the company
through the staff trust, which eventually forced Mr Stewart-Smith's
resignation - the company's failure after 45 years prompted questions over
the group's management and corporate advice which still remain unanswered.
A report compiled at the beginning of this year by administrative receivers,
Price Waterhouse, pinpointed factors behind Conder's demise which many had
foreseen four years earlier. Specific reference was made to losses incurred
in companies acquired during 1988 and 1989, when Mr Stewart-Smith was
chairman.
The receivers also stated that the company had been adversely affected by
the severe economic downturn. However, observers have claimed that Conder -
which once boasted Britain's leading position in steel fabricated buildings
 -might have survived recession had it not been for the acquisition binge
which drained it of cash and resources.
Events at the company in the early 1990s appear to support this view.
According to a board memo of September 1992, the seven companies purchased
between 1988 and 1990 had cost Conder roughly Pounds 74m in purchase price
and subsequent losses.
Mr Stewart-Smith, who declined to discuss Conder's demise, joined Conder at
the invitation of its former chairman and co-founder, Mr Robin Cole, in June
1987.
A former main board director of P&amp;O Steam Navigation and chairman of P&amp;O
Cruises, he seemed the ideal candidate to revive the company following its
disastrous foray into the Iraqi market.
The company's bitter experience there, where it incurred heavy losses in the
mid-1980s, was reflected in its share price of about 36p, against a
flotation price of about 90p.
The City-smart Mr Stewart-Smith could not have been more different from the
management which had run Conder for 40 years. He set about polishing up the
company's image in the Square Mile by appointing advisers such as Cazenove,
Morgan Grenfell and KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock.
The board was also streamlined, removing long-serving operational directors
in favour of faces more familiar to the City such as Sir John Stanley, a
former minister of state for Northern Ireland.
Then, in 1988, Conder began a rapid expansion programme, spending almost
Pounds 21m on seven acquisitions in two years. Fund managers and analysts
warmed to the more dynamic approach and the shares rose to a peak of 228p in
1989, for a market capitalisation of Pounds 94m.
Insiders were less enthusiastic about the new strategy, particularly the
Pounds 2m purchase of Elemeta, a specialised wall-cladding group with
prestigious contracts for London's Broadgate development and America Square.
Employees and shareholders warned Mr Stewart-Smith about the potential
dangers. Conder, with turnover of about Pounds 130m, was used to smaller
contracts than those taken on by the loss-making Elemeta, they said. America
Square and Broadgate alone represented almost 20 per cent of Conder's
turnover.
Yet there was a more basic flaw in the purchase of Elemeta, which only those
on the ground at Conder could really appreciate.
The cladding deals negotiated by Elemeta were manufacturing contracts. 'What
Conder management knew was construction,' says a former employee. Partly due
to this lack of knowledge, the prices eventually agreed on the contracts
were far too low.
Other acquisitions followed, all of which appeared logical individually.
However, there were several factors which should have prompted caution.
Most purchases were for cash rather than shares. Moreover, the money came
from cashflow or borrowings. Conder made no rights issues.
In 1990, Conder had sales of roughly Pounds 290m while shareholders' funds
had fallen from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 7.6m. Net debt of Pounds 20m left an
unhealthy level of gearing.
Furthermore, former employees say, some of the cash funding these
acquisitions came in part from the positive cash flow arising on contracts.
This left little margin for error when the company suffered both a sudden
decline in turnover - which drained cash - and delays on Elemeta's
contracts.
Finally, and perhaps most crucially, Conder did not have the management
resources to deal with such rapid growth; nor with the problems presented by
the acquisition of several loss-making companies. Mr Pelham, like Mr
Stewart-Smith a product of the McKinsey school of management consultants,
had about 20 people reporting to him - including some of the managers of the
loss-making purchases.
Morale within the company rapidly deteriorated. Representatives of the staff
trust were unhappy as their relationship with the revamped board became more
difficult. Accustomed to an operationally-based management, the staff felt
that many of their questions and anxieties were not being being dealt with.
The trust was also aware that Conder had been in discussions with bankers
from August 1990. This was when the group realised that losses on Elemeta's
contracts would hit double figures. The final figure, however, was higher
than even they suspected - a total of Pounds 40m over three years, including
the acquisition price.
Elemeta, the rapid succession of purchases, and the collapse in the
construction market had left Conder lurching from month to month. It was
then that the group sought to sell some of its businesses to feed its need
for cash.
After Conder reported losses of Pounds 19m for 1990, against profits Pounds
10.42m in 1989, the staff trust told directors it intended to call for the
resignation of Mr Stewart-Smith at the annual meeting in its role as a
significant shareholder. Instead, Mr Stewart-Smith agreed to resign as chief
executive, and Mr Pelham stepped down before the agm. Mr Alan Lovell, the
finance director, took over as acting chief executive in June 1991.
There followed a dramatic streamlining which left Conder with 1,100
employees by September 1992, compared with about 3,000 previously. The group
sold six businesses and closed down six manufacturing plants in the UK and
US. Yet Conder, desperate for cash, still needed to raise about Pounds 15m
to continue operating.
It soon became apparent, however, that the bulk of investors could
ill-afford to subscribe to a rights issue. In addition to the staff trust,
individual employees held 9 per cent, while the Conder Conservation Trust,
an environmental charity, held 11 per cent. The Cole family held 10 per
cent.
The only remaining options were to sell a core business or even the whole
group. Both of these routes were almost achieved, only to fail at the last
minute.
By last September, after 25 months of supporting the struggling group, the
banks had had enough. Receivers stepped in and, within weeks, Conder's
businesses were snapped up.
Former employees are still bitter. The demise of one of Britain's leading
specialist builders was even harder to comprehend when the final figures
were announced. During the last six months of its existence, Conder had
returned to profit.

FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone secures agreement with lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Hartstone looked more secure yesterday after the hosiery and
leather goods group announced that it has reached agreement with its lenders
on a formal standstill arrangement pending a longer-term refinancing, writes
Paul Taylor.
The board also said it had reached agreement with its group of 14 lenders on
new facilities to cover the group's anticipated new money requirements until
the expiry of the standstill arrangement on January 16.
Hartstone's share price gained 7p to close at 56p yesterday.
The group stunned the City at the end of June by announcing Pounds 31m
above-the-line costs, to cover rationalisation charges, write-downs and
exceptional restructuring costs, and a Pounds 9.86m pre-tax loss for the
full year.
Hartstone announced at the time that it had breached banking covenants and
had begun refinancing talks with its bankers.
Yesterday Mr Shaun Dowling, executive chairman, said;'The signing of the
standstill arrangement and the provision of new money represent a
significant step in ensuring Hartstone's future.
The new money facilities include:
Cash advances and letters of credit facilities provided by the CIT
Group/Commercial Services under a new secured arrangement with Hartstone's
two principal US subsidiaries, Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens, to
support their working capital requirements.
A FFr35m cash advance facility provided by the UK bank group through
Hartstone to Cogetex, the group's French hosiery company. In addition the
French bankers to Cogetex and Sotexa will provide a secured facility of
FFr50m backed by a guarantee of a similar amount from the UK bank group.
Overdraft and letter of credit facilities of Pounds 5.4m for Hartstone to
cover the requirements of its UK and Hong Kong businesses.

FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury seeks Pounds 20.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAFTESBURY, a property company focused on London's West End, yesterday
announced a Pounds 20.8m placing and open offer to strengthen its balance
sheet and make acquisitions.
The 24.3m shares are being issued at 88p per share on a 1-for-1 basis. The
placing has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.
The company said it needed the issue to allow it to take advantage of the
investment opportunities which are expected to arise as the property market
recovers.
Shaftesbury said it expected to expand its property interests, chiefly in
the West End of London, where it currently owns 32 properties on its
Chinatown Estate by Shaftesbury Avenue. It does not intend to undertake
speculative developments.
The issue will reduce the company's borrowings to Pounds 16.3m and its
gearing to 39 per cent, based on its net assets at the end of last
September.
Some shareholders, with an entitlement of 11.79m new shares, have undertaken
not to subscribe and these shares will be placed. The balance of 12.5m new
shares will be placed subject to clawback under the open offer.
The company is undertaking a capital reorganisation to reduce the nominal
value of its shares, to permit the issue to go ahead. It will also seek to
eliminate the deficit on its distributable reserves to allow dividend
payments to be resumed. Assuming it makes sufficient distributable profits
in the year to September 30 1994, the directors intend to pay a dividend for
that year following the AGM in 1995.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Black Arrow Group, the office furniture and leasing finance company,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 2.03m for
the year to end-March.
The outcome was struck on turnover up by Pounds 3.87m to Pounds 20.4m - the
figures are prepared on an FRS 3 basis.
Mr Arnold Edward, chairman, said the improvement had been achieved despite
poor trading conditions over the period, although they had been reinforced
by an exceptional gain of Pounds 668,000 on the sale of a trading property.
However, since the year end there had been a deterioration, he added, and
trading profits were likely to be depressed in the first half of the current
year.
A maintained final dividend of 1.6p is proposed making 2.6p (2.1p) for the
year. The dividend is almost twice covered by earnings of 5.02p (3.79p) per
share.

PROFITS of Southend Property fell from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 1.15m pre-tax
for the year to March 31. A fall in turnover from Pounds 81.1m to Pounds
31.75m reflected disposals of property and non-property interests.
During the year the group's property investments continued to produce growth
in rental income but, reflecting the falls in property values, fully diluted
net assets per share declined by 16p to 100p.
As announced in the recent open offer document, the final dividend is to be
held at 2.73p making a 4.25p (4.18p) total. Earnings per share fell to 0.1p
(2.6p).
With 'evidence emerging of a recovery in the property market' the group has
exchanged contracts to acquire a 'large' town centre commercial estate in
Liverpool for Pounds 5m in conjunction with Haigside and Western Securities.
Southend will have a 50 per cent equity interest in the joint venture.

FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The scrutiny of a most unlikely alliance -
Medeva's future following a tough week on the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW CORPORATE bosses could be more grateful that this weekend has arrived
than Mr Bernard Taylor and Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, respectively chairman and
managing director of Medeva.
Within the space of a week, they have watched the stock market value of
their rapidly growing drug company halve from Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m,
following what looked like a modest profits warning on Monday.
Worst of all, investors have deserted the company in droves, apparently no
longer prepared to believe that Medeva can manage its novel strategy of
building a pharmaceuticals company by acquisition rather than through
research and development.
The company that has attracted suspicion and excitement in equal measure,
but was gathering support thanks to the persuasive efforts of Mr Taylor and
Mr Gowrie-Smith, has stopped dead in its tracks.
Medeva's share price collapse was triggered by loss of operating control at
two subsidiaries in the US. IMS, in California, which supplies hospitals
with drug delivery systems, discovered its sales were lower than reported
because stocks had doubled at its wholesalers' warehouses.
More seriously, MD Pharmaceutical, which makes the Federal controlled
amphetamine, methylphenidate, had been told by the Food and Drug
Administration that it had 'serious deviations' from good manufacturing
practice which were causing drugs to be 'adulterated'. Closed briefly, MD is
operating again but awaiting the FDA's judgment on whether changes it has
implemented are adequate.
While profits are now forecast to fall Pounds 10m below expectations to
about Pounds 45m in 1993 - still a 25 per cent increase on the year but a
fall in earnings per share - the real damage has been done to management
credibility .
Not surprisingly, shareholders who provided Pounds 320m in rights issues and
placings to fund this growth are putting the partnership between Mr
Gowrie-Smith and Mr Taylor under intense scrutiny.
It was always a most unlikely alliance: Mr Gowrie-Smith, the deal-maker from
a stockbroking and corporate finance background in Australia; Mr Taylor,
corporation climber who rose to chief executive of Glaxo, one of the UK's
most successful companies in the 1980s, before being ruthlessly removed in a
boardroom coup.
Mr Gowrie-Smith's path is the most colourful. He made his seed money in the
1980s in what he once described as 'hectic market trading' in Sydney. A true
entrepreneur, he once registered The Frozen Yoghurt Company name in case a
fashion in the US at the time took off in Australia. The company never
traded but it was the kind of venture that gave Mr Gowrie-Smith a more racy
profile than he might have wanted a decade later as the head of an
international pharmaceuticals concern.
His breakthrough came when he found a stock market vehicle, Griffiths Bros,
a tea company into which he backed a number of investments including a
greatly under-valued natural resources company. But outflanked by a partner
in 1986, he was forced to sell his stake.
Cash rich but without a vehicle, Mr Gowrie-Smith was skiing in Aspen,
Colorado, six months ahead of the 1987 crash, when he realised the world
stock markets were overheating. He moved to London, and with the help of
stockbrokers TC Coombes floated Medirace to exploit research into cancer and
Aids treatments being developed by scientists at London's Hammersmith
Hospital.
The story of Contracan, the compound developed by Medirace, is
controversial. The scientists claimed that Contracan in animal tests had
'inhibited the spread of cancer and progression of Aids infection.'
Contracan's scientific pedigree was also endorsed by Mr Taylor two years
later when, to an excited buzz in the City, he emerged as a possible head of
Medirace after leaving Glaxo.
This view was not universally held. According to one of the most respected
drug sector analysts - and now a fan of Medeva which Medirace was to become
 -the claims for Contracan were never likely to stand up to scrutiny.
Contracan, indeed, sank without trace when Mr Taylor stopped the research
programme six months after coming on board.
The transformation from a speculative company developing a single drug to
today's Medeva, with sales of Pounds 157m last year, depended on Mr Taylor
coming on board.
After a long career in Glaxo's marketing department, Mr Taylor had risen by
1985 to the chief executive slot under the chairmanship of Sir Paul
Girolami. Years of development had preceded him, but Mr Taylor is credited
with having overseen the period of Glaxo's growth when Zantac became the
world's largest selling drug.
While Mr Gowrie-Smith was raising Pounds 1.2m to float Medirace in 1987, Mr
Taylor was publicly proclaiming that Glaxo would join Merck, Hoechst and
Ciba-Geigy among the world's top drug companies.
Then, out of the blue in 1989, Mr Taylor resigned. In a legendary meeting at
the Venice home of Sir Paul Mr Taylor was replaced by Mr Ernest Mario,
considered then and until he too departed in March, as better suited to be
heir-apparent at Glaxo.
The next day Mr Gowrie-Smith asked Mr Taylor to join Medirace. After
hesitating, Mr Taylor said he would join on condition that Medirace went
ahead with an Pounds 87m deal to buy Evans Medical, a maker of cheap generic
drugs.
It was a marriage of convenience. For Mr Taylor, it was a way back and a
chance to make a serious amount of money. For Mr Gowrie-Smith, Glaxo's
ex-chief executive lent Medirace the credibility it clearly lacked;
Medirace's new advisers, Laing and Cruickshank, who underwrote the rights
issue with Mr Gowrie-Smith also knew that Mr Taylor had sold Evans to its
management three years earlier when he was at Glaxo and knew the business
backwards.
That first acquisition led to 15 other deals. While Mr Taylor grew
accustomed to his strategy being questioned in a manner he never faced at
Glaxo, Mr Gowrie-Smith progressed from just putting the deals together to
presenting them to analysts, experts who three years ago would have run
rings around him.
For the moment, however, the wheels have come off. Mr Taylor says the IMS
and MD mishaps resulted from weak management control. But while Mr Taylor
says that responsibility for this management problem 'lies at one place and
that is on my desk', it is the deal-making Mr Gowrie-Smith, if anyone, who
looks most exposed.
Only when confidence in management is restored will Medeva be able to resume
the acquisition-led policy Mr Taylor says investors backed management to do.
By Mr Taylor's measure, confidence will have been restored when Medeva's
price earnings ratio is back in line with the sector average, implying the
share price needs to almost double from the 108p close yesterday.
And in the meantime, what role will Mr Gowrie-Smith assume? Mr Taylor says
he needs a little time to respond to that. While he sees no reason why
Medeva's path can not resume, 'the consequences of it (the acquisition
freeze) are still to be fully identified.'

THE Taiwanese government is poised to increase its stake in the proposed
joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation
from 29 per cent to 39 per cent in an effort to convince Taiwanese banks to
lend more cash to the project.
The government is also likely to step up pressure on private sector
investors to put up capital to reduce the risks to creditor banks.
The success of the Dollars 250m (Pounds 167m) venture is vital to BAe's
recovery strategy. Its loss-making RJ range of regional jet aircraft would
be manufactured in Taiwan, close to the rapidly growing markets of east
Asia, and with lower labour costs.
Mr Yang Shih-chien, Taiwan's deputy minister of economic affairs, said
yesterday that government officials had agreed on these changes to try to
conclude talks on the joint venture by July 31, a deadline set by BAe's
board.
Earlier this week Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, visited Taiwan in an
effort to reassure Taiwanese banks of the viability of the venture and to
restate the deadline.
BAe said yesterday that the deadline was not final and would be reviewed if
necessary.
Under yesterday's proposals, which still need cabinet approval, the
Executive Yuan Development Fund would hold 29 per cent of the venture (up
from 24 per cent) and the Chiao Tung Bank will hold 10 per cent (up from 5
per cent). Both are state- controlled.
Mr Yang also said the China Development Corporation (CDC) whose main
shareholder is the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party, had indicated it would
also buy into the joint venture if the Chiao Tung Bank raised its stake.
He said about 15 per cent of the capital needed was still uncommitted. 'We
just need to find two or three investors willing to put up a 5 per cent
share.'
The economic affairs ministry would 'actively assist TAC in getting existing
private sector stockholders to increase their investment or find new private
investors,' Mr Yang said.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Selling the family silver: Lean times for Lloyd's Names
</HEADLINE>

As the Glorious Twelfth, approaches, fewer sportsmen than usual are
preparing for the start of the grouse-shooting season - not just because of
an expected shortage of birds.
Record losses at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, are forcing many
Names - the individuals whose personal wealth supports the market  - to
cancel their traditional sporting holidays and to cut spending on field
sports such as salmon fishing and hunting.
So far relatively few Names have had to sell their homes, but Lloyd's losses
 -which now amount to more than Pounds 5.5bn over the past five years - are
beginning to have an impact on other businesses which serve the lifestyles
of the wealthy.
This year many Names have begun to raise cash through selling family
valuables, ranging from antiques to fine wines and furniture, pictures and
feudal titles, thus helping boost turnover at the country's biggest auction
houses.
'Many Names don't know how much they owe and are planning on a month to
month basis. They are disposing of all the things that aren't central to
their lives,' says Mr Patrick Ramsay, country house specialist with estate
agency, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
'For the majority of people, the first option is to cash in shares, then it
might be frivolities like shooting holidays and then their collections of
antiques and furniture,' says Mr Philip Hoffman, deputy managing director at
Christie's, the auctioneers.
Mr Jamie Illingworth, of Strutt and Parker, the estate agency which leases
sporting lodges for between Pounds 400 and Pounds 7,000 a week, has noticed
a change. 'Members of Lloyd's who got their profits cheque used to put it to
a Scottish holiday, It has definitely taken some people out of the market.
Some people have cried off,' he says.
Mr David Olive, who runs a shooting school near Andover in Hampshire, also
points to a a fall in demand from Names. During the late 1980s many Names
were regular participants in his out-of-season training and refresher
courses, but demand has tailed off by 50 per cent over the past two years.
Lloyd's problems have also contributed to the difficulties of the hunts,
some of which have reported a decline in support this year. Captain
Frederick Barker, joint master of the prestigious Quorn Hunt in
Lincolnshire, told Horse and Hound magazine recently that there 'is no doubt
that the recession and Lloyd's of London have affected us badly. That final
bit of disposable income is no longer there and subscriptions are
considerably down.'
In the fine arts and antiques market, the effect of losses on Names has been
positive. Both Christie's and Sotheby's report a surge in inquiries and
business this year. Mr Hoffman estimates that sales by Names through
Christie's could amount to between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m this year, more
than 5 per cent of the house's total turnover.
'The majority of the clients we talk to have managed to sort out their
problems up until now,' says Mr Hoffman at Christies, whose Fine English
Furniture catalogue is full of items ranging from Regency mahogany tables,
to more exotic pieces such as a George III brass-bound mahogany bucket and
William IV library globes, offered for sale as the 'property of a gentleman'
or the 'property of a lady'.
Typically, Names are selling pieces of antique furniture or pictures worth
between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 100,000. British 18th and 19th century
pictures, old Italian and Dutch masters and furniture are the kind of items
most frequently offered. Mr Hoffman reports that large numbers of English
'sporting' pictures by arists such as Stubbs have come onto the market.
He says that the impact on prices is mixed. Names who bought their artworks
in the late 1980s can expect to lose money on the sales.
The prices of English sporting pictures by artists such as Stubbs have
fallen by between 25 and 30 per cent since 1989, for example, says Mr
Hoffman. But many other quality pieces, such as Old Master paintings, some
have not been seen on the market for some time, and demand - and prices -
are buoyant.
Christie's also reports strong demand for a scheme which allows Names to
obtain 'bank guarantees' for which antiques or artwork are used as
collateral. Launched last month with the backing of Coutts &amp; Co, the bank,
the scheme allows Names to obtain bank guarantees worth 40 per cent of the
worth of the pledged artwork, which they can use to continue trading at
Lloyd's. The heirlooms are sold only if the guarantee is drawn on to cover
losses.
Sotheby's, too, says it is facing a huge number of inquiries from Names.
'Most Names will start off just looking to sell one or two big pieces,' says
Mr Mr James Miller, who runs an advisory service for Names at Sotheby's.
Sotheby's offers a special service advising Names on possible sales. Mr
Miller says it is not simply artworks which are being sold, but books, cars,
wine, silver and jewellery. Sotheby's also offers a bank guarantee service
similar to that of Christie's.
Wine, he says, has been a particularly popular choice. 'A lot of people
think that it's an indulgence they can't really keep if things are going
badly,' says Mr Miller. 'It's something that you consume - you can't hand it
on to another generation. After all, its got to be sold or drunk at some
point anyway.'
The extent of the sales activity could be even wider, since many Names are
likely to sell privately too. Roger Stiles of Fine Art Investments, a small
art dealer and consultant, says: 'A lot of Names are very reluctant to
consign their works to an auction. Obviously people are very sensitive
because an auction is a very public way of selling your work, and the prices
can be very volatile,' he says. 'If a piece that is coming onto the market
for the first time doesn't sell then it can lose its premium very quickly.'
Mr Stiles says some Names are selling valuable works, but not through the
auction houses. He has more than 200 pieces on his list now, which he thinks
are 'mostly' Lloyd's-related. 'In the past few months I have noticed a real
increase,' he says. The top value of individual works could be about Pounds
10m, although most are about the Pounds 1m mark. They include Rembrandts,
Picassos, and Cezannes. Most of them will, he says, be bought by financial
institutions, including Swiss banks, although there are also some private
buyers.
Another auctioneer reporting brisk business from Names is Mr Robert Smith,
who buys and sells feudal titles. No rights to land still attaches to titles
such as the Lordship of Walkes Colne and the Seignory of the fief of
Craqueville St Helier, although they sometimes give mineral rights. Even so
buyers are prepared to pay thousands of pounds for the social cachet
conferred on barons, earls, viscounts and marquesses. More than 100 Lloyd's
Names have sold titles this year alone, raising between Pounds 4,500 and
Pounds 100,000 each. 'It's a very painless way of raising a bit of cash,'
says Mr Smith. 'They are trying to stave off the evil day.'
The Earl of Carlisle, who has lost money with Lloyd's, raised Pounds 55,000
by selling his barony of Gilsland in Cumbria to an American. The earl, who
sold a collection of antique books, is philosophical about the latest
transaction. 'I expect we've had the title since the 1500s but it was no
more of a blow than selling any other asset.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Danger of the soft option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN J MARCHANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Over the last 10 to 15 years, like many of my colleagues I have had to
come to grips with zero defects, quality circles, Just-in-Time, 'The Lean
Machine', etc. Both as a manager and as a consultant I have tried to lead
companies down this path because I have seen the benefits it can bring, not
only in Japan. Needless to say, you must be prepared to invest a lot of hard
work and re-education at all levels.
Now I learn from your review of the Industrial Relations Services report
('Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices', July 19) that
all this was apparently in vain. As the recovery continues, 'pent-up
resentment from British workers . . . could have a devastating effect' and
'increase British industry's vulnerability'.
Are we really so stupid, as a nation, to throw away hard-won improvements by
taking the soft option? It would be interesting to hear the views of the
motor industry.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Replace arbitrary water charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letters you published from Chris Smith MP and James Skinner (July
15), concerning who pays for water purity, will find strong and widespread
support both within the conservation movement and from the wider public. May
I add that the increase in water charges under discussion, however large,
will fall even more inequitably on some consumers as we continue for the
most part to pay according to the arbitrary and obsolete rateable value of
our homes and premises. Now that the council tax is in place, this is one
unfairness that could easily be remedied.

FT  24 JUL 93 / A river runs through it: The US debate over flood controls
and the cost of relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a neighbourhood of bungalows and neatly kept gardens on the south side of
St Louis, Hannover Road dips and disappears into a rancid pool of
sewage-laden flood waters. This is not the overspill of the mighty
Mississippi river, but of a small drainage channel called the River Des
Peres, backed up into areas which stayed dry in the last great floods in
1973.
A dozen miles away, the Earth City industrial park was still farmland at the
bottom of the Missouri flood plain when the 1973 floods struck. Today its
rich, alluvial soil, encased in concrete and asphalt, remains snug behind a
massive, rock-faced levee.
All along the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers, about 3,500 miles of such
levees, ranging from private earth embankments to the solid flood walls
built by the US Army Corps of Engineers, protect river basin land from
flooding.
But when a huge levee like Earth City's stops the river from spilling over
into the flood plain where it has spread for centuries, it finds an outlet
elsewhere - in St Charles County across the bridge, now half-submerged, or
even further downstream, where it forces the River Des Peres back up into a
residential area of south St Louis.
Some voices, mostly environmentalists, but also members of Congress faced
with voting more money to meet the disaster, now suggest the levees may be
making matters worse, both by pushing the flood waters higher and by
encouraging planners and developers to site homes and industrial buildings
on the flood-prone bottomlands.
'There's a large part of me that's unsympathetic to people who knowingly
build in the flood plain,' says Mr Jay Lewis, a St Louis building inspector
who says he has come across repeated examples of lawyers redrawing official
maps to certify that a site is outside the flood area, in defiance of
topographical reality.
Over the past 25 years, the number of homes built in flood areas has risen
by 40 per cent. Despite improved dams and levees, floods continue to wreak
havoc, averaging Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of property damage and 124
deaths a year in the 1980s.
The National Flood Insurance Programme, a federal government scheme set up
in 1968, provides cover. Yet even though the premiums are well below market
cost, averaging about Dollars 300 for Dollars 85,000 of cover, only 2.6m
properties, out of about 9m to 11m properties at risk, take advantage of the
programme.
'Those who don't buy aren't stupid. They know that the government will step
in with disaster relief,' says Mr Sheldon Richman, a fierce critic of the
flood insurance programme at the Cato Institute, a Washington think tank.
It is usual for Congress to throw budget disciplines to the winds and vote
readily for disaster relief. Despite procedural obstacles in the House of
Representatives, it is expected to do so again next week for the Dollars
2.98bn of flood aid requested by President Bill Clinton.
'The bottom line is this: the American taxpayer is picking up the cost of
predictable disasters, and the American taxpayer is subsidising people to
live by the beach and the flood plains,' says Senator John Kerry, a Democrat
from Massachusetts.
However predictable those disasters are, protecting against floods remains a
question of assessing probabilities. The Army Corps of Engineers, which has
primary responsibility for flood control and navigation along the
Mississippi and Missouri, builds its levees for urban areas high enough to
keep out the sort of flood that only comes along once every 500 years. On
the St Louis flood gauge - a measure of the river's height - this is
estimated at 52 feet, against the record crest of 47 feet earlier this week,
and 43 feet in the 1973 floods.
For farmland, the corps builds only for a 50-year flood, or 45 feet on the
St Louis gauge.
The River Des Peres area of south St Louis, however, was left out of the
flood control system which the corps built for the city in 1959-63. The area
was then much less built up and the corps estimated the cost would not have
been justified. It has a levee built after the 1973 floods by the city and
county of St Louis to cope only with a 37-foot flood. Earth City's levee, on
the other hand, although privately built, is geared for a 500-year flood.
Politics, money and cost-benefit analyses have all played a part in the
level of flood protection provided to different areas in the basin. Critics
say the corps has, on occasion, altered its flood plain impact reports under
political pressure in order to permit development in areas that would
otherwise have remained unimproved land bringing in little tax revenue.
Mr Joe Schwenk, the chief levee specialist at the corps office in St Louis,
acknowledges that levees, by constricting the river, may have increased the
level of flooding this year by 2 to 3 feet, although he argues that this is
more than offset by the containment reservoirs the corps has built upstream
on tributaries such as the Salt River.
Mr Schwenk maintains that the flood of 1993 is a 100-year flood. With rain
falling at more than twice normal levels for months on end over nine
midwestern states which drain into the the Mississippi-Missouri, nobody
doubts that this year's flood is unusual, but some river watchers disagree
with Mr Schwenk on just how unusual it is.
'This is a 20-year flood. The same flood occurred in 1973, but it has been
greatly aggravated because the river has not been allowed to flow into its
natural flood plain,' says Mr Lewis, the St Louis building inspector.
'We seem to get these 100-year floods every 20 years,' says Mr Thomas Dunn,
general manager of Gateway Riverboat Cruise, which operates excursion boats
from St Louis and which has suffered heavy peak-season losses. He adds,
however, that this flood differs from 1973 in its duration.
As heavy rain persists, the return to normal is expected to be slow. The
Mississippi is expected to take at least seven weeks to drop below flood
level, although some river traffic may resume before that.
When the waters subside, there is little doubt that basin residents and the
federal government will want to build bigger and better levees. Flooded
towns will seek to match their drier neighbours' ramparts foot for foot.
River des Peres is likely to be at the head of the list, particularly as its
congressman, Mr Richard Gephardt, is the leader of the majority Democrats in
the House of Representatives. He has asked the corps to recommend 'a
long-term course of action' to improve the flood control system. Corps
engineers say that, unless they are ordered by Congress to factor intangible
elements such as human suffering into their calculations, they would
probably still find a River Des Peres levee economically unjustified.
Even the most ardent advocates of leaving the river untrammelled do not
suggest tearing down factories and homes in the flood plain.
Despite Congress' willingness to cough up for disaster relief, the Federal
government deficit looms as a reminder that government money is scarce. Some
natural controls favoured by environmentalists, such as planning
restrictions to leave undeveloped bottomlands open to flooding, could be
cheaper than structural measures. After years of trying to engineer floods
out of existence, the time may have come for a more adaptive approach.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Tax solution to inequality
</HEADLINE>

   From Mr GEOFF BEACON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's article, 'No easy answers to job questions' (July 21),
points out that the American solution to unemployment is dependent on rising
inequality - a solution which is not favoured in Europe.
This was juxtaposed with your leader on the environment ('Clarifying the
green agenda'), which correctly points out that the cost of measures to
limit damage to the environment has pushed environmental concerns down the
political agenda.
Surely the answer is easy. Tax the pollution caused by the excessive
consumption of the affluent and subsidise those that are less affluent and
less polluting.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Priorities for the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANE PRESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your call for clearly stated priorities in environmental policy I
would add that clear analysis is essential to establishing such priorities.
In this vein, you cannot both state that global warming is 'the most
important single global risk' and recommend that governments 'cast a
sceptical eye over our renewable energy'. Energy production and use is the
principal source of greenhouse gas emissions, and abatement policies
necessarily imply the adoption of fossil fuel alternatives.
Second, it is not fair to say recycling has 'become a moral crusade for the
green movement' when, in fact, major environmental campaigns call first for
waste minimisation, and promote recycling as a last resort. Industry has had
a much bigger role in inflating the virtues of recycling, finding it a more
convenient response to 'green pressures' than fundamental reform of
activities to reduce natural resource utilisation per se.

   From Ms BARBARA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In your welcome attempt to sort out environmental priorities ('Clarifying
the green agenda', July 21), you identify one of the most pressing political
issues of the decade.
You rightly emphasise the urgent need to assess the threat of climatic
change and to curb emissions. However, in arguing that conserving
biodiversity is the 'most overblown issue of all' you fail to see that the
balanced relationships between the species that make up an ecosystem are as
important as the species themselves. They stem from interactions, many as
yet imperfectly understood, between millions of species. Human life depends
on the stability of these relationships: their preservation is certainly not
'conservation for its own sake'. By suggesting that we simply catalogue and
preserve species in a 'Noah's Ark', you are indulging in a 'Jurassic Park'
fantasy.
Sustainable economic activity depends on the maintenance of biodiversity. It
therefore requires that we manage our resources in ways that do not
irreparably damage ecosystems. Recycling and the use of renewable energy are
therefore important. Narrow attitudes got us into this mess. The sooner we
all recognise that we are part of the planet's ecosystems, not independent
of them, the better.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Trade associations are not mainly political
lobbyists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From COL W T WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Taylor's article 'Lobbying not worth a button' (July 15) must
not be allowed to pass without comment. I am sorry my response is so delayed
but I have just returned from leading a trade mission to Tehran; very
successful, despite many problems on the way.
I must challenge the statement: 'The principal role of trade association is
to lobby government . . .'. This displays a degree of ignorance of the real
world that in itself casts doubts on whether the Department of Trade and
Industry lives on planet earth or elsewhere. The Engineering Industries
Association, a fairly substantial organisation with affiliates of some 2,000
small and medium-sized mechanical/electrical engineering companies, does not
see its main role as lobbying. Indeed, this is a fair way down its list of
priorities. The EIA is a 'one-stop shop'. We help our members with
legislative, commercial, financial or any other problems. We run
exhibitions; we sponsor overseas trade missions. We obtain trade
opportunities at home and overseas; we offer excellent courses/seminars at
low cost and we help with contractual problems.
When the government gets it wrong, as regrettably it all too frequently
does, then my members tell the secretary of state and will continue to do
so.
This dreadful old lobbying chestnut, as Lord Devlin's report demonstrates,
really ought to be buried.
We live in a parliamentary democracy. This means all voices must be heard.
The EIA's certainly will be. Convenience of ministers does not register very
far up the priority list. The secretary of state should listen to all voices
and decide on the course of action he wishes to pursue. He has more than
sufficient staff to help him.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Morbid twist to a scandalous saga: Victims of Italy's
crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suicide has shrouded Italy's corruption scandals in the trappings of
classical tragedy.
The deaths this week, first of Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of
ENI, the state oil concern, and yesterday Raul Gardini, the leading Italian
financial entrepreneur of the 1980s, have injected a note of high drama into
the extraordinary process of change brought about by the 18-month judicial
investigations into illicit financing of political parties.
So far 10 persons under investigation have taken their lives. But Mr
Cagliari and Mr Gardini have touched a particular national nerve. Both were
captains of industry, one state, the other private-sector. They symbolised
the heady success of the 1980s and both had fallen from their pedestals.
Charges had yet to be pressed against Mr Gardini, but the investigative net
was closing in on him. Mr Cagliari had already admitted to knowing about at
least L50bn (Pounds 20.95m) worth of illicit funding channelled through ENI
and its subsidiaries to the Socialist and Christian Democrat parties.
The human tragedy, however, has not obscured the backdrop against which
these events occurred. 'The common thread behind these deaths is the
collapse of the conditions in which each of these personalities lived and
operated,' observed Mr Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary
anti-Mafia commission.
It is a compelling thesis to see the suicides as the final stages of a
post-war political-economic system that has become hopelessly discredited.
Neither Mr Cagliari nor Mr Gardini could be called innocents. The
67-year-old former ENI chairman was both a servant of, and an accomplice in,
the system being ruthlessly exposed by magistrates. Over the past year, ENI
has emerged as the largest single source of illicit funding for the
political parties. For his part, Mr Gardini exploited the system and played
by its rules, even if this meant paying politicians in return for commercial
privilege.
Nevertheless the manner of the deaths induces pathos and sympathy. Mr
Cagliari killed himself with a plastic bag over his head, tied with a
shoelace, after being held for 133 days in prison. In a suicide note he said
he was protesting against the Milan magistrates' refusal to grant him bail.
Mr Gardini shot himself as yesterday's papers printed extracts of damning
testimony from Mr Giuseppe Garofano, his former management colleague at
Ferruzzi-Montedison, alleging fraudulent practices in Italy's second-largest
private group. Mr Gardini was alleged to have arranged up to L100bn in
political bribes, raised through off-balance sheet property deals, and
accused of illicitly covering a hole of more than Dollars 350m caused by
commodity trading losses. These accusations appeared in extracts released by
Il Mondo magazine which has consistently published reliable testimony from
interrogations in the scandals.
The immediate effect of the deaths has been to expose a growing division
between those who wish to halt the power of the magistrates - and by the
same token rein in the scope of their investigations - and those who want a
cathartic indictment of the political system that has ruled Italy since
1945.
In the first group are the bulk of businessmen and the politicians. This is
not surprising. Since one in six parliamentarians is under investigation for
corruption, they have a vested interest. The business community is genuinely
afraid that a concerted investigation of business methods risks invalidating
most company balance sheets.
This week, some politicians have tried to exploit Mr Cagliari's death to
confuse the issue between the magistrates' methods and the scope of their
inquiries. As a result, the magistrates will be obliged to use more
restrictively their considerable powers of preventive detention.
But the magistrates cannot be forced to halt their investigations without a
battle between the judiciary and the legislature. Significantly, Mr Cagliari
was the first top public-sector figure to be arrested, and his detention on
March 9 came immediately after a public outcry had forced President Oscar
Scalfaro to reject government proposals for an amnesty of those involved in
the corruption scandals.
The evidence this week suggests that despite public shock and personal
sympathy over the suicides, most people are firmly behind the magistrates.
The current parliament would enjoy little support for legislating an end to
the investigative process.
But pressure for such legislation might come from the many companies, state
and private, which have incurred losses through a combination of greater
international competition and recession. Mr Gardini's death will further
complicate the rescue of the Ferruzzi group, will affect four or five
leading financiers who were his associates, and will touch on the banks
which are exposed to Ferruzzi's L31,000bn debt.
Other big groups - Fiat, De Benedetti's Olivetti and Berlusconi's Fininvest
 -are caught up in the corruption scandals and risk damage from further
probes. The magistrates have yet to decide whether to tackle the
state-controlled banking sector - which would be the most sensitive
investigation of all.

FT  24 JUL 93 / The worst result for the Tories: Defeat in yesterday's vote
and in a subsequent election could have healed the Conservative party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best thing that could have happened to the Conservative party yesterday
would have been a defeat for the government on its confidence motion. A
general election would have followed, and the Tories would have enjoyed the
glorious, healing relief of a period of opposition.
We can be sure of that. Britain's present administration is exceedingly
unpopular, not least among its own supporters. It is hard to find a
Conservative who respects the abilities of ministers; too easy to find many
who express a fair contempt for the prime minister. Most of the evidence is
anecdotal, but it does appear that everyone is fed up with the Tories. There
is no discernible difference according to age or gender. As to social
grouping, there is an apparent bias towards extreme anger among houseowners,
pensioners and members of the aspirant working classes who previously
supported the Conservatives. Many such people feel that they were hoodwinked
by the promises made during the election of April 1992. We saw the effect of
their fury at the recent Newbury by-election, and may witness it again in
Christchurch on Thursday.
This is not to say that the country would be better governed by Labour or a
Lab-Lib coalition. As matters stand, the judicious answer to such a
suggestion is 'probably not'. But the readiness or otherwise of the Labour
party for government and the quality of Mr John Smith's leadership are
distant topics, to be properly discussed when a real election is called.
Perhaps the Labour leader will have wrestled the trade unions to the ground
by then, and we may all look upon his party in a different light. Possibly
Mr Paddy Ashdown will come to resemble a viable Liberal Democratic prime
minister-in waiting. There is always time for miracles. We must wait.
The matter at issue this weekend is the state of the Conservative and
Unionist party, the one that has governed Britain since 1979. Its condition
is, frankly, appalling. Its leader's performance is erratic. He moves in
fits and starts, at times skilfully, too often with the clumsiness of the
apprentice. When Mr John Major took over in November 1990, his
administration was amateurish. He could hardly be blamed for that: even his
best friends would agree that he was promoted too soon, after too short a
preparation for the highest office. The prime minister, his staff, and his
close colleagues have learnt much since then, but it would be stretching
kindness to say that Downing Street has become the home of a smoothly oiled
machine, tended by professionals who always know what they are doing.
This is a consequence of extended rule by a single party. The Conservative
revolution initiated in 1979 by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher was a
natural, necessary response to the Labour and trade union excesses of the
late 1970s, but it had completed most of its useful work by 1987. Victory in
the election of that year turned the heads of the politicians of the time.
Puffed-up and proud, they thought that they could do anything; blinded by
success, some of them imagined that Britain was greater than the continent
of which it is an offshore archipelago.
It is customary at this stage of what is becoming a familiar rehearsal of
recent events to say 'Europe destroyed so-and-so, and so-and-so'. This is
true, but only on the surface. Factors other than quarrels over Europe
played their part in curtailing the periods in office of the principal
cabinet ministers of the 1980s. Divisions over what was being demanded of
the United Kingdom by the European Community certainly existed. The late
Nicholas Ridley was obliged to resign following his outburst of anti-German
vituperation. Lord Lawson's chancellorship was blighted by his disagreement
with the prime minister over the shadowing of the D-Mark. Lord Howe resigned
over Lady Thatcher's anti-European rhetoric and, in an uncharacteristically
lethal burst of rhetoric of his own, brought down the lady herself soon
afterwards.
Historians may take a broader view. Europe has usually been the proximate
cause, but it is a constant. It has been a divisive force in British
politics for 40 years. Its power to destroy waxes and wanes, influenced in
part by what is happening on the continent, in part by the state of our
island polity, and in part by the skill with which it is handled. Europe
nearly destroyed the Labour party under Lord Wilson, and probably completed
the job under Mr Michael Foot. Sir Edward Heath has still not been forgiven
by the unrepentant xenophobes of his own party for heading the Conservative
government that secured Britain's membership of the then European common
market.
Yet it was not Europe, but his own decision to resign that ended Lord
Wilson's career, and it was the coalminers who toppled Sir Edward. It is at
least arguable that Lady Thatcher brought her downfall on herself by
persisting with the poll tax; without that issue, she might have survived
Europe. If Mr Major falls, the divisions within his party over ratification
of the Maastricht treaty will be only one element in the explanation. The
harsher truth is that, since his election last April, he has come to be
perceived - fairly or otherwise - as not up to his job. If he is sacked,
then that, not Europe, or his small majority, or the late start of the
recovery from recession, will be the explanation.
The negative effect on public opinion of internecine strife should not,
however, be underestimated. 'Damn your principles,' said Disraeli, 'stick to
your party.' When Conservatives heed this celebrated advice they usually
survive; when they ignore it, they lose. All Tories know this. Their famous
history is burned in their memories. As any schoolchild should be able to
remind us, they split over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. In
consequence, they became the natural party of opposition to the Liberals, a
fate from which they did not properly recover for the next 30 years. In
1904-05 they fell apart again, over tariff reform. Once again they paid the
penalty. At the 1906 general election they lost what had been a majority of
135, to face a Liberal majority of 129.
British voters expect their parties to be united. They cannot tolerate
division. In 1886 the Liberals broke up over Irish home rule; their unionist
faction joined the Conservatives, who held office for all but three of the
following 20 years. We have all seen what happened to the Labour party
following the departure of leading right-wingers and pro-Europeans to form
the now defunct Social Democratic party. The bar-room perception of the
Conservatives today is that they are led by a bunch of clowns, each
attempting to throw custard pie in the faces of the others.
Yesterday the lesser clowns turned and ran. It was not a question of damning
their principles, or sticking to their party. They chose, most of them, to
save their own skins, to stick to the seats in the Commons some of them
might have lost had Mr Major been forced to call an election. The spectacle
will not have enhanced the image of the Conservative party in the eyes of
the electorate.
You could make a case - the foreign secretary made it in the Commons
yesterday - to the effect that by the end of the summer all of the above
will seem like a distant memory. The pressure for European integration is at
least temporarily in abeyance; if the Belgian president of the EC tries to
push the federalist cause, a British prime minister can only benefit
politically if he slaps the perpetrator of such an impertinence around. The
exchange rate mechanism may collapse; fears voiced by Eurosceptics and
others that Britain would eventually enter a monetary union would be
stilled, at least for a few years. Meanwhile the government would promote
'British' strategies for the construction of the Europe of the next century
 -subsidiarity, an inter-governmental structure, enlargement, a reduction in
the bureaucratic aspirations of the Commission.
At the same time the economy really seems to be in recovery, if the recent
run of positive indicators is not again deceiving us. The government knows
what is required. Let people start feeling the jingle of disposable cash in
their pockets. Reduce the aching worry over who is next to be made
redundant, or who is unemployed. Stop the fall in house prices or, better
still, resume a period of increases. Address the pressing non-economic
problems on people's minds, most notably the perception that the Home Office
is not doing enough to combat crime. When all this is done, the argument
runs, Conservative voters will start returning to the fold.
I wonder. On paper the optimist's expectations outlined above could make
sense, but a lot depends on the ability of the government in general and the
prime minister in particular to find fresh sources of energy, new founts of
inspiration. For once an electorate has it in its head that an
administration is exhausted, devoid of new ideas, at the end of its natural
life the view that it is time for a change begins to take deep root. That is
why the Tories would benefit from a period of opposition, one in which they
can refresh both their intellectual well-springs and their leadership.
The other, lesser, option is to attempt renovation while still in office.
That is the curse of their victory yesterday. The gang of four who run the
cabinet will be of varying utility in any rejuvenatory endeavour. The most
outstanding, Mr Douglas Hurd, is nearing the end of his span as foreign
secretary. He is the only one of the four who could reasonably expect to
reach so high an office in an A-grade ministry. He may be around at the next
election, but few expect him to be in office after that.
The newest, Mr Michael Howard, has yet to prove himself as home secretary.
He is clever, but he does not inspire confidence, even among the
right-wingers who like what they fancy are his opinions. We know now what
the prime minister is made of; he showed yesterday that he has the courage
to risk everything, at least when the alternative is to lose everything.
Perhaps fate will assist him to develop that side of his character. The
ablest politician of the four is the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. If
political skill were all, the party could recover some support under his
leadership. If Mr Major does not engender a political recovery, Mr Clarke's
moment will come.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Lines of defence keep falling: Peter Norman examines the
latest troubles afflicting the franc in the crisis-prone ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crisis tends to be an overworked word in the European Monetary System.
But there is little doubt that the past week's turmoil, centred on a flight
from the French franc in Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system, has
richly deserved the description.
Massive central bank intervention on Thursday - estimated at up to DM15bn
(Pounds 5.8bn) on the part of the Bundesbank alone - failed to give the
franc more than fleeting support in the European exchange rate mechanism.
By yesterday, the German and French authorities had resorted to their second
line of defence to keep the franc from falling to its Ffr3.4305 floor
against the D-mark. They produced a joint statement of support for the
franc's current EMS parity while the Bank of France pushed up its 24-hour
lending rate to 10 per cent from 7.75 per cent.
After a morning of more turmoil - made all the more confusing by the
backwash of the political crisis in Britain and signs of new trade tensions
between the US and Japan - it was difficult yesterday to find anybody
willing to say that the franc was out of the woods.
Europe's latest monetary troubles have shown the ERM at its worst. France is
in recession. As the graph shows, it is suffering from sharply rising
unemployment. Its inflation rate is low, with figures yesterday showing a
0.1 per cent drop in consumer prices in June and a year-on-year increase of
only 1.9 per cent. And yet the French authorities have been forced to push
their interest rates decisively above German levels when the nation needs
lower rates to cut unemployment.
Germany is also in recession. But unlike France it has an inflation problem.
Its money supply, up an annual 7.1 per cent in June, is growing faster than
the Bundesbank's 4.6 to 6.5 per cent target range. Regional cost of living
figures for July, due soon, are expected to show year-on-year inflation
accelerating from June's 4.2 per cent rate. And yet the Bundesbank is coming
under growing pressure from financial markets to cut its key discount rate
from 6.75 per cent by half or even a full percentage point.
The ERM's latest problems have not been confined to the French and German
currencies. The Danish krone has been subject to speculative pressures
similar to those suffered by the French franc, with the Danish authorities
forced to raise rates in its defence. Yesterday Belgium also tightened
credit conditions, with the Belgian national bank pushing its central rate
up to 7.15 per cent from 6.7 per cent and its emergency lending rate to 10
per cent from 8.5 per cent. Outside the ERM's 'hard core', both the Spanish
peseta and Portuguese escudo tumbled precipitately on Thursday as rumours of
an early ERM realignment swept the foreign exchange markets.
The crisis-prone nature of the ERM stands in marked contrast to its orginal
goal of creating 'a zone of monetary stability in Europe' when it was
launched in March 1979. Its present instability is causing a tightening of
monetary conditions in countries that are struggling either with slow growth
or recession. Since last September, when it was wracked by the crisis that
culminated in the departure of the British pound and Italian lira from the
system, the ERM has increasingly become an engine of speculation.
The disappearance of exchange controls in Europe and the ever-growing
interaction between the markets for foreign exchange, money, bonds and their
derivative products have given astute operators scope to move funds on a
massive scale from one market to another. They can speculate in the hope of
large gains from an ERM realignment or collapse of the system at the risk of
comparatively small losses. Central bank reserves offer only limited
protection against such forces and can be swiftly depleted. For example, in
the week to July 15 when speculation against the franc was modest compared
with week, the Bank of France's official net reserves fell Ffr17.81bn or
more than 10 per cent to an estimated Ffr137.16bn.
Some observers believe that the latest crisis facing the ERM could be bigger
than that of January and February, when the franc faced and withstood
speculative attack, and even the generalised ERM crisis of last September.
According to Mr Paul Chertkow, the London-based chief currency strategist of
UBS, the Swiss banking group, it is ominous that the speculative pressure in
the system has grown without any political event, such as last September's
French referendum on Maastricht, acting as a catalyst.
The pressure on the ERM may yet grow in intensity because some of the big
players of last September have yet to join the fray. Although there were
reports late this week that conservative pension funds were pulling out of
the French bond market and moving into German government paper, there has
been no sign yet of a decisive attack on the weak ERM currencies by the New
York-based hedge funds, which last autumn toppled sterling.
At the same time, however, France's ability to withstand speculative selling
of the franc through higher interest rates has declined. In earlier crises,
France's banking system could protect clients from the worst effects of the
higher interest rates. It is thought that this is less true today, after
recession and a depressed property market have cut into the banks' capital.
So far, the consensus in France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium has
been strongly in favour of the EMS. But business people on the continent are
becoming aware that there is an alternative.
Britain's recovery since leaving the ERM was highlighted yesterday by gross
domestic product figures showing growth of 0.5 per cent between the first
and second quarters of this year. Over the past fortnight, the UK has
reported the strongest monthly increase in manufacturing output for four
years, a fifth successive monthly fall in unemployment, robust retail sales
growth and the fastest growth in manufacturing productivity in more than six
years. Inflation in the UK has remained subdued. Indeed, despite
devaluation, unit wage costs in UK manufacturing have just recorded their
largest fall since records began in 1970 and are falling faster than in any
other member of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries.
While economic logic might point increasingly in the direction of a
departure of the franc from the ERM, political considerations point the
other way. Mr Edouard Balladur, has threatened to resign if the franc is
devalued. The franc fort remains crucial to the government's policy of
binding Germany into a more integrated Europe and pressing ahead towards the
the Maastricht treaty goals of economic and monetary union.
And there is, indeed, a rosy scenario in which the foreign exchange market
travails of the past weeks would quickly be forgotten. If the Bundesbank can
be persuaded to ease its credit policy, France and the other embattled ERM
members should be able to lower their rates and return to growth, building
on their success in reducing inflation.
In some respects the scenario is not so far fetched. Figures this week
showed that French manufacturing output rose 0.2 per cent in May while
Insee, France's official statistics organisation, has forecast stable GDP in
the third quarter and a small gain towards the end of the year.
However, the Bundesbank seems unlikely to oblige with a rate cut soon
enough. Its decision-making central council meets for the last time before
its summer break next Thursday. Yesterday, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, one of
Germany's regional central bankers who is also a council member, said a cut
in German interest rates was 'not on the cards' because of high inflation
and excessive government borrowing. Analysts agree that financial markets
will keep the ERM under strain in the absence of a German rate cut. The
longer the pressure keeps up, the more likely the system is to buckle.
The traditional response to such acute crisis in the ERM has been
realignment of currency parities. But political conditions in France make
this especially difficult.
Restoring exchange controls is a theoretical possibility but is extremely
unlikely because of practical problems and the huge damage that it would
inflict on the EC's internal market.
On Thursday, rumours swept the market that the EC would decide wider
fluctuation margins than the current 2.25 per cent either side of bilateral
central rates for the D-mark, French franc, Danish krone, Dutch guilder,
Belgian franc and Irish punt. They could be widened to the 6 per cent
margins used by the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo or further. But
such a move would represent a profound setback for the system and might
prove no more than a short-term palliative if the weak currencies were
pushed quickly to their new limits.
If pressure intensifies, market analysts in London believe that there may be
no alternative but to suspend the system until economic conditions in France
and Germany come more into line.
Such an action would be drastic and there is no sign of politicial support
for such an idea on either side of the Rhine. But the EMS since German union
at the end of the 1980s has been hallmarked by the failure of the system's
political masters to react in time to events. Developments this week suggest
that, in this respect, nothing has changed.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's last gambit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE END the power of a prime minister is the power of dissolution. By
making the Tory rebels choose between the Maastricht treaty and the likely
extinction not just of the government, but perhaps of their party, Mr Major
has played for the highest possible stakes and won. Some argue, wrongly,
that this will prove a Pyrrhic victory. True, it has been costly, but it is
still far better than a defeat. Yesterday's vote keeps the UK where it
should be, inside the European Community.
Mr Major has made many mistakes: mistakes over the ERM, over the economy,
over political management and over this treaty. For all that, he was right
on the essential point. The UK has no future isolated from the powerful
economies to its east. Naturally, it has its own traditions, interests and
ideas, which are often difficult to reconcile with those of its closest
neighbours. But the UK is either in Europe or in limbo. Mr Major understands
this. To his credit, he obtained a treaty his party could just about live
with and will now be able to ratify what he obtained. His tactics may often
have been inept, but the strategy has been correct.
The extent of the difficulties the prime minister has faced must also be
acknowledged. There is a majority in parliament, however unenthusiastic a
majority, for ratification of the treaty. But, as became obvious on
Thursday, offered a choice between a treaty without the social chapter and
one with it, many Tories who hoped for no treaty at all would vote for the
latter option, so depriving the government of its majority.
Steep price
By turning the question into one of confidence, Mr Major took this option
away from the rebels. But the political price he has had to pay is a steep
one. Many in his party are embittered by what the prime minister has done,
although he will be encouraged that none pushed rebellion to the point of
losing the whip and so further reducing his majority. That majority and Mr
Major's authority are likely to be further diminished by the Christchurch
bye-election. More damage may yet be done by whatever emerges about his
discussions with the official Unionists. But at least Mr Major can now focus
public attention upon matters other than the tortuous tedium of Maastricht.
He can also enjoy the fact that he has come out of this battle better than
has Mr Smith, a man who has seemed willing to play fast and loose with his
Euro-enthusiast principles. Mr Major may not be a brilliant politician. But
he has at least proved a dogged one.
The Maastricht treaty is now ratified in the UK, unless, as is most
improbable, Lord Rees Mogg's suit against it succeeds. The only remaining
obstacle is then the German constitutional court. In all probability, the
European Union will soon be born. What might that mean, not just for the EC
but also for the UK?
Not for many years has the likely future development of the EC been more
obscure: the Maastricht treaty has been ratified, but with great difficulty;
the ERM, the foundation stone of economic and monetary union, is shaking
once again; the parity of the French franc against the D-Mark is under
pressure; economic and monetary union looks no more than a distant hope; the
European economy is in recession; unemployment appears an intractable threat
to social stability; and, last but not least, dreams of foreign policy
co-operation are daily belied by the carnage in Bosnia.
Immensely risky
Faced with this crisis, the central players, Germany and France, may embark
on a determined move towards greater integration. Such a response would be
far from unprecedented. But it would be an immensely risky course, since it
might well fail to win support even in those countries. It would certainly
shatter any hopes for peace in the Tory party. It might also disrupt the
Labour party. For the moment at least, Maastricht seems as far as the UK is
able to go. It is certainly as far as the Conservative party can go.
Alternatively, scarred by recent failures, continental politicians may
concede the wisdom of a different agenda, one based on enlargement and
economic deregulation. If so, the UK would be able to play a more central
role than hitherto. It need not be in a permanent minority of one, but may
be able to be a helpful participant in the reformulation of Europe's future.
But that development, however helpful to the Conservatives, would be
disturbing to the Labour party, which has come to embrace the EC largely
because of its social programme.
Nobody knows how the game will now be played, either in the EC or in the UK.
The divisions inside British political parties are at least as deep as over
any previous issue. But this is hardly surprising, since the question of
Europe determines the kind of polity in which the political game is played.
The issue of Europe could still shatter British politics. But it need not
come to that. Much will depend on where Europe goes. A British prime
minister cannot determine the rules of the European game. But Mr Major has
at least kept the UK as a player. For that, he deserves credit.

FT  24 JUL 93 / High Court halts British Coal move to divert pension surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL'S plan to use its Pounds 481m half share of a staff pension
fund surplus to help finance redundancies was blocked by the High Court
yesterday.
Mr Justice Vinelott ruled that British Coal would have to pay funds into the
scheme to cover enhanced pensions for redundant workers and could not rely
on a portion of the scheme's surplus to cover its obligations instead.
In April the fund's trustees took legal advice that British Coal's plans to
withhold payment were barred by the scheme's rules.
Both parties sought a court ruling and two scheme members joined the case,
arguing that employers did not have the right to extract surpluses for their
own benefit.
The judge said the scheme forbade the employer from extracting cash from the
scheme for its own use. Failure to make an agreed payment to cover a
specific expense amounted to a cash withdrawal, he said.
But he stopped short of suggesting that employers were generally forbidden
from altering scheme rules for their own benefit.
Ms Angela Dimsdale-Gill, of solicitors Lovell White Durant which represented
the trustees, said the court specifically rejected one argument in the case
which could have set limits on employers' ability to extract surpluses from
schemes in other cases.
That argument, put by two scheme members, said it would be a violation of an
employer's fiduciary duty as a trustee to alter scheme rules for his own
benefit.
Ms Gill said the judge had drawn a distinction between a private trust and a
public trust fund, such as a pension scheme. Pension schemes were commercial
trusts and had to take commercial considerations into account, he said.
British Coal had agreed to pay the Pounds 481m into the scheme in staged
payments, and in April would have been required to make a Pounds 100m
contribution for the current year.
However, at the urging of government ministers it argued that because it is
entitled to use half of the existing surplus for its own benefit, its
portion of the surplus should be used to cover its contribution instead.
The surplus totalled more than Pounds 1bn at the scheme's last actuarial
valuation three years ago. A 1990 amendment to the scheme's rules said
surpluses should be split equally to benefit members and the employer.
British Coal has been enjoying its share of the surplus in the form of a
contributions holiday.
The six-figure legal costs will be paid from the pension fund.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Tax breaks for US film studios criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH media lawyer has criticised the big US film studios for extracting
large sums of money from the UK film market and paying very low levels of
tax.
Mr Michael Henry, of lawyers Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, has sent a report on
the industry to the National Heritage Department, the Treasury, the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Fair Trading. In it he
calls for action over what he sees as a distortion of the market.
Mr Henry argues that between 1988 and 1991, the six main US studios had a
turnover of Pounds 1.3bn in the UK but paid an average of 1.33 per cent tax
on profits and remitted royalties. The report says that the total UK tax
paid by United International Pictures was 0.5 per cent.
Mr Henry argues: 'It is my view that a direct causal link exists between the
parlous state of the UK production sector and the activities of the US
majors, whose combined market share exceeds 85 per cent of the UK market.'
The payment from the UK of royalties to overseas owners of intellectual
property rights is normally subject to the deduction of withholding tax  -
something that the film industry is exempt from.
'It is clearly in the public interest that action should be taken to remove
the imbalance in the market,' says Mr Henry, who would like the government
to reappraise the tax position of the UK subsidiaries of US film companies
and consider imposing a withholding tax on domestic remittances of
royalties.
Other possible courses of action, he suggests, would include a competition
investigation into the film industry or adoption of a scheme for voluntary
investment in the UK film sector.
The Motion Picture Association of America yesterday said its members paid
all the taxes they were liable for under British law and under the double
taxation agreement between the UK and the US.
The association also pointed out that a large proportion of the money in UK
film production was US money.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Holiday executives charged with fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO SENIOR executives of the Land Travel coach company, which collapsed a
year ago, have been charged with fraudulent trading, Avon and Somerset
Police said yesterday.
Mr Valere Tjolle, who was chairman of the Bath-based company, and Mrs
Theresa McDermott, who was company secretary, are to appear before Bath
magistrates on August 25. The police, who have been investigating the
company since its collapse in July last year, said the two were charged this
week after a fraud squad interview.
An estimated 40,000 holidaymakers were believed to have lost their money in
the collapse. Land Travel was not a member of the Association of British
Travel Agents and had not arranged a bond to protect customers' money.
Mr Tjolle bought the company from the Granada Group in 1990. At the time of
its collapse the company was offering three-day coach holidays in Paris or
Brussels for Pounds 49 and 10 days in Poland for Pounds 159. In the years
that Mr Tjolle owned the company it made heavy losses. In 1990-91 losses
were Pounds 1.8m and in 1991-92 they were Pounds 2.7m.
Land Travel's case led to warnings by the industry that further failures
were likely. European Community rules which came into effect at the start of
the year were aimed at ensuring that customers would not lose their money in
the event of collapse. Package travel companies now have to arrange bonding
or insurance on customers' behalf.
The effectiveness of the new regulations was put in doubt by the collapse
last May of SFV Holidays, a small Oxford-based company which was unbonded.
It emerged that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had told
the company that it did not need bonding because it allowed customers to
specify which ferry service they wished to use.

FT  24 JUL 93 / House price rise of 1% forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES are unlikely to rise by more than 1 per cent this year and
house sales are expected to be the second lowest since 1976, according to
stockbrokers UBS.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at the brokers, said the pace of
recovery had slowed since the spring with new instructions and 'net sales'
(excluding those that fell through) reported by estate agents falling
sharply since they peaked in March.
House prices rises of 3 per cent reported by the Halifax building society in
March and April subsequently fell by 2.3 per cent in May and June.
Mr Wriglesworth said he expected house sales in England and Wales to rise by
7 per cent to 1.2m this year.
Recovery in the housing market was forecast to accelerate next year with
prices rising by 7 per cent and transactions by 10 per cent.
UBS said a future boom in house prices was unlikely as attitudes towards
house purchases had changed. Nearly 2m people had seen the value of their
house fall below the value of their mortgage.
UBS said the number of people between 25 and 28, the age at which many buy
their first home, would fall sharply in the next 10 years, reducing the
potential pool of first-time buyers by 30 per cent.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Manufacturing fuels surge in growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBUST manufacturing output fuelled another strong rise in economic growth
in the second quarter, official figures showed yesterday.
Provisional estimates show that gross domestic product rose by 0.5 per cent
quarter-on-quarter, following a 0.4 per cent increase in the first three
months of the year. Compared with a year ago GDP was 1.5 per cent higher.
Excluding production of oil and gas, the economy grew by 0.5 per cent
compared with first-quarter figures after growing by 0.7 per cent in the
first quarter. This underlying measure of GDP was 1.3 per cent up on the
same period a year ago.
The figures suggest the economy is recovering more quickly and strongly than
was anticipated by both the Treasury and many economists.
The Central Statistical Office said strong manufacturing output was the
principal force behind the second-quarter rise.
Service-sector output was also estimated to have increased between April and
June, with banking and financial services acting as the main spur to growth.
The provisional figures show output of the service industries up a
seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent on the previous quarter and 1.5 per cent up
on a year ago.
Within this the distribution, hotels and catering sector - which includes
retailers and wholesalers - grew by 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter to stand
2 per cent up on a year ago.
The CSO said output from transport and communications industries had risen
but the public sector remained flat on the previous quarter.
Economists have been surprised at the growth in the first two quarters of
the year - particularly growth of non-oil GDP - but they have noted that the
economy is not recovering as quickly as it did from the last recession at
the start of the 1980s.
After the trough in the first quarter of 1981 GDP grew by 0.7 per cent, 0.8
per cent and 0.3 per cent for three successive quarters.
GDP then fell back by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 1982.
In the four quarters since the trough of this recession - the second quarter
of last year - output has risen by 0.3 per cent, 0.3 per cent, 0.4 per cent
and 0.5 per cent respectively.
Many economists have now improved their growth predictions for this year. Mr
Kevin Gardiner, of SG Warburg, said growth would reach 1.7 per cent this
year and 2.9 per cent in 1994. Mr Paul Turnbull, economist for Smith New
Court, forecast a rise in GDP of 2 per cent this year and 3.25 per cent next
year.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Cost to business of MMC probes examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday an-nounced that it was appointing consultants to
carry out a wide-ranging management review of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission - including a look at the costs to business of MMC inquiries.
Price Waterhouse, the management consultants, will carry out the review,
which will cost less than Pounds 100,000, the Department of Trade and
Industry said yesterday.
The review came amid continuing debate about the role and structure of the
UK competition authorities.
Industrialists have complained that there is too much duplication between
the MMC and the Office of Fair Trading, while consumer groups have said the
commission has 'gone soft' on companies it has investigated.
The commission said that it was routinely reviewed every five years. 'This
is not an unusual departure,' it added.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the review would cover
'all aspects of the financial management and organisation of the MMC'. It
would also reflect other issues of concern to ministers, particularly costs
to businesses.
The DTI said the costs of commission inquiries would be considered as a
matter of course by such a review, but even so the news was welcomed by
industry.
The Confederation of British Industry said: 'Major industry-wide inquiries
can cost millions.' When small and medium-sized enterprises were involved in
an inquiry their ability to handle day-to-day business could be 'seriously
impaired'.
The review will also evaluate the scope for a programme of market testing of
commission functions - looking at the efficiency of the commission and
whether it is giving value for money. The commission employs 110 people and
has an annual budget of Pounds 5m. It said yesterday that it always tried to
carry out its role with the least burden or cost to the parties involved. It
added that its reputation depended on the efficacy of its reports.
The last review of the commission was carried out internally in 1986. The
timing of the latest review takes account of the appointment of a new
chairman in April when Mr Graeme Odgers replaced Sir Sydney Lipworth.
Price Waterhouse was appointed after a competitive tender involving six
other companies. It is expected to begin work on August 4 and to report by
the beginning of October.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Life assurers hit back at Treasury plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies have reacted angrily to the Treasury's decision to make
life assurance sales agents disclose more information to customers.
Many insurance companies said consumers do not need or want to know details
of a sales agent's commission.
The Treasury, responding to recommendations from the Office of Fair Trading,
announced on Thursday that sales agents will have to tell prospective
policyholders how much commission they will receive. The new rules on
commission disclosure will apply to both independent financial advisers and
those who sell the products of a single provider.
The Treasury also ordered companies to tell prospective customers by how
much their charges are likely to reduce investment returns; how early
surrender would affect the value of a policy; and to allow low-cost sales
outlets to charge less for the same product than high-cost outlets.
With more than 80 per cent of all policies sold through direct or tied sales
agents, the Treasury's ruling will have a significant effect. Mr Tom King,
general marketing manager at Standard Life, said: 'The chancellor's
decisions are not what we were hoping for, especially in relation to
disclosure of commission and longer-term surrender values.'
Mr King said the difficulties of finding a common method of calculating
commissions to different types of sales agents would be too great to make
reasonable comparisons. 'That cannot be in anyone's interest, least of all
the consumer,' he said.
An eventual shift to so-called level commission - payments to sales agents
spread over the life of the policy - has been considered by many in the
industry for the past year.
Mr Peter Roberts, head of corporate affairs at Skandia Life, which sells
exclusively through independent financial advisers, said: 'There is no way a
sales agent can go out and show this big cash payout to the public and still
sell policies.'
Industry experts say that not only will the absolute level of commission
have to fall, but companies will be forced to abandon the 'front loading' of
commission payments that give immediate payouts to agents each time a new
policy is sold.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Cartography of distress redrawn: FT regional writers on
results of bids for assisted area status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GRINS of relief and groans of disappointment swept through town halls and
local economic development offices yesterday when Mr Tim Sainsbury, the
industry minister, announced the new assisted areas map.
The winners of assistance - those areas which the government says have the
worst unemployment problems - could now see companies in their areas
applying for subsidy under the Industrial Development Act 1982. The losers -
the Department of Trade and Industry received 2,000 submissions - will have
to find help from other government programmes.
The acknowledgement of employment difficulties in London and the south and
the removal of parts of Wales from the map has given a fresh twist to the
cartography of distress. Yet the shape of the map has a weary familiarity,
two generations after the first attempts to reduce regional economic
imbalances.
The first four areas designated by the 1934 Special Areas Act were
west-central Scotland, west Cumberland, north-east England and south Wales.
Many of these areas are still economically disadvantaged.
The growth of European Community spending through its structural funds has
meant that regional funding from Whitehall is relatively less important now
than in the 1930s or 1970s.
Earlier this week EC ministers agreed on a regional funds package which
would mean Pounds 2bn in assistance for the UK between 1994 and 1999.
Mr Sainsbury yesterday sought to separate domestic and EC policy. 'I would
emphasise that there is no direct connection between the assisted areas map
and the structural funds maps,' he said.
Local authorities do see a link. Mr Mark Hume, assistant director of
economic planning at Kent County Council, said: 'The DTI might say there is
no formal connection between regional assistance and European structural
funds, but you would have little chance of getting any money from Europe if
your own country does not support you.'
Mr Paul Bevan, economic development officer at Brighton District Council,
says: 'We regarded regional selective assistance as a necessary first step
to gaining help from Europe. Now we've been turned down our chances must be
very low.'
The criteria for the 1994-99 structural funds map have not yet been drawn
up, but in the past EC criteria have been more widely cast than those of the
DTI. The former have been concerned with broad issues such as rural
regeneration, the latter largely with employment. The EC has used varied
statistical material in making its assessments of aid-worthy areas,
including local gross domestic product figures. The DTI's basic tool is
unemployment figures.
There is a wide degree of overlap in the areas chosen for the two maps, but
exclusion from assisted areas status does not always mean an automatic bar
to the EC map.
Birmingham City Council pointed out a disparity in aid. Since 1984, when the
area was given intermediate status on the assisted areas map, it has
received Pounds 200m - Pounds 145m from the EC and Pounds 56m from UK
sources.
The disparity is not surprising since EC spending is frequently on costly
public infrastructure projects. UK regional spending, by contrast, is
demand-led by companies.
UK regional policy over the past 10 years has moved towards regenerating
areas of urban decline, so that regional spending under the Industrial
Development Act has become just another instrument alongside others such as
urban development corporations and enterprise zones.
Combined with constraints on government spending, a slowdown in inward
investment and corporate reluctance to expand during recession, UK regional
spending has been kept at modest levels.
Expenditure on regional selective assistance, the most important subsidy, in
England was Pounds 74m in fiscal 1991-92, an estimated Pounds 72m in 1992-93
and is expected to be about Pounds 89m in 1993-94.
The more modest UK spending is, the greater the interest in EC funding.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Workers' threat to Booker Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUSHROOM pickers dismissed from their jobs at Middlebrook Mushrooms, a
Booker subsidiary, are threatening to stage a protest at the company's
annual literary prize-giving.
The women are holding a rally today in Selby, North Yorkshire, at which
their union, the TGWU general union, will warn of a campaign intended to
embarrass Booker back to the negotiating table.
The 89 pickers were dismissed last November after imposing an overtime ban
after company moves to change working patterns to ensure reliability of
weekend production and reduce overtime costs.
Booker says the changes were needed because of revisions to delivery
schedules caused by Sunday trading by the supermarkets that Middlebrook
Mushrooms supplies.
On Monday, at a hearing in Leeds, the women will test whether they can take
their case to an industrial tribunal.
Booker said yesterday that the company considered the dispute finished, and
any demonstration at the October prize-giving at London's Guildhall was
unlikely in the light of the enhanced security measures in the City.

FT  24 JUL 93 / MoD publishes D-notice details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence yesterday published for the first time details of
the D-notice system of press and broadcasting self-censorship on security
matters.
The move was an early fulfilment of a pledge in last week's white paper on
open government.
The notices, issued by a committee of civil servants and media
representatives, give advice and guidance on the sort of information about
defence, intelligence and security matters which should not be published in
the interests of national security.
Publication of the notices came a week after Mrs Stella Rimington, head of
the security service, emerged from the shadows to face the cameras.
After a review, the eight current notices have been revised, reduced to six
and published. They are also to be renamed 'defence advisory notices' - or
DA-notices - to emphasise the nature of the system.
Publication of the six notices will disappoint conspiracy theorists, who are
prone to allege that 'they' will 'slap a D-notice' on a wide range of
fascinating information to keep the public in the dark.
The six DA-notices cover general matters such as:
Operations, plans and capabilities which could help a potential enemy.
Classified information on weapons, equipment and installations.
Details of government ciphers and secure communications.
The identities of members of the security and intelligence services, their
operations and methods.
Information which DA-notice 2 says should be withheld on non-nuclear weapons
and equipment is code names and numbers, design, performance figures,
numbers and areas of vulnerability.
The rationale given is that such details could enable potential enemies or
terrorists to improve their chances of success in an attack.
Detailed advice on implementing particular notices is offered by Rear
Admiral David Pulvertaft, secretary of the defence, press and broadcasting
advisory committee which issues them. he receives several requests a week
for guidance from newspaper editors or, more rarely, from TV and radio. He
sees his job as trying to help journalists to publish their stories without
damaging national security.
'Occasionally I have to ring an editor and say: 'I'm sorry that you
published that',' he said. 'When I explain why, they're usually very sorry
and say that they hadn't realised.'

but only 14 per cent of those who have suffered have told their managers,

The survey of 700 women found that less than half (49 per cent) of those
experiencing harassment had discussed it with others. Jokes and lewd
comments were said to be the most common forms of harassment.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Recognition that south also suffers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTS of London and coastal towns in the south of England are to receive
government aid after 10 years of lobbying by local authorities, MPs and
business groups.
It is official recognition that although the south-east remains the most
prosperous region of the UK pockets of it suffer from decline every bit as
severe as that in the worst areas of Wales, Scotland, the north and the
Midlands.
Towns and areas included in the new regional assistance map - in the first
revision by the Department of Trade and Industry since 1984 - have been able
to show they have persistent unemployment levels above the national average
because of structural rather than cyclical problems.
The Isle of Wight has had unemployment rates above the national average for
five years. Earlier this year the rate was 13.9 per cent compared with a
national figure of 10.7 per cent. This puts it in the worst 5 per cent for
unemployment of the 322 travel-to-work-areas in England, Scotland and Wales.
Clacton, in Essex, had an unemployment rate of 14.5 per cent last year.
Structural unemployment is the prime criterion used by the DTI for inclusion
in the map, but the areas have also been able to demonstrate peripherality
(poor rail and road communications), demographic imbalances of ageing or
young populations, poor future employment prospects, and inner-city decay
and deprivation.
A common thread, however, among the coastal towns is the long-term decline
of their main industry - tourism.
Hastings in East Sussex illustrates the point. Before the second world war
it was the third largest seaside resort in the country in terms of visitors.
It remained popular until the 1960s but the advent of package tours abroad
and the end of long-stay family holidays, combined with a failure to invest
in new facilities, caused a dramatic decline. Hastings still has many day
visitors, but the 'spend' of Pounds 60m is, in relative terms, a fraction of
what it was in the 1950s.
Attempts were made to offset job losses by attracting service companies and
manufacturing. But, hemmed in by the sea on one side and an area of
outstanding natural beauty on other flanks, there were few large sites
available.
Nothing more than branches of big companies were attracted. There have been
1,000 jobs lost in the past five years - from a workforce of less than
70,000.
Now the Hastings travel-to-work-area of 157,000 population has persistent
unemployment rates above the national average. In July last year when the
bid for assisted area status was submitted unemployment was 12.1 per cent
against the national average of less than 10 per cent.
Mr Roger Carrier, chief executive of Hastings Borough Council, said: 'We
want the assisted area status because it means recognition that we do need
help. Our economy is too fragile and narrowly based to be self-sustaining.
The assisted status could unlock the structural funds from Europe, which
means one of our major problems, peripherality, could be addressed.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Progress on Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel
group, yesterday welcomed the decision to grant a large part of east Kent
assisted area status, Andrew Taylor writes.
Sir Alastair is chairman of the East Kent Initiative, a partnership between
private companies, local authorities and enterprise agencies, which has been
lobbying for assistance to increase employment and competitiveness. He said
Thanet had the sixth-highest unemployment rate of all UK
travel-to-work-areas. Sittingbourne and Sheerness the sixteenth-highest.
Dover's unemployment was forecast to rise by 10,000 between 1991 and 1996 as
the ferry industry rationalised and the need for border controls decreased.
The Channel tunnel completion would also lead to job cuts.
Ministers had been convinced that the area needed assistance if it was to
compete with northern France, where large sums of state money have been
spent subsidising development and industry.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major left hanging on by Pyrrhic
victory - After months of bitter warfare, Tory MPs bowed to the threat of a
general election and gave the final go-ahead to the Maastricht treaty. But
there is renewed speculation about the prime minister's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIRED, anguished looks said it all. By taking his party to the brink of
self-destruction Mr John Major at last secured the vote of confidence it has
denied him almost from the moment of his general election victory.
But as Mr John Smith launched a savagely forensic attack on the prime
minister's leadership at the start of the Commons debate, the serried rows
of glum, grey ministerial faces exposed the depth of the government's
malaise.
The events of this week may prove to have broken Mr Major's premiership.
Keeping Britain in Europe may cost him his own political future. Certainly
many of his colleagues fear so.
In spite of the synthetic unity shown in yesterday's votes, the Conservative
party may also have lost the will to govern. It was hard for a dispassionate
observer of the bitterness and anger on display this week to reach any other
conclusion.
As the prospect of electoral suicide restored the appearance of discipline
on the party, there was a valiant attempt by senior ministers to preach the
message of a new beginning for the government.
After a year-long struggle, which has torn apart the government, the
Maastricht chapter had been closed. Even the leaders of the Euro-sceptic
camp were doubtful that the eccentric legal challenge to the treaty launched
by Lord Rees-Mogg will do more than enrich the lawyers.
The economy was growing much faster than the electorate yet realised.
Parliament's long summer recess would provide a refuge for the prime
minister while the political mood began to adjust gradually to the new
economic realities.
It was plausible stuff. Some sounded as though they believed it. Mr Major,
courting colleagues in a calculated appearance in the members dining room,
could not afford to admit otherwise. But by and large the public expressions
of confidence did not carry conviction. As one senior minister admitted in a
more private moment, yesterday's vote offered Mr Major a respite, not a
reprieve.
After the most tumultuous year in recent political history - on occasion it
has made even the last days of Thatcherism seem relatively calm - there are
no longer any certainties in British politics.
Mr Major's colleagues are unsure in their hearts whether he will survive the
next few months let alone the next few years. Some doubt whether their party
retains the will to sustain any Conservative prime minister in office. The
next general election will not now be on September 2, but it looks much more
likely to be held in 1994 or 1995 than in 1995 or 1996.
Mr Major's leadership is in crisis. It may be unfair - there are many who
believe that no leader could have rebuilt the tired and embittered party
which was Baroness Thatcher's legacy. But the word has got around that Mr
Major, nice though he is, is not up to the job. In fact, Mr Major is a more
tenacious, skilful political leader than he has ever been given credit for.
Not a Lady Thatcher - but then the Conservatives had had enough of
ideological heroism.
The problem is it does not matter whether the charge is true or false.
Conservative MPs hear it every time they visit their constituencies. They
repeat it in the bars and tearooms of Westminster. It is becoming part of
the received wisdom of the political establishment. It was there in the
eerie silence of Tory MPs when Mr Smith belittled Mr Major by lavishing
praise on the political skills of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Major will not again be able to threaten a general election. The
succession of crises over the past year have drained his authority. Another
crisis like that of this week would see the prime minister, not the
government, depart.
The threat comes from several directions. Ratification of the Maastricht
treaty has staunched the bleeding, but it has not healed the wounds over
Europe. Even as Tory party managers drove them into the Commons lobbies in
support of the government, the rebels were warning of fresh conflict ahead.
The next few months hold many traps for a prime minister. The looming defeat
in the Christchurch by-election on Thursday has been heavily discounted at
Westminster. Yet if the result turns out to be as bad as some ministers are
predicting it will take more than a few weeks for the shock waves to
dissipate.
The government should not underestimate its unpopularity in the country  -
and among the constituency party activists who are threatening already
another rough autumn conference for Mr Major.
The squeeze on public spending necessary in the November Budget - much
tighter than many Conservative MPs have yet appreciated - will create fresh
conflicts at Westminster. So too will even a whisper that Mr Clarke is
preparing to increases taxes.
Then there are the rebels. For many of them their enforced retreat yesterday
will simply fuel many resentments which have made them indifferent to the
fate of Mr Major's premiership. The preparations for next summer's European
elections will offer another opportunity for the sceptics to exercise the
power they now claim they have over Mr Major's policies.
There is talk already of a November challenge for the leadership if the
political atmosphere does not improve. The sceptics have no credible
alternative, but the aim would be to deliver the final blow to the prime
minister's authority.
Amid the talk of retribution and revenge swirling around Westminster there
were suggestions also that Mr Norman Lamont is biding his time. Still
burning with resentment over his dismissal as chancellor, he might choose to
fire another broadside from the fringe of the party conference.
Concluding yesterday's debate Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
offered an eloquent exposition of an altogether more optimistic outcome once
the frenzy of the past few weeks has subsided. Economic recovery would
gradually transform the political mood; the Conservative party would unite
behind a new domestic agenda; Europe would slip to the backburner. For a few
moments smiles replaced the scowls on the government benches - but in hope
as much as expectation.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sailor faces a lashing from whip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS PERHAPS appropriate that Mr Rupert Allason lists 'sailing close to the
wind' as his only Who's Who recreation. The Conservative MP for Torbay
appears to have been doing just that by being absent from yesterday's
Commons votes.
Mr Allason may find himself in hot water both with the government whips and
his constituency association as a result of his failure to appear.
One Tory loyalist said scathingly that the 'honourable member for Bermuda
North' had been summoned to see Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, on his
return. The remark reflected the widespread assumption that Mr Allason was
away in Bermuda.
The MP for Torbay since June 1987 now faces the threat of having the
Conservative whip withdrawn - which would isolate him from party activities
at Westminster and bar him from standing as an official Tory candidate at
the next general election.
In a statement released last night Mr Allason said: 'The dilemma I faced was
whether to keep the promise I made last year, not to assist in the passage
of the Maastricht treaty, or whether to back an administration that has
declared its intention to ignore the will of the Commons.
'It is quite clear from last night's vote the Maastricht Bill has been put
into limbo and the social chapter issue given the last rites. To insist on
pursuing ratification of the treaty is, in my judgment, absolute folly and
that is how I believe history will judge the issue.'
Squadron-leader Johnny Johnson, chairman of Mr Allason's constituency
association, said his MP's absence was 'curious, disappointing and as far as
I am concerned anger-making'. He had tried to call Mr Allason in London
before being passed information implying that he was 'in his Bermuda home'.
He said Mr Allason was neither popular nor unpopular with the association.
It was 'unlikely at this time' that moves might be taken to deselect him
'for political reasons'.
Mr Allason held Torbay at the last general election with a majority of 5,787
over the Liberal Democrats.
No Maastricht enthusiast, Mr Allason frequently decided against voting in
accordance with whips' instructions during the tortuous committee stage. He
is arguably better known to the public at large as the spy-writer Nigel
West.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-sceptics respond to calls
for unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-rebels responded to appeals for party unity in the Commons
yesterday to ensure a majority of 40 (339-299) for the vote of confidence
demanded by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, forecast that the vote, which
cleared the way for the ratification of the Maastricht treaty without the
controversial social chapter, would prove to be a 'turning point' for the
government.
A Labour amendment calling for the acceptance of the social chapter was
defeated by a majority of 38 (339-301).
Mr Major, when he opened the debate, repeatedly warned the Tory Euro-rebels
 -who just over 12 hours earlier had joined with opposition MPs to inflict a
humiliating defeat on the government - that their continued defection would
result in a general election.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, bluntly told the prime minister that his
'credibility and authority' had been destroyed on Thursday night when MPs
refused to endorse the government's decision to opt out of the treaty's
social chapter.
Mr Smith said the flawed arguments against the social chapter had been
abandoned as the prime minister, with his back to the wall, had been forced
to 'threaten his own party with electoral suicide'.
Government supporters reacted angrily when a shout of 'this is
assassination' came from the Labour benches as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, intervened to support the prime minister's argument that the
social chapter would increase unemployment.
Ministers joined in the protests when Mr Smith indicated that he, too,
viewed Mr Clarke as Mr Major's most likely successor, and added that the
chancellor had spoken with more confidence than the prime minister.
Mr Major insisted that the 'stalemate' caused by the block on ratification
of the Maastricht treaty imposed by the government's defeat could not be
allowed to continue.
He emphasised the backing accorded by leading industrialists - including Sir
Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries  - to the
government's view that the social chapter would add to company costs and
cause job losses. Mr Major warned that having to comply with the social
chapter would put at risk the 'significant sustained growth with low
inflation' now in prospect.
Mr Tony Marlow, MP for Northampton North and a leading Tory opponent of the
Maastricht treaty, contended that many businessmen believed that it would
result in them having to bear higher costs, whether or not Britain accepted
the social chapter.
The prime minister retorted that Mr Marlow was 'talking nonsense'.
Throughout the debate Labour MPs refused to accept that the government had
secured the support of the Ulster Unionists without entering into a 'deal'.
The prime minister assured the House: 'Nothing was asked for, nothing was
offered and nothing was given.'
Mr Smith said ordinary people could not understand why the government wanted
to deny them the social rights, social opportunities and social advantages
which were available to the other 11 members of the European Community.
He taunted the prime minister with having lost the argument over the social
chapter and of treating his party in a way which must have made Conservative
leaders 'turn in their graves'.
Mr Smith said Mr Major had threatened to press 'the self-destruct button' of
a general election in order to force Conservative MPs into the government
lobby at the end of the debate.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democtrat leader, questioned the Conservative
party's ability to continue governing. The party was 'so riven by civil war,
so infected by its own internal enmity, that frankly they cannot provide any
longer the effective united government that this country needs'.
Mr Ashdown accused Mr Major of 'ducking the issues'. The social chapter 'did
not have to come up now', he said. But the prime minister was now forced to
stake his own personal authority and the government's capacity to survive in
order to enable him to 'get his way'.
Clashing with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mr Ashdown denied the
Liberal Democrats were merely using Maastricht to embarrass the government.
Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford and another leading critic of the Maastricht
treaty, said he would vote for the confidence motion because if a general
election were to result in a Labour or Liberal Democrat government it would
be '10 times worse'.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Billericay slumbers on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILLERICAY Constitutional Club slumbered on as the four o'clock confidence
vote drew nearer, Rachel Johnson writes.
Pork chops with apple sauce, the day's very British special, had gone down a
treat and the two dozen or so Friday afternoon regulars had turned to
playing cribbage and watching cricket. Mrs Teresa Gorman's Essex Tories,
once branded Maggie's militant tendency, knew the outcome of the vote when
they saw Mr Bill Cash, one of the Euro-rebel leaders, throw in the towel on
the lunchtime news.
'It's over]' shouted Mrs Mandy Almond, vice-president of the Billericay
Conservative Association. 'Bill's supporting] There won't be a general
election]'
Mrs Gorman, who had earlier that day announced that Mr John Major's
confidence motion had 'got the party by its goolies', was saved. A fleeting
rumour that she had voted against the government was scotched.
Though the Billericay Tories fully supported Mrs Gorman's anti-Maastricht
campaign, they were against any vote that might have brought down the
government. And this from some of the staunchest anti-Europeans in the
party.
'I will take my objections to loss of sovereignty to the French and the
Germans to my deathbed,' said Mr Ronald Turner, association president.
'Sometimes Teresa uses unladylike language but her sentiments are true,' he
added. 'She's very popular here, very bubbly.'
Billericay is the sort of place where Tories do not hesitate to describe
themselves as very - if not extremely - right wing. The last thing they want
is a general election at a time when the Conservative party is tearing
itself apart.
Vote won, it was back to cribbage and cricket. Mrs Gorman's loyalists were
relieved that their MP, and the government, were more secure. But the
bitterness over Maastricht remained as deep as ever. 'I'm not European. I'm
not even British. I'm English,' said Mr Bill Lee, a Tory councillor. 'And if
God had intended us to be part of Europe he wouldn't have put the Channel
where he did.'
At the Billericay Constitutional Club, Europe will be the cause of more
Friday afternoon indigestion in the years to come.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionists deal blow to Ulster
dialogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's under-standing with the Ulster Unionists appeared last
night to have dealt a severe blow to prospects of renewing an inter-party,
cross-border political dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland.
Repeated government denials that a deal had been struck to secure Unionist
support in Thursday night's critical Commons votes were greeted with
scepticism at Westminster. Mr Seamus Mallon, of the mainly nationalist SDLP,
said: 'I think the talks are dead.'
The Newry and Armagh MP added: 'If we go into future negotiations we will
need to be very clear whether we are dealing with the government or whether
we are dealing with the Conservative and Unionist party.'
The understanding itself appeared to consist of a vague undertaking by the
nine Ulster Unionist party MPs that they would look sympathetically at
supporting the government in times of greatest need. In return the
government would lend a sympathetic ear to their views on issues such as
setting up a Northern Ireland select committee and restoring accountable
democracy to Ulster.
One Unionist MP said privately that the understanding had been set up at a
meeting between Mr John Major and Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist
leader, earlier this month.
There was a hint in yesterday's Commons debate that a select committee might
indeed be a part of such an accord. This came when Sir Peter Emery, chairman
of the Commons procedure committee, reminded MPs that the body had
'recommended for some time that Northern Ireland should have a select
committee dealing with their affairs'.
Last night the Rev Martin Smyth, Unionist MP for South Belfast, said he
expected changes soon. 'We expect the prime minister to govern us properly.
Therefore we want a select committee in the very near future,' he said.
Publicly, Unionist MPs were attributing their support for the government to
a 'co-ordinated campaign' by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and the Dublin
government to promote Labour's ideas for joint British-Irish sovereignty for
the province.
Mr John Taylor, UUP MP for Strangford, said the possibility of the Unionists
voting with Labour was 'crumbling' more than a week ago.
Mr Hume yesterday described the Unionists' theory as 'balderdash', a view
echoed by Irish officials who insisted there was no 'hidden agenda'.
Irish officials said privately yesterday that they remained 'cautiously
sceptical' about Mr Major's denial. The circumstances surrounding the vote
had done 'nothing to help UK/Irish relations'.
One Irish official said: 'We don't like Northern Ireland being used as a
chip in a poker game at Westminster.'
The Irish embassy described as 'complete moonshine' suggestions that Irish
officials, the SDLP, and the Northern Ireland Office had in recent days been
in secret talks aimed at developing the idea of joint British-Irish
sovereignty over the province.
The Northern Ireland Office repeated Mr Major's denial of a deal and said it
still hoped for political progress in the province.
Meanwhile, the events appeared to have given fresh momentum to a whispering
campaign within the parliamentary Labour party against Mr Kevin McNamara,
its Northern Ireland spokesman.
One Labour front bencher said yesterday he would be 'surprised if Mr
McNamara stayed in the long term', adding: 'You cannot see him as a
secretary of state.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sideshow waits patiently for its
moment in the spotlight - David Butler samples the mood and opinions of the
people of Christchurch, the next jury to judge the prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTCHURCH knew yesterday that it was only a sideshow to Westminster.
But it showed, in its own quiet way, the national relief at the end - if it
is the end - of the Maastricht saga. Indifference rather than excitement
marked most reactions.
The politically active were, of course, entranced by Thursday night's drama
and yesterday's votes, but chance encounters revealed boredom and
disillusion.
'I don't know where Maastricht is,' complained a housewife. 'It's not
Europe, it's pensions that worries me,' said an oldster. 'I can't stand
these silly games in parliament,' was the barman's comment.
The parties in Christchurch tried to campaign seriously. Each brought in a
big gun. Virginia Bottomley came to support the Conservative candidate
Robert Hayward. She and he agreed, unconvincingly, that all was well and
that, once yesterday's business was out of the way, the electorate would
face the real issues and stay with their traditional Tory loyalty. Mrs
Bottomley tried vainly to persuade journalists, whose eyes were on the
parliamentary drama, that health care in Dorset was especially excellent.
Gordon Brown dutifully came to support Labour's hopeless campaign.
Thursday's events, especially the 'bribing' of the Ulster Unionists and the
wooing of Nicholas Winterton, provided a useful text. But even Mr Brown's
eloquence may not be enough to prevent Labour's 12 per cent vote in 1992
from being squeezed into a lost deposit.
For the Liberal Democrats Alex Carlile troubled the local party by
predicting a landslide. He had forgotten the new campaigning wisdom -
'always understate your expectations'.
But plainly everything in this, the 13th-safest Conservative seat, is going
the way of the Liberal Democrats. They have far more posters in front
gardens and far more helpers in the committee rooms and on the doorsteps.
Although they have had to build their organisation from scratch the result
is impressive and in Diana Maddock they have an adequate standard-bearer.
Christchurch is the epitome of a comfortable Tory seat with pleasant villas
and busy shops and a New Forest fringe. An afternoon canvassing with Robert
Hayward revealed a multitude of unopened doors as well as a handful of Tory
loyalists, a few civilised 'don't knows' and one Labour activist.
Mrs Maddock was making a significant haul of Tory and Labour deserters
willing to go public about their defection. A TV producer noted that Mr
Hayward had become reluctant to be filmed canvassing because the doorstep
reactions too often proved embarrassing.
It seems that the landslide threatening the Conservatives in Christchurch
owes little to Maastricht - but much to domestic issues and the sense of
government disarray.
Mr Major may have transformed the national situation by his well-whipped
success in the Commons yesterday persuading his rebels not to vote for an
early election. But, granted the phlegmatic, even indifferent attitudes
evidenced in Christchurch, it does not seem that yesterday's outcome in
Westminster will greatly affect the prospects for Thursday's by-election.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Why Sandinistas are killing Sandinistas: The economic
background to rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS after the electoral defeat of the left-wing Sandinista FSLN
party in Nicaragua, the changes brought about by President Violeta Chamorro
are becoming increasingly apparent.
The potholes in the roads are as bad as ever, but the streets are filled
with new American and Japanese cars, the capital has its first traffic
roundabout, and a new, gaudily-painted cathedral has appeared on a plot of
derelict land where cows once grazed.
But the question on many people's minds in Nicaragua this weekend, as the
country reflects on the recent confrontations between the army and left-wing
Sandinista rebels, is whether the centrist government of President Chamorro
can last until 1996, the end of its six-year term.
Last Wednesday, a rebel group seized the northern town of Estel and cut the
Pan-American highway. General Umberto Ortega, the Sandinista head of the
army, ordered his troops to crush the rebels, killing 41 of them and
capturing 104 more.
But the group which seized the town had not set out to topple the
government. Its demands were economic  - primarily drawing attention to the
alarming deterioration of economic conditions for the urban and rural poor
in a country struggling to recover from almost two decades of civil war.
The election of Mrs Chamorro in 1990, on a platform of peace, reconciliation
and prosperity, led to the disarming of 20,000 US-backed Contra rebels, the
demobilisation of 80 per cent of the armed forces, and the formation of what
was widely viewed as a transitional government.
The FSLN, which had ruled the country since 1979 after overthrowing the
dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, was allowed to keep control of the armed
forces under the leadership of Gen Ortega, the brother of the FSLN leader
Daniel Ortega.
This has been a simmering source of conflict both with the US and with Mrs
Chamorro's erstwhile political allies in the UNO coalition, which she headed
against the Sandinistas in the elections. Most of her UNO partners have now
opted to go into opposition, including her vice president, Dr Virgilio
Godoy, leaving her dependent on the support centrist parties and her
erstwhile foes, the Sandinistas.
The taps of US economic aid have only been opened grudgingly, to the
exasperation of her ministers, who have performed an economic miracle in
balancing the budget and stabilising the currency. But this has been
achieved only at the cost of drastically cutting social services set up by
the Sandinistas and sharply curtailing bank loans to small farmers and
businesses, with a resulting slump in agricultural and industrial output.
Unemployment is estimated to exceed 50 per cent of the workforce.
The attack on Estel was the boiling over of discontent which has been
simmering for more than a year. Around 1,500 rebels, in over 50 different
groups, are now estimated to be active in the north of the country. Most are
peasant farmers who have had extensive military training either in the
Sandinista army or in the Contra ranks. Some have found they now have a
common cause and operate together, while some groups are fighting one
another.
This week's government action was the swiftest and most violent military
action in the country since the 1980s. The difference is that Sandinistas
are now killing each other.
Gen Ortega has proved his constitutionalist credentials by standing firmly
behind the government, but the FSLN is deeply divided.
Many of its militants, and even some of its leaders, are sympathetic to the
rebels' demands, if not to their methods.
One wing of the party, backed by the trade unions and peasant farmers'
leaders, wants the FSLN to withdraw its parliamentary support for President
Chamorro's cabinet. Most of the UNO parties are already boycotting the
parliament, or voting against the government. Withdrawal of FSLN support for
the centrist coalition would paralyse the government and precipitate a
constitutional crisis.
If the political centre collapsed, only one institution capable of keeping
the extremes apart would remain  - the army under General Umberto Ortega.

<TEXT>
THE KENYAN government, under pressure to clean up its financial system, said
yesterday it had replaced the embattled central bank governor, Mr Eric
Cheruiyot Kotut, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
A statement from state house, the office of President Daniel arap Moi, said
Mr Kotut had resigned and was being replaced by a little-known accountant,
Mr Micah Cheserem.
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, said he had launched 'intensive
investigations' into the operations of the central bank, which has been
accused by opposition politicians of gross mismanagement of the economy.
The resignation is the latest in a series of developments in the troubled
banking system. Mr Mudavadi closed down the Exchange Bank, one of several
banks which are under investigation by the authorities, this week after
ordering an external audit into its operations.
Mr Mudavadi issued a statement saying he had found evidence of malpractice
and speculative activities. Exchange Bank has filed a court injunction
appealing against the closure.
'Its records are not in order and not kept up to date. Moreover, there is
evidence of malpractice,' Mr Mudavadi's statement said.
'Its management has tended to engage in speculative activities which are not
only inconsistent with established banking practices but are prejudicial to
the interests of depositors and the general public.'
Four other financial institutions, dubbed 'political banks' because of the
patronage they enjoy from high-ranking members of government, are also being
subjected to external audits at the request of the International Monetary
Fund.

Romania has failed to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund
for a new standby arrangement which would unlock Dollars 3bn of foreign
loans, Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
An IMF mission left Bucharest yesterday after two weeks of negotiations
failed to produce an agreement to replace the previous one which expired
last March. Mr Maxwell Watson, head of the mission, said the outstanding
issues were the need to restructure state-owned enterprises and to curb
inflation.
The country's failure to impose stricter financial discipline on state
companies, which have built up Dollars 2.4bn in inter-enterprise debt, is
seen as a major contribution to inflation. Inflation reached 225 per cent a
year in May.

unemployment compensation system, writes David Buchan in Paris.
Mr Michel Giraud, labour minister, said the deal, which will see a FFr4.6bn
a year cut in unemployment benefits 'settles the future' of the system,
which recession has pushed into a deficit of more than FFr30bn.
Under the terms of the rescue package, the state is for the first time

contributions, which will be increased under the terms of yesterday's deal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S security forces have closed down five newspapers, including one
owned by Mr Moshood Abiola, the unofficial winner in last month's elections,
which were annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida.
They also closed the local broadcasting corporation in Ogun state, Mr
Abiola's home state.
The closures follow comments by Mr Uche Chukwumerije, information minister,
that the government would not allow the recent barrage of criticisms in the
traditionally robust press to continue.
The military regime is under growing pressure to hand over to a
democratically elected civilian regime, but its attempt to re-run elections
before the scheduled handover on August 27 has been boycotted by Mr Abiola's
Social Democratic party, leaving only one party in the race.
Nigeria has a large and relatively unfettered private-sector press, mainly
based in Lagos. Since the law courts have been stripped of all power over
the handling of the transition programme, and with Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti and
two other leaders of the Campaign for Democracy detained in Abuja without
trial until September, the press is one of the few focal points for
opposition to the government.
The independent press has mainly reflected growing public belief that the
military regime has no intention of handing over power. However the most
influential and respected independent daily, the Guardian, is not affected
by the closure.
The most damaging reports have been in the weekly news magazines, which have
produced detailed analyses of the motives behind the stalling of the
transition programme and of the divisions within the military hierarchy.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Reform moves put squeeze on LDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading opposition parties yesterday moved closer to forcing the
Liberal Democratic party out of office by agreeing to political reform
proposals that would be the policy priority of a seven-party coalition
government.
The parties have yet to agree on the fine details of the co-operation but
generally accepted the introduction of one-seat constituencies and
proportional representation to replace the present scandal-prone, multi-seat
constituency system.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New party, proposed the new system
in tandem with the New Harbinger party, but also indicated that a coalition
government would need a coherent economic policy to deal with the present
downturn.
Four other parties  - Komeito, the Japan Renewal party, the Democratic
Socialist party, and the United Social Democratic party  - supported the
proposal, while the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party,
agreed, but needs formal approval from officials next week.
The parties must also agree on a candidate for prime minister, as a vote
will be taken during an extraordinary session of parliament early next
month. It appears that either Mr Hosokawa or Mr Tsutomu Hata, the JRP
leader, will be chosen as the representative, but the SDP, hit by a bitter
internal struggle, could still bring the coalition undone.
LDP officials plan to choose a prime ministerial candidate next Friday, but
the agreement among the opposition parties yesterday will make it more
difficult for the LDP to find a partner to ensure success in the
parliamentary vote.
The LDP won 223 seats in last Sunday's election, while the seven opposition
parties collected 243 and expect support from independents in the 511-seat
lower house. However, if the SDP pulled out, the coalition would have only
173 certain votes, and the LDP candidate would win.
Japan's need for political reform was highlighted again yesterday when
public prosecutors arrested another provincial governor suspected of
allegedly receiving Y30m (Pounds 186,000) in illegal donations from
construction companies.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Japan recovery doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan yesterday raised doubts about the country's economic
recovery, suggesting that the current downturn may be longer than expected,
partly because of the 'heightened risk aversion' of banks and businesses.
In a quarterly outlook published yesterday, the bank still forecast a
recovery during the second half of the fiscal year, ending next March, but
noted that the excesses of the 'bubble' era had made banks averse to risk,
while the yen's rise hurt business confidence.
The report was delivered as the yen appreciated sharply on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market, closing at Y106.55 to the dollar, up Y1.73. The Finance
Ministry said Tokyo wanted to consult other governments to co-ordinate
exchange rate policy and limit the yen's rise.
In listing economic uncertainties, the Bank of Japan pointed to the
possibility of yen appreciation encouraging an increase in foreign
investment by manufacturers wanting to cut costs. 'The current stagnant
investment in the assembly industry is a reflection of low profitability in
the industry, and the possibility that a further appreciation of the yen
could trigger a massive substitution of overseas investment for domestic
production cannot be ruled out,' it said.
Meanwhile, the Japan Chain Stores' Association said sales at member
retailers, covering more than 8,000 stores, slipped by 1.3 per cent in June
from the same month a year earlier, the 10th consecutive month of
year-on-year falls.
Japanese car output figures for the first half of the year indicate that
production from January to June fell 7.2 per cent from the same period last
year, a fifth consecutive half-year decline, Michiyo Nakamoto adds.
Car production in Japan slumped to 5.9m units in the six months to June,
falling below the 6m level for the first time in almost eight years,
according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.

<TEXT>
TRADE ministers from the US, Canada and Mexico will meet in Washington next
week to take final decisions on environmental and labour pacts to be
attached to the North American free trade agreement. Canada's chief
negotiator, Mr John Weekes, reported 'considerable progress' yesterday after
a week-long meeting of officials from the three countries in Ottawa.
A consolidated text with some remaining areas of disagreement is expected to
be submitted to the ministerial meeting, which starts on Thursday.
Nafta is due to be implemented on January 1, but the Clinton administration
in the US has said the pact will not be submitted to Congress until the two
side-agreements are finalised.
The prospects of Nafta being put into force as scheduled have brightened
markedly in recent weeks. The US administration is anxious to submit the
entire package to Congress before the recess which starts on August 6.
The administration is confident that congressional approval can proceed
despite a legal wrangle over whether a full assessment is required of
Nafta's environmental impact. A US court last month ruled that such an
assessment is necessary, but the Justice Department has appealed against the
ruling.
Mr Weekes said that enforcement of the proposed environmental pact remained
an issue, in particular Washington's demand for trade sanctions against
offenders.
Canada and Mexico consider the US demands to be an infringement on their
sovereignty, and are concerned at the risk that environmental disputes may
spur trade protectionism.
Mr Weekes declined to predict the outcome of next week's meeting. But he
said the negotiators tried to do some 'creative thinking' to facilitate the
task of the ministers.
Among the proposals floated recently has been a North American Environmental
Fund, which would finance anti-pollution projects and clean-ups, especially
along the US-Mexico border.

FT  24 JUL 93 / White House in search of budget votes: Gore says plans will
create 8m jobs in four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday stepped up its efforts to win votes for its budget
plan with a pledge that it would create 8m jobs during President Bill
Clinton's first four years in office.
'We have set the 8m figure as a benchmark and we'll be judged by that,' Vice
President Al Gore said yesterday as the administration published a
state-by-state breakdown of where it believes jobs will be created by the
budget plan.
Congressional negotiators have made headway this week in producing a
compromise budget bill that reconciles the differences between the House of
Representatives and the Senate over taxes and spending.
Negotiators agreed to Mr Clinton's proposal to raise the top rate of income
tax from 31 per cent to 36 per cent for incomes above Dollars 115,000
(Pounds 77,000) for single taxpayers, or Dollars 140,000 for married
couples, with an additional 10 per cent surtax on incomes above Dollars
250,000.
But they applied the new rates from March 1, edging slightly closer to the
House's wish to backdate them to the beginning of January than to the
Senate's proposal of July 1.
This will produce a little extra revenue to help meet the goal of trimming
the federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn over five years from its current
projected path. But the hard negotiations over the energy tax, one of the
core elements of Mr Clinton's original plan passed by the House but excised
from the Senate bill in favour of a more modest petrol tax, are yet to come.
The fight is expected to get tougher as August 6, the day Congress intends
to recess for the summer, approaches.
Mr Clinton has this week renewed his drive to build support for his
proposals both in Congress and in public opinion, with a round of meetings
on Capitol Hill and a series of TV and radio interviews across the country.
Yesterday, he said he had 'very positive feelings about the progress made'
by negotiators on the budget bill.
'There is not a serious alternative, and there is no question that the
failure to pass the budget would be a destabilising effect on the economy,'
he told reporters before flying to Arkansas to deliver the eulogy at the
funeral of Mr Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel and his
childhood friend, who apparently committed suicide this week.
Mr Gore reinforced the message, arguing on a morning television show that a
proposal to replace Mr Clinton's broad energy tax with an increase in petrol
taxes of around 7 cents a US gallon was necessary to tackle the budget
deficit.
'Less than a dollar a week is not a bad price when you look at what you get
in return - a deficit reduction package that reclaims our economic future,
has already brought interest rates down and allowed millions to refinance
their home mortgages,' he said.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Hyundai Motor compromise on pay accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Hyundai Motor yesterday approved, by a slim margin, a compromise
wage agreement that is likely to end action that has disrupted South Korea's
largest industrial group for 50 days.
Hyundai Motor is the largest of nine Hyundai companies that have been on
strike since early June. The other companies are expected to end their
disputes next week.
The wage pact followed an 11th-hour agreement reached after the government
ordered workers to suspend their strike and threatened to impose a
settlement.
The government has been angered by the long strike, which has caused almost
Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) in lost exports and Dollars 1.25bn in lost
production, when most other companies' workers have agreed to accept
moderate pay increases this year as part a programme to revitalise the
ailing economy.
The lukewarm response to the Hyundai Motor agreement, which was approved by
a bare majority of 50.09 per cent of the company's 29,500 workers, reflected
dissatisfaction that many of their demands were not achieved.
The Hyundai Motor workers, who are among the highest paid in South Korea,
were forced to accept the company's pay offer of a 4.7 per cent increase
instead of the 16.5 per cent they sought. In exchange, they received
increased fringe benefits, including longer holidays and housing subsidies
and other allowances.
The workers were also forced to drop proposals to increase their bargaining
position, including the introduction of a union shop and a greater say in
management and hiring policies though the Hyundai trade unions are among the
most militant in the country.  The government has also blamed Hyundai's
'authoritarian' management style for the persistent labour problems
affecting the group.
Mr Chun Song-won, president of Hyundai Motor, said he would try to improve

<TEXT>
US REPUBLICANS yesterday succeeded in delaying the Senate confirmation
hearing of Dr Joycelyn Elders, President Bill Clinton's nominee for
surgeon-general, who is under fire for her strong advocacy of birth control
help for teenagers.
Dr Elders had just finished her opening statement detailing her rise from
poverty to director of the Arkansas Health Department when Senator Don
Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, demanded the hearing be postponed. Under
Senate rules, any member can delay a hearing being held more than two hours
after the regular Senate session begins.
The nominee, a formidable black woman, has been targeted for attack on
several grounds: her strong support of sex education, her outspoken support
for abortion, and financial and ethical dealings in both her professional
and private life. The White House is standing firmly behind the nomination
after being criticised for having caved in too quickly to attack on other
nominations - particularly that of Ms Lani Guinier, another black woman,
named to the Justice Department.
Senators were expected to question her about a negligence suit against her
and other board members of the National Bank of Arkansas, which was
ultimately settled. There may be trouble about her husband's failure to pay
social security taxes for a nurse taking care of his elderly mother, and she
will be questioned about drawing a full-time Arkansas state salary while
working part-time for the federal government, during her transition to the
surgeon-general's job.
Meanwhile, another Clinton nominee, Mrs Ruth Bader Ginsburg, seemed on her
way to winning confirmation to the Supreme Court after enduring and mostly
parrying intense questioning for three days.

FT  24 JUL 93 / French lift rates to defend franc: Only action by the
Bundesbank can ease the pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday raised overnight borrowing rates from 7.75 per
cent to 10 per cent in an attempt to defend the franc against one of the
most serious attacks it has suffered within the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The move, which was followed by a strong joint statement by the French
central bank and the Bundesbank, pledging firm co-operation in monetary
policy, marked a significant escalation in measures to defend the French
currency.
Currency traders reported some easing in the strong selling pressure which
had forced the Bank of France and the Bundesbank to intervene heavily to
support the French currency on Thursday. But the franc remained weak. At
between 3.4100 and 3.4180, the franc it was still trading at just over 1.25
centimes above its ERM floor rate of 3.4305 to the D-Mark.
Economists in Paris said that the rise in interest rates showed the French
government had sent a clear signal that it was determined to fight to
maintain the franc/D-Mark parity, even if this meant suffering higher
interest rates during a recession. But they added that higher interest rates
were not a long term solution to the problems facing the french currency.
'This isn't like the previous franc crises in January and September last
year,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris.
'The fact that the French economy is in recession means that it is much
harder to convince investors and speculators that a protracted period of
high interest rates is plausible.'
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that speculation against
the franc would be ended without the need to change other lending rates.
'It will be stifled without touching other leading rates on which our
economy depends,' he said in a statement to Le Monde newspaper. He said he
was 'convinced that those who have cast doubt in people's minds about our
determination to defend the franc will end up paying for it.' But economists
said that if short term interest rates were maintained at their new level
for more than a few weeks, or even increased, to defend the franc, pressures
will mount on longer term borrowings.
French banks, already suffering from exposure to company failures and
depressed real estate markets, would find it difficult to resist rais-ing
base rates, currently at about 8.4 per cent.
One French banker said that there would be a delay of several weeks before
higher short term rates forced a rise in base rates.
He cited the last serious assault against the franc in January when banks
kept base rates at 10 per cent, under the central bank rate of 12 per cent
and despite a rise in short term rates to about 13 per cent.
French politicians voiced strong support for the existing parity and
rejected a devaluation of the French franc. 'No example in the world shows
that, over the medium term, these artificial devaluations get you anywhere,'
said Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the National Assembly's finance
committee in a radio interview.
His comments reflected a consensus across the political spectrum in support
of the franc fort policy of Mr Edouard Balladur.
Currency analysts said that the next week would be critical in determining
the fate of the franc within the ERM.
'The best hope for the French authorities is a reduction in German interest
rates next week,' said one economist at a French bank. 'This would allow
French rates to come down again before the pressures from higher interest
rates start to mount.'
Without a reduction in German interest rates, analysts predicted the franc
would continue to come under attack.
An economist at a French investment bank said the French government could
then be forced into a choice between devaluation or withdrawal from the ERM
altogether. 'If they devalue, they will lose a great deal of credibility,'
he said.
'They might even be tempted to withdraw from the ERM in the expectation that
the economic fundamentals would support the value of the franc.'

FT  24 JUL 93 / Karadzic calls for Bosnian talks to be postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE future of the troubled Bosnian peace talks in Geneva was thrown into
further doubt last night after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
sent a letter to Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international
mediators, suggesting that the talks would be 'premature and
counter-productive'.
Mr Karadzic called the talks a 'pseudo-summit', questioning whether a
'Geneva meeting at this juncture could be called negotiations without
misusing the word'.
He said Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had 'no intention' of reaching a
settlement acceptable to Serbs and Croats, suggesting that talks be
postponed until mid-autumn.
'In their reply, the co-chairmen said they expected to see Dr Karadzic here
at the talks scheduled for noon tomorrow provided President Izetbegovic is
here,' said Mr John Mills, spokesman for the Geneva talks.
Earlier yesterday Lord Owen had warned that plans for the three-way division
of Bosnia would collapse by next week if Mr Izetbegovic did not attend the
peace talks in Geneva tomorrow.
In the face of military gains, Serb leaders may try to put off the talks
until they can force the capitulation of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army.
Serb forces currently control 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Lord Owen on Thursday postponed the final round of the peace talks because
of a Serb offensive around Sarajevo, which killed seven people and wounded
49 in the besieged capital, and Brcko, north eastern Bosnia.
Belgrade radio yesterday reported an upsurge of fighting around Brcko.
Bosnian radio said Serbs resumed their shelling of Sarajevo after it eased
overnight. Serb forces appeared to have halted their offensive on Mount
Igman, the capital's key defence point to the south west.
In Bosnia, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Lieutenant-General Ratko
Mladic, said yesterday that his forces were ready to observe a ceasefire
around Sarajevo by 10am tomorrow.
He told reporters after talks with the commander of UN troops in Bosnia,
General Francis Briquemont, that Moslem forces would also have to observe
the ceasefire.
Lord Owen painted a grim picture of the violent fate awaiting the Moslems if
they refused to endorse the republic's ethnic division.
'The fight for the Serb cause will then be handed over to General Mladic,
who with great relish will move his forces all over Bosnia-Hercegovina and
Krajina,' he said referring to the self-styled Serb state in Croatia.
Serb forces recently have advanced, raising fears that they are aiming for a
total defeat of the Bosnian army.
Meanwhile Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, yesterday again
snubbed Belgium's foreign minister Willy Claes, the EC president, who left
Belgrade without meeting the most powerful man in Serbia, who was reported
to be 'out of town'.
Reuter adds from Zagreb: Bosnia's growing class of new urban poor could form
the Balkan republic's next humanitarian crisis, a UN Protection Force
spokeswoman said yesterday. Ms Shannon Boyd said less privileged people in
towns and villages were having difficulty buying food because of sharply
rising prices.

ARMED with the L505bn (Pounds 211m) pay-off for his wife's stake in the
Ferruzzi family holding company, and deeply embittered by his experiences in
Italy, Mr Raul Gardini vowed in 1991 to leave the country for good.
Shortly before, he had clashed with members of the Ferruzzi family over
reorganising their holdings and lost a fight with the Italian government
over the Enimont chemicals joint venture. Having already built up Ferruzzi
into one of the world's leading agro-industrial concerns, Mr Gardini
determined to try his luck again.
In the two years before his death, he created the beginnings of a sizeable
group, spanning foods, commodities and trading. However, it still had to
gain the cohesion required to be a substantial force. Not surprisingly, his
activities were based on know-how and contacts accumulated building up
Ferruzzi.
He chose Paris as his base, and joined forces with Mr Jean-Marc Vernes,
founder and then-chairman of Beghin-Say, the sugar group in which Ferruzzi
was the controlling shareholder. Mr Gardini bought into Societe Centrale
d'Investissement, the cash-rich French company which was Mr Vernes's main
investment vehicle. SCI subsequently became the major shareholder in a new
Gardini-run investment concern, which in December 1991 paid FFr1.165bn
(Pounds 130m) for a 16.6 per cent stake in  - and three industrial units
from  - Sucres et Denrees (Sucden), the debt-laden French commodity trader.
The deal gave Mr Gardini and Mr Vernes control over Barry, Sucden's cocoa
bean processing subsidiary, the world market leader, along with Vital and
Sogeviandes, France's largest meat trading and processing businesses.
Subsequently, Mr Gardini reversed his decision to avoid Italy, and took over
a number of companies in the food and mineral water sectors.
Last July, Garma, another Gardini-contolled joint venture set up with a
leading industry practitioner, paid about Dollars 300m for control of the
popular Levissima mineral water brand.
Soon after came the purchase of four lesser brands, lifting the share of
Gardini-controlled companies to about 20 per cent of the big Italian market.
In February, Garma expanded further by taking a stake in a new joint venture
creating Italy's third largest frozen foods group.
Mr Gardini also showed he had not lost his taste for daring pre-emptive
strikes. Last October, he stunned the stockmarket with steady purchases of
shares in the state-owned SME foods group, which was set for privatisation.
The plan, according to dealers, was to launch a takeover bid, based on a
substantial minority stake, which would have frightened the then-Amato
government into ceding control. The attempt failed, but did nothing to dim
Mr Gardini's enthusiasm for getting back into the fight.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Commission confident ERM will hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday expressed guarded confidence in
Franco-German moves to defend the franc and hold together the exchange rate
mechanism.
EC officials said the goal of currency stability was vital to preserving the
single market. A decision to devalue the franc or allow the French currency
to float temporarily was not in the interest of either France or Germany.
Despite rumours throughout the day that the Community's monetary committee
might convene at the weekend, an EC official said last night there were no
plans to call an emergency meeting.
The latest attack on the franc comes amid a recognition in Brussels that the
Maastricht treaty's goal of economic and monetary union by January 1, 1997
risks being undermined by the deeper-than-expected recession, bloated budget
deficits, and continuing divergence among member states' economies.
Senior EC officials are loath to concede as much in public because it would
strip Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal and other weaker member states of
the political cover they need to take tough budget measures. But others
argue that the Commission risks losing credibility unless it 'comes clean'
on the Emu timetable.
Despite these internal doubts, Commission officials remain confident in the
Franco-German axis, arguing that France has no political alternative but to
maintain parity with the D-Mark. 'A decision to float would damage France in
a serious and lasting way in the financial and monetary field,' said one
official. 'It would also damage France as one of the two columns of European
construction.'
Earlier this year, EC diplomats said high-level Franco-German contacts took
place with a view to a future locking of exchange rates and a possible
exchange of observers on the boards of the Bundesbank and Bank of France.
This week, EC officials and Brussels diplomats speculated that plans for a
bold political move could be revived if Paris and Bonn calculated they could
not hold currency parity and the ERM was on the brink of imploding.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Obscurity to ignominy in a decade: The rise and fall of
buccaneering entrepreneur Raul Gardini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Raul Gardini will be remembered as emblematic of an era in Italian family
capitalism.
From the mid-1980s, he built up the Ferruzzi group from a highly profitable,
but limited, farm products and trading organisation into the country's
second biggest private sector company. In less than a decade, the previously
obscure Ferruzzi family, into which Mr Gardini married, became as familiar
to Italians as the Agnellis, Pirellis and other leading families of private
sector business.
Mr Gardini, dubbed 'Sir Raul' or 'the pirate' by the Italian press for his
swashbuckling business style, defied the financial establishment through a
string of daring takeovers, culminating in the 1986 acquisition of the
Montedison chemicals group.
By daring to seize Montedison, which had see-sawed between private and
public-sector control in the previous two decades, Mr Gardini cocked a snook
at both politicians who had grown accustomed to using the chemicals sector
as an important source of patronage, and Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese
merchant bank and Montedison shareholder.
Mr Gardini, 60, was born into a property-owning family from Ravenna on
Italy's northern Adriatic coast. In spite of his middle class roots, he was
a far cry from the normal members of the salotto buono - the good drawing
room of northern Italian capitalism from which Mediobanca traditionally drew
its support and which it liberally financed.
Mr Gardini's courage and breadth of vision often allowed him to succeed in
transactions from which more sober counterparts would have shied away. The
Montedison coup was followed by string of deals which took Ferruzzi into new
businesses ranging from pharmaceuticals to building materials and energy.
The group also expanded abroad, making Mr Gardini's face as familiar to
French, UK or US investors as that of Fiat's Mr Gianni Agnelli or Olivetti's
Mr Carlo De Benedetti.
Mr Gardini's rise was a reflection of the boom in Italy's equity markets in
the mid-1980s, when share prices surged and the prestige of financial
engineers rose high above their mechanical counterparts, on which so much of
Italy's wealth depends.
His success in mounting takeovers and asset stripping were partly helped by
the absence of rules, which have since been passed, governing compulsory
takeover bids and forbidding the sales of majority or large stakes in
companies at a premium.
Such business ethics did little to endear Mr Gardini to international
investors when transplanted abroad. Ferruzzi aroused suspicions in the City
of London for poor transparency and a cavalier approach in its attempted
takeover of British Sugar.
Mr Gardini's domineering business style, based on his forceful personality,
was buttressed by his wife's stake in the Serafino Ferruzzi family holding
company. After the founder died in a 1979 air crash and his son, Arturo,
showed a clear preference for the sidelines, the field was virtually clear
for Mr Gardini. Ferruzzi and Montedison became virtually a one man empire,
with Mr Gardini largely unhindered by independent-minded managers or
demanding outside shareholders, whose insight into the group was complicated
by the group's complex 'cascade' structure.
In some cases, that permitted decisiveness and fast decision-making which
left visiting bankers breathless. But in others, the concentration of power
led to excesses, such as Montedison's multi-million dollar challenge for the
Americas Cup yacht race or the brief appointment of Mr Gardini's young son
Ivan as chairman of Ferfin.
In the end, Mr Gardini's ambition and the lack of control led to his
downfall. Upset by the reluctance of other members of the Ferruzzi family to
back his plans to buy out the state's stake in the Enimont chemicals joint
venture, the final break with the Ferruzzis came when the family rebelled
against his plan to reorganise the family holding company to guarantee the
predominance of the Gardini branch.
Mr Gardini negotiated a L505bn (Pounds 211m) pay-off for his wife's share in
the family company, and used the funds as seed capital to set up a new
business empire. His death removes one of Italy's most exciting, if
mercurial businessmen, and eliminates one of the central players able to
shed light on the tormented affairs of Ferruzzi and its affiliates at a
crucial time in their history.

FT  24 JUL 93 / German rate cut unlikely, say bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS of cuts in German interest rates next week to help support the
French franc dimmed yesterday as a member of the Bundesbank council warned
that reductions could not be made 'at the drop of a hat'.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the central bank of North
Rhine-Westphalia, said he supported the means which France had mobilised to
defend the franc - yesterday's sharp rise in overnight lending rates. But he
indicated that he felt it was the wrong time for a reduction in German
rates.
Private economists suggested a cut large enough to help relieve the pressure
on the French franc - 1 percentage point - was unlikely, although some
believed a gesture was needed at next Thursday's central council meeting.
Mr Rainer Veit of Deutsche Bank said he could hardly imagine that the
Bundesbankers would simply pack up and go away for their traditional
four-week summer break without doing anything.
That might be seen as a sign they were not interested in the European
monetary system, according to Mr Gerhard Grebe of Bank Julius Bar.
Mr Jochimsen said on television that everything had to be done to maintain
faith in the stability of the D-Mark and Bundesbank policy.
June inflation of 4.2 per cent was unsatisfactory and July would not look
much better, while money supply was still expanding above target, he said.
July inflation figures, expected next week, are forecast to be unchanged or
even slightly up on the June rate.
Until this week many economists had expected a pre-holiday cut at next
Thursday's meeting as a sign that the bank was willing to offer a fillip to
help the German economy off the bottom of the recession and improve
confidence in economies elsewhere.
Central bank officials had encouraged the mood with cautiously up-beat
comments on money supply and inflation since the Bundesbank's last move
three weeks ago, when the discount and Lombard rates were reduced to 6.75
per cent and 8.25 per cent respectively.
However, the optimism all but evaporated this week when it was revealed that
money supply growth had accelerated further in June to a provisional
annualised rate of 7.1 per cent after 6.9 per cent in May.
The M3 measure is still being driven up by heavy state borrowing, and is
expected to be adversely affected in coming months as the effects of recent
interventions in support of the franc are felt.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Energy contract accepted by eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE partial privatisation of east Germany's electricity sector has been
brought a step nearer following the removal of the last remaining obstacle
to the Stromvertrag, or energy contract.
Boizenberg, a small town in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, has
decided to accept the Stromvertrag, signed in August 1990 between the then
two German states. It was the last of 164 local councils to hold out against
implementation.
The agreement ends a two-year-old battle by eastern councils to challenge
the contract, which in effect creates an energy monopoly in the five new
states. The acceptance of the Stromvertrag by eastern Germany's
municipalities will allow the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising
east German industry, to press ahead with the partial privatisation of the
region's 15 regional utilities. But the Treuhand's ability to use
privatisation to introduce more competition in eastern Germany's electricity
sector is restricted by the contract.
The Stromvertrag allows local councils to own 49 per cent of all eastern
Germany's regional utilities. The remaining 51 per cent is divided between
western Germany's eight utilities, which are currently negotiating the
purchase of that stake from the Treuhand.
The Stromvertrag also gave western Germany's eight utilities a 100 per cent
stake in Veag, east Germany's high voltage grid. Veag will be privatised by
the Treuhand later this year. The eight western utility companies have
insisted that the east's regional utilities must buy 70 per cent of their
power from Veag over the next 20 years in order to cover the large
investments. They are only free to generate 30 per cent of their local
energy needs.
Several councils challenged the monopolistic implications of the
Stromvertrag. Constitutionally, they argued they had a right to a full 100
per cent access to the assets of the regional utilities - or else
compensation - because they owned them until they were expropriated by the
east German communist state in 1952.
The compromise allows the councils to sell their 49 per cent stake in the
regional utilities in return for access to their assets. Other cities, and
then the eight west German utilities will have first option to obtain the
shares.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Spanish government believes peseta can ride out the storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE peseta yesterday traded just below its central parity in the European
exchange rate mechanism, reinforcing the Spanish government's belief that if
the ERM holds together the currency should be able to ride out the storm.
Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy and finance minister who took office last week
in a government reshuffle, said the peseta was resisting well the attacks on
the French franc and the Danish krone.
'I do not think that there are reasons for a fourth devaluation (of the
peseta),' Mr Solbes told El Pais yesterday.
The Bank of Spain took a similar bullish view at yesterday morning's
certificate repo tender. Confident that the peseta could defend itself
without recourse to interest rate rises, the central bank kept its key money
rate unchanged at 11 per cent.
By early afternoon the currency was trading at Pta80.20 against the D-Mark,
just over half a peseta down on the previous day's close. On Thursday the
peseta slid through its central parity of Pta79.11 against the D-Mark for
the first time since its 8 per cent devaluation on May 13 - its third
realignment within the ERM since September.
The peseta has a 6 per cent band within the ERM grid and it remains well off
its Pta84 floor.
'We're in the middle of the band. So what's the problem?' said Mr Jaime
Pinies, chief of research at Banco Santander de Negocios.
Analysts said that if the ERM overcame its present turmoil, there could be
renewed confidence in the peseta as the main features of Mr Solbes' economic
policy filtered through to the markets. In his interview the minister spoke
of budget austerity, case-by-case privatisations and a pact with unions to
cap salary increases.
'Speculators who are taking forward positions on the peseta are taking a big
risk,' said Mr Ignacio Montejo, chief economist at Madrid brokers FG.
Echoing a widely shared view that the currency's value was properly
corrected in the May devaluation, Mr Montejo said the peseta was 'cheap' as
soon as it fell below its central parity in the grid.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Companies in south now entitled to aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR REGIONAL STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in parts of London and on the east and south coasts of England are
to be entitled for the first time to financial assistance from the
Department of Trade and Industry.
To qualify for the help they must invest to create new jobs or safeguard
existing ones.
The move follows a redrawing of the Assisted Areas map, which outlines areas
where regional aid subsidies may be paid. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry
minister, yesterday announced the areas covered by the first new map since
1984.
The old map concentrated assistance on industrial areas north of a line
drawn from The Wash to the River Severn. The new map brings in districts of
high unemployment in London such as Park Royal and the Lea Valley and
selected coastal areas running from Skegness, through Great Yarmouth, the
Isle of Thanet and Hastings to Torbay.
Areas hurt by coal mine closures, such as Chesterfield and Mansfield, or by
defence cuts, such as Barrow-in-Furness, have also been included.
To keep the proportion of the population covered by the map down to 34-35
per cent, parts of south and north Wales have been removed. So too have
parts of Manchester, Bradford and Midland towns such as Corby, Kidderminster
and Telford.
Regional aid payments are made under the terms of the Industrial Development
Act 1982. Areas entitled to aid are split into development or intermediate
areas, denoting the extent of subsidy which can be paid. Regional selective
assistance, which cost the government Pounds 193m in 1991-92, is used as a
carrot to attract inward investment.
The shape of the new map reflects the changing pattern of unemployment in
Britain. Areas of southern England, hurt by recession and the shakeout in
the service sector, have recorded unemployment figures higher than those
areas in the Midlands and north associated with industrial decline.
The government's choice of areas was predictably controversial. 'Extensions
to the map should not have been paid for by cuts elsewhere,' said Mr Robin
Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary.
Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour MP for Darlington, which lost assisted status,
accused the government of gerrymandering the map 'to prop up crumbling Tory
support across the country'.
In Wales, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, tried to steer criticism away by
saying that the majority of the working population continues to have
Assisted Area status but Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, said
'the Welsh economy is too fragile to lose government aid of whatever type'.

FT  24 JUL 93 / France and Germany buy time in fight to boost franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday bought time in their battle to keep the French
franc in the European exchange rate mechanism but there was no sign of an
early end to the crisis in Europe's currency markets.
Intervention, verbal support and an increase in the French central bank's
overnight lending rate to 10 per cent from 7.75 per cent were used to keep
the franc from falling to its FFr3.4305 floor against the D-Mark.
Other recently embattled ERM currencies saw a similar easing of pressure.
The Spanish peseta closed slightly up and the Portuguese escudo held its
own.
But although the French currency closed at FFr3.416, a little stronger than
Thursday's close of FFr3.419, dealers and currency market analysts predicted
that the tensions would reappear next week in the run-up to a meeting on
Thursday of the Bundesbank's decision-making central council.
In late trading in New York the franc fell back slightly to around
FFr3.4177.
In a rerun of moves earlier this year to deter speculation, the French and
German governments and the two countries' central banks 'reaffirmed' that
the parity between the D-Mark and the franc was 'fully in line with economic
fundamentals'.
They also sold D-Marks for francs in line with a pledge to 'continue to
co-operate' according to the rules of the ERM, although on a smaller scale
than Thursday.
Their message was reinforced by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, who said in Morocco that there would be no franc devaluation.
However, currency market operators reacted with scepticism and insisted that
there would be no peace in the system unless the Bundesbank cut its interest
rates by as much as 1 percentage point next week.
'I would judge that about 65 per cent to 70 per cent of our corporate
customers and investors think that the ERM is beyond the point of no
return,' said Mr Rob Loewy, head of currencies at Midland Global Markets in
London.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Major's victory fails to end leadership doubts: Confidence
motion carried by 40 votes - Euro-rebels fall in line but threaten revenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S threat of a general election yesterday pulled the
Conservative party back from the brink of self-destruction as the House of
Commons finally gave its approval for ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
But the prime minister's easy victory in the confidence motion following
Thursday night's humiliating defeat over the treaty's social chapter failed
to remove the question mark over his premiership.
With Tory Eurosceptics threatening revenge after being forced to abandon
their rebellion and ministers acknowledging that Mr Major's authority had
suffered another blow, there was speculation about a leadership challenge in
the autumn.
Mr Major was joined by a phalanx of senior ministers in insisting that the
final parliamentary debate on the treaty  - only a legal challenge could
block ratification  - had drawn a line under the Tory civil war over Europe.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the government was at a turning
point and predicted a decisive change in the political mood of the country
after 'the last speech in the last debate on the ratification of
Maastricht'. In public, both sides in the Conservative battle stressed their
determination to put behind them the bitterness of the past year. After
talks with the rebels, Mr Hurd acknowledged the strength of their conviction
that the treaty would erode Britain's sovereignty, while Sir Marcus Fox, the
chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said there would be no
'witch-hunt'.
The prime minister, speaking after the government had secured a majority of
40 in the crucial confidence vote in favour of ratification of Maastricht
with Britain's social chapter opt-out, denied that his position remained in
peril.
Stressing that the government would now move on to a domestic political
agenda designed to sustain the economic recovery and step up the fight
against crime, Mr Major said: 'I don't expect a leadership challenge in the
autumn.'
Echoing Mr Hurd's comments, Mr Major continued: 'I think the line has been
drawn today . . . as far as the Conservative party is concerned the matter
(Maastricht) is done and gone.'
But his optimism was not echoed among the ranks of ministers and
Conservative MPs packing the Commons chamber for the first confidence debate
called by a government in recent political history.
Mr Bill Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic, said in a TV interview: 'The whole
question is going to continue because now people are going to have to see if
the landscape that Maastricht does represent can actually work.'
Senior ministers said they expected a crushing defeat for the Tories at the
hands of Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats in next Thursday's by-election
in the once impregnable stronghold of Christchurch.
They conceded their hopes the government would regain its balance rested on
the respite offered by the long parliamentary recess which begins next
Tuesday. At least one cabinet minister was ready to predict 'a very rough
autumn' unless the economic recovery gathers further pace.
But Mr Major's tactics in threatening a general election if the Maastricht
treaty were not ratified successfully forced the Tory sceptics to abandon
the alliance with the opposition parties which triggered the government's
earlier defeat.
With their arguments against Maastricht dismissed by Mr Major as 'nonsense',
the 23 rebels who had voted against the government on Thursday all reversed
their allegiances.
With the government retaining the support of the Ulster unionists, a Labour
amendment to the confidence motion demanding that the government embrace the
treaty's social provision was defeated by 339 to 301 votes.
The motion of confidence was then won by the government by 339 to 299 votes.
Only one Conservative MP, Mr Rupert Allason, did not vote after failing to
return in time from abroad.
The confidence debate, while something of an anti-climax, underlined the
determination of Mr John Smith, Labour leader, to focus his party's attacks
on Mr Major's leadership.
In a savage assault, Mr Smith said the prime minister's 'authority and
credibility' had been destroyed by his handling of the Maastricht
legislation and by his refusal to embrace the treaty's social provisions.

SAFRA Republic Holdings, the Geneva-based private banking group controlled
by Mr Edmond Safra, said its net income in the second quarter jumped 20 per
cent to Dollars 27.7m, or Dollars 1.56 per share.
Net income in the first half was up 20 per cent to Dollars 54.9m.
Net interest income soared 150 per cent to Dollars 42.4m in the period,
mainly due to margin improvements. Foreign exchange and other trading
revenues advanced 69 per cent to Dollars 7.1m. Commission income jumped 58
per cent to Dollars 12.8m, thanks to the growth in revenues from off-balance
sheet portfolio accounts.
Total assets reached Dollars 10.7bn at June 30, up 11.5 per cent year on
year, while shareholders' equity was Dollars 1.13bn or Dollars 63.82
compared with Dollars 1.11bn a year earlier.

TRADING in Sachsenmilch, the only eastern German company listed on the
Frankfurt stock exchange, was suspended yesterday following losses and large
cost overruns.
The dairy group, based in Dresden, whose majority shareholder is the bank
Sudmilch of Stuttgart, was listed on the exchange in 1991 in expectation
that investments of DM260m (Dollars 152.9m) would increase the market share
in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia.
The shares were issued at DM80, and suspended at DM60.
Deutsche Bank, the dairy's principal creditor, which prepared the company
for the listing, said the agricultural ministry of Saxony and Sudmilch, were
trying to assess the extent of the losses.

<TEXT>
CIMENTERIES CBR, the Belgian cement producer, has agreed to pay DM90.4m
(Dollars 52.50m) for stakes in two cement works in Poland. It will acquire
30 per cent of the Gorazdze works and a 42 per cent share in the Strzelce
Opolskie factory, which together produce one-quarter of Poland's cement
output.
CBR, which has sought to purchase Gorazdze for over two years, has also
promised to buy a further 21 per cent of the shares in the plant in 1997 as
well as 38 per cent of the equity in Strzelce, which uses the more costly
wet process technology, for DM55.2m.
The Belgian company has also promised to invest DM76m in new equipment for
Gorazdze and DM32m for equipment at Strzelce.
A further DM72m will be spent on upgrading marketing operations and DM11m on
reducing pollution.
The final stages of the negotiations were accompanied by a strike alert
called by the Solidarity trade union branch at Gorazdze, which has been
resisting a majority takeover by foreign capital.
It has also supported the Initiative Group (IG), an employee and management
bid to purchase the works backed by local banks and several western
investment funds.
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, yesterday afternoon
signed an undertaking for the union and the IG promising that 10 per cent of
the equity at Gorazdze would handed over free to the employees.
The remaining 30 per cent would be sold to the IG and the Polish Development
Bank, through the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

BANCO Comercial Portugues, one of Portugal's leading private banks,
yesterday reported first-half net profits of Es9.6bn (Dollars 58.1m), a 2.3
per cent increase on the first six months of last year.
The results reflected a 9 per cent increase in the second quarter after a
negative result of 2.9 per cent during the first three months of 1993.
Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP president, said the sustained growth in the
volume of remunerated assets supported by a broadening of the base of
depositors, a satisfactory evolution of commissions and the recuperation of
the bank's financial margin after the devaluation of the escudo all played a
positive role in the results.
The bank's cash flow reached Es27.7bn during the first six months of 1993,
up 9.2 per cent on the same period the previous year.
The contribution of subsidiary companies to the first-half results increased
to 22.4 per cent this year from 13.7 per cent of the total in the first six
months of 1992.
Net earnings per share reached Es88 during the first half of 1993. Return on
assets was 1.2 per cent and the net profitability of own capital was 12.3
per cent. The bank's financial margin rose to 4.7 per cent.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Rhone-Poulenc and BNP chosen to be sold first

<TEXT>
MR EDMOND Alphandery, the French economy minister, has confirmed that
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and Banque Nationale de Paris, will be
the first of the four state-owned groups selected for privatisation to be
sold.
The government was considering privatising Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, in
tranches, he was reported as saying in an interview published yesterday.
This was because of the size of the company. It has an estimated market
value of about FFr100bn (Dollars 17.2bn), and was the largest of the four
companies named in Wednesday's shortlist.
Banque Hervet, the smallest company on the list, with an estimated market
value of FFr1bn, is to be sold privately, the economy ministry said. Credit
Commercial de France, which has built up a 34.4 per cent stake in Banque
Hervet over the past year, is expected to take control through an agreed
purchase of shares.
Last year, Banque Hervet took provisions of about FFr250m to cover bad
loans, particularly in the property market. As a result, the bank suffered
losses of FFr186m. It has net assets of FFr24bn and 1,600 employees.
BNP, Rhone-Poulenc and Elf, the three principal companies in the first batch
of privatisations, will be privatised through a public offer. Mr Alphandery
described the companies as the jewels of the economy and said the shortlist
was the natural choice.
The economy minister said he was optimistic that the government would
achieve its target of FFr40bn of privatisation receipts by the end of the
year. 'The size of the market is not an obstacle because the Balladur bond
has already prepared the ground,' he said.
The Balladur bond, which was issued earlier this month and can be converted
into equity in privatised issues, has raised FFr110bn.
Mrs Pamela Harriman, US ambassador to Paris, has expressed concern about the
20 per cent limit on non-EC shareholdings of privatised companies.
Addressing a meeting of French and US businessmen earlier this week she
said: 'We would prefer to see no limit on such investments.'
However, investment analysts in Paris said that the limits on non-EC
investors would not necessarily be restrictive. 'Most big foreign
institutions have European operations which could buy shares in the French
companies,' said one analyst.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Thunderstorms threaten Mississippi states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ST LOUIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY thunderstorms swept through Missouri and Illinois yesterday morning,
putting new strains on the already waterlogged barriers holding back the
Mississippi and its swollen tributaries.
Weather forecasters predict five more inches of rain over the next three
days, and see no sign of a break in the weather system that has stubbornly
anchored itself over the Midwest.
The Mississippi reached a crest this week at 47 feet on the St Louis depth
gauge, nearly four feet higher than the previous record reached in 1973, but
five feet short of the top of the city's 11-mile long floodwall.
Hydrologists and weather forecasters believe that the river really has
crested, despite the continued rain, but they warn that it could take weeks
before it drops below flood stage.
'It looks like a three-tenths of a foot drop per day. We are now 17 feet
above flood stage so it could take six or seven weeks to get back down,'
said Mr Joe Schwenk of the Army Corps of Engineers in St Louis.
As the water moves steadily downstream, records are being set in towns as
far south as Cape Girardeau, but no more than slight flooding is expected
south of Cairo, Illinois, where the Mississippi is joined by the Ohio River.
Rainfall in the Ohio basin has been below normal this year.
For river users, this year's flooding has been not just higher but more
prolonged than in previous years.
'This is a flood which really started back in April,' said Mr J. Thomas
Dunn, general manager of Gateway Riverboat Cruises, the oldest excursion
boat company on the Mississippi.
High water in April stopped Gateway's operations for five weeks, and the
river never dropped much more than five feet below flood stage before rising
again at the end of June.
Mr David Lane, of Canal Barge Company in New Orleans, warns that even though
he has been told river traffic can resume at 38 feet, 8 feet above flood
stage, it will be a long time before operations get back to normal.
New shoals will have formed, navigation buoys will have been washed away,
and barges will probably have to travel at reduced speeds to avoid
endangering already weakened levees with their wakes.
'Waiting for it to come down is just the beginning of it,' says Mr Lane,
whose company has managed to divert traffic for one customer up the Ohio
River but has otherwise had to halt its operations on the river.
In normal times the Mississippi carries around 15 per cent of all freight in
the US, but an estimated 2,000 barges and 50 tugs are now tied up by the
flooding.

FT  23 JUL 93 / Ontario appeal for HIV tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ontario government has urged any of the province's 9m residents who had
a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985 to be tested for the HIV virus.
The warning stems from the growing number of cases which have come to light
of people who were infected with the virus before blood was screened closely
for it.
Mrs Ruth Grier, the province's health minister, estimated tests could
involve tens of thousands. The chief medical officer has written to all
doctors in the province.
Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children has identified at least five
HIV-positive cases since issuing a similar call earlier this year for
patients who received blood transfusions in the early 1980s. None of these
patients has so far developed Aids symptoms.
Canada began enforcing heat-treatment of blood products, which kills the HIV
virus, in November 1985. However, allegations have been made that the
government and the Red Cross, which collects blood donations, delayed the
heat-treatment regulations.
A Canadian television documentary claimed earlier this week that the Red
Cross continued to stock blood products that had not been heat-treated for
several months after warnings by the government that reliance on these
products 'cannot be justified'.
The federal government offered compensation packages of CDollars 120,000
(Dollars 94,000) in 1989 to any haemophiliac or hospital patient who
contracted HIV through a blood transfusion.
So far, about 940 people, including 266 blood-transfusion recipients, have
qualified for the payments. Any recipient is required to waive future legal
claims against the government. Several provinces have also agreed to pay
compensation.

FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING uncertainty over the outlook for equities again unsettled trading
in derivatives, causing the September contract on the FT-SE 100 to bounce
between a discount and a good premium to cash, Christine Buckley writes.
Market confusion was compounded by pre-Maastricht vote nerves as some
investors sought to steer clear of the uncertainty. Others, however, happily
waded into the trading quagmire to pick up bargains.
That toing and froing was a feature of afternoon trading when one investment
house played a strong role as a seller; another responded with active buying
and the independent traders formed a purchasing chorus.
The contract had opened at 2,824, a little ahead of its previous day's
close. It started on an upwards course and reached its high of the session -
at 2,828 - in the first half-hour. Its low of the day came in the early
afternoon before Wall Street opened when the contract dipped to 2,810.
The volume was down from the previous day's at 9,270, although the September
contract mustered a stronger showing against the cash market at the close of
2,828, 6 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash.
In traded options, stocks showed more active trade than in recent sessions,
with TSB, which broke off talks on one disposal but succeeded with another,
at the top, having seen 2,766 lots dealt.

FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firmer after nervous session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURMOIL in the ERM currencies came to the aid of a London stock market
otherwise overshadowed by uncertainty ahead of the UK parliamentary debate
on the Maastricht legislation, which continued long after the stock market
closed yesterday.
With UK government bonds rallying in late dealings as sterling advanced,
share prices edged higher at the end of an erratic trading session. However,
the six-point gain in the FT-SE 100 Index owed much to a rally in the oil
and pharmaceutical sectors, with the rest of the market lacking direction.
Dealers stressed that the market was lethargic for most of the session, and
that the big institutions were disinclined to trade ahead of the Maastricht
debate. Shares opened firmly, encouraged by a record close on the Dow
Industrial Average overnight, which was translated into gains in the
battered pharmaceutical sector and to a firm start in stock index futures.
But most share price gains served to attract immediate profit-taking and the
stock market soon reacted to initial weakness in the bond market. By early
afternoon, London, also discouraged by signs of a slow start on Wall Street,
was down by 2.2 to a Footsie reading of 2,811.9.
There were further signs that the institutions, while keeping a low profile,
were not averse to selling stock if they could. The day's Seaq volume rose
to 581.8m shares from Wednesday's 554m, when retail, or customer, business
remained high at Pounds 1.33bn.
The rally in the bond market provided the encouragement for a similar move
by equities. At the final reading, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 6.0 at
2,820.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a broader range of UK stocks,
recaptured an important benchmark to close 5.1 higher at 3,200.5 as interest
in second line stocks revived.
Sterling's firmness, which would not long ago have been seen as a prop for
cutting domestic interest rates, was regarded with mixed feelings in
equities, where this week's fresh evidence of recovery in the UK economy has
been seen as reducing the likelihood of an early rate cut.
'A further rise in sterling would weaken profits growth,' commented Marcus
Grubb at Salomon Brothers, rounding up the factors causing him to downgrade
his six-month target for the Footsie to 3,000. The other factors include a
bias towards fiscal tightening under the new chancellor of the exchequer,
poor corporate dividend growth and the weakness of Mr Major's government.
However, Mr Grubb is holding his 12-month Footsie target at 3,200.
The stock market's concern over the domestic politial scene now encompasses
not only the outcome of last night's crucial parliamentary debate but also
the challenge to Maastricht pending in the UK courts, and also the
like-lihood of a drubbing for the government at next week's by-election at
Christchurch, in Dorset.
Across the broad range of UK equities, the store and consumer sectors,
restrained by uncertainty over the outlook for profits, made only a modest
response to this week's indication that economic recovery continues to boost
spending in the high street. The brightest features came among the
international blue chips.

FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: TSB pull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of favourable and unfavourable news for banking group TSB led
to a two-way pull in the shares which brought volume of 4.2m by the close.
The stock was finally unchanged at 196p after tracing an erratic pattern.
The bank surprised the market by announcing that talks on setting up a joint
venture company with National &amp; Provincial Building Society to manage TSB's
estate agents business had been terminated. The company cited differences of
opinion between the two parties.
Mr Martin Green at Smith New Court said the calling off of talks with
National &amp; Provincial was 'a marginal set back in TSB's attempts to refocus
its business'.
This was, however, countered by reports that TSB was to sell Swan National
Leasing, its car leasing and contract hire firm, to Midland Bank.
In the drinks sector, the rumoured shareholder rebellion at the Greenalls
egm failed to muster the support needed to oppose the purchase of JA
Devenish. Dissident investors had complained that the Pounds 214.3m bid,
valuing Devenish at 394.5p a share, was too high. However, the bid was duly
approved. Greenalls put on 3 at 352p, while Devenish was steady at 360p.
Guinness, 4 off at 449p, flinched as Kleinwort Benson downgraded its profits
forecasts for the group and renewed its negative stance.
The broker cut by Pounds 18m to Pounds 947m for the current year, and Pounds
28m to Pounds 1.032bn for the following year. Analyst Mr David Thompson
blamed a combination of weak beer sales in Malaysia, general restructuring
costs and the failure of price increases in the UK to hold. He added that
the shares were unlikely to begin to outperform for another 18 months.
Several stocks in both the engineering and aerospace sectors benefited from
a weighty review from Panmure Gordon on the UK defence white paper.
The agency broker's buy list included British Aerospace, which shook off
recent worries about the funding of its regional jets joint venture with
Taiwan to end 8 ahead at 396p after 4.1m traded. GEC was another of the
stocks recommended by Panmure and ended 5 up at 334p on volume of 4.9m.
Its sell list included Rolls-Royce and Vickers, which closed  1/2 lighter at
137 1/2 p and a penny easier at 148p respectively.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 12m and the shares moved up 4 1/2 to 107p,
with James Capel said to have been positive on the stock.
Engineering group Bullough fell 8 to 111p after announcing a fall in
first-half profits to Pounds 500,000, from Pounds 5.89m last time. Profits
were hit by Pounds 4.67m in restructuring costs, although the dividend
remained at 1.75p.
An analysts visit saw hotelier Stakis advance a penny to 57p. Rank
Organisation remained friendless following the recent results and dividend
policy change. The shares declined 8 to 707p.
Food retailers stayed under a cloud following the raft of downgradings on
Tuesday. Tesco slipped 3 to 199p and Argyll Group 4 to 291p.
Cadbury-Schweppes, over which fears of brand name discounting have hung in
recent sessions, rallied 4 1/2 to 437 1/2 p. Unilever, which had been under
similar pressure, gained 5 at 952p.
A warning that magazine launches would impact on profits knocked 2 off the
shares of Emap, which closed at 338p. However, the chairman's statement at
the agm was upbeat about future trading.
Some recovery was made in the stock of Hartstone, the hosiery and leather
goods group, ahead of the posting of accounts and reports to shareholders.
There was also market talk of a persistent buyer. The share price moved up 4
to 49p.
Electricity utilities saw lively trading as their appeal as defensive stocks
held. Eastern firmed 3 to 485p, London 2 to 493p, Northern 2 to 523p and
Southern 3 to 492p. Norweb was the top performer with an increase of 9 to
530p, its attraction coming from being the only 'Rec' that remains
cum-dividend. A couple of the stocks showed slight declines - most likely as
money was switched into Norweb, said one market watcher.
National Power shed 5 to 351p and PowerGen gave up 7 to 372p as worries on
the review of the pool price continued. Some of the loss was also put down
to profit-taking.
The fortunes of Regalian Properties improved a little on reports that it had
sold its luxury Palace Green flats in central London. The shares went up 2
to 19 1/2 p.
A squeeze in Dixons left the stock 10 ahead at 210p.
Computer software producer Sage Group rallied after both NatWest Securities
and UBS said that the previous session's fall - from 504p to 385p - had been
overdone. The shares closed 29 higher at 414p. The company warned on
Wednesday that pre-tax profits and earnings per share for the year to
September this year would be lower than market expectations, although still
ahead of last year's figures.
Television issues continued to make headway. Scottish TV moved forward 3 to
519p, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV gained 5 at 203p, Central made the same advance
to close at 1963p and Carlton Communications put on 3 at 733p.
Anglia TV, which was boosted the previous day by a buy note from NatWest
Securities, added 6 at 331p.

FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome news

News that Wellcome had won a US court case to protect its patent on its
top-selling anti-Aids drug Retrovir sent the shares smartly forward. The
company had been challenged by a rival bio-tech company, Barr Laboratories,
over which organisation owned the patent to Zidovudine, the laboratory name
for Retrovir.
While the positive outcome for Wellcome had been widely expected by
pharmaceutical specialists, the publicity surrounding the case had been
adversely affecting market sentiment. Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett
commented: 'Any uncertainty over this patent challenge has now been lifted.'
However, he added that Wellcome, together with the rest of the drugs sector,
still faces an uncertain period ahead of the US healthcare reforms due in
September.
Wellcome, which yesterday also announced the retirement of its chairman on
the grounds of ill-health, surged 29 to 641p in turnover of 4.9m. After
several weak sessions, other healthcare stocks also bounced. Zeneca firmed 4
to 599p, as did SmithKline Beecham, to 425p. Embattled Medeva advanced 6 to
108p, and Glaxo was 13 higher at 534p on US buying.
